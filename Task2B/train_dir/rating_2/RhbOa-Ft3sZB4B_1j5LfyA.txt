Friendly service but the food was not impressive.  Won't say it was bad but wasn't impressive. My side salad was like eating a head of lettuce.  Gyro was okay.  The $20 for $10 deal was worth a cheap meal for 2 but I probably won't go back.
Well, it was a very late morning breakfast, so the staff may have just been recovering from a busy morning, but the service was not great.  Took a while to even get place settings.  The food was okay, but I was expecting better after seeing all the 4 star reviews.
This place is so unprofessional. I'm not going to deny that the food is good but they were advised that I have a condition where I eat and drink very slow. While I was still here , they cleared my table, wiped it and practically asked me to leave because there was a party of 7 waiting. They even pushed another table against ours and gave us the impression that we have to go. I have never been treated this way in my 8 yrs living in Vegas. If you are willing to stuff ur food down ur throat, chug ur drink and run out the door, I recommend this place and ask for Julie. They normally interviewed u as u r leaving but they didn't even try with me because maybe they saw I was uncomfortable and pissed. Oh I forgot, while I was eating, the waitress asked around 5 times if I wanted a box or take our plates. Too bad my wife us a food critic for a local newspaper and the review is not going to be as good as mine. This is insensitive to people with special needs. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IN GENERAL. Take it to go!!!
I didn't really care for the food and it was a little pricey. The gravy was salty, has browns were cold and my omelette was runny. I was extremely disappointed.
