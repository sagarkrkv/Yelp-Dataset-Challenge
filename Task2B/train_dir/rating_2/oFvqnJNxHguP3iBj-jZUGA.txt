I guess they stop the show after midnight =\
First time in Vegas, so my wife and I walked the strip and made sure we stopped by to check this out since everyone always says so much about it.  I won't lie, I just wasn't wowed by this.  It was free, so for free entertainment it was average.  I've been to botanical gardens back home on the east coast that have better fountain shows than this.  I hate to rip on it, because I was expecting to love it.  Sure, if I was on the strip and walking by I'd check it out again.  But knowing what I know now, I wouldn't ever choose to walk to the Bellagio just for the purpose of seeing this.  So I'd recommend checking it out if you are around, but don't go out of your way as it's average at best.
