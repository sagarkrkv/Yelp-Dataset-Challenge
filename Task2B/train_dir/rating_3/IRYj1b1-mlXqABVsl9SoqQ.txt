I really didn't think their would be much of a difference between the two locations, but the Charleston location trumps the LV BLVD location bad.. . Down to the payment station, this shop just doesn't do the El Gordo name justice.. . I do like the area of this one more, but the food was just not the same in my opinion.. . I ordered the usually Carne Asada fries and the Adobada tacos.. . Maybe I came on a bad day, but the steak wasn't cooked how I like and still being a bit pink.. . Having carne asada fries means the steak is grilled in my opinion.. . I don't mind a little pink in my steak, but this was disappointing. . . Also the sauces or salsas aren't made easily attainable so don't forget to ask.
I live in Los Angeles so there is an abundance of restaurants to get tacos so I have pretty high expectations.  I went to Tacos El Gordo as a spontaneous trip and it happened to be on a Saturday night.  It was very busy and the lines were long.  The wait wasn't too bad but there were 3 separate lines (different meat in each line) which isn't clear at all until the cooks yell it out.  So you could be in the front of the line and find out at the last minute that you are in the wrong line.  I had to constantly deal with other customers pushing through the lines to get to the soda machines.  Other than those things, the food was good but definitely try different meats.  I have gone twice and once I made the mistake of ordering 3 different items but with the same meat so everything tasted the same.  The menu isn't big but items are made to order and the tortillas are homemade.  All employees were working hard and I didn't notice any with attitudes.
Let me say that i thought the Adobada tacos are very good, but the Asada tacos are a disappointment and so are the carne asada fries.   And come on $2 for ea taco and $10 for the fries is a little tooo much. I've had better for way less.  I don't think i'll come back for a while...
Now, this is what I call Mexican food. I am such a sucker for verde sauce, corn tortillas, and the bustling market feel that I couldn't help but follow the hype. There are a few things on the menu that I have never heard of like Vampiro haha. Eventually, I'll try everything because their Adobada is dericious ~ . . Try it out! It's so affordable that you could miss out on your Big Mac for a day, I'm sure!
Nothing fancy, not worth the wait. The beef was okay, have had better. Typical Food, so so place
I pass by this place EVERY day on the way to work and I've always been curious if it was good or not. My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.. . This time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.. . I am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.. . This joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all.
Fresh, interesting, and big portions but lacking flavours in my opinion. needs more salt or seasoning. I should have ask for some hot sauce or something to give it more flavour.
The price point is perfect! ~ $3 tacos depending on what kind of meat you order.. . They offer all kinds of options (carne asada, brain, tongue, etc) - so you have to find the person serving the kind of meat you want and get in that particular line to place your order.  You'll have to ask which line has what because there are no signs.. . .. and it's weird because even if you're first in line (and you're at the counter ready to place your order) - if someone next to you has a tray of food and is waiting to place an order, they actually get to order BEFORE YOU because Tacos El Gordo has to serve those with food on their tray first.. that's right, they get to order before you, even though you were in line first... Tsk, Tsk!. . They don't have chicken (aka pollo) - so if you're not a red meat person this might not be the place for you.
Reading about their carne asada fries is what brought us in here - my husband judges every taco shop/stand by their carne asada fries. We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork. . . It is a bit confusing about how/where to order, seems like that problem couldbe solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!. . We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it. . . If I were to go back I would probably try some of the tacos, and also just order the fries with the spicy pork, I enjoyed that a lot more than the carne asada.
This is a chain of Mexican fast food joints. There are at least two in Las Vegas, and god knows how many elsewhere. The one on the Strip is on the same side of the street as Wynn and Encore, and a little further north.. . ***The Menu***. You can order quesadillas, tostadas and such, but most of the menu is tacos: taco de asada (steak), adobada (spicy pork), tripa (tripe) and a host of others. Tacos are small (around 3 to 4 inches in diameter), with a heaping tablespoonful of meat, cilantro and other spices in the center. Two tacos make for a modest lunch; four would be a hearty dinner.. . ***The Atmosphere***. Pretty much like any other fast food restaurant. There are a few tables inside, and many more outside.. . ***My Meal***. I've only eaten one lunch here, so I can't comment on much of the menu. However, I am hopeful. I tried two tacos: taco de cabeza (beef head); taco de buche (pork stomach). The taco de cabeza wasn't as unusual as it sounds. In taste and texture it was pretty much like minced steak. I liked it, and think it would please most people. The taco de buche was by far my favorite: lots of flavor and good texture. To wash it down, I had a bright red, strawberry soda.. . ***Summary***. After one meal, I want to go back. The tortillas are good, the fillings are good, and there are lots more to try.. . ***The Bill***. The meal was $5.72, for two tacos, a soda, and tax.
Not bad at all for a little taco spot on the strip.  A couple friends recommended this place so we went.  It was easy to find and everything was easy about this place. We walked in and there are menus in front of you before you walk in and when you walk in. . Here's how you do it. You walk up to the counter, I'd go to the left counter because everyone goes to the first counter they see when they walk in (creates a cluster-f*ck). Once you see the Al Pastor (spicy pork) spinning with that chunk of pineapple on the top and bottom, your mouth should start watering. I ordered 2 carne asada (steak) tacos, hubby ordered 1 carne asada taco and one Al Pastor tostada. They put all the condiments on for you so if you are a condiment nazi (like one of my friends) make sure you ask for it on the side. I wanted it the way it came, with everything on it. As soon as you get your food take it to the cashier, order any drinks you may want, and pay. I couldn't resist the orange and pineapple bang!! As soon as we sat down I scarfed down my tacos like nothing, they were pretty good, Zeke loved the Al Pastor, it's his favorite and he said it was really good. Be sure to ask for napkins from the cashier because that is the only place you'll find them. There are no napkins to grab anywhere else, just from the cashier. Also, if you need to use the restroom you have to ask for the key from the cashier. I stood by the restroom waiting for someone to come out like a geek for a while until an employee told me to get the key. Doh! . Anyways, if you're looking for some good street tacos to satisfy your late night munchies, to sober up, or cuz you're hungry for some... I'd say come to this place.
To be honest I think most times I've ate TEG I've been way too drunk... I mean it's perfect for when you have the drunk munchies and it's conveniently located on the strip... .  In my opinion (shhh don't tell Mike C & James K) I think the food here looks better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong it's pretty yummy but I don't find myself craving it.. I feel like it's just your standard taco shop food that I can get from a regular taco truck parked on the street somewhere.. Oh and be careful I didn't think those grilled peppers could be that hot but last time I had a bite and my mouth was on FIRE for a hour.. lol . . Hot Tip: don't forget to ask for some pineapple & drink the orange bang! OH And chat up the cooks and tip em.. They hook it up!!!
Now here is a favorite spot for the late night clubbing crew....  . . Tacos El Gordo runs all night long to cater to those party people who literally just got out of XS...... and are super hungry!. . Be aware of the long lines!!!  It sort of goes quick but nevertheless it's still a long ol line to be waiting in.... . Quick eats for after clubbing!  Which Taco would you like?. . They are famous for the pastor taco!  Spicy Shaven pork on the spinner rotisserie is a crowd favorite!  But they also have tons of other stuff as well!  (gotta try their super nacho!  It is humongous!). . Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!. . They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!. . You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!. . Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!. . To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!. . Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next timeyou are near!
Cheap, fast, taco place. $2.00 street tacos, $4 quesadillas, and $5 half order fries (with meat) or $10 for full order. OK, so $2.00 isnt exactly CHEAP for street tacos, but this is near the strip and nothing else is that cheap around the area. i had the spicy pork taco which was good and we shared the half order of fries with pork. i dont know what kind of creamy white sauce they put on the fries, but it was really good. . . the best part of the experience was the lady helping us with our order. you're suppose to just walk up to the counter and order from the cooks, but one of the ladies came up and asked us if we needed help ordering. she explained almost the entire menu to us (which is pretty small) but as indecisive as i was, she was very patient with me and waited until i finally decided on my ONE taco.. . the worst part of the experience (this is more for the BF), is that he had an upset stomach later that night from his two tacos and fries. :(
The place is very inexpensive and the service was lively and entertaining, the one guy behind the counter could do a plate every minute it seemed.  The tacos were ok.  The meat i got was so-so; pork was better than the beef.  But I enjoyed the atmosphere which is well described in other reviews.
Fairly solid place when compared to the mecca (So Cal.).  We tried most of their meats, including brain tacos.  Everything was good if not great.  The ordering is a little confusing and one needs to be assertive to get the attention of an expediter.  The only thing that is sadly disappointing is the hot sauce.  They put a a couple of tablespoons on each taco, but if that doesn't suffice then you ask for more at the register.  The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served.. Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.  . It is in a mexi part of Vegas which is good.  I would return but am still on the hunt for more Mexi-Vegas places.
I usually eat at this place every single time I go to San Diego, so naturally in comparison it's not as good. But amongst other taco places in Vegas, it's still super good. Only problem is the workers are super slow most of the times that I've gone, inefficient and all over the place. One guy was super rude as he was making the taco. Almost made you want to walk away. But if you catch them on the good day, it's really worth it, and good prices too!
They have a confusing system of ordering first at one of the two cooking stations then paying at one of the two cashier stations you hope have an employee at them so you know where to pay. I was so confused for the first 10 minutes I was there. That, and my arm got burned by a fleck of something that came off the grill across the way while I was just waiting for my food. I asked for a cup for water and was given one, but they didn't have a dispenser for water at either of their two drink fountains! I tried pulling the little tab under the Sprite that is normally water, but all I got was super flat and disgusting tasting Sprite. I  was super irritated!. . Apart from that, the spicy pork tacos are epically amazing and deserve 5 stars alone. I wasn't a fan of any of the other tacos.. . I soooo had wished my experience would've been better so I could justify going back here for more tacos. Make sure to ask for everything on them, cause the extra additions and sauces make the tacos taste so much better.
Great location right on Las Vegas Bvld! It is even better that It is opened late (i think 24 hrs?). I stopped by after a night of clubbing and drinking. It definitely hit the spot. Possibly the cheapest food on the Strip! Everything was salty IMO. A squeeze of lime made it better. . -Cow brain: yes you heard me! Try it. I had cow brain before and this was not too tasty and fresh. I think it lost some creaminess and the flavor was not working for me. Fun to try. Not the best I've had. . -Tripe - my second favorite. tripe was clean and tender. . -Beef shoulder - my favorite. Beef was tender. . -Lengua - It was not good. Too salty. . Would I come back? maybe if it was late and I was hungry. Good location but not the best tacos I've had.
For the Strip, this is a pretty good option for food. It's a bit out of the way (like a mile from the center of the Strip) and compared to the trucks that abound around LA, the price is high (about $2+ for a tiny taco with only one tortilla if my memory serves me correctly, while LA trucks use two), but the flavor is pretty darn yummy. Try out a few including the cabeza (cow's head), which is tender as can be. The alpastor on the other hand is tasty but a bit overdone. My co-eater pal like the crispiness of the meat--and I can always appreciate meat cooked to the point where I can't feel the fat, but this made it a bit tough to eat... I prefer a little more tenderness. . . Bottom line: Compared to the mediocre buffets all over the Strip that cause you to indulge to your stomach's limits, this is a quick and easy place to eat just enough while getting some bang for your buck.
i don't know hooow this place got such high reviews... i think it's over hyped.. . nevertheless, i wouldn't mind stopping by again when i'm staying at Wynn or Encore.  the tacos are SO much cheaper than what they got in the hotel!! totally worth the short walk from Encore lol. . their salsa is fantastic! it makes chipotle's look like a joke.  don't underestimate it though, it's hella spicy! i'm from east coast so i was loving the authenticity of mexican food from southern west coast.  the steak taco is recommended-- i couldn't get myself to try those cow brains and w/e strangeness they were offering.. . . just a quick note about their quesadillas.. they're not your typical american quesadillas.. it looks something like between a sandwich and a salad.. bottomline--  it's really hard to eat! . . but yeah, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place even if you love nothing but tacos.
What a great place to get some food when you are hungover and need some greasy tacos to ease that headache. Some things are great about this place and others that I could pass on.. . The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.. . The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too. . . Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.. . The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered. . . The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.. . So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.. . Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating.
Updated review: 3.5 stars. . Carne asada fries $10, not worth the price!  Not as good as Alberto's. the lengua tacos are good and very tender. The spicy pork tacos are good too. If I have to compare, the taco truck in pasadena,CA is better, taste wise and price-wise.
I had HIGH expectations when I came but disappointed after trying the food. . . - Carne asada meat tasted way too smoky . - Carne asada fries are not worth $10! Lacks pico de gallo. Albertos/Albatras/Alertos are way better! . . + Only meat that was good was abodaba. . Tips. *There are different lines for the meat 1) asada 2) adobada 3) lengua, cabeza, etc. . *Grilled peppers & onions are free, just got to ask for it. . *You might be able to order some carne asada tacos in the abodaba line (just ask the worker if you can add it to your order)
Maybe I'm too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of H street in San Diego... Nothing comes even remotely close to it. Overall food was ok; priced just right. I say try it you'll probably like it!
Went over labor day weekend to Vegas.  So let me get to the meat of this.  If its crowded which it was for us, don't expect to find a place to sit and eat your meal.  It is lacking tables or areas to enjoy your tacos.  So you stand in specific lines and those lines only serve those items otherwise you have to stand in line again.  The organization of it all doesn't allow you to get a variety of tacos.  Different if you are not used to it.  We settled for carne asada tacos and wanted to get the spicy pork but again didn't want to begin all over again.  When we got outside there were people whose family members were still in line who had grabbed any table and just waited.  Meanwhile we were looking to find a ledge, a chair, and finally settled for a curb near the restaurant.  There were cockaroaches near the curb that we were sitting at and well, again...no tables which lowered my rating for the restaurant.  Otherwise the food is very good.  Authentic Mexican food.
The tacos were delish.  The way to order was too long.  People were everywhere so I was starting to get a headache from just trying to focus and wait patiently in line.
Clusterf*ck. Zoo. Frustrating. One line is for al pastor, one line is for carne asada, etc, etc., which means you have to endure multiple slow-ass lines if you want different meats. Bf wasn't too impressed with $2 tacos; he thought the prices were high for taqueria food (I.e. $10 for carne asada fries.) . . I chose not to order any meat on my fries at all because the threat of meat contamination was imminent...I could just see it now -- I order steak & end up with tongue & brains chopped up in my meal. No f*cking thank you. . . My fries were covered in cheese, guac, & crema. I asked for red sauce, which helped moisten & spice up my mess of crispy, creamy, fatty goodness. 4 stars for the fries & having orange bang in the soda fountain. 3 stars for the crowd & irritating order process (line up to order, line up to pay.) . . I'm sure he'll want to go back, but in my expert Mexican-food opinion, it ain't all that. I'd prefer to go elsewhere.
My carne asada tacos were dried. I was hoping it was going to be bomb, but it was not all that.  Tacos are small.
As people said, there are separate lines for each kind of taco. My go to taco is usually the lengua. Some people are uncomfortable eating tongue, but honestly it's some of the most tender meat possible. . . Unfortunately I was little underwhelmed by the lengua here. The meat wasn't as savory as I've had at other places.. . Looking at the reviews, I guess I should have tried the pork. Maybe next time...
This is probably the first time I have seen a tacos being sold in vegas... with the exception of your local fast food restaurant with their fake tacos. So I think that it was very smart of the El Gordo owners to have opened this shop here. I cam here in the wee morning and everything was pretty organized. It was crowded for the wee morning.. but this is on the Strip. So no surprise there.. . I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac? Not sure but I think this is what makes El Gordo special. The pork was season great and it's always nice to see a traditional taco place with their pork rotating on its skewer in front of the fire.. . I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.. . My experiences with tacos have come a long way because of LAs vast offerings. I still prefer the traditional hand made tortillas and taco carts from the streets of Highland Park in LA.
Good spot to come and eat after a night of drinking. I don't speak Spanish so it's hard for me to communicate to some of them but I do like the tacos. Other than the spanish....It's good! . Iwould just recommend the carne asada tacos or the "pastor" tacos?  Everyone says these tacos are "real" and "authentic" so I trust that!  Better than taco bell haha.
Good tacos. Sometimes too busy and have to wait in long lines. Specially when it is cold.
People go nuts for this place, me? Eeehhh..... The tacos are pretty good but not amazing. The wait to order is usually insane. Last time I was there, there were 4 separate lines and the lines stretched outside (should be an indication of amazingness but no), needles to say we waited for like 40 min to order. I don't think they're 40 min wait good... The lines are usually crazy and chaotic so be prepared. . They do have a nice variety of meats for a fast food type of joint. They have options like chicken, steak, beef shoulder, tongue, brain and spicy pork. The spicy pork is the best! Those are 4*.
