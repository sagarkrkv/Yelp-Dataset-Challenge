This is a must see show. Old world variety/cabaret with a modern twist. Just like classic Commedia Dell'Arte Absinthe revels in the baseness of humanity to get us to laugh at ourselves while highlighting how amazingly awesome we can also be. Cirque fans will love seeing world class acts up close and comedy fans will love how edgy and risky the vibe is. This show makes you literally hoot and holler. It's been four days since I've seen it and I'm still high from the experience!
Vegas shows used to be all about tits, ass and feathers...but somewhere in the last 10 years the scene was hijacked by a pretentious gang of artsy-fartsy Quebecois poseurs who want us to believe we are experiencing high-brow art. NEWSFLASH, dumbasses: it's still tits, ass and feathers! OK, so the tits are the flat, athletic kind...and the makeup is conceptual....but still. Same shit, different show: O, KA, Le Reve, Love, Mystere, blah blah blah blah blah.. . Absinthe is the polar opposite of all those pretentious Cirque extravaganzas. It's in a little outdoor tent in front of Caesars Palace, and the stage is only about 8 feet in diameter, so no matter where you're sitting, you are in immediate danger of being hit by flying Russians and roller skates. No safety net, no smokescreens, no remove at all between audience and performers... and lots of swearing. That's the Russian way!. . The show is billed as an adult carnival, and it's basically an old-time circus acrobat revue chock-full of hot hardbodies fresh from the Eastern Bloc, with a few lip-synced burlesque numbers and some obscene banter between the emcee (the Gazillionaire) and his ditzy assistant Penny. But despite its humble premise, it's AWESOME! The hot Russian acrobats, as mentioned, are flipping and flying and skating and tight-rope-walking right over your head, and the tent is so small that you can hear every grunt and groan and joint popping. It is a much needed dose of realism on a street packed full of fake-ass dreams.. . My favorite part, though, is the obscene banter. I love me some dirty talk, and any show that has an 18+ age restriction is OK by me! I'm tired of listening to washed-up baby-boomers make corny, family-friendly  jokes to appease their corporate masters... it's about f*ckin' time someone tried something different!  . . In summation: if you're edgy, alternative, punk rock, Bohemian, artsy-fartsy or any of those annoying things (as I am), you'll dig this show.  This ain't no pantywaisted Cirque... this is Russian TSIRK! Long may it last!
When you walk up, eyebrows raised, you're not really sure what's going on here or what to expect.  The beer garden is interesting, but once you make your way into the tent, wooden plank floors, the smell of an old wooded cantina.....you feel like you are in an old jankity tent.  But it's soooo cool!  Sit in the front, you might get picked on to do a lap dance or something else you would be embarrassed doing all in exchange for free Absinthe booze..... or if you want to see your life flash before you....up close and personal is an understatement!  There is a rollerskating couple who I swear, I'm going to keep them in my prayers everyday that they don't die during their routine.  Go see it quick before something happens to them, it's CRAZY!. Don't be offended by the racist, sexist, rude, or raunchy remarks by the 'host'.. . One word.....fun!. . I can't wait to go again.
Absinthe is a great 90 minute show.  The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.. . When I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.. . If you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.. . VIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also "picked on" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.. . The acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.. . I highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!
Dear Absinthe,. . THANK YOU. SO, SOOO MUCH.. . This show has to be the BEST thing to happen to The Strip since Frank Sinatra. Yes, you heard right. The amazing variety of the format, from a beautiful Burlesque singer, to death-defying roller skating, chair-stacking and no-net high-wire numbers leaving the audience at first terrified for their own safety, followed by spontaneous and uproarious standing ovations. All rolled along smoothly by an outrageously funny, improv-genius MC duo.. . One of the coolest features of Absinthe has got to be the century-old Spiegeltent housing the show, and the kooky/magical beer garden outside. There are thousands of mirrors adorning the structure, and a ring of stained glass windows above the audience. If Vegas is about fantasy, you are definitely transported to a world unlike any other you can find around town, without feeling like you're on a ride at Disneyland.. . The show's star (and I say star because other than the MC's, she's the only performer who appears multiple times) is the singer, whose real name is Melody Sweets (she plays the Green Absinthe Fairy). Not only is she gorgeous and engaging to every single audience member in the tent, but I found out that the songs she sings -- and does stripteases to, yum -- are her very own originals!! I thought at first she might be lip-syncing, but then she says snarky little things to the folks in the front rows, like getting them to snap their fingers, and you soon realize that she's just hands-down a great singer. Okay okay, so I was a little taken with her, but I bet you will be too!!. . Amid all the the beauty and acrobatics and vintage atmosphere, the real grease that keeps this mile-a-minute show squeaking by with a wink and a nod are the funniest MC combo since Martin and Lewis...their names are the Gazillionaire, whose limitless money is supposedly funding the show, and his adorable assistant Penny, whose ditzy antics quickly take a turn for the dirty and hilarious. They both seize upon audience members with breathtaking spontaneity, making you feel like the particular 85-minute show you are attending is unique...which, of course, it is.. . Insider's tip: if you can't get VIP tix, get there early to line up, as it's first-come, first-served seating and you definitely want to be in the front rows!! Don't sweat the wait; grab a beer and soak in the atmosphere outside the tent.... . It's allll part of the show, folks.
Awesome show! High-paced variety acts, fun hosts, audience interaction. I was on the edge of my seat (yes fairly uncomfortable wooden chair, but oh well) most of the show. The performers are crazy, the roller skating act is almost worth it alone...holy yikes!! . . Is it ok for kids? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Also, not recommended if you offend easily. Crude jokes galore! . . We got $54 (incl tax/fees) tickets from one of the Half Price Ticket vendors inside the Fashion Show mall, near TI. . . I would recommend getting to the beer garden area about an hour before the show, hang out and have some drink and enjoy the atmosphere. It's a general admission show, so everyone lines up and you pick your own seat. We were pretty far back in line so I was afraid we would get crappy seats but we still ended up in the 3rd row. I'd say there isn't a bad seat in the venue since its a round center stage. . . I have recommended it to all my friends!
Not for the timid or easily offended, this show is a hoot.  Sexy, naughty and nasty,  which just happened to be some of my favorite things.  Great performances with a tremendously funny host and super sexy- silly hostess.  Some very original acts that I haven't seen in other shows, plus a few familiar favorites.   Definitely recommend it for those who like something a bit different and more edgy.
GO SEE THIS NOW!! Acrobats + Burlesque + Naughty Comedy + Cabaret +Awesome Venue! Zumanity's edgier, funnier kid brother! Never been to a show where the standing ovation was so quick, automatic and sustained!. . This is the BEST show ever. Though lovely, I've gotten sleepy eyed at many Cirque shows -- but not here! Everything about this show, from the moment you walk into the beer garden to when you exit is designed to transport you to another place and time. The ambiance totally makes you forget you're in Vegas in the middle of the Strip. . . The show is held in a sectioned off portion of the Caesar's Palace near Serendipity called "Spiegelworld." When you're about to enter, there is no hint of what to expect beyond the gates. Once in, you're immediately struck by the Tim Burton-like set featuring a central "tree house" constructed from metal railings, chairs, birdcages and a spiral staircase. The string lights add a whimsical, carnival-like feel. Dotted around the grounds are various tables and chairs made from various odds and ends like bathtubs and wooden crates. This area is called the beer garden.. . When we entered there was already a line even though we arrived 30 minutes early. From my understanding, all seats are general admission. Even though we were near the end of the line, we got fabulous seats only 3 rows from the stage and didn't miss out on getting some great beer.. . For anyone who has ever seen Cabaret the musical, this show will be totally up your alley. Cabaret has the Emcee; Absinthe has it's Gazillionaire. He's really the driving force behind the feel of the show. He's kitschy, naughty, hilarious and has incredible chemistry with his assistant Penny.. . The performances are fantastic. Of particular magnificence were the skating duo (amazing!), the strong men acts and the parody-performance by the Gazillionaire and Penny.    . . Though we got same day tickets at the 1/2 price vendors, the show was so good I would have gladly paid double. Shows are Tuesday to Sunday, dark on Mondays.
Do not miss this show! It was one of the coolest shows I have ever seen in Las Vegas. The stage is so small you feel like you are in the middle of the act and that just doesn't happen a lot in Vegas. Try getting your tickets across the street at Bill's Gamblin Hall Tix4Tonite booth and save $20 bucks like I did.
I went to this show tonight and it was funny!!! Some real hot european girls in it as well.... the host of the show was great, made me laugh my ass off as well as this comedic "silk act".... the show is basically Cirque Du Soleil style in a small tent in front of Ceasers Palace..... also this guy and girl act on roller skates was real neat.
Simply put, one of the BEST live shows I've ever seen.. . In Vegas for a bachelor party, seven of us headed to the Half Price Tickets booth to find a deal for a burlesque show of some sort (only criteria was boobs, really). Thankfully one of the ticket agents started raving about Absinthe, and he hadn't even seen it yet! This supported by a quick check against Yelp reviews, and we had seven tickets in hand (well, not really; you get a receipt that you exchange for the tickets at Caesar's). I think we paid $48 per ticket.. . In any case, the big top is located in a fenced-in area adjacent to Caesar's Palace, and is honestly a great waiting area. A small but excellent offering of draught beers are on tap (Chimay and Kronenbourg 1664), and there're lots of seating splayed about. Arrive at least 30 minutes before the show, and do make an effort to get into line early. The seating is general admission, and we were very pleased sitting in the third row. Note: I would avoid the seating area directly opposite from the main entrances; parts of the performance take place near/behind this area, and I noticed some patrons had to turn right around to watch.. . I went into the show completely dumb about the kind of acts I would see, so I won't go into that detail here (the surprise added to the thrill of the performance). I'll just say that there will be singing, humour, and tons of acrobatics. One of the acts had me feeling incredibly anxious (and not a lot gets a stir out me), with other patrons literally being unable to watch. . . Finally, not only were there boobs, but these women were gorgeous, and incredibly fit and athletic. Not to be out done, the shirtless male performances reminded us of how pathetic we all are, as we downed our beers. This really is a show for both sexes, and I've been damn near adamant that a friend's bachelorette party see this when they're in Vegas soon.. . Our voices were coarse by the end of the spectacle from all the hootin' and hollerin'. There's no doubt in my mind that this topped any show we could have seen in Vegas - burlesque, Cirque, or otherwise!
This show was a BLAST!  One of the best live shows I have seen so far.  It has everything acrobatics, comedy, and great seating.  We heard such good things about it and we are so happy we gave it a try.  The beer garden was a great place to relax while waiting for the doors to open, but the drinks are overpriced.  I would recommend walking right outside to the Bacardi Bar if you want cheaper drinks. . If you are looking for a great show...YOU MUST SEE IT!!  I saw some of the prior posts about uncomfortable seating, but I wasn't uncomfortable at all.  The isle's are a bit narrow but I walked freely without hitting anyone so they are wider than a movie theater.  We were the 6th people to line up at the door so we had excellent seats on the 3 row.  Be sure and start lining up 30 min. before the show (no assigned seating).. The show itself makes you feel like you are part of the action.  And some lucky audience members did get to participate.  The comedy was really funny...not cheesy at all like I was expecting.  Some of these performers are beyond words.  It truly is a show you just have to see to appreciate.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
Absolutely AWESOME!!! It's a MUST SEE! Lisa Lampanelli meets the circus! . . I was reluctant at first, but it was amazing! See Absinthe while it's still in Vegas!
Amazing!  Stop searching and go buy tickets!  I bought these last minute and couldn't have been happier about the whole experience.  It is as good (actually better in my opinion) than any Cirque shows.  Why?  Because it is funny, edgy, and acrobatic.  Also we waited until almost everyone had lined up and we still had great seats!!!!  It was truly entertainment at its best.
ABSINTHEloutly a must see! Escape the douchiness of the Vegas club scene at the "beer garden" which literally kisses the edge of the Strip. Near Ceasars Palace? Detour now pedestrians. Anyone can enter the quirky drinking arena for some relaxing libations combined with an outstanding eclectic music mix ranging from punk to hip hop and beyond-no cover charge-drink prices decent for being on the strip. I will come back simply to hang here for cocktails, friendly conversation, smart music mix and street smarty/arty/carni vibe. My advice is to arrive EARLY, walk around, explore and absorb what this drinking area has to offer. BAM! We're off to a great start, and the show has yet to begin. Absinthe is simply-beautiful, flirty, comedic, and dirty. The round stage can't be more than 15 feet in diameter, with a mere 5 rows of seats circling the stage, elevating the thrill factor ten fold. There are someserious acrobats and other circus acts that are nothing short of mesmerizing, and are appreciated even more with everyone's up close seating. The intimacy adds to the level of danger and excitement. Seriously, one slip, and....well...never mind. Lets just say there are no safety nets-I like that. The tent is also beautifully done, creaky hardwood floors, square wooden-almost elegant tent poles, red velvet booths line the perimeter of the tent, with matching red velvet at the dome. Think hints of Bourbon Street, and 19th century traveling shows. The ring leader/Gazillionaire is Don Rickles meets Andy Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton. Penny is a hilarious cutie a la a raunchy Gracie Allen. Leave your political correctness at the door please. Oh! The music...jeeze...Doris Day, to Wild Beasts, to Bon Jovi, Bobby Darren, Muse, The Hollies, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, and Susan Boyle, just to name a few. Smart and silly, quirky and cirquey with a little burlesquey. Yeah, I kinda liked it.
Amazing show!!!!! I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Worth skipping the big names of O or Zoomanity for this hilarious, more intimate acrobatic display!! The beer garden is a lot of fun too!!
Since this was our first time in Vegas and there were so many shows to choose from, we did a lot of research. Based on Yelp reviews, we chose Absinthe.  Boy, what a riot!!!  From the beginning to the end, we were entertained.  Gazillionaire and Peggy were hilarious.  The "bodyguard" duo was  amazing.  And the rollerskater duo was crazy.  I would definitely recommend Absinthe to anyone who is visiting Vegas.
Best show I have ever seen in Vegas. Its a great mix of insult comedy, cirque du soleil level acrobatics just a few feet from your chair. Plus a little burlesque thrown in for good measure. The Gazillionaire and Penny are so funny my side was hurting from laughing. . Well worth the $49 ticket price for locals.  i'm going to see if again next week. I rarely see a show more than twice. But I get the feeling this show will be a little different every time.
Sexy time... Oh yeah!. . Imagine that being purred with a eastern European accent and you've summed up my sentiments.. . I'm not a big "show" person. I suffer from a slight case of ADD and cringe when forced to watch lengthy performances on TV, let alone the live version. Actually, I'm kind of famous for ducking out of most live shows early no matter what. Seriously, I don't even know what happens in the third act of Les Miserables - and who really cares? Based on the first two acts and the setting, I figure they all die anyway.. . But I digress. Absinthe didn't have me too worried - I had barely gotten off the plane and was whisked away to a Cesar's Palace circus tent. No time to hem and haw about this one. Based on the flea market aesthetic of the outdoor "lobby" (complete with shuffleboard table) and the fact that they're slinging drinks before you even get to your seats, this was already shaping up to be a good night. . . As most have already said in their reviews, the show itself is a mixture of comedy, acrobatics and vaudeville. It's definitely not for the uber-conservative crowd that's seeking a Celine Dion-esque experience. Think: pasties, repeated use of the "f word", a sock puppet sex simulation and the slightest peek of a dude's junk. No, I would not take my parents here. Your parents, however, might be into it... it just depends.. . From start to finish, I think the show lasts about an hour and a half? Just the right amount of time. I laughed. A lot. And I couldn't keep my eyes off the stage, which is a sign that it's more than enough entertainment for one person.
Best show I've seen in a long time.  I laughed until I cried.  Everything was great.  The comedy, the acrobatics, the music, the intimate venue.  LOVED IT.  Everyone was raving about it after the show.
Absinthe is a fantastic show!!. . A group of us went to the 9:30p Saturday night show. We took advantage of the $49/ticket locals special. I believe it's good through the end of June 2011.. . WOW it such a fun, sexy, crazy show! Like others have commented, the seating is first come, first serve so don't let Ticketmaster tell you otherwise. They almost messed us up had we not decided to just go early anyway. Our group consisted of 5 people so it was worth it to arrive 40 mins early (the line was slightly long) but we were able to all sit together in the 4th row. That was close enough to enjoy the show. The "tent" venue is very small. The stage is teeny tiny, but that's what adds to the show's atmosphere.. . I am not an absinthe-alcohol fan (I don't care for the black licorice taste) so I sipped on a jack and diet coke. Definitely having a drink to loosen up helps as some of thejokes and comedy are very off-color (i.e. visuals of a unicorn with male genitalia on its head instead of a horn) with a good measure of racism. I wouldn't recommend this show for children/teens or ultra-conservative adults. That said, it is a hilarious show and if you are aware of what the show consists of going in you will enjoy your experience.. . Our absolute favorite portion of the show were the rollerskaters. When you see the show, you will know what I'm talking about! :). . All the performers were outstanding and the entire cast really works their buns off during the entire show. No slackers or lagging performances here. Go see it!
Utterly spectacular.  I've been to quite a few shows (Love, Peepshow, Zumanity, Crazy Horse, Jubilee...) and this one was one of the best!. . Get there an hour early and enjoy the beer tent.  Chimay on tap and cornhole set up in the courtyard.. . My only negative comment - the show is an hour and a half long.  The rows are awkward at best to get out of, and for the last half hour you aren't allowed to use the aisles because part of the act is in the aisle.  So ladies - make sure you use the rest room before the show!!
This show absolutely deserves all 5 stars, and it's fitting that it currently averages 5, it's amazing awe inspiring and jaw dropping.. . It's hilarious and there is both raunch humor shock value and acrobatic shock value (roller skaters!!!) My big group and I kept quoting the jokes and raving nonstop about the routines, especially the skaters who we've been watching on endless look on youtube! . . The whole cast is so sexy, too! Which doesn't hurt. i thought the burlesque style girl in all her emerald green and katy perry esque dark hair was absolutely gorgeous!. . This show is just about perfect; the only caveat I'd add is DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS! Go with grown ups. . . Seriously obsessed with the roller skaters! And the guys who went from security guard to acrobats were amazing as well, the two emcees were super funny.
THE best show I have ever seen in Las Vegas. The show was recommended to us by a helpful cabbie and we couldn't have been more pleased. The show is unpretentious and doesn't take itself too seriously which is a welcomed change from the snooty pretentiousness of modern Vegas. It's sort of Cirque-esque with some acrobatics and death defying acts (the roller skating people were intense!). The intimiate setting of the show is ideal for the performances as they are literally a few feet in front (or above) you. In some instances, audience members are advised not to stand up or talk b/c that is literally how close and personal the show is. . . The show has some (tasteful) nudity and some singing numbers. Be sure to get your tickets from Tix4Tonight. We got tickets for 51 (at the box office it was 69). Arrive early to get the best seats (but be warned, if you sit in the front you may get picked on by the hilarious Gazillionaire)!
By far the best show in Vegas. The only bad thing is the seats.  They are tight and very uncomfortable. Once you get past that this show is funny, jaw dropping, amazing, OMG incredible. You are so close to the action its amazing no one in the audience gets hurt. And the performers are incredible. I don't know how to say it any other way. GO SEE IT!
Loved the show, especially the small, up close and personal setting.  When the MC (the Gazillionaire) says don't stand up, or you'll get kicked, he isn't kidding.  Can be a little raunchy, and definitely not for the strait laced types, with the barely there pasties, but a fun show.  Acrobatics are the forte, the singing was so-so, but a good transition from the various acts.  Loved the bubble girl too.
This show was so much fun!  . . Definitely get the VIP tickets so you can go through the green telephone booth and get free cocktails!!!. . You also get priority seating with these tickets and get to swing in hammocks and sit in old creepy dentist chairs in a secret room :). . This show had the coolest acrobatics, my favorite was the couple on roller skates.. . Angel Porrino (from "Holly's World") is in one act that is pretty cute. . . You will not be disappointed by this show and afterwards you can go in Caesar's and win a bunch of money.
How is this show not sold out until 2020? I was able to get six tickets to the Saturday night show over Memorial Day weekend with only a few days advance notice. The show didn't even sell out and after attending I cannot understand why. I have seen every Cirque Show in Vegas as well as several other non CDS shows and this one is my new favorite. It is everything you would expect from a Vegas Show. It's a funny, sexy, mind boggling, show set in an intimate lounge type location. There really isn't a bad seat in the house and the performers are so close you feel like you are part of the act. When you see how sexy some of the performers are you might wish you were part of the show. . . A lot of people have commented that the show is vulgar and over the top but I disagree. The Gazillionaire and his sidekick were like any other emcee or. Comedy act you would see across the country. Do they swear? Yes.  Do they make sexual jokes? Yes. Do they offend all races equally? Yes. Was it entertaining? Unbelievably so.  If you can get tickets to this show you will be amazed. The ticket prices are much more. affordable than any Cirque show and the acts are every bit as impressive if not more. Our group of six was blown away. Having our own beer garden with Cornhole and shuffleboard after the show was an added bonus.
Fucking shit!! What a great show. A billion thanks to RACHEL S. for the hookup!! . . This was the only show I've wanted to see this year. I was pretty excited beforehand and it was all that and more. A couple of glasses of Chimay in the beer garden had us in a great mood. Really cool circus tent set up and transports you to another place altogether. Stage setting is great..talk about in your face! We were lucky to snag seats in the left side of the 1st row. . . The acts were incredible with my fave being the rollerskating couple. My heart rate was not only up since their act blew me away but also because they were SO CLOSE to us. One slip up would've sent the female skater hurling into the first 3 rows. . . The gazillionaire and his assistant had our sides splitting in laughter throughout the show. Definitely don't bring people easily offended by off color jokes. I also wouldn't recommend taking your mother...unless she'd down to touch tongues with another random chick. Don't ask..just go!!!!!!
I was afraid I was becoming jaded to Strip entertainment.  After seeing countless Cirque shows, the bar was so raised that I was afraid Absinthe might let me down.. . Soooo wrong on so many counts.  Absinthe is by far the most interesting show in Vegas right now.  Yes, suck it, Celine.. . The venue adds to the interest.  The show is held in a small, turn-of-the-century-esque tent in the middle of the under used Caesar's courtyard.  Inside is a small intimate setting with wooden chair seating (beware, they're uncomfortable but they add to the experience).  The aesthetic is incredible and lends to the feeling that you're truly at a retro carnival.  . . Some of the acts are similar to stuff you'll see at Cirque but they step it up several notches.  You truly wonder about  the performers' safety because they're not wearing harnesses. A worker's comp extravaganza.  And, during the roller skating act, it is very possible you may get kicked in the face during a death-defying stunt.  If you want real excitement (and possible head trauma), you'll find it here.  You're so close the action you can see every muscle flex and every bead of sweat.  I've seen nothing else like it.. . The comedy, however, makes this show and sets it apart from the rest. The Gazillionaire and Penny are hilarious and make the transitions as great as any of the acts. But, If you're thinking about bringing your ultra-conservative grandmother, she'll probably write you out of her will.  This show is risque and not for the Donny and Marie crowd.  . . Absinthe definitely raised the bar for me.  If you want a truly memorable entertainment experience in Las Vegas, you MUST go.  I've seen nothing like Absinthe and I can't wait to go again. A huge thanks to Rachel S. for the hookup!!
OMG! . One hell of a show. . If you are not a Puritan, you will laugh your ass off. . A pseudo cirque meets vaudeville meets HBO comedy special. . Some eye candy thrown in for good measure. . My friends & I had a blast. . A few of us actually peed our panties. It was that good. . Highly recommend.
I would have paid full price and then some for the potential of getting kicked in the face, teased into kissing a girl and having a balance beam fall on me. Is it wrong that I actually had more fun at Absinthe than at Cirque? Well, I'm just putting it out there. I did! And I'd go again, and again. . . Guys and gals will equally be tickled by the array of pecs, packages, pasties and primed abs. Oh come now, you know you wanna believe that that hot Eastern European acrobat is making eyes at you between the sets of acrobatic, comedic, burlesque. . . Others have mentioned how to get to the tent, but I'll just add, it's a minimum of 5 minutes in a full speed walk from Max Brenner at the other end of the Forum Shops to here. If you purchase your tickets from one of those ticket resellers, you still need to go to the box office 1 hour ahead of time to pick them up. And don't underestimate the line of people waiting to get in for general admission when the doors open 10 minutes before the performance starts. But don't worry, I don't think there's a bad seat in the house.... except maybe a few of the ones of the front row ones... unless you don't mind being roasted by the hosts and almost kicked in the face. We were there on a Saturday night, and at the tail end of the line, and still managed to snag seats in the middle of the action.. . Warning: Don't bring prudes. They say it right at the beginning, but someone who doesn't find sock puppets enacting sexual encounters, does not belong in this room.
I have been living in Las Vegas since I was 12 years old and I have seen just about every show on the strip. While my favorite continues to be The Love Show (due to my affinity for the Beatles), I nevertheless believe Absinthe is one of the best shows on the strip. At the very least, it is the most unique and diverse production to hit the strip in years.. . . Absinthe entails an intimate atmosphere. At first glance, it seems like a tiny circus tent that cost close to nothing to build and is not nearly as glamorous as other shows on the strip, especially not those in its price range. However, it surpasses them in character. It's not a normal show room. You will sit on small, folding chairs, view a small stage, watch strangely dressed actors and be reminded of a 1950's era saloon.. .  There is not a bad seat in the house. It has the acrobatics appeal of a cirq show and the comedy and live music of Danny Gans mixed with modern, amazing, youth-oriented comedy. Never fear though - it is not entirely anti-maturity...you just need to be able to laugh!  And WOW!!!! Adding any Circ show  with the comedic touch of seeing someone like Chelsea Handler perform stand-up....A+ in my book! . . I took my girlfriend here after we had an incredible dinner at Mastro's Ocean Club (another tremendous review to follow), and we absolutely loved it. f you don't enjoy loud humor and obnoxious comments paired with incredible acrobatics and stunts, this is not the show for you. However, if you love to laugh and se a unique take on the type of show every Vegas casino attempts to put on - this is the show for you. . . If you can afford it/feel like splurging, get the VIP tickets. VIP i's more money but you get early access/prime seating and a free drink (anything you want aside from Dom Perignon or however you spell it). They also have absinthe that Ih ear was very strong and very similar to the real . stuff. . . I am extremely picky (because I am spoiled due to the standards of Vegas) and I rarely write reviews. This is the first 5 star review I have ever posted and the first review I have written that has been longer than a paragraph or two. . . Trust me - go see it. . . See the show! If you don't like it, I will personally allow you to buy me more tickets. ;) . . Enjoy!!!!
Hoping this show will last and grow because the concept is so great. Crude to the point of "oh my gosh did they just say that" but haven't laughed that hard in a really long time. And the thrills - definitely had to cover my eyes during the one part because I was scared for them and couldn't believe it. Go - the action is so close and the laughs are so good!
Loved this show! The setting is so great; I've never been so close up to see everything like that. All of the acts are really good and the comedy part was hilarious. Don't go if you are easily offended:)
Fucking awesome!!!!   If you don't like my use of the word "fuck" this is the wrong fucking show for you!!!   Better than any of the Cirque show or any other show in Vegas.
Amazing show, though not for the easily offended (lots of swearing, crude jokes, etc.)  But I thought it was hilarious.  There is not a bad seat in the entire house.  You get to see the amazing Cirque Du Soleil-esque acts up close and personal.  Definitely go to this show!
Happy, fearful, and in complete awe are all the feelings I experienced with absinthe.  I wonder if the infamous European drink evokes the same emotions???. . There was comedy, sexuality, acrobats, and a tight-rope act; not exciting enough? Try having all of that - all up in your face!  Part of the appeal is the intimacy between the audience and the performers - makes for a laughable & terrifying show :). This show is not for kids, the faint of heart or people who can't laugh at themselves.. . We found great discounts at the up to 50%off ticket booths outside Bill's gambling hall & there's also one in excaliber.  Online general tickets sells for $78 but we got our tickets for $58.  Keep in mind there are no bad seats.  If you feel very adventurous sit in the front row for a memorable experience.  Let's just say I now know what a moose knuckle is...
Funny show, incredible feats of strength and acrobatics. If you don't want to be part of the show don't sit in the first row! Small venue makes this show even better. Some of the stuff was scary close ( I was in the first row). I got the VIP tickets and went early but it's not really necessary since there were plenty of seats. If you go there before the show they sell discounted tickets out front of the venue. Good bartenders and interesting drinks. See this show, it will surprise you...
Alright, clearly it is a 10 out of 10 show. HIGHlarious and breath-taking!!!!!. Here are helpful tips: The show is dark Mondays which also means their box office (the Absinthe box office located right behind Serendipity and right outside of hotel registration--don't let employees direct you to the Jerry Seinfeld Celine Dion Matt Goss box office no no no) is closed on Mondays. *The 9:30 shows are now changed to 10pm. Ahem, time for an update of your website....* That's ok because it afforded us time to go to the Munch Bar inside Caesars. We got seated at 9pm and lo and behold, the Pussy Cat Doll go-go dancer started to perform before our eyes so we got our fair share of entertainment if you know what I mean, great timing 9pm.. I recommend getting the VIP tickets because you get priority seating (it is a free for all, no assigned seating). The venue is a make shift tent so when I complained "why are their POLES blocking some people's views!" my husband replies "Um, hun, to hold up the tent." If you don't get VIP tickets, make sure you're there in advance to hold your place because a line forms so you can get a full view, I kind of had a partial view but the show is so entertaining it was worth the neck gymnastics I did. There's a bar serving drinks within the beer garden (carnival feel) so don't be dismayed at the wait.Also, when you're there you can play champagne-pong, and they have that shuffle board (?) game with the wood shavings and there are seats to sit down (limited). . During a high risk stunt, a fool in the front row started to snap pictures with flash. Staff immediately discouraged him, but still he could have disoriented the death-defying stuntman who was holding on to his partner for dear life. It took all of me not to give him a piece of my mind after the show. Please do not use flash (!!!!!), these performers make it look easy, but since the venue is so intimate you are able to see how complex and truly at risk they are at all times! For this reason, I'm glad I didn't sit in the very front row!!! . ENJOY! limited engagement so buy your tickets today. :0)
So glad we got to see this show on our last visit.  . . Just the right amount of comedy, sex, and acrobatic performance.  . . The stage itself is very small and since your in a circus tent everyone is crammed into this tight circle...not very comfortable...but, that is my only complaint.  . . The singing was good and the stunts were jaw dropping but the shocking raunchiness of the two hosts  was jaws to the knees hysterical...NOT FOR EVERYONE, HOWEVER.  My heart was nonstop racing...whether it was from the terrifying thought of being picked on by the ringleader..(FYI don't sit in the very front) or because I felt like my head would be decapitated by an incredible rollerskating act.. . The show was well worth the money.  Especially, since we bought our tickets last minute at tix for less.  The tent was packed though, so get yours soon in the day.  Also, the tent is in front of Caesars Palace and Tix 4 Less offers many discounts on dining nearby too.  So make a night out of it!  It won't disappoint.
Thank you yelp! We basically had plans almost every night while in Vegas but only one night open to go see a show. We saw so many advertised, but was not sure which one to go to. I started checking yelp for reviews and after reading every single one on this show, I knew we had to go. . . It was located in Caesar's Palace right outside where we stayed, perfect! We bought our tickets discounted at a great price. Outside as we waited in the line there was a bar outside. Absinthe, cocktails, beer, wine oh my they really knew how to make some fabulous drinks and the bartenders were awesome! . . So onto the show, you get squeezed in, no assigned seating, horrible very hard uncomfortable chairs where I was in between my hubby and brother in law and thought oh hell no this is NOT going to work. I was very uncomfortable. . . The show begins: The host was hysterical, I thought I was having a heart attack from laughing so hard. From the amazing stunts, the comedy, oh yes it is raunchy at it's best. In front of us sat an older couple who the look on their faces throughout the show was priceless. Like another reviewer stated, if you can not handle FUCK, DICK, SEX, BLOW JOBS, ETC....DO NOT COME! . . You see skin and lots of it, but both men and ladies. The entire staff are so talented. Yes, we all have seen stunts over and over again but they put such a twist on their routine's, it is simply amazing. Funny, sexy, sultry, pure shock with some stunts. This by far was so worth it and one of the best shows I have ever seen. Perfect two hour's of excitement! . . If you are looking for the best deal and the best show in Vegas, this is a MUST see! Trust me you will not regret it. Bring kleenex cause you will be crying from all the laughter, oh and maybe an ass pillow! . . It was truly such an incredible show that me being uncomfortable was not an issue. The pain was worth it. The two polish performers came out after the show and was so sweet to take pictures with us. HOTNESS! . . My favorite highlights: . The two polish guy's, the roller derby guy and lady, wow! The two hysterical host, lady in giant balloon, etc....really loved it all. . . Thank you for two hours of so much fun!
So glad I decided to see this show, which came highly recommended by local Vegas friends and Yelp! It was sexy, hysterical, stunning, and super entertaining!! I would definitely go back to see it! I can't really choose a favorite, the entire cast was stellar. Although the roller skating couple and the bodyguards did make my jaw drop.. . Come early to get your seats!
Thank you to everyone who has yelped about this show. I don't know if I would have noticed it without Yelp. . . This show was perfect. Great performers, funny acts, and not a bad seat in the place. . . Get there about 45mins early, grab a drink, and get in line. I don't think you have to buy vip to be happy. It's general admission, so you pick where you go. The front row will be messed with, so choose seating carefully.  Don't go if you can't handle dirty jokes. . . Seriously though, go. It's fantastic, and you will laugh so hard it hurts.
Imagine Cirque Du Soleil having a much younger, mentally deranged, vivacious brother.....that would be ABSINTHE. This show took my breath away!!! I even enjoyed It more than allot of the Cirque shows. The Gazillionaire did a great job at animating the crowd!
What a great show, an adult variety act.   If you're easily offended, this isn't the show for you.  But if you want something unique, funny, amazing, then see Absinthe. It's been noted that the seats aren't the most comfortable, but hey every seat pretty much has a great view.  I'd see it a second time without a doubt.
The best, most entertaining show you'll possibly ever see!  It's hilarious, rude, crude, and has incredible talent with gorgeous women and guys that will make you feel really shitty about yourself..    The best value of any show you will ever see as well, tix are only $70-$100 and you can even get them discounted at one of the tix for less places on the strip.  This show is worth twice as much, next time I'm in town I will definitely go check it out again. .    As other reviewers have said, If you're easily offended, this probably is not the show for you, but if that's the case, then Fuck You, you're a boring human being and need to enjoy life a little more.  I can't tell you enough good things, so just listen to me, and the rest of these assholes on here and check out the fucking show already!
Being a local we can be a little snooty when it comes to entertainment. I mean we live in the entertainment capitol of the world. Every once in a while I am still completely blown away. This show takes a step back in time and while keeping a current Las Vegas vibe to it. At times you are so close to the action you feel like you are in the show. All of the performers keep you on the edge of your seat and The Gazillionaire is insane. Penny is incredibly funny and fun to follow on twitter too @pennypibbets. Know this Absinthe I will be back for more. Oh I almost forgot, beer garden earns extra bonus points.
One of the best entertainment deals in Las Vegas!. . It is a burlesque cabaret circus, with comedy, variety acts, strip-tease, and astonishing acrobatics. . . I'm sure that "Absinthe" will draw comparisons to Cirque's "Zoomanity" - but this is far more intimate, much funnier, also far more risque. Send your conservative parents to Zoomanity; go with your cool friends to Absinthe.. . As with many circus shows, not every act is on at every performance. The acts that you see will depend on the night you go.  In my mind this makes "Absinthe" worth a return visit or five.. . [NERD WARNING] - "Absinthe" is performed inside of an authentic  restored "Spiegeltent" (look it up on Wikipedia).  Anyone with an interest in performing arts history should go if for no other reason than to experience the beautiful structure from the inside. It is a work of art unto itself, and worth seeing.. . If you are offended by (very!) sexually explicit language, you should probably see another show. Otherwise, don't miss it.
So awesome! Not for kids or the faint of heart, but a raucous, creative and outrageous evening. Hard to describe, but IMHO a cross between Cirque, Teatro Zinzanni, and an old fashioned freak show. We laughed so hard that it hurt. Definitely recommend it!
When it comes to Vegas shows, you definitely have your choice of seeing ones that will ultimately leave you in your seats with an awe-struck look. BUT, do you just want to see talent, or do you want to have a little bit of everything? . . Absinthe is probably the BEST show I've been to in Vegas...well, quite possibly ever! But I warn you, it's raw. You've got raw comedy which will have you laughing histerically and shaking your head at the same time. And if you're easily offended, this probably isn't the show for you. And if you're looking to become a part of the act, sit in the front row. :) They definitely have crowd involvement. . . But it doesn't just stop at the raw comedy. You have acrobatics varying from dancing with a hint of strip-tease, flipping, tight rope walking, roller skating and physical displays of strength. Everything you would see in a cirque show but better. . . Everyone in our group loved it and our age range was between 25-45. Granted, we all have a great sense of humor and mostly laugh at those who are just uptight, but honestly, if you aren't laughing and having a blast at this show, there is probably something seriously wrong wtih you...and you should lighten up, grab a drink and just relaxand enjoy life. . . I'm still amazed at how great the show was...you won't be disappointed!
This show is hilarious!  They don't have preferred seating but the area is not that big that you can easily see the show.  This is definitely a show for mature audience.  Expect a lot of nudity, profanity and swearing.  But other than that it was fun.
I absolutely loved this show! Very possibly the best Vegas show I have ever seen! We had VIP tickets and I can say they were worth it considering the seating is gen admission and u would have had to get their early to get a good seat. The comedy was dead on and raunchy and sexy. I wouldn't bring a kid here but All adults should make it a point to see this show! Worth every penny and can't wait to c it again!
Like everyone else I loved this. Especially the roller skaters!
I am still thinking of this show.. This is hands down the best show in Las Vegas.. One word...Rollerskates.. Yes it is vulgar and offensive.. Don't bring your 9 year old to it.. There are actual moments of tension and fear of the stunts being performed 10 feet in front of you..The music is great, the host is hilarious, and the acts are absolutely amazing..
Went to Vegas and did the obligatory Cirque Shows. (O and Love) Now it was Saturday night and wanted something based from Quebec. I wanted something American, something dirty raunch and something with titties. I was going to go to Penn and Teller, though no titties. So I took a chance on Absinthe. Based on the reviews here I saw it. MY WIFE AND I LOVED IT. Great characters. The Gazillionaire and Penny... PENNY!!! The Green Fairy. Sexy (non surgical enhanced boobies) and a fantastic voice! Angel Parrino. Schwing! Just a great intimate circus show with great performers. I hope they take it on tour to Miami. I will definitely go. As should you.
If you can only see one show while in Las Vegas, see Absinthe while you can.    This is seriously one of the best and coolest shows we have ever seen and the small venue makes for a very unique and personal experience.  The acts are fabulously talented and the host is hysterically obscene.  This show is pure Vegas and needs to be seen by everyone.. . However, like previous posters have said, if you're easily offended you may want to skip this one.  There was a multitude of jaw-droppingly offensive things said, but all in the name of humor and shock.  Worth it, if you ask us.
Best date show for young and fun loving couples. We couldn't stop laughing the entire show. Their acrobatics rivaled anything we have seen at cirque shows. And we loved the striptease and burlesque style.... it made u feel like u were in Vegas. We had a great time! Highly recommend!
Hilarious, This show was so much better than the other shows we have seen. It is a lot of the same acrobatic acts seen in the Cirque shows but presented in a totally different manner. Penny ( the assistant MC) was awesome. . . We will be coming back to this show and bringing our friends.
Three words: full-frontal male nudity!. . Okay, so it's not exactly total full-frontal, but I certainly got an eyeful.  We got the $20 locals discount and then opted for the VIP ticket which allowed us to forego standing in line for the first come first served seating. Instead we got access to the VIP lounge which was full of awesome hanging chairs and nooks to enjoy a drink in.  Worth the money for sure!. . They let the VIP ticket holders in before the common folk and we got front row seats with a tiny table which was awesome because it was so close to the action and was conducive to drinking while enjoying the show.  The only other tables were booths in the last row, which are probably still good seats since the venue is so small, but being in the front row was incredible.  If any of the stunts had gone wrong we would have been hit by an errant rollerskate or tightrope walker, which only added to the excitement.. . If you have a filthy mind and a raunchy sense of humor, this is definitely the show for you.
Absinthe combines adult comedy with spectacular acrobatics.  If you are easily offended by bad words and sexual themes, you might want a different show.  If not, the comedy is very, very good.  The acrobatics are astonishing.  I had no idea that what they did was even possible.  Right up there with the cirque acts and, in a few cases, even more impressive.  The show is fast paced each act brings something new.  I would very highly recommend this.  Sitting close to the front is nice, but the tent is quite small so most seats are good.  We found some $20 off coupons earlier in the day, so the tickets cost $50.
God this show was hilarious. Mind blowing and shocking as well. Simply amazing, I could not stop laughing. Penny was HILARIOUS!! I would definitely watch again!
Hands down one of the most entertaining shows I've seen.  A little raunchy a LOT exciting.  I was laughing, crying and gasping for air.  Penny and the Gazillionaire (i think was what she introduced him as)  had amazing chemistry and I was in tears laughing so hard at their banter.  The performers were so skilled and so impressive.  The intimate setting just adds to the magic of the show.  I would see this again and again and would DEFINITELY recommend to friends. Thanks for a great night guys!
I'm not gonna lie.... . My husband and I bought the tickets for this show, because they were cheap, and because we already knew that we would be at Caesar's Palace.  However, a great show + liquor + genitalia make quite an awesome combination!. . The show is held in a close and intimate circus tent filled with mirrors.  No seat can be considered to be a "bad" seat.  If you sit in the front, you may be subjected to insults, skate-related bruises, or boobies in your face.  That's generally a normal Saturday night in my life, but alas.... . If you suffer from a Puritanical streak, you will be offended.  If not by the boobies and abundance of one-eyed willies, then by the saucy genitalia jokes made by the two hosts.  'Tis not a show for your gramps and grandma unless they are pervs.... . You however will truly enjoy the stunts that you will see, completely up close and personal.  Everything from neck-spinning on roller skates, handstands on bald man-heads and naked tap dancing in a semi-permeable bubble.  . . Seriously, what more do you need to be entertained?
Glorious. Believe the hype. . . It's Raunchy humor, amazing circus acts and some moderate pseudo-nudity; but it is more than the sum of it's parts, and I don't just mean those parts. It takes place in a tiny tent and if something goes wrong someone in the audience is gonna get hurt pretty bad because it's all three inches from the front row (and often the aisles and second and third row as well.) This is really all you need to know.. . Tips: Guy in front of the tent giving out 20 bucks off coupons. Awesome. Also apparently a locals discount of 20 bucks off. Excellent. Beer = $12 bucks! Boo. But it's Chimay! Well done. . . I've read not to spring for the VIP seats, but I would argue as someone who didn't and got to the front of the regular queue, that they're probably worth it. This is one of the best and most intimate shows I've ever seen, and you'll only see it *new* once. Pay extra, you'll get close enough to the point they'll probably sweat on you. That came out a little gross. It's still awesome.. . I would recommend this to everyone I know over every other show provided they can stand glorious filthy humor.
Not a bad seat in the place.  Hilarious, yet acrobatic impossible acts that will make your mouth drop.. . You will leave there laughing forsure!!
***MUST SEE***Great show for the location, price, arena. Small arena so every seat is good. Crazy acts (don't try at home), host is funny, vulgar, picks on the crowd. Like a cirque Du sol but half the price. Sitting front row may be dangerous to your health or and ego.
This show was awesome! My favorite part was the rollerskaters. The comedy was great, of course :) the seats suck, they're little wooden chairs-my only complaint.. . Tip: don't pay full price, there are guys outside the beer garden areas giving $20 coupons-also locals get $20 off too-so for $49-an awesome show!
Forgive me for taking 4 months to get my review written.  I am perpetually behind on Yelping!. . Looks like my procrastinating didn't matter a whit here since the reviews are fabu.  My husband and I LOVED this show.  Sexy andbawdy, definitely not for the kids.  Half was a comedy show, the other half was closer to Cirque acts but MUCH MUCH MUCH more intimate.  General admission seating was no issue even though we were toward the back of the line.  My husband loves absinthe(the drink) and was happy he could order it here.. . We thought both different sides were fantastic...the comedy and physical stuff...and couldn't decide which was better.. . We got tickets at the discount storefront and saved a bundle.. . If you're a prude, maybe you should skip this one.  If not, GO!
I've seen Absinthe twice - both times it was highly entertaining and highly hilarious!  General admission tickets gets you a supremely close seat to the action, regardless of what row you end up in.  The closer you sit, the more likely you are to end up harassed by The Gazillionaire or with a wine glass full of Melody Sweets glitter bomb (I speak from experience).. . The entire show is a mash up variety show that will keep you laughing and engaged.  My favorite part was the crazy roller skating couple - I fear for that girl's life!. . It was raunchy and rowdy and inappropriate and geared for adults...so naturally I loved every minute of it.  That Penny is a f-ing riot!
What an amazing show!  We checked it out last night and were not disappointed at all.  It was a great mix of comedy and pure entertainment.  I would totally go see this show again...it was that good!  Beware...if you are easily offended, this is not the show for you though!
This was a great show. I got tix at at local tix4tonight booth for $120.00 for a pair and it was well worth it. I ended up in the 2nd row as close as you want to get trust me. The jokes are crude but funny as all hell. The performers were great and the show was long which is good. The seating is tight, as I had a heavy gal next to me that her legs were touching mine and she was all wierd about it. The wood chairs are wire tied together so moving them farther apart won't happen. All in all this is a must see show best show Iv'e seen for the money in vegas.
The best show EVER!!!!
Great show, and inexpensive compared to other shows- $20 off out front by the box office from guys handing out coupons. Sorta a variety of different acts- comedy, burlesque, and other stuff that is hard to define. Really raunchy- hilarious, come with a sense of humor!
Effing HILARIOUS!!!! Totally raunchy and did I mention HILARIOUS!! Need I say more??
Absinthe rocks out with their... codpieces out. Seriously, this combination of close-up acrobatics, bizarre theatrics, and blue comedy is damned entertaining. Just don't sit in plain view of the Gazillionaire.
AMAZING! Absinthe absolutely blew me away and I can not recommend it highly it enough. Superb value for money, excellent entertainment, . incredible performers...and everything is performed so so close to you! . . This is absolutely a must-see show in my opinion and I would see it again in a heartbeat. Think adult circus (tightrope walkers, skaters, cabaret, burlesque, crazy balancing acts) but with a wicked vegas twist. . . For a few extra dollars you can get VIP tickets. I highly recommend this for the following reasons:. . 1) You get to skip the line and enter a VIP only bar through a "secret" green telephone booth. It's whacky and silly...but fun and worth every penny. . . 2) Once invite the VIP bar, you will get a free drink (they have absinthe cocktails and the bar man is a really nice guy).. . 3) VIP ticket holders enter the main tent first and get first pick of the seating. This means you can sit in the FRONT row and have all of the performers super close. It's mind blowing. Yes, there is also a strong chance that you will be made fun of by the Gazillionaire or asked to participate in the show....but that just makes the experience 10x funnier and better, trust me, you won't regret it :). . 4) I'm going to say it again....FRONT ROW! You will have allof the performers doing their incredible performances so close that you could reach out and touch them (in one case, I did!). . Also, unlike most shows - Absinthe allows (non-flash) photography and videos! Awesome.. . TIP: If you buy tickets from one of the guys outside of Caesars (they walk around with a Absinthe sandwich board advert) then you will get $20 off the show too. At least, that offer was valid in August 2011.
this show was so awesome!!. . the kid in front of me on his 21st birthday left the show to puke after 10 minutes so i had an awesome view. thanks dude. . . don't be mad when the bazillionaire calls you out for being a boring white person, or a black lesbian or makes you choose which of your friends is the most slutty. all the stunts were so risky and you are so up close to the action. i was entertained literally the entire time.. . loved it.
Wow! Jew jokes, titties, amazing skill, and a venue that is better than any I've ever stepped foot it; what's not to like?. . When I wasn't gasping in sheer awe (and I'm not one to gasp easily), or staring up at the ceiling as a beautiful topless (save for sparkly pasties) blonde slid down on a rope, or laughing my ass off as the emcee picked on old people, gays, the black dude in an Affliction shirt, or the Asian that was bad at math, I was sipping on my drink and admiring the fact that I was less than 10 feet away from these amazing performers.  Tickets are cheap ($69 or $99, but there's usually a dude walking around near the venue with $20 off coupons) and it's all GA seating, so be sure and get there early.  Cute cocktail broads wander the beer garden while you wait, serving up reasonably potent drinks for a Hamilton.  After you enter the tent, you're shown to the next available seats for your size party and then the magic starts.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
be sure you put your PC sensors away.  The show is irreverent and crude.  But if you go in understanding and accepting that, it's a fun show.  The acrobatics & skills are great.. . If you sit in the front row, you may get picked on.  One of the better seats may be a few rows back where the seats are on risers, so the angle is better.. . beware of the audience participation.  Don't go up unless you're pretty uninhibited...
This show was awesome!! Funny and exciting. I've seen lots of cirque shows in Vegas and love them for the artistry and beauty but this show was fantastic in a completely different way. If you can't decide...just go!! As others have said though it is dirty. If you are offended by nudity, crude or racist humor go see O. If you can handle crude sexual humor go see Absinthe. You won't regret it. The drinks are great too!!
I loved it!  Totally raunchy and hilarious.  The stunts and acrobats were pretty amazing, but watching them done 10 ft from your face gave it an incredible perspective.  The humor will have you rolling on the floor.  Don't sit in the front row unless you want to be a part of the show and made fun of.  Hurry and see it, I heard it is gone at the end of the month!
Best Show I've ever seen.  Seriously, it's hysterical!  It is ADULT HUMOR though so keep that in mind and it's definitely on the raunchy side.  It's a tiny venue so make plans in advance. Also, we did the VIP tix thing and it was pretty sweet!  Way better than Zumanity!!!
One of the best shows I've seen in Vegas!! Loved the cross between racial barriers with jokes about whites, blacks n Asians alike! Would recommend watching this show while in Vegas!
The antithesis to the dime-a-dozen Cirque du Soleil productions.  Part burlesque, part retro circus, part vaudeville.  This show has it all!  Note to the wise:  Those that can't laugh at themselves, claim to have never farted in public or touched themselves in private and are offended by vulgarities and sexual deviance...DO COME!!  This is a perfect opportunity for that crap to be beaten out of you (and rightfully so). . . Perhaps the best original show sans the pretentiousness and manufactured mystery that has become all the rage.  What Cirque du Soleil sacrificed to appeal to the masses and worldwide fame, Absinthe has regurgitated into a phoenix of reinvention that is all together more intimate and visceral.  Not to be missed!. . #Yelp:  043/365
This show lives up to it's reviews!!  It was definitely crude, but so hilarious and the acts were highly entertaining! I laughed a lot and was continually impressed. A must see in Vegas
Hard to describe but hilarious and tons of fun. Liked everything about it.  Show up early and get in line if you want to get your choice of seats, seating is first come first served general admission. If you sit up front, you might become part of the show. Easily the best show we saw in Vegas, hands down. A must see
A month and a half later I am still thinking about this show almost every day. The best show I've ever seen in Vegas. . . I had no expectations for this show, my girlfriend took me for my birthday as a surprise. I went in a complete wet blanket. Wow. Shock value, intimacy, and incredible athletic performances that exceed any other show.. . The host and co-host were over the top, and the humor was VERY adult. I'm talking the Russell Brand lookalike host sticking his tongue down a non receptive older male audience members throat. Don't sit in the front row unless you're comfortable with this being you.. . The comedy element was all about audience participation and it was great... because I was not a part of it.. . The venue is a small big top carnival type deal, air-conditioned but outdoors. There are a ton of Cirque du Soleil type performances that were done within a few feet of audience members. I guess they have good insurance because if anything goes wrong, there could be some serious damage done to audience members.. . Go see it! Best show in Vegas! Only if you aren't a prude though!
This is hands down one of the most entertaining and amazing shows I've seen. . . Let's start with the theater, which is super tiny and in-the-round, so you can see well from wherever you are.  You are also quite literally in the path of the performers. An intimate feeling and a definite plus.. . Now for the show: interesting acts that I've never seen or heard of before (hello rollerskating acrobats....although I've heard that couple has recently moved to another show). The tight rope act is titillating. I think I held my breath the entire time they were up there.. . Host: a little raunchy at times.  I mean how many times do you really have to say the F-word? It starts to lose it's luster after the, oh, 50th time.. . Pretty amazing and pretty great show.
I'll admit straight away that I do not have the most experience with Vegas shows. Some, but not a hell of a lot.. . That said, if you have a chance to go see *this* show and don't immediately jump on it, we are no longer friends.. . We saw Absinthe as a farewell to Las Vegas after a week of work. It's hilariously funny (read: really fucking dirty, leave the kids home) and visually stunning. I know you're wondering so I'll just lay it on you: yes, there are tits.. . I'm trying to not go into too much detail here because you really need to see it first hand but, it's a bit of comedy, bit of acrobatics, bit of burlesque and WELL WORTH THE MONEY. Teller (of a little group you may have heard of starting with Penn) was sitting 2 rows in front of me and then stuck around after the show to play with the acrobats. Nuff said?
They are currently no longer performing in Las Vegas, but they will be coming back to town in the future.  I work in the entertainment business in Las Vegas and have seen many of the shows available.  Honestly, this one is the most impressive I've ever seen.  The intimate venue combined with truly breathtaking acrobatic performances made for a truly great show.. . For those who have seen the show, the rollerskating duo is no longer with Absinthe and can be seen here soon at the V theater.
Absinthe returns to Caesars Palace October 21st  :) . . GO IT'S AMAZING!!
I've seen several shows in Vegas and although this doesn't have the grandeur of watching a multi-million dollar spectacle like O or Ka, you will leave amazed by the acrobatics.  Plus, your stomach will be sore the next day from laughing so much.. . I can honestly say I haven't had this much fun at a show in a LONG time.  The mixture of crazy acrobatics with raunchy, offensive humor makes this a must see show!  . . My better half and I went during the Labor Day weekend so yes, this review is a bit late, but I seriously remember this show like it was just yesterday.  I wanted to see something different during our Vegas trip and not another $150/ticket Cirque show.  I read the reviews for Absinthe, which were all fantastic, and the price was VERY reasonable.  We got a couple of the VIP tickets which was great and all, but really not that necessary.  The theater is pretty small so you will get a good seat regardless of where you sit, but if you want to feel important then pay the extra $20 for VIP.  You'll need to say some pretty humiliating things to enter the VIP area but once you're there, you can hang out in the lounge and order up some adult beverages.  You'll also gain access to the theater earlier so you can sit up close and personal.. . Once you're inside, you become immersed in the world of Absinthe!  You'll be in awe of some of the acts, and you'll laugh so hard at some of the highly inappropriate jokes.  You'll see a little bit of boobage and you'll fall in love with the host and co-host, but not in a Care Bears endearing way.  Their sense of humor will have you laughing like a hyena.  . . The show was so good that my better half wanted to take her girlfriends a few weeks later (they were coming to Vegas for a bachelorette party).  Unfortunately, the show took a bit of a hiatus during that time but it will be back very soon.. . Look out for coupons and save yourself a few bucks, but even if you don't land any, just pay the regular price... it's worth it.  They say laughter is good medicine and I was cured of all my ailments after leaving that show!
Dirty, bawdy, fun.  I got the VIP tickets, but would say it wasn't worth it.  You end up sitting in "special seats" along the back wall.  I think it would have been a bit more fun a little closer, but I did get to sit in a barber's, go through the secret entrance and received a free drink.. . I got my ticket on Vegas.com but on a Tuesday night the theater was half empty and they were giving out coupons for the show.  Had I known, I would have waited to get my tickets.. . The show itself isn't as grand as the Cirque shows, but it is highly entertaining.  It's all about the comedy.  Las Vegas is a liberal town, so there are quite a few jokes about the left.  Don't go if you are easily offended or have soft sensibilities, this isn't the show for you.. . I've seen quite a few shows in Vegas and this is one I would go see again.  I was by myself and had a great time.
Yes, it's as awesome as the other reviews indicate.. . Got tickets at the little ticket booth near Serendipity. The guy handing out discount cards was nearby wearing a white blazer. Discount does not apply to the VIP tickets.. . Went on a Sunday night at the 10pm showing, and it wasn't crowded at all. We opted for the more comfy cushioned seats toward the back. Didn't really impact our view, since the tent is relatively small. However, a good portion of the action does face one way (towards the entrance of the tent). Had an Absinthe cocktail for $12, just for kicks. They were generous with the alcohol. Acrobatics are cool. Rollerskaters are no longer with the show. The raunchy comedy portions was hilarious, though I could understand that it's not for everyone (i.e. I would not recommend to my parents). Cameras (w/o flash) and video is allowed.
I've seen several vegas shows and this one was probably my favorite! The acts were amazing and very entertaining to watch. Although the roller skate act made me a little nervous, it also made my jaw drop in awe! I went with three others and we all couldn't stop talking about the show after we left! Very vulgar but we thought it was hilarious. Definitely worth the $ in terms of entertainment and value.
Absinthe is a welcome change of pace from current show offerings here in Las Vegas.. . The theater in the round format reminds me of the original traveling Cirque du Soleil show in the smaller venue. . . The performances I am assuming change based on the pictures posted here and what I saw last night.  All the acts were very impressive to see in such a small venue and up so close.  The rope dancer was probably the most impressive performance and what a great costume she had to accentuate her amazing figure. And like the other reviews have said, be prepared for Sarah Silverman type humor.. . The 100 year old tent the show was in earlier this summer has been replace with a more permanent type soft structure/tent, which is probably safer rigging wise as well as better suited to the high winds we have here in the winter.. . There is no beer garden for this tour probably because of the cool temperatures. Luckily I opted out of purchasing the VIP ticket since all it includes now is early entry into the venue and a drink. The drinks are reasonably price so the VIP ticket price is not saving you much and if you are there when they open the doors (45 min before show time) you will have your pick of seats. The is a promotion code for locals you can use when purchasing through Ticketmaster.. . Make sure you do trythe house drink offered by the waitresses. It is very tasty and strong.
-Super funny. There is swearing and graphic humor. Amazing acts.. - Get $20 bucks off with the handout ( look for dude with white suit and gold shoes). -They call people out who sit in the front rows. . -The main gates open at 7 pm where there's an outside bar with Vegas prices (theres a bar inside too.) . -Try to be in line by 730 for the main door opening.. - Get seats with tables or cushions in the back. - waitress come round before and in the middle of the show for drinks or small snacks (only to the people seating along the rim of the tent). -don't sit behind tent pole. -you can take pics but no flash. . - the tent is warm, no need for layers inside.
All of the amazing hype is true. Seriously. If you like comedy, burlesque, amazing acrobatics, and ridiculousness, just do yourself a favor and go see this show. There is no longer a beer garden or any cool carnival stuff outside (sadface) but the inside of the Spiegeltent is killer cool, with all sorts of weird things to sit in/on (bathtub couches!), and every seat has an amazing view. Penny is hilariously dirty (the unicorn story is the best). The bartenders make nice strong drinks.. . If you're sick of paying out the ass for Cirque shows and you want something completely different and really fun, this is the show for you.
Fantastic show!  I loved that the show was in a circus tent rather than a theater, which provided for a much more intimate environment.  All of the performers were top notch.  They even had Duvel on tap!  That was the icing on the cake!
A variety act that is parody of vaudeville with acrobatics on a tiny stage. To break it up they have raunchy comedy that made me laugh my butt off. What makes this show so good is how intimate it is. There isn't a seat in the small tent that isn't a perfect spot. You see the sweat coming from the gymnast, you will be scared that the insane roller skater couple might fly onto your lap. A lot of muscle ripped men with their shirt off if you are in to that. Best show I've seen on the strip by far.
Have you ever fallen asleep at a show?  I have, and I for sure thought I'd be catching some zeees again when I recently went to see Absinthe in Vegas, only because I was sleep deprived and it was at 10pm on a weeknight.. . But alas, the magic elves or air-conditioning or something kept me up... I stayed awake for Absinthe and loved every raunchy moment!. . This acro-cabaret variety show is definitely not for the faint of heart... it has everything from dirty jokes, horrible language, crazy acrobats, almost-naked dancers, comedy, and more.  They also incorporate the audience quite a bit.  Your mouth may drop open and I guarantee you will laugh out loud at this show.  For those that know my husband, it's totally his sense of humor on steroids.  Think of anything inappropriate you've ever heard, and it's in this show.. . The tent it takes place in is intimate -- I would say there's not a bad seat in the house, but there kind of was a bad seat: mine!  I sat on a horribly uncomfortable bench.  Nonetheless, I stayed awake, loved the show, and would recommend it to anyone that has half a sense of humor.  If you're going to be in Vegas anytime soon, I highly recommend this show. Enjoy!
On a somewhat spur of the moment last night, we went with some friends to see Absinthe at Caesars Palace. They had seen it, highly recommended it and wanted to see it again with us. . . So here is my review. If you are offended by dirty talk and the 'F'-word, then you shouldn't go to see this show. If near topless women make you turn your head in disgust, avoid this show at all costs.  If you are turned off by references to someone's sexual preference, political leanings or the occasional religious taunt, then you might want to skip this one. . . If the sight of handpuppets engaged in graphic sexual performances while a beautiful redhead gives you a blow by blow (pardon the reference, if you're offended) description, then this show will definitely upset you.. . If you fall into any of the above categories, the please, GET THERAPY. If you don't and you do love to laugh until tears come, then definitely don't wait another minute to see this show. It's the funniest effing show in Las Vegas, and probably anywhere else. The acrobatics are wonderful, the ladies attractive and the men dressed up as ladies....well, that's another story. But, this is truly a marvelous show not to be missed by anyone in Vegas who enjoys being entertained and isn't afraid to blush with embarrassment or shock. This is not your grandma's 'Cirque'.
Bawdy, vulgar and highly entertaining. There really isn't much I can say about this show that hasn't already been said. . . I have been twice now and I have to say it gets better and better. It is a very intimate stage setting. There are comical wire walkers, seductive trapeze and acrobatics artists, and a host and hostess who are shockingly vulgar and funny. The seating is first come, first serve so it's good to arrive early to get a primo seat. But honestly, there are no bad seats in this tent. . . Definitely worth the price of admission and I believe they offer discounted seats to locals, so definitely make this show a priority.
One part burlesque, one part comedy act and one part circus sideshow, Absinthe should NOT be missed by anyone. Talked our friends out of catching any of the 20 Cirque shows on the strip to watch this with us, and not a single one walked away disappointed. Rowdy, raunchy, and hilarious.
Go now. Go to Vegas to see the show. Every thing is true and then some. Wish it would have gone on for another 2 or 3 hours. Listen to the directions you are given when you first walk in and you can possibly get a nice comfy seat and there is no bad view in the place. The stage does raise so you have better view towards the back. Yes it can be offensive to some people as they say at the begining of the show understand we are talking no limits of humor here so do not think you are immune if you are truly not immune. One of the biggest highlights of my trip to Vegas.
I had no Idea what to expect going into this show. I knew it had a little bit of a cirque feel to it, but honestly I wasn't even sure if it was a cirque show...I knew there was some comedy to it, but wasn't sure what the basis was other than the name Absinthe.. . I feel sorry for anyone who went into this show knowing what to expect. I almost feel guilty writing this review right now, because it robs you of the complete and utter surprise of sitting down and 5 minutes in realizing you have just walked into the raunchiest x-rated cirque show imaginable. . . WARNING: seriously....everyone else has said it, but they really hold nothing back in this show.. . We arrived late but the seating in the tent outside Caesar's is circular so even though we sat in the back, our seats were still great. The seating is general admission so it's basically first come first serve. BUT...if you are the type of person who doesn't mind being embarrassed or used during the show, then by all means show up early and sit in the front row...you WILL, however be subjected to whatever racist, sexist,  or prejudice tirade the host of the show feels like labeling you with.. In other words....If you are sensitive, sit in the back.. We weren't aware of this, but we sat in the back anyway because they have these cool little booths in the back with tables, and because it's a smaller venue it makes the show more intimate.. There is a bar set up before you enter, but don't feel the need to load up there before you go in because there are also bars inside, which sell drinks throughout the show. As well there are servers walking around the back isle offering drinks if you can flag one down.. I dropped $30 on two mixed drinks and a glass of wine...but well worth it, because they are pouring them tall and strong.. . The show is a mix of Sketch comedy, improv, cirque acts, and burlesque, but it's worth it just to see the look on the faces of the 60 year old tourists in the front row as the host "the gazillionaire" shoves his crotch in their face & really steals the show, with an act reminiscent of Tony Clifton as played by Andy Kaufman.. I can't really comment on the price of the show, as I got the ticket for free. But having seen it now I would certainly go back with the right people and gladly pay.. . As others have said...if you go...don't take your mom, unless your mom happens to be seriously disturbed.
My wife and I saw this show last week 12/13.. . I started planning our Vegas trip back in May and once I booked my flights, my next step was to look for a show for us to check out. We have not been to too many Vegas shows and we were just looking for something different. I could not tell you how many reviews I have read of this show and other shows. . . We ended up going to a 7pm show and we got our tickets at will call which is right outside the venue. You can even bring your own drinks in. They do have a place right outside the doors that you can purchase some drinks as well. When you walk in and go to the left there was a bar there that did sell the Absinthe drink. My wife tried it and it tasted like black licorice. It was soo strong at first she had to add sprite and ice and made into a mixed drink. Even with it cut it was still pretty strong. I tried some and I even have to take a swig of my beer. I mean it was cool to try, since you are at the "Absinthe" show. The Absinthe drink was $12 and the bottled beer I had was $7. The Absinthe drink is really the size of 2 shots, but if you add the ice and sprite it should last you the entire show if you sip it and relax. All the bartenders were really cool and remembered what you ordered if you return. The stage is really a small circle and yes, we got there early enough to sit right down front, but due to my wife's back issues we chose to sit in the back section where they had a mogpog of places to sit. Our section was the very first seats if you walk in and go to the right. If you sit there it was cool because you can also see all the next performers get ready (warm up) to come to the stage. Our section had a old school bench and we also had a few stools and a small table for our drinks. The section right next too us had 2 rocking chairs and a table. So each little section is a little different. There was a waitress that did come a round once the show started in case you were wondering. Even if you sit in the back were we did, or all the way in the front, there is no bad seat since this venue is small.. . This was an amazing show. We loved every act that came out including the Gazillionaire and my favorite was Penny his assistant. She was really funny. Not to give too much away:. The opening act was my second favorite act. What the bodyguards did was my favorite. Angel Porrino did one act and it was funny. The singer Melody Sweets did a few numbers and she was really really good. I laughed the most when Penny did her introduction of an act. Again, everything was great. . . They do offer a stand at the entrance were you can buy merch. I got a shirt, but they also had hats, mugs and female shirts. The only thing I wish they did was to do a meet and greet at the end. It would have been cool to get a few autographs to add to my collection, but I will not take away any stars for that. Since we go to Vegas once a year, if this show is still running and they mix things up in the show I would have no problem going to the show again.
just read the other reviews :)
At the risk of sounding like an ad for an Adam Sandler movie where they interview audiences outside of the theater, I have to say that my face hurt from laughing so much after this show. I'm not what you'd call "easily offended." I'm a pretty thick-skinned gal and I'm not averse to foul language or nudity, but wow, I was even surprised by the amazingly offensive hilarity at this show. . . You know how most cirque-type shows have the acrobat act followed by the clown act. And the clown act is some foofy French shit that is mildly humorous at best, and mostly evokes an, "Aww, that's cute." Well, the "clown" act in Absinthe is totally different. The hosts are absolutely hilarious, and while I know a lot of it is scripted, they are on point with their improv too. . . The acrobat acts were 80% fantastic too, there was one that was whatevs, but just wait for the tightrope walkers. Thanks to the super intimate venue, you get to see tightrope walkers closer than you ever have before. It's pretty spectacular. . . Absinthe is my number one recommendation for Vegas these days. I'm not much into clubs, and I'd be more into shows if they didn't all run more per ticket than my car payment. But Absinthe, oh Absinthe. It's a must-see. And for the price (especially with the plentiful discounts around town), it can't be beat.. . PS It's true. Be careful about sitting in the front row, you will more than definitely get teased. It's pretty hilarious, but if you're still recovering from Little Tommy teasing you in 4th grade for having hairy legs, well, maybe sit a few rows back.
great show.  definately recommend to anyone with a great sense of humor and no inhibitions.
No expectations.. just go see the show.
OMG! Hilarious, entertaining, unexpected, fun, bawdy... I could go on and on with the adjectives. It's basically everything you want from a Vegas show - it's got it all.. . The actual space itself for the show is amazing. It's in a heated tent outside of Caesars. Once you walk in, though, you have no idea you are in a giant, white tent. You can easily entertain yourself just sitting in your chair (it's general admission seating, by the way) and looking around at everything. Lots of intricate, little details. And if you are lucky enough to get to go through the VIP entrance, the entrance is actually a neon green phone booth. It took me a minute to grasp that the inside wall of the booth was a door.. . The show itself is, well... Lots and lots and lots of adjectives. And none of those adjectives can do it justice. Just go see this show, ok? There's a lot of humor. There's a lot of duo acts (including roller skates!). There's some nudity. There's some singing. It's like what a Cirque show would've been like back during the high days of the carnival. . . When I first heard it was 90 mins, I wanted to cringe. I can barely sit through anything for 90 mins. In fact, applaud the Vegas shows that are under 90 mins. However, with Absinthe, I easily could've sat through another 90 mins. And if you know me at all, THAT is really saying something.. . Easily one of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas!
One of the best shows in Vegas, but beware that it's REALLY not for everybody (especially not kids) -several people walked out in disgust after the host/hostess started their bits. It was hilarious but extremely raunchy and dragged on a bit too long imho - I would never bring my mom to see this. They also heckle the front rows re: being old, gay, drunk sluts, middle eastern terrorists. You've been warned. . . I loved this show because it's fun, but also because it's rare to see amazing acrobatics in such a close intimate setting. I also like that they didn't really bother with a lame story. Cirque shows tend to be kind of like softcore porn - you have to sit thru a lot of half ass plot between the cool scenes, but in this case you can't fast forward. Absinthe was like hardcore porn - they just got to the good stuff. I go to Cirque type shows for the cool acrobatics and that's exactly what absinthe delivers.. . There wasn't any actual nudity as other reviews mentioned, just hot girls down to a thong and pasties. Lots of hot shirtless guys and a couple not so hot ones in speedos too. . . Totally worth seeing. My only complaint is that the wooden folding seats are ridiculously uncomfortable even w my personal padding. I get that they're going for the circus atmosphere but least add a cushion. Even those aluminum bleachers circuses usually have would've been better because then it would have stadium seating. . . Be sure to go early for a good seat. My friend didn't mention it was general admission so we showed up right before start and got stuck in the back. I'm 5'3 so couldn't see around the people in front of me sometimes. But there are only 9-10 rows so its not bad.
I have seen Siegfried & Roy, Penn & Teller, Ka, O, Mystere, Carrot Top, Lance Burton, Amazing Jonathan, Ice, Steve Wyrick, Jubilee, Crazy Horse, etc. and, without hyperbole, Absinthe may be better than them all for the following reasons:. . 1) Intimate setting. Show starts at 9:30pm, we arrive in line at 8:50pm, and we get second row seats a few feet from the very small stage in a very small tent. There are no bad seats in the tent. Even third or fourth row seats at Absinthe are closer to the action than first row seats at any other show.. . 2) The show is R-rated (some would say X-rated). Almost all the shows in Vegas are G-rated - even Penn & Teller eliminate the R-rated content from their Showtime show and other media (movies and books) in order to fill their theatre at the Rio. So all the other shows have to appeal to the lowest common denominator and the lowest age in order to fill immense theatres, and that eliminates a lot of potential material. Absinthe does not try to appeal to everyone, which allows it to be extra appealing to some.. . 3) The quality of the performances is top notch. Different performers perform different routines. Even for someone like me who has seen a lot of different performers, I have not seen many of the routines in Absinthe. They combine athleticism, artistry, beauty, comedy, and music in well choreographed routines.. . If you are a prude, don't go - you may be offended as a couple of other reviews pointed out. Even if you think you have seen everything, you have not seen Absinthe.
We had some friends in town that wanted to check out the show. I was worried when purchasing the tickets and seeing that the show was going to be in what looked like a beer garden type of tent. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. The inside looks GREAT!!! It has a somewhat whymsical feel to it. . . The show itself was pretty good, you can't compare it to some of the bigger shows out here since it has a different approach. My friends and I loved it, the show has a little bit of everything. There is some acrobatics, lots of nasty jokes and a little bit of crowd interaction.. . If your going to try the drinks steer away from anything with absinthe in it since it's a very strong taste and it took us almost the whole show to get them down. . . It's a great show, I would say you have to see at atleast once.
Great laughs and huge entertainment. If you want something off the beaten path and jaw dropping, this is it. Splurge for the VIP ticket, the speakeasy pre-show room and first choice of seats is well worth it.
Easily one of the best shows in Vegas !!!! Worth every penny!! Didn't know what to expect but laughed my f@&king ass off!!
I had been wanting to see this show since I read the very first reviews but it was tough getting the same night off of work as my husband. Finally, the stars aligned and we both had a Friday night off. Absinthe was my first thought. We obtained VIP tickets for Absinthe at the original Spiegeltent at Caesars Palace on Fri, May 13, 2011 07:30 PM performance, it's just taken me forever to write the review.. . Walking in to the public courtyard, one is greeted with an eclectic collection of random objects- a spiral staircase up to a lookout point, walls of mirrors, shuffleboard, bars for cocktails, a food truck for pre-show snacks, fun to explore and a nice change of pace from waiting in a theater lobby.. . Hmmm... what's with the green phone booth over there???. . The green phone booth turned out to be the secret entrance to the VIP staging area *IF* you know the password.. . Once you give the password, you'll be admitted into the Speakeasy which is shielded from public view and public access. We weren't even inside for the show yet and we were having a great time!. . The little Speakeasy was a nice place to relax and have a drink before going in to the tent. There were some comfy chairs, a few swings and one gold colored, red plush seated throne.. . VIP ticket holders were granted early admission to the Spiegeltent. Once inside, we grabbed a two seat table less than 10 feet from the stage. I sat in a wooden chair and noticed it was very uncomfortable.... and higher than the others. Well, I'd have a good view!. . The first act was a performer balancing chairs on each other and climbing up the stack. A stagehand came up behind me and took my chair, imaginemy surprise when it was handed up to the stage for the performer to add to his stack! Wow!!! That's pretty cool! I love audience participation!. . Angel and her bubble dance was really fun. She has lovely boobs.. . The rollerskating duo really had us on the edges of our seats. (Luckily, I was given another chair to sit on). Those skates were very close to us as they whizzed in a circle! Being so close added a nice level of extra excitement to an already awesome show!. . The Gazillionaire is raunchy, vulgar and completely uncensored, all in a charming way. I think he is a perfect host for this show. If you do choose to sit up close, be warned that he may single you out for ridicule. I wasn't offended by his words but others may not want to hear about racist jokes, cum, or sluts.. . The aerial silk routine may or may not have intentionally revealed some male genitalia, part of the act, or accidentally, there was a showing of cock and balls. Hysterical in the context of the act.. . The Green Fairy is quite sexy during her appearances and if you're close to her, you make leave covered in glitter.. . Ladies, volunteer your services and your exhibitionist side for a free shot of Absinthe. I'll leave it up to your imagination.... . There are a few other acts, each impressive in its own right. . . Absinthe is absolutely worth every dollar of the full price admission but if you can get discount tickets, don't pass this one up!. . And finally . . . Penny. Oh dear, sweet Penny. YOU are funny as hell and left us with cramps in our sides from laughing so hard. I hope you continue to do your puppet show as Absinthe evolves and moves to its new location.. . I want to come see the show again!
Really, enjoyed this. If you can handle the black liquorish taste, I highly recommend absinthe cocktails before the show!. Look for the half off tickets booths on the strip, I got in for 60 bucks.
Holy crap, this show was awesome!. . 1.  There's no f**** kids around.  The only other shows that are like that are usually because of all the boobs being flashed around, which is not something I'm really interested in seeing with my SO.. . 2.  The comedy aspects of the show were dead on.  Better than some standup material I've been forced to two drink minimum myself through.. . 3.  You're so damn close...  Like literally 2 feet away from amazing acts of gymnastics.. . 4.  The line for beer/wine is short and super close to the stage.  Also, they serve Chimay :). . Seriously, this is 100 times better than any of the Cirque shows that cost twice the price.  I highly highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a crude sense of humor and some amazing acrobatics.
Frickin HILARIOUS!!! Not for children, or people who can't handle cursing. A GREAT show for adults looking for a fun way to spend a couple hours in Vegas!
If you're open-minded, love and appreciate creativity and raunchy humor, don't bother with anything else in Vegas.  This is your show.. . Absinthe may best be described as Burlesque+Rocky Horror Picture Show+Cirque du Soleil; and I enjoyed every decadent, make you blush, joke and the amazing feats of the wonderfully talented cast.. . An old school, 1-ringadult circus, it's not for the faint of heart or modest.  The Gazillionaire (aka Ring Master) and Penny are your hosts and they do an incredible job of transporting you away from wherever your thoughts may be into a hysterically twistedly funny world filled with beautiful people who can do amazing things with their bodies and beautifully sultry voice (their is one singer) and make you laugh and gasp in awe at the same time.. . I haven't laughed this hard in a long time, and how good this cast is, just reminds me how comedy is probably one of the most difficult things to do in the performing arts.  Kudos to the creator and the genius of the incredible team members who put this great show on for people like us to enjoy.. . Hands down one of the best shows I've ever seen, anywhere.. . Did I mention?  It's animal-free (=cruelty-free)!  Another bonus!
This is show is worth seeing. Period. . . All of the other "circus" shows in Vegas are great and astounding, but the intimate atmosphere of this smaller venue raises the spectacularity of the feats of dexterity, strength and sensuality up to astonishingly high levels of delight. . . An excellent production!
One of the most entertaining shows. Great mix of comedy and acrobatics. There aren't any bad seats but I think if you pay for the VIP seating you might interact with the host a little more aka picked on. . . This definitely isn't a kid friendly show. There aren't  any nudity but unless you enjoy prude humor I wouldn't recommend going. The stage is extremely small and all the action is right in front of you. Its roughly 90 minutes long and I enjoyed every second of it. I will definitely be going back to see if some of the audience interaction was staged because I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.
Only five stars??? I need six stars, seven stars! I need 14 stars and a giant black unicorn penis! It was f***ing great! Abso-f***ing-lutely amazing!. . "Oh naughty Ryan, you're not supposed to swear in Yelp reviews, you incorrigible cad!" F**K YOU!. . That's kinda the attitude you need to have going into this show, because f-bombs, s-bombs, and vivid, graphic, lewd and raunchy descriptions of sex acts will be thrown about like glitter at a gay bar. And it's a friggin' RIOT. I have not laughed so hard in YEARS. The Gazillionaire and his potty-mouth sex-craved assistant Penny will have you rolling in the aisles and laughing about it for days.. . (Hi Penny. Call me.). . But beyond the vulgarity and massive LOLs, the acts that perform are legit, and will boggle your mind. It's done on a very small stage-in-the-round without safety nets. When the opening act was standing on a tower of precariously-balanced tower of ten chairs nearly touching the roof of the "big top" I knew we were in for some amazing feats.. . The theatre evokes the feeling of a run-down circus tent, and there are bars outside and inside for your libation needs.. . This has now replaced "Love" as "The Show You MUST See in Vegas." It's that f***ing good. I could see this one over and over. Think "'Rocky Horror' does Cirque, but less froofy." That's what you get.. . So get on over to Caesars Palace, get yourself all s**t-faced, lose your inhibitions, and enjoy the best f***ing show in Vegas. No tight-a$$es allowed; you WILL be forcibly loosened.
Should I be offended or a bit turned on? In all honesty, this is a wildly entertaining show. One should come to Absinthe with an open mind and a sense of humor because nowhere else will you hear so much profanity, vulgarity, racism, sexism, and gay slurs being used. Meeting the cast after the performance, it is easy to see that it is all an act. . . If there were any conflicting emotions whirling around in my head; it was about how fantastic this show was, how the performers could do half of the stunts, and when was the next time I was going to head to the gym. (The answer was today) . . Be warned that no one is safe from the sharp wit of the Gazillionaire. At the half way mark, there is an opportunity for audience participation. Do not sit in the front row and hide if sexually provocative actions make you nervous. . . From start to finish, I was laughing so hard that a tear almost ran down my leg. Just kidding, my cheeks just hurt really badly.
Definitely not the typical Vegas acrobat show. VIP seating is not for the faint of heart since you'll most likely get picked on during the acts. That said, it might be worth it. The show is in a tent in front of Caesars with a divy, surreal yet cozy atmosphere. First, you enter through a not-so-secret entrance (green phone booth) and are seated about 2 feet from the stage and therefore, feel like part of the show. Acrobats are truly amazing and the "mature" comedy is pee-inducing. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has a raunchy sense of humor. . . Want to spice up a date night? You must go.
Hot Damn! So wroooong but so right!. . Not a show you take your mother to, that's for sure. . . Nothing could have prepared me for the Gazillionaire and Penny. NOTHING! Mix their antics with astonishingly amazing acrobats that produce fear and awe, throw in some vaudeville and you've got one hell of a treat. It's vulgar, obscene, raunchy, bawdy...you get the picture? I don't know what I enjoyed the most - the debauchery or the acrobats!. . The setting: Spiegeltent, an intimate tiny arena inside a tent erected outside of Caesar's. The stage is tiny, making the stunts that much more impressive. The acrobats are performing mere feet from the audience and right over our heads at times. Warning- the wooden folding chairs are very uncomfortable and really hurt my back, so you best get really drunk and maybe you won't notice the pain!. . Lots of T & A, washboard abs and bulging packages, but no complaints from moi!. . A MUST SEE when in Vegas!
Absinthe in a word was "Incredible"!! If Cirque du Soleil had a funny, acid dropping uncle, he would be Absinthe. From the moment the show began I was in awe of the acrobatic skills of the performers and laughing my ass off at The Gazillionaire and his cast of co-stars. Amazingly most of the show took place on a circular stage that measured about 8 feet across and is housed in a tent in front of Caesar's Palace. . .   The Gazillionaire and his side-kick Penny are the stars of the show and provide most of the comedic moments and they play off of each other quite well. Between the Gazillionaire's jabs at the audience and Penny's wacky rants you'll belly-laugh throughout the show. The acrobatic feats on stage are easily on the level you would see at any Cirque show on the strip. The women in the audience seemed to appreciate the young, muscular acrobats performing onstage. The fact is I think my wife had "chick-wood" through most of the show. . .   Seriously, the whole show was spectacular and I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn't offended by four letter words, nearly bare breasts, dude's bulges, female audience members "motor boating" each other or a unicorn with a black shlong in place of its horn! Enjoy!!
Ah-mazziinnngggg!!! Absinthe was one of the best shows I have seen on the strip in a long time.  I've seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows and while they're all great shows, Absinthe is a mixture of acrobatics and raunchy comedy.  Just like the other reviews, this show is not for everyone.  . . I loved the intimate setting of the venue.  I thought I was the only person who knew of Esquivel and loved the fact that you waited for the show listening to his new age bachelor pad music. I wasn't hip on the uncomfortable chairs, but after the performance started, the chairs really didn't matter.  The performers are so close and their abilities of contortion, balance and stamina are mind blowing.  Also, Penny and The Gazillionaire had me nearly peeing my pants because they were so hilarious and you can't beat a comedy duo that can get an "old, Republican looking" woman to motorboat an "easy" slut.  That had the crowd going wild.. . All in all, Absinthe is a MUST see (for non-prudish people) and it's worth every penny.
I  saw this one of a kind show with my wife on a Saturday night. this is easily one of the best shows we have seen in Vegas. Very, very funny and entertaining. I don't recall the last time I've heard my wife laugh so hard. Not a show for the meek but a great value for the money. Full of energy.
I really loved Absinthe. It was hilarious, vulgar and oddly awe-inspiring at the same time. I like to describe the show as, "Cirque de Soleil and the Moulin Rouge were hit by a Rocky Horror Picture Show bus.". . My favorite part of Absinthe was the Gazillionaire and his slightly slow, side-kick Penny. As someone who loves self-deprecating humor, laughing with and at the rest of the audience as the Gazillionaire poked-fun at their race, sexual orientation and political stance was side-splitting. Just be warned, this show is not for the timid or for anyone who takes themselves too seriously (especially if you sit in the front row).. . The show is performed in a tent outside of Caesars Palace and since the setting is on the smaller side you can see the action from any seat in the house. The show did a decent job switching from the comedy routine to showcase the talented acrobatic acts and back again without loosing my attention. . . Another plus, you can actually enjoy a cocktail of absinthe while you watch the show. Yum!
Absinthe isthe LEAST PC show I have ever seen - what a breath of fresh air!  It's raunchy, sexy and simply outrageous!  Don't see it if you are easily offended- nobody in the audience is safe from ridicule.. . Aside from the comedy, there is some huge talent in the cast. If you are a fan of acrobatics and Cirque-style amazing feats, you won't be disappointed. The acts were amazing and seeing everything so close-up in such a small venue makes it all the more fantastic.  . . No, the seats are not the most comfortable but who cares? You will be so entertained you really won't notice.  Next trip to Vegas, put this one on your must-see list!
A quaint setting for an entertaining  90 minute show. Filled with beautiful girls , great circus acts and a funny master or ceremony.. If you easily offended with bad language or a little nudity then this show is not for you.. It is non stop action.. If you don't like to get pick on I would not sit close to the stage, especially the VIP seats in the first row.. It reminds me of a grown up Cirque DE Soliel, that is for grown ups.. We had VIP tickets, you enter through a phone booth that has a fake wall.. The only compliant is that the seats are very uncomfortable, how hard would it be to put pads on the wooden chairs.. They let you take pictures and video the show.. A show worth seeing.. You won't be disappointed.
Hilarious, risque, obscene and just simply amazing! Inside a tent, with near naked girls, circus acts and a gazillionaire who kept me laughing for a while, was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I had VIP seats, which was only a few feet away from the stage. I would definitely recommend this to my buddies.
This is THE BEST show in Vegas right now.  Raunchy humor and amazing acrobatic performances.  Very intimate setting.  Most seats provide a great view of the stage.  This is Cirque du Soleil without the kiddie comedy.  You would be missing out if you don't see this show.
Absinthe is unlike the other shows you may catch in Vegas - it's got components of stand-up comedy, circus, and burlesque, but it's intimate in a small venue. . . Be willing to laugh at things that might make you uncomfortable - show up, let it happen, and have fun. If you are easily offended, this isn't for you. If you need to be politically correct, this isn't for you. If you are open to nipple tassles, men in speedos, rauchy humor and laughing hysterically, this is your scene.. . I splurged for "VIP" section tickets, and can't believe how close I was to the performers. Amazing. Be advised the whole show is general admission, and the VIP section is too (but the seats to choose from are front row and tables).. . Foul-mouthed, politically incorrect, and filled with truly impressive entertainers, Absinthe is worth every penny and highly recommended. . . Loved this show.
Sexy, funny, and filled with "wow" moments! This was my first cirque show and I think it spoiled me forever. This show as pointed out before has a good mix of standup comedy, acrobats and burlesque. In particular, I enjoyed the two gymnasts' performance, and the chair piling. Keep in mind that you might not want to bring kids to this show though, since it's quite explicit in the language used and the scenes portrayed. . . I have never had my jaw drop so many times in a single show! Like their slogan says, if you have time to attend only one show in Vegas, this should be at the top of your list!
This show was awesomely vulgar and hilarious, on top of all the badass acrobatic acts.. . I believe most of the seating is first come first served.  We arrived maybe 20 minutes before the show started and only the back rows were open.  The space is pretty small in a good way, so everyone can see everything from anywhere.  It's in a massive tent and along the walls are reserved tables, but we found one spot that was open.  I didn't see anyone claim any of the the reserved tables either.. . You will get picked on if you're close enough to the front, so if you're uncomfortable with that then you probably shouldn't even watch this show.. . Most of the girls are pretty ridonculous as well.. . Penny has a very talented foul mouth.
One of the best shows I have seen in a very long time! Everything other Yelpers have said is all true. Its definitely risque, offensive, full of comedy, talented performers, super explicit, funny and just jaw dropping performances by all and I loved every minute of it. Definitely makes one want to go to the gym and work on their fitness.Come and watch this show and you will not be disappointed. The show is general admission, so get there alittle early so you can get a good seat,  wherever you sit, you will have a good time. Recommend!
So the wife and I ended up here last Friday after we learned that Zumanity was sold out, and we were told that this would be a good alternative. We were hesitant at first and unsure if we should see this, especially since we had never heard of this show before. After quickly consulting my fellow yelpers, we opted to buy tickets for the late showing of Absinthe. Let me tell you what a pleasant surprise this was! First off, it is 1st come 1st serve seating. The seats aren't elevated or risen like a standard theater or stadium, but right behind one another, meaning you can't see over the person in front of you. We sat in the very back, as those seats were slightly elevated. This is a fairly small tent, so we were able to see really well. If we were ever to go to another venue like this, we would choose the exact same seats. The front is where you don't want to be, unless you would like to be material for the host.. . As for the show itself, it was really good. Very crude, offensive, all-inclusive humor. He picked on an older white couple (which he called the republicans) several times throughout the evening. He referred to a group of young ladies on the 1st row as sluts multiple times. He made reference to 4 black males who were towards the back of the theater saying that it was racist that they had to sit that far back, and that they had them separated from the other black people in the audience. There were several other racial jokes, lots of sexual references(to include a very descriptive/explicit puppet show by the potty mouthed hostess), stunts and acrobatics(a chair stacker, a couple on roller skates, Russian gymnasts & a tightrope act were our favorites. All acts were quite impressive though), and a bit of burlesque(tassles and bows covering the tips of the boobies). My wife and I found this show extremely hilarious and entertaining, but a lot of people I know would look at me funny for having been to and enjoyed this show(provided they knew about it, which I highly doubt is the case). Good for date night and even a night out with the guys or girls. I wouldn't bring my parents, co-workers, in-laws, or anyone I was trying to impress. The older couple in front of us looked extremely uncomfortable and I think I may have seen them laughing once, while my wife and I had tears and headaches from the laughing. As I said in my Zumanity review, people liken these shows to each other, but there isn't much comparison as they are both pretty different. I guess if you toned down the hosts here(A LOT) it would be fairly similar to Zumanity.. . For the record, we are both early thirties and I am black and she is Asian, but neither of us are easily offended and we're both open-minded. You will have to risk/determine for yourself if this show is good for you or not. In summary, a great show that I would highly recommend to some of my circles of friends, but probably not all.
We absolutely loved this show. First of all, there are the amazing acrobatic stunts. I couldn't believe some of the stuff they were able to do. With the size of the tent, every seat is a good seat, and you have an up close and personal view of everything that is being done. Besides the acrobatics, there was also some great, highly offensive (to some), politically incorrect, raunchy comedy...which was awesome. My husband and I laughed until we cried. If you sit in the front, there is a good chance you could be picked on, so don't sit there unless you are ok with that. And if you are easily offended, or are a big ol' stick in the mud, don't bother going to this show. But if you have a fun sense of humor and enjoy seeing some fun acrobatic stunts, then this is the show for you.
WHERE TO START?. . So on our last day staying at the Cosmpolitan we decided that we wanted to see a show (Saturday) and went to the concierge. She really insisted that we see Absinthe. I had never heard of this show and was a little skeptical but she really pushed this show so we decided to just give it a try.. . We purchased the VIP tickets and arrived 30 minutes before the show. We were still able to snag front row seats for the earlier 7:00pm show. The entire room was full when the show started.. . It is suuuch a unique experience. I have seen various shows in Vegas such as Zumanity, Peepshow, Crazy Horse, "O", & more that I can't even remember (obviously weren't the greatest) and I can honestly say that Absinthe was the best show that I have ever seen in my entire life.. . Get there early as the front seats are the best in my opinion. We were in the center of the entire show.. . The host was sooo funny my fiance and I were both crying. My cheeks hurt from laughing so hard. He made the funniest jokes about the audience members and the entire room was roaring with laughter.. . The jokes are EXTREMELY sexually oriented. Do NOT see if it is a first date or something along those lines as it would be an uncomfortable experience. I saw a bunch of girls with one of the girls' father so I was pretty surprised with that but they all had a great time. He got two audience members to stick out their tongues and touch them against each other (one older lady and a very young party girl). It was such a funny experience. I have never seen any show like this and have been spoiled for the best for my life.. . If you see ONEEEE show in Vegas make SURE it's Absinthe.. . The show is a mix of comedy & acrobats. Bottom line.. . -- Go to the bathroom before as the bathroom is outside of the theater and if you come back during a performance they will make you wait. . -- If you don't want to be picked on or are shy do not sit in the front rows. . -- They let you videotape and take pictures the entire time as long as there is no flash. . -- If you are buying general admission tickets (not VIP) go to the actual box office to purchase them because there is a guy outside handing out $20 off tickets to the show. It does NOT apply to VIP tickets (which are honestly the best seats).. . There is one drink included with VIP so it's really worth it to get those tickets. I had a glass of wine with the voucher and I swear they must have given me the entire bottle. Definitely got our money's worth.. . We will probably go back to see this show honestly and I have never said that about any show. It is a MUST MUST MUST see.
::Happy Dance::. . I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain to you people how amazing this show is. If you don't go see it, you lose. Simple as that. . . Rule 1: If you're a prude, conservative, religious zealot or an overall boring person that never sins, swears or has sex; get out of Vegas and go see The Muppet's or something. Absinthe is heavy on the dirty words, racist slang and sexual innuendo.. . Rule 2: Don't go see this show with your parents. Awkward.. . Rule 3: There are an excessive amount of super sexy chicks and seriously buff dudes. Save your cats calls when the ball and chain isn't around. . . Rule 4: Ignore the seating. It may seem tight and slightly uncomfortable, but when the show starts you won't notice anything but the amazingness in front of you. . . Rule 5: Have a great time. It truly is an incredible show. The best I've seen in Vegas to date.
Warning This Show is Rated R By the MPAA, actually it's Rated a Hard R, actually it's more like a Throbbing, Veiny, Hard R, well you get the point.. . Imagine if Rock Horror Picture Show had a Baby with Cirque De Soleil, and that baby lived in a tent in front of Caesars Palace.. . The show opens with Melody Sweets who does a nice burlesque opening, we are then introduced to Penny Pibbets and the Gazillionaire who serve as our tour guides into the world of Absinthe. . . I've seen the show 4 times (tonight will make #5) and each time it's a little different. They have a few different acts that rotate through depending on the night, but they're all entertaining.. . If any of my friends visit, and they want to see a show, I always recommend Absinthe. Hell I'll even tell customers to go to see the show, it's gotten to the point where I almost want a referral card so they know I sent them.. . This show is a MUST SEE IN VEGAS, hands down it is the best show on the strip. It may be the best show I've ever seen!
Absolutely loved this show and enjoyed every minute of it! I have never heard of it or knew it existed til a Yelp event. Its definitely worth seeing, and I havent laughed that hard in a while... it was beyond hilarious. If you get offended easily or don't have a sense of humor, this show probably isn't for you, but if you're like me and have a twisted sense of humor, this show is definitely 100% for you!! I loved that no matter what seat you pick, its still a good seat cuz the stage/performances are basically in the center of the tent. I would love to see this show again sometimes!
Favorite show ever! . I had so much fun, I wanted to move into that tent and never leave, especially with that type of humor they have going on in there! Hilarious! Filthy dirty language and soooo funny! We loved every minute of it.
This show is AMAZING!  Highlyrecommended!  We sat in the VIP, the chairs were hard and I felt cramped.  (the chairs were arranged in rows in a circle around the stage).  I would definitely pay less to sit in the back, it looked a lot more comfortable plus it would be easier to make a visit to the bar! Also if you sit in the back there's less of a chance you will get picked on!. . This is an R rated (lots of cussing and sex talk) funny circus with some burlesque, acrobatics, and other cool stunts.  The acts were amazing, the comedians so funny, I literally laughed out loud!   We will DEFINITELY see Absinthe next time we are in Vegas!
Just do it.
Just go see it.  Part raunchy comedy, part Cirque du Soleil, part burlesque.  Freaking hilarious, along with great music.  Definitely NOT for the kids OR the conservative types.  But it was the first show I saw in Vegas and i LOVED IT.  Somewhat pricey at $79 (or VIP for $109 which is notworth it), it's a small theater and there's really no bad seat in the house.  GO SEE IT!!!
So the ads for Absinthe don't really tell you what the show is about.  And when it starts, I think about the pitch for Spectacular!Spectacular! in the movie Moulin Rouge!-- lots of adjectives but nothing really to say what it's about or why it should be made.. . And even after seeing it, I can't exactly describe it to you.  You just have to go.  Because it's awesome.. . The show is in a tent at Caesar's-- only 7 rows deep.  There's some burlesque from a singer who has 3 numbers (one striptease to pasties, one separate number, and one "reverse strip" back to her costume), some comedy done by the "billionaire" who supposedly funds the show and acts as an MC, and his assistant Penny, who's a cross between an oversexed robot and a mental patient, and then acrobatics/gymnastics.. . The singer is Vegas-level fine.  The comedy is funny, though the lowest level (making fun of a Japanese person in the audience for not having a camera... making fun of the white guy in boat shoes' made-up fear of the black lady sitting behind him... you get it).  I felt myself thinking "Really, you're telling this joke?" a number of times, but still couldn't help but laugh.  A bunch.. . But what makes this show is the acrobatics/gymnastics.  There are tightrope walkers.  But instead of them being 100 yards away from you, they're RIGHT THERE.  Their balance poles might hit you in the head.  There's a roller skate duo (skating in tiny circles on the 8 foot stage) where the Billionaire says beforehand: "Those of you in the front row, don't stand up during this act--you'll get hit in the face."  There are trapese artists, Russian acrobats, and other contortionists.  And they're all amazing.  . I don't want to ruin the surprises, because multiple times I said "No, they're not going to do THAT," and they did.  And it's all so close, you can hear the breathing, see the sweat, feel the tension.. . Totally enjoyable show, in a beautiful tent (most people sit in wooden chairs, but there are fun couches, barber chairs, etc., toward the back that you might get if you ask nicely), great (but expensive) absinthe-based cocktails, and a fun time.. . I can see why there's not a lot of description on Absinthe's advertising--the show is just indescribable.
If you are visiting Vegas, do not come back without watching this show. It's awesome and completely worth the money. Just go for it.
By far one of the best shows in Vegas! This is an adults only, combination of burlesque sensuality, vulgar comedy, cirque style acrobatics, and amazing, over the top, stunts that can't be described. Like another reviewer said, its not a Cirque de Soleil, but is comparable, without being so "magical", and yet managing to be 10 times more over the top. I would go see this show again next time I'm in Vegas...I literally had my mouth open in awe for the majority of the show....GO SEE IT!! Don't bring anyone to the show who is easily offended. Its fantastic.
This and O are my favorite cirque de soleil shows in Vegas!  This show may be the best simply because you are so close to the action and it is action packed!!  Don't go if you are sensitive and get your feelings hurt because they do quite a bit of banter with the audience.  Many death defying and gravity defying stunts inches from your face!!!
This show was amazing!!! Something very different from any production I've ever seen, including the Cirque d'Soleil shows.  The small tent is so intimate, dark and cozy, with retro carnival themed bars inside.. . That said, I was so shocked by some of the jokes they made, I couldn't even laugh.  I was too busy gasping and peeking through my hands to see if the audience members "the millionaire" had insulted were going to climb up and punch him.. . Love Angel Porrino, but her performance was kinda mehh...oh well.  She's still so cute!!. . Agree with the other reviewers...you WILL be targeted if you sit in the first couple rows!! Also, get a dragonberry mojito from the stand outside.  They are delicious!  Then sit back and enjoy the show :)
Was watching for the black unicorn all night! Never saw it!Wanna go back and try to find it again ..... . Be prepared for your sides and cheeks to hurt from laughing! . Without duplicating what all the other reviews say - and they are spot on! Just go see it. Affordable and THE best show on the strip.
This was without a doubt the best show I have seen in my entire 6 years of living in Las Vegas, however, I would not reccomend this show to those who can't appreciate a little nudity and extremely raunchy comedy. I really enjoyed the intimate atmosphere and eclectic decor inside the tent. Its kind of like some twisted comedy show meets cirque du soleil on mushrooms. Not for everyone, but it was right up my alley. I have not laughed like that in a while. Plus, tickets were reletively affordable in comparison to most of the cheesy commercial shows that you usually see on the strip. I am disappointed that Absinthe will only be in Las Vegas for a limited time because I would actually love totake some friends from out of town and see it again. Definitely go see this show if you have the opportunity.
When you walk up the big white tent, you are definitely caught off guard as soon as you walk in. Immediately you are fascinated by its decor - an intimate, French bohemian styled venue that is impressive and fun. Once you are seated, thee is waitress service selling the bartender's concoction of the evening for $5. Delicious and a pleasant surprise, if I do say so.. . And this show is fucking fantastic! But if you hate that I swore, then you'll go over the edge in offense at the banter of the host/ funding entity the Gazillonare and his sidekick, Penny Pippets. The swear words are abundant, the jokes are extremely raunchy, but it was continual laughter until tears came to your eyes and your side aches. If you are prudish or are a child, this show is not for you.. . The acrobatic performances were undeniably A1, fantastic and awe inspiring. The feats stand up to Any Cirque show. The intimate setting of the tent made it that much better because they were right there. The singer and burlesque singer (who went down to pasties) was good.. . The surprising pluses - . The waitress service for the specialty drinks which saved us going to a congested bar and the intimate setting. You aren't going to get that feeling seeing many other shows.. The fact that you can take pictures and video. You couldn't use a flash, but with the lighting, it didn't matter in the slightest.. . The disappointment - the seating. I definitely would have ponied up the dough to get out of the tiny, uncomfortable chairs to get a table. The show is worth spending that extra cheddar on better seats. . . Go see this show without the children and enjoy yourself. It's worth the money and would be a consideration to see more than once.
I went to Absinthe for the first time last night not knowing what to expect.  Found myself in a bizarre, small-tent circus with very adult humor.  It was an absolutely awesome time!  The circus acts were great, and because it's a small venue it's all happening right in front of you.  The comedy in between acts gives it a raunchy variety show feel and, from what I can tell, everyone was laughing.  It's not a show for kids, most grandmas from Ohio, those who take themselves too seriously, or the sober (and to paraphrase the show, if you're sober, what are you doing in Vegas?  It's a terrible vacation destination).. . For some reason, I was in fact sober during the show, but found myself laughing (LOLing) and saying "Wow" a lot.  Add this to your must-see list!
This is the second Vegas show I've ever watched and I loved it! Regular priced seating ran out, so my boyfriend and I opted for the VIP seating (we had 2nd row). There's a secret entrance for VIP to the show, which is a green telephone booth. The show is set inside a tent right outside of Caesars Palace. The gazillionaire and his assistant made me crack up so hard while they introduced each act, and each act was amazing with all the body strength and flexibility! I highly recommend Absinthe to anyone, except young children (if they're even able to get in). You would have to have an open mind with crude humor that's for sure! btw, VIP gets you a drink ticket as well.. . For the length of the show, it was better to be entertained than to gamble your money away!
A friend recommended this show, .  I was sold.  We saw the first sown on Friday, 5/4, and it was FANTASTIC.   It's not for kids, and I was laughing and in awe the entire hour and a half!  I will go back!  The acts were amazing, incredible talent, the venue issmall, so all seats are great seats.  I saw negative feedback about the seating, it's cozy, folding type chairs, hooked together, so you can't move to give space between the next person, but it really doesn't make a difference.   The comedy is great, and I can't wait to go back.  When I talked about the show I saw, it was a bit different than the one my friend saw, so I guess they do change it up.  Looking forward to seeing this again!!
Cirque meets Rocky Horror, the ads trumpet.  I think that sells Absinthe short. I'd say, Cirque meets Rocky Horror over a warm crack pipe is more like it.. . Mind boggling circus acts go down on a 9' stage insanely close to the audience. the Gazillionaire and his assistant Penny blow through the wall of good taste like the Kool Aid Man with their uproariously, screamingly funny antics. Penny's shockingly obscene puppet show and their performance as alter egos Ivan and Ivana are particular highlights.. . Torch songstress, beautiful burlesque dream and future ex-wife Melody Sweets seduces the audience with her sultry voice. The dizzyingly fast Green Tornado are literally defying death nightly with their roller skating act, performed on the aforementioned 9' wide stage.. . More fun than any other show in Vegas and the first show I recommend to Vegas visitors when anybody asks.
I'd heard good things about Absinthe, but after a friend who's opinion I value highly raved about it, I decided it was time to see it. It was even better than I'd heard and it's a show that I'll be back to see again ASAP.. .  The tent itself is amazing! I've walked past the tent many times and not thought much about it from the outside; the inside is like an entirely separate world that's got something to look at in every direction. It's small enough that there really isn't a bad seat in the house. . .  The humor is amazingly twisted and it's really not a show for everybody; if you are easily offended, there is a very real chance you will experience moments of panic and absolute mortification. If you can appreciate a quick wit, you will love this show for everything that Gaz and Penny are not afraid to say. . .  The acts themselves are ridiculously impressive. As a former student of gymnastics and aerial arts, I was seriously impressed at the level of performers they had in such a small, intimate show. The acts themselves are an amazing balance between intimate and technical, each breath-taking in different ways. . .  This is without a doubt, my new favorite show in Las Vegas.
Jaw-dropping. Hilarious. An all around amazing show.  The stunt acts are integrated with a comedy skit that runs throughout the show and entails crude/raunchy humor.  Absinthe was definitely worth the long line and $100/ticket.  Get in line early (general admission) if you want a close seat/to be made fun of because they interact with the first 2 rows of the audience!
The funniest, most entertaining show I've seen in a really long time. I'm not going to go into details because enough people already have. I will easily make it a point to see it again. Well, unless there is another mammoth woman sitting in front of me and my lady recording the entire freakin' show on her crappy cell phone. Oh yeah, that's my only gripe, you are packed in like tuna in those nasty canned tuna in water things.
Can't wait to see it again!!! With a new cast!!!  My absolute FAVORITE Vegas show so far... VERY raunchy and hilarious, not for the easily offended.  The acrobatics are just awesome, and what these people can do with such a small place, it amazes me.  I've seen it twice!
Loved it, great show overall. Much more interesting than most shows due to the mixture of comedy, acrobatics, and overall execution of the script. The show is in Caesars Palace in a tent outside the lobby. Highly suggested that you see this one.
On trip to town with husband.  One of the best shows I've seen.  Performers are amazing & enjoyed tent atmosphere!  Very enjoyable & excellent staff & service!
The best show I have ever seen...If you go to see a show in Vegas this has to be it...So much fun, and well worth the money!!!
It is impossible to describe this show. Just go and see it! The humor is raunchy, for sure, as is the language, but there is nothing else like Absinthe for amazing, breathtaking, hilarious, jaw-dropping entertainment. I totally loved every moment of it and could easily see it again. . What are you waiting for? Go!
Ive only lived in vegas for 18months now and even though I go out almost every weekend I still havent been to the same show more than once. That is until the night I took my gf to see Absinthe. . . I explained it was an intimate freak show where the front row runs the risk of decapitation during a few events. She wasnt convinced but promised me to keep an open mind.. . Its been about a year since my last visit and it was great to see some new acts and faces. The girls are very sexy and the male performers are equally impressive.. . Be prepared to be offended as they cuss almost every 10mins and even go down the risky racial road but its done in such a way as to not overly offend anyone. . . The gf tensed up, gasped and even covered her eyes once as the acts are done with little to no safety nets. She left saying it was one of the best shows she has seen and she has been here over 10yrs.. . Ok now for my complaints. The seats are uncomfortable. Bring a cushion as they are folding chairs that are strapped down and cant be moved. You are only there for 90 mins so its not that bad.  The lights could be better as you are often looking upwards and being blinded by the stage lights.. . Its a highly recommend show as far as this local is concerned!
This has to be the best, adult show on the strip.  As they advertise this is what would happen if Rocky Horror bred with Cirque Du Soleil.. . it is in the round, and you are a spit shot away from the action, no matter where you sit.  It Is ADULT.  The cast is hilarious, chaotic and yet, organized.  The jokes are coming at you fast and furious, but the acts are pure genius and amazingly talented.. . In a sentence:  Funny kinky sexy funny amazing, upclose, funny and humorous.  Did I mention funny??.
I've seen many of the big time shows in Vegas and this is by far my favorite. It may not be the high production spectacle that other shows are, but the intimate venue makes up for all of that. There are plenty of stunts that are awe-inspiring (like the roller skaters) and there's singing that rivals that of other shows. But, it's the raunchy humor that takes this show over the top. The Gazillionare is an engaging host who doesn't shy away from making fun of any and all audience members. If you're easily offended, this isn't the show for you, but if you enjoy an occasional cock or pussy joke there isn't a better show out there.. . There are 3 tiers of tickets available -- $169, 119, and 89. Tix4tonight had a slight discount for the 2nd and 3rd tier seats at $105 and 75, respectively. If you're a local, you can get discounts at sites like vegas4locals.com where we got $25 off the 3rd tier seats. Of course, that's before taxes and service charges which will add $15-20 per ticket. Still, it's worth the price of admission. And, it may be the only show in Vegas you can say that about.
Perfect experience. They've changed from general seating to reserved seating and locals get $25 off per ticket which my parents drove to the box office and bought for us. The tiny stage looks implausible but it is indeed the base for all the death defying acts. . . The acts are fantastic, every last one of them, in both the performance and the sets/costumes. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole night. And the "filler" (?) banter, crazily obnoxious is a lot more than filler, it's caustically brilliant.  It was up my alley, and I laughed whenever I wasn't gasping for air!. . I've been to several of the cirque du soleil, and this beats them all. Just be forewarned that it's chock full of adult crude humor, but if you get in the spirit of the true vegas, you should settle in nicely.
If you're going to Las Vegas and planning on seeing a Circ Du Soleil show. Stop! Go see Absinthe instead. It's better, sexier, hotter. It's got a little bondage, a lot of skin, all of the things you want to see in a great Las Vegas show plus no kids. You're up close and right in the middle of the action.Great MC's and comedy routines. I've seen all of the Circ shows in LV and this one raises the bar. If you're easily offended by crude humor or have your parents or kids with you, do not go to this show! Other then that be prepared to be entertained. This is one of the best kept secrets on the strip.
A fun, bizarre, exciting, wonderful show in an intimate venue. I sat in the front row and my party and I were made part of the show in very inappropriate but hilarious ways. The show is some BDSM, offensive humor, acrobatics, and boho theater all mixed together in a fantastic way.. . Highly recommended!
"OMG!" Absinthe ( @ Caesar's Palace ) ; Part circus, part peep show, part comedy club ( real dirty! ), part burlesque & 100% fun! "Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror"!!!! All this, and my "FAVORITE" alcohol, " ABSINTHE"! "I Love the 'Little Green Fairies'"! ( "I'm not as think as you drunk I am!" )
Whether you're a gazillionaire or not, this show is worth every single cent.. . I loved this show, dark raunchy humor and world class acts.. . If you've got a dark sense of humor and are not easily offended, check it out.. . Think family guy humor, unrated and on steroids.
My husband and I loved this show. This show has it ALL, a great mix of comedy, raunchy humor, burlesque and superior acrobatics. The music was also great. It is not for the people who would be easily offended or does not like to see skin of either sexes. Yes, some of the jokes I've heard before but one thing about risky humor in regards to race, culture and sex is that you have to make fun of everyone and even yourself so it all fair otherwise it's just racist. . We loved the intimate seating even though it was tight getting in and out. But the tradeoff was the performers in practically in your lap. After you see the performers I am sure you won't complaining.
Yes! If you see one show in Vegas Absinthe has to be it! We went with a group of 9 people and tried to order tickets two weeks in advanced for the VIP row. They didn't have enough in that area so we went for the reserved section which was about $50 less per person. I really wouldn't waste the money on VIP, we were on the sixth row and could see everything. The venue is very small and runs in a circle there is not front and every seat has a clear view of the stage. Most the acts take place up in the air so your looking up for most of the show.. . This show is really only for a certain type of people. They are very raunchy. I saw a few people getting offended by Penny and her sock puppet act ;) Go in with a open mind and you will have a great time.
I have seen Absinthe three times and I am looking forward to my forth. Each time is different from the last; thanks to their inclusion of the unexpected audience. Love it!
Sexy, funny and edge of your seat entertaining is the only way I can describe this show. I have seen it on three separate occasions and it never gets old. I laugh hysterically at all the jokes and the dare devil stunts leave me speechless. This is a show not to be missed.
So we were originally planning on seeing Zumanity because we wanted to check out a good adult-themed show during our honeymoon that wasn't some corny topless faire straight out of Showgirls or a bunch of puffed-up meatheads who can't dance.  But upon reading reviews, while many were very good, we saw quite a bit of "no, no, no, go see Absinthe, way better!"  And that being said...I think we were both quite satisfied by listening and getting the Absinthe tickets.  It's one of the funniest and most amazing shows I've ever been to.. . We got normal reserved tickets with a $20/ticket discount and we didn't need to be closer because even there the action happens mere feet in front of you anyway.  We had a perfect view.  The stunts were absolutely outstanding from the chair-stacking guy to the burlesque, both male stunt teams (the four guys and the bodyguard duo), the intentionally bad sexual-themed ballet duo and the rope and trapeze acts.  The tightrope trio was also unreal and they have to quiet the crowd during one section for a reason - it's quite a scary stunt to perform in such a confined area.  But everything went off to perfection.. . The Gazillionaire and Penny are beyond hilarious.  All of their jokes as anti-PC as it gets, with racist, sexual and Republican jokes going rapid-fire.  If you're easily offended, don't bother coming or whining about it on here, because all you're doing is ruining it for the rest of us who simply don't care and want to see some shocking laughs.  Penny does a sock puppet routine that had people almost falling out of their chairs and the Gazillionaire occasionally interrupting acts to make fun of them was also a fun add-on.  . . We were both so happy that we chose Absinthe as our only show for our honeymoon.  Well worth the money and we left extremely happy for the rest of the night.  I'm pretty sure we'll see it again on our next trip.
Love, love, loved Absinthe!. We used vegas.com to get our tickets, they were at a $20 discount...worth it rather than risking finding the man in the top hat when traveling from out of town.. The seats, suck, but who cares, we had 4th row on the aisle and got general admission pricing, it was awesome. What a view of the feats of strength and the hysterical Gazillionaire and Penny.. Grab a drink at the bar right in the doors of Ceasars...$6 beer versus $8.50 inside the tent. They don't care what you bring in.. A MUST SEE in Vegas...as cool as any cirque show, just smaller, closer, more preverted and way cheaper :-)
Through a sweet friend, my boyfriend and I had gotten VIP tickets to Absinthe last year for my birthday.. . WOW!  There is no better word to describe this show!  The acrobatics and displays of strength, raunchy comedy, sexy burlesque, etc, etc, etc  were simply Ahhhhhh-Mazing!!. . Everyone (over 21) should make this a part of their visit to Vegas!  . . If possible, you should get VIP tickets to gain entrance into the "green room."  It is blue, not green ;)  and totally worth it!  A private bar, some hanging hammock-like seats and an aura of being somewhere only reserved for private eyes only is something else.  . . 5 STARS!  I cannot wait to see it again!
After looking into many Cirque Du Soleil shows for our honeymoon in Vegas we found one that seemed most interesting.. Zumanity.   We read tons of reviews... they seemed good but most mentioned Absinthe.  Better reviews, better price, better and more intimate venue, etc.    I was sold... I craved the adult themed jokes and acrobatics that make you feel like you can do anything!   I am so so so glad we chose Absinthe.. It was raunchy and hilarious.. I laughed or "oooh aaaahh-ed" the whole show.   The Gazillionaire and Penny were a perfect combo for intermissions between each act and they really knew how to put on a good show.  . I will see it again.. and I've already told everyone I know to see it.  . Plus... they offer a really good Absinthe cocktail.. not the Absinthe drink everyone talks about.. with the sugar cube and deliriousness but a cocktail that just tastes so delicious and knocks your socks off.  I was drunk off one drink.  . . LOVED THIS!
Unlike all the other reviews on here, I am not going to give away any of the show! Instead, I will just list the highlights and some low-lights of the night! . . Highlights:. . -Been after Minh for a while to go and see this show, but each time we were in town there was always other things to do! . -Reserving tickets is easy, and we were able to get tickets a couple of hours before the Sunday 8:00pm showing.. -Ticket booth is not located inside of Caesars; instead, it is on the outside across from serendipity 3. . -Outside door staff were friendly, inside some of the ushers were nice too.. -It is true, try, and not sit in the first two rows unless you would like to be a part of the show!. -Two words........... The Gazillionaire!!!!!. -Get ready to laugh..... Anddo not be all-uptight! . -The tent is so pretty inside and I love the feel of the old school circus minus the animals!. -The bartenders "creation of the day" looked and sounded yummi!. -Bring cash for drinks!. -The show was the BEST and it kept you wanting more after each act!!!!. . Now the Low-lights:. -Not being told where the box office was located and having to walk through all of Caesars until we saw the signs outside.. -The rows of wooden chairs are so close together that it was hard not to trip over your own feet (mind you I am 5-1).. -If you have issues sitting shoulder to shoulder with a stranger, then maybe this show is not for you!. -The AC is nice and cool until the show starts, then it is switched off and it is super hot inside. Even worse if the show is sold out!. -Walking to the bar, I almost slipped on some water that was on the floor, told an usher who seemed not to care at all!. -Encountered another usher who was rude and told me that the barline started on the right side of the bar not on the left.. -Bar does not sell on tap water; instead, they have bottled which was $5.00 for a small. ummm pass!
This show was flat out one of the funniest and most entertaining shows I have ever seen.  . I laughed so much my face was sore.  There wasn't a thing that I disliked...except ..the chairs.  . Very uncomfortable chairs.. Otherwise, I would (and am) telling everyone I know to go see it.  . Brilliant
I saw Absinthe last August. I must admit that I was never really excited about the prospect of seeing thse acrobatics shows. Not to say that these guys are not amazing athletes because the stunts they perform are incredible. The night became so much more enjoyable because of the back and forth between the gazillionare and penny. The raunchy dialogue was hilarious and it doubled the show as stand-up comedy. I am not easily offended at all, in fact i wish I would have sat in the front..  The tent is smaller than it appears from the outside and there really are no bad seats inside. At some point you realize just how close the performers are. You are mere feet away from death-defying stunts. It managed to change my mind on the matter of these types of shows. I would definitely attend again. The price was very decent in comparison with the most popular shows on the strip. Give a shot.
This was such an incredibly fun and cute show. There were some amazing feats performed and the humor was right up my husband's alley. It is pretty perverted and foulmouthed so be warned but as long as you don't offend easily it is a raunchy good time to be had and definitely worth seeing if you are in Vegas.
I was laughing the whole time, besides when I was gasping in aww over the acrobatics. . . Loved that the show has no filter and let everything out there. . . Loved the acrobatics . . Absolutely loved Penny Pibbs and her sock puppets. . If you want to see a show that is raunchy, crude, rude, and socially unacceptable then this is it!!!!! It is flat out funny and one of the best shows on the strip.. . However, if you do not like to hear about sex or talk about sex then don't watch it. This is not a show for prudes. . . Venue:. Small white tent. Every seat is a good seat.
Absinthe.  I loved it.  I knew I would.  I can't add anything that could further influence you one way or the other about this show.  You're either in or you're out.  It's not for the easily offended politically correct.  It's not for the Bible-thumping conservatives.  It's not for families.  Oh, but if you fall into any of those three categories, please go and sit up close.  The one thing Absinthe does not have are exploding heads!
This is one of the best live (adult oriented) shows I've ever seen, I highly recommend it to everyone.  Vulgarity is appropriate and pervasive, with smart quality comedy and quick whit you are transported on the bizarre journey only they can bring you on. Well worth the price of admission, mine was free after a 2 hour time share discussion.
Have you ever been watching a Cirque show and thought, "man this is great...but I think it needs more race jokes and people saying 'cunt'"?. . Well, so have I.. . Enter Absinthe, the raunchy answer to the dominating esthetic of Las Vegas acrobatics shows. The venue is small so every seat is a great one. The acrobatics and stunts are truly top notch and your proximity to the performers makes it all the more intense(front row observers do run a serious risk of being kicked in the face). Your hosts, the dashing bazillionaire and adorable Penny Pibbs, clearly have a great time offending the audience and keeping you entertained in between acts.. . The one thing that does suck is that the wooden chairs are pretty uncomfortable.. . If you bring your kids here, you oughta be arrested.. . This is my favorite Vegas show.
My favorite show on the Vegas Strip.  It is in a small circus tent outside of Cesars which is great because tickets are only $60 and you it is so small you can see from any seat because you are so close up.. . It is by far the funniest show ever!  Very very VULGAR AND HILARIOUS!  Not for the uptight, definitely for those who have a sense of humor. I have seen it 4 times and I die laughing out loud over and over every time.  They attack pretty much every stereotype so it is not for the sensitive...remember it is all in good humor!. . The stunts are awesome!  They go really hardcore for such a small stage.  Especially the guy and girl on the roller skates stunt..that is INTENSE!. . GO SEE THIS SHOW IT IS SO WORTH IT!
Is there a show raunchier than Zumanity? Yes, Absinthe.. . With amazing Cirque stunts and not a Cirque show? Yes, Absinthe.. . Where the comedic act was 10 times funnier than Family Guy? Yes, Absinthe. . Where you are judge purely on your looks? Yes, Absinthe. . Where every word out of the guy's mouth is COMPLETELY and UTTERLY wrong? Yes, Absinthe. . Should you watch this show? F@*&ing Yes.. . I have never seen a F@*&ing show this F@*&ing hilarious.  Yet, it was F@*&ing right but so F@*&ing wrong.. . Why am I saying F@*&ing so much?  Watch the F@*&ing show.  It's worth every F@*&ing penny.  Yes, it's that F@*&ing wrong.
This show had me calling/texting/tweeting everyone to come see this as I was leaving the tent... amazing amazing amazing.  . . It was a great mix of humor, "wow"-factor, and the must have vegas sexuality that you can't really get anywhere else without going somewhere creepy.. . But I have to echo everyone else's review - if you can't take vulgar... I mean sometimes offensively vulgar humor and don't want to be picked on by the cast- DON'T GO. I mean at least don't sit in the front row and be unhappy and uptight!. . Small space so you get a pretty good view. Superb performances and hot hot women!
great show -- hilarious and sexy.. . not for super conservative crowds!!
THE BEST SHOW ON THE STRIP!!!!!!! . . I loved it! Laughed my a** off! I recommend this show to everyone! . . Warning: Very raunchy but hilarious!!! You wont regret it! Sooo worth it!
Awesomely entertaining!  If you are not easily offended and want to go but are scared of the negative reviews, just do it -you will be so glad you did!  Raunchy and stereotypical jokes coupled with amazing acrobatics made for great entertainment.  I would see this show again without a question.  Go by the tent in the day and there is usually a guy handing out $20 off coupons, tent is super small so even with general seating you will be very close.  Sit in the front row if you want to be picked on, but it is not mean spirited andis in good fun!
Walking thru the green telephone booth transports you to a Moulin Rouge style theater in the round.    A beautiful greeter handed us both a mini bottle of Chandon champagne that was chilled and lovely. Our seats were perfectly positioned  half way back in the middle and at a cute antique table and chair set no less!  I don't want to spoil the show for anyone with plot etc. but it was so fun and entertaining.  Again as you have heard from any review of Absinth, if you have sensitive ears towards foul language or sexually explicit material run don't walk from this show!   I loved the entire experience and would go back again and again and again!  Oh and Serendipity is right in front of the venue so grab a delicious dessert after the show!
Pretty sure this has to be the best show in vegas. I've got a friend who lives there and has seen all the cirques and probably a bunch of non cirques, and I've seen his two favorite. Those weren't even close to being in the same league as absinthe, as far as entertainment factor goes. This shit was as funny as any stand up I've seen, and the "stunts" were all fairly amazing, or at least incredible to look at (I'm thinking of you, bubble girl). . . The couple that host it were so fucking hilarious... loved the chick's way of getting all spazzy and out of control. When she got pissed at a chick in the audience, probably because she was into in her man (can't remember the details), and yelled (while  being dragged away) "I'll shit in your mouth, bitch!", I knew no show could ever match this.
Loved this show!  The vulgar host was the glue that kept it together, after all it is alot of random acts.  I like when he made the post-menopausal squatty republican lady make out with the 30 year old fat drunk chick. I like penny too, I want to marry her.  It would make sense(cents).
"Ab"solutely "Sinthe"ful Fun!  My jaw is still aching from laughing so much! The 90-minute show went by in a blink of an eye and left us wanting more, more, more! Absinthe mashes up bawdy comedy, titillating burlesque, and stunning acrobatics to create one truly memorable show! Sit in the front row and you might become comedic fodder for the rest of the lively audience! That's exactly what happened to me . . . and while I'm a little on the shy side, I took it in stride as I was pegged as the "Republican Lady" brought up on stage to judge a male lap dance competition between Mr. Middle White America and Mr. Cool Hip Black Dude. I won't tell you any more . . . but it was a riot!!!  A definite must-do in Vegas!!!
Just when I thought I've pretty much watched every show in Vegas, it comes Absinthe. . . They're a new show in town so when I first heard their "If you see one show in your entire life, make it Absinthe!" line I really didn't believe it. But now I do. However you really should watch some other shows including a Cirque Du Soleil one before you go to see Absinthe so you'll know what they're making fun of. . . Can you find a better pair of hosts in town other than Gaz and Penny? I guess not. That said, bring your depressed family/friends, they might just be cured after the show.. . And I was chatting up with a friend I hadn't seen for a whole so I missed the first 15 minutes but I don't regret it. Why because it's definitely worth watching this show again!
The best show in Vegas. . . This show is funny, gritty, and amazing. Taking place on a roughly 5 foot round stage, the front row is only a arm's length away from the performers. This show blows away the Cirque stuff and feels a lot more genuine in the process. There is an option to pay a little extra and get early entry and a free drink voucher, I felt as though the extra cost was worth it to get a front row seat. . . Highly recommended!
Abstract: Best fucking show in Las Vegas, period. . . I have seen Absinthe only on two occasions: once when they were in their original run (it was actually their last week of shows when they could not do any "aerial" acts because the rain had sunken the roof of their tent) and once since they moved on to the permanent structure. . . Spiegelworld, or the area surrounding the venue now, really sucks in comparison to their original set-up. Before you could hang out outside before the show and it felt like you were at a carnival (minus the annoying carnies); now it is like you are outside any concrete slab in any sports venue in the nation. . . Other than that, and the loss of the speed skating acrobats (that moved to Vegas The Show @ V Theatre in Planet Hollywood), the show is not much different. There seems to more seating, and I guess the Gazillionaire says the dreaded F-word a lot less (fag, not fuck)(I read somewhere that they were not going to be saying it at all anymore, but I cannot recall if they did or did not because I was laughing so vivaciously to the stand-up). . . In regards to language: some people cannot bring down their morality shield and hear a couples of fs, cs, and some more fs. Nothing wrong with that; it is your life. Don't go to this show. Go to church instead. Go to Veggie Tales the next time they are ripping people off at Canyon Ridge. Go to a Justin Bieber gig. . . You've been warned. - E. . Postscript. The Gazillionaire and Penny's stand-up should be shown as a litmus for anyone flying or driving in to our lovely city. If the individual does not laugh and find them funny, they should be informed they cannot be permitted into Las Vegas. Instead they should be re-routed or given new driving directions to SLC, UT.
Awesome show. Go through Tix for Tonight to get $20 off if you can't find a coupon. Hilarious & Very raunchy. Don't go if you are offended by sex & racist jokes.. And to those of you that rate is less than 4 stars - you must be a Republican. ;)
One of the BEST shows in Vegas.  At parts I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt.  The things that happened with audience participation are so crazy, I still can't believe that they were able to convince the audience to do some of those things.. . The actual circus acts are amazing, but the highlight is the comic relief.  So so funny, highly recommended.
Laughed so hard my side hurt the next day! SPECTACULAR!
Went to see Absinthe on a whim, but I gotta tell you - I haven't laughed that hard in a LONG time!. . The acts are like "Cirque", but without the sometimes-nebulous "themes" of Cirque shows.  The theater and stage are so small that the audience is right on top of the action, which makes it all the better.  The "Gazillionaire" MC is hilarious - raunchy and politically incorrect in the extreme - but hilarious!. . Three -word summary:  Go see Absinthe!
A must-see in Las Vegas!  I laughed so hard throughout the show and had a great time. The acts were awesome and the comic relief was very funny and spontaneous, especially with the audience participation.  Be forewarned - they do pick on people in the front rows, but it's all in good fun and more entertaining for the rest of us sitting further back.  I think all the seats were pretty good since all the seats were configured around the stage and in close proximity to the stage.  We got our discounted tickets through a Travelzoo offer and saved about $35 off the original prices.. . This show is definitely not for the prim and proper as they make tons of non-pc jokes.  So, if you are offended by swearing, sexual, or racial jokes, this show is not for you.
In a word, brilliant.. . Incredibly funny and raunchy.  Politically incorrect, but no one is left unscathed.  Definitely not a show for kids or someone without a sense of humor.  If you can handle a show with adult language as well as sexual and stereotypically driven humor, then you will be fine.  It's one of the best shows I have seen in years.  My sides ached from laughing so hard.. . Echoing the other posts, do NOT sit in the front row if you are not willing to be the target of the ringleader's humor (both verbally and physically).  (When you come in, the ushers will offer this up.  "Oh, we have some seats in the front row if you'd prefer...")  Also the acts are literally feet away from you and the rollerskating one comes REALLY close to people in the front row if you are skittish. . . But seriously, very very very funny.  Highly recommended.
I laughed so hard I had a coughing fit. . And then another.. And then one more.. If you like inappropriate/pervy/dirty humor then Absinthe is the show for you.
HILARIOUS! Obviously, don't go if you are easily offended. Be preapred to laugh and be astonished throughout the show. Get there early to enjoy a few drinks. Bring a jacket! It's pretty cold outside while you wait. Once you get into the tent, it's pretty warm with everyone in there. Oh ya, Absinthe is located in a tent right outside of Caesar's next to Serendipity. Probably one of the best Vegas shows we have been to, to date. This show is a must.... but once again, only if you are not easily offended!!
This show is SOLID!! Great for tourists & locals because you can take pictures, no flash photography AND video! The venue is small about 7 rows about about 6 chairs wide in 4 sections. You are literally a few feet from the stage. The atmosphere is very circus like. Careful if you get offended easily because there is some crude language & sexual talk. The stunts are awesome & it's a super fun show w/ comedy. If you're wanting a drink get the drinks from outside the venue as the prices are higher inside of it. I highly recommend this show as one of the top three shows you should see if you're visiting or live in Vegas
Best show on the strip? For this nugget it is! Ok, so I haven't seen ALL the shows on the strip but I've seen quite a few and no other show had me laughing so hard or had me so entertained. . . Come with a good attitude and keep the douchebaggery someplace else. This show is raunchy, racy and pretty darn offensive. If you want to really laugh out loud and can stand to hear a few f-bombs being dropped and the occasional, ok, not occasional but constant gay, penis and vagina jokes then this show may be for you. . . Just a tip, no pun intended...you can usually get a coupon outside of Cesar's (strip side) in the afternoon...the seating is tight so be prepared...and if you splurge on the front row seats be ready to possibly be ridiculed.
Absinthe is my #1 recommended show in Vegas, a close second to Frankie Moreno! . . This show is FOR ADULTS ONLY!. . It's hilariously raunchy with a sexy twist. This is a true variety show with a circus theme. This show is not for anyone who is easily offended! It's all in good fun but you need to roll with the punches and be open to A LOT of profanity!. . The audience participation is epic. I've seen this show 4 times and they switch up the skits and it's definitely not staged!. . *Vegas Locals: Absinthe comes up on http://www.houseseats.com every now and then and I've gotten free tickets twice!
What I liked about this show the most is it's very intimate.  The stage is actually very small, and you are literally sitting 10 feet from the performers.  This really adds to the excitement of the show.. . One of the best shows I've seen.  You probably have about 8-10 circus acts and they're all out-of-this-world awesome!!  I mean it when I say it too; all the skits were 10/10 enjoyable.  There's plenty of humor in the "between skits" and lots of "eye-candy" (if you catch my drift :P). . Tips:. -All the seats in the house are good, so you can get away w/ getting the cheapest tickets and you'll still have decent seats.
TOTAL FAN!!! This show is a unique blend of mixing acrobatics, sexy serenades, and outlandish acts that will blow you away! The hosts are amazing; they open the show with making fun of people in the first row (my fav) and then a ton of racial slurs. The jokes are witty and very creative! . Its a small round theatre so you're very up close and personal with the acts. These performers really risk their lives in this show, it's unreal. . . My favorite act was the couple who did twists and flips on skates! Her head gets so close to the slamming on the ground, but they never once slipped or hesitated. Very impressive!  .  . I highly recommend the show, but have an open mind to highly offensive racial jokes and raunchy one liners. Cheers!
This show is amazing!! It's loaded with laughter, talent and excitement. It's pretty heavy on its sexual vocabulary so be mindful of who you go with. Best show in Vegas for sure!! I've seen almost all of the shows in vegas, none of which I'd see again, except this one!!! I could go again and again! The 2 host are hilarious and unforgettable, you'll be laughing for days!!! Enjoy!!
read all the yelp reviews and went to see this show. amazing!!! wonderful!!  a  must see!!
Easily the most unique show in Las Vegas.  If cursing, racial stereotypes, or vulgar descriptions of sexual situations makes you queazy, then I would stay clear of this show.  However, if that type of comedy and entertainment if right up your alley, you won't find a better show.  When I sat back and thought about it, there probably isn't another show in town that can compare.  My group and I all LOVED it and laughed throughout.  It is almost unnecessarily vulgar and gratuitous at times but that was part of what made it so funny.  You almost can't believe what they are saying/doing and can see other people looking visibly uncomfortable.. . Absinthe is located in a tent in front of Caesar's Palace.  It is not a huge venue so I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  Everyone is right on top of the action which adds to the excitement.  Being a few feet away from a man spinning around on roller skates holding a woman from his neck is exhilarating and scary at the same time.  Absinthe is also unique because of the crowd interaction.  The host or "Gazzilionaire" as I think he was called plays a lot off of the crowd...so depending on who is in attendance, the show could very from performance to performance.. . One tip...if you aren't someone who has poor vision or absolutely HAS to sit up front, I wouldn't worry about going for a cheaper ticket option and sitting further away.  We had the most expensive ticket which included a (very small) bottle of champagne and ended up in about the 3rd row I think.
Freaking hilarious.. . Don't take your mom, or your kid (even over 18), or anyone conservative.. . The comedy was so over-the-top gratuitous, but I thought it was extremely funny and shocking. The lady next to me looked uncomfortable and unimpressed, so everyone has their own opinion. Some reviewers have faulted the Penny character, but she was a crack-up and not someone I will soon forget. The boyfriend and I have been quoting her randomly for days.. . I didn't love the singing fairy, or the strip-teases, but the comedy and acrobatics made up for all of that. . . I'm a huge fan of Cirque. I've seen almost every show since their very first (in the late 80's/early 90's?), but I have to admit that although their acrobatics are stunning, I've fallen asleep on a couple occasions (mostly due to food coma, etc., but still). There was no chance of me falling asleep in this production, and it was a good time all around.
Oh my God! This show was fucking hysterical!  Undoubtedly the best show in Vegas.. . i walked in not knowing anything about the show and hence having no preconceived notions.  It turned out to be part Cirque De Solai and part stand up comedy. . . The performers and acrobats were  unbelievable... bordering on inhuman.  But honestly, it was the little short red headed girl that stole the show.  The emcee was also quite funny... kind of a Borat rip off but still funny as hell.. . the whole show had strong sexual overtones ... well, fuck.. honestly?  It was outright obscene, but seeing such politically incorrect humor in our present society was refreshing.. . There are no bad seats at this show.  Go see it!!
SO. HILARIOUS. I was crying with laughter.. . Definitely not for prudes, or those who are offended easily.. . Despite being much cheaper than a Cirque show (it's just under $100, and cheaper if you book in advance), it combines all the shows you could see in Vegas under one Spiegeltent: stand-up, acrobatics (with various acts, featuring strength, tumbling, and partner work), variety performance (roller skaters, tightrope), and burlesque. Since I was only in town for a few days, this was perfect since I only really had time to catch one show.. . 100% satisfaction. Would definitely recommend.
Absolutely the show to see! I have seen it twice. I love it because it's funny. Penny makes me laugh with her puppet show. I love the roller skating act and the high wire act. The girl in the bubble is adorable. The talent acts are impressive- I am speechless every time. This is a mix of a Cirque style, Burlesque, and Comedy show all in one. I was never bored for a minute. I like the small circus style feel of this theater. My only complaint is that the seats aren't comfortable. I would probably see this show a third time in Vegas. It has been one of my favorite shows in Vegas. It's a unique show and yes- it's pretty vulgar so it's not for everyone. We had a girls weekend and all 4 of us loved it! Two of us in the group have seen the show twice and we both raved about it.
Hilarious show... not your father's Oldsmobile. Great acts and audience participation. Loved the arial act with the Chinese and redhead so strong, smooth and artistic!
I had read several Yelp! reviews about this show before purchasing tickets...so was fully aware what I was getting myself into...but let me tell you, that it exceeded my expectations and was the most HYSTERICAL show I have ever seen.  I think what is so fabulous about this show is that it combines SO MANY "Vegas" aspects into one....cirque-type acts, comedy, Burlesque.... . My husband and our friends have not laughed this hard in a VERY, VERY, VERY long time..... . If you do not have a great sense of humor, or are easily offended, or don't like cursing, inappropriate humor, etc. this show is not for you. . . It was a great evening and we will definitely see it again on our next trip!
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!. . Cirque meets Rocky Horror Picture show...the acts are amazing and the skits are hilarious.... . Not for the easily offended but you will NOT be sorry you went to this show.
When in vegas, watch this show!
HOLY COW!  I'm not sure that I have ever laughed this hard, our Absinthe show experience was the highlight of our Vegas trip.. . As so many others have mentioned, this show is about as vulgar as vulgar gets -- within the first 5 minutes of the show pretty much the entire first 2 rows had been the butt of the most non-PC jokes (and physical demonstrations of certain punchlines to those jokes) imaginable.  And they were glorious.  But not for the even remotely offended by anything, seriously.. . The acts themselves were breathtaking - a couple in particular that left a far greater impression than any Cirque show I've ever seen.  Given how close the audience is to the stage, it's quite clear (particularly with the rocking roller routine, hot damn) that a single slip would most likely take out a few sets of teeth in the first few rows.  Nail biting.  . . The venue is cozy and quirky - but do get ready to sit on hard wooden folding chairs bumping elbows with your neighbor.  But you probably won't notice as the time just flies and you'll be laughing too hard to care.. . Go to this.  Seriously.  Your face will hurt from laughing non-stop.
Do you want to laugh your butt off? Do you find talented humans entertaining? Do you like unique? If you answered yes to any/all of these questions; then you MUST see Absinthe. I look forward to taking as many friends and family with lewd senses of humor to watch this so they can cry as they laugh just like we did.
The show was A M A Z I N G. Better than all the Cirque shows combined. This is a show that does not need special effects. It is all human feat/vulgarity. Something you could have seen a 100 years ago. The vulgarity works as the show does not spare any race/class/orientation/diet/age/size. . . If there was a downside it would be that some were laughing so hard it was hurting my eardrums.. . And the worst seats are still great. In saying that, get as close to the front as you can.
FIRST OFF, I am NOT into Circus Ole type shows but my wife is always wanting to go. The Last min Ticket people talked us into it and we were staying across the street. . . I must say....GREAT SHOW! Very funny, sexy and very entertaining! . . DOWNFALL: The seats are to close to each other and not comfortable at all.  Most people not even fat people cant fully sit on one seat without overflowing to another seat. We lucked out and was moved to the back which worked out way better. We sat in a bathtub which ended up being awesome. We didn't miss a thing and didn't mind it at all. . . RECOMMEND: Paying for VIP where the seats move or Sit in Back area!
Hilarious!!!
Since I'm a huge fan of Cirque shows, this was a definitely comedic relief from the others. This was ongoing jokes and laughing. My bf even laughed at me when I said "don't do it" because of the close proximity to everything and everyone!. . The decor inside is cutesy and overall it gets very intimate. I just wished that they wouldn't allow photography inside because the man sitting in front of my seat was pointing his camera up above his head for a majority of the show. It was annoying and if I had more guts I probably would've taken that camera and had the Gazillionaire step on it. . . The audience participation was awesome too since even the Gazillionaire seemed surprised.
Holy smokes.. why didn't I see this show the last time I was in Vegas?!. . I loved this show ...and I wasn't drunk or high as someone suggested in another review BUT but you do have to have an open mind and a good sense of humor so be warned. ;-) The acts are really unique and admittedly some are kitshy and silly but they do get ya laughing and are unlike anything you''ll see elsewhere in Vegas. . . Also, we were worried about being cold as the show is in a tent but it was nice and warm inside.  Just a tip ... we found $25 off coupons on some of the online vegas discount sites and we also saw it listed at the TCKTS booth for the same $25 off so don't pay full price when ya don't have to.
I thought this show was incredible!  I've been to several Cirque shows and appreciated the satire Absinthe brings to the table.  I also loved the off-color humor.  I was worried it would be too much, but, it wasn't even a fraction of the raunchy stuff you would hear at a comedy show and it's a lot more clever.  I also thought the Penny character was pretty great.. . My one complaint - why does no one cheer?  We got moved to the front row (the house was only like 1/3rd full) and I'm so happy we did (but half of the front was empty because people didn't want to move - weird).  Anyway, does anyone understand how hard this stuff is?  The performers want to know you appreciate them!  My husband and I were pretty much the only ones clapping and cheering - it was so noticeable that a spouse of a performer found us and thanked us for being good audience members after the show.. . And like most people mentioned, you can get discounted tix. They're all around the same price on various websites and the tickets booths around town.
I'd give this show even more stars if I could!!! They alternate between spectacular physical feats and raunchy over the top humor. Occasionally they combine the two. One second we were getting misty eyed watching a love-themed aerial ballet, the next we were laughing so hard we thought we were going to fall out of our chairs. Do not come to this show if you don't have a sense of humor!!! We were warned about the folding chairs but didn't even notice because the show was so great and the people squeezed into the seats surrounding us were very cool. This is a must-see!
I have seen all the Vegas shows and this one is the best.  If you do not like sex or swearing then don't go.  The funniest and up close show in Vegas.
Just saw this show again after a year and we still love it. I thought some of the jokes were improved but they were, but it was still just as funny. Still the #1 show in Vegas in my opinion.
Go see this show... not for those who do not appreciate a sarcarstic and wicked humor.  They are irreverent and audacious.  Their jokes are very raw... but I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  All the seats are good, but if you can, spend for the VIP or VVIP, you will be glad that you did.
I've seen the show 3 times in the last year....so I know what I'm talking about!. . Cirque Cirque Cirque..blah blah blah borrrrinnnnngg.  I've left every Cirque show I've seen thinking, "All the acrobatics were cool but what the hell is going on?"  It's a dream?  Okay, well it's not my dream so I don't get it.  Not that way with Absinthe.  The show is really a Variety Act, so to compare it to Cirque may be a little apples to oranges...so what, the show is funny and who doesn't need a little laughter these days?!. . The acts include the high wire, strong man, trapeze, sexy roller skating, etc.  Pretty standard, and as usual, pretty impressive.  What I like here is that all of the performers are nice and attractive with all of the girls wearing skimpy outfits and great smiles.. . In between the acts two raunchy hosts roll the crowd with X-rated, racist, and hilarious banter.  If you don't like fun, men in tights, or sock puppets having sex, this might not be the show for you.. . This is one of only three shows that I ever recommend to out of town friends.. . If you are a local resident, visit the kiosk outside of Ceasars for $75 tickets.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!! This is a MUST see. I was a little unsure of a fairly expensive show In a tent, but I was laughing so hard pretty much the entire time, i forgot i was in a tent. The acts are amazing, and I loved the crude humor and language.  I would give it more stars if I could. . My only complaint was the bitchy usher I would have liked to punch HER in the face with her obnoxious mouth yelling for people to line up single file and telling people she has had enough of them. Shut up, it's your job to deal with people. Go learn how to walk on a tight rope if you don't want to seat people.
See this show!. . I hope as this show's popularity grows, it's audience doesn't.  Put yourself in the circus side show era of traveling gypsy tents and fun.  The show is neither for the faint of heart, nor placid of tongue.  If you get offended easily, go see Jersey Boys.  If you want to see a show that you'll not only remember, but want to see again; see Absinthe.  I can only assume you should get your tickets as early as you can, as this budding venue will begin to sell out fast.  . . P.S. there's not a bad seat in the tent.  Go!  What are you waiting for?  Get tickets!
BEST SHOW!  If you can handle an adult show full up foul language, crazy circus stunts and a lot of sexual tension- you will LOVE Absinthe. The audience is seated up close wrapping around the stage- cross your fingers a stunt doesn't mess up! Yes, you're that close. The Hosts of the show were hilarious- the girl reminded me of Cheri Oteri. Even if its the same show ever night- I will see this again!!
This was Absinthe star and burlesque singer Melody Sweets debut album show. Magnificence occured. Absinthe is "As Good As It Gets". The Star and burlesque performer is performing her own music almost nightly. Spectacular world-class acrobatics combine with up-close views for heart stopping action. Comedic MC the Gazilionaire takes offense to a new low, while Penny Pibbets his side-sick sock puppet Queen help keep it extremely inappropriate. In a world of politically correct the fact that they're doing hilarious raunchy material like this made me proud. We have to laugh or we'll cry at life. This show is addictive, warning. You may stalk the stars on twitter, and wish to join the circus once you attend. You also may get pulled onstage to do things as I did. I'm pretty outgoing and even I was a little embarassed by Gaz's request to kiss a republican wife who I"d never met. It was fucking awesome though. I couldn't really love a show more, and it's been voted best show in Vegas for two years, and is contracted through at least Oct. 2013 at Ceaser's Roman Plaza with whispers of 2014. Personally, I hope the show goes on forever and ever. It renewed my faith in humanity. We can all have fun and not take things too seriously after all.
This is the best show that we have ever seen in Vegas !! likely the best show we have ever seen.  it is set up as a (fake) side show. The show is insanely funny and full of amazing stunts that put Cirque du Soleil to shame. The show takes place in a tent with a very small stage and the chairs go right up to the stage. the venue is small so don't bother spending the money on upgraded tickets every seat is a good seat. This is a must see show if you are in Vegas.
Absolute riot of a show. . . The show has sexual, political and racist humor intermixed with some really stunning acrobatics. . . It is amongst my most recommended things in Vegas. The humor was definitely inducing laughter, the acrobatics was outstanding (amplified opinion because of the view from close quarters). The humor with the racist and political hues was also very very funny. The participants from the crowd also had a ball of a time during their brief sojourn up on stage. . . Overall - excellent show. Strongly recommended.
DO NOT GO SEE THIS SHOW..... . OK, so I know it's rude to type in caps lock.  And you are saying "hey, wait, he gave it 5 stars and said don't go to this show".  And you would be right.  Do not go see this show..... . 1) if you have absolutely no sense of humor. 2) if you can't appreciate true talent. 3) if politically incorrect humor offends you. 4) if you would rather sit around with you thumb up your ass being bored. . How to explain Absinthe?  Think vaudeville meets medicine show meets Rocky Horror meets South Park.  I know, that's a lot to take in.  And that kinda sums it up.  I don't want to give away too many details, but let me suffice it to say, this was hands down the BEST show my son and I have ever seen.  We simply could not stop raving about it.  One moment you will be laughing so hard that you will be crying and then before you know it, your jaw will be on the floor and you will say "wow, I can't believe I just saw that."   . . The venue (a small 'big-top style tent) is intimate and literally puts you right in the action.  The only small complaint is the small wooden seats aren't very comfortable, but it lends to the authenticity of the traveling sideshow.. . With all the choices for entertainment in Vegas, it is sometimes hard to decide where to spend your spend you money.  Let me make this very easy for you...GO SEE ABSINTHE!!!!!
Absolutely fantastic show.  . . As a local this is one of the only shows in Las Vegas I have ever paid to see and would pay to see again.  . . While it is on the expensive side for tickets there isn't a bad seat in the house as the show is done in the round in a very small tent.  Performances are sometimes uncomfortably close, which makes them even more entertaining when done well.  . . The variety act nature of the show is glued together by the "producer" very well leading to a smooth pacing for the entire show.  There was only one section in the entire 90 minutes that seemed to run long.. . All in all this a great show that is very well produced and worth every penny of the ticket price.
i am still laughing from this show. it was such an amazing experience. When I wasnt awed by the amazing acts in front of me I was laughing so hysterically at the host and his assistant. Also the interaction with the audience is bar none. Even the host looked like he didnt know what was going on at one point with the audience and it all played out so well. Great great great show!! Nor for kids though :)
What a great show!  This show was for people the might like Cirque de Soleil acts if it wasn't for the seriousness and the music. This is funny, sexy and entertaining.  It is an upclose experience which really heightens the effect of the acts.  This is a must see show (with spouse or not).  It's really for someone that doesn't like most shows but wants to be entertained and laugh.
Take your girlfriend or your boyfriend...past that NO family members...this was the most raunchy, unpolitically correct, absolutely jaw on the floor, wide eyed "did he just SAY that?" show I have ever been to...ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL.  I would pay cash money to see it again...and again!
The best show ever, I've seen it twice in the last year. It was slightly different the second time but it was just as amazing, and some performances were actually better. . . This show is a compilation of crazy acrobatics, some burlesque, singing, dancing, parody, comedy and lots of obscene humor. Racist, sexist, and all jokes are made and all are hilarious. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but don't bring kids or anyone that offends easily.
Absinthe - I LOVE YOU! (not the drink, but the show) They did have a bar, so maybe they give drinks with Absinthe in it as well... I wouldn't be surprised ;-). . Anyway, I was looking for a good show to go to with my boyfriend and I really wanted to do a Cirque Du Soleil show after seeing Le Reve when I was there last time, but they are all so expensive, so I ended up keeping this one in mind. I think any show in Vegas is a great show, so it really doesn't matter, but can I just say how incredibly happy I am that we went here!?!. . I strolled down early in the morning to the grounds of Caesars Palace because that's where my friend told me they sell the tix. I didn't know this, but there was a guy giving out coupons for the show just a few feet away from the ticket booth, so keep that in mind, however, the girl ended up giving me a discount regardless! . . It was Valentine's day, so we had a really nice dinner at a Sushi restaurant at Caesars, then made our way down to where this tent is parked right near Serendipity 3. From the outside, it looks like a crappy Circus tent, so I was thinking.. "oh boy, what did we get ourselves into?!" But once you enter, it's an entirely different feeling. The only crappy thing I can think of was the wooden chairs that were hard to sit on and the columns that hold up the tent, since they were blocking my view, otherwise it was all just amazing! . . The best way to describe Absinthe is that it's a mix of crazy things you can see in Vegas on any given day, but with an insanely hilarious twist of comedy and some damn good acrobatics!  Or as they have it on their website, "a acro-cabaret variety show." Just like many Yelpers mentioned, you really need to be open minded or have a sense of humor, otherwise, you will get offended. We were laughing to the point of our faces hurting for hours after the show. . . There is no point on giving away details, but I whole heartily recommend seeing Absinthe. For the money, you get way more than your average show, and with memories to last a lifetime! I will DEF see this again, hopefully in the near future.
My favorite show in Las Vegas. Ditch the formalities and actually enjoy a fun show. Money well spent!
So F***ing good; can't even explain just how good this show is. Never laughed so hard, even at comedy clubs. The Gazillionaire is one of the greatest Characters you'll ever meet! Reminds me of a circus ring-master in some dirty sideshow out in a desert trailer park. Hilarious! A few audience members are targets of his raunchy jokes and go on stage. Funny watching the older people in the audience with all the blunt sexual stuff they talk about; it's great!!! The acrobatic acts are preformed in such a small, intimate little tent/ theater that you are warned not to stand at some points. You sit close with your neighbor so putaside claustrophobia. You can get deals on this show during the day in front of Caesars, or online, but even at full-price this is worth it! Definitely going again soon.
One of my favorite shows on the strip! The seating is general admission so you can sit wherever you want! Beware though if you sit in the front-you might become part of the show. ;) I would recommend going with close friends or a significant other. This show can be raunchy and might be awkward if you go with family. Not a kid show. This is show really is hilarious. If you aren't conservative and want a good laugh I really recommend you check this show out! You will be laughing throughout the entire show.
I have seen Absinthe twice. Both times were absolutely amazing! This show is an 18+ performance and I would not not recommend taking your parents. This is great for dates and for groups.
The seating is general admission - so you can choose where to experience the show! Sit up close! The language may be to salty for an older demographic, but myself (22) and other I went with (30s) had a really fun time.
I would go back to see this show and plan on going again in June.  . Seeing this show was probably the best experience I had on my last trip to Las Vegas.. The show is located in a tent on the Caesar's property.  It's very close to Serendipity.. All I can say is hilarious!!  I laughed so hard!  I honestly think this is why the chairs are not padded.  This is not the show for you if you are easily offended.  They are certainly equal opportunity when it comes to making fun of everyone.  The Gazillionaire is the host and Penny (I love you!!) is his sidekick.  They are so funny, I could watch these two all night.  The acts are all very entertaining but the roller skating act was amazing!  Roller skating and Muse?  What else is there?. We went on a Friday night and there were plenty of seats, mostly in the back.  I am short and had a hard time seeing with the tall man in front of me, but one of my friends offered his seat so I could see better.. See this show!!
MUST GO!!!. First show ever in vegas for me and it was beyond incredible! I went with a group of friends and spontaneously decided to watch Absinthe and we were pretty lucky that there were still tickets left 3 hrs before the show! . If you can't decide on which seats to pick, I high suggest choosing the last row because its elevated and you really do get the best view! The back row really isn't far from the stage considering the whole place is fairly small and because its elevated you get to see everything literally and you wont be cramped among people with tiny chairs. . The show is absolutely hilarious! Must go if you want to enjoy a good "I cant stop laughing" show in vegas!!. you will NOT regret!
More like 4.6 stars, because the wooden seats are so painful...but to this day...the Vegas experience I reminisce on most fondly!  Words can't describe the magic of Absinthe.  From the moment I walked in and some girl puked on the floor, I knew this was going to be one of the most amazing moments of my life.  I've been to the City of Sin like, 4 times since, and walking past that Spegeltent always brings a tear to my eye. I love it when I go to a show and feel offended at the end, but also in total awe.  I'd bring my mom to this show...but only because she's probably cooler than your mom and I don't care what she thinks she loves me regardless.  The Gazillionaire is the perfect man, I'm jealous of Angel Porrino, and yes, I'd do it again in a heartbeat!
This is the best show on the strip, hands down. The venue is amazing, it's smaller than other theaters on the strip but that's part of what makes it so great. You have to have to HAVE to go see this show. It really lives up to the hype. I've seen this show 3 times and it has amazed me all 3. There's always been something new or different about it, from the costumes to the actual acts themselves, Absinthe definitely knows how to keep it fresh and lively. Not to mention, there is plenty of crowd interaction, which makes the entire experience even more intimate and hilarious. If you're uptight about, well, anything, you may be offended a few times; but if you're a person who enjoys laughing til hurts, insane acts, and insanely good-looking and talented artists, Absinthe is a MUST SEE!
Just got back from Las Vegas......Saw Mystere Cirque du Soleil and Absinthe. . . Absinthe was in my opinion the better show by far. . . All other good reviews are spot on in terms of content as we checked yelp before going to the show. . . Penny steals the show....
GO SEE IT! I was very impressed by this variety show, it has a little bit of everything and takes it to the next level.. . The only thing I recommend is don't take anyone you won't be comfortable hearing SUPER sexual jokes around and go into the show with a really good sense of humor. It is very crude, but it all in jest. Although, I could have done with out a few of the dick jokes.
Awesome show.  Very talented performers.   If you are offended by the the words F*&#, S*^$, or A$$h@!%,  You may not want to see this show.   If you do not want to get blasted by the Gazillionaire, DO NOT sit in the front row.    Would definetly see again.
Great awesome show!! Not for the kids though, so leave them at Circus Circus. Small intimate venue, so all the seats are up close and personal. The various acts were spectacular! Definitely different from all the Cirque shows. Jokes are pretty raunchy, but they were hilarious. So if you get offended easily... this might not be the best show for you.. . I've seen many shows on the strip, and this ranks among my favorite. If you want to wait until day of the show, sometimes they have workers handing out $20 off coupons in front of the box office which I think is the best deal ($69/ticket instead of regular price $89). Or you can also get discount tickets on Vegas.com
HILARIOUS!. This show keeps you laughing and on the edge of your seat at the same time.. The comedian hosts are raunchy and hilarious and all of the acts are incredible.. The best new show on the strip!
Not your usual PC boring venue. Amazing experience great performers, host, music audience participation were all perfect. Blows a lot of the other big budget strip shows out of the water.  . . I would totally go see this again!!
How freaking fun was this?! . . First, don't even think about going with anyone that you aren't comfortable discussing the details of your sex life with. There are parts of the show that wouldn't be out of place as the closed captioning on porn, if that was a thing. If you're still with me, read on:. . A tip: if you sit in the front row, be prepared to be picked on mercilessly! The ringmaster, the Gazillionaire, uses raunchy, completely un-PC humor, which I found fantastic! He and Penny were awesome, providing endless laughs. Like laughs so hard you cry. . . But the humor tends to take a backseat to the insane acts. I'm pretty sure my jaw was on the floor for a significant amount of the show. I think all the acts are made all the more impressive by the teeny, tiny theater. I found myself making eye contact with so many of the performers, they were so close! . . Go, go, go, right now!
I loved this show.  It was the most entertaining that I've see in Vegas.  I'd describe it as Borat meets cirque du soleil.  As scores of others have said, if you are easily offended or of a conservative religious background, steer clear.  Stick with the O fluff next door at Bellagio.  However, if you laugh at crude but smart stand up a la Chris Rock, Richard Prior, early Eddie Murphy, etc, you will love this show.  . . My wife and I were lucky enough to attend the 1000th show.  Unbeknownst to us, it would turn into the zombie apocalypse after-party.  Free drinks, food, and professional make-up artists doing everyone up as zombies.  Rad!  Oh, and taking a shot of absinthe from the ice sculpture of Penny was a once-in-a-lifetime photo op.. . The show itself was remarkable.  Raunchy, hilarious banter back and forth between the players, transitioning to the typical acts of strength, balance and agility.  The cool thing is, it's a very small venue and you really get a sense for how talented the performers are.  Unlike Cirque, where you are back from the stage (cheap seats) and over-stimulated by flying freaks, Absinthe focuses intimately on one thrilling act at a time.  . . I will be back to this show the next time I'm in Vegas, for SURE.  Going out partying afterwards made up as a zombie made for a memorable night on the town.  A+++ for the whole experience.  My stomach hurt for days from all the laughing.  Check your morals at the door and take a big shot of Absinthe!!!
I don't remember the last time I've laughed so hard!  This is definitely not a show for every one but if you've got an ounce of humor running through your bones it definitely wouldn't hurt to give it a try.  Seating is kind of tight but it's a little price you pay for a unique experience.  Also, if your wallet's up for it, splurge a little for front row seating.  Totally worth it!
This is hands down the best show I have EVER SEEN. Did VVIP and it was so worth the extra money. Just incredible.
I absolutely love this show!! Entertaining is an understatement. This is an all adult show. It is an intimate setting inside of a tent right outside of Caesars Palace. Seating can be a bit uncomfortable since it's on wooden fold out chairs. As other reviews have said if you are easily offended do NOT book this show, go elsewhere. However, if you're open minded and in for a great time with some crude humor and obscene tactics get the tickets you need. QUICKLY! :)
Best show ever.  The prior description of Borat meets Cirque du Soleil is quite accurate.  Front row is well worth it - so long as you don't mind being part of the show.
The best!
Forget about Cirque Du Soleil, that's for old grannies..  . If you're young, drunk and stupid going to Vegas (and let's be honest, who isn't) than this is the show you need to see!. . Hilarious dark extremely none politically correct humor, awesome in-your-face circus act and a super intimate setting makes this show a thrill.. . 5 stars!
This show is not for the faint of heart! If you're offended by raunchy humour involving graphic sex, racial slurs, and political incorrectness, this show is not for you.. . My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this show - a great change from Cirque du Soleil. They pack you into a little tent outside of Caesar's Palace, and from there the show is a mix of acrobatics, burlesque, and in-your-face, dirty comedy. I love that they are as inappropriate as possible - and incorporate the audience. We were sitting in the 4th row, and the performances are right there. I'm talking about tightrope walkers literally right over your head.. . I would probably not recommend this show to my parents, although there were some in their 50's and 60's - the target audience is 21+ and most seemed to be in their 30's.
This show is awesome if you like circus acts, offensive humor and burlesque. The performances are great and Penny and the Gazillionaire are comedic gold! . . I actually got pulled up on stage for a lap dance-off and won a free drink of Absinthe!!!. To the Asian woman I scarred for life, I am sorry....not really.  . . I'd recommend this show to anyone young or old who isnt easily offended...
My boyfriend and I scoffed at the "If you only see one show in your entire life, make it Absinthe" quote plastered all over the posters. I thought, "Ehh...probably a bunch of Cirque rejects." The Absinthe performers quickly shut me the fuck up. Oh what silly little bitches we are.. . Best show I've seen...EVER!. . If you haven't picked up on this yet from other reviews, the show is indeed raunchy and vulgar which can equate to either highly entertaining or offensive depending on your sense of humor. If there is anything you are even remotely insecure about, do not sit in the front sections because the Gazillionaire will call you out about it in front of everyone in such a hilarious, quick-witted way that you might even end up laughing at yourself. You will laugh almost non-stop during the entire show!. . The only time you will not be laughing is when your jaw drops open in complete awe of the performances. These performers are ridiculously strong and talented! I should have never doubted them. And with the venue so small and intimate, they are right in front of you. So close, in fact, that if they were to fall, they would land right on top of the audience. The only thing I didn't get was the girl in the bubble, but my boyfriend later explained to me, "She was an oiled up girl with pasties...what don't you get?". . I have zero complaints. None. Will see it again. I'm so glad we walked by that guy handing out $20 off coupons in front of Caesar's Palace. The show was a last minute addition to our plans and it ended up being one of the most memorable parts of our trip.
Absinthe comes highly recommended! Quite possibly one of the best (and most affordable) shows on the strip.. . This cabaret style show is the perfect balance of cirque (and by cirque I mean circus), comedy and variety show. The Gazillionaire is your Master of Ceremonies / ringleader for the evening. You'll come to love the grease and slime of his swagger. And his sidekick Penny Pibbets is so cute and adorable the sexual outbursts won't bother you a bit. The execution of all the curse words, sexual innuendos, racist jokes and back flips is so entertaining you won't find it the least bit offensive. And if you do--too bad. Your not getting your money back so you should probably mope back to your hotel room and grow a sense of humor.. . On top of the laughs, the flippy bits and various circus acts are thoroughly entertaining. However, there was a strange one involving Angel Porrino and a bubble that I couldn't quite wrap my head around. I've seen the show thrice and I look forward to all the outlandish wackiness every time I go. (Thanks to my friends for hooking it up with tickets) but I would pay actual dinero to see this show myself. Its under $100 and probably the best bang for your buck show on the strip. Suitable for both men and women. Maybe not mom & dad--unless you just hang with your parents like that.. . This is entertainment gold my friends. If you can only see one show in Vegas, see Absinthe. As long as you're not wicked conservative or shudder at the slightest bit of obscenity, i.e. a total prude, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself and laugh for so long  you'll waltz out of here with aching absand lifted spirits.
Absinthe was hilarious!! Extraordinary talent, amazing, sexy, unique and I loved it.
This is probably one of the best shows in Vegas. Its located outside by Ceasar's main registration area. Serendipity is also a few steps away from the location. I'm so happy that we got tickets and they were half priced. The tent is not as large as Cirque's traveling shows but it its more intimate. Our seats were only 4 rows from the stage. The humor is dark and the performances are as good as any other big budgeted shows. The Gazillionaire and the assistant really took the show to another level. Literally everyone in the show were falling off their seats because they couldn't stop laughing. THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR KIDS!!!  They cuss, the performances are raw, shows a lot of skin and this whats makes this acrobatic show different from any other. Love it and will watch it again and again everytime I visit Vegas!
Loved! Was there on Sat. night and after seeing all the reviews my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. It was amazing. I hadn't laughed so hard in months I literally had tears coming out. The place is small so it doesn't matter where you sit. We actually got 25 dollars on each ticket by browsing online and looking for promo codes we ended up paying 70 dollars per ticket vs. 95 for the 10:30 showing at half price tickets boots inthe strip. We bought our tickets at Ticketmaster with the promo code. Highly recommend this show.
One of, if not my favorite shows in Vegas. My wife and I sat in the second row and I felt like I was so close I could have reached out and touched the performers. In fact, I think they ask the first row to not sand up during the performances for laibility reasons. The show is a good mix of pretty amazing "Cirque" like performances and over the top comedy. The comedy, while often laugh out loud hilarious, can also be a little offensive. As others have said the only negative here is that if you are easily offended you most likely will be here.
This show was awesome! If you're into adult, raunch comedy, this show is for you! It's a mix of comedy and acrobatics. I'm so glad we ran into a couple who told us about the show! We would have never known about it!. . It's held in a small, circular tent, and there really isn't a bad seat, unless you're sitting behind someone tall.. . We had a great, fun time, and I would highly recommend it! The show isn't kid friendly, so viewers need to do their homework. As I mentioned though, if you like adult humor, you'll love it!
I LOVED it, I seriously think it is the best show I have seen in Vegas, however it is not for everybody.. . The show is REALLY raunchy, and could be uncomfortable for certain people I am sure. The ringmaster makes fun of people in the audience (racial, sexual orientation, etc.) and we saw some people leaving because it was so out there, but if you are not offended by that kind of humor then you are probably fine.. . It is a fairly small venue and I will say you are uncomfortably close to the people next to you and the seats are just uncomfy on their own, but still totally worth it, imo.. . The acrobatic acts, were all just awesome. Very talented people and some things I had never seen before. Plus you are very close so that adds some excitement. . . Penny was adorable and HYSTERICAL, with her totally inappropriate sexual stories and her back and forth with the Ringmaster, she was my favorite by far. We were still talking about her days later, her character in that show is just perfect.. . All in all, I thought it was a fabulous show, and tons of fun :-)
This is my favorite show on the strip. I have seen it 3 times and will go back every time I have new friends come to visit. It is raunchy and racist. It is so very offensive. I am a strong believer that it is only funny if somebody is offended. The acts are top notch.  My only complaint would be that the chairs are uncomfortable. My butt hurt from sitting on them. Also it is very cramped so if you are overweight you may not fit in the chairs unless you buy 2.
I was in town for business and we were working really long days.  On Friday we were able to get tickets to the 8pm show, and I'm SO glad we did!  It's truly a delightful show - raunchy but super fun.  If you're easily offended you may want to think twice, but it really was quite funny and the acrobatics are amazing!
AMAZING!!!!!. . hm, where to start?! . We live in California & travel to Vegas at least 4 - 5 times a year.. . Ive been to many shows, many cirque de soiles ( not only in vegas) and they are great!. . But ABSINTHE, IS AMAZING!. . . I think because you get both comedy and circus acts is really what makes the show.. . I love ooing and aaing at circus acts, but come on, you know during a circus show there are times where your just thinking " is this almost over ?!" .... . Not with Absinthe!. . You get the circus acts, with the mix of funny raunchy bad comedy ( the best comedy) lol. . Penny defiantly was my favorite!! She is so cute and hilarious. . . There isnt much nudity, they cover up the nipples :). . GO WATCH IT!!!!
I loved this show.  I laughed so hard I cried.  We were in the VIP front row. There are no bad seats.  This is a must. The main guy is so funny and his side kick gal. You must have an open mind and not be easily offended. It's out their. They pick on every one and every thing. It's adults only. No kids.  The show is amazing.  You must go.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.  If you get the VIP seats you get to walk n via the phone booth.  Funny, funny, funny.  BTW the main singer is gorgeous.  Loved everything about it
Hosted by very funny and inappropriate comedians. Great for a fun night in Vegas!
This show is F*&#KING AMAZING!!! We stumbled on this show walking back to Caesars one day.  From the outside, it looks like Circus Vargas just set up tent in Caesars front yard but inside, it's well decorated and thoughtfully planned out.  . . The best way that I can describe this show is that it's one part Cirque du Solei, one part burlesque and 10 parts raunchy comedy.  If you are easily offended, don't do it.  This show is for the thick skinned people that can take racial, sexual and completely off colored jokes. And don't bring your kids here. . . The tent itself is small so it's an intimate venue.  The stage is circular and there are no bad seats in the house.  There are actors walking and running around everywhere and you are close enough to touch them (but please don't).  There are plenty of hot actors/dancers in the show and there's plenty of skin showing. Think more burlesque and less Spearmint Rhino.  . . Out of all the shows that I have seen in Vegas, this is definitely one of my top ones.  You will definitely laugh your ass off and set the tone for an awesome evening afterwards.
Without a doubt, the BEST show in Vegas. Hilarious and jaw dropping every second off the show. Thoroughly impressed with the entire cast. Not for those that offend easily. Amazing and underrated.
MUST SEE!!!! I would go see again and have been telling everyone how fabulous the show is.
'Bashes face in wall' GAH I love this show so much! I got to see it when it had its' one year stay at Caesars, and then again after it officially became a show there. I do have to say that the first time I saw it was a bit better than the second:. . The first time we went they had the outside of the tent decorated with lights, awesome furniture, trees and a bar. It was really cool, and since back then it was first come first serve in seats, we had to line up, and it was nice to stand and look at all the cool things they had out. They also had a phone booth that they took VIPs through- the person got in, picked up the phone, and then a secret door opened and they went inside. I thought that was pretty darn awesome. They also had a different act- the rollerbladers! These two did a scary move where the guy held onto the girls hands and spun around so fast- if he had let go she would have gone into the crowd and killed someone.. . The second time we went the outside was bare. Totally bare. There is nothing there to indicate that there's even a show there besides the big white tent. It's really sad, and kinda off-putting. They now have seat numbers for you, or at least we did. The rollerbladers left and were replaced with a lady and a bubble, who is pretty cool herself, but not nearly as life threatening.. . The show itself is amazing, but yes, full of curse words and sexual situations. Don't like curse words? Don't feel comfortable with your sexuality? DO NOT GO THEN. Go see a sterile Cirque show if you can't handle being an adult. There's plenty of Cirque like stunts- but FAR better because IT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Way better in my opinion.
Phenomenal, hilarious, wildly entertaining!. . This is probably THE BEST Vegas show I've been to thus far, and everyone I know who has seen it agrees wholeheartedly.. . This show is Zumanity to the nth degree!  If you're looking for sexy, it's sexier!  If you're looking for funny, it's funnier!  If you're looking for amazing, it's...amazing-er!. . Absinthe is a comedic, theatrical, and acrobatic show all rolled into one.  Also, the close quarters (it's in a tiny tent outside Caesar's Palace) makes the show an exciting and unique experience.  There is literally not a bad seat in the house.  However, being up close does have its oogling benefits, if you know what I mean.  (Becareful of not being so close that they include you as part of the show, lol...you know...unless you're into that kind of thing!). . My boyfriend saw it the first time with his friend and immediately wanted to take me to go see it for my first time.  It was freaking awesome!. . DISCLAIMER:  This show is not for the easily-offended as it contains fabulously vulgar and sexual content.
This show is amazing! its funny, entertaining (a bit raunchy) but overall a great time. I don't get offended easily so I found it wildly amusing. However, I could see my mom may get offended by some of the things they say and do. If you haven't seen this then its a must when coming to Vegas, but leave your judgement at the door.
Hubby and I were at the CES show in January and decided to go see this show. What a show! It wss, hands down, one of the most funniest show we've ever seen! It has comedy snd lots of acrobatic action. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard.  This show uses a lot of dirty words and a lot of politically incorrect language. So if you're easily offended,  then this show is not for you. Overall,  the only thing I didn't like were the hard wooden seats and the tight seating for the audience.
Hilarious, genius, and acrobatically/gymnastically jaw dropping. A must see in Vegas.
This was a hysterical show from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Just when I thought some of it was staged, they picked someone in our group to tease! This is not the show to go and see if you take things too literally or find some jokes to be politically incorrect.The talent, jokes and actors were incredible. Two big thumbs up.
Very fun entertainment. Search google for discount code (I found $25 off per person). Not a fancy set, but fun entertainment. Raunchy, like everyone says, but comedy is funny and most of the acts are awe inspiring.
Great/Unique show, very funny/entertaining, its ranchy so if you are a prude stay home!  But if you are, why would you be in Vegas?  If you are sitting close be prepared to possibly be called to the stage, I did and had a great time!
Bravo! What a show!. . Absinthe was the highlight of my recent Vegas trip - simply the best show out there!. . Each year, me and some friends from college embark on a Vegas trip. Typically time is spent gambling, eating, and drinking. This time around we decided to try something new so bought tickets for Absinthe. And it's a great thing we did.. . Absinthe is the perfect blend of comedy and amazing acrobatics. The stunt with the chairs that started off the show was amazing. Yes, I was a bit nervous watching this thinking "there's no way he can actually do that without falling!" But alas, the performers were all magnificent. The weakest stunt was the high wire act, but even that was very impressive.. . Now for the comedy. Oh my goodness, I was rolling in my seat the whole time. Penny and the Gazillionaire were HILARIOUS. My friend Adam actually spit out his drink he was lughing so hard at one of Penny's one-liners - we might even need to change his nickname from Pizza to Spit-take!). But like many others said, the jokes are raunchy and politically incorrect, so be warned if you're sensitive to that kind of thing. Also, do NOT sit in the front row if you don't want to get picked on!. . So, as for the negatives: The only real negatives I can think of are the uncomfortable seats and the high drink prices. The seating issue can be alleviated buy purchasing a seat at a table (more expensive, I'm guessing). Beers are $9 in the theater, but that can be avoided by planning ahead and buying one across the street for $3 and bringing it in!. . To summarize: Go see this show! I know I will, again, when I'm back next March!
If you want to be amazed at some pretty amazing human stunts and laugh your ass off at the same time this is the show for you! If you all about being politically correct and  not a fan of foul language...well skip this one. Gay, straight, black, white, Hispanic, democrat and republicans....absolutely nothing is off limits here. . . Absinthe is set in a spiegle tent but don't let looks deceive you, it's much bigger inside than it appears. The audience sits around the small stage at the center of the tent.  For such a small area the circus-esque acts are pretty amazing, I was very impressed. . . The show is hosted by the Gazillionaire and his assistant Penny who will have you in tears the whole time. I spent 45 min getting my make up done before the show and cried a lot of it off laughing. I'm sure it changes daily but be prepaid for audience participation (READ watch your self if you sit in the front row!)...for our show an older and younger woman were brought on stage. The older lady was already embarrassed and then told she was going to motorboat the other girl. My BF looked at me at that point and asked what is going on up in this tent right now?!? To the cheers of the audience she did it...you go lady! . . This show is full of raunchy humor and a very talented cast of performers. Well worth the money and it's less than many Circs at that. You wont be disappointed!
My friend told me this was the best show in Vegas.  I was skeptical because I didn't even hear about it until I got to Vegas.  There weren't ads at the airport and the concierge didn't even recommend it.  None the less we got tickets and boy I'm so glad we did!  . . The venue is intimate-- it's part burlesque, part cirque, part comedy show.  Some of the jokes can get uncomfortable but just let loose and roll with the punches.  I think the Yelp pictures give too much away so don't look at them.  Buy tickets, watch, laugh, and get laid afterwards because whoever you bring is going is going to want to thank you later.
Unquestionably the best show in Las Vegas. Period.
This show is not for the faint of heart but for the rest of us it is awesome. It is the perfect combination of amazing acts and raunchy humor. We got the VIP tickets which provided a perfect view and a little personal space. This is definitely a must see.
I absolutely loved this show. I was either laughing so hard, my cheeks hurt or sitting there, mouth hanging wide open in astonishment. . . I thought the tempo was great. I like the way they mixed in the comedy with the more physical acts, breaking things up. The music was also really good. The tent that the show takes place in, is decorated beautifully. Kudos to the designer, it really helps to set the tone. . . I had just seen Ka the week before, and I thought that Absinthe was so much more enjoyable. I live in Las Vegas and was comped both shows, but Absinthe was better by far. In fact, I am taking my parents when they come to town.. . The one thing I will say is that if you can't handle bawdy humor or profanity, you might want to get a ticket to another show. . . Absolutely stellar!
Beautifully obscene! This was the absolute highlight of my trip to Vegas. We saw Love and loved it, but I think this was far more entertaining.. If you are PC, pass.
Gut-busting hilarity, provocative, uncensored, beautifully amazing feats of human strength. Raunchy, yes, but not just for the sake of shock value. This show is a finely-tuned piece of art with many different facets. You can go TackyVegas and see Celine, you can go PredictableVegas and see a show on the Cirque menu, or you can get your money's worth and then some (for half of the price of most others), and see the one and only Absinthe. I'll go every time that I'm in Vegas.
Hilarious, raunchy, uncomfortable, beautiful, and sexy.  In a theater in the round venue.  Amazing acrobatics.  The roller skating bit was breathtaking.  Not for those who are offended easily...check your political correctness at the door.  Would see again.
The show is the best I have seen in Vegas. The performances are amazing! The funniest show! Venue is great and intimate too!
The other reviews are correct! Very unique show and probably the highlight of my trip. I loved the humor and the acts were AMAZING. I loved the small intimate venue and it made the acts THAT much more amazing. Include it in your trip to Vegas!
Go, go, go!!!  Don't give it a second thought.  Well, give it a second thought if you don't enjoy raunchy humor as others have said.  This show was simply amazing from the comedy to the acrobat feats.  The only negative was the seating as the wooden chair was cramped and not good for my back (2 surgeries).  If you can only see one show while in Vegas, see this one!
Great show.  They were passing out $20 coupons.  I was confused about the seating, but my advice is to either get the cheap seats with the coupon, which ran about $75 a piece, or get the front row tickets because there is audience participation.  The second tier of VIP tickets (four rows between front row and cheap seats) seemed like a waste of money.  . . Anyways, it's a great show that mixes filthy humor with beautiful acts.  Definitely a highlight of the trip to Vegas.
This is one of my favorite shows in Vegas. The cast is extremely talented. The comedy duo and the roller skating couple are probably my favorites. Great show!!!
If you go to Vegas and have time for one show, THIS IS IT! Truly amazing. The perfect combination of funny, nail-biting, entertaining and down right raunchy! . . The host of the show picks on people from the audience and makes racial/sexual jokes about them, so if you are easily offended, this "is not the right fucking show for you!". You also get a lot of bang for your buck because the show is a lot longer than most but NEVER boring. Each act was unique and equally entertaining. . . Except for the one act with Angel from the tv show Girls Next Door where she bounces around in a the giant balloon... da fuck was that? You lose half a star there.
There are so many shows to choose from but if you have time for just one...you must pick this one!  To me it was Cirque, meets a Vegas type show (read: nudity & language) meets Rocky Horror.  It was simply outstanding.  The theater is fairly small, but really any seat you choose is a good one.  The chairs are on the smaller side so if you need/want more room, perhaps opt for one of the chair/table setups.  When you're inside, definitely take a look around - the props and setup are worth a look.  There is a bar outside of the tent to get a pre-show drink, plus a bar inside if you prefer to have a cocktail in hand while watching.  . . The reviews of this show are spot on.. the show is the perfect amount of raunchy, humor, nail-biting, and just plain old entertaining.  The entire cast is really talented!   If you get offended easily and prefer to stay on the PC side of things, this will not be your show!  Trust me!
Quite possibly the best show I've seen it Vegas! It was phenomenal. Well worth the money. Tickets for tonight sells tickets as well so be sure to keep your eye out. This is a variety show which is just amazing. I'm sure we'll be seeing it again!
The dude who narrates this show is a mix of Don Rickles and Richard Pryor, while his short sidekick is a foul-mouthed version of Gilda Radner or Madeline Kahn. The way those two insult each other, the performers, and the audience may be crude, racist, sexist, homophobic or whatever else but its absolutely hilarious. If you're offended, just remember: everyone gets crapped on!. . The gymnastic stuff was fun and entertaining, but, for me, the irreverent and politically incorrect humor was what I loved. The bit where the black and white guys come up to the stage to lap dance an Asian chic was hysterically funny. . . Only drawback: those wooden seats!
Must see! Hilarious show and intimate venue - raunchy humor mixed with daring acrobatics make for a fun evening. I will definitely see this show again the next time I am in Vegas.
Our friend recommended this show!! We loved it!!! I would 100% recommend this for  singles or couples. Absolutely not for kids. Lots of fun and F.. words. What a talented crew performing acrobatic tricks All performance are very sensual and romantic and lots of laughter in between. Get sits on first row if you like an attention ;)
Fantastic-not to be missed! A great combo of humor, picking on the audience and the ever-famous Vegas acrobatic/daredevil acts. I would go see it again in a heartbeat!
Here's some basic info for your reading enjoyment, check out the other reviews for a full summary of the experience.. . 1. Worth every penny. Have you checked out the ticket prices for Cirque?. 2. In a tent, but nice A/C and wall decorations all around. Think of House of Blues. 3. Friendly and attentive ushers will seat you, and accommodate your needs. Our usher saw that we were a little taller, so we got to sit on a park bench thing, just behind the main seating area. Very nice.. 4. The cocktail server will come by with some fluorescent blue rum drinks, try one!. 5. Super sexy show, no nudity, males and females will strip down to their skivvies. 6. The banter focused too much on blow jobs and oral sex, but whatevah, five stars.
Amazing!  If you are easily offended by off-color humor, go to Branson.  This show is a great combination of humor, sexuality, physical feats, and singing.  Well choreographed, excellently paced, and super attractive performers (of both sexes).  Don't take your kids, your grandma, or anyone else who you wouldn't watch a dirty movie with.  Best show I've seen in Vegas!  Worth every penny.
I'll keep it short as the other reviews are accurate: More filthy than you could imagine. Angel Porrino wearing very little. Lesbian trapeze artists. Hilarity, pageantry and -- this is really the important part -- incredible stunts by amazing, talented people. You'll come for the T&A and sex jokes but the acts are LEGIT.
This show was excellent! The traditional circus acts mixed with the adult humor was a perfect combo in the intimate setting of the tent. The acts definitely had that wow factor and the humor had us laughing so much! We loved the decor too.
Burt says THIS is the show to see in Vegas!  And don't be a cheapskate, sit in the front row.  VVIP ticks. . The Gazillionaire and Penny Pibbits are hilarious.  The acts are great.  The highlight is the roller skater act.  . . It's a much smaller act than the big Cirque shows and it's very personal.  The Cirque shows are all incredible.  Some more than others but really, they all are amazing on their own.  You can, and I have, reviewed them based on how one rates in comparison to the other.  But they are all so huge and spectacular you could go see them over and over again and notice all new things.  This show is scaled down and you can concentrate on the one amazing act being performed instead of 15 amazing acts going on at once.  . . Penny killed me.  So funny.  Burt wants to go back just to hear Penny do her puppet act again.  . . The act has some raunchy language and off color jokes.  But it's refreshing to see some adult humor for a change.  If your thin skinned, then just don't go.  . . Sit in the front row.  You feel as if you can be injured at any moment while you're sitting within arms length of these acts and it really adds to the excitement of the show.  Burt couldn't believe they can allow you to sit in harms way but they do.  It's fantastic.  . . Burt loved Absinthe and will tell anyone going to Vegas,  Absinthe is a MUST SEE
Totally great, amazing show in vegas. Amazing acrobats, hot girls, nice off-color language, etc. . . HOWEVAH... if any of you are in the bay area and you have a chance to see TOURETTES WITHOUT REGRETS this show is VERY similar to Tourette's. Crazy host who insults audience? yep. Sexy sidekick? yep. lap dance contest? oh yeah!. . obviously the acrobats, burlesque, etc was on an entirely different level but the vibe was very similar to tourette's, which I dug. . . Unlike most other las vegas shows, they also let you take pictures, which was kind of neat. They're pretty big sticklers about moving chairs though.
I REALLY enjoyed this show. I had never heard about it until my "girls Vegas trip" but everyone talked about how they enjoyed it. . It's not for the faint hearted.. Not for the easily offended.. Nothing is sacred.. But that's exactly what made it hilarious, totally up my alley, and probably "ok"? It's equal opportunity bashing and offending!. Love, love, love Penny.. The show has got something for everyone, comedy, acrobatics, burlesque, cabaret, and hunks! It really reminded me of the movie Moulin Rouge setting and all the highlights of Vegas shows rolled up into one fun and interactive 1.5 hour show.. The show is set in a small tent so there really isn't a "bad" seat and really feels cozy. I really hope that this show continues its success but never moves into a large venue! Highlight of my trip and hope to see it again. Traveling show anyone??
This is one of the best shows in Vegas, and it's not too expensive!  It is hilariously offensive - and I mean they tastefully offend everyone which makes it fantastic!  The cast is so charismatic, you just want more!  Yes the stage is smaller than the Cirqs, but the acts are just as good, some incredible stuff here!  There are no bad seats in the house, everyone is great being that it is a center stage!  Bars outside are also nice.  This is a definite must for a Vegas Show!
This show was exactly what I pictured when I think of Las Vegas, so I was so glad one of my friends recommended it to me. It is raunchy and definitely politically incorrect- but they seemed to target all groups equally- race, gender, political party, orientation, etc. If inappropriate humor bothers you, this probably is not a great show for you. The show itself was full of Acrobatics, mostly nude men and women, dirty jokes to the max! My only complaint is that the chairs are so close together that the large man next to me was practically on my lap for the entire 2 hour show- which was uncomfortable. Wish we had splurged for the more spacious seating. Used an online discount code to save $20 per ticket. Definitely recommend this show!!!
What a fun show - I was a little skeptical because of the price and the small venue, but it was everything you want in a vegas show: comedy, stunts, and good production values.  Worth every penny.
I've seen most of the mainstream shows in Vegas, and this is my favorite.
Read the reviews, they are 100% accurate.  The people who did not like it were simply at the wrong show for them.  I laughed the entire time.  I was splashed by a sexy singer in a bowl of water, and sat on by the gazillionaire in a speedo!!!! The show will have you in stitches.  Don't take it serious, everyone is equally offended.. Penny is awesome.
You gotta go and see this show.  I went with a group of friends and everyone really enjoyed it.  Every act and song was better than the one before.  It's kinda of hard to explain the story, but if you want an evening of fantastic entertainment go andrun to see it.
A fun show in a small venue.  Decided to go at the last minute while sitting in the courtyard in front of Caesars where Serendipity is.  Something for women and men. The acrobatics are pretty awesome and the comedy is truly enjoyable.
LOVED this!  It was Cirque mixed with the most vulgar comedy I've ever seen live.  You'll laugh, you'll cry (probably from laughing too much), you'll oh and ah, and you'll feel incredibly awkward for a majority of the show.  And you'll love every minute of it!  Well, unless you get easily offended by any jokes regarding race, sex/sexuality or political affiliation (and c'mon, you know if you do).  Then you should just go see Celine Dion and call it a night.. . I really liked the fact that it was in a smaller venue (tent right by Serendipity 3 & in front of Caesar's Palace).  I honestly couldn't imagine there being a bad seat in the house.  We paid $80 per ticket (bought at Tix4Tonight) and were somewhere in the middle on the right hand side and found the seats to be more than adequate.  The only time I couldn't see something was when a performer was on a particular spot on the side stage and there was a pole blocking my view.  But no biggie.. . If you sit in the front be prepared to potentially get horrendously ridiculed.  I feel so bad for some of those people.  And the white guy vs black guy dance off was classic.  Kudos to those that get up and participate in front of everybody!. . I thought all the acts were incredible.  It was a really good mix of comedy, burlesque, incredible strength, and acrobatics.  I even got a little misty-eyed by the couple that performed to that Christina Perri song A thousand Years.. . As a sidenote, I can't get over the fact that someone below (Maria O.) gave this a one star review because it wasn't family-friendly.  Are you freaking kidding me?!?  You deserve a one star for your parenting.  Who brings their kids to a Vegas show without first looking into what it's about or if it's appropriate for kids?!   That's your own damn fault, not the performers.
Best show I have seen in Vegas!!!  Pee your pants funny!!!  I will say, that the comedy at this show does not hold back, so if the "f" word offends you or if explicit sex jokes offend you, then DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOW.  But otherwise, you will not regret it.  It was soooooo funny.  . . Has a little bit of everything.  Acrobatic acts, comedy, burlesque....it has it all.  And Penny will leave you doubled over laughing, I guaranty.  Not to be missed.. . And as for the people who said they took their kids or family to this and were shocked by the vulgarity - are you retarded???  Did you not see the HUGE sign at the door saying this was an ADULT themed show and not appropriate for minors????  You should give 1 star to your own stupidity, not the show.
I have seen his a couple of times now. The last time being about a year ago. I was really happy that they changed the format a ton and really was like I had never seen it. Some of the bits were the same, but the overall show was totally changed around. Was hilarious and is something that is hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen it. Great acts! Lots of laughs! I highly recommend!
Love love loved it! Very vulgar comedy - which was the most I have probably every truely laughed in my life! The acts were great, a nice variety. It is held in a tent in front of ceasars which looks small and plain. You get inside and it is older wooden decor, mixed and matched pieces, and a distinct older smell - in a good way ... hard to explain. We sat in the front row which makes you a target for being picked on for everyone's enjoyment. If you are in front, you are literally 2 feet from the very small circular stage which is awesome. Every seat is a good seat in this place though. Best time ever. My spouse loved the show as well, and he is as far from a "play, musical, show" going kind of guy as you can get. Conservatives beware...
This hands down has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen. I really didn't know what to expect when coming into it except that it's a raunchy Cirque du soleil-esque production and is much better than Zumanity. . . However, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I laughed so profusely that it turned into a cry-laugh session for the entire show. The humor is raunchy, awkward, dirty and simply quite flipping hilarious. If you're easily offended, however, stay away from Absinthe. It's definitely not for the conservative traditionalists or for the faint of hearts. . . And the acrobatics is on par with Cirque du soleil productions and is truly outstanding. I remember ooohing and ahhhing several times throughout the various acts. . . Without giving away too much, it's definitely a show to watch to feel like you've acquired the true Vegas experience - a raunchy acrobatics production that will make you both burst with laugher and jump with awe. . . Tips: all of the seats in the theater are great so you don't really have to upgrade to the VIP seats like we did. In addition, think twice before sitting in one of the first two rows - you'll most likely get picked on and this isn't the good kind of picked on that you'll want. . . Enjoy!
Absinthe was super fun. I am sure for some the jokes could be offensive, so go in expecting to hear some politically incorrect and irreverent humor. . . I thought it was the best show I've seen on the strip. It had some fantastic performances and a lot of gut wrenching laughs.. . I would totally recommend it to anybody who isn't afraid to laugh and be entertained.. . Fellas, beware of being chosen to perform an onstage lap dance...
Wow....entertainment extravaganza!   There are very few shows I'd pay to see twice but this one of them.  Brace yourself for an evening of inappropriate, off-color, irreverent and raunchy humor, jokes and stage acts but it all works.  In fact, despite looking over at my girlfriend a hundred times during the two hour performance with the look of disbelief of what we just heard or saw we both left smiling, laughing and saying "that was so fun!"   Be prepared if you sit in the first few rows of the circular stage that you will most likely get wet but more importantly fear for your life with a few of the stage acts that take place on such a small stage.  If you're thinking of buying one of the more expensive tables close to the stage be prepared to get picked on and included in the show as comic relief for the benefit for all:-).   Note: if you're offended easily or have thin skin this is definitely not the show for you!. . This is a one of a kind Las Vegas show in a town full of unique, one of a kind shows.  This is a must see Vegas act!
Never thought it would be this good!! Amazing performance and they are really funny!! It can get raunchy and inappropriate for some people!!
A must see! Loved the show! You have to look past the tent because the in side is decorated very nice. You will be amazed what they can do on that little stage. Out staining show!
Loved this show! Its like burlesque, a comedy show, and and Circ du Soleil combined. If you're in Vegas and haven't seen it yet, go see it. The absinthe drinks they serve are super tasty too.
My first show in Vegas and I've been here like more than 20+ times. It was an EXCELLENT show. My friend who's been to other main stream shows said this was by far the best. . . I thought it was good because it was smaller, intimate, funny, sexual, lots of good moves, audience engagement, you were at the edge of your seat every time! The performances were very impressive. I was amazed and wonder how they did it... crazzzzy. . . What a great show! I would write more but you should see it to believe it!!
FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! A must see!. . There are no bad seats and you feel like you are about to be slapped in the face by someone on stage. . . If you are not uptightand don't mind curse words and insults.. . #1 show in vegas for me so far...
Honestly, I don't think I've ever been so excited to tackle a review!! I've heard good things about Absinthe and it's been on my 'last remaining shows to watch in Vegas; list for awhile. I'd have to say, I truly saved the best for last (or close to last..)!!. . First off, this is an 18 and up show. Although ages 70+ is allowed, I wouldn't recommend you coming with your g-ma, grand-daddy, mumzy, and papa bear, to this show as a family bonding event. Well, unless they have a great sense of raunchy humor, then lucky for you!! This is most definitely a show for mature audiences. The language used will give the average conservative Stepford family a heart attack. That being said, this show became a personal instant favorite. . . LOCALS, if you haven't seen this, you really need to! There's a local discount of $20 off regular pricing (I was misinformed and told there was 50% off... darn) If you purchase regular seating, be sure to pick up tickets early because they work off somewhat a 'first come first serve' system. Your seats are determined by how early you pick up the tickets at the box office. . . So now on to my personal experience. The moment I walked into the tent, I fell in love. I am a sucker for the rustic vintage decor. I felt like I was brought back to the early 1900s of Barnum & Bailey, with its small intimate setting with single bulb hanging lights, random deer head fixtures hanging on the walls, and a small circular stage centered with one spotlight shining down on it to keep the tent somewhat lit. . . As the show started, it got better and better. I won't go into too much detail, I wouldn't want to ruin it for you like that! The acts were exciting, some typical circus acts, and others with a more creative flair. I liked that they keep the show modern by implementing current music -- I shazammed during the show quite a bit hehe. But the best parts was definitely when the host and his assistant came out in between the acts. My cheeks were so sore by the end of the show cause they were HILARIOUS. This is where the necessity of being a mature audience comes in; lots of bad language, dirty jokes, and stereotypes.. . One of my most favorite shows in Vegas!!
What a great show. . . I went to see this about 3 months ago with my 2 roommates/best friends, and one's Mom.  . . I'll be honest, I had NO idea what this show was about.  I've lived in Vegas for a decade, and have seen signs for the show for ages...but I don't see a lot of shows, and I'm on a pretty tight budget.  . I had a friend who was involved in the show who comped our tickets.. . I WILL be going back, and probably paying for front row seats.. . When we walked in, the "circus tent" like setup (Spiegeltent) was SO unbelivabley cool.   Really, my only complaint about the show is that the seats are SUPER close together...and if you're seated on an end, and someone needs to get into the middle of the row...you are standing up and moving out of the way...the rows and seats are all really close and kind of cramped.  But...other than that issue, there's not a bad seat...I just want the front row so I can be that much closer to the action.. . The show is definitely not safe for kids, or for those who are easily offended.  Lots of cussing, sex humor and drug references from the hosts (who are HILARIOUS!!!), in addition to some implied sexy time fun stuff in the acts.  (A burlesque dancer in pasties, and two "school girl" acrobats that strip down to their undies and portray a budding "curious" relationship.). . I REALLY hope that you allcan look past some of the things that you might fine a little offensive to see this show though.. . The acrobatics are incredible.  Stong men, rollerskates, burlesque girls, tight rope walkers, ariealists, trapeze artist...this show has AS MUCH talent as a Cirque du Soleil show, but none of the weird makeup effects.  Also, GREAT music.  . . I'm SO glad that I was able to see the show, and can't wait to see it again.
This show will blow your mind.  I was entertained the entire two hours.  They did some cirque du soleil acts but you got to see them up close which was mind blowing.  The MC/host is hilarious to the point that my stomach hurt.  I love the creativity and the decor.  Amazing show, cannot wait to go again!
Incredibly offensive, funny, exciting, and entertaining all at the same time. . . If you're easily offended or conservative or politically correct then this probably isn't for you - but I loved this show! . . It's an intimate circus in a small tent where the performers are so close you can literally feel the sweat fly off their bodies. The acts are original in their style and presentation even if you may have seen many of these things in Cirque Du Soliel. . . What sets it apart is the hilarious comic who  is the MC and who makes a point of offending all races, genders and sexual orientations in the first five minutes. Add to that a deliberate attempt to spice up the acts with a little extra sex appeal and you get a fresh and funny experience you'll laugh about for a long time. . . I would definitely go again and would even take my parents. But not my grand parents nor my kids. In fact I can't imagine that they let minors into the show.
Packs everything from Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, cabaret, hilarious comedy acts all into one incredibly entertaining show.  Jaw-dropping acrobatics acts, all with a little bit of a sexy flair.  The stand up comedy was very blue and seemingly off the cuff making fun of audience members (be warned), and I'm not a big fan of musical numbers, but the girls had amazing voices and other assets ;) as well.  Not topless, but as close as you can get.. . Well worth the price, they hand out $20 off coupons near the venue during the afternoon as well as you can get the same deal at the discount ticket booths around the strip...don't pay full price.
Amazing show! It is a very raunchy but beautiful show that's is NOT for the easily offended person.. . Outside of the Caesars Palace a giant tent  houses this show, but from the outside you would never know why actually happens on the inside. Inside is filled with a sleazy ringmaster and his "sister" who had many of us in tears as he brought the audience into his comedy throughout the show. His part is really a small number to the entire show, but is one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced combined with acrobatics which were breathtakingly refreshing between each comedy bit.. . Drinks are offered inside and are priced average compared to other properties. Multiple levels of seating, including a separate VIP  section (a small ticket upgrade open to anyone), have a view of all the action regardless to the seat placement.  My only issue I experienced was the close proximity each chair shared to their neighbor and how if you're paired next to some larger attendees it can be a little nerve racking when fighting to just be able to clap..... . 5 stars this is a MUST EXPERIENCE!
OMG this show is a riot. It's sexy, raunchy, hilarious, original, daring and intimate. . . Open minded people only. They pick on everyone of all shapes, sizes and colors, so those easily offended, please stay home (or get tickets for another show in town.). . The performers were all amazing. There is not a bad seat under this intimate tent, so you get to see every aspect of this variety show. . . The gazillionaire was hilarious!!. . do it!
Fantastic show that lived up to all the reviews I had read on here previous to going. All the performers were extremely impressive, and the gazillionaire had us all laughing hysterically. Highly recommended Vegas show.
This show is what Las Vegas is all about. Sexy, raunchy, irreverent, non PC fun.  I had a front row seat to the hilarity and enjoyed every second of the performances.  This show is NOT for children or for the easily offended.  The humor is very raunchy but I had no issue with it.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house and all of the performances were great.  If I were to recommend one show to a friend going to Vegas, this would be it!
This show is certainly by far one of the most fun, relaxing and jaw dropping show I've seen anywhere. You need to be open minded and checkout all your isms before going as it does poke fun at everyone and everything, and its quite racy..so avoid the front row seats if you're sensitive.  It's a small intimate venue which makes it seem like and exclusive event. Had a fabulous time and will certainly recommend it.
Love, love, love!!!!!!  This show is amazing and the talent is extraordinary.  The two Masters of Ceremonies are incredible!  Their energy is infectious and their quick repartee "looks easy", but that my friends, is TALENT and SKILL!!!!  Oh yes, the beauty and physical strength of the specialty performers is certainly a sight to behold, made even better because of the intimate performance space.  However, if you're easily "offended" by salty language or inappropriate humor you probably won't enjoy the show.  I, of course....ate it up and wanted more!!!! This is a MUST SEE!!!!!
Definetly not for the conservative type of person. This show is  definetly a captivating and exciting show that mixes acrobatics, imagination,  and a little raunchyness. Great show and a must see here in Vegas!
I really didn't expect to like this show, since it's such a small production compare to other shows in Vegas. I've seen every single Cirque du Soleil's shows in Vegas, and didn't think this show would be able to compare. But I was wrong, this show is very very good. The intimacy of the tent and small stage really made the show better in a lot of ways, which I wasn't expecting at all. . . Being a long time Cirque du Soleil fan, I really hate to say this. Even though the Cirque du Soleil's shows are all incredible, if you are only seeing one show in Vegas, make it Absinthe. If you can't handle the mildly offensiveness of this show, then Vegas just isn't a great vacation destination for you.
so. good. just go.
WTF is this show about?! . . Who gives a shit?! Go see it! You won't regret it. . . Just don't go with your mom. Or actually, that might be interesting...
This show was so entertaining.  I absolutely loved it.  I will see it again when I am in Vegas next time.. Do not buy the VIP seats, it is not worth the extra price.  The champagne is awful, I could not drink it.  We paid $40.00 extra to be close to the stage, but next time I will not buy VIP.  All the seats are good, you do not need to pay extra unless you want to be in the front row.
What can I say that everyone else hasn't said already?  Well, I have to chime in to add to the awesome... . This show is great - close up amazing cirque-style acts, extremely raunchy yet hilarious comedy, and of course a little bit of sex appeal thrown in for good measure.  The night we came we didn't get to see the high-wire act for some reason, but that's ok.  My favorite acts were the aerialists Ming and Alexa (so hot and so graceful!), followed by the two trapeze girls - that one girl was so strong - she was awesome!. . Anyway, I will reiterate - please don't take anyone remotely conservative to this show, they will definitely not enjoy it.  A minor quibble I have is that the seats are really crammed together.  Also some drunk horrible dude in the seat in front of us was so drunk he spilled his drink all over his shoulder (and thus all over us).  I wish they wouldn't let too-drunk people in.  Oh well.
AMAZING! Absolutely loved it!! It's the raunchy, sexy, burlesque version of Cirque. We went because the Cirque show we wanted to see was all sold out and saw an ad for this show in the cab on the way to dinner and I'm so glad we went! . . The performers are amazing in their acrobatics, but what really sets this show apart is the comedy. It's offensive and vulgar and absolutely piss your pants funny. If you're sitting in the front row, you'll probably get made fun of in some way. But don't worry - they're an equal opportunity offender and will make their way around to all races, ages, genders, religions, political affiliations, and sexual orientations. . . If you are easily embarrassed or conservative in any way, you probably shouldn't go. Otherwise, this show is an absolute MUST SEE while you're in Vegas!! Just don't take your parents... or do and it will make for some great laughs. Like the girl sitting between her parents in the front row at our show... (to the daughter) "That dick as been in that mouth".
Awesome and freaking hilarious!  Saw this with my wife and mother.  I was worried about my mom because there is some risque stuff.... it is vegas... but she was laughing hard.  This show has it all: Comedy, Acrobatics, Visual Appeal, Music, Singing, EVERYTHING :)  Loved it would see it again.
Best show, frickin' amazing...not your typical Vegas show. Comedy will have your tummy hurting you'll laugh so much! Its pretty raunchy so if you are a goody goody, go somewhere else.
This show was recommended to us by our timeshare and my husband jumped on the suggestion.  I had reservations about it because I wanted to watch the Blue Man Group instead, but hey the show is Cirque Du Soleil and you can't go wrong watching a Cirque show so I happily obliged.. . Thank goodness the tent is small because you get to see everything up close and personal.  It was really cool seeing the skaters that skate on the drum that close and it was probably my favorite performance.. . But let me just say this is not your average Cirque performance.  This show is laced with comedy, vaudeville, and acrobats.  It's also not a show you want to be in if you're a reserved church girl like me because for most of the night I was sitting uncomfortably.  AND the host likes to use the audience as part of his show.  Sure enough I get chosen to be a part of his act and at first I tried to play stupid pretending he wasn't looking in my direction.  But I went up anyway because everyone was looking at me and I didn't want to hold up the show.  It was a truly mortifying experience.  He chose two guys to basically do a lap dance for me and I had to choose which one was the best.  Again, I'm a church girl and this totally sucked for me.. . So as a warning, if you are not ready to be a part of the show, may I suggest something else.
We saw this show listed as one of the best shows to see in Vegas so we got tickets. . We got front row seats at the tables, they can with a free drink. . The acts were amazing! there wasn't a bad seat in the whole place! The two lead characters where fantastic. I won't lie it was a bit racy, but i laughed the whole time! I would recommend this show to all my friends and family and i DEFIANTLY WANT TO GO AGAIN!
This is one of the best shows I have seen in Vegas or anywhere else. It is not for the faint of heart. Definitely not for kids or those who offend easily. The MCs were hilarious, the acts were interesting and talented.
Fan-freaking-tastic. I was skeptical given it's name and temporary looking tent in front of Ceasar's make it seem like a lame attempt to impersonate a Cirque show. Turns out, this is one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen. The jokes were hi-larious, the acts entertaining feats of physical prowess and the music/lights perfectly designed to suck you into the show. We even Shazamed a few songs to get them for ourselves later. I'd see it again in a heartbeat.. . Pro tip: There are sometimes guys handing out $20 off coupons near the tent the day of the show. Pick up one of those and buy at the box office to save a whole heap of cash.
I would give this show six stars! We heard of the show only by walking by the tent and someone handed us a discount card... I read the yelp reviews and they were mostly positive so we said "what the hell"... Soooooo glad we did... This show is AMAZING! I laughed so hard I was crying, I had to take my glasses off to keep wiping my eyes. This show is NOT for the conservative, homophobic, or those that are sense of humor challenged. The show pokes fun at all stereotypes in a really funny way, so you have to be willing to laugh at yourself a little. . The performers are breathtaking. Because the tent isn't that large, every seat seams intimate and right on top of the performance. The music that each performance is choreographed to is perfect, and the singing numbers are original and amazing. . I'm not much of a gambler or party'er anymore but I would come back to Vegas to see Absinthe again. I whole heartily agree with the Huff post review "if you only see one show in Vegas, see Absinthe"
Every show in Vegas seems to bill itself as the "can't miss show in town." In my opinion, if you really could only see one show in Vegas, I would recommend Absinthe over and over. It's not for everyone as the hosts are very dirty, but if you have that same sense of humor, your abs will hurt the next day from laughing so hard. . . The circus tent is small, but that means every seat in the house provides great views. The acts are incredible, and more than once my jaw dropped open at what I was seeing take place. I usually don't feel like I need to see a show more than once, but I would see Absinthe at least three more times.
I missed my calling in life. I totally should have been a burlesque dancer. . . So as devastated as I am about this, I'll continue to be one in my dreams and in the privacy of my own home. That being said, if I could create a dream world this would be it. Profanity, pretty people practically naked, sparkly costumes and heels, humor that makes you blush, champagne, dancing, acrobatics, great music, and one adorable secret VIP door that is a London phone booth! Like I sad before, what life should be like 90% of the time. I haven't laughed that hard in ages...probably months. My abs were hurting. I couldn't breathe. Tears were streaming down my face. It was magnificent. . . Another confession...when I'm at a show and they are picking audience members out...I have to be chosen. I have to be involved. Maybe it is because I'm an only child but thank heavens we were in the VIP table area right by the stage because I need interaction. It's OK, you can judge me. I judge myself sometimes. Word to the wise, some of the interaction can be mortifying so if you blush easily, stay away from the first couple of rows. But if you are a complete attention hog, you're going to want (read: must) sit in the front. . . Also, if you are easily offended, might not want to come here. They definitely push the envelope. I wasn't necessarily offended but certainly grossed out...mostly when Penny took the stage. Puppet sex? No, thanks. Not quite my cup of tea. (But I respect their artistic right to do so.). . I never want to see a show or movie twice (What's the point?) but this one...well, this was so good that I could watch it again...and probably will.
LOVED IT!. . If you are offended by racial jokes that clearly plays on well understood stereotypes, this is not for you. Yes, I'm Asian and everyone there knows the jokes were jokes and we're all intelligent people.. . The show is FANTASTIC! Really enjoyed it.
Incredible!!! The acts were hilarious and majestic. But certainly not for the easily offended!
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SHOW I"VE EVER SEEN  !!! If you are in Vegas you cannot miss Absinthe !!! It is incredibly vulgar and offensive !! I have never laughed so hard, ended up hitting my boyfriend a bunch of times because I couldn't breathe from laughing so much.  The acrobatics are insane, I was very impressed.. . If you are conservative, save your money, this show is NOT for you.  This show is NOT family friendly.  Go to La Reve which is the most boring show I have ever seen, should be 65+ !! . . GO SEE ABSINTHE !!
absolutely hands down the most entertained Ive ever been~ I wish the show went on for hours and hours! I cant wait to go back! Not a bad seat in the house and the cast is athletic and gorgeous!  Don't leave Vegas without seeing this show!
First, if you cant deal with raunchy content or language, then don't go, simply put. If you are offended easily, don't go.. . The venue is very small, you are literally right by the stage. Even the farthest seats away are close. The show is intense, funny as heck and well worth the money. One of the best shows I have ever seen with its comedy and its acrobats. You will love it. The things that these people do on chairs, roller skates, with hand puppets and much more will have you amazed and laughing your butt off.. . Go see it.
What a great show! Careful though it's not a show for the folk who easily get offended by off-color jokes and non politically correct comments. The revue is long overdue with the glut of cirqe de solei venues on the strip. It's a nice mix of acrobatics, raunchiness, and just plain fun. Situated in a tent just outside Cesar's Palace makes a cool place for the show. it's like going to a circus without the boring horses and not funny clowns, but filled with lots of adult oriented jokes instead.
Over 600+ Review, I'll try and keep mine to the point!. . -Box Office located outside in the courtyard, look for the Absinthe Tent. -Two Shows per night, 7:30 & 9:30PM (Dark on Monday+Tuesday). -Expect to pay a minimum of $100 after all the fees. -No discount at actual box office . -Discount tickets available at 'Tickets 4 Tonight'; average $80 total. -No entrance into the tent till 5 minutes before the show. -Located on Cesar Palace's ground. -Well ventilated, no worries on freezing or heating up. -9:30PM show ends around 11PM. . What makes Absinthe so great is the overall show. The transition with the comedic sketches, burlesque singing, and the circus acts makes this show the most entertaining in Vegas so far! The intimate setting also puts Absinthe a step above all the Cirque Du Soleil Show. . . They do some audience participation in the show, so front row....BEWARE. You'll get what you paid for! I'm not going to go into all the details of the show, just check out the photos and you'll get the general idea.. . Photos were permitted, just no flash photography. Absinthe is definitely a must and a show I would recommend; definitely refreshing after all the other shows I've seen in Vegas. Till the next act, ciao!
So much fun, amazing performances! Unique and hilarious!!!! Can't wait to see it again, highly recommend. Only con is the uncomfortable wooden chairs....but if you drink enough before the show, you probably wouldn't notice ;-)
GREAT show. Hands down the best show in Vegas. Though, it's not for people who are easily offended.
One of the best and coolest shows I have ever seen...and I LOVE shows!! The decor is amazing, music is good, acrobats beyond talented and comedy is so raunchy I felt like I had to take a shower after!! This is well worth the money! I can't wait to come back and see it again!!
This show is fantastic. I'm still thinking about it 2 days later. Though it is certainly not for children, I found the comedy to be hilarious and well executed. This is Vegas at its best, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Totally worth the $100+ ticket!  Its like seeing a Cirque du Soleil show sitting on the stage without the crazy French stuff and insert bawdy jokes.  Imagine a woman being swung around by her feet by a guy on roller skates only 3 feet from your face... Sounds dangerous, yes but also thrilling!. . If you get the VIP (1st or 2nd row tickets), you get your own little bottle of champagne to enjoy during the show.  But the theater is tiny, so any seat in the house is excellent.
Absinthe is the best show I've been to in Vegas - fun location under a circus tent, awesome vibe inside, a great view from everywhere. The MC will have you laughing your ass off, and the acts are sexy, awe-inspiring, and incredible...I sort of want to go learn trapeze now.. :-P. . If you're sensitive to partial/ basically full nudity, strong language, and raunchy comedy...this show might not be for you. If you do go, I recommend Tix 4 Tonight, which usually has them for around $75-$80. . . There really is something for everyone at this show - I recommend it for literally anyone visiting Vegas. Grab a couple drinks before you head in, and have an amazing time!
If you are going to Vegas for a good show, this is the ONE!  It is a raunchy burlesque/Cirque show.  . . I am not going to say to much as I don't want to give the show away. The vibe was great, the dancers were great.  There is nothing bad to say about this show.  . . BRAVO!!!!!!  . . **Do buy your tickets at the 1/2 price booths to save some $$ for any shows in Vegas!!
Take a great CdS show, put on by a bunch of very talented and beautiful  friends (of yours), stage it in your living room,  and toss in an outrageous pair of MCs. The athletics are at once down to earth and amazing. The jokes are hilarious and as down to earth as you can get. . . Two tips. Seating is tight, try for an aisle. If you're a guy and in the front row, don't show up with two other guys all wearing plaid shirts
I absolutely loved this show.  Upon entering the tent I felt immediately transported to another time and place.  The eclectic gypsy-esque tent does not have one bad seat.  Everyone has a great view.  Attention to every last detail is given in his show.  Temperature, smell, lighting, decor, employees, and even down to the performances.   There was not one single flaw or mistake.Go see this show!!!!!  It's amazing!
Hands down, the best show I have seen in Vegas...and I have seen a lot of shows.  I've been many Cirque Du Soleil shows and this was my favorite.  The acts are very similar except you get to be way closer.  The tone is very raunchy, so don't see this with your parents.  There is a lot of sexual innuendo.  A couple of the acts are semi-topless (with just nipple covers).  If you don't like that, you won't like this show.  . . Seating: VIP seating in the front is stupid.  You spend most of the night looking up.  The VIP seating in the back is way better.  I recommend the VIP2 section in Row T7.  They are on a raised platform with tables and chairs.  They have the best seats in the house.  Since this event is so intimate already, you don't need to spend more money to get closer.  I got seats in row G.  We sat in seats 28 and 29 (by the side).  We had bomb-ass seats.  I would choose these seat again.  Why?  Because row G is the first row that is elevated.  All the rows in front of us were directly in front of each other (no raised seating).  So, if there is someone tall in front of you, you are screwed.  Also, our seats were on the side.  This was really important because the wooden seats are small.  I'm small, so this wasn't a problem for me.  But if your party has guys, you may want to look for the seats in the very back or the seats with tables.  You will be way more comfortable.  Believe me.  You will regret it if you get stuck in the middle of a row.  By the way, the chairs are tied together...so no moving them.  Also, keep in mind that the set up of the chairs on their website may not be exactly what you get inside.  When I brought my tickets, it appeared that I brought my ticket in a group of just three chairs.  Not so.  Our group of three chairs were squished with the other seats next to it.  Our seats also had no one in front of us.. . Location:  Located in the Roman Plaza of Caesars Hotel.  It's literally on the left side of the front entrance of Caesars.  It's outside in a tent.  Don't worry, its not cold inside.  But, it was butt-cold outside.  Our 9:30pm show started a little late.  Oh, and when the show is about to start, they will line you up in two lines.  Just get in the shorter line.  They try to put you in a line that is closer to the side with your chairs.  Its all the same.  Just get in the shorter line to get in.  They won't question you.  The two lines merge anyways...right after you enter the doors.  . . Show:  Awesome, entertaining...very similar to Cirque Du Soleil but less formal.  I would totally recommend this show to you over Cirque Du Soleil.
Funniest show ever. Tight seating arrangement, but worth it. Will see it again and again.
I swear this is the best show I've ever watched and I've watched almost every show. I recommend this to everyone! I was seriously laughing out loud the entire time! I like the way the tent is set up too it's very intimate and theres not a bad seat in the tent. I beg you people! Go watch this show now!
This might be the best show in Vegas! I've seen a lot of shows here, and a lot of Cirque shows. This show has it all! . It's set in a veryintimate tent outside of Caesars Palace. From what it seems, all seats are good seats! We sat in row F and never had trouble seeing what was going on. All the acts are amazing in their own way and I found myself gasping slack jawed several times. Ladies are absolutely gorgeous and talented! . It's raunchy and hilarious and full of sexual jokes and foul language. I loved it! Go see it! I would highly recommend this to anyone, as long as you aren't a prude!
Best show in vegas! Watch it! If you don't have a sense of humor, you're the type to take things serious or you're just a boring person, then don't watch it. This show was so hilarious I almost peed in my pants!
The show was worth every penny! I'm just sad I didn't have enough to buy my cousins and brothers tickets. I ended up going just me and my boyfriend. I was excited as soon as my boyfriend and I walked in. They set a fun, intimate atmosphere. Lucky for us, we got bumped up to front row seats..the stage was only a few arm lengths away. It was crazy seeing what these performers can do. I can hardly pick a favorite act because it was all so good. The humor in between acts is very crass and vulgar- if that isn't your thing, maybe don't go... Myself, on the other hand was laughing my ass off like crazy. You go from laughing your ass off to being totally mesmerized in the acts. The performances are truly beautiful and sexy and mind blowing.
So many people have told me to watch this show and I'm glad I finally did! This show is amazing!!! Both hilarious and entertaining at the same time - Tears were rolling down my face at one point from all the laughing! This show in not for everyone, so definitely go in there with an open mind and get buzzed, have a drink & loosen up! Every seat inside the tent is a good seat - It's a small stage, but they manage to do so much on there it's incredible! I'd love to see this show again & again & AGAIN!
This is everything you want in a Vegas show. You have a raunchy comedy duo, acrobatic insanity, a sultry female singer and some.... suggestive themes.. . The tent set out outside of Caesar's is actually as small as it looks so you can't get far from the action. The back section is elevated to don't skip this one if you are looking to save a little money by getting some discounted tickets. If you get too close to the front, be prepared to be part of the act and you better have a good sense of humor. . . If you're like me and went to yelp to decide which show to see, this is definitely the one you want.
