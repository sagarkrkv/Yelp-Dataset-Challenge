Serendipity, was it meant to be? Or was it just a chance liquor induced meeting the night before? Maybe it was or was not, so I went back during the day (sobered up) to make sure it was real. . . The night before I had frozen hot chocolate, chilli cheese dog with sauerkraut, and a jalapeno-bacon pretzel. At the time, all of them were solid five and six stars. Unfortunately, now that I'm back with a clear mind, and a six star rating only exists through inebriated eyes, the frozen hot choco and chilli cheese dog were just ordinary.. . The frozen hot chocolate was wasted the second time when I realized it was just a chocolate shake topped with hot cocoa powder. The chili cheese dog, although a decent foot long, was your normal chilli cheese dog. . . On the bright side, I did have a winner with the jalapeno-bacon pretzel. I don't like pretzels, but in this type of combination that was served with a side bacon horseradish, I can eat them all day.. . Overall: a decent place to eat when you're hungry after a late night on the strip, but a hit-or-miss during the day. 3 stars for the dogs and drinks. 4 stars for the pretzel, and that is what I'll be back for next time.
Lady was a complete asshole when we came at 10:15. We weren't notified that they were closing early or anything but it would have been fine if they had just let us know instead of keeping us waiting for 45 min. We then asked to order something to-go still 20min before their closing time and were rudely told that they were closing early and the hostess very promptly snatches the menus we were holding and walked away. No apology for the inconvenience. Could have been handled way better by any normal service person.
this place is way better than the reviews gave it credit for and we havent had dessert!
I missed out on Serendipity last time I was in NYC, so when I found out there was a location at Caesar's I knew I had to try it. That was all I wanted, so I just ordered at the walk-up window- there's a restaurant side with seating as well. The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, as anticipated! My only complaint: it was a little bit gritty, possibly wasn't blended up as much as it should have been. . . They had a ton of ice cream sundaes as well, which looked amazing. Next time!
The Frozen Hot Chocolate is so cute, get the one for two with sprinkles, very cute for photos :) I like it cause it is not as thick as a milk shake, it is like a melted malt, yum!  The wait for inside dining is so long, but they will text you. I think the visual of having a gigantic dessert drink in a glass is better than the outside plastic cup, its for instagram guys get real, haha. . . It is sweet and cute, but I wouldn't wait 45 mins for this unless you put your name in first then go walk around.
Frozen hot chocolate and their onion rings are amazing. I love their food and it's well priced.
Serendipity is one of our favorite dinner or dessert place in LV. The place is under construction and it was cold outside so seating was hard but my Diamond Total Rewards card helped faster than usual seating and discount pricing.  I tried the Las Vegas Steak cooked medium rare with 3 sunny side eggs in French bread for first time and it was worth it. My son and wife split the Portobello Mushroom Burger and they said it was delicious.
I enjoyed the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. Corned beef hash and mushroom omelets were tasty. Make sure you arrive early and get your name on the wait list. Then have a Bloody Mary while while waiting.
The NYC location far exceeds in service and food quality.  I was very disappointed with the flavors and how poorly the food was presented.  Also after having Max Brenner's chocolate milkshake and Frozen Chocolate "Granita", Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate has lost its luster for me.. . There are many places to eat in Las Vegas.  Serendipity 3 isn't worth the trouble or wait.
My husband and I came back here on 12/31/2013, to have our dinner before the firework on the strip. I got to say that we were very happy with our server. He is really really sincere and polite. I saw that he was sincere with every table he served. Service does make a big difference in your dining experience!!!!!. We shared a caeser salad with add-on steak, and got the "one and only one las vegas strip steak sandwich" (yes, again), and a Forbidden Broadway Sundae. Everything tasted good. And the sundae was really delicious and satisfying! It was a great meal to end the year 2013. =D
I had one menu item... EVERYONE should have it... Frozen Hot Chocolate. YUM... I can't say anything else aboutthis place ha. Cute atmosphere, staff was OKAY
Our hotel concierge recommended this place. We came in with our 9 month old and she seemed to really like the decor. Definitely a family friendly place. . I got a salad there that was a non-lettuce salad. I can't remember what it was called. But it had chicken, avocado, corn, chickpeas, and other goodies. oh my god. Seriously it was so good I couldn't put my fork down. . Husband got some pasta. He said it was good. He also had the deep fried oreo sundae, which we said was good too. I don't eat dairy, so no dessert for me. The desserts are definitely sharing size, though.
Sure enough, we came here for my dad's birthday dinner. We went to a high priced place the day before, and he preferred his favorite burger. He was also quite excited to see the discount with the Total Rewards card (a dollar or so off of different items).
Went here to grab a quick dinner late night while waiting for the Absenthe show to start.. . This place seems to be crowded all the time and was no exception when we went. We got lucky and found a couple seats at the bar to eat.. . Very colorful drink menu and dessert selection.. Affordable and decent quality food.. . Bartender was very attentive and friendly considering how busy it was.. . Good to take friends, date, coworkers. not the best place to take customers.. Need to have plenty of time if you plan to get a table b/c the place is typically crowded around dinner time. Don't know if you can do reservations but if possible, I would put in reservation first.
Loved the experience here.  Great location right next to the show we were going to.  Our server Karen was wonderful!  Food was very tasty!  It was fun to share the Frozen Hot chocolate with my sweetie!
5 stars for our wedding reception, 3 stars for our wedding anniversary a year later.. . Our reception was a lot of fun. We picked the menu in advance,  giving people a narrower choice of items, preset appetizers and desserts. They worked with me on creating a menu that would keep my friends and  family happy (we've got some picky eaters) and I was able to make requests like having two different appetizers with all of the sauces on the side. Service was good, too. We did have a little bit of a wait to be seated - bummer cause we had our reservation for months. But once we got in there, things were efficiently done. The food was good! Especially loved the steak sandwich and the Asian chicken salad. We had a great time and it made our wedding day even better.. . Er, but we didn't have such a great time when it was just my husband and I on our anniversary. It was a pretty ridiculous wait to get in and then we were seated inside, where everything is pepto pink and the noise level is awful. Our food took a while to get to us, and when it did, it was good but unimpresive. Our dessert was something with peanut butter...tasty but super rich and we couldn't even eat half of it. We didn't haveany serious complaints but we weren't planning any trips back, either.
Doesn't matter how good the food is, when service is that bad from someone because we have two groups of 5, nothing will make up for it. Bitchy attitude and the nerve to follow us outside and give us crap is unacceptable.
Food was great.  Our server was not so great. He seemed very smug. Didn't want to help us much. Worst service in all of vegas. Food was awesome though.
Wonderful place to go and share a sundae
My fiance took me to Serendipity in Dec. 2013. I LOVED their decor. It was so fun, and was not too fancy. It does say that you HAVE to have a reservation (online), so we made one... I really don't see why we needed to because it wasn't "that" busy. The food is amazing! I thought it was kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for :) A must have is their frozen hot chocolate... They have a huge section of all the different flavors; we stuck with original since we'd never had it before. I heard the s'mores hot chocolate is to die for. I'd recommend this fun restaraunt to a friend for sure.
Love the frozen hot chocolates but the service was really bad for us!! We sat down and waited for ten minutes and had to flag someone down to ask to take our order. "I'll find a server for you."  was his response. A family sat down right after and a server tended to them right away. We looked around and noticed that we were the minorities. Id hate to pull the race card but thats how I'm perceiving it. Disappointed is what I am.
Once was enough for me. I am not coming back.. . Not only is the service terrible, but the food is vastly overpriced, even for the strip. I waited about 40 minutes for ONE very simple, yet expensive dessert. I expected the quality to at least be great, but it was sightly above average at best. Nobody in my group was impressed.. . In addition, a few of my friends recently received melted ice cream from this place. For a restaurant that is known for its desserts, that is unacceptable. Never mind, that should be unacceptable everywhere!. . Satisfy your sweet tooth somewhere else.
I had a ordered a pizza, it was way too small & overly priced!. The sauce was awful. I only liked the topping.. I order a drink which was decent.. The interior is 3/5. Needs new flooring.. It was kind of crowded, tables are too close to each other and hard to get around.
Went back with some friends for some Frozen Hot Chocolate and some huge Cheese cakes. Some 10 friends to be exact and that was the problem right there. They have a policy of $25/person fee or something like that for groups 10 or more, which is ridiculous. So we split in 2 groups of 5. And we were seated one after another at tables far apart. But the table next to us was open so the other group moved there and were close. Well, you can't do that apparently, we got some sh!t for that and a guy from the other group got up and left (we didn't know he wasn't coming back until later, otherwise we would all have left). Too bad that their Chocolatini is good and the cakes and stuff, but this is the kind of experience that you don't come back for.
This place in placed right outside Caesars Palace, so it's in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. I have been here a few times and both the service and the food here has varied quite a bit. There is often a waiting list here in the summer, so prepare not to be seated right away. Before I thought it was worth it since the service was better and the food better than now. I will probably end up going here again, but it's not a place I would recommend unless you are right outside Caesars. Or maybe if you are going to see the very enjoyable show Absinte that is as close as it get.
TOURIST TRAP WARNING!!!!  So not worth all the hype. Regular ice cream, regular luke warm chocolate, regular luke warm coffee with a dash of cinnamon - oh, I know why I'm giving the 2nd star, because of the other servers who extended great customer service experience - cause ours (Karen K) seemed to be very angry with the world & pretended to be courteous to us.  I kinda felt bad for her in a way.  What's happening to quality service today? Augh! #fatbill #badservice
Overpriced and overrated! I ordered the "fried oreo sundae" and I received it halfway melted. I also ordered a burger which tasted mediocre at its best. My boyfriend ordered the frozen hot chocolate, and that also tasted disgusting. . . I truely wonder who hired the staff because the customer service, is horrible.
Everything about this place is excellent. Prices are reasonable, food quality is unreal...and the desserts are among the best I've ever had. Even if you're full by the time you finish, find room for a shake. You'll be glad you did!
This my obligatory stop in Vegas. Maybe the past 5 years I have visited Vegas, my friends and I make it a point to grab lunch here. My main problem is the long wait. Any and every time I have stopped in here there is a good hour wait and it's a waste of time, however once you are seated, the wait is completely worth it.. . The food is incredible. I have tried their burgers, pizzas and sandwiches- all to die for. You cannot leave this place without dessert, as this is what they are known for. I would recommend their famous frozen hot chocolate. We also tried their layered chocolate cake, which was AMAZING.. . I love the ambiance of the place, very Alice In Wonderland-ish, the staff is really nice and very upbeat. I love that it's located right on the strip so it's close to everything. I just wish it wasn't so damn popular so we wouldn't always have to wait to be seated!!!
Expect higher than average prices since it's part of Caesar's. However the prices are not bad at all for the quality of food. . I ordered a BBQ and Blue Cheese Burger and a Chicken Caesar Salad. Both were generous in their meat. The burger was one of the best I've had with a good, thick patty. The salad wasn't as tossed together or cut as I expected, but the chicken breast was a good portion and tasted great.. If you're at Caesar's and looking for more reasonably-priced dishes, I'd stop here.
Love Serendipity and a must when visiting Vegas!  I originally went for their famous Frozzen Hot Chocolate (they are amazing) but was surprised by how good the food is too!  If there's a wait for tables, sit at the bar.  Daisy at the bar is amazing and will take great care of you!  We now go back just because of her.
Pros: . Large portions, it's overlooking the Vegas strip, and it's in front of Caesars Palace.. . . Cons: . The price and the branding (it's kinda confusing with cultural symbols).. . Food Experience:. I had the steak sandwich because I always crave steak but of course there were no pictures and our server just said alright with no warning of the size of this monster. It could literally be split into 4 and I would be full. I felt guilty eating half of it lol. However my price raised when I ordered ONE mimosa.. . Conclusion:. I would recommend this place if it weren't so darn pricey however it is cheaper then most nicer places in Vegas. So it's up to y'all!
Not bad, everything I wanted order there were out of. Had to order other things. After I did in the pick up line for 10 min. Need signs!! Bathrooms need a good scrubbing. I do like the outside atmosphere. Hot dog was ok, fries cold. But impressed, 3 stars because of they have stone
The strawberry fields and Deep Fried Oreos ice cream are my two favorites here!! I only came here for dessert! Don't know to much about the food here! Nice location in front of CP casino. Lots of tables outside to sit and people watch while you're enjoying.. Menu almost everything is $20 buck so it's pricey here!
Yelp definitely steered us in the right direction on this one--headed straight for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate....mm-mm good!!  Yes, its overpriced, but so worth it.  We got the "double" which means double chocolate (not so obvious on the menu).  It's also got a cute, kinda retro look to the place.  Try to go off season/midweek/off times or better yet, all of the above, as they don't take reservations and lines can be long. Easy to find, as it's right in front of Caesar's--you will see it if you are walking or driving down the strip. Picked up a canister of the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix to take home, which includes prep. instructions.  Staff member ( can't remember his name) told us to make it into "double hot chocolate": combine 2 scoops of choc. ice cream,  2+ Tablespoons (preferrably dark-- Ghiradelli, etc.) chocolate syrup and 1 to 1 1/2 cups ice in blender...good luck!
I love it here!  I usually go just for dessert, but the food is also wonderful.  I also love the atmosphere of the place.  It's colorful and fun.  I've never had a bad experience.  Be warned:  the portions are huge!!  Either share or you will be definitely having leftovers for days.
I've been to all of the Serendipty 3's in the u.S and I have to say, Las Vegas was my favorite! The atmosphere is much newer and cleaner but most importantly, their customer service was the best and everything just seemed so much bigger in Vegas! I can't wait to come back to get the humongous slice of chocolate cake!. However, I am only giving this place 4 stars because the actual food is only okay.. Nothing really special... but this place is definitely a good dessert spot!
Wow! This is some of the best desserts I have ever had. Frozen Hot Chocolate sounds crazy but it is so good. You wonder what it is but it is just that frozen hot chocolate. That really does describe it. So chocolaty and good. Then fried Oreos in cookies n cream ice cream sundae. So good. I have always wanted to try fried Oreos. They were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. With the ice cream it was a great combination.. Be warned, watch the sizes. They don't mess around here. A small is huge and a huge is insane. Between me and my girlfriend we could not finish a small of either one.. Now this is an ice cream parlor. Yes they serve food but it is just ok. It is good don't get me wrong but their thing is ice cream and that is what you came for anyway. We got the nachos. I love the big chips. Again they don't do small here. They had lots of cheese and meat. It was warm and gooey and good but not great. Again ice cream place. I have said it before if you go to the burger place you don't order tacos or go to a steakhouse and order fish. You came to an ice cream parlor for ice cream.. Do yourself a favor and get the Frozen Hot Chocolate if you have never had it. If you have I don't need to tell you because you already ordered it. It is something that they came up with and is one of the best ideas ever.. We will be back for sure. This is a great place for dessert. Really is the best ice cream around.
Three stars only because the Crab Cake Sandwich was delicious. The fries met expectations, though the tartar sauce (?), I assume, had an aftertaste because of the metallic containment it was in. . . Even though the food was good and the prices were cheaper than I had expected since it is on the strip, my server wasn't up to par. If you sit inside, depending on where they seat you, you could possibly see the kitchen. I was disappointed that my server was touching her hair and face in the back of house area without washing her hands before handling our food. Though hair wasn't found on our plates, The lack of cleanliness was disappointing. Being in the f&b industry, and super anal about maintaining my professional, cleanly appearance, this was a definite turn-off. She wasn't personable at all, and treated my friend and I as if we were just young girls, as is familiar. She brought us water with apparent melted ice that indicated it was sitting there for a while. We asked for ice in the water for both of us, she brought us two new cups with ice filled to the rim. As I finished my food, she took away my plate and presented us with a check when my friend wasn't even half-way done with the meal; we might as well have ordered to-go! I still tipped her 20% just because I know tips are what we work for, but she definitely didn't deserve it. A meal is less appreciated when the service sucks.. . Also, by all the other reviews I get from this place, by Yelpers, friends and family alike, I expected a better surrounding. The decor didn't live up Caesars palace. It was confusing figuring out whether the hostess was outside or inside. It was very awkward.. . I would still eat here again. And I'm sad I didn't try the frozen hot chocolate. Or the 1000$ gold sundae. Kidding. :P
Triple Decker Grilled Cheese, that is what my eyes focused on. The portion size was larger than that I originally thought. Honestly, one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in a very long time. I opted to get the tomato soup, and it was good to dunk the sandwich in. My sis and I ordered the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate, and it was just what we needed to cure our craving. It was a bit crazy with the location under construction, and we couldn't even find our server to get a box and check. Though, I would return, but I would probably order from the togo window or wait until the location is fully renovated.
