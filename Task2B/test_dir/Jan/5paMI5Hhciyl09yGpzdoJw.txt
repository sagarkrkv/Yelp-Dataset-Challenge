As a long time Vegas visitor, I haven't had one of these moments that I've been surprised like this. I gamble and gamble a lot where I decided to come with friends for the New Year Celebration as well as two 30th birthday celebrations. . . As a LA native, Vegas is one of those things we decide to go on a last minute decision with our attendance ranging anywhere from 5-15 times a year. I know, it's crazy. So I've been recently staying at the MGM, Wynn and Cosmo lately because of the ease to head back to our rooms at the better clubs. Why can't the Venetian build a new, better club! Help me, help you! Anyways, so we ended up getting a room here where I use to frequent this place a lot as I got 5 star treatment as a gambler here. I come with my buddies on this trip, decide not to do any comp stuff and just enjoy our time here. . . We get a connecting Sienna Suite with a connect room for a few friends. Nothing crazy but keep in mind we were still spending $1,000+ a night. Now, I know this isn't vegas baller status but it's also a good amount of money. We decided to stay here again since my friend and I were Intercontinental Ambassador members. So we come NYE and find out our rooms are connected. What's the point of this then right? We were pretty upset where either the IHG guys or Palazoo messed up. Either way, let's get it right? We stay at these nicer places because of the service they provide. . . After some long searching and apologizing, we're told that there's no other options for the night but they can look into it tomorrow. Not the way we wanted to celebrate a 30th bday celebration as well as New Years with separated room.. . I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed at this point as I always told people I loved Venetian and Palazzo. Fast forward to the next morning, we weren't able to get the room again and after some searching, they found a even better solution. A bigger, nicer way better room to make it up.. . What I loved the most wasn't the fact that we got upgraded as we've been in these rooms before but how the front desk Receptionist, Jonathan took control of it. The guys is young and with the help of him and is manager, they stepped up and proved why you stay at places like the Venetian. My friends were talking A LOT of crap after the first night where this really made up for it.. . Most importantly, I loved how Jonathan really understood we were there to celebrate with friends and wanted to be together. These days are numbered as we venture of to our families and careers where these moments are more and more rare. We were able to stay in this suite with all of our friends and just have a good time. . . I been a manager for several fortune 50 companies where I would love to have an employee like Jonathan. He stepped up, handled our fustration and made sure we were able to reach him throughout the moving and changes. . . I was really impressed how it turned out with Jonathan and his manager who really reinforced our faith in the Venetian. The truth is that many visitors have some many choices now where service like this is important. We know we're not the high rollers or whales but we appreciated being treated like value guests.
nice room,they lack of a buffet here,hot swimming pool A++
Been to Vegas since I was a small toddler and even for my brother, Las Vegas has sure changed in many ways. I have stayed in many casino and resorts, and the Palazzo is definitely the resort to stay at. We have been a loyal customer since the Venetian opened, then the Venezia, and now the Palazzo. I feel the Palazzo is better than the Venetian (after the venetian had remodeled). When I am at the Palazzo, I feel a bit of the Venezia Tower is there. The casino on the lower floor is very airy and I feel comfortable gambling here. Its definitely more comfortable than the Venetian. I feel the Venetian has changed and it's very crowded and warm there. The Palazzo is very laid-back and easy going. I love the ambience of what the Palazzo has to offer. The restaurants also bring a great vibe. I love eating at the grand lux cafe at the palazzo rather than the venetian. The palazzo is a great casino, overall. It surpasses the Venetian.
My sister in law booked us rooms here in the palazzo and it was beautifully stunning!! Everything was so beautiful here and the service was perfect! I can't wait to come here again!
This is one of our favorite hotels in Las Vegas.  The suites are large and comfortable with everything we need and a nice view of the strip.  There are so many shopping and dining options in the Palazzo and it is connected to the Venetian which is my favorite poker room.  I like that it is close to the Fashion Show mall and other nice resorts.  I also love the Canyon Ranch Spa which is probably one of the best spas in town.
Palazzo is hands down my favorite hotel on the strip! My cousin and I were both in Vegas at the same time. She stayed at MGM and paid the same amount for a room half the size. Palazzo has such a friendly staff, huge rooms, and amazing decor. Can't wait to comeback!
It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.
The weather in Chicago has been so unpleasant that I needed to pack my bags the other night and head to Vegas.  I have stayed at the Palazzo before and have been generally pleased.  Upon arrival I was up to my room in under 20 minutes and at the Blackjack table within 40 minutes.  This is a large property, but it doesn't take you forever to get from point A to B.  The casino hosts a pleasant clientele (ie:  not too much riff raff).  Bouchon is always a good choice for breakfast and they also have a small take out counter if you're strolling in from a late night on the town and need a pastry or croissant to settle your stomach.. The sports book / lagasse restaurant is good, not great.  I have been in the summer before andenjoyed the cabanas at azure, but I do feel a bit old and out of shape for the pool party.  Whatever, order one of the giant punch bowls and you will feel fine after a few.. Finally, the rooms are A-OK.  I have been in the standard rooms and they are nothing note worthy.  This trip I was in the sienna tower which seemed a little roomier and was comfortable. . This is centrally located and there is plenty of shopping to distract your wife if you're on a hot streak.. Wifi sucks here!  I complained and they comped my resort fee.
clean, big, quite... good thing for me was there are 2 gyms. it was whole lot better than 24HR fitness center.
What's LEFT is RIGHT and what's RIGHT is LEFT. This is Europe, folks. Italy. Escalator heaven, oodles and oodles of noodles, canals and fake sky. oh-oh, and the floral scent. Don't get me started with hotel/casino scents.. . The Palazzo is my most visited hotel/casino in Vegas and I'm NOT sick of it. It's a good breakaway from the MGM/Mandalay/NYNY/Excalibur 'bubble.". . The Palazzo and Venetian are connected. Two hotel/casino's as one...with two floors of entertainment, great food and fun. Level one is Casino's, restaurants and bars. Level two is shops, more restaurants and more bars.. . Hey, sports fan.... located on the Palazzo side is Lagasse's Stadium (formerly Jay-Z's 20-20 Club). Lagasse's Stadium is the most amazing, plush sports oriented environment I've ever seen. Check it out. Not easy to find. On the Venetian side, the sports book has the clearest big screen in Vegas, but the seating consist of private booths. Not the best seating for your average audience. It's a damn shame.. . During the summer, I may chose Mandalay or MGM for the pool.
Fantastic resort to stay at while in Vegas. I stayed twice this year, the rooms are top notch, the service is great, even the room service food was fantastic. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that they can be a bit too pricey so make sure to look for deals and if you can find some to be had then by all means go. You have access to so many things onsite between the Palazzo and the Venetian.
