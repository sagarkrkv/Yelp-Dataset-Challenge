Went here for new years to see kaskade. Or so we thought. Me and my friends were approached by a few guys that wanted to walk in with us because the ratio was better so they'd have to pay 200 instead of the regular $300. Well apparently these guys had already tried to get in and the asshole bouncer accused us of "trying to sneak guys in" and told us he shouldn't even let us in. Uhh please explain to me how we're "sneaking guys in" if they still have to pay $200. Ok really not the way to treat your clientele that are making you the most money. So we get through to the outdoor part of the club and apparently we don't have the right stamp to get on the dance floor. And neither do most people including huge groups of girls. So it's December in the desert late at night and you're not letting people inside. More like girls that you would want to pack the club with. Xs please work on your customer service. Skip this place if you're here during the winter. I'd rather be at marquee.
Honestly I see so many people give vegas clubs less stars because they complain that it was soooo crowded. . Then why are you in vegas? go home! obviously its going to be crowded. 1. its vegas. 2. who wants to go to a dead looking club? not me!  I understand if the architecture of the place makes it worse but I don't think thats the case with XS.. . Anyways I really love XS, I have come to XS every time I go to Vegas so far. The first time they didn't really have a big name DJ playing but Surrender did. And we went to XS first the line was sooo long but thank god we were a group of 8-9 hot girls ;) hehehe I love my friends. I get free stuff just by being with them heehee.  Anyways. we went to Surrender around 1:30 since its in the same hotel thing. but it was not crackin AT ALL. I stayed maybe 30-40minutes and bounced back to XS. Way more people and way more fun! woohoo! . . The second time I went was during Christmas break time and Morgan Page was playing and it was poppin AGAIN! I texted Dave and got on his line and this time I was able to get two guys in with us fo fweeee~ and of course the free drink tickets yay! thanks dave! Once again hella crackin and a decent crowd. LADIES! there are poles to dance on ;) LOLL. but yea I always run into people I know at XS. Another great night! yay! . . XS ... momma will be coming back home to you soon!
My favorite club in Vegas! Great music, vibe, crowd, and venue. Indoor and outdoor, love it!
The club is of course beautiful inside and outside in the pool area. We went there to see david guetta and it ended up being a. Very good night and we all (group of 15 ppl) enjoyed it a lot.. . So why only 3 starts? I have been to many clubs inside us and overseas and  dont have any issue with overcrowded clubs and understand that this is to be expected in known clubs especially if there is a big name in the house. But this was to another level they had oversold the tickets and there were so many people inside that we couldnt move (im not talking about the dancefloor) it would take us 10 minutes to move 20-30 ft it was ridiculous. This went on for a couple of hours but it got a lot better by the mid of his set i think a lot of ppl just got mad and left. I suggest they increase their prices but sell less number of tickets
XS will forever be my favorite club in Las Vegas. . . A little smaller, a little more intimate and what I believe started my liking for a lot of DJs. I highly recommend you contact a promoter so you can purchase cheaper tickets before. From what I remembered there is more than one bar. It isn't so stuffy because behind the DJ Stage is a opening for fresh air. . . One downside about this club are the lights. There isn't much a light-show going as Light but wait for it.... there is a mini pool outside that girls (guys sorry, no splashing in the water for you) can play in. Yes, that's right I said it. We can play in the water if we want. . . A lot of girls who can't handle the high heels, rest here and splash their stanky feet in here so I wouldn't recommend taking a dive. But it's a little perk for girls who come to Vegas from March-Aug. . . Whenever I come here I always having a blast. A must!
Pretty cool place got to see Avici upclose and got in free not a bad place at all.
XS is my favorite club in Las Vegas. I am a local and every time I go out I go to XS!. . I usually go in on the guest list so that entry is free and I get drink tickets (which are good for premiumdrinks btw!!!) . . And the club is always busy and fun! It's gorgeous inside so I usually end up taking a bunch of pictures. Plus they have the best DJ's. If you've never seen Diplo live you are missing out. . . I went on New Year's Eve to see Kaskade and it literally changed my life. I love this nightclub so much. It's classy and filled with all the right people, but not snobby either. . . Whenever I go I use Michelle's guest list. She's awesome!! If you're going def text her at 908-770-3570. That girl always hooks me up at XS!!! . . If you are in Vegas you HAVE to check it out.
Contact Rachel if you want to be on the GL for this place. She hooked it up for me and my girlfriends the last time I was in Vegas. She was very responsive and friendly!  I would def hit her up next time I'm in vegas! +1 702-557-4160
In a 5 star hotel, a better consumer  is expected. these guys think just because they earn money, they can do whatever they want. No more business for them is a good punishment.
Best of the best. No other way to put it. . . Wynncore group knows how to go all out. Marquee is good, Light is great, but XS is simply the best. I always have an amazing time here and it does not disappoint. I've done bottle service and general admission and had great times either way. Presale tickets are the easiest, but if you can get enough people together to get bottles, its totally worth it. . . Top notch DJs as well!
I been coming to XS for years and have never had issues getting in with pre sale tickets until lately. Seems like if you have pre sale tickets you will wait a long time. What's going on XS??
