Great food. Been here three times and will keep coming here whenever I'm in town. . As usual, the beef tongue is delicious. It's a must. Then there's miso butterfish & agedashi tofu.. This time we added salmon belly, garlic book choy, and stir fried pork with napa cabbage and shitake mushroom. All are yummy! The salmon belly melts in your mouth the second you put it in.. And of course you have to end it with the honey toast!. I don't give 5 stars because the place is always too crowded and they're always overwhelmed. You always have to get their attention every time you need something.
Ichiza is my favorite restaurant on the planet. When I first started coming here ten years ago, I was generally the only white person in the restaurant. Recognizing that my presence was probably bad for business, they always seated me in the back near the restrooms, regardless of how empty the restaurant was. I can respect this kind of racism and have been a loyal customer ever since.. . The menu only lists about 1/5 of the items available; the rest are written on pieces of paper taped to the walls. It is truly a dizzying number of choices, but that is part of the beauty of Ichiza. Though ordering randomly isn't the worst idea, here are few suggestions to get started: red snapper carpaccio, grilled corn, bacon wrapped mochi, pork with shiso leaf, tofu salad with tuna sashimi, garlic baby bok choy, and wagyu beef fried rice. If you still have room for dessert, the honey toast is a unique experience, best for parties of three or more (or as a meal on its own for two).. . I would eat here at almost any price, but the fact is it's amazing affordable. You can eat like a hog for about $20 per person. It's also a great late-night choice, open until 3 or 4am, depending on the night. On the off chance it's closed, head west a few blocks to Pho Kim Long for great Vietnamese food.
Discovered this place accidentally when I was on the prowl to satisfy my ramen needs. It was after midnight and the place was jammed packed with people waiting outside in the friggin' cold! BEST ACCIDENT EVER! Ramen DX to die for. Spicy tuna roll of perfection no other have thus far been able to live up to. Seaweed salad, hot green tea, superb selection of sake, and butter clams ubber yummy! I try to try a new dish every visit. Well unless I order togo, which is several times a week. SMH 30 min trip one way for this Fab Food Heaven? Oh F*** Yes!
Honey toast the size of your head!! Need I say more? Oh and it tastes really good too :) . . This is a pretty darn good izakaya and one of my go-to places to eat when I'm in town. I wish that they could stay open later than 3, but I would totally ditch the club early to eat here.. . A couple of my favs include beef tataki (a must), beef bowl (when they don't run out for the day), karaage, spicy tuna rolls, and sometimes ramen. I'm even a sucker for that peach sparkling sake thing that I can't seem to find anywhere else! . . Service is always attentive even when we come during the busy times. Don't forget to end your meal with an order of the honey toast!!
Love this place!!! Exclamation points galore!!! This is one of my fave Japanese restaurants. Their menu is so extensive.. and it is constantly being updated withnew items. Everything from sushi, rolls, salads, soups, tonkatsu, ramen, noodles, yakitori to delicious desserts. This place serves authentic Japanese cuisines. Love the traditional and authentic Japanese decor and "pub-like" feel. Prices are reasonable. If you're in Vegas - forget the buffets - this is one place you'll want to visit. The honey-toast dessert is a MUST-HAVE. (I think you'll agree my photos speak for themselves!) . . Pros: Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Great customer service. Authentic Japanese vibe. Very reasonable prices. Open late. Casual dress. . . Cons: Place is always packed and you'll probably have to wait, but this place is worth the wait.
Vegas Ramen Quest #3 of 3 days in a row...  This restaurant stood out.  Not for the ramen, but for all its other dishes.  . . Fantastic Japanese restaurant with a huge variety of offerings.  Peruse the menu, browse pics on Yelp and find yourself reading all the litter on the walls, featuring everything else you'd like to order.  This, was annoying.  Lovely decor, but Monkey don't want to read the walls to figure out what to order, especially when trying to read over other tables.  There are Yelp pictures of stuff we wanted that are not on the menu.  Server was very helpful to narrow down what it was we were looking for.  . . #91 RAMEN DX - good, but still falls below Monkey's Gold Standard of Ramen, LA's Daikokuya.  In fact, I'm writing this 2 weeks later and I can't remember anything worth mentioning about this ramen. . YELLOWTAIL TARTARE - Now this blew our minds when it arrived to our table!  Order it and be amazed.  There are bottles of wine we reserve to celebrate with, this dish my wife insists I only order with her.  . FRIED OYSTERS - Monkey don't do fried oysters and this didn't change my mind. #45 BEEF TONGUE SKEWER - This arrived first.  Savory, chewy, delicious.  Think marinated beef chewing gum.  Can you imagine?  Monkey loved masticating this sliver of cow tongue. Ever see a monkey make out with a cow?  Loved it so much we ordered another skewer to finish us off, instead of dessert. #87 BROILED RICE BALLS - If you love the toasted rice at the bottom of your stone pot bibimbap, you will absolutely order this.  Imagine two tennis ball-sized triangles of rice, toasted crisp on all sides and probably brushed with soy sauce.  Fantastic, but oh too salty for Monkey.  Will definitely order again with less salt.  . . Open every day 230pm - 3AM ! ! !  Great place for after drinking/partying or sampling different items while drinking...  Monkey cannot wait to return!
Best izakaya in the US.  we are from Japan and this place maybe better than some of Izakaya in Japan.  We will see them in our next visit to Vegas!!
Oishi!. . Delicious is the only word needed to describe Ichiza. After we finished a tradeshow on the strip, some of our Japanese colleagues wanted to bring us here to celebrate a successful show. When 3 Japanese guys speak passionately about Japanese cuisine in America, you listen!. . We had all manner of sashimi, as well as some cooked dishes whose names I can't recall. The flying fish sashimi was particularly memorable. The server even fried up the head for us, and even *THAT* was delicious!. . And if you're not an adventurous eater... they serve beer by the pitcher and have some pretty great sake as well. There ought to be something for everyone at Ichiza!
Everytime I've been here its amazing! I highly recommend going! You will not be disappointed.  Prices are good and even on the cheap side.
Ummmmm good. . I don't go to vegas much but when I do I make effort to go to ichiza.  Its been a year since i went but still remember it fondly.  I've never been to Japan but when I go I hope the food is like this.  One of my favorite japanese restaurants  I  hold in similar regard as Domo in Denver.
This is a one of a kind Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas. A lot of other Japanese restaurants offer sushi as their specialty. Here you will find many other unique items on the menu. Having been to Japan where freshness, presentation, and simplicity of the entrees (meaning they don't mix too many ingredients that it takes away from the main ingredient in the dish instead of complimenting it) are what is showcased, this place truly matches up.. . Try the sauteed beef tongue (or just beef for the less adventurous), tofu steak, Jalapeno fried rice, and tofu mousse for dessert. There are so many other things on the menu or off the wall  that are great, that you can try a new dish every time you go and you wont be disappointed!
Japanese run restaurant in Chinatown with private seating option...sounds like adventure? Sure was. I didn't want those fake Japanese teppanyaki sushi joint on strip, and I read a review of Ichiza on Japanese blog. . . You walk on and it's complete Izakaya experience. Japanese manager sitting at counter and cute Japanese waitress with high pitch voice repeating orders...I got my hope high. . . Menus was very authentic Izakaya menus. You don't see crap like California roll or Kobe this and that. . . Sat on counter with my client, we had good time feeling like back in Japan. . . Food quality, however, was hit and miss. Small appt dishes were all good, ramen was too soy saucy. But hey, this is Vegas put of nowhere and we were thankful for this innovative guy running true Essenes of Izakaya business.. . Majority of customers here are Chinese or Europeans, only japanese are the actual people working...interesting eh?
A little pricey (if you eat a ton of sushi, like I do) but definitely worth it! Not someplace I come to on a daily basis, more like a splurge or a special occasion. I've brought several friends here and have converted them into Ichiza lovers too. Great food, quality ingredients, cool atmosphere, what more do you want?
Ah, I finally found somewhere delicious, reasonably-priced, and comfortable for dinner in Las Vegas.  Having the beef bowl, having finished the Cold Spinach in Sweet Sesame Sauce appetizer.  I'll come here again.
KF = Kid Friendly (at a decent hour). . I've been here with / without kids over a dozen times. I am never hungry or disappointed at the end of our meal. Sometimes we have to wait, but again, with kids it's not worth waiting unless there is something to look forward to. My kids are adventurous, so slimy and raw is perfectly acceptable. However, there are a lot of KF basics such as tempura, calamari, beef and chicken and if that is not acceptable, you can just head up Spring Mountain and hit McDonald's. . Our personal faves:. - beef tataki (I get 2 orders because I don't like to share this ;). - calamari - nice and crispy, but if they get rid of the garnishing they can add a few more rings. - pork belly bowl - my 6 year-old won't share this. - beef tongue - yep I said beef tongue. So tender and tasty that tongue is.. - bacon wrapped mochi - who knew?. - mackerel sashimi. - red snapper carpaccio. - sakana pinchos - inside out roll. - yellowtail tartar. - honey toast - if you have room, but we usually get Boba downstairs at Tea Station ;). And as always parents, don't forget to drink a lot of sake!
This is a great izakaya place with a huge authentic menu and lots of specials.. . I came here with a bunch of friends after a day of climbing at Red Rocks. We had made a reservation in advance since one of our friends had been here before and we knew it would get packed quickly. It's located upstairs in a vanilla strip mall, but don't let the exterior deter you!. . It's already been a few weeks, so I can't remember all the dishes we ordered. A few highlights:. . Miso black cod: Nice and subtle flavor. Lightly broiled.. . Garlic steak fried rice: Sooo good. A must. Better than the kimchi fried rice.. . Honey toast: Save room for this. You'll thank me later.
I have been enjoying this place every time I visit over 10 years.  I feel like I am at my hometown in Japan.. . However, I noticed a quality of the dishes were not good as before.  There were only few Japanese restaurants ten years ago in town, we were so happy and appreciated to have their dishes, now there are tons to choose from, similar/better restaurants out there to enjoy.. . I still hope Ichiza will be back as our favorite true Japanese izakaya soon.
So, this isn't the fanciest place, but it is pretty darn good! The menu is HUGE, and then all of a sudden, you notice a ton of specials on the walls. It is a bit overwhelming, but everything is priced so reasonably, that you can easily order a few (or several) things and still pay less than you would on the Strip.. . I ordered the crab fried rice (yum), the deep fried octopus (same thing as fried calamari), and sampled a bunch of things that my friends ordered (raman, grilled squid, mackerel) . I was pleased with everything. They also have an extensive sake menu. I tried the "reisling style" sake, and the presentation was very strange. My glass was inside of a little box, and she overfilled the sake glass so it overflowed into the box. So, when I finished my glass, I just poured the liquid in the box into my glass. Odd... The sake actually tasted just like Reisling, so it wasn't really worth $10, but oh well.... . Next time, I'll be more adventurous and order some other, less conventional, items. I enjoyed my time here, though!
Mmmm Ichiza... one of the best spots for Japanese eats in Chinatown.. . Ichiza has been long considered to be one the better and most authentic Japanese restaurants in town. I am no fan of seafood and thus Japanese cuisine is something I rarely get excited about but that all changes when I set foot inside Ichiza.. . The restaurant itself is something I would imagine to be right out of Japan. Small and cramped but cozy, daily specials written in Kanji and English adorn the walls. The staff is super friendly and always have great recommendations. There's a small tatami area off to the side which is a nice touch. Ichiza's sake selection is pretty good and the sushi bar is definitely worth checking out.. . The chicken and egg bowl is my personal favorite. Its a little like a teriyaki bowl with sliced chicken breast and egg scrambled in. Top it off with some sriracha; tasty and healthy! Now on to the infamous honey toast! This is probably their most popular dish and huge reason alot of people return. The dessert is a large cube of toasted bread with scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. Though it may sound weird, the honey toast is absolutely delicious and a must try for any first-time visitor.. . Ichiza is a must for any Chinatown trip.
