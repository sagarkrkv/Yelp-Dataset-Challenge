This really is as good as it gets.. . I have been a Vegas traveler since I was a kid. Yes, we stayed at Circus Circus, but hey, that hotel was the BEST back in the early 90s! :) Anyway, I have stayed at a LOT of nicer hotels since then: Luxor, Tropicana, Vdara, Aria, Excalibur, Planet Hollywood, Paris, and the Palazzo.  . . For this brief Vegas trip (one night), I was shocked at how good of a deal the Cosmo was having for the day after Christmas.  I booked a regular room with two double beds and it was $153 with tax and the resort fee, which, for Vegas and staying in the City Center, is pretty darn good.. . Anyway, we arrived super late around 5pm, and the lady saw my fiance and I and asked if we still wanted the double bed room.  I told her that if there was a room with a king bed and a free upgrade, that would be great, as my fiance had never been to Vegas before. I was shocked by what happened next. She said she would upgrade us to the Terrace Suite room at no charge. If we wanted to face the city, she said it would be extra, but we were totally happy with the Terrace Suite (Who wouldn't be?!). . When we got up to the room, it really was a beautiful room.  The best thing about the Cosmo is that they are the only hotel on the Strip right now that actually has rooms with balconies (terraces).  No other hotel on the Strip has this, yet, and it really makes a difference.  We had a beautiful view of the Aria and the rest of the City Center as well as some view of the mountains.  In addition, the decor is VERY chic. You really feel like you are in a different world when you step into the room.  . . The free WiFi with the resort fee worked great and we were really happy to have had that as we were able to use our laptops from the comfort of our room.  Asfor the work out facility (you better believe I was going to take FULL advantage of this after paying $25 for the resort fee!), it was very nice.  They will give headphones if you need them for free (not the highest quality but still a nice touch).  They had a separate area to do mat work, a boxing area (which was hilarious because people were boxing), tennis courts outside, machines for lifting, free weights, and, of course, tread mills and other running machines.   This facility was open for most of the day but they have another one in the East Tower that is open 24 hours a day.  I didn't check this one out because we stayed in the West Tower, but I can only imagine what that facility had in store for its guests!. . The pools were being cleaned because they are outside and are closed for the winter months, but I went outside to view them and they seemed pretty nice as well.  Lots of space to sit outside, so I bet it is packed in the summer months.. . Overall, definitely worth it to stay here.  The casino does not smell like smoke, as some of the older casinos seem to do so.  If you're into the going out scene, Marquee is here as well and, though we did not go this time, it is pretty chic and you can easily get in if you find a promoter around the Cosmo or online.
Had a wonderful opportunity to spend NYE in a fabulous 2 bedroom suite.  My friend was invited to spend NYE and he invited us to experience Cosmo for the first time.  I really like the hotel and will definitely return.. Location/Hotel:  Great location at City Center.  Everything is near by and within walking distance. The hotel is still relatively new (3 years) and is still fresh.  The whole hotel has a different vibe than the other ones I frequently visit (Venetian, Aria, and Palazzo).  The vibe is more hip and upscale.  Not really a snooty feel, but they definitely know they are the sh*t.  The hotel is not terribly large and I kind of like that.  You can get from one side of the resort to the other in a relatively short time frame.  If going from west tower to restaurants, I suggest walking on the second/third floor to bypass the traffic on the casino floor.. Room:  We stayed in a 2 bedroom (wrap around suite with connecting terrace suite 44th floor) on the west tower.  There was never really a guard checking for room keys.  You are required to insert your room key in the elevator before you can press the button.  Sometimes the room key doesn't activate the elevator and it is a kind of a pain.  The room was very nice.  I loved the fact that the room had a full kitchen.  There were no pots/pans/plates to use with the kitchen (you could probably ask for it though).  The minibar price was def overpriced, so I would suggest bringing in your own beverage.  The rooms had nice modern electronic components but no iphone dock or sound system in the whole suite.  The terrace was great and offered an awesome view of the strip.  There was 3 full baths in the suite.  I loved the bathroom in the terrace suite.  The japanese soaking tub was too small for a grown man...but had a fabulous view.  I loved how the shower and tub was in the same area and you could walk out of the tub and straight into the shower.  There were great bathroom amenities.  Beds were really comfortable but once again, no ipod dock or charging station.  Another complaint that I had was that the light switches were a little confusing.  There was a main switch but then each individual light had one too but was confusing to turn on and off (maybe it was just me).  All in all, I really really loved the room.  . Service:  Decent.  However, biggest complaint was the long long long wait for room service to pick up the phone.  I literally waited 15 mins, hung up, and called the operator to help me.  Unacceptable.. Restaurant:  Lots of good choices.  But no fast food options.  Best place for a fast grub is the secret pizza restaurant.  . . The casino floor was not terribly big but was a perfect size.. . I would definitely return.
This place is EVERYTHING right now. I stayed for three nights for a guys trip for a friends birthday. We had two rooms. One was a Lanai Suite for the birthday boy, the other a standard city room for the rest of us. I was disappointed that there was no room with a balcony for the city room, but thats nit-picky. . . The building, its casino, its restaurants, clubs, access to the strip are all incredibly fantastic, and the layout and flow of traffic was clearly well thought out and executed extremely well. . . After staying here, I won't stay anywhere else. And I've stayed at just about all the other "nice" places on the strip. . . The pros: Great rooms with fantastic beds. The beds they have are the best I've ever slept on in Vegas. The bathroom, even in the basic room, was large and terrific, with the window between the shower and the bedroom. Great TV, room was big enough, stylish and well appointed. Definitely did the trick. . . The cons: Service was totally hit or miss. The front desk employees and especially room service representatives were AMAZING. Like bend over backwards kind of people. However, calling the concierge (which is the only department you can reach to get general help) takes forever. We'd call for something and the phone rings, and rings, and rings. Over and over again. That was irritating beyond belief when you are delaying your plans by waiting for the concierge to answer. We didn't have a TV remote in our room upon check in, and it took 3 calls to get one delivered. . . Also, we partied all night, and slept much of the day. As such, we put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and skipped the daytime housekeeping. We calledeach night around 8pm asking for housekeeping to come sometime between 8pm-2am, and they never came, even after we were told it would be no problem. The room never got cleaned the whole time we stayed, that was upsetting. . . The first Lanai Suite we had, the heater was broken on the Jacuzzi. Maintenance came up to fix it, and deemed it fixed when they left. It never got hot. The front desk manager came up and was kind enough to discount one night's rate and move us to a better room. That was fantastic service. . . All in all, I don't think I'll ever stay anywhere else while in Las Vegas. I can't wait until the summer comes back around and I can try out the pools.
I absolutely love this hotel. The room and view are spectacular!  We awe on the 55th floor looking south. Whoever designed this room is brilliant. I love the bed. Beyond comfortable. The pillows are perfect. From the fan in the bathroom to the reinforced windows. The room is so quiet. We can't even here planes take off despite overlooking the airport. Thank you Cosmopolitan for a class act!
The Cosmopolitan tries to eschew the traditional Vegas hotel/casino look in order to provide a more boutique vibe.  It may be great in terms of appearance and decor, but the gaming here is not quite that good.  There are a limited amount of slot machines and the payouts are really stingy.  It does not really cater to degenerate gamblers like myself.  It serves mostly people who come here for other reasons and then may spend some time on the machines.  Lack of attendants and infrequent cocktail waitress visits, make fora frustrating time on the floor.  There is also a lack of variety in the table games.  But it is fairly clean.
My first time in Vegas came here for nye 4 nights. Can say had an amazing time and great experience. Staff are friendly and helpful. The view we had was amazing! The shower and bathroom was great. . The only weird part I would stay would be the Window to the shower you can see from the beds. And the curtain is controlled by those on the outside of the shower. If you're a kinky couple that's fine by if you're that kinky you should be in the shower together.
Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #11 - #365. . Recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan, for a family vacay and I happen to have a excellent casino discount for December 27 - 29th, those dates were packed with Vegas tourists and hardcore clubbers. My parents weren't really impressed with the Cosmopolitan and said they have stayed at other 5 star hotels that were more impressive than the Cosmo, I disagree.. . The check in clerk tried to up-sell me a suite for $50 more per night, I kept declining since I was hardly in the room and was a waste of $50. Instead of staying in the, Studio Terrace Room like last time, we stayed in the City Room with 2 Queen Beds in the West Tower. The Room was clean and much better than our last room at, Caesars Palace, the part of the view was blocked off by the Polo Tower and had a small view of the Center Strip and the Polo Towers tennis court.. . I just loved the kind of clientele, the Cosmopolitan attracts; young, hip, and trendy. I haven't tried most of the restaurants while I was staying there, except for the Henry (Separate Review).  . . What I dislike about the Cosmopolitan:. . --Unorganized Check In/Out Lines. --Some of the table dealers were rude. --Young Drunks in the wee hours in the morning around the casino with no security controlling it. --Security guards by the elevators don't check guests for room keys. . What I like about the Cosmopolitan:. . +Chic decor around the casino and hotel rooms. +Hospitable hotel staff. +Location/ Footsteps away from the strip. +Terraces in some of the hotel rooms. +The Henry, Bond Bar, Chandelier Bar, Book and Stage. +The Boulevard Pool. . Would I stay here again? . . Hell Yeah!. . . **TIP   Please leave the kids at HOME!!
Sad to say I didn't have a very pleasant stay. Only giving it an extra star for the decor and good food options. The first room we got had a surprise. My bf noticed some crusty streaks on the window which turned out to be boogers. Gross!!! Then as he laid in bed he noticed a disturbing odor.  Turned out to be dried up VOMIT between the bed and night stand. WTF!!!!! We were given another room. Upon checkout my bf noticed a random charge. He called the guest services to find out what the charge was and was put on hold for about half an hour while the charge was being investigated. They couldn't verify where the charge was made and had to remove it. I'm not very happy with my experience here.
Worst value on the strip.  Stayed here for New Years.  Property is nice, but the service is not acceptable.  Our rooms weren't ready on time.  When they were our keys didn't work.  It was almost impossible to get a drink at the bar (it wasn't crowded).  Room service tray was so hot that I was burned.. . I've stayed in a lot of the hotels on the strip, and for the money this is the worst.
We stayed in the Terrace Suite with a Japanese-styled bathtub that overlooks outside the window. Need I say more? This place is awesome! My only gripe would be how unorganized the check-in line was, but overall the decor of this place is sleek and modern, exactly what I like! They offer you bottles of water as you wait in line and all staff are friendly. The room is very comfortable and and spacious which is nice if you'll be going with a non-gambler or non-drinker and will be spending some time in your room.. . One of my other favorite things here is the Secret Pizza!
C is for ... Chic and Contemporary. O is for ... Opulent Decadence. S is for ... Sexy and Sensual. M is for ... Marque Dayclub & Nightclub. O is for ... Optimal Location Mid-Strip. P is for ... Panoramic Views. O is for ... Outrageous & Over the Top. L is for ... Lovely and Lavish Rooms. I is for ... Irresistible Romance. T is for ... Tantalizing Bars & Restaurants. A is for ... Artsy and Hip. N is for ... Never-ending Naughtiness. . Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.. . Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).. . Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.. . Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).. . Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.. . Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.. . The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.
casino was great and the staff were polite. the parking garage was real easy to find a parking space in.
I have stayed here twice (complimentary) after getting on their radar with my casino play. I will say, even if the rooms weren't free - I would pay ANYTHING to stay in one of the Terrace Suites with a strip view, ANY DAY!!. . This casino/hotel has become my new "Vegas Home" and you would be stupid to not give this place a try!
I been there but its been a long time i never been back to the strip i miss the strip already.  I liked structure of the hotel and its modern style and its attracting to tourist people who don't leave in Vegas.
So, this review is for the horrible service I received trying to dispute a $420 overcharge today, and their technical problems that they should fix with all the money they make. Booked hotel online on cyber Monday, but their site was having a glitch, so I had to waste time to call the hotel, be on hold, let them find the problem, and confirm my reservations. Ok, fine, problem solved even though the lady said they charged me twice, but that she will fix it so that I will be charged only once.. . Fast forward, went to COSMO, room was ok although for that price, the shower shouldn't have nasty water and scum stains...had fun,but just checked my cc, and they charged me again for the same charge on my checkout date. Wtf?!! So, somehow I'm assuming my payment didn't show up prepaid?! Fine! So, to fix THEIR MISTAKE, I waste MY time calling them to get my money back, and get transferred twice, talked to lady about overcharge, then she said she'll look up my account, put me on hold while they look it up. As I'm on hold, I hear the music.. music.. then clicks like someone picked up (no music), then music, then click, then ringing, then all of a sudden, "you have reached the accounting department, and blah blah blah, CLOSE! Please leave a message.. Blah blah blah...' . . Ok... Thought they may have pressed the wrong button, so hung up and called them again, and got this RUDE A$$ LADY WITH MUCHO ATTITUDE. I'm trying to explain that there was a lady helping me and put me on hold, so please transfer me back. She starts going off telling me that it's an accounting problem, they're closed, nothing they can do, probably why the girl forwarded my call to voicemail, yadda yadda yadda. IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB, THEN DON'T WORK THERE SINCE IT SHOWS IN YOUR VOICE! . . 3.5 stars. -1 SCUM & WATER STAINS IN SHOWER. -1 RUDE LADY ON PHONE, NO HELP. -1 OVERCHARGING ME
Just got back from Las Vegas. Wooohooo! :D. . Cosmo is in its winter hibernation mode like a big Russian bear. Meaning everything is still the same except you can feel the overall relaxed atmosphere after the big holidays. . The only thing I want to suggest to cosmo is to pay a little more attention to details.. I know its hard when 80k people come and go over the weekend however I feel like the hotel itself looks and feels different summer time or maybe I was just too sober this time to notice the little details that were an eye sore. hehe . ^____^ Or the hotel is better staffed during summer time....IDK. . By details I mean cleanliness of the entrance door to the room and scuff marks all over the freaking place...you can feel that you are a number instead of feeling like a guest. I was a bit put off when I arrived and saw black finger print stains on the entrance door like CSI just finished up collecting evidence from the crime scene LOL. Does it really matter? No but that's what I mean by little details.... . Furthermore, I like seeing Police presence @ the hotel. It was good to see Sheriffs cruising around the Casino floor and by Marquee. Their presence alone does get rid of a lot of unnecessary drama.. . Lastly, I love this hotel and I will continue staying here and recommending it to everyone. Just please make sure you hustle cosmo. I hustle to have $$$ to spend at your establishment and you please do the same in return $__$. . Please tip well and you will get hooked up everywhere! :D. . Cheers!
Take a snapshot of where the fuck you parked because it could get mighty confusing. They have only one lobby on the west end, walked to death to check in cuz we parked in the east side apparently.. . Our suite was so sexy and with the perfect view of the area. Lots of privacy even on the balcony... Whoever designed this hotel was a fucking gay perfectionist... From the art to the layout... Nothing but perfection. Deadbolt your door because these maids check in at all hours during the day so if you're caught with pants down... hmm... Oh well. . . The bars here are fancy fab, love it, and they have Liberace's car on display.
This is mostly a well thought out hotel with top restaurants, a beautiful Chandelier bar, an ice rink in the winter and a warm gambling area.  The rooms are awesome although expensive because of quality and location.  The staff is great as well, very friendlyand helpful.  It can be difficult to get in and out of the garage when crowded and signage is not great.  Their is nothing cheap here although you often get value.  The gambling area is a little smaller and crowded than I would like but mostly Cosmo is out of this world!
Now that I've stayed here, I can comment about the accommodations.  . . I was in town for a concert, demand was slack, and I was able to get one of the corner suites for about $300 if I recall correctly.  It was a very sizable, well appointed suite with great views of the strip from inside and especially from the wrap around deck.  The price was right, and it was fun to try it out.  . . It's a nice property with lots of dining, shopping, and nightlife options  . . In my opinion, it does tend to draw a crowd that skews somewhat younger and rowdier, and, frankly, douchier, than properties like Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, etc.  Whether that's a pro or a con depends on you and what you're looking for.  . . Because of how the property is situated on the strip and because of the dining, shopping, and nightlife options, it tends to draw a lot of foot traffic from the strip and can get crowded at times . . In my opinion, also, it's probably not as posh of a property as plaices like Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, or Bellagio, for example.  Again, whether that's a pro or a con depends on you and what your'e looking for. . . I like the location of the Cosmopolitan.  It's relatively easy to get to from the airport or from the I-15 if you are driving, and its situated close to lots of other properties you might want to check out, such as the other City Center properties and Planet Hollywood, etc., across the street.
Cosmopolitan is the one of the nicest COOL hotel. The chandelier is beautiful that spreads throughout the 4 floors (3.5 floors). It's a must visit. We were there when the ice skating link was present with live DJ music where the pool is in wintertime. Cool stuff
REVIEW OF EVENT HELD AT COSMO NOT A REVIEW OF THE HOTEL. . . We attended your New Years Eve Skating rink only to be totally disappointed and when I contacted your events department via email I received no reply... please see my email below hopefully I can get some kind of reply now.... . Your event at the ice rink was EXTREMELY disappointing. For $160.00 a ticket I would have expected that your event be fully thought out ahead of time and set up flawlessly. We were expecting to see and hear the Bruno Mars concert. One it finally came on at 11pm (no one could give us a definite start time) it was only on the screen for not even 10 minutes before the audio feed went out and they were not able to get it back. We stood and waited hoping that the feed would come back but it never did someone finally decided it maybe a good idea to just put regular music back on so we weren't waiting in silence. . . This was a HUGE  disappointment considering this is LAS VEGAS and everyone is paying top dollar to have a fun safe New Years.
This was one of my favorite Marriotts!!! I was upgraded due to my elite status but of course it was not completely free, but we got in the room and was suprised by the view!! We had the bellagio water view and could just lay down on the bed and watch!  We had a shower that walked through to a roman style tub that could view the whole strip!! The only thing is that you will pay to stay here!! They charge 3 times the amount for snacks in the room and the food is over priced compared to other Marriotts (but to be expected).  The experience started with the valet, just to drive in and see "Cosmopolitian" in glass was breathtaking!  Then registration was easy and fast and suprised because this was during the busy season.  The pool area had a DJ playing and seemed to have all the younger crowd going, and walking around we were amazed by the chandelier bar, it was just BEAUTIFUL!  The room has exquisite decor, including the closet, bathroom, living room and bedroom, the TV controls everything, including the windows, lighting, and door lock!  This is your top of the line hotel with all the amenities I didn't even get to see all the resturaunts but this is a well maintained property!. . I would not suggest children to stay, it doesn't seem to not be a kid friendly place, but it is really focused on the younger 21 to 35 crowd and there are some items that younger minds might not be ready for...just be aware.
My dream hotel in Vegas was always the Cosmopolitan. I vowed to stay there one day but my frugal side always got the best of me and I would book another (fabulous) hotel that was less pricey. However, when my job gave me an opportunity to be put up in the Cosmopolitan for a client summit, I was so excited to see if the accommodations would live up to my expectations. Needless to say, they exceeded everything and anything I could have hope for!! . . I stayed in a suite with every luxury you could imagine...a fully stocked bar, beautiful  living room, full Japanese soaking bath tub, luxuriousbedding with flat screen TV, awesome toiletries (don't lie, you know you care about this!), a fabulous closet, and an amazing balcony overlooking parts of the strip. I almost wanted to ditch the conference and hibernate in my room for the entire trip! Unfortunately, I had to leave way too many times throughout my brief stay, BUT I made sure I used the tub and luxuriated in my suite enough to put a smile on my face every time I think of my experience. . . On a general note, this hotel has everything you could ever want. The decor is elegant and retro enough to make you feel truly glamorous. The staff is friendly and helpful. The casinos are wonderful, and the restaurants and shops will leave you with an array of options from casual to decadent. Btw none of their shops are the same cookie cutter ones you find in every other high end hotel in Vegas. They're actually more boutiques than large stores. There is even a new pop up wedding chapel for anyone who wants to make the most of their stay! I can't say enough about this hotel except that I will definitely be staying there again. Go! Enjoy!
This is a beautiful hotel, nice rooms, good services, except...the internet quality is horrific.  It's slower than phone modems.  I had to use my cell phone just to check in for my flight, it took so long to connect to Southwest.  They could provide decent service, but they probably want people to go to the casino instead of staying in their rooms.  Pretty much everyone I talked to complained about it, heard it being discussed in the elevator, etc.  . . Speaking of elevators...they weren't working right for two days and there didn't seem to be any effort to fix them.  The cards weren't being recognized (you can't go up to your room without the card insertion) and you could stand in a bank of elevators for ten minutes waiting.. . Other than that, loved it.  But those things brought it so far down, I doubt I would stay again.
Beautiful casino, especially their Chandelier bar as their centerpiece.  A must to grab a (questionably overpriced) drink.  Their signature nightclub Marquee is definitely worth a visit if you're comped or have the money to burn.  Plenty of spaces to explores and get lost in.
This review is based off of the hotel experience only.  My boyfriend and I are no strangers to Vegas.  We have stayed at many different hotels around the strip.  We checked into the Cosmopolitan today at 1:30 pm.  Valet is great because it is free, we always tip the bellhop and the valet driver.  The staff were very nice and made check in easy.  We were happy that there was a room available right away since we were early for check in.   We were given some misleading information when we made our reservation.  We were told it was a $150 deposit for the room for our entire stay and once we arrived it ended up being $150 PER NIGHT.  Of course it is refundable and I normally don't mind putting that hold on a credit card if I'm getting a nice experience in a fancy hotel, HOWEVER... We booked a 3 night stay in the Terrace One Bedroom Suite (normally $206/ nightly) which had a WONDERFUL view of the the Bellagio parking garage and air conditioners.  We were offered a fountain view for an extra $30 a night but we said the city view would be more our style since we enjoy the city lights more.  (I think it would have been more helpful if they have three selections for room views: FOUNTAIN, STRIP, and OBSTRUCTED CITY)  Then we might have paid the extra cash to at least not look at a parking garage.  . . The view wasn't even our biggest concern, what really made our excitement go down was how unclean the room was.  Just a couple of things to point out were:. . The trash was not emptied from the previous occupants. The linens were stained with makeup from a drunken pass out of previous occupants. The furniture was stained, chipped, and not wiped down.. Scratches ALL OVER every wall.. Glass shower window had spots all over it. Soaking tub had beverage rings all around the sides. The bed they say is a KING feels more like a FULL.. They provide you a microwave and dishwasher but NO dishes. . That's just a few things... (Photos to be uploaded soon). . I have to be fair and give a few things that we did like:. The decor is stylish . The soaking tub is large and has a sexy view to the bedroom and a window.. There is lots of storage for your things. The desk is helpful. Casino/Restaurants/Shopping are great to explore. Hotel is located right at the heart of the action of the strip. . . What really makes me sad is that I REALLY, REALLY, wanted to love this hotel.  It has been a dream to stay here and now that I am I would much rather return to my old favorite which is The Signature at MGM Grand. You can get a larger ONE BEDROOM SUITE with a completely separate living room, full kitchen, two bathrooms, and more for only $150/ nightly versus the $206/ nightly here and I can assure you that every time you step into a room there it will feel brand new as if you are the first person to ever stay there.  For the Cosmopolitan I cannot say the same.  . . I'm sorry Cosmo but when we check out, we will NOT be returning.  Clean up your hotel or lower your prices because this place is highway robbery.
When it comes to Vegas I'm all about Location. Cabs are really expensive here so the more I can walk to places the happier I am. When it comes to location The Cosmoploitan can't be beat. It is located right in the middle of everything. THe hotel is also very Posh and have a sophisticated feel about it. The casino is large but only one of many things to do while staying here. The mall is small but has some fun stores to look around. One of my favorite things about staying here was all the different places to eat. There are lots of different places to try. One complaint I have is the tables here have high minimum bets even when the place is dead. I found myself walking over to Planet Hollywood to do my gambling because of this. Over all a fun place to stay right in the middle of all the action!!
Absolutely elegant and classy! . No casino like it on the strip!. It's different but in a good way.. A definite must see if you come to Vegas. . They have concert venues and the best club in town Marquee. And some of the best restaurants as well. You have to have their secret pizza :) it's located inside of cosmopolitan but sshh... It's secret so good luck finding it. But when you do gosh will you be happy. :))) cosmopolitan is the place to be on the strip.
I absolutely love this hotel. I stayed here for a few nights and I absolutely loved every second of it. Honestly, I think I will be staying here every time I go to Vegas from here on out. That's how much I enjoyed the Cosmo. The rooms are amazing and spacious, they almost all have amazing views and its a really big grandiose hotel.. . I'm glad that they've toned down the glittery aspects of the hotel from what it used to be when  it opened, which was gaudy and painful to the eyes. Now its just classy and full of amazing bars, restaurants and people. I really enjoy walking through this hotel and just getting drinks with friends at the Chandelier (a gigantic 3 storey bar under a chandelier).. . The parking situation could be better, but I do appreciate the parking sensors that tell you which spots are occupied and which spots are open. I also don't like that you have to take an elevator from the parking garage to the main lobby level and then take the elevators from the lobby level to the rooms. ALSO they really need to fix the card readers in the elevators because they don't work. Please adopt NFC for your keycards or something because the card readers in the elevators are embarassingly broken.
When this hotel opened, it was the talk of the Las Vegas Strip, but when I went this last time around, it seems that this hotel has taken a turn for the worst. Went there on a friday night to hit up the bars/clubs at this hotel, and it was a dead scene. I thought it could be a dead week to be in Vegas, but it really wasn't. I went to check out the roulette table, and found that the tables were ridiculously priced, and a lot of people not playing. I think they have set the standard a bit too high, and from what I saw the demand wasn't there. The crowds were plenty at the MGM and at Wynn and Encore. The hotel is gorgeous, but it seems that Marque might be the only thing that is really attracting any crowd to that hotel.
This is an update to my previous review of the hotel portion of the Cosmopolitan.  The morning after my review, we received a phone call expressing their concern about the view and cleanliness of our room.  They offered to change our rooms free of charge.  They moved us to a fountain view room on a higher floor and they also moved us from the one bedroom terrace to the terrace suite which is much larger and has more amenities such as a dining room, full kitchen, two bathrooms, washer and dryer, and a larger bedroom.. . The room itself was MUCH cleaner and more well maintained than our previous room which made us feel better about our stay.  The only issue we found was that my boyfriend got stuck in the bedroom because they have sliding doors to separate the bedroom from the living room and it was partially detached and got wedged together with the other door.  Eventually we got him out though without any assistance.. . The kitchen has an oven, a stove, a dishwasher and a fridge and freezer but no utensils, no plates, no bowls, no soap, and no purpose.  Do they expect travelers to bring their own plates and forks?  I just didn't see the point.  For looks?. . The rooms are not all the same, they advertise having a touch tablet phone in the room (we had two rooms and both did not have them)  We also did not have the iPod adapter as advertised either.  . . We had to call for a do not disturb sign since our room did not have one and not to mention they have like seven different do not disturb signs which isn't very classy in my opinion.  The rooms are supposed to feel very unison. . . Housekeeping still needs to be better trained, they do not clean well.  There was some cereal spilt on the floor (a couple flakes)  when we first arrived and instead of it getting swept up it was swept into a pile on the floor for us to clean up.  Why do I have to clean up someone else's mess?  . . The air conditioner is motion censored, so you can't cool your room off while you are out and it can only be dropped to 65 degrees.  It was kind of frustrating to not be able to come back to a nice cool room.. . You are supposed to be able to control a lot of things from your TV but our remote batteries were dead so no TV for us.. . All in all everything and everyone just seems to be on different pages.  There is no communication in this company.  I understand it is a huge hotel but come on I work at a company that has well over 22,000 employees and we are all one same page.,. . The only other big issue we had with our new room was after returning from a fun day of activities our guest bathroom had a very strong scent of marijuana.  We were not sure why it smelled that way seeing as how we had been gone all day.  We assumed it was either house keeping being naughty or the party goers staying in the room next to ours and the scent somehow seeped in.  We called the front desk about it three times.  The first time they said they would be sending the floor manager up.  After 30 minutes there was still no knock on the door.  We were hungry and wanted to go grab food so we called once more.  They said this time they would send up housekeeping to come clean the bathroom and we didn't need to be present.  So we went and grabbed dinner.  Upon returning the restroom appeared the same. Same smell and still just as strong.  We attempted to call once more.  This time they said there wasn't much they could do except bring a machine up to suck up the scent.  So to us it felt like a big "What do you want me to do about it?" and "Deal with it"  We let it go, just closed up that bathroom the best we could to keep it from seeping into the rest of the room.. . Luckily when we arrived for our check in date there was a room already ready,  crappy... but ready.  Every evening after that though we saw about 30-40 people camped out in the lobby waiting for a room well past 5 pm (check in is at 3pm mind you)  It just doesn't seem acceptable to not have rooms ready by the check in time.. . Overall the upgrade was really nice of them and we really appreciate it because it made our trip not as stressful and it was also a little more comfortable.  A big shout out to Joe and Nathan our bellhops who are very friendly and professional and deserve a bonus because they are so awesome.. . I said it last time,  I REALLY wanted to love this hotel.  I really did.  I just can't.  Not until they retrain their staff, maintenance their rooms, and become more organized.. . If you are planning to stay at this hotel it is a nice hotel with a comfortable living space, great location, and great amenities, I just think there are other hotels with a luxurious quality that have a better value, better staff, and better organization.
We visited our friend who was staying in a huge terrace suite with a wrap around balcony and the panoramic view is absolutely SPECTACULAR!  The suite has beautiful modern decor and includes a large bedroom with adjoining spacious bath, living room, powder room, dining area and full kitchen in 1200 sq ft.  I would definitely want to stay at the Cosmopolitan next time I visit Las Vegas!
So disappointed in the service in the casino and the bars. I hung out here for three nights and had great time gambling and listening tithe DJ music. However, the service in the bars and in the casinos just sucks. Very rude and inattentive cocktail waitresses. Tried to speak with a manager who first was unavailable then he did talk with me but did not care about my complaint. Not worth my time and money for the worst customer service on the strip
After having gone to Vegas a few years now for NYE, I have sampled most of the casinos for atmosphere, design, and atmosphere.   This place wins by a mile.   The bars and restaurants and shops are all high class and there is a very organic, original design principle that lets the ideas from one structure flow to the next.  No other casino is so well designed in every square inch.   The center chandelier bar is a fantastic centerpiece.  The views from Comme Ca (and the food) are amazing.  I have yet to explore all the nightclubs and restaurants but will be back to do so.. . I have to state that I have not actually stayed here, it is way above my price range, at least for the holidays, but if I ever made more money I would and it would be fantastic I'm sure.
Came here to see Kaskasde at Marquee and I was blown away at how beautiful this place was. It was clean and gorgeous. The people were fine, the company was fine, I was literally in another world. The glistening jewels of the ceiling decorations came down in pretty droplets as if it was raining crystals, there were translucent drapes lit up by pink and purple dancing across the top. It's safe to say the the decor was impeccable. The people working the front of Marquee at Cosmo was very professional and courteous, since we were on the VIP list we got to the club in matter of minutes instead of waiting in line. So kudos to the employees there!. . There's this red stiletto shoe on the first floor that everyone likes to take pictures with and the line to take a photo can get long at least when I was visiting.. . I've also wandered the halls of Cosmo and they have a really cool interactiveart gallery on one of their floors along with other swanky restaurants that I haven't tried, but the art gallery is definitely a place to take a look at. I also love the fact that they have a lot of chairs for people who are either tired walking around or just want a place to sit and relax and best of all the chairs were very comfortable! Cosmo is definitely hands down one of my favorite hotels in Vegas! :)
New trendy hotel, good parking garage design and hotel design, easy to navigate and strong drinks at the bars. The minimums at the tables are a little high, but in line with the rest of the newer casinos on the strip. I would consider this one of the upper level casinos in Vegas
The ambiance here is amazing from diamond chandeliers at every inch of the ceiling, the beautiful decorations to all the pretty people walking around but thats about it. The staff wasn't very pleasant, it was crowded, the gambling was horrible for everyone in my group. . I dont think I will be going back here. . I was very disappointed. I was expecting a whole lot more excitement when I was there.
I love love love this hotel! My experience from check in to check out was the best! All staff were friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful with an awesome view of the strip. Every part of the hotel is modern with such amazing detail. I didn't have a chance to utilize the pool but did get to hang out there and enjoy my coffee one morning. The only minor negative for me was the view from the fitness center. It has a view of the strip but it's blocked by some big unit (maybe air conditioner). But the fitness center has everything you need so it's really nothing to complain about. . . I love how the Cosmo is centrally located on the strip! You step out and you are in the heart of it all. . . I hope to return soon and stay here again!!
I stayed there about a week ago for 3 nights and Im simply in love with it. From the moment you walked in, you have the giant screens on pillars displaying art to the elegant casino, it's simply an intimate hotel. We arrived around 10am, bellhop was able to hold onto our bags and they said they would send us a text for our room But around 1, I was really tired and asked if our room was ready. They gave us our key cards promptly, didnt know how to use the elevator but one of the staff members was really helpful. The elevators move incredibly fast, we made it to the 51st floor in about 15 seconds. When we booked online I asked for a terrace studio but when we entered our room I was surprised to see they automatically upgraded us to a 1 bedroom terrace view of city center in the east tower for free! I loved the japanese soaking tub, the ultra comfy robes, even the greeting the t.v. displays when you turn it on. :) When we first arrived the tub's plug was broken, called concierge and within 20 mins maintenance arrived and fixed it immediately. Beds are super comfy, love that the pillows easily conform to the body and love having a drink with my love enjoying the nightime view on the terrace.I like that the casino is small, its more inviting and the cocktail waitresses are friendly. The chandelier bar is gorgeous and love the video decor. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Upon checkout through the t.v. I noticed extra charges on my account, I went to the lobby downstairs and they removed it immediately. If you are planning a vacation I highly reccomend this place, I'm not what you would call their regular wealthy clientele but I saved money for a couple of months for a romantic place to stay and they exceeded expectations. And getting into marquee free isn't bad either. ;)
Definitely one of my top hotels in Las Vegas, right on par if not better than Encore. Have not had the luxury to stay here but I love coming to this hotel on each visit. The chandeliers, the decor, the ambience and overall incredible classy feel of the hotel is just so enticing. It has such a new and beautiful feeling and you can tell that the they did not hold anything back when designing this hotel.
Wraparound Suite is amazing! It has a kitchen, fridge and stove.The bed is very comfy to just chill and sleep in after you party like a rockstar.
Yep.  The Cosmo is heaven.  Period.. . I can't tell you how much I love this hotel.  I used to be a loyal Wynn/Encore girl all the way, but I'm afraid The Cosmo has stolen my heart.. . Every detail about this hotel is fabulous.  The layout makes it surprisingly easy to navigate, especially when you're staying there as a guest.  I'm pretty sure this is one of the only big hotels on the strip where you don't have to walk through the entire casino to reach the guest elevators - so refreshing!. . The rooms here are very...cosmopolitan!  Yes it is one of the priciest places to stay, but if you want the Vegas experience, and maybe you're looking for something trendier, and more sexy, this is your spot!  Even the most basic room will not disappoint.. . The casino and casino bars are super swanky, which I love.  All the decor is done to the nines, with really cool LED light fixtures and other intriguing designs to make you feel extra fancy wherever you are. My favorite spot is definitely The Chandelier - see review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-chandelier-las-vegas#hrid:wswf9u0Aa1y02z_FqQTs9A. . Also, don't forget to make a stop at Holstein's! http://www.yelp.com/biz/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas#hrid:8UWwAnQ9l4_URQ31Hw0u1w. . I could go on for days about all the great things The Cosmo has to offer, but just take my word for it and go there - you'll be glad you did!
My GF and I received a packet of free discounts and goodies to the Cosmo on our United Flight coming into Vegas, so we spent a good chunk of time there.  Although a good portion of it was all a little out of our price range, what we did was awesome.  From the wonderful restaurants(WICKED SPOON!!) to the 'happening' Marquee the Cosmo is wonderful.  A beautiful hotel throughout it exudes a hip confidence about itself that sets it apart from the other Strip Hotels/Casinos.
Not cheap, but the rooms, fitness center, and staff are great! You are also within easy walking distance to The Aria, Caesar's, and Bellagio.
Very nice hotel and good service . Lobby is clean and upscale, the only problem is parking is hard to find so we had to valet the car and it took 45-1 hour to get our car . . I dont really understand the design of the bathroom, there is a see through glass with shutter over the shower on the bedroom side and a big opening at the tub also accessible from the bedroom, so anyone in the room can see you in the bathroom.  The distance between the shower and the tub is like 4-5 steps and there is nothing between shower and mirror/sink so got all my toiletry wet while taking a shower, the whole design of it its very odd to me.
Beautiful hotel, beautiful suites. We had a view over the Bellagio's fountains and got to watch the light shows all evening! It was beautiful. The rooms were clean and spacious, the upgrade to the suite was so decadent! It had so much space and little luxurious nuances. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The only goofy thing was the hotel decorations: its decorated for women who read cosmopolitan magazine. It has enormous High heeled shoes decorating the lobby and everything is hot pink and black...I liked it, but I'm quite girl...My beau remarked how the whole hotel looks like it is for a bachelorette party. Cold casino as well....
This is one of my fave places to stay when I'm in Vegas. Great location, right in the heart of the strip. The decor, service, nightclub/dayclub, rooms (balconies with an amazing view!) and food are top-notch! Their nachos and cheesecake are the best I've ever had!!! Be sure to sign up for their Identity Rewards program (it's free!)...you earn points for every dollar spent in the hotel. Ladies (and guys, too) don't forget your photo-op in the red shoe :) This place is pricey, but it's worth it!
Great spot on the Vegas strip.  Rooms are very well appointed with full living room and kitchen for entertaining.  Nice pools with a more low key relaxed vibe.  If you plan your trips around nightlife it was a huge bonus to save the $40 cover per person by showing the staff your room key for complimentary cover.
I stay in Vegas 7-8 times a year and have experienced every major hotel on the strip. Cosmo is a great place the rooms are the best I have seen in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed having a couch to relax on when I wasn't working. I had room service several times while I stayed there and every time the food was excellent and the service was fast. I'd stay here anytime!
While checking in, their impressive lobby keeps you distracted from the short line. A guy named Joey working the counter, thankfully talked me into upgrading into a "wraparound suite". Our room was absolutely incredible, and is likely what everyones cliche Vegas fantasy must look like. A friend of mine booked their standard room next to ours, and even that room was awesome! You won't be disappointed staying here. The staff was very friendly all around, fun & down to earth. The ambience was modern and trendy in a good way. Grab a Cosmo at their gorgeous chandelier bar, and book a table at Marquee if you can afford it! Between the restaurants & everything else, there isn't a whole lot of motivation to go anywhere else LOL, Cheers!
Great location in the middle of the strip. Love the fountain view room; the room is very spacious and doesn't feel like a hotel room really much at all. . I've stayed here twice: June and January. On our most recent visit, we had a couple of issues with the cleaning staff with our room: there were gloves left on our balcony and then some other supplies left the next day in the bathroom, including a rag in the tub. We addressed this with the front desk and they comped the upgrade fee ($40) for one night. . If you are going with friends, be sure to try to get into the same tower (east may be best in summer/pool season as you bypass the pool elevator traffic). You also may consider the block of floors as there are 3 elevators then in each tower depending on the floor you are staying  on. Just something to consider.. The hotel is nice and posh; it doesn't have an overwhelming theme like others do, but if the theme is anything, maybe it is chandeliers and shoes!. The casinos are nice. They have a variety of options so you can go from high roller to a $5 table to the slots. . There are lots of places to go, including the Chandelier Bar, Secret Pizza, Wicked Spoon buffet, Marquee club, and more!
perfection from head to toe!. . staff:  exceptional service - going above and beyond expectations.  the staff remembered my name and personally welcomed me upon every arrival and asked if i needed any assistance with directions or recommendations upon my departures.  . . service:  prompt, courteous, professional, personal. . accommodations:  clean, contemporary, classy, refined, fresh. . view:  my suite was on the 58th floor and overlooked the fountains.  i couldn't imagine a better view in the whole city!. . shopping:  shopping!  shopping!  shopping!. . food:  three words "o" "m" "g" - Jose Andres, Holsteins, The Wicked Spoon... beyond my culinary expectations!  . . club:  Marquee was off the chain!. . parking:  not only did they provide valet service, but they were able to accommodate my Tesla and allowed for charging.  VIP valet service!. . overall, if i could live here, i would!   i don't write many reviews, but, when i do, i mean what i say.   i was sincerely impressed with the property and service.  i'm not big into gaming - so, i haven't much a comment where that is concerned - but, the lobby and the tables were full and festive.  . . literally my  best experience with any hotel property in Las Vegas and one that tops the list for my experiences with places around the world.
Stayed here for my bachelorette party. Very modern and very clean rooms. Also a perfect location on the strip. Honestly, we only left this place a couple times. Once to go to a different pool party (wet republic). But you really don't have to leave this hotel once you're there. Their pool party (marquee) was the highlight of my trip (A better scene than wet republic too). We were partying in one of those private cabanas with the infinity pools. The guys & girls bringing the booze to us were great- always making sure we were having a great time and very professional. There are TONS of restaurants right in the hotel too. Both expensive and extremely casual. And their nightclub, marquee, was also a great time. Absolutely loved the bars too- the one near the check-in and the chandelier one esp!! . Next time I plan a trip to Vegas I'm def staying here again. Thanks Cosmo for an unforgettable bachelorette party!
I am review 2000 !!!!!! . . This place is amazing. Clean hotel with amazing service and balconys in every room. . . The bathrooms are great with a jacuzzi and all. Rooms all come with amazing views and room service as well as the best day clubs in Vegas..  . Wicked spoon the buffet is probably the best buffet I've had. Ever. . . The bachanical at Cesar's is amazing as we'll. . . Love Vegas. Love the Cosmo. Will be back.
I love this hotel!  This was my second stay and I was eager to get back.  Second sales conference I attended here.  My room was a suite.  A luxurious living area with mini bar, yummy snacks (way too expensive but comforting to know, if I got hungry in the middle of the night,, I could fulfill a craving!)  A generous dressing area and a king sized bed with the fluffiest of pillows and down cover.  My favorite part of the room however, is the soaking tub in the bathroom.  Decorated with marble and a complete liability, the soaking tub is fueled with the hottest of water to cover the achiest parts of your body afterwalking all over Vegas during the day or sitting more than 12 hours in seminars!  Gosh,  what a way to fall into the deepest sleep you'll experience in life.  My husband joined toward the end of my conference.  His reaction to the room was "oh my gosh, you should see this room."  It felt good that after the many wonderful things I have experienced because of him, he could enjoy opportunities which came my way.  It's an expensive hotel and it caters to adults and business.  Not for kids....which makes it super great!  Oh I forgot to mention that there was a balcony too with a beautiful view in any direction.
