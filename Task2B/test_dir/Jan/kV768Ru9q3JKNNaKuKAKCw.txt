I have seen many of the shows by Cirque du Soleil in Vegas. This one is by far the best. It is also I think the oldest.. . The only critique I really have about this show is that in the over 10 years that hit has been running... They have not updated it at all.. . I went to see it again just last week and it was as good as I remembered... But exactly as I remembered. The concept is awesome and they should update the show keeping the water thing but adding new modern elements to it.
I was awed from the moment I first stepped inside the O theatre at the Bellagio. The theatre resembled a European opera house, so large and beautiful. As amazed and enthralled as I was throughout the entire water-themed production, I had found myself even more dumbfounded (in a good way) when I was walking back to my hotel room and realized that no, stupid me, the performers couldn't have had access to LAND inside the pool below the stage. Meaning that after they took a plunge inside the pool they must have breathed through a regulator as they stayed invisible from the surface. You see, I'm not very smart. I thought that all the crazy trapeze acts, adagio and acrobats, all the floating, russian-swinging, high-diving madness was, well, mad enough. Perhaps I just didn't have it in me to fit SCUBA complexity into my perspective of this magical show..now that just brings the entire production to a whole other dimension. On one side I am pretty disappointed that I didn't get to appreciate the circus the way it deserved to be appreciated. Although I LOVED it, it would have been even more mindblowing to enjoy all the acts I could see on the surface and being able to understand the stuff below it. Everything synchronized to perfection, moving like clockwork. To keep in mind that there's a shitload of things going on underwater and the SCUBA divers who made one appearance throughout the end of the show were probably the ones assisting the performers who needed air to breathe underwater as some of them must have stayed under more than a few minutes at a time. On the other hand, I am pretty stoked that I can see the show for the second time and be even more in awe. The performers, the set, the theatre, the music, the water, the acts...everything beautiful.
It should have been great coz my husband was awake the entire show for the first time.
Words cannot express how dull and arrogantly incoherent this show is.  Not only did my wife fall asleep twice,  but so did the couple down the row from us.  Smiles were strikingly absent on the part of those leaving the theatre.  In short, it's not the worst thing I have ever seen, but of all thethings I have paid money to see live, it is by far the worst thing ever. Save your money.  Save your time.  Save your sanity. Avoid this.
This is an absolutely beautiful show to see while in Vegas and has you leaving feeling like an inadequate human being who needs to stretch more. In a good way.. . The combination of Cirque du Soleil amazingness with water is a winner.
Come to think of It, this is a pretty amazing show located inside the Bellagio.. . Performance: I thought fire dancing and aerial acrobatics were incredible and visually stunning. In between various performances, there were several comic relief scenes with the clowns as well as multiple diving performances. I didn't enjoy synchronized swimming that much, but I still appreciate how long it took them to practice and get the timing right.  . . Ticket might be a bit expensive comparing with other shows ($119.35 for limited view ticket - one of the highest seating level), but it definitely worth every penny. Expect approximately 25% diving / synchronized swimming, 25% aerial acrobatics, 25% fire dancing / comic relief scenes, and 25% miscellaneous acts (e.g. contortionists). . . I just like shows (like this one) that involve group efforts and the "OMG" moments. Simply a beautiful show.
Another fabulous Cirque Show!  O was incredibly visually stimulating.  Unlike Zumanity, the theater is huge...so having a balcony seat may not be the best way to go...tickets are expensive (in comparison to the other Cirque shows) but O is definitely the best Cirque show I have seen.  It's absolutely stunning...you can't look away!
Although I stand by my initial review, conversations with friends had v given some perspective.  It appears I had two fatal flaws... 1) having seen many diving acrobatics shows (which takes away some of the awe factor) and 2) sitting in the mezzanine.  For the latter,  visual effects are greatly diminished, as the "magic" is on full display. As such, if you still attend the show, you would be well advised to purchase tickets on the main floor.
I almost cried when I shelled out for tickets for Julia D and myself to see O at the Bellagio over Christmas but $260 for two upper tier seats turned out to be money well spent and one of the highlights of the trip to Vegas. . . The theatre is pretty good and even though our tickets said they were restricted views it didn't really spoil my enjoyment of the show. O is a water based show with the stage constantly evolving and adapting with the protagonists swimming, diving or appearing to walk on water at various times. O was my first Cirque du Soleil experience and I was very impressed with the whole set up. In Las Vegas there are so many shows to see but if you are willing to part with the cash I would recommend seeing this one.
I wish that I could give this show a higher rating but after sitting in the upper mezzanine all I could see for about 30% of the show was the big bright backlighting that made it hard to see the act. I was thoroughly disappointed by that. It seemed to me that it was unnecessary to have that light on at all! . . Over all it was a pretty great show and I did enjoy the clowns a lot. But for FUCKSAKE TURN OFF THAT BRIGHT ASS LIGHT! . . If you're going to see this show spend the extra money to get the closer seats off of the mezzanine. . . k thx bye.
Well.. when I say I adore Cirque; I imagine it makes me a tad bit biased.  But I always find them incredibly  beautiful, amazing and colorful!!!!  All the things which are the foundation to a great anything in life I imagine.  I just saw Totem not too long ago in San Pedro, CA so I obviously enjoy their shows a great deal.  But this is not so say that I go often as the prices are a bit expensive - but I do think they could stand to lower their prices in general.  Beyond that this show was transfixing and I thoroughly enjoyed the water element and all the fabulous special effects, acrobatics and diving that went along with that.
