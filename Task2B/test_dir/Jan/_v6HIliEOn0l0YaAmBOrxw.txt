I was in Vegas for a family vacation, and we needed to stay somewhere affordable because we had a large party booking several rooms. We got a good deal at Treasure Island but I wasn't sure what to expect. . . I was very happy with the hotel. The rooms are modern, clean, comfortable, and spacious. There was a mini fridge, which was great for bottled water and snacks. I had limited dealings with hotel staff but they were always pleasant and polite. The gym isn't huge but I never had to wait for a machine. Honestly I have no complaints.. . The casino floor was definitely not as fancy as some of the other hotels: for example, I previously stayed at The Venetian and there's a definite difference in the gaming portions of the hotels. Also, the food options are not great within the hotel itself. But I didn't spend much time in the casino, and there are tons of great food options just steps away (including a Starbucks just around the corner), so that wasn't a big deal. Excellent location on the strip, I would definitely stay here again.
Stayed here this past weekend for 5 days/4 nights .. . FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax . . Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!). . Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.. . Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very " I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.. . Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. . . Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?. . Room was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.. Halls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.. . The entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)
I am writing this review as I continue my stay at Treasure Island. I am here in Vegas for CES and so far Treasure Island is not making it easy for me to come back for an additional stay.. . When I reserved my room months ago, I specified that I require a non-smoking room due to my asthma - staying in smoking rooms makes my asthma act up and then I can't breathe. When I checked in, there were no non- smoking rooms available. Ok, that's fine. The front desk then found me a room that is smoking "optional" whatever that means.. . When I entered my room, I was appalled. The rooms tables, surfaces, dresser and even the sheets has significant dust in them. It was clear the room had not been used or cleaned in a very long time. Running your finger along the surfaces resulted in a dark black layer of dust, so I was very disappointed. When I contacted the frith desk I was told I could not change rooms due to CES. . . When I requested housekeeping to come clean the room it took an hour and a trip in person to the front desk. . . The housekeeping team showed up and did a full clean, but it was pretty annoying and gross to show up in a room so filthy.
We stayed at TI for 5 nights. No problem. Good place if you don't care about the fancy rooms and just have a hotel to sleep. They are into saving water and towel and reusing bed sheets unless asked to, so I thought that was good.
So I typically love TI because of Gilley's and Senor Frogs. My girlfriend and I always stay here for our annual trip but during our trip December 9th through the 12th we had a horrible experience! We check in and go to our room to rest a bit and my friend notices a weird patten on the tile floor in the bathroom. She thought it was blood spatter I thought it was the tile pattern...I was wrong. There were dried blood stains all over the bathroom floor and in the grout that came up with just water and a wash cloth meaning no one cleaned that bathroom since whatever occurred. It was the most disgusting unsanitary thing I have ever experienced; I mean you pay a $25 "resort fee" each day and it felt like a motel. When we informed management they asked us if we wanted someone to come up to clean the bathroom...we were shocked! This wasnt just a little blood it definitely fell into the amount of a safety/special clean up. Cleanliness is important and the management's lack of concern is a concern.
I suppose I'm taking out my disdain on Las Vegas itself - it is certainly not for me.  Depressingly trashy and full of boring chain restaurants, I don't understand why anyone would waste vacation time here.  We were on our way to Zion and Bryce Canyon and had to fly into the hell-hole known as Las Vegas.  We initially booked two nights because we'd never been, and we were both ready to leave by the morning.  Thank God that Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam were nearby.. . That being said, Treasure Island the hotel itself was nice and cheap.  They probably hate people like me, who get a $40 room and are expected to make up the difference by gambling hundreds of dollars.  No thanks.  They do up-charge for WIFI, etc.  The rooms were upscale and beds were luxuriously comfortable.  The hotel has everything that you could expect at a hotel in Vegas- robots sitting at slot machines with a lit cigarette, a cheap drink, and permanent frowns plastered on their face.  It also had cheesy places like "Kahunaville" and "Senor Frogs" in the bottom of the hotel.  Having heard glorious things about buffets in Vegas, we had to check out the one at Treasure Island.  Think: cafeteria/jail food quality.  . . The Treasure Island Pirate ("strip") show is definitely for adults only- not sure why people had their 12 year kids there.  Definitely plenty of immature innuendos going on, while prepubescent boys drooled with desire and dads guffawed at the scantily clad pirate strippers.  . . Won't ever go back to Vegas, so won't have the pleasure of staying here again.  And if I somehow do find myself here, I hope there's a loaded gun available.
Beware. Dirty casino. They fired all the dancers of the Sirens show 2 weeks before Christmas. They shut down 2 of 3 lanes in front of the pirate ships so they can add a CVS instead???  And it blocks traffic during the busiest week of the year!  The staff is very unhappy. Tom the doorman yells at all the taxi drivers on our way out. No wonder the taxis don't come back to pick up the huge line waiting for cabs. He told the taxi driver for the passenger in front of me to take the long way to the airport because he didn't get a tip for opening the door!  (Taxi driver loaded the luggage...). I heard Tom tell someone if they didn't like it they can take their business to Mirage next door. (Good idea).  Not much of a treasure for the T of TI.
Horrid customer service. Lack of security at elevators and no cameras in hallways makes for burglar paradise.. . We stayed at TI on December 25, 26, 27 with our extended family. On Christmas night, our locked rooms were pried and broken into and $8,000 worth of cash and merchandise was stolen. We have been calling risk management for the past two weeks but they have not been picking up, giving us the run around. I can't believe this is the way we are being treated as loyal customers of over 20 years. We want this resolved as soon as possible.. . Also talked to security and found out there are NO cameras in hotel room hallways due to privacy reasons. So what if something more horrid than a burglary happens there? Tough luck.
Of the three hotels my friends and I were deciding on I'm really glad we chose this one. Our room was really nice and clean and we had a great view. The pool area was a little small but it was really nice and not too crowded. The location is awesome too, it's right across the street from the Wynn and smack dab in the middle of the strip.. . Everyone kept telling me how smoky all the casinos were going to be but I didn't see anyone smoking inside until the last day we were there so that was a good surprise. The service was super slow when we were playing the slots though, it was almost impossible to find someone to get us drinks.. . I really liked this hotel and it was great for a first trip to Vegas. When I go again I definitely want to do it a little bigger and better and go to a more upscale hotel with a nicer pool area, but this hotel is great!
THE HOTEL ROOM. . I thought the rooms were very nice and clean. I don't understand the negative reviews, it's not The Cosmopolitan or The Bellagio so don't expect 5 star rooms when you're paying less than half the price.. . The rooms aren't huge but they're newly renovated and nicely appointed. The bath tubs are larger than most standard rooms which was a big plus. The beds are quite comfortable also. Location is great, right across from the mall and the Wynn hotel, walking distance to everything and a tram ride to the Mirage.. . Yes there's a $28 per night resort fee that's required upon check in but that's also stated when you're booking the hotel, so why the hell are people surprised? Every hotel charges a resort fee in Las Vegas similar to TI.
I come here a lot with my partner.  I have always enjoyed my stay here.  Very clean rooms,  never had a problem.  Staff is courteous and friendly.  I will say our rooms are always comped so I'm not sure if it's pricey to stay here. . . There is lots to do downstairs.  The casino seems good,  we've played blackjack and some slots here several times....always won a little bit of money. They do have this grouping of tables where all the dealers are dressed like hoochies wearing nothing but panties and bras.  Not my kind of thing to play cards with a half naked chic who doesn't seem to be enjoying herself that much...but I guess some guys are in to that. I could live without those tables..but it's Vegas. .  . The hotel is in a good location,  close to other big name hotels so if you get bored downstairs you can take a long walk to another hotel with the same kind of stuff...lol. . . All in all...we always enjoyed our stay and will be back.
I love this place , very clean , rooms are big and clean , customer service very professional , outside they have limo rides andthey will take you to anywhere you need to go , give them a smile and they won't charge you !. I definitely stay here next time !
Stayed her on MLK. . . Honestly, not a great hotel, but hey, a bed is a bed. . . Two queen size accommodating more than 7 people is definitely a dog fight. . . Pros:. Cheap rooms. . Cons:. Have to walk on the strip for food. lobby food way too expensive . Not really close to any popular clubs
I've stayed here twice...well, maybe 3 times? I can't remember exactly, but what I do remember is this is the place to stay if you're not looking to spend too much or too little money. It's nice enough where it's worth paying the 60 extra bucks a night vs staying somewhere like the Riviera or the Luxor (lame excuses for vegas hotel rooms). It's in a very good location, they show Mystere Cirque Du Soleil here which is probably the best Cirque show in Las Vegas (second would be Zumanity) and the rooms are a good size! You don't feel like youre sitting on top of each other, or like you're living out of your suitcase. I love this place, I only have had good experiences here. You also get priority viewing to the Sirens of T.I show if you're staying at this hotel, although granted, the show is pretty cheesy, but it's nice not to have to look over a hundred heads to get a good view.
I come to Vegas a lot for work but I've never stayed at TI and ive heard ok things. Will NEVER be back and its only night one for me. Stains all over the furniture in my room, (nasty stains on couch, won't be sitting down), the window wont close all the way so it sounds like a wind tunnel in my room. their remedy is to duct tape it. Really?? What if i wanted to actually use the window, do I have to keep reordering duct tape from downstairs? Called front desk to see if i can switch rooms, negative. Wouldn't give me time of day. Will never be back. Shocked to see such poor hospitality. Just awful
