Thursday night dinner: $34.99. If you want lobster, $10 more. If you want bottomless alcohol, $12.99 more. Arriving at 7pm, wait in line for at least an hour. Sighs~. . Food quality is average. Choices are okay. Didn't really WOW me with the price they charge.. . Food display is kind of spread out so no long wait line to get the food. However, putting the food inside the heavy pot... not too convenience. First, the lid is way too heavy & hot. Also, you have to put down your plate first then open the lid to get the food?? With the lid on, you can't really see what's inside. Not an ideal way to display the food. . . Service is bad. Each server is taking care too many tables. Hard to get the server to refill the drink. . . Not too impressed with the dinning experience.
I like their seafood selections: tiger shrimps and crab legs. The Chinese food doesn't have many varieties and the quality was not impressive neither. The sushi was not great but still okay. The panini was good in my opinion but I am not that much into panini so I might be wrong about it. Overall it's a good buffet place considering the price is fair and the selections are good. I will return to this buffet in the future!
Beautiful ambiance, spacious & great food presentation. The quality of the food is thus far the best buffet I have been to. Great dessert selections. I love the made to order salad. I like how you can chose to include unlimited alcohol.
* Welcome Experience. - Blatantly Bad. . Even for a buffet, this crew was just obnoxious.  . . * Establishment. - Ordinary. . It's a buffet.  It feels like a buffet.  It looks like a buffet. Nothing worth mentioning here.  . . * Service. - Ordinary. . Our server was prompt, friendly and attentive.   . . * Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation. - Somewhat Encouraging (it's a buffet!). . I don't know should I write a review of buffet food or tell you how the food was at this buffet?  Ok I'll do both.... . Buffet food: Ambitious!  They are innovative and are trying to do cool things!  Exotic(ish) entrees appear throughout the sectioned-off buffet and new ideas seem to be welcome here as they have small bites and cool combinations available.  For example.... . A charcuterie section was a good try.  Tillamook cheddar and cheap lunchmeat slices made it a miss.  . . Small bites glasses full of various salads was a cool idea.  I tried Thai beef and it was just ok.  (A piece of cheap roast-beef lunchmeat in a glass with some dressing and greens.). . Stunning (looking) desserts will please the eye but disappoint the taste buds (IMHO.) . . The food if it were not a buffet:  No good!  For the novelty of a buffet, variety and quantity, this place is your spot.  For good food you need to find another dining experience elsewhere.  . . * What I'll remember. . - The Mecca of glistening desserts - I SO WISH my mouth's experience matched my eyes'!. . What I can't wait to forget. . The dried out brisket.  The sawdust rice.  The decaying Shu Mai.  The velveeta Mac and cheese.
Nothing special, but nothing terrible either. Not worth complaining about when it's comped, but I would literally NEVER pay the sticker price.. . If you like Prime Rib and Beef Brisket you won't leave hungry, although at a buffet that's not saying much. . . Some times the crab legs are awesome, but most of the time they just look like absolute garbage. Same with the Pizza. They used to have the greatest pesto pizza ever, but not since the remodel, which is a real shame.. . The overarching theme of this buffet is probably "unrealized potential." A lot of the food would be really good if made to order, but unfortunately they just make a ton of everything and leave it to sit and get soggy, burnt or otherwise go from great to gross.. . The sushi, for example, is made using good fish, then put on a tray, covered in plastic wrap and left to sit in a fridge until the rice is hard and it's just garbage. Same with the burritos and the asian food. A lot of the issues would be solved, I think, if they just made smaller portions more often.. . The guacamole, mashed potatoes, prime rib, basically anything that the quality doesn't go downhill when it sits out, are all amazing. Anything where the quality degrades though, expect it to be disgusting.. . I just think this place is funny because they definitely have the potential to be a 5-star buffet, but they seem pretty content to be very mediocre.
Great! Buffet! It has a bright, modern atmosphere and lots of choices that are a little lass conventional like the mediteranian section and the dim sum. Service was great, and the layout was easy to figure out. You cant beat the price here, and the bottomless drinks at that!
Good Food. Fantastic Service. Unethical Business Practices.. . We ate there every day while staying at Aria from 17-23 December 2013 due to a promotion where they provided a $68 buffet voucher per night.. . The food variety is relatively small to other places but the quality is top notch.. . The wait staff is second to none. They were super attentive and friendly and collectively made the best service experience I've ever had in Vegas.. . So here's the bad part. Two days in to our voucher deal they nearly doubled the price per person for the buffet. They called it "Holiday Brunch" or something like that. Nothing changed (food or service) except for the price which went up $20 dollars per person. The "free" buffet deal turned out to be anything but. The place wasn't even more crowded than usual.. . I understand Vegas exists to vacuum the cash out of your bank account but the gimmick pulled by Aria's management over the buffet price amounted to cheating their customers. . . Don't treat your customers like complete suckers and they may just return with their business. It's no wonder MGM resorts posts billions in losses on a regular basis.
I've tried several Vegas buffets over the last few years and really enjoyed this one. We went to the buffet around 4:30 on a weekday and there was no wait and it wasn't too crowded. The layout seems smaller and more compact than at some buffets which means I think they slightly less variety of food options, but what they do offer was top notch. The carving station BBQ pork shoulder was excellent and the brisket was good as well but a little fatty. I really enjoyed the Mexican fajita bar, with the barbacoa being one of the most tasty buffet meats I've enjoyed in quite a while. If you enjoy like I do you'll like their seafood station. They feature king and snow crab legs which are served hot and cold and were tasty and fresh without being stringy. One older guy who was sucking down crab legs when we arrived and still going strong as we left so he apparently approved of them. The chilled shrimp cocktail shrimp were tasty and the scampi had one of the largest shrimp I've seen anywhere. The desserts were tasty and featured an enjoyable pecan pie and large ice cream selection among other items.. . This buffet is a little lacking in selection compared to some others but I enjoyed everything and will return. I'd say this is a 4 star buffet if you like seafood and 3 starts if you're not a fan. With the 2 for 1 special through My Vegas this was an even better deal!
This was the only buffet we tried (first time visitors) so we don't have anything to compare it to in town. It was nice and at $40/pp reasonably priced. The variety is small but great tasting, and I could have eaten the Na'an all night. The husband enjoyed the brisket. Everything was clean and bright but a bit too cafeteria style for my taste. Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if it's convenient it's a good option.
Let me start by saying when I booked my 4 day culinary excursion to Las Vegas, it included 2 free buffets at The Aria. That means that my friend and I had a $68 credit for the Buffet for 4 days. This is FAT BOY status...::grinch smile =). Aria also has a $12.99 Bottomless Wine, Mimosa, Beer, Heineken, Peach Bellini, Sangria, Mimosa, list is endless, drinky drink thing you can add on to any buffet. That itself is worth it's weight in gold!The flippin desserts!! They are world class! I'm pretty sure the people that make the dessert at Jean Phillipe downstairs make the desserts for the buffet. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better they add the new gelato "wheel of fortune" machine. I loved the Mandarin Yuzu flavor, it was a citrus explosion! Not too sour, not too sweet, and Yuzu has such a unique flavor. I destroyed the Vanilla Dulche Brownie flavor as well. Ahhh...so many flavors, so little time. Red Velvet Cupcakes, Strawberry Cheesecake with the little Aria chocolate square stuck in the middle like a ninja star, the Blood Orange Panna Cotta, The Carrot Cake, The Flan with the Raspberry on top...Raspberry plus Flan = Fireworks! My absolute favorite is the Pecan Pie. My friend's mom makes it every new year and I tell her that I will pay her for racks of this stuff, but she never believes me! Aria does not play they add a dollop of espresso, then they stack a little chocolate surfboard on top that with some gold specks. On the side of the plate is a streaky blob of caramel sauce. Heaven on earth! My slogan was Pecan Pie? Das Eriday! The Espresso takes it from great to amazazing! That is just some of desserts!. . Remember there's still food! I always hit up the carving station. I just get the juicy wings off the roasted chicken and a couple pieces of brisket with some bbq sauce. Hits the spot everytime. Then I hit up the crab legs, not just crab legs. Aria knows better than that! They are pre-split in half!  So you just grab your mountain of crab and just pick out the meat. Everytime I eat crablegs, I get mad because they are not split this way. I liked the little fish and chips that came in a little fryer basket too. . . I kept it simple and rotated everything that I mentioned for 3 days, the 4th day we ate at Sage. Lunch is only $23 with the bottomless drink $13. You seriously cannot beat that! Having it included with your stay is just stupid good. . . Tip: If the line is long, go on the left side for Sky Suites members and you can just skip on in! Then, you can watch the line as you eat like a bowss!
There's nothing so spectacular here that warrants a really great review. The food was mediocre - definitely not what I expected from such a new, and excitingly modern hotel. Crab legs were cold, and nothing really jumped out and screamed "FRESH!" To me. However, they do have moscato d'asti on the "all you can drink" additional option (for $12) - so I was able to get my money's worth out of that. I'm disappointed I paid full price for the dinner buffet. Rookie mistake. I wouldn't return.
