This show is just ok. If the tickets were half the price I would have enjoyed it more. For the money it just wasn't that great. It reminds me so much of Zombie Burlesque which you can go see for a fourth of the price.
The show really should not be using the Cirque name - granted there is some acrobatics involved, but it is nowhere to the degree that it can do the Cirque branding justice. . . What is really is is a series of disjointed burlesque skits with no real sense of transition in between. Fully understanding that this is the "Vegas/sensual" side of Cirque, and as I guy, I surprise myself by saying this, but there was way too much toplessness, to the point where it seemed like that was the point of the show and it kind of felt cheap.. . The humor at the pre-show was great, and since I had a student discount, the ticket prices were low as well, but I can't say I would recommend this show to anyone (and judging how it was ~70% full it seems like I'm not the only one). . . If you have a high tolerance for raunchy/crude/mildly racist humor, Absinthe is overall a much better version of the show. It just seems much more put together.
I love cirque shows, but this one has a lot to be desired for. Although the theme is sensuality, they seem to do it a bit crudely. The acrobats were amazing however and it easy to see how skilled they are.
I absolutely love the show and have seen it three times.  It will be on my itinerary next time I am in Vegas.. . It is athletic, sensual, fun.  If you are uptight sexually or a right wing Conservative, I would suggest you go see Donny and Marie instead!!!. . If you go see the show, do your best to get a loveseat up front so you can be an interactive participant.  Loads of laughter!!!
This show is SEXY. The most-used word to describe Zumanity is "sensual," but they fail to mention that it's also hilarious! There are dance acts, acrobatic acts, water performances, gay, lesbian, and kinky dominatrix scenes. All of this is broken up with comedic numbers to lighten the mood in-between, including numerous audience-participation segments that are both awkward and super funny. If you're not laughing, you're sitting there with your eyes glued to the action on stage, trying hard not to look outwardly aroused. However, I do wish the tickets were a bit cheaper. Although it isn't heavy with acrobatics or awe-inspiring like other Cirque shows I've seen, Zumanity is highly entertaining and engrossing. Definitely a fun time!
This show was so much fun!. . This was my first Cirque show, so I can't really compare it to any other shows. I have seen Le Reve though (kind of Cirque-y?), and I have to say that Zumanity has a completely different vibe. I can see why some people wouldn't like this show, but I thought it was hillaaaarious and amazing.. . Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought that Zumanity had a good amount of acrobatic performances! The bowl act in the beginning was spectacular. I was a little surprised because I didn't expect the acrobats to be topless, but it was so beautifully done that I didn't even mind! Little did I know, there would be a lot more topless acrobats haaaaahaha. Coming from Berkeley, where I see naked people every semester in the naked run, I didn't mind at all. I thought it was totally fine! Some acts were tastefully done, some acts were not. But I don't think Zumanity is trying to be a "tasteful" type of show - it's meant to shock and entertain you! The acts were so funny and I had a blast during the entire show.. . I bought a ticket through a half price ticket booth, so I paid about $87 for a pretty great seat. Would I pay full price for this show? Probably not, because I'm pretty cheap. I actually don't think this show is worth full price - I would recommend Le Reve or a different Cirque show if you're paying full price.. . This is not a highbrow kind of show - definitely not for the fainthearted. Zumanity is definitely for people who like silly, dirty jokes and don't mind seeing a bunch of naked people. I laughed SO much during this show, and I'm glad I saw it.
This was my first time in Vegas (I know, a little late) and the first show I saw. Let's just say it set the bar pretty high for the rest of them! There were several scenes with different acts and props which made the show even more interesting because you just didn't know what to expect. It was also nice that the show was addressed to everyone no matter if you're gay or straight... or even a threesome??. . I would recommend coming with people you're comfortable with sexually. So unless you want to sit there awkwardly next to your parents, I would come with friends or a significant other because it could get uncomfortable if you're a shy person. The show was pretty explicit and uses audience participation which was definitely the best part and hilarious!! I know they definitely had the time of their lives ;D
Had an amazing time at the show. I sat in the second row, behind the love seats. I loved that they play and include the audience.  My boyfriend was picked on multiple times and I thought it was hilarious. This was my first time in vegas and the first show I saw. It was amazing. I loved it and would go over and over again. Expensive but a great time.
My favorite Cirque du Soleil show (I've seen LOVE, La Nouba in Orlando, and Kooza when it was in Philadelphia), but this one is definitely the best. Contrary to other reviews, there's still a high amount of acrobatics, only it's on a smaller scale. Very intimate theater (can't really go wrong with any seats), but if you're super super shy and don't want Edie the Drag Queen to confront you, DON'T buy the tickets in the front rows. This was the funniest and most interactive Cirque du Soleil and on top of that, Antonio the Gigolo is SO SEXY. But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not go with any family members. My friend and I saw lots of families awkwardly sitting there pre and post show and arguments started in the gift shop.
Great show from Cirques Du Soleil! Amazing actors, really funny and wonderful. This show is "must seen" in Vegas! The only thing to keep in mind: try to get tickets closer to center.
Unless you want to have a REALLY good time tonight, I would suggest picking some balcony seats ;). . This show was super cheesy, hilarious, and sexy at the same time. Guarenteed a good time.. . You better be comfortable to your sexuality though and hopefully the people you're sitting next two, b/c there were a few awkward momements... and a whole lot of nudity. . . Other than that, single, taken, married, lesbian, gay, threesome... whatever yor thing is, they've got something for you.. . One of my favorite parts of the show is the audience participation (the people closest to the stage). Luckily for our show, the audience members that participated were good sports and therefore made a hilarous, fun and entertaining segment for the rest of us!. . The only thing I would have liked is maybe more acrobatics as opposose to dancing since it is a cirque du soleil show, but there was enough to satisfy me.. . Overall, a good entertaining and fun show!
I wasn't expecting much from this show - for many reasons... . . Shows (like cards) bore me to tears and I'm happiest behind a big slot machine! I go to Vegas to gamble - all I do when I'm there is gamble. And eat occasionally. And drink constantly. . . I hosted a bachelor/bachelorette party and we decided to see a show as a group. Again, I wasn't expecting much and already had a get-away plan ready just in case I decided to fake sick - just to go throw my money away in a big slot machine!. . Wrong! This show was amazing, kept us all laughing the whole time. I loved the sexiness, the sinfulness and the sheer playfulness.. . I will definitely see this again in a few years as I'm sure the show won't change much front month to month.
Absolutely the best show in vegas to date! The two obese french maid sisters that roam through the isles make the show for me!
Such a great time here nothing but laughs. Very sexual and sensual and allot. Of talent. I sat in the middle I don't regenerate how much were the tickets but it was worth it even tho I left early due to personal reasons lol
