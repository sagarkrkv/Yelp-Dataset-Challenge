Decent place, not my favorite casino. The rooms are nice, though not very clean. We had food stuck to our ceiling. Additionally you are charged a resort fee for things they know you won't use. Who uses the gym in Vegas? They only allow wifi connections in room for one device. Not worth the ridiculous resort fee per night.
Casino - 4 stars. Vegas casinos always have some ingenious ways to get you to stay and gamble, further parting you from your hard earned money.  They ply you with free alcohol (albeit rather weak), lavish buffets, headliner shows, and if you are degenerate enough - free rooms.  Planet Hollywood Casino takes this to another level.  What better way to distract you from your concentration at the blackjack table than by situating scantily clad go-go dancers right in front of you.  I don't even want to think of how many hands I effed up because of them.  I was like a kid with ADHD who had just emptied his last bottle of Ritalin.  On top of that, many of the dealers are attractive women dressed in lingerie.  I might as well just donate my money into a drop box. There aren't a whole lot of gaming tables here, but who is complaining when you have go - go dancers. Slots and video poker are found throughout in relatively smaller amount.  The games seem to be some of the older ones. But the odds on these seem fairly good as I came up on them.. . Hotel - 3 stars. There are 2 very interesting things about the standard rooms here.  One is that each room is a movie theme.  Mine was Independence Day.  They have some piece of memorabilia in the room for that movie.  Ours was a skirt that some lady wore...we could not turn off the light illuminating it and I would wake up in the middle of the night with a lit up khaki skirt staring me in the face.  The other is that there is no main light switch that controls the lights in the room.  So I found myself going to each and every lamp to turn them off.  Big plus is the tub in the bathroom is large.  But the ghetto factor comes in when some of the toiletries they give you have the Paris Hotel label on them.. . But with Gordon Ramsey Burgr, the Miracle Mile Shops, Pink's and the Earl of Sandwich, PH makes for a decently valued stay that is solidly middle class and won't break your bank.
The Good:. - GREAT location, in between the City Center (Cosmo, Aria) and Paris, adjacent from Bellagio fountains. - EARL OF SANDWICH; recently discovered my love for their tuna melts. . - GYM/SPA: If you're staying long enough in Vegas and want to get gym/spa time in, bring a bathing suit because there is a free jacuzzi & dry/steam sauna in the gym area (2 free pass limit per room a day, $25/pp after that).. . Kinda cool:. - All the rooms have different movie themes, including props from movie sets. We stayed in the "Eraser"-themed room. . The MEH:. - Beds were slightly uncomfortable and the casino & rooms (also factoring in the dry climate + smokers) had very stale, dry air. All my friends agreed.. . . . Meeting Mr. Schwarzenegger at the Planet Hollywood gym.. PRICELESS. http://instagram.com/p/ipexczAyMV/. . . . . . . . . . . . . Shouts to weekend roomies JY & Young Rich
A great hotel and casino with lots of action. Very upbeat, great variety of places to eat and shop. Great gambling, friendly staff, awesome pool! I really love staying here due to the location and the overall excitement of PH!
I've stayed here twice and I liked it both times. It is very clean and quiet, not as luxe as some of the other hotels, but nice enough. It has a much cooler feel than Treasure Island. The location is amazing, and you can get your fabulosity fix right across the street at Cosmo/Bellagio/Aria. . . I booked several rooms here for CES and found their phone booking agent to be super pleasant, and when we checked in, the desk agent was accomodating and patient. The person who checked us out must have been new or tired (it was 5am and there was a long line of several people checking out). We were charged for internet access even though it was included in the resort fee. He did take it off, but only after it was pointed out.. . Regarding the resort fee, they are standard operating procedure for Vegas hotels. Ceasar's properties used to advertise that they didn't have a fee, but those days are over. I just see it as a very high internet-access fee. . . The two Starbucks locations were great, Earl's of Sandwich was the perfect cheap mid-day meal, and the dudes running the taxi line were great. PH is definitely a 4 star worth returning to on my next inevitable desert pilgrimage.
Unfortunately there is not a star lower than zero. Because that's what Planet Hollywood in Vegas deserves.. The Good:. Its a hotel. . The bad:. When I put my head down to go to bed I found 3 out of my 4 pillows were bloody. Not just that the sheets were dirty! So gross! . . DO NOT STAY AT PLANET HOLLYWOOD VEGAS. They have dirty sheets with blood on them.. . So Gross!
I've stayed at PH twice - both times were during CES week (2013 and 2014). The hotel is conveniently located on the strip and very close walking distance to City Center. Affordable rooms that are much higher in quality than their neighbor, Paris.  Each room is decorated with a movie theme featuring memorabilia from the actual film.  The King rooms I stayed in were standard and spacious. It's not fancy like Aria or Cosmopolitan but for the price it's within reason.. . There was never a long wait for cabs, valet was a breeze (in and out) plus, the casino isn't as congested as other popular casinos. . . My only gripe about PH is the high price to use the gym (fitness center). I paid $25/day to use it and even though they keep it stocked with fresh fruit and ice cold water it just isn't worth it. Maybe $10-$15/day would have been more suitable.
Planet Hollywood seems to be one of the smaller properties on the strip. The entire place is the shape of a disc with the Miracle Mile shops on the outside, and the casino in the middle. . . Though this place isn't entirely non-smoking like the Vdara, the lobby, Starbucks, and the room elevators can be accessed from the ground floor without having to inhale second-hand smoke. The rest of the shops are upstairs, but being newly renovated, doesn't smell as bad as older properties.. . The rooms are fairly clean - and let's face it - high volume areas like Las Vegas are bound to have dirty sheets from time to time. Ours were clean but despite the recent renovation, the place is starting to deteriorate in certain areas. The carpet outside wasn't installed properly and it has clearly deformed. Some of the paint has small nicks and chips. But again, minor details, and overall everything was reasonably clean.. . Only downside that doesn't change is that the rooms are dark. They need more light fixtures closer to the door area and another light fixture over the TV cabinet or something.. . The second downside, probably the largest, is that wifi is $14/day with one device included in the resort fee. One Wi-Fi enabled device per day is just tacky but at least we had a mobile hotspot.. . And the last downside is that for our Hollywood memorabilia, we had a wedding dress  parked right next to the TV. Kind of creepy, kind of weird, but OK I guess.. . For all the downsides with how small the place is, the shops are budget friendly and there is an Earl of Sandwich open 24 hours. And if the place is too small, being placed right in the middle of the strip means that you can walk over right next door to the half dozen other properties to do whatever else you want. . . The buffet's not really worth it here though, go to Paris or the Bellagio or the Cosmopolitan or Caesar's Palace.. . TL;DR. Rooms 3.25/5. Location 5/5. Shops 4/5. Buffet 2.9/5
Clean moderately priced hotel. Came in during CES week and paid about 160$ a night for 4 nights. Got a smoking room, you can hear plumbing next door, stains in the bath and toilet from cigg burns, sitting chair had white stains on it. It costs 5$ for hot water! It seems it's always the expensive hotels that don't have a microwave, coffeemaker, fridge, and charge an arm and a leg for stuff like hot water, and wifi.  Anyhow I got smart and just heated up my water with a glass cup and the iron. PH you think you can work me, but no no no.. LOL.
EEK  this was bad. I've stayed at a hotel or 10 in Vegas before and based on the downstairs and even the buffet I thought this place was going to be nice! Boy was I wrong!. . The hallways are dark and scary with ripped and torn carpet. Each room has it's own 'decoration' or motif if you want to call it that. I was lucky enough to get the Fred Flinestone room. I had bones in my room, YEP! that's right kiddies BONES.  it was gross. My other friend was lucky enough to get the 90210 bedroom which did not include bones. . . The beds are extremely uncomfortable, another oddity in Vegas, and the Pillows are the worst I have ever experienced. They are hard as rocks and don't even bend.  They have updated some decorations for Brit Brit, but I am so very, very glad we decided on another hotel when we go back in Feb to see her concert. I would highly advise to stay somewhere else vs this place. What is sad is their location is awesome. They are connected to the Miracle Mile shops, they have a variety of lower priced dining options (PBR Bar and Earl of Sandwich), it's next door to Paris and it's right across the street from the Cosmo...all reasons we thought it would be great!. . They also, like many other hotels, chargea daily resort fee of $25/day. . I never want to stay here again.
I stayed at Planet Hollywood from 1/9-1/13 for my birthday and I really liked it there. It's a great location because a lot of the other hotels are within walking distance. And if you forgot anything, there's a Walgreens around the corner. Score. . . I was really pleased with their customer service, Shawn at the front desk was really nice during my check in. And somewhere along the line during my drunk stay, I met the bellhop and housekeeping lady and they were super friendly as well. I wish a got the name of the girl who worked at the pleasure pit at the roulette table because it's fun to gamble with someone with a great attitude and fun personality. I didn't win but I still had fun. . . My room was on the 31st floor and the view was amazing. I was able to see the fountains from my window.
All time new favorite place to stay on the Strip. . . Reasons?. 1. Open face Black Jack tables with single deck, minimum $15.00 bet, and awesome dealers like Kimmy. Dunno who Kimmy is? Damn, you missed out. Firecracker upbeat awesome card dealer who made my first gambling experience super fun! :) . 2. Smack in the middle of the strip. Perfect distance from Marquee and Caesars with the Planet Hollywood shopping mall attached. #winning . 3. BurGR. Chow down my friends, chow down. . 4. I took the airport shuttle from the airport to the strip. What number stop was PH? Stop number 2 baby WOOOHOO! ($7.50 for one way trip.) . 5. Overpriced Starbucks but nevertheless, I'm thankful for the coffee. . 6. Super responsive to asking for extra towels, blankets etc. Props to efficiency.. . Will be back again, so thanks PH for the relatively cheap rates!
this is the ONLY casino i won money at so obviously it's the best :) dealers are super nice. it was my first time playing craps and they were so helpful in explaining the game to me and helping me out.
We love this hotel, and now stay here every time.  But sad we haven't won even a little bit on the slots.  But we mainly play poker. Party atmosphere with music and dancers
I stayed here for 5 nights/6 days. Hotel room was very clean and spacious and the beds were super comfy. Lookout from the 37th floor and you'll think you're looking out over the surface of Mars. I was psyched that our room was Jim Carrey themed which comprised of a photo of the moped scene in Dumb & Dumber when they ride to Aspen, the tux he wore in the airport scene, and a portrait of him in The Mask. I can't express how much I loved the theme.. . Planet Hollywood is located smack in the middle o' the strip making it incredibly easy to get around. . . BurgR on the casino floor has a great craft beer selection that runs you ~$7 for a 20 oz. cup. Not too shabby.. . $5 dollar 3-card poker and craps tables available on off-peak days, all day. Crystal and Olya at the passion pit won me $300. Sure they're scantily clad but they know their stuff brought me some good luck. . . After wandering around other Casino's in the area, Planet Hollywood is easily my favorite. It is clean, well-lit, classy but not pretentious, and everyone I interacted with was uber friendly. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.
Planet Hollywood no more!  bye bye.  After coming here for the past several years we no longer will spend our holiday vacation here any more.  . . I stayed here the end of December and encountered a slew of problems!  some much more major than others.  Stayed 3 days and had 2 rooms booked.  Upon arrival and check-in, one of the rooms were not cleaned.  Called front desk which told us to talk to housekeeping.  Housekeeping said that they would not clean the room because it was past a certain time...the room did not get cleaned till 5 hours later...Had to call several times and get the run around!  . . Another issue MAJOR issue occurred was that there was not any hot water!  Halfway through my shower it went from hot to cold!  luckily we had another room to use and there was hot water.  This happened 2 of the 3 days there...  . . Some smaller issues.  Busted toilet!  Ended up having a toilet that kept running/flushing.  We told housekeeping and nothing was done.  3 days running water.  The hotel asks patrons to conserve energy and water and doesn't do anything to wasting water.  The tv in one of the other rooms had poor quality and the picture was over extended.  you could not tell what channel you were on because it was not properly displayed.  also the volume on the tv was just loud! one room was fine.  . . Explained all the issues to the front desk when checking out and only the resort fees were comped...i even mentioned that due to these problems that i would not be coming back.  the guy was ok letting me go.  . . skip the gym.  limited hours and super small.  not what i was expecting at all
I stayed at PH from 1/25 to 1/28/2014. It  was my first time staying on the strip. I would stay here again because:. . 1. The price is fantastic. Very affordable. Allows me to waste more of my money gambling or eating or buying Las Vegas themed magnets or whatever foolishness I might be getting into. . . 2. Great location - easy access/quick walk to so many other places. . . 3.  Connected to the Miracle Mile shopping mall which allows for a larger variety of stores (for booze, water, snacks, assorted Las Vegas themed junk) and restaurants (not to mention the shopping). . . 4. If you're staying on the North side of PH you have a picturesque view of the Bellagio fountains and strip.. . 5. Rooms were decorated and clean. (I had the Jessica Lange room) Easy to use in-room safe. Plenty of storage space. I was in a basic room and it included a full size ironing board and iron, as well as a hair dryer. The tv was poor quality and difficult to use (I know, it's a tv right?). There was a delay in changing channels so you had to wait a long time to figure out what channel you were on. When I was able to access the guide for shows, I couldn't get out of it no matter what I did and had to turn off the tv and turn it back on. There wasn't any explanation in the room as to how to use it, etc. or what channels were what as there usually is. I only watched tv while getting into bed for the night anyway, so it wasn't much of an issue - only an annoyance. The resort fee (about $20/day) includes use of the gym and use of wifi for one device per room. So if you have 2 ipads or whatever that need wifi, you'll only be able to connect (through the resort fee) to one device. I think additional wifi is $15/day. . . 6. I really don't have any complaints other than the fact that I spent most of my time disoriented in the PH casino. It's probably just me (I'm an idiot 90% of the time), but the casino there was laid out so that (for me) it was hard to determine what was where. Even after 4 days in the place, I was still wandering around not entirely sure where I was or how to get where I was supposed to be going. . . 7.  Friendly staff. . . I'd recommend PH and would stay there again. If you're looking for something easy, convenient, and affordable, this is a good option. It's no Cosmopolitan or Bellagio, so if you're looking for super swanky, this is not the place for you. It is not a luxury hotel. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be fine.
First room (#744) had a wonderful view of the roof. A huge roof. That's about it. Grout in shower looked moldy, furniture scratched/ broken, lights didn't work. New room was a little better, but furniture again beat up pretty bad. Scratched.. drawers missing. . . Location is great! Can't beat it. Mall pretty neat too. PH suffers from what they all do, the maze of the hotel/casino/mall. Maybe I am not good with directions but it took me 10-15 minutes just to get in or out of the building. And I get it, forces people to walk past more stores, and casino things. But doesn't make it less annoying.. . . Side note.. non smoking floor smells like smoke. And has ash trays on the hall. Even under the non smoking signs. Kind of annoying.. . overall, slept good in the comfortable bed. Room was quiet. And room seemed mostly clean. Depending on price, I'd return.
For the last 4 years my girlfriends and I have made Vegas an annual birthday trip. . . For the past 3 years we have stayed at Planet Hollywood for the following reasons:. . 1. Location - it is very central to the strip (you've got Paris to your right and Caesars down the block) and the mall that it's in (Miracle Mile Shops) has everything you might need: an ABC store, Sephora (in case you forgot your eyeliner at home or need free Wi-Fi haha). Fashion Show Mall and Crystals City Centre are about equivalent walking distance in opposite directions from Planet Hollywood so when I say central, I mean VERY central. Right down the street in front of Paris you can buy a ticket for $7 for the Express transportation train that will take you to both the South/North end of the strip (North/South Premium outlets) and the ticket is good for 24 hours - would definitely save you some cab fair for clubbing too. . 2. The ceilings in the hotel casino seem to be higher than other hotels I've stayed at (Treasure Island, PH towers) which makes for better ventilation - this is a huge plus for me because I am pretty sensitive to the smell of smoke which I know is difficult to avoid in Vegas. . . 3. The rooms and suites are super clean - really cool movie memorabilia in each room. Bathrooms are great (also very clean) and the shower pressure is a 10 in my books. When I stayed at their sister hotel (PH Towers) the water pressure in the shower made me not want to shower - it was like someone standing there holding a watering pot pouring it slowly onto your head.. . 4. Planet Hollywood is a participating buffet in "The Buffet of Buffets" which is something my girlfriends and I do EVERY time we're in vegas. Spice Market buffet is a good option for breakfast or lunch, and is so conveniently located downstairs from the casino so if you go out the night before and have too good of a time and wake up hungover and lazy you just have to walk downstairs for food LOL. . . Planet Hollywood has been good to us and we haven't found a reason to look elsewhere. Sure there are more "glamorous" or "high end" options but if you're looking for an above average hotel for a fun trip to Vegas then Planet Hollywood is definitey worth the money! Rates tend to be pretty competitive too.
