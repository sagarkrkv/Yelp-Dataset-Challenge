Stayed in the 11th floor in room 334. No view of strip but the beautiful mountains. Great service - as always. Monte Carlo has won me over with food selection, amenities, location, and price. Great job!
The Monte Carlo is not upscale, but it gets the job done. Cause seriously, who really sleeps in Vegas?. . We got two rooms here 3 days, 4 nights and it was truly affordable. Rooms are spacious and clean.. . There's a variety of shops, bars, restaurants, and even fast food here.. . It was a big plus when the Jabbawockeez were still performing there cause their gift shop was stocked with their t-shirts.. . I would definitely stay here again if I was back in town.
We just left after staying 3 nights 1/1/14-1/4/14.  Here are the pros and cons. . Pros-. Free Tram that goes to Aria and Bellagio.. . Location is somewhat central, but still on the south side, tram really helps time wise getting down the strip.. . Inexpensive. . Cons-. Small Rooms with PAPER THIN walls. . No fridge or microwave in room. . No bathrobe. . No real theme to hotel, nothing that makes it fun or unique. . In Conclusion-it's fine for a cheap place on the strip, if you can stay at Paris, Planet Hollywood or Ny Ny for a similar price I'd pick them
Monte Carlo is one of those hotels in which people wither love or hate it. Based on the mixed reviews on yelp (many of which aren't too great) I would have stayed away from this place. But the bf found a great deal here (originally we booked 2 nights at Luxor, but for about the same price, Monte Carlo offered 3 nights instead. Score!) Let's begin:. . Our Room Floor 21, #113 (3.5/5 stars):. - It had a nice king size bed, 2 night stands, desk & chair, lounge chair, average sized dresser with a fairly large flat LCD tv, closet and full length mirror, 2 telephones.. My only complaint is that there was no mini fridge to store our drinks (this should be a standard every where). Also, the "temperature control unit" had poor circulation and weak output so it took awhile to get the room cool to the temp that we enjoyed. The view we had was not of the strip, but of the back of NYNY and residential area. It wasn't a bad view, in fact it looked nice at night when all the homes had on their twinkling lights or in the morning when the sun would rise in the horizon. It was a relaxing and peaceful sight. You can hear riders from the NYNY coaster scream their heads off, not to mention your neighbors in the adjoining rooms practically fart in their sleep because the walls are so thin. That's my main gripe. The bed was comfortable and there were both firm and soft pillows. The sheets were soft and clean, pretty standard nothing bad about them, but nothing spectacular either.. . Bathroom (3/5 stars):. - shower/tub combo with vanity mirror over the sink. The toilet was off to the side in front of the shower with a wall as a divider from the sink. The shower pressure was not the best, and the shower head didn't have a wide spread so it felt like I was a flower and a gardener was trickling water over me. And since the shower/tub floor had a textured feeling to keep you from slipping, if you decided to take a bath be warned! Don't try to scoot across  it or else risk skinning your bottom. Lol. Didn't happen to me, but definitely has the potential. Also, there is a vent that doesn't really suck out any of the steam in the bathroom so if you shut the door, you're in an instant sauna once you finish your hot shower. And don't be startled if you hear a loud whoosh! Sound late at night,  it's just the incredibly loud toilet flushing. Every person who used their toilet, I could hear it flush! Not attractive. . . Casino (2.5/5 stars):. Didn't really play the slots here, but did walk around and it seemed to have updated machines. Only problem is if you have sensitive smelling or breathing conditions, I wouldn't suggest walking through it. Just getting off the elevators from our room to the food court area adjacent to the casino I was already having a coughing fit from all the smoke. Their ventilation system isnt good. . . Overall, I give Monte Carlo 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because their customer service is phenomenal. The clerk at check in was kind, personable, and quick. The cleaning staff is nice and on time. We changed out our towels a couple times and had our bed sheets changed once, they were great. Also, the bell hop and valet people were friendly and courteous. They never acted like they needed to be tipped, like many others I've experienced. But generally appreciated their helping us out. That's what makes a hotel good: a hardworking, respectful staff. . . Don't be afraid to stay here because of some of the negative feedback by some yelpers (hey, even five star hotels have their share of horror stories). For it's price and LOCATION on the strip, it is definitely a great value hotel. I would stay here again.
Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino is a fun place to stay. Good services and gaming. The pool area is awesome, Lazy River, Wave Pool, Outside Bars and a large area to lay out and get some sun. The tram is very close to get to other places on the strip. The rooms are very nice for the price. Overall a really fun place to stay in Las Vegas.
Stayed here over New Years and had a blast! Location wise, it couldn't have been a more better location on the Strip then this one! NYE was so much fun here!! Got an upgrade of our room to high floor deluxe and super comfy bed! Casino wise, couldn't ask for more and lots of dining, Blue Man Group and shops all around. Thank you Monte Carlo for a great stay!
Monte Carlo is an affordable hotel in near the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  This hotel had been renovation few years ago, pump the hotel class from 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars.  It located north of New York New York and next to Aria.  . . Parking structure is easy in this hotel; you can easily access to the self-parking lot and can walk to the hotel in few minutes of walk. The parking escalator was fill with cigarette smell; I did not bother going back then.. . The hotel room elevator is located across the lobby, the nice thing you do not need walks by the casino.  The room's elevators are separate by three different floors level.  That was good-crowed control. Our group came just right before the standard check in time 3pm in Sunday.  There has was about 20 peoples in the line, took about half hours before it was our turn.  The clerk was helpful and we were able to get a high floor level as we request.  The view was the city center (Aria, Vdara and the pool) It was good view despite this just a basic room.  At top of that our 2 booked room were together and also in a corner.  You would always wanted corner room if want peace in Zzz.. . The room is modern; there is a big 42-inch flat screen.  However, sadly the channel were not in HD, make it look worse than SD.  One of the room amenities included 2 K-Cup Coffee Pack and two water bottles.  Those were included with the resort fee, which cost almost $23. I wish there is Wi-Fi in the room, only wired is available.  To use Wi-Fi has to go down to lounge level. The room was clean and everything was functional.  The bed and the pillow were very soft, perhaps more than the way I like it.  I had trouble sleep with the bed had to take another night to get used to it.. . Their casino floor is modern as well; I was impress with their sport betting room.  Look more modern than five star hotel like Wynn.  The smell of the cigarette is not strong in the casino floor, unlike some other casino I been to.  There is free tram access to Crystal Center, Aria, and Bellagio. wish it also link the tram to Excalibur, so it can access to the southern strip.. . Overall, this is good hotel consider the price.  You are only paying half or one third cost of nearby 4 or 5 stars hotel.  While is still in a decent near center strip location.  This hotel can be good choice for family or those who want some peace after some crazy night in club and other activities.
Stayed here for two nights after spending four nights at Mandalay Bay. It was a bit older looking and abused which was to be expected. we had a strip view on the 29th floor and that was nice. Cost was very reasonable but like most properties there was a 20 dollar a day charge for use of the amenities which is annoying. The casino was easy to maneuver through and the food court and casino bar were nice also. Best thing about this place was the smell. It has a very pleasing aroma throughout the entire structure. Overall a good experience. I would stay here again.
I have mixed reviews about this hotel. I like it, but there are a few things that I just can't let go of. Where do I begin..... . I love the lobby here, it gives off a wonderful aura that is Vegas in a classy way. Lots of patrons there to check you in and check you out and they are extremely nice and courteous. My complaint lies with their policy that they cannot guarantee you the exact room that you put a deposit on. My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday. Vegas is a favorite city of mine. He is a smoker, while I am not, but I know the importance of needing to have a smoking room while you are staying at a Vegas hotel. Not sure why Vegas is adapting the California non smoking laws, but it is what it is. When we arrived to check in, we were told that there were no more spa suite rooms on smoking floors. My husband was furious as he should have been. It's such an inconvenience to have to go down to the casino to smoke one cigarette. We called in a manager and he was very nice and apologetic. He offered to upgrade us, but we wanted to spa suite because the spa was in the window overlooking the strip, not in a bathroom. Needless to say, our room was not available, but by the grace of God, a room that was not showing up in the system because it was out of order to to carpet shampooing popped up. We took it. We were given a $100 food and beverage credit from the manager, which was very appreciated and definitely was used while we were there.. . The spa suite was large and spacious. A full bar (not stocked, but I love it when there's a fridge so I can chill my water bottles), separate toilet from the rest of the bathroom, comfortable bed, nice television and the spa was right in the window. The spa was right in the window....overlooking the airport and freeway. Totally sucked, but we did get the room that we wanted. The walls are paper thin here. We could hear the neighbors tv on which seemed to never be turned off, and we could hear anytime a neighbor flushed their toilet, showered and we could totally hear the loud bang every time the toilet stopped running after someone flushed. It woke me up a ton of times throughout the night.. . Other things I'd like to mention:. . Parking structure is easy to get to, ample parking. and totally easy to find your way to and from the hotel from the structure. The mall inside here was great. They have just about everything. Starbucks that is in this hotel is one of the larger ones I've come across in Vegas and they have a good selection of food there as well, we actually found an Italian restaurant here that we ate at both nights we were there, it was delicious (d.vino)!. Clean casino and it didn't reek of cigarettes and booze. I would totally stay here again as long as we were guaranteed the room we booked. A tip that the manager told us: call the day before you're coming so they can block that room out for you so it will be guaranteed.
