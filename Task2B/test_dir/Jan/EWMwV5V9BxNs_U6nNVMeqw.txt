The sweet potato fries did not live up to half their acclaim on here with cinnamon on them and it not being mentioned in the menu. . This wasn't an easy place to eat lighter even ordering an omelette. . The wAiter was great but I was not impressed and will not be running back here
Used to live down here. Wish I would have visited more often. Rosemary chicken sandwich, awesome!
The Fez Burger is the best tasting burger I've had my entire life. With that being said, the service has always been good, and I enjoy the atmosphere inside Fez. A nice selection of different flavored fries puts this spot at the top of my recommended restaurants.
Really great food, more American with a Moroccan twist than the other way around. The cinnamon sugar sweet potato fries are a must, and the fez burger was awesome. The vibe was modern but laid back. Our server was so-so but the other ones looked like they had their stuff together.
Fabulous Brunch as usual! Great Peach Bellini! Our friends from Chicago and San Francisco were taken here by us on their way to the airport to head back home and LOVED it!!!!
This place... how could one not love it?! The drinks are amazing and the price is just right!! I personally recommend the "G Spot" or a martini. The food is excellent here as well. I usually get the Fez burger. I am not sure what all is on it, but I can tell you that it tastes amazing!! So why the 3 stars?... Unfortunately I woke up later that night very ill. Since this place was not the only food I had all day, I can't say for sure that I got sick from here. However, I'm hesitant to visit again now.
The food and service is amazing!
We love the Fez and haven't been here enough.  We did a birthday for my Wife there a number of years ago and other get togethers.  Always busy with good service.
FEZ never disappoints. Consistently delicious food/drinks and fast, attentive service.  Love their hummus, black bean burger, and any of their salads topped with salmon.
One of our downtown Phoenix staples. I love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas. Annnd the spicy harissa fries. ...Aaaand the hummus. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order.
Really good food and drinks but I have felt a little awkward inside at times. It won't deter me from going back but I'll show up with girls next time.
OMG!!!These hotdogs we were  as good as it gets. Delicious!!  Frenchy was so pleasant to speak with.  Thanks for a great experience.  Our bank will be coming back!!
There sweet potato fries are the best.  I love there pomogranite chicken.
Good food, with the mascarpone bruschetta a highlight for me.  We also chose to sit outside on a chilly night, which was a great decision; the staff put on a space heater and we ate in peace since no one else wanted to eat in the "cold."
Two stars for two concerns.  Pretentious service and overcooked food.  Our server had no interest in service, more so going through the motions.  When we were not ready to give him a drink order he took off in a flash.  No questions on preference, nothing about the menu, he just split.  When he did return, a while later, we gave him our drink, app, and entree order all at once.  He did not like that, as later he came back and asked about our entree order again.....  Enough about that guy.  As for the food, the Spicy hummus was well done, a positive.  As for my salmon, way dry and bland.  Even the apricot glaze could not save this one. Overall a busy place and nice atmosphere, and I think it helps compensate for the service and food shortcomings. i will give this one another try, however at this point the Yelp hype was not met at FEZ.
Would definitely recommend! I have been here for numerous work lunches with coworkers and it is always a treat. Known for their burgers, I enjoy their fries even more. You can get cinnamon sweet potato fries, spicy fries, rosemary and garlic fries, or regular salt and pepper fries. Cinnamon sweet potato fries are my favorite, the spicy fries a close second.
In on a weekday around 12:30. Food was very tasty and came out very fast. Doable in a 1 hour lunch break.
I love FEZ, especially for happy hour and reverse happy hour. $3 margaritas and beer. The food is always good (I haven't had a bad meal yet). The food is filling but doesn't make you feel gross. The ambiance is modern and comfortable, the servers and bartenders have always been nice. The sweet potato fries are a must!
Have been a couple of times, once with a group for dinner and once with my wife for lunch. The food and service were excellent on both occasions.
Great drinks specials and apps during happy hour!
I loved the service, and particularly how fresh the food was.  Will be back soon!!
One if the hot spots downtown! There happy hour is pretty decent there burgers are amazing! I love the tangier burger which consists of hummus, sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese!!! Heaven!!
Try the FEZ burger with garlic/rosemary fries. As good as it gets.
