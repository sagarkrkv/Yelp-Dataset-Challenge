Living in San Diego and coming to Vegas every New Year, my family and I came here twice and I have been pleased every time. . . I always get the Nigiri which was fresh and also the Seafood salad is a must get! It's a mixture of different types of fish in a delicious sauce. . . The price you pay for AYCE is well worth it because the portions and quality is on point.
Yama to me, means YUMMY!!! Yummy Sushi!! You have a choice for a la carte or all you can eat. Now if you love sushi as much as I do, Go for the All you can eat! There is no specific time limit like what we have here in the San Fernando Valley. When you look at the menu, look for the one with the * (asterisk sign) those are limited orders per person. Sadly, they limit you on mochi!!! i love mochi!! thats a bit weird since my friend natalie has a dog named mochi!! :/ well anyways, the first time we had came here was in 2012 and I wasn't sure if my family would come here again. However, in 2013 we came here for our Christmas Eve dinner. What can you say about that? Now, what to order? For me.. I am huge on sushi. I will order the sushi first which is tamago(egg), Salmon, Masago, Eel (Unagi), Sweet Shrimp (now this is a treat, because they are limited orders but the head of the shrimp is HUGE and edible and fried). As for drinks, I prefer you order water. Don't drink any drinks that much because the rice will expand and you will definitely get full easily. A favorite for my dad and some of you who have family members, friends who can't tolerate fish... well you can order beef, pork cutlets, chicken, etc. Now, for the main thing to order! is the seafood salad. They put in all different sashimi (tuna, salmon, albacore) into a salad. OMG this is for sure the best appetizer on the menu. So, come on, take a chance on this sushi place. The wait times aren't as bad, since it's off the strip. If you live in Las Vegas or California, definitely check out my blog at tastypalateandfoodie.blogspot.com
I am sad to say that Yama is no longer my favorite AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. I am happy for their success because they were finally able to expand, but their customer service has definitely went down and so did the quality of the food that they offer. . . The few times I have visited lately, the fish was too soft as if it has been sitting out awhile and the rolls seriously lack in flavor. The sauces aren't even helping it out. The customer service is a joke with a gentleman sticking his finger in my face telling me he will be with me in one second. . . But still, definitely the cheapest with the AYCE dinner price of $23.95.
I love sushi and have never been at such a wonderfully delicious restaurant. It is in a strip mall, off the strip, and worth the wait.  All you can eat but not run of the mill sushi....fabulous choices.  The staff is helpful and allow you to order half rolls if you want.  A must for everyone.
Good grade sushi. Well prepared and best of all it's All-you-can-eat!! It's $20 per person for all-you-can-eat and as small as I am I was able to eat at least $50 worth of sushi. If you choose to do the all-you-can-eat make sure you eat all your food otherwise they'll add on an extra charge. You'll leave this place with a very full but happy stomach
Followed Yelp Reviews To Yama on our most recent trip out from LA.  . . Solid! Thoroughly enjoyed our first experience here.  Arrived at 530. Waited 20 min. Finished By 7. Line was about 40 people deep! . . Most of the fish was fresh.  Only the halibut tasted a bit fishy. Uni was a tad gooey but tasted fine. . . We'll be back for sure!
The seafood salad is amazing!  The sushi I thought was 'meh'.  While the names of the special rolls sound interesting, the taste was pretty mediocre.  I'd come back for the seafood salad in a heartbeat though!
I love going here. All you can eat sushi for a decent price. The food is great and the selection as well. The only negative I have is the mochi balls aren't all you can eat.
I've been here about 4 times I always have a good experience although when I went on a very busy Saturday night it was extremely packed and the service took a hit and it's quite packed . Great food end of story highly recommended
My first love. when I strictly only ate specialty rolls because they have the best ones I've had. (Ie. sun of the beach, wet dream, no name). Lately, I've been a nigiri type of guy and yama doesn't really have high quality fish and the rice to fish ratio is ridiculous. They definitely lost touch on their service. always missing an item or two. sometimes I feel rushed but overall I still like the place and it'll forever be a love/hate relationship lol.
Very good Sushi for an amazing price, roughly 25$ a person and its all you can eat!  Everything is usually Fresh, tasty and comes out quickly. Me and the hubby come here anytime we are in Vegas!. . So if it is your first time, you have 2 choices, either AYCE or item by item. If you choose AYCE, you can order anything off the menu, literally everything on there. Start slow, as you do have to eat everything you order or there can be an upcharge, but I assume this is so someone doesn't order 10 rolls and pick off 1 piece of each! You can also order Half rolls of most things, so great way to try them. Nigri is included! Also Sashimi by way of an item called "seafood salad" .. try it spicy, and thank me later! . . Food -  Very good stuff and high quality for the price. Personal favorites . . Seafood Salad Spicy ... 10 stars?!. Be Mine Roll .... Deliciousness . Striptease without the spicy tuna . Deep Fried Mussels . Soft Shell Crab... save the sauce from the seafood salad and dip in there. Miso Soup ... normally dont like this at other places, but here its yum!. Smoked Salmon Nigri .... dont mind if I do . . . Staff ... Very friendly and coming around non stop for drinks, new orders, etc. They are always smiling and fast! . . Ambiance .. So this is the only part that stinks! It is a really small area and everything is kind of cramped. I wish it was larger and more comfortable sitting area, but really if we sat on the floor, I would still go there. So while not a great date place, but amazi
Their food is excellent, service is excellent, I LOVE THERE SEAFOOD SALAD SPICY! Everything is good, except I wish they had a more variety with  desserts overall everything is good, the price, food, and service :)
Good sushi, good price, friendly and attentive service.  It's AYCE, but they make the sushi right when you order it.  It'll take a couple of minutes, but it's worth it. Definitely a great restaurant choice if you want to take a break from the strip.
Awesome AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. Variety of appetizers, sushi and rolls to choose from. You can even order half rolls. Place is small and cramped. Didn't have to wait too long to be seated for lunch. About $25/person.. You'll def get your money's worth - I did! - check out my pics and you'll see I ate enough sushi to last me a few days :) Great customer service. I'd definitely go back. . . Pros: Best value for sushi and nice selection of rolls. Quality doesn't suffer. Ample parking. . . Cons: Tight, cramped seating.
This place always packed for the price no the food it was reasonable. Place small too tied. Service above average. Whoever love sushi this is a place to come for the price
This place is not so consistent whenever we go there.. Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite sushi places but sometimes the wait is long, awkward crowded space, occasionally waiters will mess up orders.. . But the food is a plus! AYCE! Can't go wrong with ordering Salmon Kama, Sun of the Beach Roll, Wet Dream Roll, Salmon Skin Hand Roll, and much more!
If you are a sushi pig like I an, this place is the spot for you! For 25 bucks, you can do the all you can eat sushi option. Honestly, it's not the best sushi I have had personally, but it is still pretty good for what you pay for. I really like the names of the sushi, very adult-oriented. The rolls are made fresh and they come out quickly. Their service is great, never an empty water glass. Any hungry sushi lover should hit this place up. Sushi snobs may want to take a pass on this. Be warned, thus place is pretty popular and there may be a wait!
Before I rave about how much I liked this place, I have to say how much I hate all you yelpers for making me try their wet dream roll. You are all trolls. It was disgusting and I thought I was going to throw up. UGH. . . Now...every thing else was wonderful! I loved the option to do half rolls, so you can try more things! We had their seaweed salad, crab legs, gyoza for apps. Rolls we had who's your daddy, devil, and some others I can't remember. Everything was great, the people working were nice and quick. I highly suggest this place! (But do NOT have the wet dream roll damnt. Dont do it!). . We took the 202 bus from the strip, quick 10 minute ride!
5 stars hands down.  So delicious.  I am so finicky about sushi, and this was hands down the best!  I went a few weeks ago, and I can't even remember what I ordered, but I tried a few different rolls and non rice dishes.  All of them were SO GOOD!
We eat here quite a bit.  It is best if you can go for a late lunch or early dinner, otherwise it is really busy.  Friday and Saturday nights are crazy.  Great food.
My favorite AYCE sushi in Vegas ! No name and sun of the beach are amazing
Great place,  friendly service.   Well run.   The food is very good.   We had about 10 different rolls and they were all great.   Highly recommend this place for all you can eat  and regular dining.
This has become my favorite sushi spot in Vdgas. Took the family for dinner did AYCE for $25 (about) per person. The Superman roll was my favorite as well as the Yobo roll (off menu gotta ask for it). The service was great and the staff was really friendly and attentive. It was a wonderful experience for the fam. & we seriously ate way too much... But it was worth it. Yum!
WET DREAM! WET DREAM! WET DREAM!. . No Yelpers! Take your mind out of the gutter! Wet dream is the BEST roll they have there. God, I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. Creamy with a kick of spiciness from the jalapeno. . . Your trip to Vegas is not complete without stopping by Yama Sushi. It's reasonably priced at $23ish dollars a person for AYCE (sorry I don't have the exact price) but it's definitely worth it.. . They only give an order of Uni and Sweet shrimp to each person, which is fine considering those are the "expensive" types of sushi. I personally loved the Yellowtail and Spicy Tuna handroll. . . They also have mochi ice cream and regular ice cream.. . Don't forget to finish all your food!
The sushi was fine, but after last night's experience, I refuse to ever go back. Here are the reasons:. . 1. A Fire Hazard: Even though the restaurant has recently expanded, it's still the size of an igloo. . . 2. Speaking of cold, the service matches just that. I told the hostess (Cynthia) that it will be a party of five for Angelina. She called me "Angelica" three times. The third time, she did it on purpose only because she knew I was pissed off and tired of correcting her.. . 3. Our waitress would not allow me to share one small piece of sushi with my friend who wanted to try it. The waitress said it was not permitted because my friend wasn't getting all-you-can-eat. If I want to share my food with a friend, I will share my food! I've never ran into that ridiculous rule at any of the MANY sushi joints I've ever been to. . . 4. Watch Your Car, Watch Your Back, Watch Your Belongings: Yama isn't exactly in the type of neighborhood where you can easily sit back and relax. Especially while waiting outside during long waits. There was this one shady dude in particular, who was flying by on a bike outside. He was screaming profanities to NO ONE in particular at the top of his lungs. He had no phone and no blue tooth on him either. Which brings me to my next two points, don't do drugs and there will be shady idiots.. . 5. How Long Can You Wait Before You Hit Boiling Point? Again, that place is too small, that's why you will always have to suffer the long wait times. On top of it, battling the children they have for hostesses, and then to follow, the rude waitress. . . Everybody seems to be a genius when it comes to knowing the difference between good sushi and bad sushi. Unfortunately, everybody that goes to Yama, seems to have a hard time noticing the difference between good service, bad service and the obvious fact that you can go somewhere else cleaner, BIGGER, providing a much smaller wait time and still providing great sushi. Take that as a warning and a good tip, sushi lovers.. . In regards to going to Yama Sushi, if you still decide to volunteer as tribute, may the sushi forever be in your favor. Because everything else there may not be.. . Good luck!
I always enjoy my time at Yama. The sushi is always delicious to me, it doesn't taste frozen or dry or chewy. The soft shell crab is now a favorite and I get it every time I visit. The price is good, the service isn't always good but the food keeps it's stars :)
This is my favorite place to hve sushi . There oh Harry Roll is my favorite and over all it's not expensive if u get all you can eat
Such a long wait! Every time my group asked the host how much longer, the host would go around the question & never gave a straight forward answer. She led us on & should have have told us our table would take longer than expected.. . Besides that, the fish was fresh & the sushi was so good. Since its an AYCE spot, they have a lot of rules (must finish all your food, no sharing, etc. otherwise they will charge) but that's expected.. . Our server wasn't fluent in English, but she was patient & helped us get around the "rules". Kudos to her.
Have been here a handful of times and finally decided to write a review.  During previous visits, service has always been spot on.  On my most recent visit, however, the service wasn't the same.  The place wasn't terribly busy, but for some reason, our sushi orders weren't coming out as quickly as they had during previous visits.  The food is great, though.  It's a fairly small place located in a strip mall, so if you happen to show up during the lunch or dinner rush, be patient.  Despite the less than stellar service we received during our most recent visit, you can bet I'll be back for more.  Can't beat the price for an all-you-can-eat sushi bar!
This is the hidden jewel in Vegas. The diamond in the rough. A lot of out of towner's don't know about Yama because it's off the Strip. Don't waste your money at any other sushi spot in Vegas. Eat at Yama once, and you'll never wanna eat at another sushi spot again! $25 for all you can eat, tons of choices, great staff. All your typical appetizers, all your typical rolls, sushi, and sashimi. But what puts Yama above all the others are their special rolls! Many tasty selections to choose from. You can order by the half or full roll, and most of the rolls can be rolled into the seaweed cones by request (Son of the Beach hand roll!!!). . . Hands down, Yama is the best sushi spot in all of Vegas. Don't go anywhere else to satisfy your sushi fix. You'll regret it!!!
In a strip mall so look for it! I love this place. Great all you can eat specials! Amazing sushi! My favorite is the Wet Dream. Staff is friendly, too.
i went here because of the great reviews & all my friends keep talking about this place, saying it's the best ayce sushi joint in Vegas. & how people wait a few hours here cause it's so worth it. When we arrived there, we only waited 5mins max. Maybe i was expecting a lot, but it doesnt even compare to CA ayce sushi joints. I thought the rolls were sloppy, too much rice. the nigiri fish to rice ratio was way off. & the fish didnt look too fresh either.. . PROS =. - waiter was nice & cool and only charged us a few bucks to, to-go some leftovers. - seafood salad. - seaweed salad. - fried green mussels. - this one roll with spicy crab ontop. they do have a large selection for rolls, hand rolls & appetizers. But, it's just decent. If i lived in Vegas, Maybeee i'll come back again. But as an out of towner, I would never come back to eat here again.
Just got back from Vegas. Was told about this place did not believe it until tried it for myself. What a  unbelievable experience!!!!' .  OMG!!! Going back in March to Vegas that will be our  first  stop from the airport.
I love this place. I have been here well over 20 times and it never gets old
