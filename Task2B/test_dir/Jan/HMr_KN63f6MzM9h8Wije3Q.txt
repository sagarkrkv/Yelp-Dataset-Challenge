The one star is generous. . This poor poor excuse of a "resort". How dare you charge me a resort fee for wifi and other amenities when the internet NEVER worked, no coffee maker in the room, cable tv would digitize the picture to the point of making it unwatchable, and the rooms don't have a mini fridge. . Sat at a slot machine for 40 minutes and never saw a cocktail waitress. I had to get up and pay for a luke warm Corona. . Bartenders walked by us 3 times before we got up and left the bar. . Wallpaper was peeling off our hotel room wall.. In the sports book, the chair I was sitting in looked like it had been chewed on by a dog. The stuffing was coming out of it. . The players club perks are a joke. After gambling over 2000.00 we only earned 2.50 in resort credits!!! Man is that a perk or what?? This place stunk!!! Too many other places to stay in vegas that are much nicer and just a bit pricier.
Cheap place to gamble. . Great Bathrooms. . Cheap Drinks. . . They have a little mini New York with all sorts of restaurants and shops. . Indoor Roller Coaster. . . They got alot of things going on for them.
We were in NY NY for dinner, and passed thru the casino.  Guess I am not a fan of the city, and this is modeled after that ... so ... meh.
This is my favorite place to stay when in Vegas. You never have to leave the hotel because everything is in this one! Lots to do in this hotel.
I've stayed at nearly all of the MGM properties in Las Vegas, and you really can't go wrong with New York-New York.. . While it lacks the style of Aria or the sophistication of The Bellagio, it's a totally acceptable place to stay. Note, they're undergoing renovation as of January 2014.. . If you're an M-Life member you automatically get 20% off room rates, so it doesn't hurt to sign up.. . Tons of free parking in the adjoining garage, and it was good to see bicycled security patrolling the lot.. . I got a Park Avenue room for cheap. It had a desk with a LAN and wireless connection ("free" with your $20 per day resort fee). Showers are a little narrow and the tubs are quite high so be sure you don't bang your knees. Everything else is clean, comfortable, standard.. . I had a late check-out (3pm) tacked on for $20 and they were fine accommodating another 30 minutes after.. . I did note that NY-NY seems less busy that then other South Strip properties. On the flip side, there were more kids here, probably because of the roller coaster and arcade.. . Didn't eat here but other patrons seemed to enjoy Il Fornaio quite a bit. Always seemed to be a fun packed crowd at the Bar at Times Square.. . I've stayed at Mandalay and Luxor plenty of times, but sometimes get tired of tramming it. NY-NY offers a central, clean spot on The Strip.
We did not stay here, only gambled and hung out. We decided to check it out because we heard they had $5 minimum black jack tables all night. Well they do, but they only have two so good luck trying to actually play at one of them. We ended up at a $10 minimum roulette table and had a great time. My husband played and I watched, we were there for maybe 30 minutes and were offered one drink, the service seemed slow. We then headed to the little pizza place right by Coyote Ugly, I can't remember the name but it was delicious! It was actually better then pizza I had in New York City! We then headed into Coyote Ugly, we got a "special pass" so in before 9 you get free admission all night and 2 for 1 drinks till 9. We then headed back out to the casino for another hour or so, and then got to cut the line to head back into Coyote Ugly. Overall we had a great time here, the casino and bars are a really good time!
This is my husband and I favorite casino!!! :) Loved the music, big chills, and slot machines:)
Stayed here for my Vegas vacation in January. It's a nice resort, Kid-friendly even though I had no kids. Got a room that faced the roller coaster, which was kinda annoying when you're in your room and you hear people screaming, but I wasn't sleeping in the room when the roller coaster was running so no compliants. Booked through Expedia, got a room up high for about 440 for 4 nights, not bad. I think I paid at least 3 times more the last time I stayed in Vegas.
This hotel is blehhh.. It's pretty standard Las Vegas strip action. Minus one star for the AOL circa 1995 speed internet and another for the high price for the weekend. The beds weren't awful though and the customer service was okay. The next time i'm in Las Vegas i'd rather spend a little more money to stay at a far nicer place (:cough: Cosmo).
Compared to what is available now (Cosmo, Aria, Palazzo, etc), New York New York is probably two steps behind but it still keeps a bit of old school charm which I enjoyed. A large casino with a nice central bar in the middle, a good selection of food choices that aren't too spread out (I enjoyed the 24 hr diner) and of course the old school roller coaster and Statue of Liberty. The rooms were actually nice, all though a tad on the smaller side. Our strip view didn't look out into much. Overall a good middle tier Vegas hotel.
Decent service but they kind suck about timeliness will take About 20-30 minutes to get one drink!!!!! Fun environment with good energy! Good places to grab dinner or a drink... But would prefer all participates to get a few drinks before coming to this casino it's not the best definitely needs some improvement! I dunno who to say other than it's not up to my par there add plenty more things about New York. New York' lol.. I love here I know what's up you shouldn't have to pay to get into any club! Zumanity is the greatest show on the strip and the best cirque!
I didn't Stay at New York, New York during my  Vegas Trip but I wished I had.  Looks very nice all around and quite a few attractions in the Hotel itself.  A good variety of restaurants inside, from high priced to some of the dirt cheap awesome deals t hat were the best on the strip.  No lower-priced machines on the premises that we could find, which was kind of odd considering the demographic of their patrons, but what can you do.  I intend to stay here on my next trip to Sin City.
Not a bad place but from a hospitality standpoint the customer service is horrible. Of course your in Vegas its fun and there is a lot going on but as far as the actual hotel forget about it. Most employees I came in contact with could not be bothered. The houseman was the star of the team here. I arrived at 5 am, among other things the hotel doesn't even have earplugs for guests. Although i loved the Jacuzzi in the suite. A friend stayed at some motel across the street where the manager greeted us in the parking lot and was so welcoming I almost wanted to stay there.
During my recent stay here, I checked in really late (about 3 AM) and got stuck with an accessible room because we wanted a king bed. For those who don't know, accessible rooms are generally for disabled persons. This meant that the bathrooms had railings, there was no bathtub in the restroom -- just a shower, the shower has a foldable seat, and the shower floor is level with the rest of the bathroom floor. This spelled disaster when I tried to shower. . . First, the shower head was in the middle, so it faced the middle of the bathroom. I think they should have had it on the side, but I understand that most people who would stay in these rooms would just take the shower head off its hook. Second, the bathroom floor flooded because the entire bathroom floor was level. We ended up having to switch out of that room into a regular room.. . Now, all is fine, right? Well, it would have been if we hadn't been missing a few things in the room. Both the tv remote and do not disturb signs were not there. Minor problems for some, but very important for us since we knew we'd be sleeping late and didn't want housekeeping to disturb us, and the remote is obvious. . . While we had some problems with our rooms, there are many things about NY NY that are good. We enjoyed the roller coaster (although my husband said it was a little slow). The location is good, and parking was quite easy to find most of the time. Service for the most part was good minus a blip during checkout when the guy told me I had more Freeplay than what the Players Club gave me. And this time, I stayed high enough that I didn't hear the roller coaster from our room. It's not the best hotel on the Strip, but for the price and its amenities, it's not that bad.
This was my first time here so there will be more pros than cons: . . PROS: . - outside of the hotel is very appealing to look at. - casino floor is a decent size . - staff at the counter are really nice and are glad to answer any questions you may have . - very clear on how to get to your room (which elevators to take etc) . - rooms are a good size (depending on which room you get) . - decent views from each room (my view was a view of the airport, MGM grand, roller coaster) . - housekeeping is very nice and will clean your room on demand . - room on the 25th floor = nice . . CONS: . - casino is a bit on the small side. - can get crowded on the weekends . - not many selection of game tables (MGM has more) . - room was very stuffy when we walked in . - dim bathroom lighting . . Overall a good experience and would stay here again
