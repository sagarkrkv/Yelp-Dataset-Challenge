Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #2 - #365. . . Recently I just stayed at the infamous, (Caesar's Palace) where the Hangover was supposedly filmed but really it was filmed in a studio. It was a family Christmas vacay trip, so there was no hardcore partying or craziness going on. Just some R & R with the whole family, since I hardly see most of them. . . During this trip, the Vegas strip was so damn crowded, I even felt claustrophobic when I was walking around the Caesar's casino and around the strip. . . It was that crowded! . . My Mom received a comp room at Caesar's Palace, so I thought it wouldnt be so bad as long at the room was clean and safe. We were given a room in the Roman Tower (Built in the 1966), it ended up being ok, not as modern as other renovated rooms. The mattress was lumpy, there was some wear and tear on the furniture, the bathroom was outdated but doable. . . What frustrated us, was the not so complimentary WiFi that was included with the resort fee. It turns out, there was only one device available per 24 hour period for wifi use. In this case, I have the option of using my laptop or smart phone for wifi, plus it was super slow. The Cosmopolitan allows it's guests to use an unlimited amount of devices and the speed was excellent. . . All in all, the staff was friendly, they have lots of restaurant options, forum shops is just a few feet away, and it's on the center strip where most of the action is.
Home of the Movie Hangover. Very Classy very clean. I don't really have alot of complaints from this place. Kind of pricey to gamble at. . Free drinks if you gamble. $8 for those same drinks if you don't. They are very small plastic cups though so kind of a bummer. . Hangout at the pleasure pit to see the beautiful girls. . Hangout at the sports area to watch your favorite game and place bets. Big area but they have way too much seating reserved for their heavy betters. . Still like this place though.
Stayed at the Nobu Tower. We were on the 79th floor & were promised "a room with a view". The room had a view to the rooms across the tower but still beautiful nonetheless. Loved the shopping, dining, and staff. We practically stayed at the Caesars our entire trip, except when we wanted to walk the strip a bit or watch the O show which was in the neighboring hotel - Bellagio. We would most definitely stay at the Caesars again, including the Nobu Tower.
I had a surprisingly good stay here.  The room I got was very nice, affordable and a sick view of the fountain at the Bellagio.  I ordered room service a few times and it was generally good.  Room was spacious and clean. I'd like to give a special call out to Zandra Jackson at the front desk, who did a great job of helping me get a good room, welcome me to the property, etc.  Definitely would go back.
Hosted a group for a birthday celebration and working with the VIP service of Caesars could not have been easier.  In total, 20 attendees.  . . Great accommodations.  Wonderful casino.  Overall a BIG success.  Thanks Caesars!
I've stayed several times here at Caesars and have mixed feelings about this place. Obviously good feelings prevail because I keep coming back! The downside is that this hotel and casino is so large. I mean you really have to keep your time if you have to meet up with someone or have reservations anywhere. I do enjoy the gaming as an upside, the upgraded rooms I seem to get at check in, and the fact that everything is under one roof with a bonus shopping area attached. I think that's why I'm a sucker for this place.. . 2 visits back, I was coming in from the Grand Canyon and the room we had was not ready. We were sent to a room that had empty food takeaway boxes and empty juice bottles. Once we called down to the desk, they were quick to send us to a better and much larger room. I can't complain on how they handled the situation. I love the spa here Qua. The products offered in the rooms are no other from my favorite spa ;) this is home away from home.
One of my absolute favorite places to go late night shopping!! It's true that most businesses are a bit more high end and I can't afford them..but most places are buzzing with customers! . . It is a fantastic place to chill, shop, and munch on huge, fattening desserts at Max Brenner= my place to get sugar high and chocolate wasted!!!
This hotel is one of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed in! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because they don't let you plug in any video game counsels. The tv has a place where you can plug it in but the input buttons are gone on purpose! So I called the front desk and they said oh sorry, we don't allow anyone to plug anything in our tvs. I bet the only reason is that you can't do that is because they want you to go out to that casino and waste your money! But over All, this hotel is amazing!!
I've stayed here many times and enjoyed it.. Great restaurants (forum shops included).  This time we were forced into the forum tower and  it's terrible. We 're here for a conference for 8 days and the accommodations are horrible. Stained Rugs, smokey rooms, outdated. Not worth the money.  Back to the Venetian next time. Too bad ... I used to be a big Ceasar's fan.
** WORST EXPERIENCE EVER... like E-V-E-R !. . Went to a little Mexican eatery at Caesars Palace.  My husband almost ate a rusty industrial staple, that was in his black beans.  My husband bit into it and his face dropped when he pulled it out and identified it as a large industrial staple.  I quickly went and spoke to an employee of the eatery- telling them what was found.  They told me to wait at the table for the proper people to arrive (to record the incident).  My husband wanted to leave right then and go to the ER to get a tetanus shot.  I was upset/shocked and wanted to speak to someone... 45 MINUTES LATER... I start really looking around.. and noticing something strange.  There are three men around us... sitting at tables alone.. AND THEN I REALIZE THEY ARE FILMING US!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THEY ACTUALLY were sitting there for the past- who knows how long FILMING US with their camera phones.....  I WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I said to one of the men YOU GET ME SOMEONE NOW!!  All three men scattered like cockroaches.  Within 2 mins someone was there to take a report.  I said why were there men video taping us for the last 45 mins?!?!  The man said he didn't know- it was part of security...  What a terrible experience.  Horrible.. Ruined our trip.. left the next day since my husband was sure he was going to get some infection from the rusty staple.. he promptly got his tetanus shot.
The comedy "The Hangover" has had such an effect on Caesars Palace's image in the public eye in recent years that they've started to produce merchandise that basically play on Alan's quote on whether or not "Caesar lived here." When I saw said merchandise last weekend in the Forum shops (i.e.: the mall at Caesars Palace), admitting that they "get that a lot," I actually chuckled. The marketing for the resort is basically packaged nicely for the next decade for them.. . Caesars Palace (for those who noticed, it's without the apostrophe) is one of the largest hotel/resorts in the United States, if not THE largest (or constantly vying for it at least, depending on what your parameters are). Supposedly, the name of the resort doesn't contain the apostrophe because it's meant to be plural and inclusive (i.e.: this "Palace" is not exclusive to [Julius] Caesar, but to all who spend time and money here; i.e.: other "Caesars" like you, the patron (or "patrician," if you'd like)). . . Its theme is Ancient Rome during the imperial era. The architecture is monumental and imitates the former grandeur of the Roman Empire. The Forum mall is actually aptly named and was the first mall that was enclosed, but made you feel like you were outside Ancient Rome (complete with atmospheric changes that cycle through periodically). Even now, it's among the top five most successful shopping malls in America. I remember when I was a child being very impressed with the Forum mall, and quite honestly, I still enjoy walking through here whenever I'm visiting Las Vegas. If only more malls could find a theme like that and stick with it consistently throughout the facility.. . If you enter the Forum mall through Las Vegas Boulevard, you'll likely see the spiraling escalators. They're one of only a handful in the world, and if you don't know where the rest are, it doesn't matter. This is by far the most impressive presentation of it. Nearby, there's also those talking statues of the Gods of the Festival. If you haven't seen a presentation yet, you'll need to, just to be able to say you did. Though it's a bit cheesy now, it was pretty impressive to a small child when it first debuted many, many years ago (i.e.: me).. . As of this writing, Celine Dion is currently the house act here at the Coliseum (again, aptly named for the performing art center at Caesars), and apparently, she's one of the biggest shows in Las Vegas. I haven't seen her show yet, though I did like that Titanic theme she sang back in 1997 for film. Reason enough to see an act, I suppose.. . I only noticed ONE person who actually got into the Ancient Rome theme this weekend and wore a Roman toga. He could have been part of a stag or bachelor's party or whatnot, but that got me thinking that Caesars should promote more of their patrons and some staff members to don period attire if they got 'em. Roman Empire, cosplay and history buffs would probably get off on such a sight.. . Just like the hotel itself, I think it's a monumental task to describe all the elements of the resort in one review. You really should just take a moment to browse the pictures here on Yelp to get an idea of the kinds of things you'll see at Caesars Palace if you've never been inside before. There's just way too much detail in the events, rooms, casino, retail, restaurants, clubs, etc. to accurately describe and stay under the character limit.. . On a personal note, I have to mention that back in the summer of 2003 or 2004, I recall coming across Chris "Jesus" Ferguson (the poker player) at the Pure nightclub here at Caesars while on a weekend trip with some college friends. I took a picture with him outside in the patio area and still have that picture here at my desk as I'm writing this review. I honestly, have never had any bad experiences with Caesars, and it seems that, despite not actually having stayed a night here, I find myself visiting the Palace basically every time I'm around town.. . Hail Caesar!
I always love coming to Caesars Palace. Even whenI was kid (especially after watching Rain Man) I always enjoyed CP. They've done a good job at staying relevant as Vegas has aged. Great upkeep of the facility, and a knack for thoughtful marketing.
On top of the rate they quote you, you will have to pay city resort tax and sales tax but then they surprise you with a 28 Dollar phone and Gym tax whether you want to use their services or not. The room I have for $200 night has no view
Caesars Palace is always my choice when staying in Las Vegas.  I go about 4 or 5 times a year and never stay anywhere else.  The VIP staff and casino hosts are always very professional and attend to my every need.  Not once have I had a problem with checking in or checking out.  My preference is either the Palace tower or the new Octavious tower.  My room is always clean and ready.  The housekeeping staff is excellent and say good morning everyday which is refreshing.  If you don't have a great experience you only need to ask to speak to a manager or host and they will take care of you.  The resort is very easy to get around and the signage on the property is very adequate.  I almost never leave Caesars while staying.  Everything you want is there.  During the warm months enjoying the pool is a great experience also.  One thing I noticed last spring and summer was that they could of used more servers around the pool.  They were very busy and can't possibly make everyone happy.  That is my one and only complaint.
A bustling center of commerce, fun, and food, Caesars Palace is one of the best casino resorts in town. Even though it is and old establishement, management has not let it deteriorate much like other places on the strip. Clean and tidy floors, good looking statues, and an overall peaceful ambiance are how I would characterize this place.. . The casino has a really open feel and although it is pretty busy, there is still a high ceiling and a sense of room to breath. The drinks were refreshing and the mall was a very nice experience. Hope to stay here next time!
Terrible billing experience.  After a wonderful stay and show with Shania Twain, the front desk changed the rate on my hotel stay at checkout.  The desk left me to wait 45+ minutes while they contacted their billing department to straighten it out.  They then said I owed 200 more for a two night stay.  I tried to give them the info from my confirmation regarding rate on my package and the manager was only interested in getting me to go away as I was agitated after waiting 45 + minutes to get them to sort everything out.  The manger (anthony Pyne) then went on to complain to me that sorting out my account would take up the rest of his day but he would give me a call before charging anything to my card as I refused to sign anything.  Lo and behold my card has been charged and no call from them.  Apalled at customer service manager attitude that my "billing dispute" would waste his time for the rest of the day, wouldn't even try to go through his math with me which was obviously wrong.  Needless to say I will be submitting my confirmations to cc company and I will win since their staff obviously can't add.
Caesar Palace is one of the oldest hotel in the strip, it fact is almost 60 years old !  Despite is such old hotel, you won't notice it by the exterior or interior.  They did remarkable job keep the shape and made many improvement.  After all this is the hotel that the blockbuster movie Hangover pick not once but twice of their trilogy.. This is a massive hotel, it will me like a good ten to fifteen minutes to walk pass the entire Caesar Palace just from the street.  This hotel features the currently best buffet in town "Bacchanal".   They also added new hotel room called Nobu which a modern hotel room that isn't inspired by Roman Theme.   . . Also, forum shop the current biggest shopping outlet in the strip is also located in this hotel.  Technically, you do not need to leave the hotel for most of the act ivies, it got basically little bit of everything.  The location of the hotel is among the best in the strip, next to Bellagio and across Paris.  There is numerous water fountain spare all around the hotel both inside and out.. . The most expensive room in Vegas are happened to be in this hotel as well, costing almost 50 grand a night consist of a actual Villa with over 20,00 square feet.  So if you are super high roller or a millionaire.  There is a suite suitable for your statue.  I think their standard room rate is a bit overprice for aFour-class hotel class.  The price is about the same an Aria, which is a Five Star.  Maybe the movie Hangover and Bacchanal really jack up the price, it was not that long this hotel was a bargain since it got no resort fee, but now it does and the rate is also high.  This is a hotel you will likely going to visit many times since it got so much to offer, but as for hotel guest is hard to sell to me unless the price is right.
I was in town to get married.  I'd gambled, ate, and/or drank at Caesars Palace Hotel & Casino many times, but on this visit I finally stayed there as well since we were doing the ceremony in one of Caesars' wedding chapels and we'd secured a block of rooms in the hotel for us and our guests.  Our rooms were in the Augustus Tower, which had its own registration desk, a short walk from the main entrance, but accessible to an even more convenient side entrance off of Flamingo with a requisite cab stand.  Our standard room, non-smoking with king bed, was spacious and had a beautiful view south down the Strip overlooking the Bellagio's fountains.  The bed was comfortable, perhaps not as comfortable as the ones I've found at the Cosmopolitan, Palms, and Hard Rock, but the pillows were very nice with good support.  The bathroom was equally spacious with a glass shower, Jacuzzi tub, a large vanity with dual sinks, and a separate W/C.  The only minor critique would be the 42" flat panel TV, which seemed to only get standard definition signal.  Not a problem, though, since we spent very little time in the room.  . . As for the common areas, like the casino, they seemed much more smoke-filled than I remember from previous visits.  My clothes, skin, and hair reeked of secondhand smoke after any time spent in the casino.  There weren't that many smokers around me, but I'm guessing the air exchange/filtration system was not as efficient as the ones installed in much newer casinos like the Cosmopolitan and Aria.  Still, the gaming, drink service, and overall service from the entire Caesars property staff was very good to excellent.  Caesars Palace is a place that I'll definitely stay and play again.
Awesome hotel excellent customer service and beautiful rooms... My only complaint is that the Octavious Tower (which we were upgraded to for free) was a quarter mile from everything!
Staying at Caesars tonight and I must say the Delux sweet it nice. Big room with very very comfy beds and a nice tv. Bathroom is great compared with many others. . . Mot as good as Cosmo. But still nice. . . Rooms are daily priced. Not cheap for what you get. But it's still worth it. . . The best part is this new buchanial buffet they have which is really great. I'll post a review for the buffet soon.!! . . Thanks Caesars. Will be back.
My new favorite go-to Vegas spot.. Pros:. Location, location, location. Service is mostly great throughout the property. Pool is AMAZING. Good restaurants. Casino is huge, so lots of options for everyone. Rooms are comfortable--especially the Palace tower.. Full size Jacuzzi tub in the Palace tower! Not just a dinky tub with jets being called a hot tub. The newly improved buffet is very popular (aka crowded) but so good!!!. . Cons:. Not many! The property is HUGE so it does take a while to get around and it's very easy to get lost. Prices aren't always the best but good deals can be had, especially with Total Rewards membership . They recently started billing a resort fee, which sucks but is expected. Valet can take a really long time. Room service is eh. . Definitely a Vegas classic and great place to stay. I particularly love staying here during the summer because the pool (and the service and pricey but delicious drinks at the pool) is a lot of fun without being an exclusive party-pool atmosphere. Hail Caesar's!
