My fiance and I recently returned home from a trip to fabulous Las Vegas after stay 12/26/13-12/29/13 and staying and the FLAMINGO !! This wasn't our first trip to Las Vegas nor was it the first stay at the Flamingo. It was however the very worse stay I have ever had in any Las Vegas hotel, rude staff horrible customer service and down right horrible house keeping. Aside from all that the real topper was cockroaches the we found in our room. I'm willing to provide the exact number. 15139 and what the hotel desk manager MELINDA said. " well this is the desert, what do you expect ?"  She is a liar and by far the very worst customer service representative I've ever dealt with in 30 years and several. Need less to say they did not stay true to their word and are very very lousy at what they do. I will be following up with. MELINDA'S bosses and pushing strong for some corrective measures and proper training. Lastly $45.36 would not brake the bank for a hotel of that volume and we simply wanted 1 night room rate returned as PROMISED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY WORSE ENEMY TO STAY THERE AND WE WILL NEVER SET FOOT INTO THAT ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN.
Hazel Q nailed it when she said its an A-ok for her book.  . . I had a room on the 29th floor and the view was fantastic.  The faux hard wood floors were a nice touch, and the bed was confy.  The bathroom, however, plumeted the rating from a 4 star to a generous 3.  Its old, tiles were chipped, the clothesline was broken, the vanity light wasn't working... awful.  . . I can't complain about the price.. I was comp'd and given spending money (pays to be a Total Rewards platinum). Its MUCH better than Imperial Palace (ie: the Quad).  I think next time I'll try for the Go Deluxe rooms.
Well, took another trip to Vegas this time for the holidays. I have a list of hotels on the strip I want to stay at and this time  I decided to stay at The Flamingo. There is definitely some good and some bad. Here it is:. . First off check in. Holy Mary mother of GOD what a cluster fuck. A million friggin people all over the place, people not sure where the line begins or ends, and like 3 people working to check all these people in. And check out was no picnic but more on that later. It took a little over an hour to check in. I have been to Vegas quite a bit and I have never had this big of a fiasco at check in. I knew it might be a little busy due to the holidays but that is no excuse for the lack of staff. Especially considering that check in is at 4pm and it was almost 5pm. They should have more staff working behind the counter at such hot times to better serve the amount of customers checking in especially since it was the holidays.  I have checked in at busy times in Vegas before and have never waited that long. After dealing with the flight and the airport and check in by the time I got to my room I just wanted to relax for a bit.. . I had a good view of the strip which I appreciated. I have to say I liked the room. It was a big room. It was in the habitat area on the 19th floor. The bathroom was spacious as well. The beds were pretty comfy. They did the job. The TV worked fine. The shower was pretty good as well. The water pressure was fine and the temperature controls worked fine as well. I do have to say that the water coming out the sink, however, had a funky smell to it. I did not experience that with the shower but I did with the sink. The room safe did not work but when I called about it someone came up and promptly fixed it. That was addressed quickly which I appreciated. I ordered room service on the first night because I was hungry but too damn tired to walk around deciding what to get and that food was just ok. I ordered a seafood pasta. Nothing spectacular about it. The delivery was pretty fast and prompt. Overall, I thought the room was nice, spacious and comfortable. Great room for the price especially. . . The casino is a nice one. I always found plenty of tables to play at. For the most part the dealers were pretty friendly. One in particular stood from the rest and his name was Carlos. He made the games extra fun and he had an amazing personality to match his amazing looks. Him looking so good made it hurt less when he took my money in roulette. :-) In all seriousness though he is how a dealer should act. Fun and friendly. As far as the cocktail waitresses go I guess it depend son which one you have. Some of them would totally ignore you or not come by for hours on end while others made regular stops and were friendly to boot. That was more 50/50. Overall I enjoyed the casino and even though I explored other casinos I found myself just wanting to gamble there. . . Check out was a bitch as well. Again at the hot button time to check out not enough staff. I opted for the express check out but that still had a long ass wait and was just as big a pain in the ass. When I saw the bill upon checkout I have to say I was pretty annoyed. They will nickel and dime you to DEATH. They charge a $29 a day resort fee. I know all the hotels charge a resort fee but still I think that is a little excessive. I also got charged for housekeeping services which I am in the process of debating right now because I never asked the maid to come everyday and make my bed. They just come and I am not about to pay for that. If I would have known that I was being charged like $20 every time they come I would have opted out. I had plenty of towels and did not need my bed made everyday. The interesting thing is I have NEVER been nickle and dimed like this at another Vegas hotel This is the only time this has happened so maybe it is not as much if bargain to stay here as some might think. . . Overall I am going to have to give this place three stars.  I am not too happy with the extra charges for housekeeping. The resort fee I will let slide because I knew about that but the rest of it makes me wonder if staying here is even worth it. I may just come here to gamble again but staying at the hotel I think I will pass.
This is the worst hotel ever! Well my family paid for the cheapest room, so not quite sure how great the expensive rooms are. First off, the parking structure is HORRIBLE! So we decided to do valet.. . Anyways, We were on the 16th floor, as we walk in, our jaws dropped, literally all the way down to lobby! Everything was so old inside, the dresser was falling apart, the tub faucet was leaking, mold everywhere, drain was so.....slow! Around the sink area more.....MOLD!  The motel at Disneyland area is way better! . . Even if the room is at a medium price .. don't give customers a dirty presentation! . . Also this place gave me a phobia of elevators! My dad and I decided to get some breakfast downstairs. We entered the elevator, and got down to 3rd floor, all of a sudden the light for lobby goes out, and I was thinking to myself why it wasn't lit anymore (wehaven't even reached lobby level) and that's when chaos started, the elevator decided to do a Hollywood Terror Hotel Mode. It would literally go up really fast and bounce for the longest time until we reached the 22nd floor,and it was a relief that the elevator doors opened! Then we saw this housekeeper and told her that this elevator is malfunctioning, and all she did was stood there and said, "I know." UH OKAY?!?!? what.. NO COMPRENDE INGLES?!. . Fix your parking structure and do more improvements in your rooms and hire better housekeepers! . . Overall I will never stay here again!
I stayed at the Flamingo on a recent trip the Las Vegas. The hotel is very conveniently located at the centre of the strip which made seeing the attractions as easy as it can be in Vegas. The check in process is a bit of an ordeal at busy times as so many people want to check in at the same time there can be long queues. . . The room itself (on the 14th floor) was clean and I liked that there was no carpet in the room which gave it a modern feel. The view was of the courtyard where the flamingos live instead of the strip which I didn't mind in hindsight.. . The Flamingo casino is a bit tatty compared with those in the other hotels. There is a strange smell throughout where they struggle to suppress the scent of stale tobacco but as Caesars and the Bellagio are across the road this area can be avoided.
Get more than what you actually pay!  Great room! I would recommend!  TV in the bathroom.  Pillow top mattress.  And we paid under 50/ night!!
Omg!! This place is disgusting!.  This is my second time at the flamingo. Several years ago we came here for our first trip to Vegas, we really enjoyed it then. However, this time our experience was not the same.. .  First off..check in. What a line, that didn't seem to move. We Sat in line for about half an hour moving about ten feet. Finally we saw someone using the express check . in kiosk, we decided to give that a try. Good news, we were checked in in about ten minutes, bad news,  no one to tell you about the fact that you get two passes a day for the gym or free internet, especially since the sign in your room says it costs money!! Total bullshit.. So I picked a non smoking room on the 19th floor.. First the elevators, which where old and dingy and dirty. A couple times they stopped on odd floors, opened the doors about 5 inches and just sat there until we hit a button. Alot of beeping and squelling.. .  Our room happened to be the farthest room from the elevator which made us walk thru what had to be a smoking room area. The smell walking thru this area to get to our room was disgusting. I seriously wanted to throw up. The carpet was so old and stained and dirty. Riped in many places, and so jacked up that it was rippling down the hall. I tripped over it a number of times. Having had back surgery recently this was very hard and dangerous for me to walk on.. The main room itself was ok. Actually liked the firm bed and at first liked the faux wood laminate, however this is really annoying late at night when drunk people are stomping around, and also really hard on your feet after lots of walking.. The bathroom was horrible! Filthy old and moldy. The toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall. The bathtub was moldy around the edges with the soap holder all cracked and broken tiles. Mold on the ceiling and old broken fixtures. The cabinets had chipped old paint and were separating from the wall.  Even the cups were paper. . Overall this place made my skin crawl. I will never go back.. On a positive more, if you go to the buffet around 1030, you pay for breakfast, but they start bringing out the crab and other lunch items, but you only pay for breakfast.. . spend your money at NYNY. Rooms are super nice. Just booked here after our flight got canceled!!
Wish I could give it more but honestly I am being nice with a 2 star.  We went last minute to vegas so decided to give this hotel a shot because it had been remodeled and was a good deal.  Wish we would have spent more and stayed somewhere else.. . We were very excited when we checked in the clerk was so nice to us and upgraded us to a suite since vegas was dead because of the storm in the east.  We walked into the "suite" which was large but had not seen a remodel since the 80's i am sure.  The carpet was stained, the bathroom door had paint peeling off of it and it smelled like smoke (non-smokers). We had reserved a remodeled room and because we had show tickets we could not go back down and deal with the issue.. . The next morning we were upgraded to the room we were supposed to have and it was nicer except the bathroom had not been upgraded. The lines to talk to the front desk were super long and the staff so so.  The elevators had a ton  of trash in them every time we got in them.  To their credit there was a beer pong contest going on so maybe this is not the norm but it is what we experienced.. . I will say the beds in both rooms were very comfortable and it was a great location convenient to a lot of great restaurants and entertainment.  The refurbed room was nice with the exception of the sinks.  Maybe if our stay had started out in this room and the fire alarm had not gone off at 3 in the morning we would have felt differently.
Location is good. We were upgraded to a suite bc they ran out of regular rooms before our arrival. Only problem was it was one bed and a couch. We had 4 adults. They brought a roll away bed after we called. The suite is well worth the upgrade if an option. Got a peek at a few other rooms and they weren't nearly as nice as the suite. Only complaint is the room smelled of smoke. It was so bad we had to remove the covers. . One note, person who reserves the room must show ID to check in even if the other adults are listed. It took us a few tries to get enough keys, etc for all 4 adults on the reservation. . This is only a 3 because of the suite otherwise for the price I'd select a 2 for a regular room. . Be sure to get the Total Rewards card BEFORE you arrive. This can save hours on check in. No joke the line was insane when we left in the morning. Total Rewards has an express check in line.
Well, I knew it was a cheap hotel before I arrived but work is trying to keep budgets low. . I'll start by saying the staff is really nice. Big win for them. but.... . It has zero class, fun... anything. It's not even like it's cheap but fun. It's just horrible. . My colleagues and I did a group 'bed-bug-check' if that gives you any idea. On a positive note, we didn't find any but you shouldn't be so worried upon entering your hotel room that you feel the need to check. . . The wifi is slower than dial-up. I can't believe they charge a $20/day fee for it. I don't think $20 is bad- I think waiting 10 min for a page to load is bad. It's more cost-effective to get an increase on your data plan for the month. . . The restaurant 'Center Cut' isn't so bad.  Not quite worth the money but the staff is nice. The only decent restaurant in the joint. I guess Margaritaville wasn't so bad either.     . . Ok place to lay your head (they are on the bed bug registry so take a moment to check your mattress) but go elsewhere for...everything.. . Hope that helps.
Terrible customer services. Dirty rooms. Keys randomly deactivated so you have to trek down to main lobby every night. Customer service honestly does not cater to your needs and does not document issues within their system correctly. Buffet is not worth the value. Avoid at all cost. Hidden resort fee which puzzles everyone at checkout.. . Awful experience here. I normally don't write bad reviews but this place deserves one. Had to stay here for CES but next time, I'd rather stay off the strip then here.
I stay at the Flamingo every year. I have had regular rooms and GO Rooms. They have all been great. Upgrade to GO if you can. The place is not a palace but its clean and not too massive. You can actually get to your room without a map. . The location is right at the main 4 corners of the strip. Everything is close. The Paradise Garden Buffet has the best breakfast buffet around, I've seen Donny & Marie twice and am going again. Perfect show. . Go for it and enjoy your stay!
As anyone who reads my hotel reviews knows, I'm not super discriminating. I'm usually in Vegas for trade shows and don't spend much time in my room anyway. So, provided my hotel has easy access to whatever convention center, hot water and a comfortable bed, my complaints are typically minimal.. . I stayed at the Flamingo for 2014 CES and don't really have anything bad to say. It's on the monorail loop (two stops to the LV convention center), there's some pretty decent, if not easy and convenient dining options, lots of bars and shops, and friendly staff. . . The Total Rewards program is worth it - my rate for 4 days at the Flamingo was less than one night a hotels that were a bit closer to the CES venue, but with a huge show like that you've got to expect jacked up prices.. . The only really negative thing I'd say about this place is the hallway carpets have seen much better days - they need a steam clean, stat. Also, it didn't seem like the staff was too quick to grab room service trays and empty glasses out of the hallways. Not a deal breaker, but kind of off-putting.. . I'd definitely stay at the Flamingo again - it's reasonably priced and pretty comfortable - and that typically fits my needs in sin city. If you're looking for value, it's a great spot. If you're looking for luxury, this probably isn't the place for you.
Very very poor customer service, smelly, dirty hallways, the saddest lunch buffet I have ever seen and the worst eggs Benedict I have ever eaten. (or not eaten) was what I experienced during my last stay on my birthday. Booked a special visa card promotion and then was lied to by the front desk agent. Never received my visa card promotion, got a business card from the "hotel operations manager" only to have the number on the card ring into oblivion, not even an answering machine....SAD!. I have been staying at the Flamingo for over 15 years and I will think twice next time. They have really gone downhill with uncaring customer service, really really dirty hotel and rooms etc. No wonder they send me more promotions now than when I was a diamond member for over 7 years. With this kind of service and many many other options in Vegas, I hope they see how bad they are getting and make a change for the good...
Great location reasonably priced including clean comfortable beds. What more do you need!
First time here.. no customer service at all checking in and out. They are so rude. . Room was very dusty and old. You have to pay for wireless Internet.  I wouldn't recommend this place.
I decided to stay here for a wedding in vegas. I booked a deluxe room and got upgraded on arrival to a premium new room. The room was very nice. Two beds, two tv"s one in the bathroom.  The place was clean  and new. Had a refrigerator and ipod hookups. I would stay here again. The only thing I disliked is the 10$ fee to get in the sauna.  I think resort fee should cover that, the sauna was a little outdated not worth the extra $ but staff in the other hand was  awesome!! I will come bk to this hotel
Me and four girlfriend stayed here during our first trip to Vegas. We had a great time. We stayed from Saturday-Tuesday in a GO deluxe room. I would recommend one of these rooms, as they are spacious and very nice. We got ours for the same price as the regular rooms through Expedia.. . Honestly, there was nothing bad about this place because we weren't here to spend our time in the hotel room. Our experience, however, was totally fine and even (by my picky standards) good: The rooms were clean and spacious, the air worked well, and the bathroom was clean. . . We arrived in Vegas around 10 a.m. and checked in early. We couldn't get into the room until 3 p.m. or so. They let us check our luggage in some back room and gave us 4 passes the pool. We changed in the bathroom on the lobby floor and went out the pool. They only gave us 4 passes since it was technically a 4 person room, but we had no trouble bringing an extra person in. They only check IDs--they don't even check the passes. We bought drinks (expensive, but we expected that) and lounged all day. It was great!. . We didn't experience any poor customer service and we didn't have any complaints. The location was perfect. We went to clubs at the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio and they were very close. . . The best part about this place was the adult pool. SO fun. Honestly, that made the trip. A lot of club promoters were at the pool, and they were walking around and putting people on lists. DO THIS! You will gain express entry and even free cover. This was amazing and totally made our trip worth it!. . This place is cheap and in an amazing location. I removed one star for our view: construction and a crappy part of town south of the Strip as well as the strange leaking that was occurring all over the hallway from the floor above us. Otherwise, the experience was great and it was exactly what I expected in Vegas: gaudy and over the top.
Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.
I had a great time in Vegas until I woke up with bites on my thighs and legs.... I saw these little black bugs in my bed. I told the manager and she didn't even care, I was treated like a suspect of sorts. She send someone up to do a "claim" and that was the last I heard from them. I payed for my room, and headed straight to the nearest doctors office. Had to get all kinds of antibiotics and creams because I had an allergic reaction to the bites so life was not good for a while. I love Las Vegas, but honestly that just is not a good example of a sanitary environment, good management, or good service. I gave one star because I won 300 dollars in the roulette table.
Yikes!  I will start with what was good (since it will not take too long).  The price was quite reasonable (I booked a Black Friday special on the Flamingo website).  The location is great!  The grounds are nice, with a wildlife refuge complete with birds, koi ponds and more.  We got to the hotel a couple of hours before the 4 PM check in.  We were allowed to check in early (for a $15.00 fee)... Our room had a fabulous view of the new Ferris wheel and the animal refuge.  And the room is nicely updated.  Sadly, the bathroom had rusty drains and BUGS (ants?) in the shower.  Yuck.  The hallways were DISGUSTING!  Carpet was dirty and in desperate need of a stretching.  It is a trip hazard!  Tears and huge waves of wrinkles.  Also, be wary of anything promised to you before your arrival.  We called to request a fridge (they were able to deliver on this) and a coffee pot.  Due to a special diet, I need hot water.  We called before our trip to request this.  Once there we were told we had to be in the "Gold Tower" (at an additional charge) in order to have a coffee pot.  Since we drove, I would have brought my own but did not as we were assured we could have one.  I was on at least 2 (Habitat) elevators that did not work.  As for the casino, on three occasions we were at slots for 30 + minutes and NEVER had drink service.  The "free" parking is great if you can find a spot.  The first day we were fine.  The second day (after returning from a hike) the parking garage AND the Valet were both full.  On our last morning, we (reluctantly) went to one of the hotel restaurants for breakfast.  Again, dirty carpet (yuck...in a restaurant I'd like to see some cleanliness).  I ordered the french toast (quite a treat for me as I usually do not eat this).  It looked lovely!  Lots of fresh berries, three thick slices of french toast.  I poured a little syrup on one piece.  Had a few bites, poured more syrup on and YUCK!!!!  an empty wrapper from  sweetener poured onto my toast.  It took about 8-10 minutes to find our waitress.  Another 8-10 to get a new plate (delivered with attitude) and this plate had very few berries...of course my husband was long finished with his meal.  This is not a hotel I would stay at again.  There are much better choices in Vegas
I love the Flamingo.  It's my absolute favorite hotel to stay at on the strip.  It's close, it's cheap, they generally take care of everything.  This time was not the case.  . . We came into to town for work and to visit friends and compete in a weekend long tournament plus a couple days and here is how it went down.. . .  check-in 1. 1.  Check-in from the diamond lounge, service is stellar as usual. 2.  Get to our room and it is a standard king sized room. 3.  About 5pm we realize we're situated over carnival court can hear EVERYTHING. 4.  Our neighbors check in and clearly plan to rage in their room. Awesome.. 5.  I go to shower and find myself standing shin high in grey water (tub won't drain). 6.  I am greeted on my towel by a cockroach...this has never happened before  . . Check-In 2 go to diamond office and change rooms. . 1.  All is well at check-in again. 2.  We move rooms. 3.  Our new room over looks the high roller (cool). 4.  Towards the evening hours we realize our neighbors have a dog.      - dog whines, barks, yelps for hours after being left alone. 5.  We come back to the room after a long day of competition and dog is still upset . 6.  At 4am....our TV turns on blaring to the menu screen.      -the remote control doesn't turn it off and pushing power on the tv itself doesn't turn it off so we end up just unplugging it. 7.  The lamps in the room are either broken or have some sort of short, once you turn the, on, they don't stay on. . Day 3. 1.  Elevator 1 doors will not close . 2.  Try to take a bath after another long day at competition and THIS TUB won't hold its water.  Ironic.  . 3.  After everything else we just give up.  . . By day 4, doggy couple checked out, reasonable neighbors checked in and we spent the remainder of our trip on the casino floor.  . . Side note to housekeeping:  is it really necessary to slam the vacuum against the walls???  And two...why when we have a do not disturb card out do we get woken up at 9am to make sure we're checking out???. . . Not my favorite stay here....but it could've been worse.  I could've stayed off strip.
I've stayed at Flamingo twice now and now that I'm no longer a broke college student, I won't be returning! . . Flamingo may have a great location to be in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd, but this place still lacks a lot. Although they've been through vigorous renovations, the ice machines weren't working at all on my first visit in July 2013; this includes the floor I was staying on, the floor above, and the floor below.. . My visit in December 2013 was also less than pleasant. The water was straight up cold my entire shower and the water was also not draining which left for a freezing and unhappy Courtney. . . Flamingo also lacks outlet plugs in their rooms - bring your own extension cords because all the outlets seem to be in the most inconvenient spots ever!
I'm not sure what all the complaints are about... If you want Luxury, go across the road, pay double and stay at Caesars! If you want a good room at a decent room price, in a clean casino, with an awesome location, stay here. Yes, the hallway carpets and elevators could use an update (hence the 4 stars). Yes, the bathrooms weren't renovated when the rooms were, but it's not the end of the world! We stayed in a Fab Deluxe room with a Strip View. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean. We didn't spend a lot if time in there.... It's Vegas. The location is here is key! You are in walking distance to great shopping, dining and nightlife. There's a monorail station at the hotel. Was this casino as fancy or impressive as Planet Hollywood or Paris? No!!!! But, it didn't really matter to us since we could just walk to them....
Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!
After looking for the best deal, and most conveniently located hotel, that was somewhat affordable in Las Vegas during CES, Dan and I settled (and SETTLED we did), for the Flamingo Hotel. Within walking distance of the Venetian, where we could visit many of the exhibitors, and easily catch a shuttle to the Convention Center, the Flamingo Hotel turned out to be the SECOND MOST DISGUSTING PLACE in which we have ever stayed. Rooms at this hovel (not a typo) range from 35.00 in the low season to 289.00 for rip off season. They have a lot of nerve.Arriving at midnight after a LONG ASS day of flying due to a snow storm in our layover city, Chicago, all we wanted was a quick bite and a comfy bed, on which to rest our pretty heads. Sadly, the line to check in, had at least 20 people in front of us. We waited patiently, knowing that would happen very soon. We checked in, then walked through the smoky filled casino to the FOOD COURT to grab a bite.. We waited on line to order a burger and salad, at Johnny Rocket's. seconds, I finally go to order my long awaited tuna salad, at 12:00 midnight and 3 seconds. "We don't serve tuna after midnight". I perused the menu, and SETTLED on a turkey burger. "We don't serve turkey burgers after midnight", said the fellow at the cash register.. "Are you kidding me?", I asked. He wasn't."We serve burgers or eggs", the young man told me.. Dan ordered his burger and I sauntered over to the other seemingly healthy food option, a Chinese Chicken Salad from L.A. salad and wraps.. Suffice it to say, the CHICKEN that was on top of this lettuce, green onion, fried chinese noodle mix, was not EXACTLY chicken. It was other worldly. I think maybe it was chicken roll or something else fashioned into a flat cutlet type thing.. We guzzled the food, and couldn't wait to get upstairs, proving that when I'm hungry I will eat anything.. Arrving on the 8th floor, it was clear that they place was a well worn. The halls weren't all that clean. I take that back. They were gross. There were rips in the carpet, along with gum smooshed into it. The doors were all dirty too. I chalked it up to old age, and was a little forgiving, but still not happy.. The room came with a view (this was NOT it), and all the loud sounds that come, an entire city block of construction. Right outside my window! The room, with its ancient furniture, wasn't HORRIBLE.. The roach crawling on the wall, on the other hand was.The bathroom was replete with toothpaste. Oh, not toothpaste to use with my toothbrush.. This toothpaste, was in the air conditioning grates....Perhaps the maid missed it...All five days, that we stayed there.. She also missed the q-tip that was stuck in between the missing tiles. Well, they weren't missing, they were just behind the toilet. She did miss the giant hair that was stuck to the ceiling also.. None of this was nearly as nauseating as the 2 inches of dust, that was living in the bathroom lighting fixtures. Let's just say the place is a little run down. Understatement.. The toilet was also DISGUSTING. ALL FIVE DAYS.. After checking for bedbugs, assuming that the housekeeping staff, would make sure that the room was really clean the next day, we HAD TO GO TO sleep. It was already after 1:30AM, and I was in no mindset, to call to bitch and moan. Did I just say that? We had to be up and out by 8:00AM, and I needed some rest.. I woke up with a stiff neck from using pillows that ranged from 6-8 inches high. Right before we left in the morning, I called housekeeping and asked for one, only one, DECENT pillow, explaining that these were all too rubbery and hard and I couldn't afford to work CES with a neck ache. She said, "Sure thing. No problem.". Later that night ( it was actually the next morning at around 1:30), we arrived back to the room after a LONG day of press events and parties, ready for sleep. The beds had been made, the garbage disposed of, towel folded, and sink cleaned. The toothpaste, dust, broken tiles and q-tip all remained untouched. Doesn't the housekeeping staff get trained in CLEANING?In addition, as far as I could tell, there was no pillow replacement. They all ranged from 6-8 inches high, and impossible for me to use. I slept without one.The next morning, with another crick in my neck, I called to ask about the pillows. This time the answer was, "Those are the ONLY pillows that we have. They are all the same. The housekeeper brought you a new one". I scratched my head. We spied these two pillows on the floor....yes I said, "on the floor", in front of another guest's room. They were there for at least 8 hours. Clearly I am not the only one, that doesn't like sleeping on HARD RUBBER. But I digress.
OMG!...where the hell are all these negative reviews coming from???.... . .I LOVE THE FLAMINGO!...cause maybe i'm one of those LUCKY ONES who got an upgraded room with a view upon arrival (a GO DELUXE ROOM)...and in the RENOVATED SECTION of the hotel.... that I booked at a GREAT PRICE through the TOTAL REWARDS PROGRAM that ANYONEcan join!!.... . I arrived on a SATURDAY evening...at around check-in time expecting a long-ass line...and yup!...there was a hella LONG line....but not for those who have a TOTAL REWARDS card....NO LINE!...wtf...lucky AGAIN!. .

Had an ok stay recently. Noticed the carpet in the halls of the hotel are filthy. Price is right since its on the strip-the resort fees are ridiculous. The bathroom is small-could be cleaner, water pressure in shower was great. A few mildew spots in shower need to be bleached out. Beds are comfy, sheets were clean and had a GREAT view of the garden area.
Stayed here last night and I must say they have some nice new rooms for the flamingo. . . The fab Delux rooms are great. Nice bathrooms and nice beds with amazing blackout sheets to cover your windows. . . Room service along with upgraded bathroom tools make it so much better. . . For $30 can't beat that. I will be back flamingo. I even made a players card.
AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! . . We "upgraded" to the newer rooms and had a nice view, but the black film over the windows pretty much ruins it. We had the room RIGHT outside the elevator shaft. We could.NOT.sleep. It was so loud and rickety. It sounded like we were sleeping on the coaster at NYNY. We asked if there was any way we can change rooms and they were SO RUDE. Said we could not change after check in time was over. (But we were at the World Furniture Market all day and couldn't have switched before. We got NO SLEEP that night.. . Next morning......ANTS. ALL OVER! (Will be posting pictures) Ants covering the bathroom floor. It was absolutely terrifying. Again, no one we talked to cared and acted like it was a normal thing. I'm not talking like three little ants on their way. I counted over 50 while I was sitting there trying to pee. YUCK! Plus the bathroom vanities are MINI. I couldn't even set all my stuff by the sink. . . . Terrible service, Yucky rooms. The halls are also dirty. PLEASE DON'T STAY HERE!
