Connecting thru PHX on the way to ANC. PHX is pretty efficient at moving you thru. I Like the upgraded water fountains that allow the easy fill of water bottles. Not too thrilled with the removal of a lot of the Starbucks and replacing with "local" coffee bars. Some of them aren't that good. pHX could use most electronic device charging stations. For a big airport, it's pretty decent.
Terrible airline operations, incompetent TSA.  You're better off flying in to ABQ and driving.
Jenni at the Southwest airlines helping my daughter and I check was fast(which I like) and very helpful. The guy checking us in at gate 11 not friendly and not very helpful.
Dude, you're so freaking humid. . . I know that my review won't change anything about this place, but pump some A/C into your vents! I swear the both times I came here, in two separate seasons, the level of humidity is too damn high! And I don't understand why the amenities and restaurants are available before going through security. . . . . If anything, +1 for free wifi that's actually pretty fast.
Third time a charm?. . Nope. . . Add 35 minutes to return car to a facility that is located in the next county. . . Half the restaurants are closed, its noon. . . Waiting areas can maybe seat half the people waiting to depart. . . Impossibly hot, winter or summer. . . Sky Harbor continues to disappoint and remains a bottom tier airport. Avoid if you can.
The signage at the airport was poor if you do a cross terminal.  In addition, I met the rudest TSA agent I have ever dealt with when asking about which terminal American Airlines was in.  It was like I was bothering him.
Time through TSA = no wait. Friendly people. Lots of interesting looking places to eat plus a local brewery spot. Clean too! It's funny, I usually like PDX the best, but didn't have a great experience the last time I was there, whereas PHX was super easy. The temperature is a bit stuffy, but hey it's Arizona. Getting in and out of the airport can be a little tricky, but nice airport overall.

This airport reminds me of the Denver airport. Clean, friendly, easy to navigate; check-in, security and baggage claim were quick, as was getting a taxi. You can also Uber it.
Worst terminal to terminal transportation in the world.....completely unsafe overloaded buses...a mgmt team that doesnt care about unsafe uncomfortable sardined packed passengers in buses....long wait times between overcrowded buses....... . Add some buses PHX.....your sky train thing doesnt go to each terminal.. . PS....and if you have a flight from terminal 2 or 3 and have to go to the east economy lot.....you have to get off the bus....trudge into terminal 4....go up a level,....amd walk a million miles to the sky train....just so they can show the feds of the high ridership......how inconvienent for travelers.....nice phx.
Being delayed is never pleasant but a well appointed airport could help.  Things like dining options, free wifi, charging outlets and seating areas.  All things that this airport lacks.. . The boarding areas are small and run into each other.  If everything is running smoothly, it's a tight fit but one small hiccup and BAAMM!  It's survival of the fittest.  Try balancing on your "22 inch suitcase while hovering over a prized outlet while you feel the heat of staring eyes who want your tiny spot.  Geesh.  . . Must pack spare battery.
It really does come down to which terminal you are flying through.. . Terminal 4 has been wonderfully updated.  The bar and restaurant selection continues to improve.  The big chains have been moved out and more locally known restaurants have moved in.  However, the big downside is that you need to be flying out of the A or B side of the terminal in order to get a better selection.  The sky train is also a convenient new addition over the buses when getting from the light rail or the east economy lot to terminal 4.  But it still doesn't go to the other terminals or the west economy lot.. . The other terminals, especially the small and nearly useless terminal 2, still have a ways to go.  Like the city it serves, Sky Harbor continues to improve but is still a massive work in progress.
I will only comment as a connecting passenger, so I am not sure what the check in and security areas are like. We arrived from Charlotte into Terminal 4 in the A gates. This part of the terminal was great---excellent food options like Pei Wei and it looked recently redone. Our next flight was down by the B gates to Long Beach, and this part of the terminal looked a bit more beat. Some was under construction for new restaurants, so that looked good. Other parts had standard, old food stands--not impressive. A was definitely better than B.. . Getting from gate to gate was pretty easy--plenty of moving walkways and the whole connecting ordeal took 10 minutes. Everything else was fine--nothing to complain about. Not a bad spot for a connection.
The skycap service at the east economy lot is a joke.  They won't take your bags if you get there 89 min before your flight or of you arrive at 6:00 pm on Sunday night (1 hour 45 min ) before your flight.
I wasn't here very long, but I was able to find some good food & drink easily!
Clean airport and easy to get around in.   I enjoy the free internet and food choices.   I try to connect through Phoenix if I have a choice.
Not a bad airport to transfer in.  Nothing to really complain about, my experiences here have been ok.  =)
Clean, quick airport to navigate. Lots of places to eat, grab a quick bite before a flight. . . Clean restrooms and seating was comfortable at the gates.
Phoenix is the most efficient large size airport I've been to. Security moves pretty quickly. It can be overwhelming with all the different terminals. I fly southwest mainly so I just remember that southwest is Terminal 4. There are plenty of restaurants (good ones) to choose from. My favorite coffee stop is the Peets Coffee right after security at D gates, simply because the drinks are delicious and there are plenty of lounge chairs and charging ports. There are a lack of charging ports in the D gates which is a downside for me. Also the other thing to remember is if you are renting a car, the shuttle ride to the rental car center is about 10 minutes so be prepared early so you have a little bit more extra time. With water bottle refilling stations and good eats, I don't mind layovers at Sky Harbor at all!
I like traveling, but don't necessarily like dealing with airports. But this one isn't too bad. I had a good 5 week stint with Sky Harbor Int as I was flying back every weekend from Texas to Phoenix for work. Food offerings were okay, security was as it should be, didn't really have any issues. *Kanye shrug*
UGH. Try to avoid this place if you can. The employees here are extremely RUDE! I had a reusable water bottle in my backpack and it had a half of inch of water(obviously less than 3 oz) and they made me get out of line told me they were going to throw my $20+ filtered water bottle away, they finally gave it back to me and made me go threw security all over again. WHAT?!
It's huge with lots of options for drinks and food.  It's updated and clean, too.. . Moving sidewalks and wide hallways make it easy to rush from gate to gate if you need to.  If you aren't in a rush, there are lots of spaces to buy a book or a coffee for your wait.
Nice staff and pretty views. I wish they had more to offer food wise in the c terminal.
Phucking Phoenix does it again. TSA is off on break, line about 75 people deep and 1 guy checking ID's. I'd rather take my chances with the terrorist than put up this level of coverage.
I feel like I gotta give Sky harbor a good review to offset the negatives.  It has definitely changed over the past year to include some of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  Most of my experience is in terminal 4.  Being able to choose from LGO, Chelseas Kitchen, Four Peaks, Blanco, Modern Burger, Barrio Cafe and Flos is awesome.  These choices really showcase the great local restaurants Phoenix has to offer.  . . I can see how some people are confused by the pickup and drop off procedures.  This is the only reason I am giving it four stars.  If you want to avoid that mess during the busy times I would highly recommend doing pickups and drop offs at the sky train.  There is literally zero traffic there and getting in and out is painless.  . . Free wifi is awesome and necessary.  Thanks for providing it.
We have THE best food choices of any airport
