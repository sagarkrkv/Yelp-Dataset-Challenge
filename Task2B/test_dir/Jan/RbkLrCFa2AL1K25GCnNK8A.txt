The worst place to stay ever!!!! The hotel staff is super rude. The ac in the room did not work. Made 3 phone calls and still never sent anyone to come check on it. Jerry at the check out desk is possibly the worst at his job. Rude attitude when we asked question and acted like we should have known all the answers. Will never stay here ever again nor will I recommend anybody to stay here. Rooms are totally outdated. Who knows what switch turns on which thing in the room. Just plain awful... Wish I could give 0 stars. Only going to stay on the strip. From. Now on...
Spent New Year's Eve here and loved it.. Why five stars? Because I kept winning at the slots downstairs. What's not to love!. The rooms were nice and large. And I can't stop saying it ... I won! I won! Yay! Happy New Year!
Mac at the limo office helped me to get around town. Also Said at the bell desk took care of me. Thanks guys.
I stayed here in the early days when it was a Hilton. It was a great hotel! I then stayed here a month or two before the hotel changed hands. It sucked! Given a good room deal, I thought I would give it one more go -- about a year later. Still sucks. . . Careful - they give out a coupon book to use throughout the hotel. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE SMALL FINE PRINT ON THE BACK OF EACH COUPON!!!
Stayed here the day after New Years ...to recover, avoid traffic back to Los Angeles and catch up on some rest. Price is appropriate for the room ;ess than $50 a night yet there is a problem with the control of smoking and non smoking areas. We had asked for non smoking floor... floor 17 the entire floor smell like pot and two different times we saw people smoking at the elevator waiting area. Overall the rooms are comfortable, standard. The casino is right below with enough tables (minimum $ 10.00) and machines. Wi-fi is $13.99 on one device, not free.
It was just okay . stair wells were dirty and the same plates were there the whole time I  was there.. . yuk
Staying at the LVH is probably the most frustrating hotel experience I've ever had. They do not provide the bare minimum that you could expect from a given holiday inn. I even asked the concierge for qtips and they acted like it was a ridiculous request and tried to send me to the nearest pharmacy. It does not feel clean and is extremely out of date. This is especially frustrating if here on business. The one positive thing I must say is that the housekeeping and room service staff is very pleasant and accommodating.
Really nice sports book, nice hotel room with a friendly staff.  The only issue is its off the strip and no nightlife inside the hotel.. For a nice stay in a hotel where your not going to party hard lvh is fine.
Im writing this as I leave and my experience was awesome my room was clean and espacious, costumer service awesome and we loved the pool and the fact tha we where so close to the strip but we didn't have to deal woth the nasty drunks and hookers. I have to admit I was a little scared by the negative reviews but It was perfect and for the price it cant he beat.
Dreadfully awful.  Stay away at all cost.
By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas. The only reason I stayed here was because of CES. Extremely long wait times just to check out and no good food here. The front desk rep PATTI was extremely rude and should not be working there. I simply wanted to know if I could get parking reimbursed since I was staying here, unfortunately I couldn't which was fine, what upset me was that she took my only key card and scanned it, didn't give it back and insisted that I never gave her one. I asked for her to check cameras to see while she still rudely insisted I gave her nothing, she THEN found a card and scanned it and found out it was mine. COMPLETE waste of my freaking time . . No complimentary toothbrush toothpaste water or basically any amenities. . I will never be returning here by choice ever again
My lord has this place changed!  Use to come here all the time. They were sold 4-5 years back, so I thought. Seems they are bank owned now. . . Use to have limo pick up with no problem. Well, my host arranged for it, but he put the wrong pick up time. Once the driver got there he was apologetic and explained the confusion. . . I went to check in and VIP check in was closed. I checked in the normal line and no comp card or tournament info was given to me. I asked asked and they were clueless. . . Hope they get it all figured out. Thi place use to be great. Games now suck, but I still get offers for free room and food, which is a good deal.. . I stopped by on my way back from Cali. I'm in the free tournament, I think. I'll find out around 9am. . . Overall, cheap place to stay with Mono rail service to the strip, or a short walk for the adventurous ones out there.
Stayed for a night while attending a concert and for the rediculously low weekend rate we got we expected worse, but in fact were pleasantly surprised, room was comfy/ clean and great for a quick Vegas Getaway. If I had to stay longer it probably wouldn't be my choice, but was a nice place to rest after a long day/ night. And besides, the King used to live here in the suite:)
I have stayed at this hotel for the last 16 years while attending CES. My company books the room so I have no choice. My experience last week was the worst. I had to be moved to a new room three times, the first was not made up when I went in, the second had no A/C or ventilation of any kind, the third time the room was OK.. My next major issue are the number of prostitutes that populate the casino, bars and lobby areas. They are quite obvious and bold, it's like walking through Times Square NY in 1981.. My final fault is I came back to the hotel at 10pm and needed to eat dinner, the coffee shop, Sports Book Deli, Pizza Hut and new burger place were all closed. What kind of place closes its restaurants so early in Vegas?
My stay at LVH was from December 28 through December 31, 2013.. . Overall, I felt the hotel was an acceptable venue. The room was comfortable, but showed signs of age, and the same could be said about the hotel as a whole. I think it's a reasonable choice for anyone looking for easy access to The Strip (via the Monorail) without paying Strip prices. A more detailed review follows.. . We received a room on the 19th floor of the North Tower, which has not yet been remodeled. The elevator bank had five elevators, but as far as we could tell, only four were operational. There were multiple times of day requiring very long waits (up to five minutes) to get an elevator, and when going down, we'd often stop at almost every floor, frequently leaving people behind because there was no more room. When leaving our room, we took to pushing the "up" button and riding to the top just so we'd be guaranteed an elevator.. . The room itself was a fairly average hotel room. It was clear that it was older and in need of remodeling. The most disappointing aspect was the television. I'd read online that the room would have a flatscreen TV, so I brought along an HDMI cable in the hopes of streaming video from my laptop. However, the TV was one of the oldest type of flatscreens I'd ever seen, and therefore had no HDMI connection. The picture itself was problematic because the aspect ratio was set to something odd and stretchy, and we were unable to fix it because there was no aspect button on the remote, and the "menu" button on the TV itself had either been disabled or was broken. On the positive side, the bed was quite comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was a decent size, and the tub was large. The shower pressure was on the weaker side, but not so much as to be problematic. I was also pleased that the a/c unit, while definitely old, worked well and was not annoying noisy when cutting off and on.. . The dining that we did within the hotel was actually very good. We enjoyed meals at Benihana and at the Burger Bistro. Both were quite tasty. We were very surprised, however, to find that when we went to the Burger Bistro on a Saturday night, they were closing at 9pm. We took a seat at 8:45 without knowing this, and quickly found ourselves to be the only guests. However, the serving staff was still very pleasant and helpful, and did not seem bothered by our late arrival. . . My biggest frustration with the hotel related to their tennis facility. I was very excited to see that they had tennis on the premises, including a pro shop, and I had my tennis gear with me. The hotel advertised that the facilities were open daily from 9am to 5pm, and the pro shop was open until 3pm. So I headed down with my gear, and initially could not figure out how to even get to the pro shop. Many of the signs were faded and difficult to read, and I found that the main path, which is through the pool area, was closed off since the pool was closed. Eventually, I was directed by someone at the spa to walk around, which involved walking over a strange gravel path, behind the mechanical equipment on the roof of the building. And, as you might have guessed, when I got to the pro shop, it was closed, and all of the tennis courts were locked up. The sign on the door indicated that someone would return in 15 minutes, but it was fairly obvious looking inside that no one had been there that day, and probably in quite some time beyond that. I called the phone number on the door and left voicemail, but I never heard back from anyone for the duration of the trip.. I'm not much for shopping in these sorts of properties, so I don't feel like I can comment much on how interesting the stores were. We visited the gift shop a couple of times for sundries and found what we needed. A sweets shop appeared to be on the verge of opening, and the only other store I recall was focused on items with bling. . . My last comment would be regarding the parking. We parked consistently in the lot for the North Tower, which is a multi-story structure with no physical attachment to the hotel. Getting to the hotel involved a bit of a walk, including crossing an internal "street." I watched a number of people struggle to lug luggage across this path, and I couldn't help but think how miserable that would be in extreme cold or heat or rain. Certainly not ideal.. . Despite the complaints, I would still be willing to stay here again, although it would not be my first (or second or third) choice. It's a functional hotel with a few perks, but it has quite a ways to go in order to be on par with its Strip counterparts. Hopefully, the construction we were able to see during our stay means they're working on it.
This review is about the New Years Eve party.  We started at the 105.7 party it was a blast. The music was great.  We missed Evelyn Champagne K. But caught Next, they did great and gave a good show with all the 90's hits. The crowd was mixed but mostly black.  Guys had on suits and the girls were dressed nice.  The bar was too packed. That is my only complaint. . . We headed out by the pool to watch the fireworks.  As you were walking towards the pool people were handing out party favors which was nice.  Everyone was out there kids, older couples it was beautiful. It was chilly but it's winter in the desert.  . . We went back in and heard some live Reggae man was it the bomb this crowd was multicultural.  Although they only played one more song another Reggae band came on and jammed. It was by far the best New years eve ever!  It didn't hurt that the parties were free except the 105.7 party. I didn't even mind that they had a cash bar. . . I hope to go back next year. ...
Almost every time I come to Vegas I stay here because its perfect for what I'm looking for in my Vegas adventure. . . I come here to get outside and enjoy myself or go gambling until 9am without having to sell a kidney and I get all of that here. Now let me also say, I'm a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I'm not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of "you get what you pay for" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH. . . I'm not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol. . . Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don't care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let's hope not!). . The room itself was very comfortable and didn't make me feel cheap. Now I understand this place isn't flashy like other hotels but I don't spend most of my time in my room, that's not why you come to Vegas! But when I am done with my daily adventure or need to rejuvenate I want to feel that I'm lying on clean sheets, the room is comfortable and I can relax. Each and every time it I was completely satisfied. . . Soooooo, try it out! It's very inexpensive and there are all kinds of ways to get deals on this place. Hotwire, Hotels.com, sign up on their email list and immediately get 30% off, sign up on their mobile line and get another deal. I've even seen offers on Hotel Tonight. DEALS, DEALS, DEALS....I like that too. . . Happy Vegas Adventures!
Rooms were clean and spacious.  Patty at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.  Love the restaurants in the hotel, Benihanas was great but service was a little slow.  Paradise cafe offered good all-day breakfasts.  Staff was super nice except for a douchey guy at the front desk.  But hey, everyone has had at least one bad day in their lives, right?  I really liked this place and it would be perfect if they still had the Star Trek experience here.  . . Definitely would stay here again.
39.99 a night? Not bad. The rooms are fine and the place is clean. My BF and I had a prefectly comfortable 2 night's sleep. . . I would stay again if I was on a super budget and wanted to go to Vegas. Its about the same as a motel and much safer. . . Room service is an over priced joke.
Ok so for the bad reviews.... Yea i could see that how the old management was not the best based on your reviews.. The Lvh got better with the new management.. they have newly renovated rooms that are compact and practical..  Ms.Stephanie at the front desk was very kind and assisted with all of our needs.. Always ask for non smoking and upgrade to the strip view.. Anyone up for the parking lot view or the maintenance yard?. I would not.. Bottom line, the lvh has improved drastically.
We came here for my bachlorette party after i had read a few reviews about this place, and it wasn't bad. Yes it is a little far from the strip but they have a monorail that takes you pretty much anywhere you want to go and for a pretty cheap price. The rooms were not bad they were pretty decent, the casino was a tad small but that didnt matter much either.They had some pretty good restraunts inside this hotel that made it a lot better too. The benihanna in the las vegas hotel and casino was the prettiest I have ever seen I was pretty impressed.  If you are on a tight budget this place would be a great place to stay.
This place is a fkn dump. Excuse my language. Awful food!!! From room service to breakfast all the way to their restaurants. I ate for free on every visit. Why? Because I sent it all back! From the awful showers to having no hbo. When i called housekeeping for toothpaste? No sorry sir we don't have that. Umm?? Ok. I can just keep going. Worst casino hotel I have ever stayed in. Never ever again
I would give them a five, but check in literally took like half an hour and we were on a time crunch! Had to get reaaady for the club man. . . So a friend and I decided to do a YOLO ONE night trip to Vegas to see Dash Berlin, and we booked this hotel the day of for only $33, and got upgraded to a larger room since the one we were originally suppose to get was unavailable. But whatevs. The bigger the room, the more fun right? Well in our case, the more room to throw our shit everywhere, get dressed and get ready and get our drank on. . . After the club, we came back pretty drunk, knocked out and felt like we were sleeping on a cloud. Probably cause we were drunk and didn't care. Check out time is at noon, and they have the option of express check out if you don't want to wait in line, but overall I had a pretty good stay here.. . The hotel is off the strip, but they offer a monorail service at $5 to take you to the Strip. However my friend and I were in a rush, thought taking a taxi would be faster, but it was twice the amount, but only took like 10 minutes. So take the monorail! You'll save $$$, plus you'll have more $$$ to spend at the club.. . If anyone is planning to do a YOLO, IDGAF trip, I would recommend staying here. Rooms are clean, well kept and bathroom is a good size.
Cheap rooms off the strip.. No more than a ten dollar ride to wynn hotel.. Downside is that there's no early check-in.. Gaming and gambling is a plus. . ...$30 for some mixed nuts off the room service menu?
First let me say that we love this hotel! .  Our third time here and the hotel went out of their way to make our birthday weekend special! We have a large suite on the 28th floor which is very clean and well maintained! After putting our things down we went to the resort lounge and had cheese and wine watched some news and came back up. Upon walking in we found a fruit plate with champagne waiting for us! Wow! We have stayed at a lot of places in Vegas some way more expensive and we were never treated this nicely! The LVH goes out of their way to make you feel like family! Check in was easy and simple no hidden fees and no drama. Hotel lobby and casino were extremely clean and the bell desk got our things up quickly! Don't listen to bad reviews give this place a chance because it will not disappoint. :) we will update after we check out but trust me this place is amazing.
I was a little worried at first but to my surprise it was great! We got upgraded to a suite by Abel at check in (he was great and professional and polite) and our room was clean and very pleasant with a great view. I will definitely stay here again!
My wife and I have stayed here many times during the 22 years we've lived in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas. It was, for a while, "Our Place" in Vegas, that is, until Hilton pulled out and the "LVH" took over. The famous staff friendliness and professionalism steadily dwindled and we found other places to stay and make "donations" to. . . Well, the LVH sent us a slew of marketing communications recently and we finally took them up on their 3 free night, with food comps and gambling free play. The first night, upon arriving, we were asked to stop at the parking garage entrance by a very polite security guard so he could "grab some information off your car", which he did so quickly, then thanked us and waved us through. No biggie, and when asked, he explained they'd had a rash of vehicle break ins lately (a good reason right there to stay away?). . Upon returning the next evening after a day out, we were signaled to stop at the entrance to the parking garage by a different security guard (name started with first initial "D"). He never said anything to us, until I started to inch forward thinking he was done with his silent interrogation, then he blew a gasket. He escalated the confrontation until I finally lost my temper and decided we were done, and would exit the parking garage, upon which he yelled "f**k you" several times at me.. . We went into the hotel and filed a complaint with the hotel manager and head of security, then checked out 2 days early and went to our new favorite property, who welcomed us back and comped our room. . Needless to say, we'll never return and I'd strongly recommend you find other accommodations too. So sad to see this historic property run into the ground!
This review is on the front desk staff and our stay. We booked this hotel through Hotwire for a killer deal, there's an 'resort fee' on top of the rate which was the cost of the room but still a better deal than anything else online. . . We checked into the hotel in the afternoon, got to the room and the room was 'used' the bed wasn't made, the soap was opened a towel on the floor in the bathroom. We called down to the front and they upgraded our room and brought us up a key. Problem solved, late checkouts often cause issues so it wasn't a big deal. . . Tip for families, North Tower by North Tower parking garage, the rooms cost an upgrade fee but you don't have to trek through the casino and you're right by your parked car if you park there. The rooms are upgraded and easy in and out. . . The second time I stayed there, I asked for a room North Tower by the N. towert parking garage and they hooked it up. The room was nice, clean and quick in and out. . . The coffee in the room is k-cups and they charge 3.50 for the paper cup and cup of coffee with the creamer and sugar packets inside. Hey it's there in your room and pretty tasty, you can always bring your own k-cups if you are hooked on those things, me personally i prefer a fresh cup of coffee! . . That's all for now. :)
