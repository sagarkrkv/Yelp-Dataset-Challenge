This happened at around 2:30 pm on New Year's Eve,  I have to say that my visit to this awesome restaurant was marred by watching one of its outside line girls accept a bribe.  What happened that the couple behind us learned together with us that the line was around one hour long.  The person behind us offered her ( and I could not see how much he gave her) some money.  She accepted and they cut to the front of the line and were whisked into the restaurant.  I know this goes on in a lot of places but I had not expected BurGR to have these types of employees.  I don't even expect anyone from this restaurant read this but I hope they do and take appropriate action.. . Oh and we had the awesome Hells Kitchen burger and the truffle cheddar fries.. . Enjoy this place!
Visit 1/2...truffle fries-over rated IMO, just ok. Jalepeno poppers- came already dipped in sauce. I like to control the amount of sauce on my food, but made for nice presentation. I was bummed to find out only 1 of the poppers were spicy and my husband got it. Won't order those again. Then....then there were the most delicious wings I've ever eaten. Served with blue cheese crumbles and shredded carrots...my mouth is watering just thinking about them. Not too spicy not too sweet...the sauce is SO good (I even ordered an extra side of sauce). My rating would have been a 3 if not for the wings. We actually ended up here a second time on our trip and I ordered inky the wings...which made that trip a 5. The service is decent. My glass was never empty and everything came out in a timely manner.
I was starving when me and my friend got here. It was just the two of us and they told us it'd be an hour wait. They ended up seating us a little earlier. Our food came out super fast which was nice. I ordered the yardburger and my friend got the 3 cheese one. I also got the Oreo creme brulee shake and we split the truffle parmasean fries. Basically after finishing only about a quarter of our food we decided we should have just split one burger because they are huge and skipped the fries. Overall everything was delicious and totally worth the price but I ended up getting sick afterwards. Not sure if it was because I ate it super fast or the quality of the food itself.
Farm Burger was good. The duck-breast bacon added good flavor but it was not crispy, which I'm guessing has something to do with it being duck-breast based. The burger itself was cooked well and had good flavor. Parmesan fries were good and crispy and served with a very tasty garlic aioli. It was a little pricey but I would go back to try one of the hot dogs.
I only give four stars because the service was sub-par. We waited too long for everything. It took 10 minutes for us to even see our waiter once we were seated and the beers took 10 minutes after that!. That being said, the food was perfect!!! I ordered the Damnation Chicken burger and was surprised with a juicy ground chicken burger. While it was not as spicy as I would have liked, the carrot celery slaw was perfectly crunchy and the blue cheese was rich and creamy. Definitely a winner. My boyfriend had the American burger and was blown away with the simple awesomeness.. We chose to order the regular fries which come with curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup, both amazingly good. I put the chipotle ketchup on my burger as well. In retrospect, I would have definitely ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. An order went by us and looked amazing.. I wasn't feeling dessert, but the milkshakes andother desserts that went by looked like they were straight out of the menu pictures. They also provide you with a tablet that has the drink menus and some of the cocktails looked very interesting. The beers were $6/$7 which was cheaper than any casino bar. Overall it was a great food experience, but the service was a letdown. Don't let that deter you, though. Enjoy!
The best BurGR in Vegas! The Burgers and milkshakes are amazing!!! Truly took me by surprise. By far the best I've had.
I love all of the Gordon Ramsay shows... I am a big fan. However the burger restaurant does not deserve five stars at all.. . It is definitely four stars... They don't have a lot of choices on the menu for different types of burgers. And the burger itself is good... But underwhelming for the price you pay. If I'm going to pay $15 for a hamburger... It better well be a really good burger.. . The reason I gave it four stars and not three stars... Is that the anti-fries and the homemade ketchup along with the mayonnaise truffle sauce is absolutely wonderful.  However $12 for french fries is also ridiculous.. . The service is very slow because the restaurant gets pretty busy especially at lunch and dinner times. It is best to go when they first opened and then you don't have to wait to get in... But you still have to wait for the food.. . If you compare this to let's say one of my favorite burger joints... Smash burger. It really pales in comparison because of the price point. You can get a awesome smash burger... And smash fries for under $10.  Annual walk away very satisfied.. . I paid $30 for a burger and fries at this place... And was good... But just did not have that wow factor I was expecting.
My burger patty came out well-done despite ordering it medium. The patty was burnt as well and very dry, and made my Euro Burger taste like it was overcooked by an amateur at a backyard BBQ. It was the type of patty Gordon Ramsay would go apesh*t over, like, 1st week of Hell's Kitchen level of rage. It was so well-done I could have worn it as leather. It was so burnt that this cow's offspring shed a tear that this patty went to waste. However, the sesame bun, goat cheese, arugula, and the baked tomato in the burger was tasty. But the star of the burger, the patty, was not what I had anticipated. It was definitely not even close to one of the best burgers I've ever had. . . For the big name of this restaurant and the heavenly level of dining quality of Gordon Ramsay, this was a big let down. I can't help but think that this is a totally different burger place than was featured on MasterChef.
We watch Kitchen Nightmares so we were curious and anxious to eat here since Chef Ramsey has such uncompromising standards. At least on TV.. . I must say that the experience was inconsistent at best and disappointing at worst.  . . We went early New Year's Eve and waited only 25 minutes or so for a table, which I guess is pretty good. . . I got the blue cheese burger, and it was not good at all. The beef was overcooked to the point of being dry and difficult to swallow. I had asked for pink in the middle to keep it juicy, but there was not a drop of juice in that burger and there was no pink. Come on, it's a burger, they should know how to cook it right. If Chef Ramsey had tasted my burger he would have made a face and pushed it away, claiming that it was so dry as to be inedible. And he would be right.. . On the other hand, the wife's Farm Burger was excellent and cooked correctly. The flavors came together and the wife loved it. . . The onion rings were the best I have ever had, light and not greasy.. . Like almost every restaurant on the strip, this place is over-priced with some mediocre food. To his credit, the burgers are not as over-priced as at some restaurants on the strip (just walk through various hotels and look at the outrageous prices). Still, with two burgers, onion rings, and a couple of beers plus tax and tip the bill was over $70, and only one of the burgers was any good. . . The wife would return, but she would have to go alone because I would not return.
This place gets WAY too much hype.  Oily, unpressed food and service.  Will not return.  No grill marks on my burger.  No flavor.  WACK!. . My service was horrible!  My server was preoccupied to perform required tasks such as taking my order and filling my glass.  I had to flag down other server/busboy to take care of these things.  My coffee cup sat empty most of the time there.. . Sweet Potato Fries-standard; jalapeno mayo-no heat. Truffle Parmesan Fries-not fried to my liking what i would consider a crisp fry.  aioli was weak and unimpressed.  at least real parm was used however it was not well distributed.  not impressed at all. . Farm Burger-unimpressed.  Duck breast bacon was gimmicky at best.  Nothing to report other than oily wet unimpressed burger.  Asked for med rare and pretty much got a rare burger.  Server took forever to come and check on us by the time she did my burger was almost eaten.  She was so bad that I did not want another burger.  . . Chanterelle Burger-unimpressed; best part was the arugula and  figgy-onion jam. . Britannia Burge- unimpressed mango chutney + arugula. . get the pattern?  make overly oily and bad burgers and add toppings on them.... . Best part was leaving knowing that I would never come back.  Another celeb establishment blown up with super hype from the general public.  Joke
Went around New Year's,  great location and hours. Good looking menu, next time I'm trying the duck bacon burger. The truffle fries are delicious,  I enjoyed the aioli but not the ketchup.  My fiancee was first hesitant of the ketchup but at the end raved about it. I just got the regular burger and it was pretty good. I will go again on next visit.  Reason for three stars my waiter never checked on us until it was check time.
Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay, I had to try his restaurant BurGR. I heard that the wait can be pretty long to be seated, but fortunately when I arrived around 5pm, I only had to wait 10 minutes. . . I ordered the Chanterelle burger, the Britannia burger, and a side of fries. The meat itself was excellent and very juicy on both burgers. I prefer the Chanterelle because the mango chutney on the Britannia was a little bit too sweet for my liking. The fries were decent but nothing amazing about them. . . Overall, I enjoyed my experience here, and the waiting staff was very friendly. I will have to come back again to try the Farm burger!
Tasty burger, the bread is def a big plus point, a bit crispy outside. High quality meat and amazing sauce. Recommend order onion rings and eat the burger with a bit of their truffle sauce.
Tonight I had the pleasure of trying the farm, euro, blue, and brittian burgers. The fried egg with duck breast bacon was good, but if you only have a burger with truffle aioli and goat cheese cheese once, you should have it here.  Our server Megan made all of the right suggestions.
This burger joint is located inside Planet Hollywood.  We lined up to put our name down, which was a small wait in addition to the 1.5 hrs we waited to be seated.  The nice thing about BurGR is that they'll take your phone number and will text you when your table is ready.  I think all restaurants should switch to this method.  We killed some time by gambling in the casino.. . The restaurant is casual, but you can tell a lot of detail was put into everything.  I liked the silverware that Gordon chose with the unique knife that rests perfectly on the plates. . . I ordered the farm burger, which was delicious.  The duck bacon and fried egg on the burger went well together.  My cousins and I shared truffle fries and a house hot dog.  The truffle fries come with a curry ketchup and truffle aioli.  The fries were very good, but the hot dog wasn't to my taste.  I felt as though it has a very strong vinegar taste to it.  Kind of like it went swimming in hot buffalo wing sauce.  . . Definitely a good place to try if you're looking for a fancy burger place on the strip.
I'm sorry, but I was really looking forward to this place. My boyfriend took our friend from Malibu, California and I to this place and the wait was an hour and thirty minutes. I always knew there was a wait so that was of no concern. An hour and ten minutes later we tried to check in and apparently they did text us, but sometimes the system "doesn't work". Luckily, we checked in. The server was very nice, but the busser was extremely helpful. Now, the food runner was extremely rude to my boyfriend when he asked which burger was which. The manager never stopped once;  though it was a question on the review they hand out after your meal. . . What got me the most was the fact that their burger was nothing special. The meat was dry and the parmesan truffle fries were very hard. The sweet potato fries were ok though. . . Just came home and my stomach is really hurting. I am thinking my meat was undercook. . . Overall, go for the experience, but I definetely wouldn't go back. All the employees looked miserable.
So disappointed....was our first trip to vegas and had many people recommend this restaurant. Love the shows on TV and was looking forward to a fabulous meal. . The wait was not bad, about 20 min. We were seated and our order taken, that was the end of the good experience. We waited and waited, we saw others seated after us get their meal and still we waited. A different waiter came and said he would check on our meal. My husband was watching the waitress we had and when she was questioned by the second waiter her response was ' oh crap I forgot to put it in' the second waiter came back to our table and apologized by telling us the kitchen was backed up due to the busy time of day. Out and out lie!!!!  When our meal finally came the food was indeed good, but the experience from the service has caused us to want to never go back. There was no offer to comp the bill or apologise for the waitress. Only excuses for the kitchen cooks, and it was not their fault at all.
I wish I could give more than 5 stars! The staff were very friendly, and helpful.  Very quick service.  I think the best service I've received in Vegas. The food is indescribable, because it is so phenomenal. The burgers were exploding with flavor.  The fries were awesome as well.  Each bite was like heaven in your mouth.  I've been here twice now, and will come back often.  I took my friend here recently for here birthday, and she is now a fan as well. . . P.S. Do not go to or try Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill.  Horrible service and sub par food. Extremely disappointing! Especially after having been to Gordon Ramsay's burgers.
AMAZING & DELICIOUS are the two words I would use to describe the food. This was our second time there and my family and I ordered jalapeno poppers, parmesan fries, regular fries and a burger each. They all loved their burgers and so did I. I ordered the American burger (I believe that's the name) I like to keep my burgers classic. It was delicious but I ordered medium-well and there was a section of my burger that was as pink as my boyfriends burger and he ordered medium rare. It was a very small section and wasn't a big deal so I just didn't eat it as my stomach can be very sensitive. . . Also, the waitress asked us how our meal was and my Mom who is very honest let her know that she loved it but the Parmesan fries were more on the hard/crunchy side than soft. The waitress took it off the bill! My mom wasn't even complaining, she was just stating her honest opinion. Now to me that is excellent customer service! I can't wait to go back.
Great ambience and service... Loved how they had an interactive iPad drink menu and also a survey on the iPhone to take afterwards... Really neat.. . Now for the important stuff: felt the food was overrated, we ordered the jalepeno poppers which were our favorite of the night but after that it just went downhill from there. The farm burger is supposed to be served with an overEASY egg so the yolk is all runny but we got a way overlooked egg and missed out on the best part of the burger. The chanterelle burger, supposed to be topped with a lot of mushrooms... There were hardly any on it! And the truffle fries!!! Couldn't eat more than an handful they were way too salty! . . Overall, overpriced and overrated! Wouldn't come back here for a 2nd time.
Gordon Ramsay all the way!! He fu**ing knows what hes' doing!! :D. Good range of not so usual burgers and great tasting too........without a doubt! Got chicken wings for the toddler and they were oh so good...!. This place is like fine dinning burger joint :) The shakes here are so indulgent that we went for a second helping!!! Needs a big appetite to guzzle everything down!. The wait staff is genuinely friendly and ambience is hip.
Let me first say that I am not a burger eating kind of gal. I will be honest about having my doubts about paying for a $14 (on average) for a "gourmet" burger. This place blew this thought out of the water fairly quickly. . . My group and I decided to share 2 burgers and fries. What we learned was that we should have just either gotten the 2 burgers to share or 3 burgers instead. But honestly, we were pretty filled with the hell's kitchen (beef: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato) & southern yardbird (chicken: sharp cheddar, mustard BBQ sauce, pickle, butter lettuce) burgers and sweet potato fries. . . Our group had one guy so don't think it was only 3 girls with itty bitty appetites. We were all pretty filled and content after leaving this place to explore Planet Hollywood some more. The portion size was on the larger side as the meat patty was anything but small. The service was GREAT as our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful (I asked for recommendations for a cell phone repair place and our server asked around and came back with a place).. . I would absolutely recommend this place if you're wanting the most juicy and tender burgers--like ever. :) If you're visiting the casinos in the area, this place is a great place to eat--and in walking distance of the casinos as well. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is very popular so be patience if there is a slight line.
First Thoughts: We're going to be raging with Gordon Ramsey tonight? . . To answer the question: yes and no. My bf and I raged at BurGR but Ramsey was not in attendance to see it. Hopefully, he'll get a chance to read about it in this review. . . We got to BurGR around 7 pm and waited between 40-45 minutes--to be seated at the bar. Beware. BurGR does not take reservations and they operate on a first come first serve basis. Be prepared to wait between the hours of 4-9 pm. I had called earlier in the day to try and make reservations only to be told to come after 9 pm--when the crowds start dying down.. . We were seated after only waiting 40 minutes because we opted to sit at the bar. Had my bf and I opt for a table, our wait would have been much longer. The bar area has several large TV screens tuned to sports channels so if you enjoy sports, it's something to consider. Also, the bar chairs are glued into the ground with an awkward space in-between. If you are on a date, you will not be sitting physically close to your date at the bar. . . Once seated, my bf ordered the Euro burger and I ordered the granny apple Caesar salad with dressing on the side. We were offered our waters and we waited another 10-15 minutes for our food. . . The one word I would use to describe the food: underwhelming. My salad was just a pile of greens with slices of apples placed on top with some pieces of Parmesan cheese and croutons sprinkled throughout. It was unimpressive and tasted like any other Caesar salad, with or without granny apples. My salad was hardly justified by its exorbitant price of $12. Especially, when I know I could have purchased the same salad at Trader Joes for half the price. . . My bf's burger looked better but after a few bites, he said his burger was dry and well done, not medium, which was what he had asked for. I tried some of the meat and agreed: it was well done, not medium. . . Bottom line: This was a rookie's mistake and unacceptable in a well-established Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Paired with my ordinary salad, the burger was not up to par with a restaurant only specializing in burgers. If this is their niche, they need to step up quality control and not let this happen in the future. I will not be returning for more sad salads, over done burgers and long lines.  . . *End rage.
I was so excited to come here because I love Gordon Ramsey and wanted to see his creative take on burgers.  First thought was the layout seemed very cluttered and it was so loud.  The menu was pretty neat looking and the food descriptions looked fun inside it so I had hope. My boyfriend wanted to try their truffle parmesan fries which  ended up being super thick cut fries, and the truffle portion was in this goopey mayo dip, it just was not  appetizing.  I like bachi burgers way better.  I got the euro burger.  I thought the oven roasted tomato would be roasted long enough where it created a sweet acidic contrast to the goat cheese it just was so bland tasting, and basic for being 16 dollars. My boyfriend got the hells kitchen burger and the porportians were way off and was overloaded with avocado so you only tasted that, and the jalepinio was barely registering.  My boyfriend wanted the creme brulee oreo shake and once again just not proportionate.  What small amount of oreo shake was in it was super yummy but the creme brulee portion took up like half of it since the bottom of the glasses where the shake is are skinny.  Creme brulee is a very heavy custard and is best served in a shallow dish, and then has the nice crackly caramelized sugar on top.  It would have been better if they had used this component to accent the shake rather than take it over, and it would have been nice if they actually had the crackly caramelized sugar on top, without it, its just creme...The service was at least very good, I will give them that.  So overall I wouldn't go back, if you want a great fancy burger go to bachi burger it's much better, and less expensive. This place is way overpriced for flavor profiles that are not executed properly, and lack balance.
"Can a three-Michelin awarded celebrity chef, a generally angry Scottish/English guy and successful psychopath, pull off the great American classic?" What a world we live in that we have to ask ourselves that kind of question. BurGR is, however, an attempt to give us an answer.. . The verdict? Nah, not completely.. . BurGR is situated near one of the Planet Hollywood's entrances that face the Strip. You're greeted by giant arcs of unnecessary pyrotechnics as you wait in line, with Ramsay's scowling face and merchandise staring back at you as you mingle amongst the other people that are interested in the same question you are. Peeking into the restaurant, you can catch glimpses of the wait staff-- dressed like they're in an upscale Hooters-- and the open kitchen with guys working the line like they're still hoping to make it big someday. . . And you know what? Sometimes, the dress does make the person. Or something. Because on my visit the floor staff was unbelievably lackadaisical, riding the coattails of the restaurant's name cause there's a bunch of suckers, including me, lined up wanting in There was no urgency anywhere... except, interestingly, by the background crew: the chefs. Only until I got a seat near the open kitchen, already berating myself for waiting a full hour just to get a burger at this place, that it became clear to me that there was a definite disconnect between the folks in the kitchen and the kids waiting the tables. The kitchen is a picture of efficiency-- guys have their heads down, calling out orders, making sure shit is right. Their movements are careful, but there's urgency-- they want to get you your food ASAP before the orders start stacking up. Just as any good restaurant should be.. . Then you have the wait staff. I really don't know what BurGR is aiming to be, but there needs to be better training somewhere. I was literally served by the sous chef working that day (it's written on his name-tag) simply because he kept calling for "hands" and no one would get the goddamn order out of the kitchen. "But HC, the staff must be swamped! Cut them some slack!" If they were, I wasn't seeing it. I saw wait staff flirting back and forth with each other in that kind of creepy incestual way. I saw a lot of unfilled waters. I saw a lot of food waiting on the line for longer than they probably should have been there. Are any of you folks that ate here wondering why your food was lukewarm/cold? Uh, that's probably why. Granted I'm not a professional at this shit but I do know that if the restaurant is, at the moment, as successful as it is you really want to at least pretend to give a damn. I really should have asked if my tip was going to the sous chef instead of the waitress, cause she sure wasn't serving me my food and outlining what I had ordered.. . But I digress. We're here to talk food, aren't we? BurGR serves, as the name implies, burgers. You can get the classic cheeseburger but there's lots of interesting little twists. For my visit, I went with truffle fries and a medium rare Farm Burger, which has duck bacon and a fried egg. There's really a lot of fries so one order can easily be split between two people, and you'll want to-- despite being cut into wedges (which is already kind of a bastardization of what us fat Americans want thank-you-very-much), they had a lot of flavor and the house ketchup really evened things out. Solid.. . Then there's the burger.. . Sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. (Don't look at me like that.) When I was ordering this burger, I was excited. Squirming in my chair, even. Not that hard to act like that after waiting so long to try the goods. But the problem with this particular burger is twofold: there's no real texture and the patty itself is pretty underseasoned. It's soft on soft on soft on soft-- soft and airy bun (tasty), soft patty, soft (and flavorless) egg, and limp (bordering soft) duck bacon. I really didn't get a strong beef taste-- I got a mild, distinct duck flavor. . . And... that's kind of it. . . The patty was woefully underseasoned and lacking a strong upfront presence. And isn't the burger meant to be the star? Did these Brits bring their underseasoned food here as well? Cause to me, biting into a burger should be an experience. When you bite into that patty, you want that hit of char and salt on your tongue, beefy fat dribbling down your chin and on your fingers, the other ingredients lending texture and cutting richness. Right? Was it strange that I thought In-N-Out does a better burger than this? Is it blasphemous to say that? Cause screw it, I will. The burger was lacking in soul, ingredients be damned. The whole is more than the sum of its parts and all that. . . If you want a solid burger there's other places to hit in Vegas. BurGR's worth a try for certain if you're willing to brave the wait, but if you're thinking you're about to bite into the best burger of your life... eh, you can do better.
This restaurant seems promising given the long wait and high volume of customers. Also, I had high hopes since Gordon Ramsay created this. Sadly, service was slow. It took about half an hour to bring out our burgers. What is even worse, my friend's burger had hair in it. Also, the burger itself wasn't anything too special. I know a burger place in Irvine that makes better burgers than Gordon Ramsay's. I do agree with most people that their truffle fries are pretty good. Other than that, I willnot be back here again.
Hi again, well I did it, I am the first and only person to complete the entire menu at BurGR, got to meet Gordon himself too at the year anniversary party, he was funny and nice, just a great guy you would want to share a beer with - as usual on my recent trip I dined at BurGR about 4 times, I have eating everything on the menu so now I'm creating new things like having a burger with pita bread instead of a bun, but the best thing is a burger wrapped on lettuce, Paleo diet freindly! (thanks to my boy Garret on dayshift) it was awesome, I even had my buddy Jason try it and he liked it too and ordered one himself the next visit. As always everyone there is amazing, Managers Darren, Benji and Emily came and talked to me and always make every visit great, Servers Garret, Jahaira, Alex with glasses, James, Ginger, cute lil blond girl, guy with Mohawk (sorry couldn't remember everyone's name when I was writing this) and a cast of others always take damn good care of me, I usually ask for 3 tea's and a water (no lemon, that's very important and it's a test to see if my server is really listening to me), cause I drink pretty quickly and they always get it right, are fun to talk to, know the menu front to back, make good suggestions, which in turn makes it for a better dinning experience, also the busser's Jennifer and Kelly kicked butt too, the chefs are always entertaining and friendly, even when they are busy as crap, they will still take time out to say hi, one of the reason's I always sit back there is I like to watch everybody working in the kitchen and see how things run "HANDS PLEASE" - over all I have not had a bad experience yet, still don't understand anyone's bad reviews, but I guess every one's experience isn't always the same as everyone else's right, If youhad a bad experience the first time I would suggest a second trip back, maybe walk to the front of the line and ask for a manager and just "calmly" explain that your first experience wasn't that great and I bet they will go over and beyond to make sure that doesn't happen on your 2nd experience. As for me I go back to Vegas in 18 days and I will probably eat at least 3 times there, the entire staff from the girls at the front, managers, servers, busser's, chefs are always incredible to me and any one I have brought there or told to dine there, even if you don't want a burger go for the desserts ;) till next time David Cagle
We dined here during a recent stay through the new years week.    6 of us attempted to collect a table to find that we had an hour wait.  That was fine, although it would have been better to have good cell phone service (thank you AT&T for sucking on that one) so that we received our table-ready text on time.  . . We were seated and spent some time joking with the waiter who was probably the best part of the experience.  Great guy.  . . In short, the food isn't great.  I wanted to LOVE it as I am interested in Gordon Ramsay's cooking, but honestly, if this food was something he tasted at another establishment, I can guarantee you that he'd be all over it with scoldings. . . We ordered 6 burgers with various toppings, 3 orders of french fries and jalapeno poppers.  The best part of the meal was the poppers.    Each served in its own little shotglass of dip, they were tasty with a kick. . . The burgers were overdone and dry (I asked for medium.. got well done, along with 4 other burgers).   The uber cheese, which was my selection was excellent in the taste of the cheeses but chowing down on a dry hunk of meat was less than thrilling. . . The french fries were also quite overdone - hard and crunchy, lacking flavor, even with the spicy ketchups served with them.   We ordered 3 servings and MAYBE ate 1 entire serving across the 6 of us, when all was said and done. . . Despite the lines to get in to this place, I'd skip it - it's just not worth it if a top-name restaurant can't deliver their food as the customer ordered it.
Got here around 3:30 or so on New Years Day. For couples, they said the wait was about 30-35 minutes, and it was. The restaurant looks so cool...fans of Hell's Kitchen might appreciate that it kind of resembles the HK show kitchen. Anyway, I'm not a huge burger fan, so I got the Southern Yardbird (chicken burger + sharp cheddar + mustard bbq sauce+ pickle + butter lettuce)   and my fiance got the Damnation Chicken Burger (fiery hot mayo + maytag blue cheese + celery & carrot slaw. Plus we ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Sweet Potato fries. OMG. everything was so good. Now, I'll say that the Damnation chicken burger was better than the southern Yardbird...that spicy mayo and the slaw give it the extra kick that it needs to take it over the top! the parm truffle fries were delish and came with 2 sauces that were fantastic. and the Sweet potato fries came with some kind of powdered sugar on them that made them amazing too! I wish I had ordered a milkshake too, but now I have a reason to go back! Loved it and it was worth every penny!
They ran out of duck breast bacon for the Farm burger on a Sunday during lunch. That was disappointing, also the egg was small. The farm burger and chanterelle burger were very good. The Pig burger was thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly, but overall seemed under-seasoned. The Parmesan  fries were good, but the ration of potato bits to whole fries was too high. Maybe we should've asked for a new order. The service was great. Overall, 3.5 stars.
I am not a 1 star kind of gal, but this place deserves it. A nearly two hour wait (though there appeared to be room), unpleasant hostesses, extremely bland food, and a strange behaving waiter, all conspired to an unenchanting evening wasted on this place.
My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay, so it was a must that we try his restaurants when we visited. The burgers are quite pricey here, but definitely worth it. We came here twice during our stay in Vegas and both times, the service & food was amazing!. . On both occasions, we had a 15 - 20 minute wait. Others may have to wait longer, but it is worth it.. . We ordered the Farm Burger & Hell's Kitchen Burger along with a few sides. The meat melts in your mouth. I would suggest ordering med-rare with a side of jalapeno poppers & truffle fries. They are to die for!. . You will not be disappointed. If I am ever in Vegas again, this will definitely be a stop I will have to make.
This place was pretty good.  Great lighting, bunch of tvs for sports, decent food and the price was relatively cheap considering it is in Las Vegas.  I got the farm burger and it was pretty good.  It's hard for me to say a burger is amazing because in the end it's a burger but it was well made and very good.  The fries were terrible though.  It was dry, plasticy, and not very tasty.  The onions rings were pretty good with the cheddar cheese ranch sauce.  What made the meal great was the milkshake.  I'm not big into milkshakes but it was by far the best I ever had.  Texture was perfect in which it was not runny or too thick to drink through a straw and it was a good balance of not too sweet and not too foofy (considering it's a trendy place).  I'd go back here again if I'm in the area.  I'm not sure though if I would go out of my way to come here if I was staying at a hotel/casino far away on the other side of the strip.
Burger was good. Not mindblowingly amazing but definitely "good".. Now the truffle fries were "GREAT." Don't forget to get it.. . Had to wait over an hour to get in for dinner around 5PM on a Sat. The wait wouldn't have been as bad if they had told us it would be an hour instead of 30 min.... . Went with a group of friends but overall a good experience.. . Good to take friends, date, coworkers, family, and customers
This is my 3rd visit and the food is great.   Jalapeno poppers are awesome. . . My rating would be 5 stars if they would correct the way they do the waiting list.    They have a way to text you when the table is ready, which is great.   The wait was around 45 minutes.   We received a text saying our table is ready, only to go to the counter and have them tell use they are still setting up our table.   We waited 20 more minutes along with around 5 other groups that were texted. . . Please do not text unless the table is really ready.   Fix that problem for 5 stars.
Went for dinner last week. Wait was an hr and a half so if you don't wanna wait forever get your name on the wait list early enough to have dinner at the time you desire. The hostesses were very nice and sat us at a great table. The menu isn't huge but it has exactly what you need for a burger place. Now this is a gourmet burger joint so if you're looking for something extra fatty and greasy this is not for you, although you can get a classic cheese burger. I went with the triple cheese burger which had a bunch of fancy white cheese on it. Really great. Be aware when you're ordering that fries do not come with the meal so you will need to order them on the side. After the meal we enjoyed some push ice cream pop. Cake and ice cream in a push pop. Simply the bomb. Overall great experience and friendly staff. Again plan ahead if you want to go to Ramsays novelty restaurant.
Love Ramsey. However never eating here again after being told they cannot accommodate for a table of 9 while they had plenty of space and tables to seat us. They even had a table of 8 eating at the time, they said the extra person is a fire hazard?  I guess pulling a 2 top next to the 8 top is physically impossible. Rude hostess, embarrassing situation. was not handled professionally, especially for the way Gordon would have handled it.
Excellent char-grilled burger. Delicious toasted bun. Add spicy asadero cheese and peppers and you have one hell of a burger.. . In fact, almost everything on the menu has a  consistent fiery flavor. I guess it matches the flaming decor.. . The steak fries (Just Fries) were great, especially with the spicy ketchup. . . Jalapeno poppers were good, but I would prefer the dipping sauce be served separately. . . Great food. Great service. Ramsay has another hit on his hands.
I was so glad that my cousins and I got to try out this new burger or should I say burGR joint in Vegas!. . I came with a party of 6 and at first, we were dismayed by the LARGE line coming out of the front (still have no idea what that line was for) because we walked to the front and instead of waiting in that line, the hostess took down my number and said they would text in ~a hour when our table was ready. We walked around the shops and not even 30 minutes later, received a text that our table was ready. I appreciate a restaurant that does not tell you the wait will be 10 when it's actually 30, so for the wait to be LESS then what they told us....brownie points to BurGR!. . Items Ordered:. - Roasted Jalapeno Poppers. - Sweet Potato Fries. - Truffle Parmesan Fries. - Shake #4 . - Hell's Kitchen Burger. - Farm Burger. - Euro Burger. . I love a place that cooks a burger the way you want it and you could tell the meat was quality meat - juicy!!! I personally loved the farm burger for it's ooey gooey egg!. . Everyone loved the food, the staff/service (did I mention that the servers leave a iPad that you can browse their whole drink menu on?).. . I would rather pay to eat GordonRamsay's BurGR than Umami any day!. . :)
Fans of Ramsey so we couldn't wait to try it out. There was a line but it moved fast and we were in within 10 minutes. . . Once seated our waiter came right over and was super nice. Had an iPad to view the menu which was awesome. Then told us we could keep our paper menus for souvenirs. . . Our burgers came out within 30 minutes and we ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Euro Burger.  The burgers were both absolutely delicious. Unique in their own way and couldn't have chosen a better place. At $14-16 per burger it was very reasonable for Vegas and we'd definitely go back. Nice Job Gordon!
Fantastic fries ..., but the Farm Burger was flavorless & dry. It should be renamed the Farm BoreGR. The famous Farm was totally not worth our 30-minute wait in line.. . Luckily, a Hell's Kitchen Burger was much better ... thanks to add-ons of Duck Breast Bacon and a Fried Egg (both of which are on the Farm BoreGR) which complimented the Hell's Kitchen Jalapeno, Tomato, and Avocado.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries (Lunch $10) . ... featured large Potato Cuts that were exhilarating without the normal oiliness of French Fries. The flavor blend of Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli was Truffletastic. Of course, at $10 you'd hope these were better than your normal burger joint fries ... and they were. (4 stars) . . Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13) . ... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes. It would of been 3 stars except we added, for a few $ extra, Bacon and a Fried Egg. (4 stars with add-ons). . Farm Burger (Lunch $14) . ... was probably the most hyped burger on Yelp; however, despite the goodness of Bacon and ooze of a Fried Egg, this was a dry blah disappointment. Olivia wanted to return it, so, I gave her half of my HK Burger. If you get the Farm BoreGR add Avocado and Jalapeno Peppers to add any flavor. (2 stars). . Batch 19 Beer ($7). ... Bold and hoppy like Gordon Ramsay himself, this Coors-brewed Pre-Prohibition Style Lager helped take the edge off. If I go back to Gordon Ramsay ... and there is no line ... then I might just plop down in front of one of the TVs and relax with an order of the Fries and this brew.. . With a slow wait and overpriced BoreGRs, the cool factor for Gordon Ramsay BurGR isn't enough to elevate this burger joint among the elite food destinations in Las Vegas.
Tried to go twice, first time has 1.5 hour wait due to not enough staff at 11:30 am..... Second attempt was 1 hour wait even though there were plenty of tables available.... This is Vegas Gordon! Too many other choices than deal with your lack of service!
I had high expectations for this place, what with Gordon Ramsay's face plastered on all the print advertisements on the Vegas Strip and all.. . In short - it was okay. Food was okay. The Farm Burger I ordered was just an overpriced, average burger with a fried egg in the middle. The burger was small, especially considering how pricey this place is. We shared the truffle fries with everyone, and they were just that - simply fries. . . Thankfully we went right when itopened on Saturday morning, so there was no wait at all. If I waited as long as the other reviewers had (1-2 hours?!), I might have thrown a fit.. I would much rather save the money from this meal for a buffet.. . In-N-Out is way better. Too bad there's none on the strip in Vegas. :(
The beef in this burger is amazing. I had the Farm Burger and let me tell you with each juicy bite my taste buds were exploding. I simply didn't expect that feeling when eating a burger.  A definite must try!. . The one thing to note is that the truffle fries and sweet potato fries need some work. They are okay but clearly overhyped.  Check this place out. There's a line but worth the wait!
With Gordon Ramsay Resstaurants, you either love his style or hate it. I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and his style of cooking, I tried their Hell's kitchen burger and I have to say Its simple but delicious. The service was really good and Their cocktails were reasonably priced. The food for 2 with 2 drinks and a fries came to about $45 which is not bad for Vegas. The fries and sides are separate orders.
I was super excited to come to this restaurant, especially since I'm such a big fan of masterchef and gordon ramsay. haha. Anyway, I ordered a farm burger and had regular fries and onion rings as appetizers. The burger was good - very juicy and well cooked, but I just felt like something was missing. I still enjoyed it, but I guess my expectations were a little high. The fries were fries, the onion rings were onion rings, pretty normal, but I loved the dipping sauces that came with both. They made the fries and onion rings taste amazing. I also had a milkshake (the one with oreos),  and it was SO GOOD...probably the best milkshake I had ever had. It was, however, almost $10, so i kind of expected it to be something special anyway. . . All of their burgers are around $14-$16 dollars and their fries and milkshakes are all about $10. I went with my family as a party of 4 and we waited about 45 min. The service is good, the waiters are all friendly and smiley. . . Overall, I really enjoyed the experience at this restaurant. Will probably be back again the next time I go to vegas to try something new. . . Note: The restaurant is in the Planet Holleywood hotel, the very first restaurant when you walk through the entrance of the Miracle Mile Shops.
I have eaten here on several occasions, once as a carnivore and once as a vegetarian (I am apparently a fan of weird, sporadic diets).. . For vegetarians, the Earth Burger did not disappoint. Once I finished the burger, I did not have a craving for meat, which is always a plus.. . For the rest of us, you cannot go wrong with the Farm Burger during your visit. Sure, the burger is very hyped up on Yelp, but it is still very tasty if you like eggs on your burgers.. . If you choose to order fries, the parmesan truffle fries are by far the best. I think I liked them more than the burgers.. . Surprisingly, the desserts are very tasty too, especially the push pops. I highly recommend them, and the shakes did not disappoint either.. . Beware: a burger and fries will cost you about $30 (without a drink). This place is delicious, but you have to ask yourself if it is $30 delicious or not. I prefer Bachi Burger to this restaurant, but it is still a very good burger option on The Strip.
***Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a solid burger spot and a significant notch above the other celebrity chef-backed Las Vegas burger restaurant I've been to (Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place)***. . Burger restaurants (or maybe a sandwich spot like Earl of Sandwich) on The Strip might be your best option for a satisfying meal that does not cost you an outrageous amount of money.  A lot of the restaurants on The Strip (even the 24-hour cafes) charge a ridiculous amount of money ($30-$60) for just okay entrees.  With an upscale burger restaurant though, you are going to pay $10-$16 (maybe high but not outrageous) and get just as filling of a meal and maybe even a more satisfying one (since the total bill will not reach the fine dining-like prices of many Vegas restaurants--even casual ones).. . I have not been to many of these Vegas burger spots (I hear Holsteins in The Cosmopolitan is popular).  I have been to Hubert Keller's Burger Bar, which is not too expensive but it is also not as good as it used to be.  This was my first visit to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR (located in Planet Hollywood) and it is relatively new.  The burger was good; hopefully, the quality does not go downhill as the restaurant ages.. . Gordon Ramsay BurGR has a simple menu.  It ditches the build-a-burger concept (smart move since this often results in an abundance of mediocre ingredients); instead, Gordon Ramsay BurGR serves a little over 10 restaurant-designed burgers with many different types of flavors and ingredients as well as different patties (a lot of beef but also a portobello mushroom option, chicken burger and pork burger).  A few salads and typical barand grill appetizers (like chicken wings and jalapeno poppers) are also available.  Various fries are offered in sharing size and there are also a few dessert-like shakes on the menu (that integrate cookies and puddings).. . I had the chanterelle burger and it was good.  I really liked the bun.  The bun was soft, but it also had a distinct and toasted edge (so many upscale burger restaurants are putting burgers on grocery store-like buns).  The sandwich consisted of a thick eight-ounce beef patty, arugula, chanterelle mushrooms, and a sweet fig and onion jam.. . The beef patty was great.  It had a good sear and a good flavor.  I ordered it medium rare and that is exactly what it was--some red in the center and very juicy.  I really liked the arugula and the sweetness of the jam was not too much.  The chanterelles were great, but there were not too many of them and this premium ingredient was kind of lost in the sandwich.  I think a good strong cheese would have made this burger better and there were parts of the burger that did feel a tad greasy.. . I also tried their sticky toffee pudding push up pops for dessert.  It was a fun dessert--push up pops consisting of alternating layers of sticky toffee pudding and salted peanut ice cream.  The sticky toffee pudding layers were very thin and lacked the signature moistness and stickiness of that dessert (kind of expected given the structure of this dessert).  The sticky toffee pudding flavor was there though.  The salted peanut ice cream was creamy and not icy, but it really just tasted like vanilla ice cream.  Still, it was a fun dessert to eat.. . Service was very good.  The hostesses and my server (Alex) were very friendly and attentive.  Alex was very passionate and eager to please (but in a very genuine way).  Service seemed organized and the food came out at a quick pace.. . Gordon Ramsay BurGR has good lighting so that you can see what you are eating but not to the point where the restaurant is too bright.  It is a big and contemporary spot and quite loud (I am not sure about all the decorative live flames integrated into the restaurant; it is the kind of non-essential decoration that a lot of restaurants ditch later and then you are left with an odd, empty space).  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits open to the casino so depending on where you are sitting, the cigarette smoke from the gaming floor might be very disruptive to your dining experience.. . Prices are good.  Burgers are in the $13-$16 range, but they are very filling and the flavors and preparation of the burgers are much better than a mediocre $40 steak at one of those 24-hour cafes on The Strip.  Total Rewards members also receive $1 off most items on the menu.. . Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a great and not too expensive option for a satisfying and unique (but also not bank breaking) lunch or dinner on The Strip.  Hopefully, it does not fall into the trap of other celebrity chef-backed restaurants on The Strip where the quality standards drop as time goes on.. . I have never parked here, but I imagine Planet Hollywood offers free self and valet parking like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip.
Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a prime example of everything that is wrong with a modern restaurant.   Start with the staff, horrible.  They text us when our table was ready (I like that idea), however when we arrived to be seated we had to wait another 15 minutes while our table was getting ready and we were corralled several times to get out of the way by a bunch of scantily dressed host staff (kids).  The atmosphere, loud and annoying.  The food, even worse.  Start with greasy fries and the worst dipping sauces, mayo but not mayo for the Europeans, and catchup but not catchup for the Americans.  Both sauces were terrible and the fries dripped with grease.  Next the onion rings were even filled with more grease and the batter didn't stick to the onions.  You had to eat them with a knife and fork and the sauce was another disappointment.  A good dipping sauce for onion rings is chilled thick ranch dressing, sounds simple but very few places provide a good ranch.  The stuff they served here was so bad I could not eat it.  Next was the shake or what they called a shake.  It was more of a parfait concoction with various flavors but it didn't resemble a shake in the slightest.  When you are craving good old ice-cream forget ordering this crap, it isn't even close.  The only good thing about the shake was the cookie.  Finally the burgr, another huge disappointment.  Rather small but thick and undercooked.  My wife cannot eat red meat so she ordered hers well done and of course it was completely red in the middle.  The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again.  When you consider paying an average of $35 for a burger, fry and shake the price is insane and what you get for that price is criminal.  Never felt so ripped off before.  I love the food channel and enjoyed watching Gordon do his thing on TV but this restaurant has changed all that.  I have zero respect for this marketing fool who is selling overpriced garbage.
Went here with my brother while we were in Vegas.  Stood in line at 3 pm with our parents, no one took our names or said how long the wait would be.  Line seemed to be moving well until we got to the front then they told us it was an hour wait. My parents decided to eat later so that we could eat at the two seats at the bar ( I had to be back at the airport and could not wait the hour)  That was a little disappointing that I couldn't eatwith them.  I got the Uber cheeseburger that was good and Shake #3  was absolutely killer.  My brother got a plain cheeseburger and fries.  You had to pay extra for the fries.  Once we were seated service was just average,my brother had to flag down the bartender for another coke.  I think you are better off going across the street to Holstein's, they are just all around better.  I really wanted to like this place a whole bunch since I am a big fan of Gordon... but I thought it was just average at best.
impressed.  burgers were solid.  went with a buddy and after we each finished our burger, we ordered another to share as our dessert.
Long wait to get in. Most of us got the farm burger which was good. We also got regular fries and truffle fries. The truffle fries with the aioli sauce was delicious! Service was great because the waiter was quick with everything and water was constantly refilled, almost after every sip. Definitely a bit pricey for the amount of food you get but that should be expected.
The only time I've had a burger and didn't once consider adding ketchup because of the flavor being so good without.  Also hardly any grease great texture.  Lived up to my expectation and beyond
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100. . My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!. . BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.. . We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.. . The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.. . Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.. . We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P. . My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!. . As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.. . When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!. . Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)
Having always wanted to try one of Gordon Ramsay's Restaurants I finally got to do so on my last trip to Vegas. Because we didn't have much time we decided to eat at the bar since we were able to get right in if we did. There was a long line when we arrived which we thought was just to be seated and ended up being just to put your name on the list. Be prepared to wait if you decide to eat here. The bartendor was very nice though and you can order anything off the menu at the bar. I decided to go with the plan old cheese burger and fries. The fries are sold ala cart so be sure to order those or you will just get a burger. My burger was prepaired perfectly. It was juicy and the bun was very fresh. I really liked the multi grain buns they had great flavor. The fries were also quite good but what really made them was the homemade ketchup. It had a bit of kick to it and I don't normally like Ketchup on my fries but thought this was exceptional. Cost to eat here is high for a burger place also. Was over $30 a person for a burger. Over all one of the best burgers I have had!
My hubby says 2 1/2 stars and it was only for the ambiance, not the food. I think I have to agree! I've been to his steakhouse and was happy with my food there, so I was expecting some good food, especially with all the reviews. Sadly I have been excited to try this spot for a long time and I finally did. It was very packed for a week night, around 6 p.m. When we left, there was actually a long line forming. Upon first entering, I was really impressed by the fire lining the window as part of the decoration. The hostesses were standing around, greeted us, and took us right to our table. I was surprised how busy it was in there. There are huge TV screens covering the walls (sports bar-ish but with high price tags), loud music (Vegas all the way), and Gordon's pic all over the place, on the menu, on the wall, everywhere. At first I was very impressed with the whole thing. . . When we sat down our waitress Tammy came over and appeared to be a in a big rush. I ordered the Farm Burger, Hog Burger (love thename), and we got Maui Onion Rings and Truffle Fries. The burgers we got were supposed to be their speciality, so I was really expecting something special. Ummm the Hog Burger was not memorable at all. I can't say I enjoyed it one bit and almost felt like I was just eating it because it was so darn expensive!! ($17 with being a rewards member). The burger wasn't even that big and it just barely had any taste. The toppings were arugula and some sort of sauce, again nothing memorable. The Farm Burger had a nice piece of bacon on it, cheese, and an egg (doesn't sound original but in comparison to the Hog burger, it was decent). I really don't feel like with the high price here for the burgers, these burgers were worth the price. I hate to say it, but the burger was borderline dry. The Maui onion rings and garlic dipping sauce was tasty, but nothing that would bring me back to this restaurant just for that. The truffle fries were thick cut fries and had an overwhelming truffle taste, almost to the point where you felt gross eating such oily fries. . . I am glad I went and tried it and now my curiosity is over and I will not be back. With the Ipad menu, Iphone for giving feedback/review along with the check, and all the TV's, I think the high price of the food was going towards the gadgets instead of good quality food.
I had high expectations for burgr since it is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and I love burgers. Service was great, I had a party of 9 and they sat us right away which I thought was amazing. . . Waiter was very descriptive and encouraged us to try the HOG burger. More than half of us did..... And more then half of us got sick later that night . . Coming home some of us check our bank statements to tally up our weekend come to find out that 2 of us had been double charged on our accounts from burgr. . . If you like great service, food poisoning, and incorrect charging of the bill I recommend "burgr" . . . . . . . Tangent: I hate to write a bad review but it practically ruined our Las Vegas trip. we all got sick, tried to figure out the cause and that was the only place we ate at. And to add salt on the wound over charged.
I would say the burger I tried here was average compared to other burger places I have been to. That being said, the price for what you get is GREAT, especially considering the prices at some places in Vegas, not to mention this is a GR restaurant.. . We waited about 30 minutes for a table for two. The jalapeno poppers are great...we didn't realize this but 1 of the 6 they serve has an extra spicy surprise inside... unfortunately I got that surprise and my mouth was on fire for most of dinner! We each got the Hell's Kitchen burger... and warning...the jalapenos are HOTTT! I picked mine out, and the burger was still tasty. The bf ate mine and his and said it was crazy hot but delicious!
4 stars because it was absolutely delicious and worth it to try. . 4 stars because the wait to sit was ridiculous and the service (although she was sweet) took foreverrrr. I would recommend trying it though, at least once!
Just visited Vegas this New Year and also was residing at the Planet Hollywood. After a great Experience at the Gordon Ramsay's Pub Last July at Caesar's Palace my girl friend and I decided to try this Burger Joint. The place looks great the service was good. We ordered two of the recommended burgers from the menu but what I found to be an awesome drink is the Oreo Shake with creme brulee pudding. I highly recommend that. My opinion of the Burgers is that it was too dry even though they recommended we do the medium well. I don't know if Mr Ramsay comes over to check up on the quality of the food at this joint but he should come and see if they are up to par. As famous as he for quality and presentation is was not the food I was expecting for the price you pay for a burger. The Fries was great. Would I go back and try it again maybe....
Not one for long reviews. This place rocks. Onion rings were FANTASTIC. Fries were about an 8 and the burger was maybe 7 1/2 out of 10. Great service and holy crap, the desert.....Oreo Shake was the best.
I have now been here twice, both times being consistent. It's better to come for lunch or odd hours because this place can have quite a line outside sometimes.. .  The burgers come out pretty quick, done exactly the way you order them and are thick and super juicy. They have an impressive amount of beer on draft and always ice cold. There's also a good amount of tvs with sports on, if that's your thing. Make sure to save room for one of the pudding shakes. I've never had anything like it and the pudding the milkshake is topped with is probably the best I've ever had.
Overall good quality food. I think I was just expecting a little more from Gordon Ramsey. . . The restaurant itself is nice as all restaurants are on the strip. We ordered the onion rings with parmesan and truffle oil, and the two housemade sauces. For burgers I had the farm burger with the egg on top and my boyfriend got the classic. The ingredients were fresh (avocado etc), the patties were generously portioned and perfectly cooked to our liking. However the farm burger could have used a lot more seasoning. With Gordon Ramsey always being so tough on people in his shows, I was a little disappointed that the burger was lacking something as simple as salt. . . The waiters presented the drinks, desserts, and restaurant merchandise on an iPad, which enabled a more high impact display. While that was nice, it didn't seem that the high top table we sat at had the space to accommodate. Additionally the rest of the food items for the menu were on a separate print copy, and you couldn't order the drinks or desserts using the iPad. Perhaps they are still testing how they was to integrate the technology, but we just found it slightly piece meal and confusing.
Amazing burgers and sides. Order the jalapeno poppers and you get a spicy surprise with one of them. Truffle fries are amazing not greasy at all. And the burgers....well you will mop the grease off your plate with your fries.
The burgers, fries and wings are excellent. Shakes are amazing. All of the food is well-prepared and delicious. Service is outstanding! If it's good enough for Gordon, it's good enough for you!
I was so excited to eat, what I'd hoped to be an amazing burger, inspired by the world famous chef Ramsey. But I thought the entire meal was mediocre and underwhelming. . We started with jalapeno poppers and onion rings. I will say it was the beat part of the meal. In fact the onion rings were the best thing I tried.. Now, getting down to the burger business. It was a difficult decision. My girlfriend and I decided to split a Euro and the Homestyle. Both of our husband's went for the Hog. We all ordered them cooked to medium. There was no consistency in the temperature of the meat. The colors ranged from red to pink. The husbands both complained that the Hog had an Asian type of flavor going and were not impressed. I was afraid to eat my half of the Homestlye because it seemed undercooked. The Euro was OK, but still not mind blowingly good. Finally, the fries came with 2 kinds of "fancy" ketchup. They both tasted the same and chili powder was a main ingredient.  . Also, reservations are not accepted so expect to wait a while for a table.
For Vegas and The Miracle Mile,  this ia the best quality to cost around. Shakes are more gimick than taste though.  Fries and the burger are the way to go. Oh, im a huge fan of cheddar based poppers, but was not impressed with these (tough they sounded good).  I like more crunch out of the breading.
I ordered the truffle parmesan fries, coffee milk shake and the Euro burger. As soon as the waiter brought out the fries, I noticed how limp and soggy they were. There were a faint truffle smell and delicious grated cheese on top. The aioli and ketchup were probably the best part about this item. But the fries themselves, gosh, I really really wish they were better!.  . The Euro burger wasn't bad although for $16 a burger, it should have been a lot better. And the coffee milk shake, I really enjoyed the light and less viscous part of it. Whatever they put on the top dark layer, it was too thick and sweet for me.. . Maybe I should have gone to Gordon Ramsay's other restaurant at Ceasar's instead.
Solid 4 stars, despite the 30 min+ waiting time. And as the name implies, this is a burger joint. Don't expect anything more and you'll enjoy your experience immensely.. . My friends and I wanted to catch a late lunch so we hit up BurGR for some grub. Looking at the reviews, we were eager to try this place. Overall verdict: super glad we did. . . As for ambiance...? Psh forget that. It's loud, lively, and bright. You've got flame displays, large TV screens, and bright red booth seating, all the makings of fun chow down session.. . But let's not linger. Down to the food: . . To Share: . * Roasted Jalapeno Poppers ($12) stuffed with cheddar bacon, served with cheddar ranch. . . SO GOOD. This was probably the best of the four appetizer/sides we shared. Crispy crunchy outer skin, molten cheese on the inside, spicy kick from the jalapeno, more cheesy goodness to dip in. Mmmmmm yum. Not to mention, you get to play Russian Roulette because one of the poppers is extra spicy. May the odds be ever in your favor. ;). . * Beer Batter Maui Onion Rings ($9) topped with shaved parmigiano reggiano, served with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip. . . If you like onion rings, this is the appetizer for you. Greasy goodness, extra crispy flaky outside, soft onion ring on the inside. I loved the chipotle ketchup but that's because I'm a ketchup slut. . . * Sweet Potato Fries ($9) with vanilla powdered sugar and served with a honey jalapeno mayo.. . Eh... this is where taste falls short. My group collectively thought it was too sweet. I thought it just lacked some "umph"... personally found it flavorless. . * Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) which are hand cut and topped with truffle parmesan and truffle seas salt, served with a truffle aioli.. .  Perfect marriage of umami truffle flavor, starchy potato and cheesy parmesan goodness. Second favorite side ever. . . *Shake #4 ($9) which is an oreo shake topped with a creme brulee pudding and an oreo cookie.. .  Delightful. Two people in our group shared it and it was as good as it sounds. You can ask for extra spoons and cups, and the restaurant will give them to you. YAY! . . --. . To Each His or Her Own: . * Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14) made with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. . . Friend said it was a good standard burger. It looked darn delish so I believe him. . . * Chanterelle Burger ($16) made with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam.. . Mmm... I was a little disappointed. The burger was solid, the taste was great, but the texture was off. There was no crunch factor, and I was just looking for something to offset the mushiness. Mushrooms were earthy, albeit chewy, the arugula was crushed under the bun so it was a bit deflated (and I wish it added a more peppery bite to the burger), and the figgy-onion jam just fell short. When you tell me the burger will be served with a figgy-onion jam, I want to taste fig and I want to taste caramelized onions. I barely taste either because the whole burger just sort of melded into one without fully highlighting each ingredient. :/ Hmm...and it was overall too oily for my liking. Could barely eat the thing without grabbing a napkin every so often to wipe my wrists and mouth. . . * Farm Burger ($15) made with duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. . . Awesome. I took a bite out of friend's and it was basically a homey vamped up version of a breakfast egg-muffin. Comfort food in the form of a burger? I'll be ordering that the next time we're here. . . Again, very solid burger place. Total price came out to be ~$30.00 per person with tip and tax. Not too shabby Mr. Ramsay.. .  I shall return.
Gordon Ramsay Burger is not your usual burger place, it fit well with the vegas strip.. . Amazing sweet potato fries, those were some of the best I had ever eat, it mix with vanilla powder, and the fries below of the cone were not as tasty and a bit overcooked.  Our group orders two burger, the farm and hell burger.  The burger was probably 1/3lb, there not big but just about right if you eating solo.  The buns were sesame both side; first time I see this in a burger bun.  It reminds me like those sesame bagel.  I was not a fan of those burger bun but there were definite unusual, the hell burger were supposed to be very spicy, so I told to lower the spice.  The spice level came way out very weak and defeat the purpose.  . . The service was good, refill water quick.  However was annoyed by their keep trying to sell us the dessert menu.  The food is good but not worth the price tag, since this is the strip is not a bad deal, despite burger cost $15 and fries were almost $10.  After all Subway nearby cost as much $10 for a foot long isn't such bad trade off.  The check comes with a ipod with a thank you message from Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant atmosphere was modern inside, but the attraction is the big frame display of the restaurant. If you hungry.  If you are very hungry, better off goes to buffet or something, this however is a great  mid night meal after a club or a show.. . Tips:. Bring you total reward card, it save you $1 from any items in the menu.
Disappointing. We both ordered the Farm Burger due to it's reviews on Yelp. Both found it dry and bland. Had Gordon Ramsay been critiquing it on a show, he most certainly would have sent it back. Seriously, you'd think a master chef would know how to use some seasoning. I had a better burger at Carl's Jr on Highway 15 on the way to Vegas. . The Parmesan Truffle Fries were very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. Served with delicious homemade ketchup and another type of aioli. . . The milkshake was pretty good. Actually more like a cup of half milkshake half pudding. But still pretty good (and maybe even $9 good). . Overall we were disappointed with this place, not worth the money and not worth the line. . . Burger: **. Milkshake: ***. Truffle fries: ****
On our last visit to Las Vegas my wife and I ate here twice.. . Since we were a party of two, we had to wait in that line that's in front of the restaurant - the wait wasn't too bad, we waited 30 minutes at 9pm.. . We got seated and the server was informative and welcoming. The menu is cleverly folded and the decor is nice.. . Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - These were probably the best poppers I've ever had. They're on the spicier side but the filling, sauce, breading are all awesome.. . Parmesan Truffle Fries - The aioli they serve it with is amazing, be sure to ask for extra. The fries are alright - because they're steak fries you get a lot of potato with every bite. Not a huge steak fry fan.. . Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - Absolutely amazing - my favorite onion rings (like them more than Phil's BBQ in SD). . Fury Chicken Wings - Sweet and spicy wings - more on the sweet side. Very tender and moist with the outside skin perfectly crispy.. . Euro Burger w/duck bacon - This burger was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and all the toppings complimented each other. Easily my favorite burger.. . Hell's Kitchen Burger - This burger was pretty awesome.. . Farm Burger - It was alright. Get the Euro or Hell's.. . Shake #4 creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. Shake #5 chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake. + praline cookie .  - The shakes were incredible. Pudding with your shake? Best idea ever! . . I've had my fair share of burgers over the years everything from Rustic Canyon Burger @ Rustic Canyon, the Rossini @ Burger Bar, Umami, Father's Office Burger, all the usual suspects for best burger around. Gordon Ramsay - you just took burgers to the next level. The Euro burger is my absolute favorite burger of all time. I only wish I could get it here in LA. Everything at the restaurant tasted amazing!. . tl:dr. Euro Burger - the best. Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - the best. Truffle Aioli - the best (on everything). Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - the best. Shakes - the best
It's not terrible. It's also nothing special. Perhaps when you live here, you loose the awe most seem to find in celebrities.. . BurGR suffers from the same maladies as all the other $50 burger joints on The Strip do. Very slow, very expensive, overworked and (I'm sure) poorly paid staff.. . The menu has some interesting variations on the theme and surely one of them will be to your taste, but we've found nothing so positive that it justifies putting up with the negatives.. . This is just another celebrity carpet-bagger here to suck some more $$ while the gray train is still running. It's really a shame because Las Vegas is the place where it can be done right.
The best burger joint in the whole country, I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie, I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that. the Parmesan truffle fries. it is pricey but it's worth it. I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger. his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries.
After reading the Yelp reviews, we stopped by here and got some jalapeno poppers, beer and burgers. The burgers were really good, so was the beer. But two things stuck with me:. . 1. The milkshakes were just out of this world with the pudding on top.. 2. When the waitress set the jalapeno popper shots down, she very casually mentioned "Oh, and one of them is extra spicy, but it's a surprise".
Top tier Burger joint. Highly recommended.
Oh Gordon, you should really check out your own restaurants.  I was about to start yelling at your staff for you...... . Husband and I wanted to try out Gordon's burger place.  I mean, his show is "Kitchen Nightmares" so this place should be running like a machine, right?  Haha. . So we show up probably around 3PM on a Tuesday.  As I walked up to the hostess and greeted her she proceeded to unscrew the cap of her water bottle and take a drink before greeting me.  I did not walk up mid-unscrew or mid-sip, I was standing there and THEN she opened and took a swig.  This is not something I would expect from Gordon's front of the house staff.  Once she greeted us we were promptly brought over to a table  (the place was pretty much empty).  . . Our server came over and gave us an ipad that listed drinks and desserts.  I ordered a skinny tangerine cocktail, husband had the gin cocktail (I cant remember the actual names but they were off the cocktail menu). It took a bit for us to get them.  Mine was sweet and really pretty much a glass of ice with a little cocktail,  I finished it quickly.  Throughout the meal I had a gin cocktail and husband had another gin cocktail.  . . We ordered our food and waited.  After about 15 mins our server came over and said "Your food will be out in a few minutes".  We were not asking about our food after 15 mins, he offered this info.    We continue to wait.   We saw other people get there food and finish it.  FORTY minutes after we ordered our food arrived. FORTY MINUTES.  For two burgers cooked medium and a side of fries.  And oh yeah, no apologies for the wait.  On minute 30 I was ready to go over to the kitchen and start yelling Gordon Ramsey style, all throwing plates and calling the staff donkeys.  They weren't even busy.  This wait was unacceptable.. . Finally got our burgers and fries.  We had the Hells Kitchen Burger, Uber Cheese burger, and Parmesan truffle fries.. . The food burgers were very good, not the best ever, but very good.  I liked that they weren't super greasy and were actual cooked medium.  The uber cheese burger was best in the middle of the burger where all the cheeses were mixed together.  The Hells Kitchen burger was good.  Not consistent throughout, different bites had different flavors.  Some was spicy, some wasn't.  Fries were good, by no means mindblowing.. . Overall, food was good, wait was unacceptable, skinny cocktail all ice, no booze - oh and all this cost $96 before tip.  If you read my other reviews you will see I am not a stranger to a $100 meal, but this just wasn't worth it.  Wont be making a trip back when I'm in Vegas again.. . To break down the 2 stars:. Food - 4 stars. Wait - 1 star. Value for money - 2 stars
As someone who lives in Vegas, I have been meaning to go here for the longest time. Delicious. I expected nothing less from Gordon. The only thing I didn't like were the dipping sauces that came with my fries, but that was more of a personal preferences on taste. The wait staff was extremely nice and helpful with the menu. The price is not that bad considering it's on the strip and it's Gordon ramsays name. Would recommend to anybody.
As soon as the UFC fights were over, hubby and I were hungry! I didn't have a chance to read the Yelp reviews about this restaurant but we had a wonderful time at Gordon Ramsey's Steak so this place couldn't be bad, right? As a celebrity chef made famous by being going ballistic with other restaurant owners for bad food, service and decor I have heldhis restaurants to a very high standard.. We had arrived and were seated promptly. Always a plus! I got a chance to see the different seating arrangements: Tall tables with bar stools, comfy lounge chairs at intimate seatings for two and booths. We were sat at the intimate table for two and I immediately sank into my chair. I came up to the table a little higher than my chin. After a few minutes it didn't matter because the chair was so relaxing. The yummy cocktail, Goodbye Blue Sky, was fruity luscious! . We had been waiting some time to our server, Daisy, was able to get to us, but she did stop to recognize us and apologize for the wait. Appreciated the acknowledgment. She took our orders and got back to whizzing around her other tables.  . The place was busy with a few open tables, but when the Shania Twain show let out there was a long line and a lot of people at the bar behind me. Always good to see a busy place and it gave me a chance to people watch as I waited for my food.. The food: We split a Caesar Salad. It was made with butter lettuce instead of Romaine and I missed the crunch. The dressing was made without anchovies. What?! That's so ridiculous!  If you don't like anchovies, don't order a Caesar Salad! And it was overdressed which  also added to the limp factor exacerbated by the use of the more leafy lettuce. I had mine topped with anchovies, but it wasn't the same. Disappointment. I had the Fish and Chips while the hubby had the Shepard Pie. The fish was crispy on the outside and steamy, flaky fish on the inside. I requested the fries be extra crispy, but the slices were thick, so most of them weren't crispy. To be fair, I know that it's difficult to fry a thick slice crispy without burning it so I let let slice. It was ok, just limp. Hubby's entree disappeared before I finished, so I can only assume it was delicious! His father was a cook (and a fabulous one at that!), so when I asked how it was he just said, "OK" Thank so the detailed description, but the empty bowl pretty much says it all.. I paced myself and didn't eat all the fries, so I was ready for dessert. I ordered the Toffee Pudding and hubby got the Spotted Dog. Both desserts were awesome! Both tasted freshly made and the sauces were so good! Our server poured the sauces over our desserts, but there was some extra bourbon sauce on hubby's that he poured into his strong French pressed coffee. Now this is how to end a meal!. When we return, I will definitely try the Beer Flight with my meal!
I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it there! We waited about 30 min to be seated on a Saturday for lunch but it was totally worth it. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and it was soo delicious! Loved it so much my husband and I went back the next day to try their hot dogs and jalapeno poppers! Would personally go back for burgers and truffle fries!
This place was one of the best places I have eaten a burger in a long time. Needless to say thats a given considering who owns it. I had the coffee milkshake #5 and I could drink one of those every day! My american burger was good and the jalapeno poppers were amazing. If your ever on the strip, stop in there. Some guy tried to bribe the girls at the front desk to let him in before others who had waited way longer. He tried 10,20 and 50 bucks before he finally got the hint that no meant no!!
Well I can't really say anything seeing as I wasn't able to get in. I know they do not take reservations and it is walk in only. I tried calling to see what the wait time would be and nobody answered the phone. I was transferred to hotel concierge who wasn't able to get ahold of anyone either. So far not a good impression. I'll try again another time
My experience at Burgr was positive with the exception of a few things. Let me start by complimenting the interior, it was contemporary and comfortable. The menu was very simple and detailed, definitely a plus. My friend and I had a few things on the menu. The truffle fries were divine, then again truffles can make anything amazing. I highly recommend their truffle fries! The steamed pork buns were very mediocre. The pork was tougher than I expected it to be. The burger though, flawless! I had the euro burger and it was really good. It's definitely something I would come back for. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and every component complimented each other. They also had a good selection on beers, which is always a winner! Their customer service was not the best though. Every time they would take our food to us, the would put another guest's plate (even our drinks) to make it easier for them to put our down. Trays exist, maybe they should look in to getting those. When they would take our empty plates, they would slam an empty plate from another table on top our empty plate and take both plates. It was very unethical and such a turn off. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu but seemed bored and put off a vibe like she had better things to do. Again, such a turn off. Overall, it was okay. It's not my favorite but I would definitely come back (for those truffle fries. yum)
Great burgers with an English twist.  Pudding shakes are amazing and a must order.  Cheaper prices for Total Rewards members, so you can apply for a card for free when you enter the casino.. . But if your idea of an awesome burger is In-n-Out or Fatburger, save your money and go somewhere else, like In-n-Out or Fatburger.  These establishments are in a totally different category so it would be unfair to compare.
Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a must try dining experience if you are in the Las Vegas area!  I would recommend calling ahead though because the wait time for walk up reservations is ridiculous.... the burgers are good but not waiting an hour and 30 minutes for one.  That being said it is probably, in my opinion, top 3 Burger i've ever tasted in Las Vegas. unlike the line of people wrapped around the casino floor I made a reservation and was shown to a table promptly. Our server was polite, informative, and speedy when it came to initially starting our table.  The wings he recommended are amazing, just the right amount of kick and fit the appetizer bill to a T! (delicious but not overly filling) I went with the Hells Kitchen Burger for my main course, it has to be one of the most flavorful burgers i've had the fortune of tasting! So many different flavors then an delayed heat blast... wow! worth every penny!
My favorite burger in Vegas, hands down! I just returned for a second helping and it wasevery bit as amazing as the first bite. I can tell that the place has gotten a lot of great press as the line is 10x the size it was on my first visit. Grab a seat at the bar or if you have a players card you might be able to get bumped up in the line. Service is amazing, craft beer list is surprisingly good and the top-notch meat is simply prepared, grilled over a wood fire and is paired perfectly with just two or three additional ingredients to add up to a near-perfect well-rounded combination. Do yourself a favor and order medium rare or medium at most. Try the truffle fries, the onion rings or the stuffed jalapenos. Sounds like some basic burger sides on the surface, but they'll likely be the best representations of each you've had in a long, long time.
I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants and BurGR did not dissapoint! The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious. Come early if you want a seat because there is always a wait!
If such a thing is possible, the truffle fries were over-truffled.  Blue burger was great though.
Everything was amazing, well, except for that one thing the whole restaurant is designed around. Everything else though: amazing.. . So there's a line that wraps around this place to get in. They don't take reservations but they will allow you to wander all over the Planet Hollywood after you've put your name down; so come with some shopping priorities.. . Once you get in you appreciate the Vegas Pomp of the place. The walls are made of fire, the drink menu is an iPad, everyone who works here is more attractive than us normies and the jeans are Gordon Ramsey BurGR brand. It's a strip place and yet the prices are very reasonable for it's location. Then again, it is the planet hollywood.. . The liquid refreshment is exemplary: margaritas were top shelf, I had beer on tap I've only seen on tap at high end specialty establishments. Great stuff. The fries came with ample dipping sauces (ketchup/mayo) and were spectacular. Unfortunately.... . The burger, which was the Pork burger, was dry and relatively mediocre. The waitress recommended it as a favorite, and maybe it is, but it had like four dry ass ingredients and did not inspire me. I was taken aback. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. It was roughly backyard BBQ quality, and I was hoping for something special.. It may have been just my burger. . . Overall a great experience, but choose your delicious cow murder carefully.
Get the farm burger! This place is one of the best burger places in Vegas and I'm a local. The line to wait for a table can be long but goes by fairly quickly. Try the truffle fries too!
Came here because I am a huge Masterchef fan. . . Ordered the honey-pig bao buns and the jalapeno poppers as an appetizer to share. Both were really good, the honey pig buns were huge and are basically like mini banh mis with the bread you get when you order peking duck at Chinese restaurants. Excellent "burger" appetizer. Super yum! The jalapeno poppers came with 6 pieces, and they were big. I was already getting full after the appetizers I ordered the farm burger-- which had duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar, and a fried egg! I should've split the burger with someone because I didn't finish it. Tasted my friend's truffle parmesan fries, which were amazing as well.. . Although my waitress forgot the shake I ordered, I was happy because because I wouldn't have been able to drink it because I was stuffed!. . The outside of the restaurant is a cool fire display.. . Everything was super delicious, just a little pricey!
Having shows dedicated to improving restaurants & capitalizing on their venue & food, I wasn't doubting that the food/experience was going to be anything but short of AMAZING!. . The entrance is hard to miss as it is literally on fire. lol. . . The hostess could use a little professional etiquette classes. We made reservations 2-3 times over the phone because they lost our reservation 5 mins after making it when we called back to change the time. . . When we got there, they told us to wait & we did for 10 mins then finally after observing that there was a ton of open seating available my friend went up tot he hostess podium & asked how much longer it would be & all 3 of them (all girls) looked at her like "you guys were waiting?" smh. GR - it could deter customers if your hostesses are clueless, FYI.. . I ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries which was a big enough serving for me. So yummy! I had a little bit of my friends Sweet Potato Fries with honey jalapeno mayo dipping sauce & it was BOMB! YUMMMMMYYY! Recommend for sure! The containers the fries comes in can be taken out of the metal holder & you can just walk the strip while holding the fries. "On-the-go!" . . I also ordered SHAKE #4: Creme Brulee Pudding.Oreo Shake.Oreo Cookie.. OMGOMGOMG, HEAVEN! 'nough said. Try the shake & it'll speak for itself.. . All my friends got burgers & I swear their burgers were PERFECT, my friend said they looked like crabby patties, lol.. . The attire states "business casual" but you can go casual for sure. . . They have a photographer that comes around & takes pics that you could potentially buy. We passed.. . The waiter we had didn't like that we didn't tell him in advance to split the check. Gave a little attitude but whatevs. . . The FOOD definitely saved this review because the service wasn't up to par.. . Just sayin'
PHEW! Gordan, you made up for yourself. You might be saying to yourself, "Made up for himself?! But it's Gordon Ramsay.. he can do no wrong in the kitchen!" Well, you probably haven't tried his Pub & Grill at Caesar's. Anyway even after a horrible experience at one of his other restaurants, I'm very pleased to say that BurGR has made up for it and I can see myself returning in the future -- definitely would have to be a 'treat' day.. . So you sit, take a look at the menus that are already placed on the table, and the server comes by with an iPad with the drink selection. They encourage you to play around with it for descriptions on their drinks, but I must say this PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU AT LEAST HAVE HAND SANITIZER. Not that the iPads were covered in filth or anything, but I mean come on let's think about this for a second. iPads that have been passed around all day, everyone swiping away on the iPad screen, and then it comes to you and you mess around with it a little, and roughly about 20 min later comes your burger that you pick up and eat with THOSE SAME HANDS. It's Contagion waiting to happen people!. . Anyway that's probably the only negative thing I have to say about my experience here. The prices aren't too bad, about $13-$15 for a burger. Seems like the range of prices for a burger at any other restaurant, like Cheesecake Factory or something. What is a bit on the pricey side is the fries. Sweet potato fries and parmesean truffle fries are about $9-$11 each. But I have to say, SO WORTH IT. I absolutely loved the fries! The truffle fries take a shape like a rectangular wedge but has the texture of a skinny fry (does that make sense lol?). I'm usually not a fan of sweet potato fries but I honestly couldn't get enough of both! They come with a side dipping sauce that honestly tasted like thick creamy butter -- I really hope it wasn't butter, cause then I should be at the gym instead of writing this review. One order of fries can be shared amongst 2-3 people. As the main course, I went with the farm burger like my fellow Yelpers suggested and it was nothing short of absolute deliciousness. Still, the fries stole the night. And of course, we completed the meal with a shake. I chose the #4 shake - creme brulee and oreo. I honestly could've done without it. It was just too rich and sweet for me, and definitely does not make me feel any better after the 1000+ calories consumed already.. . The service was just OK. Our server wasn't very attentive throughout the night, but we were all catching up and entertaining a 3-yr old that we didn't pay much attention. Hahaha the waitresses are all these tiny petite girls in some tight uniforms and it doesn't make you feel any better with a shake in your hand...or a burger.. or fries, but whatever I'll eat for the both of us! :). . If you have a Total Rewards card, don't forget to bring it! $1 off all items!
The burger was very basic nothing special. I would not spend my money on this burger I recommend In N Out for the money and quality.  Ps. The onion rings are the best I ever had by far. They are crunchy and good. The service was great , quick easy and fast. But what I said, the burger is not worth the cost and wait...
There are hundreds of burger joints in Las Vegas by famous chefs, franchises, and local families, so standing out takes a lot of effort--and a lot of taste.  Gordon Ramsay's BURGR bar is one of those places that is on travelers' bucket lists for Vegas eats, as well as some locals.  I decided to give this place a chance given my love for Hell's Kitchen.  . . There is a long line to get in to the restaurant, one that any patron must endure if they did not make a reservation.  The line is 30-45 minutes long depending on what time it is.  The nice thing about standing in line is the amazing flaming sign that is stare-worthy for about 30 minutes.. . . . The flames keep patrons warm while waiting in line, but on a summer day, this could be annoying.  Still, it is unique and is a great conversation piece.  It makes patrons wonder what is on the other side, and if the food is as intriguing and sexy as the front entrance.. . After 30 minutes, we were finally seated in the main dining area right against the other side of this sign, and thankfully it was not hot to sit against.  The menu is simple and consists of appetizers, burgers, sides, and desserts/shakes.  We ordered the Brittania (mango chutney and sharp cheddar) and the Hell's Kitchen (jalapenos and gouda) burger.  To start, we went with the most unique option on the apps list--the banh mi pork belly app.. . . . I did not expect to see this on the app menu at BURGR, but technically, it kind of is a burger if you consider burgers to be meat in between a bun. The pork belly was well seasoned, melts in the mouth, and the richness from the fat is cut by the pickled radish and carrots.  The bun, though, was lacking.  It had good flavor, but it was a bit dry and not as fluffy as it should be.  Still, the taste was there and it was a nice way to start the meal.. . When the sides and burgers arrived, we were quite excited.  They were 4" in diameter and served in a bun that held up to the juicy patty.. . . . The britannia has caramelized onions, a mango chutney, and a sharp cheddar with arugula.  The toppings were amazing and the patty was seasoned well.  The buns held up to the patty, having that bounce back to it.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and juicy, salty and a bit sweet.  I cannot say the burgers were terrible, because everything tasted great, but neither are burgers that I dreamt of the next day.  Gordon Ramsay has his reputation for a good reason and his food is very good, but I wasn't too impressed.. . The patty was great and cooked to a perfect medium, which I loved.  Overall, a nice burger but the toppings made it yummy, not the meat, which should be the main event.  The fries were served with a curry ketchup and a spicy one, which both were good.  I love steak fries and could eat these all day.  The fries are crispy on the edges and baked potato soft on the inside.  I love how perfectly fried they were and how large each fry was.  The winner of this visit, however, was Gordon Ramsay's sticky toffee bread pudding--push pop style.. . They layer the pudding with the ice cream and it is sticky, sweet, and creamy.  I could eat four of these for dessert despite the richness of each pop.  I love the whimsy of the push pops.  Ending the meal with a fun dessert made the entire experience a positive one.. . Service was just as lovely as the food.  Our server was outstanding, friendly, and helpful in every way.  From watching Gordon Ramsay on television, I expected excellent service, and this restaurant delivers.  From wine lists to dessert, our server cleared our table all the time and made sure we had everything the way we wanted it.. . Overall, BURGR was a nice experience but a place that will be the first to come into mind when I'm craving a gourmet burger.  Although the food was good, it wasn't memorable in any way, except for dessert.  Maybe I am picky or one that cannot be satisfied easily, but BURGR will not be on my "regular eats" list.  Still, it is worth a try and gave me the right to say that I've eaten at a Ramsay restaurant that was on television.  In the end, I think that's what BURGR is all about--bragging rights.
It was my first 'Gordon Ramsay' restaurant I visited.   I was satisfied with the food but not the service...  . . A friend was visiting and wanted to try it so I was in!  There was still a line around 1:30.  They said it would be about 25 minutes to wait and actually only ended up being about 5 minutes.  Nice!  Our waitress was over right away for our drink orders and give us a chance to look over the menu.   There were so many unique creations and I wanted to try them all.  My friend did also so we ended up splitting two of the burgers ~ The Hog Burger with added bacon and the Euro Burger.  Of course we had to get a side of the sweet potato fries.  The fries were large enough to split so I wouldn't suggest one order for yourself.   We had ordered both burgers medium and they came out perfect!   The Hog Burger had a fabulous combinations of flavors with the bacon, pork and apple butter.  The Euro Burger topped with goat cheese and oven roasted tomato sent my taste buds into overdrive! Both were simply delicious!   Maybe it's strange to some people but I wanted ketchup for the fries.  The are served with jalapeno mayo and it just wasn't cutting it for me.  The waitress looked at me like I was nuts.  Ok but it's my weird choice.  Dessert?  Why not? We split the sticky toffee pudding push up pops.  These were just ok. I wouldn't really recommend them.  Overall I really enjoyed the burgers!. . Service was just ok.   I had showed my card for the discount on our food before ordering.  When the bill came, it showed the regular prices.  I asked her about the discount.  Again, she looked at me like I was crazy and said I never showed her the total rewards card.   I just think there was a better way of saying she forgot and not blame the customer.  . . Yes I would go again when in the area and keep my fingers crossed for better service.
First time visiting a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. My friend and I figured after seeing his shows and ratings as a chef that his employees and cooks would be at a different level. Definitely not! . . Wait - No wait at all very prompt to get our table. . . Pre-Ordering food - Our waitress showed us the drink menu on an iPad (pretty cool) and gave us enough time to make up our mind.. . Ordering food - I asked specifically if the Damnation Chicken Burger was spicy and if I could have it with a normal beef patty. Our waitress said it had a good kick considering it had "fiery hot mayo". I love a good spicy burger so I ordered that. We also got truffle fries, onion rings, and the farm burger. . . To start we got our food in a decent amount of time, slightly longer than expected but nothing to bad. . First my onion rings never came. I asked when they dropped off the food and it wasn't our waitress who dropped off the food. The women said she'd go ask them to make them but they never came at all. . The truffle fries (which our waitress said were "well worth the few bucks extra, they are so much better) were a huge disappointment. When it says "truffle Parmesan" and "truffle salt" they mean they lightly sprinkle it on the top of the normal fries and charge $3 extra.  Solid tasting fries but we wanted the normal ones and she really pushed us to get truffle fries and they weren't worth it at all. . My burger was the damnation burger. It had no spice at all! I don't know if they forgot the "fiery hot mayo" or what but it was bland. It had no flavor at all. Realistically the bun was the only part that was good. If the burger was spicy like promised and had a little more flavor it would've been nice but honestly you get more taste from Carl's Jr. I would never, ever recommend getting this burger. I asked one of the guys working there if it was supposed to be spicy he said yes, and asked if it was to hot for me. I said no, it had no spice at all and he quickly back tracked his comments saying it's only supposed to be a small but noticeable kick. 1 out of 5 stars burger which is incredibly disappointing. . The farm burger wasn't much better. The burger patty itself was dry and it didn't have much flavor. My friend asked for Ketchup and some of their "cheesy ranch" or whatever it's called just so he could dunk the burger in it to add some flavor. We had to ask three (3) times just to get a side of cheesy ranch as well. About 10 minutes after getting it another waitress we asked came and dropped it off and saw that we had already got someone so she basically dropped it on the plate and stormed off, rude. . . Now not everything was terrible one waiter or busboy in particular was prompt, helpful and overall did his job well was named Joey. Not sure on spelling but had to ask his name, if anyone from Burgr management actually reads this review he was the only bright spot in an overall terrible experience. We spent about $48 on food and service that was more worth about $15 or less.. . Honestly Ramsey should start paying attention to his own portfolio of restaurants before filming tv shows about fixing other peoples restaurants.
Food was really good. I ordered the "hells burger" and my boyfriend ordered the "farm burger"  it's loud and really busy in there. Customer service was excellent. To me the food did seem over priced. Our tab was $75 for 2 burgers, a side off fries, a salad and 2 drinks.
One word...PERFECT. . . We started with the jalapeno poppers & the Maui onion rings. Excellent start. The poppers are filled with cheese and bacon & the onion rings had the perfect breading consistency.  . . I ordered the farm burger, and my group shared the parmesan truffle fries. The one order of fries was plenty to share with my group of 4. (maybe because we were already stuffed from the abundance of great food).. . Overall I was thoroughly impressed with both the staff and the food. I just wish I had room for dessert! Will definitely be back.
The burgers were in fact absolutely amazing as was the fish and chips!! I had a banana pudding and oreo shake which was also very good.. . The only issue I had with this place was the waitress outfits, the placemats oddly enough, and the chair height. Sounds nitpicky I know, but this is why I couldn't give it a 5 star. . . The waitress outfits were a short skirt onesy that is stitched is a way that is awkwardly unflattering. This sounds really rude but I kept glancing at the mid sections.. . The placemats were a really thick leather that I kept felt like I was sticking to and couldn't maneuver the items on the small table around. I justput the on the side of the bench seat and fixed that issue.. . Lastly the chairs are really low to the ground. As I looked around everyone was eating and upper chest level and my knees popped when I got up after dinner.. . That all said the food is absolutely outstanding!
