Excellent Beer and pub food.Great prices and service.A casual atmosphere.What more could one ask for?
Ok...what's so unique about this place?. If you are a big fan of micro breweries and like big freakin tanks carry the beer then you may like the place even more.. . It's quite spacious, somewhat expensive, gives feel of a normal bar except for the fact that they you can see big distillation tanks. . It looks like the place was made out of the unused space from the brewery based on the fact that its not quite symmetrical( who cares).. Good variety of beers and food.
You would think that January 1, the day after New Year's Eve, would be a pretty quiet day at a pub, but I was pleasantly surprised when I came here for dinner a few nights ago.  This place was definitely hopping, thebeer was flowing, and it was a great place to watch some important college bowl games.  I loved the look of the giant beer silos, or whatever they're called.  It made the place look like a factory.  I sat at a table next to them and stared at them the whole time I was there.  . . The food in this place is also really good.  I had the peach beer.  I don't exactly remember what it's called, but it was just the right mixture of beer and peach flavoring.  The quesadilla appetizer was extremely cheesy, which was nice, but the cheese masked the taste of any of the other ingredients that might have been on it.  Although, the salsa that came with the quesadillas was excellent.  It tasted like fresh, home-made salsa.  My date and I shared the 12" vegetarian pizza, which was packed with toppings.  I'm usually not a big fan of gourmet pizza, but this was one of the better ones I've had.. . Overall, this place sort of reminded me of BJ's.  Good beer, good appetizers, good pizza.  This was also a nice place to watch football.  I would have given this place five stars, but the parking situation outside isn't very convenient.  I had to park my car on a dirt lot behind some random building next door.  It didn't feel very safe, and it takes away from the dining experience when you have to worry about the safety of your car.  . . I spent about $40 for a very nice time at this restaurant.  I would definitely come again.
The staff here is all friendly!! They know their beer well. I had the peach ale and it was awesome. Nice and fruity. They offer a flight where you can try all their beers on tap. The food is also really good here. Portions are huge and prices are fair. I ordered a Caesar salad and it was enough for four people to munch on. The soup of the day was ham and split pea. It had a lot of meat in it, very hardy. I came with a group of 12. This place is huge, so Its great if you are with a group, they are very accommodating. Really nice brewery, however we were unable to get a tour because we came in the late afternoon. Everyone raved over the pasta salad that was served as a side with a lot of the sandwiches. I also heard that the garlic cheese and beer bread was yummy. Great hang out spot!
Above all things, I love microbrews. Four Peaks treated us well, and when I say well, I mean goood. . .     This layout goes on forever. When you walk inside (past the nice patio area) you weave through, side-to-side, and all over the place. There is so much seating and it adds to the brewing atmosphere. We sat closer to the back, near the actual factory area, where we could have played darts if the mood had struck us. Instead, the mood to have a "flight night" did. . .    We both ordered the sampler--eight beers, roughly 2 pints worth (or a little more) of Four Peaks beer. Before our samplers came out, our awesome waiter also brought us three beer shots of their seasonal beers-- a Poppin' Pilsner, Chocolate Mexican beer, and a hardy Barley beer that was a little much for my taste--but at 12% alcohol content you can bet I was feeling a little toasty after that. .   .    Along with our beers we ordered food--my friend got the French dip after much debate and loved it, while I opted for the Garden burger with beer fries. The jalapeno sauce made this burger spicy and even more delicious. The Peach beer that they brew, along with the Kilt Lifter, were my two favorites. . . After pigging out on beer and my burger, I was stuffed and ready to go. But you can bet this is a great place to watch sporting events, have a fun night out or grab a casual meal!
Came here last night, and between the pitcher of Hop Knot - which is probably my favorite local IPA and the salmon BLT - it was an evening of excellence.  I'm far from a seafood snob, but I have avoided it for the most part since I moved here from Seattle for obvious reasons.  But their blackened salmon BLT might be my new favorite sandwich in town.  Perfect seasoning, fresh veg and one of my favorite beers to wash it down.  If you haven't tried this sandwich and you're even a small fan of salmon, add this to your list!
This place is fantastic, especially when the weather is nice enough to sit outside on the patio.  The beer selection is good and has some of the more flavorful ones I've tasted.  I had the Pizza and their wings which were good, if not a little pricey compared to most bars, but tasted great.  Will definitely be coming back.
Yummy food!  Even the water was the best I have ever tasted.. We had the spinach dip to start, amazing. For dinner I had the chicken fingers and . my hubby had a steak. We will be back!!!
What a great spot to hit up on the first night of a business trip!  Even for a Monday evening, this place was pretty packed, and now I can see why!. . The service was really great and attentive, without going overboard.  Our waitress made sure our beverages were never wanting.  She also did a great job helping out a member of the group that was not as into beer as I am.. . Speaking of the beers, I tried a pint each of the Kilt Lifter and the Raj IPA.  The Kilt Lifter was fantastic, a great example of Scottish Ale, with a great malted flavor and some nice undertones of subtle fruit.  The Raj was a real nice IPA, with the nicely bitter hoppiness that I look for, without being overdone.. . Food was also real good, and in more than generous portions.  Great flavors all around that went nicely with the fantasic beers.. . Overall - I want to bring Four Peaks home with me, as it is a great establishment that I will make a stop every time business brings me through the area!
love Love LOVE this place! They have such a variety of beers but house my all-time favorite beer Four Peaks Peach Ale! If you are just visiting town- this place is a MUST! The beer is amazing and their food is delicious. Burgers are awesome. My favorite thing to eat there is the Chicken Salad Pita and the yummiest pasta salad I've ever had! The only few downsides are parking can sometimes be an issue and there is often a wait- so get there early! Can't wait to go back!!
Good food.....good beer! And great pumpkin spice beer (if you get it while it's in season). My only complaint it's that it gets hot  inside in the summer.
Everything on the menu is delicious, try the beer sample! The salmon BLT is my personal favorite with the pesto sauce. Their artichoke dip has a different flavor than most that I've tried but very good.
The perfect place to spend an afternoon. Great patio. Fantastic local beer. Good food. All at the optimal price to quality ratio. For a sandwich, try the salmon blt.
Not often does any place get the full 5 Star treatment, but after our trip this weekend to Four Peaks,,,  I had to fold.... . BEER - Kiltlifter awesome, awesome awesome.... . . Appetizer - Panko Crusted Calamari - Best Calamri I have ever had.. This isnt the kind of Calamari that you taste only the batter, but nice Strips of Squid that isnt over cooked or chewy, but delicate n the batter is delish as well, but can definitely taste the squid also, and the spicy Marinara was ok, but the Jalepeno ioli or aioli stuff was wonderful as well.. . The Lunch - Swiss Mushroom Burger cooked to order /Med Rare - done just right, even asked for extra mushrooms on side (no extra charge). . . We have been here a few times for their Sunday Brunch as well, and everything we have tried has been very good.. My Fave is the Breakfast Beer Bread. . Enjoy, n post your findings as well !!! Cheers !
Winterwobbler coming soon. No, you cant get a pitcher and you cant get a growler. It knocks you on your kiester.
So impressed! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and although we had to wait about 20 mins for a table it was well worth it. The beer was really good and the food was great. Our service was really good too. Can't wait to come back!
Most amazing burger I've ever had in Arizona, haven't been back since I was an ASU freshman so I never got to try the beer but I'm sure it's equally amazing, get anything here you won't regret it
