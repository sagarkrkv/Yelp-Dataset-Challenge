We found this place on Yelp, and after visiting, it's obvious that the ratings are well deserved. The French Toast is amazing. The Greek Omelet was fantastic. The service was great! We love it so much we went back the next day!
Having read the past reviews, I find it funny that some people have actually said that they got "tricked" by Yelp.. . I'm a local, and Mr. Mama's has been one of my go-to spots for brunch for a while now, and I leave happy every single time. The service is excellent, and I've never been disappointed with the food. Have you ever tried their hash browns?? They're always on point. I haven't tried any of their sandwiches though. So if you haven't ordered anything from the breakfast menu and you think that this place is 'okay', I say give it another shot!
Delicious.  Server was super friendly.  Owner came by during the breakfast and greeted us.  Coffee was really good.  The food came out in good time and hit the spot.  All 4 meals that my group had were filling and hit the spot.
If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Food was amazing, price was very reasonable, and the service was the best I've had in years. I had the Mama's Short Stack and it was the perfect amount of food and so delicious. My drink was never below half full and the staff makes you feel welcome and like family. Another plus is the bathroom was immaculate. So happy we decided to stop here on the way out of town. Will be coming back and referring my friends here!
Great food! I was in the area and stopped in bc I read the reviews before. They were totally spot on reviews the food was amazing I had the Greek omelet it was so good so were the potatoes! Yum. I don't live close to here but I'd make the drive. Staff is super friendly too! Definitely recommend!
I'm so impressed!!! The food and  price is excellent. The customer service is great and the owner is very friendly. He checked us in and later came to talk to us. Also, we sat by his favorite picture and he provided us with a bit of history information on how the mafia was connected to his family history. We will definitely come back again!
Perfect if you want down home cooking.  The pancakes were fluffy, eggs were perfect and the customer service was awesome!
Went here based on the reviews for lunch and found the food and service very average. Had clam chowder and BBQ beef. Both were average at best.
Friendly staff.  You can feel the love of the family that runs business.  A kind man helped us with a sturdier chair for my colleague who needed a more comfortable chair.  Had a work meeting there.  Food was so good that I took my local friends there that following weekend.  Funny thing is, I was the out of towner taking them!  They loved the portion and customer service.  Will definitely make it my hot spot to eat when in town.
We make an effort to stop here for breakfast every time we come through Vegas. Mr. Mamas staff is always at the top of their game. And the owner is always present and making sure the service is perfect. The food is stellar for an excellent price.
Wow....the word is out. Good , solid, reasonably priced food with terrific folks giving good service with real appreciation for your biz. What a concept!. . Seriously, we have been coming here since they opened and I kinda miss the quiet days there but these folks deserve all the business they are bringing in. congrats on your success and will def be back for breakfast.  Note to self....try lunch.
A great little breakfast spot!  Wonderful service!  Breakfast served all day and reasonable prices!  Hacienda Hottie Approved!
In town from MD. Ate breakfast here 2 days in a row. French toast was great. Eggs taste fresh and delicious. If this place was near me, IHOP would never see a dime of my money! Omelet is 4 eggs minus all the useless filters. Hubby had the pancakes, also good. Today I had the Cali omelet. Loved it. Home fries with peppers and onions, really good. They are sliced like like lime pieces. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. They remembered we were here yesterday! If I lived here, they would know me by name! Great food and a breakfast for 2 people plus drinks only $23.
This place reminds me of Surf Shack on main street in HB. Breakfast is the focus and the pancakes are amazingly fluffy and light. Lucy had the french toast it was great. Service was great and a nice relaxed atmosphere reigns. Be prepared to wait but you will get hungrier and I bet it will taste even better, which is how I felt. Nuttin fancy. Just good home cooked food.
Went to Mr Mama's 2 days in row during our stay because the homemade gravy is the bomb diggity! The staff is super nice and attentive. Great diner breakfast!. . Check the daily specials hidden behind the Pepsi fridge!
Had a late breakfast here around 1pm. I ordered pancakes. .which were absolutely delicious. . Very fluffy and buttery. I also ordered their breakfast burrito... I've had better ones at local albertos, but it was ok and very filing. . . Hubby ordered the 1lb burger..I took a bite and it was juicy and yummy. The rest of my group ordered other random stuff and they said they all liked it. . . The restaurant is located in the outskirts. .nearby corporate offices. Not a very far drive from Mandalay Bay (since that's where we stayed at) definitely a good spot to eat brunch on the way back home to cali.  . . Price is affordable. It won't break the bank especially if you're down from gambling. . Lucky we werent! Hubby and I even picked up the tab for all 7 of us.
Just found our go to breakfast place. Fresh and yummy food with friendly great service. Portions are not super-sized, but plenty to fill you up. Had the chicken fried steak plate and the steak and eggs from the daily specials. Chicken fried steak was fried to a nice crunch and the gravy was as amazing as others cited. Steak was a rib eye of about 6 ounces and had a nice flavor. The standout thing was Nick, who greeted his customers andhandled the seating courteously, setting appropriate estimations of wait time, and was a gracious host.
Awesome place, service is great and they are very friendly. Food is great and very affordable. Highly recommend. !!!
Good food and prices, great atmosphere, outstanding customer service. . Located in a light industrial park, not where you'd normally look for a Great breakfast food joint. . Mr. Mama himself, Nick, is a gracious and gregarious host taking great care of his employees. This is telling in the excellent CS. . . We came at the end of the breakfast rush MLK morning. The place was packed with a 15 minute wait. But once seated our server was taking our order within minutes and food arrived only a few minutes later. . . Had Mama's Special, classic pancakes eggs and bacon. Pancakes are why we came. I loved the taste and texture but my wife likes them crispier on the outside and fluffier on the inside. Said the batter was probably beat too much.  Coffee was too strong for me but if you like Starbucks you be right at home.
Great food, great service, fair prices.  What more can I say?  Real sliced ham steaks, perfect pancakes, and well seasoned eggs make this place exceptional.  My wife's omelet clearly was made with fresh ingredients. I felt that the employees really cared that I received good service. I will definitely return when I visit Vegas again.
I would eat breakfast here over the buffets in Las Vegas any day. The service is impeccable and the food tastes just like home. All of the staff are incredibly friendly. We were greeted by the owner when we arrived and once he learned it was my sister-in-law's birthday, he made sure she got one of his special cinnamon rolls which was DELICIOUS! As was all of the food we ordered. Can't wait to go back the next time we're in town.
Nice family run restaurant with well cooked food. Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Affordable, GOOD breakfast.  We opted to stop by here on our way out of town instead of eating at our hotel's buffet.  I'm so glad we did.  . . It was Monday morning of the holiday weekend, so it wasn't a surprise to have to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4.  I observed that the hostess seemed to be a manager or supervisor of sorts; she was on top of every thing that was going on in that place.  . . Turns out our server was fairly new, and the hostess did ask us for any feedback on her performance.  Later one of the guys in the kitchen came out and made the rounds asking everyone how everything was for them.  It was evident that they really wanted everyone to be happy.  I really appreciate that.  . . I had the french toast, which was delicious. I wish the bacon were more crisp, but it wasn't overly flimsy; Ijust like mine extra crispy and I would've ordered it that way if I'd thought about it.  But it was Monday after a long weekend in Vegas.  . . Food was very good, but the commitment to service is what stands out for me. I'll definitely go back to try other things on the menu the next time.
The owner Nick is awesome.  The service is friendly and top-notch, the food comes out fast in humongous portions.  I have no complaints and will make this a regular stop when I'm in LV.
Outstanding and inexpensive.  The owner is the most efficient manager. Outstanding service, large portions, everything they do is super great.  I usually ate breakfast in Vegas at Peppermill which is world class, but this place deserves the same outstanding acclaim.  This is my new place and rivals Peppermill at half the cost
Very friendly staff! Food was out in a blink of the eye and was what's to be expected from a small and quick breakfast establishment. It was quite a hike from the main drag, but worth the trip for a quite family style breakfast away from the hustle and bustle.
Best breakfast off the strip! Great food, good prices and excellent service! And it's smoke free! Would come back for sure!
Great food and service! The owner actually goes around and makes sure that everyone is satisfied! We ate at a few buffets but this definitely surpasses them! Best we had out here on this trip :-)
Late breakfast before heading to the airport. Our waitress recommended the Cali omelet which was delicious, we had it w home fries & a biscuit. Great service - the staff works as a team so you never have to wait to get water or anything else. We finished at noon & the place got packed out for lunchtime
2 of my buddies and I went here before a round of golf...great breakfast place!  3 Big thumbs up!  Great fresh food!  Great friendly and prompt service!  Try the pancakes they're big and awesome!
We just ate here and I was really impressed. It's a basic American breakfast with really good Midwestern prices. We both had big breakfasts under $15 including the tip. Everyone was so friendly and made sure everything was tasting good and we had everything we needed. I was really pleased and I will be going back. Someone names Nick came to our table and introduced himself, told us they would try to make it a pleasant breakfast. He even held the door open when we left :)
Clean and good service!! Found this place with the yelp app and worth the drive from the strip!
