Love love love. Probably my favorite place to party in vegas. It's really big. Lots of room to dance. Hip hop and edm rooms. Great view. Great outdoor area with a pool. The only thing that sucks is the stairs. At least at hakkasan they let us take the elevator.
Marquee was my first Vegas nightclub and it was definitely a wonderful experience.. . My friend was able to get us in on the guestlist (by us, I mean the girls. Guys had to pay $20 or $30 for pre-sale tickets). . . There are a lot of stairs involved in Marquee that lead to different floors and music rooms.. . We started off in the hip-hop room which played really decent music but it was so crowded. We tried making it to the dance floor but ended up giving up and dancing on the side by the door near the balcony.. . We then made our way up to the EDM room where Gareth Emery was performing!!! I didn't know he was going to be there and it was AWESOME seeing him. The room was not crowded at all. But the security guards were kind of mean and pushy. I understand that they are trying to do crowd control, but geez. He kept telling us to keep moving when I was trying to make it to the dance floor to watch GM perform and I ended up getting pushed elsewhere.. . Drinks here are expensive and half the size. But, what can you expect in Vegas.. . I had a good time and would love to come back.
LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. . Marquee is similar to XS. The layout is similar - circular with tables surrounding the dance floor. Like XS, Marquee also has an outdoor pool area. However, XS is more spacious and more hmm... I guess posh is the correct word.. Dash Berlin was performing the night I went to Marquee - it was awesome. Happy days! . If you like hip-hop, you can chill in the outdoor area. . I was surprised that they had tables outside - my friend ended up playing the night away. . The crowd is alright - there were LOTS of Asians. The hottest chicks are the dealers at the tables. Haha. Drinks were good - slightly pricey.. Lighting is great - confetti, lasers, smokes.. Overall it's one of the nicer clubs. You won't die of hyperthermia in there. Just make sure you book a room at the Cosmopolitan - that way you won't have to walk back barefoot to whichever hotel you're staying at when the partay ends.
I really like Marquee and I feel like I am picky when it comes to night clubs. I went in December so there was a tent over the outside pool area which made the club huge, thus I liked it. . . Good music and plenty of space to roam. The line didn't move all that quick but what do you expect?
Went to the hip hop club upstairs this time and had a great time. Best club I've ever been to. Definitely coming back here on my next visit. Hit up Danny Trejo for VIP service.
Marquee has got to be one of my favorite clubs in LV. . . I've never has a bad experience because most of the time I have a great promoter that usually hooks up with a efficient experience. Marquee is located in the beautiful Cosmo hotel. That hotel is one of the prettiest hotel I've ever visited. From the lobby to the entrance, the chandeliers and the shimmering tiles make the hotel so elegant. The rooms are pretty awesome as well. Super clean, and you don't smell the cigarettes. . . On to da club. I enjoy this club is because it is big. There are three different floors. 1. The EDM floor where there is a big DJ that spins. This is the largest floor with tables and bars that extends. There is also a big patio area that leads outside where there are other tables (I am guess this is where more affordable tables are.) The decorations outside are pretty fancy as well. There is also a hiophop floor. We all have that friend that doesn't dig the whole house music. You guys don't have to split the clubs up! Just split floors. The other floor is the mini bar floor where the bougie folks who enjoy chatting it up without the grinding or the unce unce. . . Girls usually never have to worry about drinks because it's Vegas. They are practically treated like princesses. But guys, I am sorry. Vegas is where you have to roll deep with the bands. I am assuming that guys usually have to pay about 15+ per drink or shot. Bottles can range from 4K-10K (?) . . Entrance and Guestlist fee. I highly recommend getting in contact with a host a promoter so you he/she can cut you a sweet deal. Party Safe!
If you like to be treated like a herd of cattle and feel like a sardine then by all means go but the rude as heck bouncers who are a bunch of mindless dip sh*ts  and the over prices with little chance if actually get a drink I think this place is garbage
Oh Marquee, I do hope we get to play again soon. . . This is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas, day or night.  The dance floor is usually wayyyy too crowded for me (I'm miniature, I get claustrophobic!) but luckily the outdoor area is just as fun.  . . I've been here several times, some with a cabana/table and some without.  Like all Vegas clubs, spring for the table if you can, but I still always have a great time here.  I do think it's especially fun for day parties, but I'm down to come back at any time!
PICTURE THIS: Colorful flashing lights and laser beams, random shots of air blasting down on the dance floor, and best of all: a shit ton of silver and purple confetti being blown everywhere enough for it to fall in places you wouldn't thought possible. (Yes, I've gone home with confetti in my bra.). . With all these special effects, this place makes me feel like I'm starring in a sexy music video.. . Yes...dance floor is small. Yes, it's always freaking crowded. There's always gonna be pervs trying to hit on you. But it's MARQUEE!!!!! Still one of the more popular nightclubs here in Sin City. As long as you're with good company....your night will be a blast!!! Doesn't matter whether you get bottle service or just dancing anywhere and everywhere you can find a space.
This club does not even deserve I write exactly what happened because it's a waste of my time all I will say the Guards are racist and this is very sad. Minus well go elsewhere and have a wonderful time where this does not exist!
Fun house music from the dj. Confetti, raining dollar bills, laser beam light shows. Good times. Consider talking to a host or table service to avoid lines. Drinks are expensive but it's Vegas and a club so just expect it.
Stayed in the cosmopolitan, not only did I get to go in for free but I gotta skip the huge lines as well. :) Dj politik was performing, he started Spinning  at 1130 and then stay throughout the whole night. It was a blast! Confetti being bursted every 30 mins, cold air blast on a crowed dance floor perfect!  Bartenders are friendly, 15 dollar drink average but were nice ladies. Oh and if you are going to complain about no room, obviously you are no baller who can not afford table service. Enjoy life, dance elbows with strangers, I don't care if people are stepping on my feet, and if I step on yours no worries, I'm wearing flats. :P I'm there for the music and dancing.Overall great experience and if you are drinking, if you don't want them spilled just drink them at the bar. :P
Trance, electro, deep house, and progressive all live here.  One of the premiere clubs on the Strip, Marquee will guarantee you a great time.  1,2,3, LET'S GO!. . Located inside the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, Marquee has been one of the stand out clubs to grace the Sin City.  Lights, drinks, pools, dancing, and a good time are what you'll find in Marquee.. . We went around 10pm on a Friday night.  Luckily we ordered bottle service because tickets were sold out for tonight's event (Gareth Emery was playing).  Bottle service was about $2500+.  We had about 15 of us, so we all split the bill.  . . The place was half way packed.  There were a few people dancing on the floor, people walking around outside and inside, and people just chilling at their tables.  The bars inside and outside displayed the various liquors they had; the dance floor was a little small, but everyone made it a habit to dance on everything during the night; the sound systems sounded crisp, and you could hear every single laser beam and fart in the room; and the outside patio was vast and felt like a whole new world to explore and get lost (and possibly drown in the gigantic pool).. . And what's Marquee without seeing a few celebrities?  We saw freakin' Neil Patrick Harris making out with his sexy husband.  Oh man, Doogie Howser was eating his face like it was the last supper.  I also got to shake his hand.  Til' this day, I haven't watched my hand.  Now there's green bubbles and mushrooms growing on it.  Oh yeah, my friend went to the bathroom to relieve himself.  As he was urinating, he looked to his side and saw FLAVA FLAVVVVVV!!  YEAH, BOY!!!!  From what he said, Flava Flav was tilting all over the place and his bodyguards needed to help him stand up.  . . Marquee-- always guarantees a great time.  Seeing celebrities, dancing with hot chicks, shooting down liver-pounding drinks; it's like I died and went to hell.  Thanks, Marquee!!!!
WOAH..what happen marquee.... . NO hip hop room? Closed off!? . . I usually love Marquee, but my experience on MLK weekend wasn't good. I felt they were cutting off everything and I honestly felt cheated. . . Main dance floor = forget it. You won't be able to get in once the main DJ spins. . . Pretty disappointed this time.
This place gets jam-packed. Like you are in a can of sardines. Its a maze trying to get through. . . Coat check was a little difficult to find and was in a back corner on the other side of the club. If you don't have a table, good luck trying to get on the main dance floor and with 4 inch heels, you definitely don't want to be standing all night.. . The music is loud, and the atmosphere is lively. I loved it when the confetti started pouring down and large glow sticks being tossed out into the crowd. And these glow sticks are great for butt smacking ;) . . They also have a hip hop room where we did most of our dancing, but its even smaller and tighter than out on the main floor! You can guarantee a fun night here!
