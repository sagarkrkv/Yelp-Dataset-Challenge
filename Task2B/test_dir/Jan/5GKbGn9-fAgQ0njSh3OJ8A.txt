Nice Ambient, food very tasty but somehow we felt push by our server trying to pushes everything in the menu maybe he was trying to hard , price is little high for the value . I know they were extremely busy but we did wanted  to enjoy our meal everything was coming way to fast food not enough time to enjoy an expensive meal , plate were coming one behind the other super fast to fast
The food is yummy and the service is great!
Very nice restaurant. I found it odd that they were playing oldies rap & RnB in a supposed upscale place. I tried the Vodka sauce penne with chicken, and some sort of chicken pizza. The food was good, however the 'wow' factor was missing. Expected more out of this place.
Service terrible. We waited forever to get our food.  Would not recommend!  Coming from NY -  food was just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  Rice balls had to get sent back. Kobe ricotta meatball was good.. The spaghetti with the whole lobster de shelled  was definitely not a whole lobster.  The yellowfin tuna was good.. Definitely was not worth the money.  You had to ask for a glass of water. Drinks were watered down. If you have a few hours to kill and not interested in a good meal this is the place for you.
The cover photo of this is totally misleading! I almost missed it by a thread. . . Anyhoozies.. I haven't been here as a restaurant but as a pre-pahty bar/dance warm up, yes. Lavo has the luxury open bar from 10:30-Midnight on certain weekends. Whenever I plan a trip, open bar for the ladies at Lavo is always an option. . . Whenever I am in sin city the only drinks I can drink is red-bull vodka to keep my sleepy-self awake throughout the night. I know, I know.. energy drinks + sugar + alcohol is not great for your diet plus health. But it's sin city! Gluttony and debauchery is allowed. . . Music played here is always Top 40's + Mainstream Hip Hop unless stated otherwise. Mind you this is not a full nightclub. It is more of a big lounge with room to walk and breathe. There is bottle service for you fancies out there. Located in the Palazzo, on the entrance side. So you cannot missed it. Great place to pre-pahty, but don't get too trashed so you can jump to the next club. Staff are not peculiar, crowd ranges a lot since this is not usually the club folks would stay for the rest of the night. . . I wouldn't mind trying out the food here. The cover photo dish looks pretty delicious actually. :)
Thank you Francis and Johnny for making our anniversary/birthday dinner so much fun. Food was excellent, especially the sea bass and fried Oreos. Wonderful dinner experience.
I was in a bind and managed to get a reservation for 4 on a convention week on literally 10 minutes notice -- SCORE. . . Of course, it was at an old person time, but still. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so we got very lucky.. . The service here was friendly, but not too rehearsed, like it is in many of these nice hotel restaurants on the strip. Aperol negroni was awesome, unlike anything I'd had before. The menu is simple enough for people with different culinary incliations to find anything, and I was happy with the kobe meatball with spagetti.
Woo Hoo! I'm a fan of this place! What a great place to go if you want some good food and especially if you plan on clubbing at Tao after!! For a high end restaurant, portions are pretty big and the prices not so much. Most dishes run in the 20's but there are some that are about 40. We had 6 people in our dinner party can came here to celebrate my friends divorce. We came at 8 pm, our reservation was for 8:15 pm and we were immediately seated! Our bills was was about 260 or so and after tip it was about 315. We ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, a pizza and each of us had a drink. It was an average of about 50 each person and we were stuffed! Among the appetizers, we got the mushrooms, truffle fries and their famous meatball. For the entrees, we got fish (I forgot which one), carbonara, the kobe spaghetti, and a pizza. To me everything tasted good. I thoroughly enjoyed my carbonara... very rich, tasty, and total comfort food. The kobe meatball was tasty and melted in your mouth! I didn't try the pizza because my friend was lactose and got a pizza without the cheese... she said it wasn't too bad, not the worst but she wasn't wowed by it. . . I stayed at The Venetian, so I was able to charge the meal to my room and earn points. In my room, there was also a card for a free cocktail with entree. All of us girls had the pomegranate lemonade drink. The alcohol taste wasn't strong and it was pretty good. We all finished it. I don't remember our waiters name, but he was cute and gave us excellent service, everyone was really nice and efficient. The workers here work quick and hard! They carry stuff like it's nothing! We all couldn't believe it... by 9 pm, we had all our food AND had finished eating! Now that's fast! Sometimes at restaurants, it takes like 30 minutes for food to come out! And no, we were not eating fast either, no one even checked the time till we left! I like the decor. It's very dark inside though, with water elements all around. . . Upstairs, LAVO is no longer a nightclub. It is now an ultralounge. After you eat, go upstairs and check out the lounge. It's got a romantic dark vibe to it and very laid back since it's now a lounge (they still have the Saturday brunches which I believe is more club-vibe). Get your receipt from your meal and show it to the cocktail waitress upstairs in the lounge. Everyone in your party will get a FREE drink! We were able to get cocktails! So each of us got another cocktail at $14 each! That is a great deal!! So we each got to enjoy appetizers, entrees, and 2 cocktails for about $50 a person! ... but wait, the night isn't over yet!. . Before leaving LAVO, get your stamp from the door people for entry into Tao. We took our time walking to Tao as I think it was barely 11 pm after hanging out in the lounge for a bit and doing some gambling. A line was already in place for Tao going to the door... my friends kinda freaked about the line and I said not to worry because I'm a pro and practically live in Vegas! LOL. We walked right up to the bouncers, showed our stamp and walked right in!! NO line... and NO paying!! We grabbed more drinks at Tao and I showed them around the club. It was still pretty early for clubbing so the place wasn't packed. I was kind of bummed the roof was closed.... . For about $50, we got lots of food, drinks, and clubbing! Sounds like a cheap night out!!. . Both LAVO and Tao offer table packages too. Which, originally we were going to book, but the only dinner time for LAVO was 1030 pm and I told my friend I can't fill up on drinks and down tons of liquor that soon after because I will get sick. Anyways, the packages start at $82/person... for our group of 6 it would have been about $120 each person. This includes a 3 course meal at either LAVO or Tao AND a table with bottle service at Tao. I had called and asked for more information because I was going to seriously book this package and the alcohol included is top liquor alcohol... which included Gray Goose!! I did the math and if you get the most expensive item on each of the courses for LAVO, it's already $70! If you go this route, then you will have a table and sitting room... plus your own table bodyguard at the club. That what I want to do next time and feel like I'm a baller VIP! LOL. Dinner at Tao for this package however starts at 530 pm for Fri, Sat, Sun. Dinner at LAVO for this package starts at 530 pm on Fri and Sun, Sat starts at 1030 pm. I would choose to eat at LAVO because the food there is more pricey for the same package price and plus I'm Asian, so I don't like the high end Asian eateries because the best ones are the hole in the wall places. . . I will definitely be back here again, especially if I am planning on clubbing at Tao!
THIS PLACE IS POPPIN ON SAT for the Champagne brunch. . . Went there around 215-230 no cover for our group of guys.. . The ratio was literally 4 girls to 1 guy and more girls just kept coming in.. . Once 3:30pm starts the lights go down and it becomes a nightclub! Super fun and chill environment. . . Food was good at the bar and the drinks are strong. There is an outside patio too which was nice. . . Tiesto was there when I went and he was partying it up. You get Champagne goggle glasses to protect your eyes and it's just one crazy party! . . Definitely coming back during non-pool season
Place is amazing great food and great vibe!!also know know for the best day time party all winter lavo brunch! In in vegas you must check this place out!!
