I really cant decide if my stay at Hard Rock was great, good, or just okay. I had a great time overall, but it's clear to me now that we were just paying for the brand Hard Rock instead of any added luxury compared to other resorts. For what Hard Rock charges for a room, you'd think that the hotel would be maintained and have kept their appearance up. Other than the rooms, the Casino and resort were nice overall.. . Pluses: . -Our king room was a nice size and I loved the fact that we could open the french doors to the balcony. We were above the Hard Rock Guitar and could open the balcony and had total privacy. That was pretty awesome (except for the loud heat and air conditioning units on the roof below us).. -Our bed was SUPER comfy!! The mattress and bedding were luxurious and made me feel like I re-entered the womb. . -I enjoyed the decor. It was cool. It was nice not having the generic tropical bedding and ugly carpet like at other vegas hotels. It was comfortable and cool.. -The staff we encountered was nice. The bellperson and maids we spoke to were welcoming and cool. . -The Casino itself was awesome. Great vibe, great staff, great crowd, and unpretentious. I kind of felt cooler for staying there.. -We had a great brunch at Culinary Dropout.. . The Meh Factor:. -Too far from the strip. The shuttle they provide only runs every hour until 5 pm, so we never ended up taking it. The distance from the strip made it a destination for cool people and prevented everyone on the street from walking in like resorts on the strip. Can't decide if the distance was worth it, though. It would be PERFECT if it were closer to the strip. . -We reserved 2 king rooms that we wanted close to each other, but naturally they didnt have it and gave us 1 king and 1 with 2 queens, no biggie, it ended up working out fine. . . The not-so-great-parts:. -As you walk down the hall you notice the light fixtures are covered with cool Zyldjian cymbals... except every other one is missing. It's clear that once they get stolen they never get replaced. I cant decide if that was supposed to be hard rock, punk rock, or just plain ghetto.. -one of the lamps next to the bed was broken and if touched would just spin downwards. . -gum on the ceiling covering a blinking green light. Luckily the gum covered it for us, but you can totally tell that someone was pissed off enough to put gum on it. I wonder how long its been up there for.. -I didnt like the bathroom at all. Yes, there is a metal sink. How trendy and rock. But the shower curtain looked like it was borrowed from a hospital. White with blue dots- Im not kidding when I say it looked like a hospital gown.. . I was going to give my stay 3 stars, but after experiencing massive douche-baggery and unnecessary rudeness and pretentiousness at other resorts on this trip, im giving the Hard Rock 4 stars for being so cool.
Excellent hotel for only about 60 bucks in the summer time. I can only comment on the hotel since I didn't experience the casino in the hotel. . . The room we had had an excellent view of the strip and of the pool. My only complaint is that the pool is closed much too early. I drove as fast as I could just to get to the hotel and still missed the pool, but that is mu fault. I will definitely be back next summer!
I came for a long weekend and had a great stay. My partner and I had a king suite in the HRH Tower and it was just right - nice bed (too soft for us, but I think most people prefer that in their vacay mattress), nice sitting area with plenty of room for lounging, nice big bathroom with BIG soaking tub (and, yes, I did... it was lovely), plenty of space in closets and drawers, and a touchscreen-operated sound system with a bunch of songs preloaded, mostly big hit rock songs (my iphone wouldn't work with the system, sadly).. . I spent very little time or money in the actual casino, so I can't really speak to that part of the experience. I only had one meal at the casino, at the 24-hour diner. It was a good breakfast for Vegas-reasonable prices, and our server was on it (pink mohawk guy).. . The $22+tax/day resort fee includes wifi, valet, and some stuff I didn't use like the fitness center and, get this, notary service. We used the hotel as a jumping off point for exploring the area: the nearby White Rock Loop hike (highly recommended), the Neon Museum (I learned something!), Red Rocks Climbing Center (fine, but I'm spoiled here in Seattle), and Joshua Tree (O. M. to the G., YES.).. . This one is not on the Strip, for better and worse. Short walking distance spots like Hofbrauhaus, KISS mini golf (worth it!), StirKrazy Mongolian Grill, and CVS are some advantages for being a little "farther out," but there are some down-and-out folks to share the space with. There are a cluster of bars, some straight and some gay, about 10 minutes walk away. The ones we went into (Double Down and FreeZone) were just okay.. . The place isn't without it's cons, but the pros just far outweigh. When I start to get the itch to Vegas again in a couple years, I'll definitely look at returning to Hard Rock.
I'm writing this as we're sadly on our way back home. . This was only my second time in Vegas being over 21, so I don't have many rooms to compare it to, but I loved it here! . . Check in was at 3. We got to the front desk around 3:10 and waited 15 minutes in line. Check in was easy. I made my reservation on Priceline and didn't have a room type assigned. I called ahead to get a non smoking King room requested. At check in, they told me they didn't have any rooms with Kings ready so I can wait either 30 mins to an hour for that room or go straight into a room with two queens. My boyfriend and I were hungry, so waiting wasn't too bad. They said we'd get a call when our room was ready.... . We went to eat at Pink Taco (YUMMY) while we waited. We waited 30 mins... 45 mins... An hour... An hour and 15 mins later we just went to the front desk to ask if the room was ready and it was. We never got the call- oh well. . . The room was NICE. We were on the 11th floor in the Casino Tower. For the $45 I paid a night, I can't complain. (There's a $22 per night resort fee, but all hotels have something around that much so whatever) Like everyone else was saying, the bed is sooo comfy. The decor in the room is what you'd expect at the Hard Rock. All black and white with band pictures on the walls (We had Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles). TV was huge. Didn't watch it much, but it was decent when we used it. Everything on the mini bar is on a scale so if you touch something and don't use it, you pay for it. . Room has all the standards in in EXCEPT a coffee maker but that's no biggie. Go to Starbucks, you'll live. . . Bathroom was nice as well. I had read reviews that the sink and shower drain really slow. Mine were ok. Shower was a little slow but nothing to complain about, it's not like the water was up to my ankles or anything. Maybe I just got lucky with my room. . Another pro: late check out till noon is free. We were running late with showers and getting ready the day of check out, I called and asked for some shampoos while my boyfriend was showering. They came up with a BAG of items. Shower caps, a dental kit, mouthwash, toothpaste, body wash, extra body bars, facial bars, a beauty lot with q-tips, shaving cream. Every. Thing. It was a nice touch. . . One star was taken off for the distance from the strip (we had a car but it was still kinda far and we got lost and went down a one way road in the wrong direction one night- oops.) and for the front desk dropping the ball and making us wait too long for our room. . Other than that, I would definitely return! Had a great 2 nights!
Called early December for a Jan 11, 2014 weekend room.  Cost is $200 per room, asked for high floor king bed, and they can not accommodate.  Staff is rude! but husband wants to stay here.  the staff admits to being rude, allowing guest to party and interrupt all night, and no they will not allow a request for early check in.. Weekend has not even started and I'm dreading this stay ...
This hotel sucks... you've been warned. The staff doesn't seem to care about making you happy. All the furniture is old, chipped and damaged. The carpet feels like a thin cheap piece of crap. It felt like i was in a damn homeless shelter.... . When we checked in thier system was down so they couldnt check us in. There was a guy there who got locked out of his room and had been waiting there for 3 hrs (it was about 2am at the time) He couldnt even go anywhere because his ID was ib the room.. . They had someone take us to a room where we could stay. There was a stain on the sheet and some of the candy missing on the snack bar. The worst part was that there was an annoying sound coming from the corner of the room, maybe from the AC. OMG it was soo annoying!!! We couldnt sleep all night so the next morning we looked like walking zombies on crack.. . The even worser part was that since thier system was down they couldnt even give us room keys! So someone had to stay in the room all day to be able to get back in. Their elevators also require a room key. We can even all go out to eat! Basically we were being held hostage in a homeless shelter.
Upon first glance the room was pretty nice but after looking a bIt deeper some areas of the room we're caked with dust and grime. The bathroom only had half a roll of t.p. There's no coffee pot in the room because they want you to spend $7 on two coffee's downstairs. Some of the staf we're very rude and not helpful. Not only did there entire computer system go down leaving you unable to use credit cards in shops but they lost our baggage. The best part was when they over charged my card by adding everything in the mini bar to my tab. I used nothing.Be careful of the wind and don't knock anything over o you will be charged. The hallways we're full of trash too. lovely! I am sorry but just because you want to stay at a cool rock and roll hotel with atmosphere does not mean you want to live in filth or be treated poorly. I would avoid this place!
Stayed here for one night because my boyfriend and I were going to a concert at the Joint and didn't want to deal with the traffic and having to drive home (we live in Henderson, just outside of Vegas). We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. . . Check-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. . . There are signs all over the casino and hotel that says "no outside food or beverage allowed" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. . . The rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. . . Also, the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to stay here. It is not on the strip and it's a further walk from it than you would expect. If you stay here but want to go to other casinos, you better take a cab or have a car. . . The only positives about this hotel is the decor and the Joint. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from Hard Rock - modern with a punk influence and the Joint was awesome! A great intimate venue (but the drinks are extremely overpriced - $7 for a very small cheap beer like shocktop - you could buy a whole 6-pack at the CVS across the street for that much!). . Basically, just don't stay here unless you're looking to party hard in your hotel and piss everyone on your floor off. The staff doesn't do anything about parties and loud music in the suites. I've had a few friends get suites just to throw parties and you can hear the music all the way down the hall, but staff never said a word to them. They obviously don't care about the customers in suites that are actually trying to get some rest at 3 in the morning.
DO NOT STAY HERE....if you do you deserve what you get.  Wanted to make a special night for our daughter's 16th birthday before the party the next day.  Booked a package deal to watch concert.  VERY long wait to check in, valet is a joke, called and emailed concierge to book limo and to try and organize a few other things for her, took over two weeks to email back and never responded.  Never did get any help so not sure why they have concierge, ordered room service because they didn't get back to us about reservations, so ordered steak dinner and was TERRIBLE.  Customer service appears to be a 4 letter word for them, bill was incorrect at check out , thought they got it fixed only to mess it up again a few days later.  Had to call in again and got nothing but attitude.  Went to Bellagio a few months prior for a girls weekend and saw show, organized all kinds of special treatments through their concierge who knows what that means.  There are too many choices in Vegas for Hard Rock to offer such poor service.  They are also way off the strip......NEVER EVER AGAIN will we stay here and we will be sure that none of our friends or family will either.  I am more than happy to spend our money somewhere else that knows how to treat people.
My wife and I stayed here for a short getaway trip.  We booked on Priceline and got a great deal.  The lobby was nice and upon check-in, we asked for a quiet room.  They actually upgraded our room which gave us a better view.  . . The room was very dark with the only lighting coming from dim lamps.  No refrigerator, no microwave.  They even have signs in the elevator lobby stating no outside food and drink.  The minibar was very well stocked and expensive.  . . The bathroom was very dark and to make it worse, the tile was black, so it seemed much darker.  Also, with the dark tile, it was hard to see the wet floor.  The shower was large enough for a couple of people. . . Maybe I'm not cool enough or young enough (I'm 35), but this place is for the younger hipper crowd, which is what I expected.   . . Didn't have to pay for parking or wifi, but I assume those were part of the "resort fees."    The resort fees were lower than some of the other hotels.. . Good collection of memorabilia.  And they do play loud music.  . . The casino/gambling floor seemed small and almost seemed like an after-thought.. . The hotel has some clothing stores, a place to get a tattoo, a salon, and several places to eat.  Not cheap, but the one place we ate was decent.  . . I'd go back, for the right price.
We stayed here on a Saturday night in December. My Mothers Christmas Party was being held here. We arrived to check in around 4pm with a very long line to check in. Once we got to the counter they seemed very confused but we did finally get into our room. The elevator to get to your room is a pain because you have to slide your key it requires the elevator ride to be a experience. I encountered many people who were drunk later that night that had a terrible time going up and down trying to get to their floor. Once we arrived to the room  the size was nice enough but the smell was HORRIBLE. I dont know if it was people in the rooms next to us or rotten water but it just wasn't a pleasant place to stay in. I was really wishing I had air freshener. The decor in the rooms is really nice but I am not sure what was going on with the smell of the place. I would stay there again but only if we got another deal because I had a hard time finding good places to get a quick bite to eat and like I said earlier the elevators are a PAIN.
Check in was quick & easy! Everything has been perfect thus far. Rooms are #rocknroll & clean. Beds are comfy . Food is good. Time to party! Haha! #vegasbaby
We've stayed here a couple times, HRH tower. Can't beat the price. It's always fun to wake up to rock stars. We were bummed to find out Chemo is no longer at the Circle Bar, he was our favorite bar tender.
Ya, it's the Hard Rock. Listen this is where AVN is and it is nice to catch up with friends every year. Yes the rock stars hang out here and the wanna be rock stars are here as well. If you like to people watch, you will probably spot a few "stars" if you are into that sort of thing.... Mr. Lucky's is pretty decent for food, nachos are tasty for sure..
This was my first time in the hard rock, and what a coincidence! Avns are going on. There is all kinds of people watching, from barely dressed girls and well known porn stars to hunky guys with tattoos. It was great! The cab line was long but I didnt care...I had cute guys behind me:-)
they had a porn convention for 4 days, it was crazy with all the pervs and everybody was taking pictures with them like they were movie stars :)
Ok short and to the point here for me. I dont think that this Casino is nearly half as good as most of the casino's on the strip or even in downtown... but it is what it is, a passe idea of restaurants turned casino when most of the restaurants are bleh at best... I think this place is just another way to have money sucked out of your pocket.... . Seriously when was the last time you went to a Hard Rock to buy a t-shirt to show you were in some far flung destination. Wasntthat so 20-25 years ago? I remember I was stoked to have a Hard Rock Bangkok t shirt 20 years ago! So yeah it seems likes its a totally dated idea. Some folks perhaps still ascribe to that setup, however, I dont know anyone who still does.. . Overall this place had average at best customer service and friendliness. I wasnt impressed by the folks at the table games or who were on the floor. I asked 3 different people where the hard rock cafe was, and the first two didnt know or have a clue. I happened to be with three young ladies who wanted to eat there as their was a yelp check in deal. However unbeknownst to all of us, it was in a separate building. Sadly it took a while (3rd staff member) to tell us where the place was.. . On top of that the table staff wasnt nearly half as friendly or outgoing as I normally find. This was at roulette and craps. Too bad since those are two of my favorite games and I wanted to gamble a bit. But when there is a lousy mood coming from the staff... who wants to spend money to be around that kinda crap.. . It was clean. They had all the standard games and lots o slots. They have a giant hotel as well. But honestly, I couldnt care less and wont be back unless there is something special happening here that I HAVE to attend. My honest to goodness reaction is that it isnt worth 3 stars but i couldnt find anything specific to lower the grade on it for. It is just meh to the nth degree.
You get what you pay for. We were heading on a trip to a couple national parks and needed to spend a night in Vegas as a pitstop in between and without thinking I looked for a cheap room to stay at for a night because we would get there late at night and leave early in the morning. I mean $40 (plus their 20 something dollar fee) it was gonna be just one night anyway. . . I really really wish I just booked a room at planet Hollywood and paid the higher difference. The room smelled like cigarettes, I mean wreaked as if someone had just smoked in there right before we came in. It did not look clean. I'm not a germaphobe but I was really getting paranoid about touching anything because it seemed like nothing's been cleaned (especially in the shower). . . The only good thing about our room were the beds. Makes you feel like you're sleeping on clouds but not the type where you feel like you sink in and touch the floor. The bed hugs you to sleep. . . My mom had a difficult time falling asleep because there's like four big vents/fans outside that are always running that make noise all night. . . Self parking isn't difficult to find. And the express check out through the tv was simple. . . I would say only come here if you're super desperate. Otherwise I think you're better off booking a room on the strip.
I stayed at the Hard Rock with a few friends for New Years.  Location wise, it was a little further from the strip than expected (we priceline'd so I guess that's the risk you take when bidding) so cabbing it everywhere can get pretty expensive.  The check in wasn't so bad but the checkout took a good 20 minutes & for them to send someone up to help with luggage.  We also requested fresh towels the second day but never got them.  The hotel is a little outdated, not as nice as the website leads you to believe but I guess all hotels do that.  The hotels on site are ok & the clubs are ghetto.  The staff overall were about a 7.5 on a scale from 1 to 10.
The positives heavily outweigh the negatives.  In fact, there is only one negative -- the casino is very small, but ample enough to do damage.. . But I have a hard (as a rock, get it?) time coming up with anything wrong, when so much is right.  Let me list the ways:. . 1.  First and last impression, valet, is terrific and quick.. 2.  Check-in desk could be shorter, but they are as nice as pie, and helpful as nurses.. 3.  Rooms are super nice, modern, and sexy.. 4.  Price of room, midweek on Travelocity, was $32 (with a $22 resort fee).. 5.  Room was quiet.. 6.  Wi-Fi signal was strong, and access was easy.  The resort fee includes access.. 7.  Wonderful restaurants and bars.  From Culinary Dropout, Pink Taco, and Mr. Lucky's (a 24 hour diner), and others.. 8.  The Joint, is a deluxe music venue.  Great.. 9.  Vinyl, is a more intimate venue.  Also great.. 10.  The pool is as sexy as it gets.. . While there is bound to be more I can expand upon, it's way worth it.
I stayed here two years ago for my birthday. We stayed 2 nights here at the HRH All Tower King Suite, and then 2 nights at the Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers 1 bedroom suite.  The rooms are just ok to me. Visually, it looks exactly how it appears on their website, but things were just off.  The lamp they have that hangs on the wall above their couch was bent. Almost looked like someone tried to swing on it the night before lol. Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas right? But could you fix it before we check in? Oh, let me explain one thing, there were 4 in my group, 2 of us each stayed in the HRH King Suites, and we had adjoining rooms, so in one room, the internal ipod dock and speakers they had within the room worked perfectly, in the other one it didnt work at all. That was a let down, because that's one of the coolest features of this room. Since we were only staying for 2 nights and were able to share the sound system we didn't ask to switch rooms or complain about it at all.  Last downside would be in my cousins room their toilet was pre clogged. Plus sides? They came up right away when we called them with this issue and fixed it immediately. Bed was comfortable and couch was comfortable. It's off the strip so if you don't mind walking or taking taxis its not too bad. We always rent a car so we are never too worried if we want to stay somewhere off the strip.
Free rooms...How can you get better than that. The girl that comes around and massages while you play is a delight!! Love the Hard Rock!
