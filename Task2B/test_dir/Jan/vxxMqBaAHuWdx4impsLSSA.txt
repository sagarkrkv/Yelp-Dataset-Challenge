Brunch and Holiday Buffet is a bit pricey ($39.99 per person), but we went there prior to 11am and got in for the breakfast price of $10.99. The food isn't worth $40 per person so get there around 10am (lines are long) pay the cheaper price and you get the best of both worlds.. . The best part of the buffet is the crab legs, Asian food selection, and deserts. The crab legs are cut in half and make it very easy to eat, this alone is worth the trip. They also have sushi, curry dishes, and other Asian foods. Deserts are yummy and they also make fresh cappuccinos, lattes, and other flavored coffees. . . Service is very fast and the wait staff is very attentive and polite. We sat next to the window overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, very nice. Remember to take care of them.. . Yes, they have complimentary beer (Coors, Hefeweizen, and IPA) and champagne. I'm not sure what beers or champagne brands they were so YMMV. Don't make you're decision to eat here based on the alcohol alone, there's too much to enjoy here. . . I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
I would recommend this buffet to anyone. This is one of the buffets that includes beverages, even alcoholic drinks as well. They have a wide array of selections of hot food, seafood, salads and soups.  They also have a huge selection of desserts and ice cream. The wait is a bit long, watch out for the promotional offers/price/deals of the day since it is not clearly stated. Check the register first to see the prices of the day.
Great buffet off the strip but good food and desserts plus beer and wine are included with cost.
I "think" I'm at the right place?. I'm staying here at the M Resort. I came for the breakfast buffet. It was the same as any HUGE HOTEL BUFFER BREAKFAST-dry, over cooked foods sitting in trays, a big sticky mess with 20% of the items empty (not refilled).. One super friendly(unusual) very slow custom eggs to order guy. Big line 4 eggs, is it worth the wait? If you saw their waaaaaaaay over cooked "eggs Benedict" the yolks were hard as rocks (and that was their FRESH BATCH right from the kitchen. The fruits were either empty plates or under/over ripe. . Oh yeh, we had a old surly waitress? Why? Doesn't she work for tips? She was rude, abrupt & slow...and that was just for liquids??? What's up? . ----Overall review:1.5 stars. ----Just another sub par mediocre breakfast buffet.. -----(NOTE:This review is ONLY 4 the BREAKFAST BUFFET)
I'd been disappointed with the buffet at the M after going my birthday weekend in August 2012, but I came back recently just a few days before Christmas 2013.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it still is!  First off, we came on an off night so it was pretty empty.  That meant easier access to food.  However, this didn't mean we missed out on awesome seafood.  I got my fill of oysters for sure.. . Everything was good quality the night I came as well and didn't taste off like it has in times before.  The desserts here are always really good too.  This place is a little trip off the strip but pretty worth it.  Definitely one of my top Vegas buffets to visit for sure.
So dissappointing.   Moved to LV a little over a year ago.  Asked around for best buffet, and was told repeatedly that it was the M.  Went there for Seafood Brunch - Fantastic!  Have gone back several times with out of town visitors.   But, something has changed.  Now, not only would I not go again (after two bad outings), I won't be taking anyone there.   . . Sunday, went for the breakfast buffet- $10.  Awful.  Most pans were either empty, or in need of a refill.  I finally got a serving of Eggs Benedict (my favorite) - muffin wasn't even cooked, let alone warm.  Egg: over done.  Didn't finish it).   Line for "cooked to order eggs" was ridiculously out of hand - they had the line following the buffet, making easily 1/3 of it next to impossible to access (Management, Really?  Don't you see how this is ineffective?  I would have had that line re-routed within 5 minutes, and I don't even work in F&B industry).  . . Today, I played at the M so I earned a 'free' lunch buffet.  Line wasn't long, so I went on in.  After I paid, I still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  Once I was allowed entry, I was escorted to  my table, passing by many empty tables and many tables that needed to be cleared.  Food was just 'meh'.  . . True that the desserts are plentiful and tasty - but the same every time I've been there.  No variety.  Not worth it.. . Sorry Studio B - whatever changes have happened, you've lost 2 customers in my husband & me.
Over the holidays, all the buffets on the strip were charging up the a$$ for their "holiday buffets." In addition to the super expensive meals, the lines were all insanely long. As much asI love Bacchanal, there was no way i was going to spend 3+ hrs of my vacation time waiting in line to eat.. . My family and I stopped by Studio B at the M hotel at the recommendation of some of our friends who live in the area. HOLY CRAP. THE FOOD WAS GREAT.  I'm so glad that we did. For just $40 per person we were able to enjoy their amazing seafood buffet. They offer so many types of seafood: crab legs, oysters, shrimp, etc. I really loved their prime rib. It was seriously some of the best I've had in Vegas. It  is perfectly roasted to a medium rare and super tender. I think I had 3 slabs of the stuff!. . Booze is also included at Studio B. It's not the best beer and wine, but it is free :) . . The best part: I only waited about 15 min before I was seated :) . . It's unfortunate that the M Hotel is so far from the strip, but it does make Studio B the perfect stop for Californians coming in and out of Las Vegas!
Love this buffet, they even had mimosa and champagne! Overall the food was ok for brunch. We came here versus going to Bacchanal because it was on our way back to Cali and the line wasn't super duper long. Love it, service was pretty good, but it took awhile for us to get seated and get our drinks ordered, otherwise, the extensive array of food made it almost impossible to try everything. For the most part the food was good, I really enjoyed the beef roast, the pad thai, their sesame chicken. The dessert section was delicious, they had creme brulee, an assortment of mousses, and tiramisu, which I enjoyed the most. The creme brulee was also super yummy. And my friend, who is a fan of flan, said it was probably one of the best flan's she's tasted. Again, I'm not a fan of flan, but anyone who is, may want to definitely come try it. Gelatto was also delicious, but less creamy than the ones I've tasted, I liked the pistachio flavor the most only because they had small bits of real pistachio in it.. . They even had a bar where you can order champagne and wine. I got the mimosa, and it was a bit strong for me, luckily I just diluted i with more orange juice. To order drinks, just bring your ID over. Great thing about this place is that you can go to the restroom and come back, the workers don't say anything to people coming and going.. . For me I would rather go at night then in the day. We pay $40 per person for the brunch menu, but I feel like there could have been more of an assortment of seafood. The only thing I really enjoyed seafood wise were the mussels with the mayonnaise. Everything else was mediocre for me.
Ok, some people think $39 is expensive for this buffet but they forget to tell you that the price includes all you can drink beer and wine.  I am not a drinker so I did not have any booze but let me tell you that I was still thrilled with the place. . . I try to stay away from the strip due to all the rude workers at the strip.  Some people are nice but there is so much cattle traveling through those places on the strip that some people naturally feel that they can lie and be rude to you.  That was my experience at Pampas on the strip.  After that experience I was a bit gun shy about another buffet.  My father took me to Studio B at M resort.. . Lets put it this way, my father is a local and likes to go to the local places in Vegas because the crowds are smaller and the people are nicer.  I am not a local but after dining at Studio B I asked if there were any homes for sale within walking distance to this restaurant.  . . My favorite buffet has always been Fugo De Chao but there is a new kid on the block!. This place is unbelievable.  Good thing I brought some digestive enzyme pills with me because the food was so great that I polished off 4 plates, 2 coffee drinks and many desserts.  I am not a big dessert guy but the quality of their food was so incredible I just had to keep going back for more. . . This place is awesome.  It feels like you are entering an airport when you go back for food.  The place is so huge and they have so many selections it is nothing short of amazing.   One of the other reviewers said that they also have a breakfast buffet.  I will definitely want to try that next time, especially if it is only $10.99 as he said. . . The only problem I can see that would have ruined the experience is that others have found out about this place and the lines can be long to get in.  Try to get there ahead of the crowd.  Do NOT rush yourself.  Take it all in and spend hours there enjoying it.  The food is worth the $39 which by the way also includes the tip so in reality it is only about $34 unless you are deadbeat that never tips.
Having dinner at Studio B buffet.  For $40 a person, I am very disappointed.  There's a tiny section for sushi (one plate and some rolls) and there are only 2-3 kinds.  The Osso Bucco is as hard as leather.  Pad Thai too spicy.  Crab legs are very thin and hardly have any meat.  Oysters and shrimp are ok.  One Plus is that beer and wine are included.  I just don't think the price is worth it.  Will definitely not be back.
As far as Las Vegas buffets go, Studio B is at the top of my list.  Prices are cheap (around $10/person for breakfast, under $20 for lunch), and the food is great.Plenty of options - my favorite is the half pear with goat cheese.  Lunch and dinner include sushi, indian, chinese, thai, mexican and many american options.  The beverage bar is an awesome include - how cool is the all you can drink beer/wine/cider at lunch and dinner?!?  Most of the beers are local microbrews, and they even have a microbrew root beer as well.  Save room for dessert - one of the best dessert bars I've ever experienced.  Besides the 20 flavors of ice cream, my favorites include the lava cake, tiramisu and the cheesecake.  There are sugarless desserts too, but who's counting calories at this point.  Definitely check it out - I've been multiple times at all times of the day.  Top secret Yelp tip - if you show up 5 minutes before lunch, you still pay the breakfast price, but the lunch food will be set out before you even get to your table!
Hands down best buffet in Vegas. This place has a fantastic selection, food is constantly being refilled. So many great selections.. . I've been coming here since they opened and I can tell you they haven't skimped on the quality. . . Some of my faves:. 1. Crab legs: they've got two stations, hot and cold. Served with melted butter (not for me). These used to come with shell crackers until they started shaving them open. I used to think this new procedure distracted from the fun, but now it just gets more crab legs in my belly in less time.. 2. Prime Rib: so juicy and so tender. Get the rare cut and add some horseradish to that thug. You won't be disappointed.. 3. Beer and wine: the selection has increased since I first visited. Always included and always unlimited.. 4. Sushi/sashimi: while it is buffet quality, it's still delish. Hint: ask for a bowl of sashimi to skip on the carbs!. 5. Desserts: self explanatory. 6. Espresso and coffee bar: ask for a shot of kahluha or Baileys with your coffee and dessert!. . . Now that you know: do yourself a damn favor and drive away from the strip craziness, loosen your belt, and post up for a couple of hours.
I saw some reviews regarding this place so I decided to check it out. This place offers no no crab legs. Yes no crab legs on weekdays and you still pay $25 for the Buffett. This is the worst Las Vegas Buffett I ever had. They earn a star for no lines. You come in and you eat ASAP. They earn another star for their desert especially the cookies that were delicious. If you like seafood then they away from this place. They mix their clams with barnacles shells in the same tray which provided a weird taste. They have miniature crayfish for you to eat. Yup tiny tiny. I will never go here again. People go here because they comp free meals if you gamble. Don't ever pay for  this Buffett at m hotel
buffet no as good. since penn gaming. took over the place dishes were cold   quality not as good.
If you want bottomless beer and wine then THIS IS the place for you. No other buffet has that kind of service. But if you have already experienced Bachannal Buffet.. I promise you that you will kick yourself on coming here.. . Either we came here on a bad day, or the food was just seriously disappointing! We have tempted on trying this place for some time because it was named "best buffet" in Vegas. But the M Resort is seriously inconveniently far off the strip. . . The buffet we tried was the seafood brunch, which the price ($40) was higher than usual. It was a slower day, so there weren't a whole lot of options. We basically drank to get our money's worth. There was the standard crab legs, shrimp, and oysters. The oxtail, bisque soup, and some desserts looked great, but lacked a bit on flavor and texture.
This is always a go to when I'm in Las Vegas.  If you want lunch/dinner get here before 2:30pm so you pay lunch prices but get dinner food items!!!
