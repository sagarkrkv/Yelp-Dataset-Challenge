Absolutely love Egg and I been coming here as long as I can remember!!! The staff is amazing as well as the quality of food and the menu is quite selective!!! Their motto is eggsactly  what you want and they mean that!!! We eat here at least four or five times a week and it is always a homerun!!! Best breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas as well as a very well ran business!!! Brad is one half of a business owner and as you can see there is never turnover in any of his four locations soon-to-be five!!! In this town you are as good as your last meal!!!
I have been there several times and every time I have a great experience. We have ordered different things bisquit and gravy, omelets, pancakes, all the regular breakfast foods and everything have tasted great. You cannot leave this place without trying the banana nut muffin, breakfast potatoes and the coffee. All the dishes we have tried for breakfast have been delicious. This place is a must and is on our list for every Vegas trip. We have even purchased their coffee bag to make their coffee back at home.
Good Breakfast spot in Las Vegas!  We enjoyed it over the Thanksgiving Holiday.
This place is PACKED and for good reason - everything on the menu is delish! Crisp bacon, Rueben sandwiches on homemade rye bread, banana nut bread muffins dripping with butter, and oh by the way - the staff is exceptional! I would take a cab from The Strip for breakfast again at this place!
Who knew that making over easy eggs was an artform?  This place has mastered the art of making eggs.  I was visiting Vegas with family and actually craving pancakes, but I couldn't eat at a place called "The Egg & I" and not have eggs.  So I ordered a simple breakfast the Eggs Plus (over easy eggs, grits, toast, and bacon).  I had never seen such a perfectly cooked over easy egg, and it definitely tasted that way.  The white of the egg was so airy!  My mom was willing to share a bite of her eggs benedit, and they were soooo good!  I felt I had to commemorate the visit, so I boughtmy mom an "Egg & I" coffee mug.  :)  Oh, and the staff was very friendly.
DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE. We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
Found another bomb breakfast place in Vegas!! this place is on the Zagat list so that's why it gets a lot of ppl there every morning!! we ordered the steak benedict n the corned beef. Let me tell u this... the steak benedict was sooo good lots of steak in it so I was really full after! but the corned beef was even better!! My gf ordered that one wanna swtich with her hahah kinda far from the strip but its worth the drive tho!!
Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 6/100. . Be sure to arrive early (before 9am) if you want to be seated within 10 minutes because those banana nut muffins are pretty amazing!. . Servers are always busy and it can be hard to get their attention with a never-ending inflow of people so what you can do is turn your eye to your table stand. Flip from a black to a yellow egg as an indicator that you're ready and a server would be at your table in no time. I found it unique and utterly adorable. . . After taking a while to eye the vast newspaper style menu, I got a huge portion of tender country fried chicken served with over easy eggs, home fries and their iconic banana nut muffin while mommy got the chicken, broccolli and mushroom skillet. It was the best thing that happened that morning. . . A point to take note of; the skillet is blanketed with a layer of cheddar cheese (wink to the lactose intolerant). To my fellow mint-lovers, do not miss the caramel peppermint candies available at the cashier. Slip a couple more of em' in your pockets if you can.
From the outside (& inside) it looks like a typical diner type restaurant BUT dine here you'll soon notice the difference. . . First, the staff is great, always warm & welcoming. Second, they have a system in place so you never have to wait longer than a couple seconds for anything (whether it's more water, ketchup, your order).. . The food is really good!! I've never tried anything I didn't like here and they're consistently good! Their coffee is my absolute favorite coffee, it's rich and full of flavor. . . My favorite items:. . - Their skillets are really good, esp. The bacon & onion one.. . - Avocado bacon & cheese omlette. . - Banana bread french toast. . - Pancakes. . It's a great place for a fuss free brunch, sweatpants and hangover included.
This is a great breakfast spot in Vegas if you are visiting the strip and have a car. If you want to avoid long lines or expensive buffets, this is a great local alternative. Be prepared to wait in line! There is usually some time of wait in the morning to brunch. I would definitely recommend trying to get there as early as possible. When I first walked in, I thought...hmm this looks like a glorified Denny's. However, the painting on the wall was cute but the the rest of the restaurant was a bit dated in decor. However, it was easy to ignore all of that and realize that every seat was packed with a combination of locals and visitors to the great city of Las Vegas. . . Being a more health conscious eater, I ordered a egg white veggie omelette. My husband ordered the combination of eggs over easy and banana nut pancakes. Both were excellent, high quality ingredients and well made. The best part was getting the bill which was just a little over $20. That amount would barely cover one person's entrance into a mediocre Vegas strip brunch buffet.
Love this place--it's like Cheers, everybody knows my name!. Been eating here since I was in Elementary school....did you know this place opened up in 1983? Just a little food for thought! :). . Anyway, about the food...I love and highly suggest the:. -Italian skillet. -Corn beef hash. And my new favorite.... -Pork Carnitas!!!!!! (Drool). . Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, it's an oldie but a goodie! :)
We came after a fun weekened at the strip. My friend flew in to meet us for a friends bachlorette. And she had to catch a flight back. So we wanted something good but quick. I looked on yelp for a breakfast joint and found this. We walked in and asked if we could sit and eat within an hour. And the host said we could if we sat outside (since everyone wanted to sit inside because it was a bit chillythat day) so we sat outside... ordered quickly... i had the flapper ( eggs bacon and pancakes. ) My friend had the burger . And the other two had biscuits with gravy. Everything came out very fast. We couldnt belive it.also... Crystal was the best server!! She was constantly checking on us and made sure we had everything we needed. So back to the food. OMG. My food was good. But my friends burger with fries was amazing!!! And the biscuits with gravy! But that burger.... lol. Maybe I was a little hungover.. but it was so juicy.the bread was not your typical diner bun. Also the french fries were the match stick kind with great seasoning.. only thing I would recommend is that they mix plain fries with these seasoned match stick fries ... I found myself fighting to eat all of them because It was a bit salty. Other than that I will definitely come back when I go on my weekend getaways to vegas! :)
This place has a real vibe to it. At first, the goofy murals on the walls seemed a bit overly cheery for me but after perusing the huge menu and talking a bit with our friendly waitress, a delightful pregnant English lass, i really started to get the theme. This place is all about freshness, growth, and fertility. Our waitress mentioned it and i remembered reading a review saying they always seem to have pregnant women working there. I think that's beautiful! Celebrate life, ladies!
Friendly staff, regular customers addressed by first name, oh and great, fresh food.. Banana nut muffins were great, waffles with heaps of blueberries, potatoes tossed in spicy cajun seasoning, andthe chicken guac omelet (decided to go light) definitely hit the spot. Worth it if you don't want the crowd and headache of casino buffets.. Why would you, if you can have this! Will be back.
Our Friday morning Breakfast Club seems to be expanding and we ventured out to The Egg and I with a few new members. Looking back, we should have chosen a different location to welcome new members. I was not impressed with the waitress, who seemed to cop an attitude when reminded she shorted us a water. Of course I got the Chicken Fried Steak, but was met with resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. This turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. The CFS itself was good, as were the potatoes. The eggs were eggs. I was leaning towards two stars, but the quality of the food helped to compensate for the difficult waitress.
