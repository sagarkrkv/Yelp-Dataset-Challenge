who ever worked security last night was rude and should be written up ( all six  if them). my family member was kicked out a 3 am for complaining about maid who came into room unannounced . no one was drunk. someone needed diabetes medicine and all room keys were deactivated . needless to say all moments were very frustrating. that's what you get when you tip a hundred dollars off the bat . don't stay here
We stayed at Luxor for NYE 2013/2014. We paid around 700 USD for two nights, plus a resort fee of around 50 USD.. . We were very disappointed by Luxor! I did not see the resort fee mentioned anywhere when I booked it, so the 50 extra USD came out of nowhere. The room (Tower Deluxe King) was ok but nothing special, everything is very tacky and has a late 80'es plastic feel. There's no wifi available (you cannot even purchase it..), only wired - many modern computers haven't had a network plug for many years now, making wired internet access irrelevant - and what about smartphones and iPads? Good luck getting online at Luxor.. . Our bedding had holes in it for one of the pillows, and the soap in the bathroom had black hairs under it when we picked it up.. . I have stayed in much better hotels at a much lower price.. . All in all not somewhere I would recommend anywhere to stay at. I give them one star only because the people there were nice, and because valet parking was very fast.. And because I'm unable to give less than 1 star.
I stayed here with some friends from 12/14-12/16. We were upgraded to the tower which is supposed to be nicer and newer?. . The room was okay. If you're expecting a view of the strip from the tower, don't. Our view was of the parking garage. . . For the price we paid, I wasn't expecting 5 star amenities. However, only 3 stars because: no wifi!!!!, no iphone/iPod Dock (only outdated radio clock), and for whatever reason I kept sneezing my brains out! It must have been really dusty in that room because my allergies were acting up.
Worst hotel experience EVER! We were trying to be thrifty and booked a room here through Expedia and, boy, did we get what we paid for. First off, check in time was 1 pm, however, we checked in at 4 pm. When we got to our room, it hadn't been cleaned yet. On top of that, the ceiling was leaking from the rain outside (their fix was to put a champagne bucket under the leak). After my sister called to complain, they upgraded us to another room in the tower. If you decide to stay at this hotel, make sure you book a room in the tower and not the pyramid. On another note, be prepared to deal with annoying staff members lurking by every elevator and staircase trying to sell you tickets for events at the hotel...they are super pushy and annoying.
when i was a young kid and my folks would bring us to vegas, i always wanted to stay at the Luxor. The pyramid shape, dark shine, and mysterious vibe fascinated me..  . Years later, we ended up booking it for this 2014 NYE . we booked two rooms with two queen beds on the 19th floor through orbitz. it charged us 1250 but failed to mention that there is an extra $60 hotel fee per room. So there goes another $120 bucks. We get there early like 11am and lady says check-in is at 4pm even though there were rooms available. We said we just wanted to check into one room because we had a fussy child with us and they said there would be extra charge. So there goes 22 bucks.  Also, the Luxor site never listed amenities on site. we get there to find no little fridge to store some of the food we bought for the child. and that they would charge us $25 a day (for three days) for fridge rent. there goes another 75 bucks. . I drank a lot during that weekend and getting access to some water was a bitch. I woke up late one night and my water bottles were empty. i walked around on the floor and they had no vending machines. I asked room service and she said anything from glass of water to a full meal will take an hour because its New yrs weekend. And this hotel is so spread out that I had a full workout trying to get some water and ended up buying a bunch at local grocery stores blocks away so that I can store it in my warm, fridge-less room! ugh. AND NO WIFI. What century are we in. some man on out floor was pretty much sitting out in the lobby or hallway the entire afternoon trying to get some work related things done with little internet connection. we bought our ipads and laptops but couldnt use anything unless we went down to casino ground floor. . The elevators are scary and haunted!!! yes, they take you to whatever floor they want you to go haha. . The buffet sucked. but they had other good food spots and starbucks. . Only thing I liked was the little pyramid soap in the bathroom lol and the body exhibit show (they had cool show deals and discounts/coupons on food and show purchases when you check in). . I feel like I paid too much for this hotel. Only reason ill be back is because my parents gamble so much that they might send us free/cheap room offers.
I travel a lot to Vegas & the times I've gone , I stayed  here . The hotel itself is okay . Every time I stay here I have no wifi on my phone which annoys the crap out of me . Last time I stayed there was no hot water in the shower !!!!! The time sharing people get really annoying & if you say that you're not staying  here another night , they keep insisting if you're coming again blah blah blah they get really annoying . . . The buffet food is not so good  so don't waste your money there , the food had no taste whatsoever and there's very few choices of food . . . Overall this hotel is not the luxurious but if you're only staying a night I recommend it .
I saw them 2 years ago. There show was spectacular. Really enjoyed. Back again with friend and familia.
What a beautiful hotel!  I loved the Egyptian theme! Our room was accessible by "inclinator"...very awesome experience! The room was nice and reasonably priced.  Views were beautiful. The pool was LARGE and didn't offer much shade! I was burned pretty good - my advice, sunscreen! I also loved the accessibility to the beautiful, more upscale, Mandalay Bay-both by walking AND a monorail!
The only problem I see is that this place is really old and needs to be updated. Welp, most of the hotels in Vegas are old, really.  But anywho, I cannot review the hotel itself because I didn't stay here but I did watch the Jabbawockeez (again) at their theatre.  The theatre was big enough but not too big. The Jabbawockeez did a fantastic job once again.
The Hotel was pretty nice. It's on the southern end of the Las Vegas strip. If you stay there make sure you book a tower room. The tower rooms are bigger than the pyramid rooms. My main problem with my stay happened on day 2. We left our room at about 11 am. We came back  at about 5 to see that housekeeping cleaned our bathroom but not the main room. I didn't get mad but that was a deal breaker for me. I doubt I will stay at a room where housekeeping is half ass ever again.
Holy shit! What a dump! Hooters is better than this place. Free wifi (only if you're in the lobby because it exists nowhere else -- free or otherwise -- in the entire hotel. FALSE ADVERTISING.) The beds are crap. There are popcorn ceilings a la my parents' basement in 1979. Everything smells like stripper cocoa butter. The furniture is battered. The elevators feel like communist Russia. The restaurants are food court quality. The clientele is from Nebraska. I called the front desk and had to listen to four options before I was prompted to push 4 to speak to the front desk (I pushed the front desk button on the phone for a reason). I will just not come to Vegas next time if this is the only turd of a hotel left to choose from. I suppose this is what I get for waiting until the last minute, but HOLY GOOD GOD THIS PLACE IS A DUMP. Stay in your car. There are parking garages in Vegas that are better than The Luxor. I slept in my clothes out of fear of touching the bedding. I've stayed in nicer roadside no-tell motels. Ugh. What a mistake.
Worst!! The staff was rude to some of our party, our bathroom was dirty when we arrived, there was cum on our bed (eww), they never brought us extra blankets and our TV was broken. Housekeeping and maintenance were awesome with us though and moved us to a clean room. We will never stay here again.
This was a miserable experience.  We were put in the foot fungus of the hotel, room 4084.  It was near noisy, very noisy elevators, it was dirty, crumbling and the wall paper was peeling.  I found a fingernail in my beer at the aurora bar. When I told the bartenders, they just looked at me and said, "Wow, that's gross." Then they went about their business. I cleaned my straightening iron before I ironed my collar witha small towel.  It had product gunk on it.  I put it on the floor by the door with my other dirty towels.  I go take a shower that night, grab a towel to wash my body and when I open it, it was the gross gunky towel I put on the floor by the door. She took the obviously nasty towel I put on the floor and folded the dirty part on the inside and put it back in the rack!  What if I was checking out? Some other poor fool would have opened that up and probably would have checked out that night (because it looked like feces to be quite honest). I don't think my sheets were regularly changed, as I kept finding my own hair where I slept.  . . When we were put in the awful room, she said sorry we're putting you in this room.  She knew it was a terrible room.  I haven't been so disappointed in a hotel stay in years. I went to the desk to ask about the "resort fee" and she said no matter what it's nonrefundable.  What about the no pool part, I ask.  Oh well she says, non refundable. I never use a gym. Oh well, non refundable.  What about the fact that I didn't use WiFi or make calls.  Oh well she says, non refundable.  This is no way to treat customers.  . . Luxor used to be a name associated with great hotels of Las Vegas.  No more. these guys need to take a hard look at the image they want to put out and what they want people to say about their hotel.  My family lives in Las Vegas so people often ask me for suggestions about where to stay, where to eat, whatever.  They will not be on my recommendation list. . . I'M ALSO INCLUDING PICS OF THE NASTINESS !
This place isn't as bad as its reputation and if you've got kids and a budget, it's a good compromise. . . I enjoyed the themed lobby and felt like the rooms in the tower were fine by normal city hotel standards, but Vegas has a lot of great hotels so when you are comparing to that bar it's below average. . . The biggest cons are that its location is terrible if you don't plan to stay at this hotel and its adjacent hotels. It also doesn't have WiFi but it does have free internet if you can plug in to a single ethernet port. If you've got a family and WiFi devices you'll probably want to bring your own routerto solve this problem.  Bandwidth is limited and cellular access is spotty in the city of Las Vegas, so keep this in mind - online gamers / movie watchers are going to be unhappy campers anywhere in the city.. . You are a reasonable walk from the Mandalay Bay Casino which is one of my favorites in the city and the theme of Luxor and Excalibur are fun for kids.  . . My room was clean and above average but I had to do A LOT of walking in this hotel which became tiresome very quickly.. . If you can spend a few more bucks then the Mandalay Bay or MGM are going to be better overall places to stay, but it'll cost you.. . I went in the winter so I did not explore the pool.
I've stayed here before with family and I remember the experience to be awesome but now staying here first hand with my boyfriend I found it to be an amazing experience! The hotel staff were very friendly and they were very helpful with my late check out and didn't charge us a dime for it. They let us keep our room keys as souvenirs as well! Now the rooms were very clean, well furnished and comfortable. The only thing that sucked is we didn't realize that the room we booked didn't have a fridge or microwave, so the food we brought for bad. I should have read more closely online for the amenities before booking the room. They would of provided us with one but it would an extra charge. No big deal though. Overall my experience was amazing especially for the price we paid, it was a very good deal :) I definetly recommend staying at the luxor for vacation !
This hotel isn't too bad. You can definitely tell it's one of the older hotels in the strip unless you stay in the newer building. The only good thing about it is the tram from Excalibur and Mandalay bay.
Wanted to save some money on hotel this time so I looked up deals on TravelZoo.com and this one was probably the best deal. Never stayed here before and took our chance with it for like $70/night and it was OK. Kind of outdated but clean and close to the strip since you can either take the tram or the passage to Excalibur and then a cab or the Monorail from MGM to anywhere pretty much. Wifi reception is bad in the room, just go to any restaurants and enjoy a drink too.
The Luxor is obviously supposed to be dreary and gloomy since it is imitating a pyramid. But... it just doesn't work for a themed hotel/resort casino. It just feels off, especially with everything else The Strip has to offer. Even just walking through here is kind of dreadful so I just avoid the southern part of The Strip all together (sorry, Mandalay Bay!). I'd recommend staying at other hotels; the room rates may be cheaper here, but I think you can find some comparable prices at much better hotels on The Strip.
Stay away. The line just to check in was 20 minutes long and the staff felt as thought that's ok. Too many more details to complain about. The single worst hotel I ever stayed at.
I visited this hotel as a free gift from a time share presentation, so I can not comment on price at all, except for the 20 dollar a day resort, which I thought is kind of absurd realizing the billions this place probably profits a year, but what can we do? I stayed 3 days. . The property is right next to Mandalay Bay, so parking was a little confusing, but we got the hang of it.. The signs getting to check in are pretty clear. The woman and check in was very pleasant.. We stayed on the 18th floor, well away from the hustle and bustle noise of the casino. The hotel surprisingly was not filled with an overwhelming smell of smoke like places. . WORD TO THE WISE: Please suggest a room near the elevator! My room was quite a trek from the elevator, and having to carry things made it even longer!. The room was clean, smelled clean. The bathroom did not make me want to crawl and we had an amazing view of the Sphinx, Las Vegas Blvd and MGM Grand, on midnight Friday night I was able to view a fantastic 10 minute firework show happening above MGM Grand. I exhausted my search online to find the reason of this show and the only thing I could find was the grand opening of Rose.Rabbit.Lie, an entertainment, dinner show, bar, mash up of some sort, Anyway the view was amazing. I was up watching the sunset when I could.. . This Hotel has it all. Food Court. Bar. Nighclub. Steakhouse. Blackjack. Poker. Slots.. Seems like a good place for the 21 to foxy 40s crowd, hence the numerous bars and nightclubs here.. We did visit the nightclub, but the is another review.. Clean room, great ambiance for the young.. I heard a couple next to me being charged 700 for a few nights, so I am not sure I would pay to stay, but if you find a deal on Vegas.com, go for it!
Check-in: . =====. . My check-in took a bit of time. While the line wasn't long and there were several lines open, it seemed some people were closing their lines. When I finally checked in, I had to pay the resort fee upfront - $67.20 - via debit/credit card. After I was set, the check-in teller provided me a map of the hotel and told me where to find the West Tower, where I was upgraded to (complimentary). . . Finding My Room:. =========== . . Okay, so here's the thing... I got lost. I went to the 5th floor with all my bags and walked around the entire pyramid before I realized I didn't go to the West Tower. I had to . . My View: . ======. . In my room... there's none. Oh, look, the slate gray roof from the casino floor. Bwahahahha. . . Tender: . =====. . I used my $20 food credit to eat here. I had the Pumpkin Ravioli and Baked cookies. Mmm delicious. . . Booklet: . ======. . Usually booklets are full of crappy coupons that are useless. I used the $20 food and beverage credit I received at check-in and ate dinner at Tender the first night I was there. I had the Pumpkin Raviolo and the fresh baked cookies and ice cream. The credit covered the bill. As much as I wanted meat, I decided to wait until my first "full" day here to find one of the local buffets. Considering 1-21 is my birthday, I planned to eat at MORE because you'll eat all day for $35 there, and I really plan to do nothing but live and love life on this day. There's coupons for all of the restaurants in the Luxor, some of the shoppes and the lovely $5 Tee shirt coupon. . . . . CASINO: . ========. . I'm not much of a gambler, but the floor is cool. I didn't play anything - yet. However, I am highly annoyed by staff members who try to get you to purchase timeshares. I just tell them "No" and keep it moving. A timeshare is not in my plans. Ever. . . MY ROOM: . =========. . As I stated previously I was given an upgraded room. My room is in the West Tower. Unlike the "basic" Luxor rooms, this one is a full room that doesn't have a weird angle that everyone warned me about. To be clear, I wasn't tripping on having an angled room in the first place, but it was very nice to walk into a full bedroom with 2 nicely made full size beds. The decor was creme brulee and a contemporary deep blue. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath - awesome because I'm hitting up Lush to take a nice long, sexy soak as soon as I get the chance. . . HOWEVER THERE IS NO VIEW. . . You have to pay for the view ... so my upgrade had me looking at the concrete roof of the casino or something. I don't really think I care about the view ... but if you're interested in a room with a view, just know it will cost more. (Same if you want a room with a "normal" ceiling.) . . THE BATHROOM IS SPACIOUS - BATH TUB AND GLASS SHOWER ARE NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER BUT SEPARATED. : . . INTERNET ACCESS: . ================. . You only have a gray wired ethernet cord for your room. At first this bothered and worried me. I thought I'd have to push back my trip and go to another hotel - Tropicana - instead. However, I discovered that the cord actually stretches to one of the beds and even the table in my room. And so, that, coupled with the fact that I'm here alone - it's NOT as BIG of a deal unless your laptop does NOT have an Ethernet hookup. (I have a MacBook pro).
Nos alojamos en este hotel de Las Vegas porque, a pesar de que es bastante lujoso y esta en el Strip, es muy asequible comparado con el resto. . . El hotel es grande pero sin llegar a ser la enormidad que son los otros del Strip, y esta muy bien decorado: la estructura principal es una piramide con una esfinge, y toda la decoracion de dentro, ascensores incluidos, tiene motivos egipcios. Las habitaciones son muy amplias, estan limpias, y las camas son gigantes y bastante comodas. Eso si, teniendo en cuenta el precio y que hay que pagar un suplemento de "resort", no hay WiFi y las comidas de las tiendas de dentro del hotel (hay locales de comida rapida, cafeterias, restaurantes de buffet libre...) son bastante caras.. . La piscina es enorme y esta muy cuidada (tiene tambien varios jacuzzis).. . El hotel tiene casino (que no es de los mas caros de Las Vegas) y varias atracciones temporales (espectaculos de magia, showgirls, exposiciones...).

I paid for the all day buffet... I did breakfast and dinner. I was able to get full but I wasn't impressed with the food. Tender has amazing vegetarian - or at least non-meat- based dishes. With that said, I ate what I could and kept it moving. I can see why people weren't satisfied when they came here. It's just... not great for $35... but if you want to avoid starvation, it will do. ;). . TIMESHARE PEOPLE:. =================.  Up and down the Vegas strip you have people offering you all kinds of incentives to go to timeshare presentations in Vegas. Nevermind the fact that nobody gives a FAQ about timeshares anymore... much less the need to pay $20,000 for the ownership of a room for one week every 1 or 2 years, . . When you walk the casino floor, there are timeshare people. When you try to go eat food, there are timeshare people. When you go to the gift store, there are timeshare people. These momofukus are like roaches. . . I'm not even 30 but they'll hound you until you tell them you're not 30. Then they hound you to see if you're here as a couple because they can show couples a tour and then offer show tickets. . . Look, Lauryn will just pay for the tickets to the shows she wants, avoid all your stupid contracts and keep it moving. I don't even give a damn about free when it comes at a price like that. . . EVENING CALL: Probably the best thing here... get your Luxor book, use your $20 credit, get your $5 t shirt then come here and get your free shot in your drinks. Bartenders give free samples of the daiquiris. It's amazing and delicious. I love it. I like Straw Bama, the Call Girl and the Mai Tai. Jaegerbomb i
This place is a dump. No wifi in the room, rooms are dumpy, small and dirty with no view,  the internet cable is nextto the tv, and the desk where the lap top is, is across the room on the other side, so the internet cable has to be strung across the room. Guest services are extremely rude and unhelpful. I guess you get what you pay for. Food in their Deli, which is the only place open to eat after midnight was digusting. And finally to top it off, the pillows and the sheets were stained.
Though not the fanciest of the vegas hotels, it is by far not the worst (that is reserved for stratosphere).The room did have a few "dings" in the furniture but was clean and easy access,while the ground floor had view of the street it made easy to come and go without fighting with an elevator.. . STAY AWay from the buffet...food is cold and waitor rude.. . BUT the T&T mexican resturant is a gem.Alicia our server was the absolute BEST!!!        . and we loved the food.. . The tram didnt stop at luxor anymore so it was alot more walking.. . The deli had the best sanwiches!!. . But the best part was between mlife and the myvegas promos we only paid 66.00 for the 4 nites in the suite.
stayed here at least 20 times, love it. great place to party
It's Ok not great but ok
We stayed in the hotel for a full week and loved our room. I have to admit I read a ton of reviews and was really nervous. Ive decided to offer some advice on what I learned. First and most important, the pyramid rooms are old...just simply ask for an upgrade to a tower room. The majority of the time in vegas hotels offer free upgrades. We got a tower room upgrade for free but I wanted more space so I pushed on and finally was offered a tower suite for $50 extra a night. I almost took it but I knew that they have a bigger suite called the premire suite. I told the front desk I really wanted it and the lady gave me an upgrade to the premire. I was great, very beautiful and comfortable. I believe like 1200sqft. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms with living room and kitchenette and dining area. So when you book online just book the cheapest and get upgraded when u get there. The casino was ok....we never won much at all. Its nice though and not too smokey and just the right size. The only thing I didn't like was parking so far away in the back. I figured out its actually closer to park at the excaliber and walk to the luxor instead of using the luxor parking. Also VERY IMPORTANT....there is more then one check in area. On the first floor there is a smaller area with no waiting....don't go to the main check in and wait 30 min when u can go downstairs and be helped right away. We never ate in the hotel because foods over priced. Its just too easy to find a normal place down the road.
