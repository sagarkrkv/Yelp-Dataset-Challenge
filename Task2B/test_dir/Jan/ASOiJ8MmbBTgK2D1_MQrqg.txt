The environment is great: great view, beautiful restaurant, good tasting food. The char broiled fillet would have been a 10 if it wasn't so burnt on the outside. They could have left it sitting in some of it's juices for 56 dollars.. . For the amount I paid for the fillet, chicken, and side of potatoes ($128 including tip), I expected better service from my waiter. His description of the fillet when I asked about how it comes, "It's literally a piece of meat on a plate", didn't sound very appetizing. When he asked if I wanted a side of potatoes, he never even told me how they would come. (They ended up being potatoes au gratin) Again, the fillet was burnt on the outside which didn't make me too happy.. . For that kind of money, I want excellent service.
Great view, food, and service. My GF and I went here to celebrate my return home from deployment. Wonderful experience!
Totally bad service,  and bad food!!!  The waiter totally doesnt care if we are satisfied with the food or not,  all whole dishes of vension on the table we didnt eat,  the waiter just took away our dishes without asking if there anything wrong with it and just walked away.  This place is worse than many other restaurants!  And i wouldnt come back again,  ever!!
Came here for my bday and did the vegetarian tasting menu. Beautiful view and ambience. Love that they OFFER vegetarian tasting menus, table behind us was also inquiring, vegetarians are foodies too! Service was on point.  With tasting menus timing and dish descriptions are imperative,  both were there. Not the 5th star because the food didnt have me begging for more.. Im a stickler for table maintenance and the busser did a great job. Restaurants of this caliber stand out because of attention to detail. Only detail missed were un polished plates. Didnt ruin my meal or anything, but finger prints and marks were glowing under the lighting of our table.. . If you've never been its worth checking out!
Beautiful decor with metal structure of the tower throughout the dining area.  Elevator to the restaurant has you walk past the kitchen to the upstairs host stand.  I have eaten here twice now, once for dinner many years ago and this time for lunch.  Both times the price is obviously steap but for the ambiance, atmosphere, food quality and service provided it is definitely worth every penny!  Would definitely recommend as a place to dine and overlook the Bellagio fountains!
What a great view this restaurant has! I was there for a Valentines day dinner,pretty pricey, I remember it was around $400 for two ppl , but how cared about money with such a great atmosphere? Love the place , love the service,not the best food i had though. If you are looking for a romantic type of place , you are in the right spot! I will post a picture here!
Tried to go back for our 6 year anniversary with a party of 18 and its:. $125 MINIMUM PER PERSON. 8.1 tax (completely understandable). 20% service charge (what). $500 deposit!!!!!!! (-_-). Are you kidding me. I enjoyed the experience last time. Will never go back again.
Take the elevator up to one of the greatest restaurants in all of Vegas.  You are thinking that a restaurant inside the replica Eiffel Tower outside the Paris Casino would be a bit tacky....and it kinda is.  But, the food is the best you will find.  The view from the restaurant is one of the best you will find.  . . TIP ALERT!  In order to increase your chances of seating for the best views go as a party of two.  They have a ton of 2 party seating tables near the window where you will have the best views of the Bellagio Fountains. /END TIP ALERT. . Now onto the food. Nice selection of steaks and seafood.  This restaurant is classic French...not American and French fusion BS....but French.  I don't know what some of the other reviewers are smoking, but this is class French.  They have an appetizer of various seafood in a bucket that could feed about 4....so if you want an appetizer for your party of 4 then grab it.  OR...if you have a party of 5 and one of those 5 would have anaphylactic shock from eating seafood...then get it and feed the 4 and inform the 5th person that they need to be a man and get over their allergy.  Mainly because they are missing out on some expertly prepared seafood.  Shrimp can be prepared in many horrible ways.  Tough or mushy are the usual consequences of this horrible preparation.  Tender is what you are looking for...and these shrimp were the best.  Also, try the snapper.  I am not lying when I say it was perhaps the best fish I have ever had.  The waiter was very helpful as well with suggesting a sauce that covered the fish.  It was more like a broth, but was poured over the top. The broth/sauce had the taste of the ocean....but crystal clear ocean....not BP oil spill tainted ocean.. . Dessert.....holy crap.  This is where the restaurant really shines.  I tried the Napoleon.  Get the raspberry...it tastes better and is somehow more romantic than the pear.  It contains a icy bit of sorbet as well that is amazing.  Just give me a bucket of that sorbet!  Another member of our party had the creme brule.  Expertly prepared.  Rich, creamy, and classy.  Honestly....3 people with 3 desserts and appetizer was below $250.  Not too bad really compared to other high-end restaurants.  I really thought this restaurant would be a mistake tourist trap waiting to happen but I was pleasantly surprised.. . My suggestions:. 1) Go as a party of two. You and your girl, or guy, or whatever....go as a party of two. Ask for a window seat to see the fountain as you eat.. 2) If you have a bigger party then grab the bucket of seafood appetizer.. 3) Get the snapper or the beef wellington.  Those were amazing.. 4) Put on a blindfold and pick a dessert by throwing a dart at the menu.  You cannot go wrong with anything.. 5) Leave your preconceived notions of tackiness and tourist-trappedness behind.  This is the real deal.
Love this place!!!! My best friend's boyfriend proposed to her here so it's even more especial to me. The way the ring was presented and bought to the table was breath taking. The ambiance is very romantic . We came here for dinner and the view from out table was amazing we could see the Belagio fountain. . . The food was pretty good but I loved their deserts especially the chocolate souffle.... . Will definitely go back when I visit  Las Vegas again.
