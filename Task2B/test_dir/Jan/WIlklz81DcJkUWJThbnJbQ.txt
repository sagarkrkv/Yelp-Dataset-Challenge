Booked 4 rooms.  Only one of rooms was ready at 3PM as promised.  Waited in the lobby for 2 hours to check in.  After receiving key, attempted to enter room but key failed.  Went all the way to lobby, waited in line, and received new key.  Went back up and all the way to end of hall and attempted to enter again.  Key failed again.  Waited 30m or more for security, still waiting.. . I will not book here again, period.. . Edit:  Security personnel arrived and finally got in.
My husband and I are retired professionals and long time mLife members who travel frequently to Las Vegas (10-12 times per year). We typically stay at the MGM but have recently begun to explore the other MGM properties. We have enjoyed Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Aria, and The Signature. This year, we booked a penthouse at the Vdara for a 4-day, New Year's Eve stay. While the staff was extremely gracious and helpful and the room was furnished stylishly, we were very disappointed with what we encountered once we settled in. We had to request the basic amenities - washcloths were not provided, the mini-bar was empty (although we never use it, we didn't want to be charged for the missing items), the bathrobes had no belts/ties, the kitchen had no cleaning supplies (dish towels, soap, dishwasher soap). We were provided with wine glasses upon request, but were told there would be a charge for providing champagne flutes. We asked three times for paper towels but could not get them so we had to use the bathroom towels to dry our dishes.  The 2-quart trashcan in the kitchen did not even hold a small take-out containers so trash had to be placed on the floor. Coffee was provided but no sugar/creamer packets were included.A washer and dryer came with the room, but no laundry soap. Although we requested the missing items, we only received the washcloths, dish soap and wine glasses.. . The bathroom has almost no counter space for toiletries. Although we were encouraged to save energy and reuse our bathroom towels, there was only one small hook over the sink (no towel racks at all). The Internet, while "free" with the $25-per day resort free, took more than 20 minutes each day to establish he 1Mbs connection. We are not picky people, but were surprised that Vdara chose style without considering the essentials. We certainly would not classify this as a penthouse experience nor a Forbes 4-Star Hotel as the advertising indicated. Needless to say, we will not stay at Vdara again. For those looking for a condo-like experience, we highly recommend the Signature at MGM. All of the basic amenities are provided at check-in (washcloths, kitchen supplies, etc. coffee, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper), the bathroom, living room, kitchen and bedroom are far more spacious and less costly than Vdara.
Vdara is a non-smoking property without a casino.  If this is cool with you, then continue to read.. . Well I was really excited until I saw my room.  If you're thinking it's Vegas and it's going to be amazing, it's not.  It's nice enough with a microwave and small fridge, but this is nothing like what you've seen on any reality tv show.. . The bathroom had great lighting which is something that most hotel bathrooms lack.  And the shower had a seat built into the wall in case you have the need to sit.. . The bed is on one side of the room divided by a wall with a television on the bed side and a dimly lit sitting area on the other side.. . Vdara has a small gym which has rather inconvient hours---6 to 6, I believe.  If you'd like to eat, you'll need to go out or visit the very lame cafe downstairs--they don't have many options.
This is the first time I've ever stayed at Vdara. It is a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel and resort. As an M Life member, I got a good deal on the room, so I decided to check it out. I arrived early in the morning and was able to check in with no problem well before "check in time.". . The room is more like a suite. It had a cooktop, a fridge, and a separate seating area with its own TV. The decor was modern and looked great. The wall of windows is certainly en vogue as well. The bathroom was large with a separate glass shower.. . The only complaint I'd have is that in the morning and at night I could hear music from something nearby. I thought I was high enough up, but apparently not. That wouldn't, however, keep me from staying there again.. . Finally, it was pretty easy to get around from Vdara using the monorail that connects from the Bellagio through Vdara to Aria/Monte Carlo. The Vdara is a comfortable respite from the craziness of Vegas and I'd definitely recommend it.
I stayed here for New Years Eve, and it was quite expensive and worth the day! . . Watch out though, if you don't know what high-end is..it means that you tip for everything! Here's a list: . . 1. valet (stay and leave). 2. bellhop service (pick up and drop off) . 3. absolutely anything brought to your room. . . I do have to add that the customer service is excellent though! Even with all the tip service! . . downstairs in the lobby, there is a small bar/dance area and a seating area. there's also a coffee shop. the whole first floor is small and everything can easily be seen from anywhere you stand. . . it's a short walk to the Bellagio and then to the strip, or you can use the tram in Bellagio to head the opposite way. . . it's a very clean hotel, very simplistic furniture to cater to the high volume of rich clients they pull in. the room is the same way, minimalist furniture with a ton of space.
I absolultely adore this hotel, mostly because it is non-gaming and smells like flowers, not smoke! As soon as you walk in, you notice a pleasant almost jasmine scent that causes you to want to walk into the hotel rather than turn around and run away, which is how I often feel when I walk into a smoky hotel.. . The staff is always friendly, and both times I have stayed here, the staff accomodated an early check-in. If you have to wait for a few minutes, you can enjoy an Illy coffee or latte at the market cafe' in the lobby or sit in one of the comfy chairs.. . One of my other favorite things about this hotel is that you don't have to walk through a casino to get to your hotel room, the elevators are right next to the check-in area! The rooms are all spacious suites, and there is plenty of room to spread out, set out your clothes, and store luggage. The bathrooms are spacious as well, and I love that everything always smells wonderful, not matter where you are in the hotel.. . The beds are comfortable, and the towels are large and fluffy. The bathtubs are enormous, and I love the glass rain showers. This is the perfect hotel if you are looking for something in the best location (perfectly in the center of the strip next to the Cosmopolitan, Aria, Bellagio, etc.) without the smoky smell of hotels with casinos. . . In late spring and fall, the pool is perfect. It's not overly noisy like some of the other pools, rather, it is relaxing and the service is always spot-on. This really is my new go-to hotel in Vegas.
Loved this place! Got upgraded as soon as we got there! Then got to extend our stay for the same price we paid the night before but for a penthouse! LOVED that their was no casino! And no smoking was good too! I would deff come back here.
Got the panoramic suite for my and my girlfriend and it was perfect.. . This suite is has a total apartment/condo feel with room, living area, kitchen, and bath all sectioned off.  Search around Youtube for a walkthrough.. . I never get room service, but figured experiencing it wouldn't hurt and surprisingly the food they offered at this hotel was superb!  . . What I love most about this room is that it is still on the strip, but pushed back a bit which takes you away from all the chaos.  Also this is a non-smoking hotel with no casino.  LOVE THAT!. . It is valet-only, but is complimentary.  I did tip them, but at the end of my stay.  The longest you'll wait for your car is about 10 minutes, but I'd say the longest I've ever had to wait even during checkout was 5 minutes.. . Such a great suite!!!
We recently stay here for three nights. The hotel is really built to be condos, but I guess they couldn't sell it and converted it to hotels. There's a full kitchen in our unit and even laundry. It's good for family and kids. We got a suite and unlike some of the suites we stayed at, the door to the bedroom does close completely to shut out the sound. I also like how it's directly connected to the Bellagio and we got a view of the Bellagio fountain from our room, which was pretty cool. it's walkable to all the casinos near by, which is really convenient. . . the decor is a bit more masculine, but I guess it's ok. we had a couple of hiccups with the staff, they don't seem to know a lot of the stuff. I hope they will get better as they become more experienced.
Booked two deluxe suites for veteran's day weekend and when I got there to check-in, they told me that there weren't anymore deluxe or vdara suites available due to a sudden surge of customers arriving for a conference. Bummer! . . But, they asked, if we would like to be upgraded to a two bedroom hospitality suite  instead? Score! Thanks for the excellent service, Vdara! This was definitely a great start to a fantastic weekend :)
Vegas living! Let's face it. When you're going to Vegas you're hardly going for a cushy bed and a relaxing spa experience. You're pretty much going to test the limits of your liver (in public) and return home with empty pockets. In that respect the Vdara is everything - and more - that you might need from a hotel.. . I'm writing this review imagining my hotel needs from a more regular sort of vacation. The Vdara is relatively new and right off the strip, the sister hotel to the more well known Aria. The location is right in the middle of the action, and most large spotsare walking distance; the Bellagio is connected in a back passageway. The facilities are clean and modern, and the gym is the best I've seen in a hotel. Iced towels, personal water bottles, any machine you might need, leather seats embroidered with "The Vdara.". . As for the room, we stayed in a suite. The bed is up to par but the roll it sofa bed is seriously thin and wiry. If you have the misfortune to draw that straw, be sure to call room service and request a mattress pad (or two). The suite comes with a bathroom and a half, with the half bath having no towel rack. How are you supposed to dry your hands? Neither bathroom has a fan. The shower pressure is weak and the hotel shampoo/conditioner isn't great. Any girl should BYO. It seemed like a strange mix of luxury and flaws, since the suite had all the aforementioned issues while having a fancy Keurig coffee maker, a stove and a jumbo refrigerator complete with ice maker. Not sure how much use you'd get out of that in Vegas, but there you go. Overall the hotel is nice but could use some more thought invested in the utility of their setup.
Employing an automatic one star reduction for all hotels that invoke a mandatory "resort" fee for items (internet, newspaper, use of the property) that Motel 6 provides for free. Just include it in the price people.. Regular room very nice. Awesome to have a kitchen, we had groceries delivered from Vons/Safeway to avoid having to go out for all meals. Non-smoking non-gaming environment appreciated while having several casinos within quick walking distance.. Gym very nice if a bit small, but had everything one could wish for at a hotel gym.. One minor downside was the pool area. Fairly nice but the towels they handed out were threadbare, and the service there was a little lackluster (ie not keeping the place clean and tidy). Another was the housecleaning was a little below 5 star service (forgot to empty trash one day, didn't replace washcloths on another).. All in all, a fairly nice place.
This is a lovely tranquil hotel on the strip. . Its one of the newest as it was built as part of the new city center and all though it is pretty central on the strip you hardly sense it. . . It has no casino but the value you get for a suite is unbelievable. We had a Panoramic Suite for less than $120 per night. . . The view was phenomenal. . . My one nag would be that it is VERY difficult to find the pedestrian entrance at night... especially if you have had a few drinks!
4/5 = room . 1.5/5 = service. averaging to 3/5 stars. . . For the holidays, i came to vdara with my family. I was excited. I heard great things about Vdara and was totally down for something fancy, and experienced some ups and downs. . . THE GOOD:. 1.) Chic and modern rooms. They look nice, prim, and hip! . 2.) Kitchen with stove, microwave, and fridge. For some reason our fridge had two opening doors, but one of the doors was locked, giving us a tiny space for fridge. Kind of annoying, but no bigs.. 3.) remote controlled blinds and shades for windows. You feel pretty damn fancy and upscale with that shizz. . 4.) bathrooms are very nice. . 5.) Basically the feel of the room, even the most basic room, feels fancy and nice! . 6.) NO CASINOS and no smoking. So none of that headache, weaving in and out of slots and tables and all that las vegas madness you see everywhere. . . THE BAD (or annoying):. 1.) Youneed your key at all times to enter the hotel rooms. There are people checking at the elevators to see if you have a key, which makes bringing guests into a room quite a hassle. . . THE UGLY:. 1.) MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! (SEE A, B, and C). .         A.) We had two rooms reserved. Our check in time was 3pm. At 3 pm, one of the rooms was not ready. Guess when they were ready. at 9pm!!!!!! YES, you read that right! 9 FREAKING PM!!!! Rather than providing us with a discount, they offered $60 room service credit, which we weren't even really interested in. AND guess what? After all that extra time, the room had trash still in it. It was not clean. WTF. .        B.) We had no body come into clean our rooms during our 2 night stay. . .        C.) We needed extra bedding, and requested face-to-face at the front desk for it. They said that the would expedite our request. 30 minutes later...nothing. We called the front desk Guess what they said? Some BS story about how they are understaffed. That is NOT our problem! Plus this was a day or two after Jan 1, how they heck are they understaffed and not prepared for a large influx of people during the holidays? and when we asked for an ETA...guess what they said? Oh..THERE IS NO ETA! They could not give us an estimated time of arrival of when they could bring us bedding. we were exhausted and were basically waiting on that to sleep! It took 45 minutes for the bedding to arrive. So much for expediting. We also asked front desk for another item, which took about 30 minutes to arrive. . . 2.) There were trashbags at all times in the hallway. It's kind of annoying to walk down the halls of a seemingly nice hotel, with trash bags filled with trash lining the hallway.. . CONCLUSION. Basically the bad stained my experience of what could have been a good one! the rooms were nice, but when you get crappy service along with that...it kind of poos poos on your experience.
I like this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. A little grocery Store is available at the lobby. Rooms are clean and good looking. 4 Star because the pool is pretty small and not very deep.lol. Items for sale are a bit expensive as well. (Well, I understand why but still.).  Overall: it's a good hotel. Ohhh.. I forgot the tram (free) and a way to go to the bellagio's lobby without going out on the street. I like it
I have stayed here twice now - once for pleasure and once for business - and was pleased with my experience both times.. The rooms are GORGEOUS. I recently had the opportunity to stay in the Corner Suite, and it exceeded my expectations. The room featured an unparalleled strip view of the Bellagio fountains, a full kitchen with dining table/stove/dishwasher, a washer/dryer, a huge living room, an incredibly comfortable bed, a large soaking tub, and a really nice vanity area.. I will say that if you are here for pleasure, navigating around the strip can be a little tricky due to an odd location and unmarked pedestrian entrances. And reception at the front desk is hit or miss. My last check-in agent was pretty rude when I asked for a late check-out, and essentially told me that nobody at the hotel could help me. Other than that, I really like this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
It's funny, sometimes when you find yourself whining and bitching like a little baby, it seems so appropriate at the time, then some time after, you really feel like a freaking idiot.. . My assistant booked a stay here for business, and did it on Hotwire.  In general, when booking a 5-star Hotel using their service I'm usually fine with her doing it and don't care.  In this case, I was livid.  A Hotel with no casino in Vegas?  Blasphemy.  A Hotel not directly on the strip?  Well my God I might as well have booked in LA and driven to the strip.  A Hotel with no club?  Impossible.. . In fact I was so pissed I got on the phone with them and, "blah blah blah, I'll never use your service again, you are the worst thing to happen to humanity, etc, etc; insert some tears and expletives; blah blah blah".......and still stuck there.. . Then post stay, revert back to paragraph 1.  Not the first time nor the last I've made a horses a*s out of my self and then had to admit it later in my own mind.. . I absolutely loved the Hotel.  The rooms are modern and gorgeous.  The pool and spa areas are excellent.  And ultimately not having a Casino there when you are Zombie walking back to your room is not only refreshing, but probably saved me more money than I care to admit in not wasting money at tables in a state where you have no business even being awake.  No smoke, no noise, no nonsense.  No getting sucked back in for multiple more cocktails you don't need.  It's like an island respite in the middle of the madness, which was just really, really refreshing.. . And my concern of it being in "Antarctica"?  Its a 2 second walk from Aria.  Also getting cabs/transpo out was a breeze, as you don't have a million wastoids in line from the casino.. . I would definitely stay again.
I was very excited to finally get the chance to experience City Center during my last trip to LV. When I moved away from the area, City Center was still just a much of scaffolding with a couple pieces of glass on it. To see it finished, and be able to stay at Vdara, was truly a treat.. . Checking in late on a Wednesday I never expected an upgrade to a corner suite, but sure enough I got one! Oh boy, how can I ever stay in a regular hotel room again? Full kitchen, washer and drier, large living room separated from the bedroom by beautiful smoked glass doors, and (my favorite) separate soaking tub and glassed in shower. Sooo nice. I couldn't have asked not more. Even though our view wasn't that amazing from the 6th floor facing the parking garage, it just didn't matter with all the luxury around us. Truly a beautiful room!. . My only complaints with Vdara would be the room cleaning service and the fitness center. On 3 out of the 5 days during my stay all my wash cloths were taken but not replaced. Also, after using the 4 glasses and 1 (yes, only 1) mug in the kitchen, they were also taken but not replaced. It was pretty annoying...Then the fitness center so waayyy too small. The 3 times I went it was packed tighter than a can of sardines; no cardio equipment open, no room for functional training. I know vacations aren't supposed to be about working out - most of the time - but I really would have appreciated a more conducive place to my fitness. . . Overall my experience was wonderful. I would stay again without hesitation. Believe what others say about this being a hotel you can actually sleep at in LV. It was very quiet. On the 6th floor I only heard trucks in the morning; nothing at night. If you're like me and don't go to LV for the nightlife, you'll love this just as much as I did. . . Get a room! Ask for an upgrade. You won't be disappointed!
Love this hotel, I have stayed here twice now. It's clean, the bed was amazing, and it's close to the Aria, Cosmo and Bellagio. My only complaint is the shower door leaks water every time you use it due to poor design. But just throw some towels down and you're all set! I will definitely be staying here again.
Great Job Vdara! . . Recently stayed here for two nights and had a fantastic time. The best part about the Vdara is, after a long tiring day, you come back to a super clean room where you can breathe GOOD QUALITY AIR. Staying in a non-smoking hotel makes such a difference in the quality of sleep. Super comfy beds and much more reasonably priced than the Aria or Cosmo. I really enjoyed the ESPA even though the couples massage was an arm and a leg. But you do get what you pay for and the treatment was bliss. Super friendly staff willing to go the extra mile, (even when asking where the $3 craps tables are). The only issue is the Vdara is slighly off the strip, so you do have to walk through the Aria or the Bellagio to get to the main LV Blvd. Its worth the few extra steps. . . Highly recommend it if you want a more quiet, smaller hotel, with high quality service and CLEAN AIR. . . Thanks Vdara.
I love this hotel! Thank goodness its not crazy in here. Really close to cosmo and aria. LOVE THE VIEW!
