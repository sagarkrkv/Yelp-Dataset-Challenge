People who watch Absinthe should have a high tolerance for racist/political/no-holds-barred humor - especially if you're buying the seats near the center stage. There were definitely a few in the audience that were more conservative, and it was amazingly entertaining to see how uncomfortable they were.. . The show is a great mix of acrobatics and burlesque with a fun series of acts strung together well by transitional comedy skits. Everything felt polished and put together, and the unique set-up of an intimate circular tent with seating surrounding a center stage meant that almost every seat had a great view. . . At a little over an hour, it did feel a bit short, but overall great. I saw both Zumanity and Absinthe and prefer Absinthe by a large margin. Check out the Tix4Tonight booths scattered throughout the strip for cheaper tickets if you're not planning on booking ahead of time (our discount was ~30%) for a 10 minute wait in line.
My friend described this show as cirque du soleil meets Rocky Horror Picture Show and I couldn't agree more. There are almost bare naked girls, acrobatics, stunts, etc. Most of all the host is Extremely funny. He will curse, make lots of provocative jokes, racist jokes (all in good fun though). He'll poke fun at caucasions, hispanics, asians, you name it. If you are conservative and traditional, please save us the scowl face and don't go!
Hands down best show I have ever seen and I've seen plenty. Would definitely go see this again. Lots of laughs and amazing acts. Didn't want the show to end. The venue is very intimate which makes for an amazing experience
"Raunchy" is the most accurate description. Absinthe means "strong and bitter.". . After seeing this, we were shocked by the ratings of 4 & 5. The four of us agreed this was the raunchiest of shows and the humor was mean-spirited to the point that it was not enjoyable. My husband and I have seen many shows; the two people we attended with have seen most of the shows (as they live in LV). . . The "humor' was a lot about body parts and body fluids. We could not understand why the ratings were so high. We then realized that for the 20's, young, juvenile humor, drinking crowd this was great. (Look at the photos that accompany the ratings . . most very young.) The acrobatics were good, not great. The seats were uncomfortable, wood, folding-type chairs. . . Pay attention to the reviews, the term 'adult humor' words is not used because it is too mild of a term. Terms 'perverted' and 'dirty humor' were used for good reason. If you enjoy okay acrobatics, the lowest form of reality television, raunchiness, and humor based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, degrading others, and race, this is the show for you. If you expect great talent and an adult humor, burlesque-like show, pass on Absinthe.. . I should have looked up the meaning of the word before attending, "Absinthe:  a green alcoholic drink that has a very strong and bitter flavor; green liqueur which is flavored with wormwood, anise, and other aromatic herbs and commercial production of which is banned in many countries for health concerns."  . . The show is "strong and bitter". Even if we did enjoy the humor, the tickets would have been over-priced based on the talent levels.
We literally ran across Las Vegas Blvd then ran around Caesar's trying to get tickets and get into the show in time because we just decided about 10 minutes before the show started that we wanted to go.  Luckily they still had some seats in the back row, which is only the 8th row, so we were still pretty darn close to everything.  The theatre is round, it was very cozy and much different from any other Cirque show I have ever seen.. . I won't spoil the plot aspects at all but the show is hilarious, involving lots of poking fun at various members of the crowd.  I was really blown away by the acrobatics, we also saw Zumanity and although that was impressive, Absinthe really blew it away.. . I often shy away from spending a lot of money on show tickets but this one is worth it.
First,  there were no available tickets for cirque shows so this was just our second choice, and we were glad we opted to watch Absinthe. Second, we got a discounted price from the tix for tonight booth. The show is held in the tent in front of the caesar's palace, a small, intimate location. The stage is at the center and up close no matter where you sit. The acts and performance are all great, HILARIOUS, crazy, raunchy, and very funny. I never laughed this hard that I almost passed out!!! The only reason why im taking one star off is because of uncomfortable seating - small wooden chairs so close and cramped up to each other. But overall, Absinthe is very entertaining!
I love the acts by the various acrobats, but hated the ringmaster and Dorothy because they were annoying as hell. I think they over did it with all the F-bombs and stupid jokes. . . The various acts were interesting and some were quite breathe taking. I'm not sure if I'd come back again though.. . Regarding seats, there's no real bad seats, but I do recommend you sit up in the first row. You'll get picked on and what not and it's funny.
One of the best shows I've ever seen! I was totally entertained the entire time. The only complaint I had was that the specialty drinks they were walking around and selling were full of whiskey, and I hate that stuff. BUT! There was a bar where you can get whatever you want. :) . I had an amazing time, and so did everyone I went with! . I will see it again and again. . . ~Rachael
Love, Love, LOVE this show. Intimate setting, excellent decor, costumes, music. The ambiance was spot on. If I were a gazillionaire and someone put together a dream performance for me this would have been spot on! Various acts, F bombs, totally off color but the performers being so close adds a WOW factor that I haven't found with my other Vegas shows. . There is nothing PC in this show so if that is a problem skip it. . I picked up my discount ticket day of show when the box office opened at noon. My hotel concierge told me it was sold out but I walked over anyway. Very glad I did. Got an excellent single seat and graciously accepted the discount cards they were handing out in front of tent.
I've been a few Cirque shows and I was still blown away by the power and beauty of all the acts!  It's true what they say in all the reviews and there is no bad seat since each the tent is so intimate.  . . There's plenty of f*bombs, gay jokes, nudity, and the word "penis" being shouted so if you're faint of heart this show is not for you. 5 stars for the breathtaking acts and humor.
This show is really fun and the acts are amazing!  The variety of performances were very entertaining.  I was truly amazed at the beautiful performers and the acrobatic skill. I laughed so hard I nearly cried !   The soundtrack to the show was really well put together; I especially liked that they played songs by Christina Perri and Tegan & Sara.  . A bit about the show: even if you are not offended easily,  you could be pushed a bit to the limit.  I did not enjoy the fact that the show was geared so much towards the male audience and that only one of the male performers was really nice looking, as the majority of the female performers were exceptionally beautiful.  The use of negative racial "humor' was quite extensive.  .  Still this show is not to be missed!
Fantastic show! Ambiance was great. Actors were engaging and circus acts were out of the world.  Everything you'd expect in a Las Vegas show and more.  One of my favorite shows that I've seen in Las Vegas!
Wow, stunning in every sense of the imagination. Just a word to the wise though, if you're easily (or even not so easily offended) AVOID this show... Strong sexual content, strong language, strong racial undertones (and overtones) I mean this show is simply offensive in every sense of the word. But tastefully so, it's laugh out loud funny! What's even better, is the comedy is used to get your heart out of your chest after you've just watched some mind bending "cirque" type stunt... . . Atmosphere of the tent, yes it's a tent, is intimate and exciting. If you don't want to be "in the show" DO NOT SIT in the first three rows... you will be ridiculed, called on and probably moistened by the water in some of the acts. . . Would I see this show again? Yes. No Question. Would I see it a third, fourth and fifth time? Yes, yes and yes. . . Spend the money, take the time, check this show out.
My wife and I went to the Friday show and my face still hurts from laughing so much. I would recommend this show to any number of my friends. Although if you have a stick up your butt or your feelings get hurt easily don't go! The humor is raunchy and male locker room style, . . The gazillonaire made fun of everyone and I fit the bill on most of them, butif you cant sit back and laugh at yourself once in awhile than whats the point!. . If your into Porky's style of comedy than this is the place for you. . . Keep up the good work guys
Read the reviews and was hoping for a good show. We were blown away with the mix of talent and humour, it was side splitting funny and awe inspiring. If you got to one show and you don't mind adult humour then this is it. Absolutely incredible!
Excellent show!
I feel the need to start this review by saying that I'm not skilled enough a writer to describe Absinthe with any justice. It's a 90 minute whirlwind experience that takes you from laughter to terror in an instant, over and over again. You will be disoriented, amazed, and probably a little horny after watching it. I such certainly was!. . Being so close the stage had me awestruck during most of the acts. One in particular actually had me wishing to had bought into cheaper section. The crazy German roller skaters scared the living daylights out of me. I instinctively slide down into my seat during one of their stunts, because I feared what might happen to me if the woman slipped out of the rope. Honestly the little inebriated I felt at the beginning of the act was gone by the end. Scared me sober!!. . I've never laughed so hard than at the jokes being rattled off at a dizzying rate by the MCs. Everything you think but just could never utter is the punchline to every joke. In you sit in the front row, be prepared to confront your personal stereotypes in a very theatrical way. No one in that section is safe. The only way I could help to prepare you is to warn that if you are a heterosexual male, do NOT sit next to male. You will be gay for the rest of the show if you do, and the actors will give you an extreme, Las Vegas, gay experience throughout the show. . . I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil it for you! Just get your ticket and go see Absinthe for yourself. You will most likely walk away just as I did and wonder how any other show could top it.
Wow! An equal opportunity offensive ribald vaudeville meets Cirque show! Definitely worth the $ and discounts can be had at Tix4tonight! Only complaint, seats are really hard
This is an absolutely incredible show!  I've been to Vegas numerous times, so I knew I didn't want another Cirque show, I wanted something different and fun.  Not that cirque shows aren't amazing - they are- but this is so beyond a cirque show, I'm in awe.  When I read all the reviews, a part of me was nervous that this was going to be typical, middle-america humor that wasn't actually that funny (think Leno).  But, it is absolutely one of the most hilarious shows I have ever been to and I laughed until I cried.  In fact, that's what you remember the most, laughing.  The acts are great, really, but if you've seen cirque shows, you've seen these types of acts (girl in fabric, high wire, etc.).  Oh, except the roller skaters - you've never seen anything like them and they will blow your mind!!!!  Outrageous!!  And, the "performance piece" by Penny and Mr. Gazillionaire will make you never think of the song, "I Will Always Love You" the same way again.  The host of the show, Mr. Gazillionaire and his co-host, Penny are some of the funniest people I've ever seen live.  Yes, people in the audience are ridiculed, mercilessly and hilariously.  And, yes, some of the jokes are easy, but the cast is so skilled, witty and sharp that every joke lands, every stereotype joke gets a new twist. It is truly no holds barred.   Would I take my mother to this show?  No, I wouldn't.  There are a lot of hard core sex jokes and curse words all over the place.  I know it would be too much for her.  But, for me and my husband, it was the perfect end to our Vegas trip.  See this show if you want some entertainment that is outrageous, hilarious and like nothing Vegas has ever had, in my opinion.  We sat in Row G and it was perfect because we were away from the stage so we didn't get ridiculed, and we were on a riser vs. just on the flat floor.  . . See this show.  It is awesome.
Our last night in Vegas, my wife and I were undecided on what to do.  Being a frequent visitor to Vegas, I've seen most of the Cirque shows and some of the other more popular ones.  I remember seeing the advertisements for this show some years ago before it opened, and it didn't seem to interest me, being that you can see the "big top" arena just outside Ceaser's and the ads made it seem like "circus' acts.  But after reading the reviews online and the fact they gave $20 off for military (regularly $99).  We decided to go see it.  We were not disappointed.  What a great show.  If you're offended by nudity (pasties), racial stereotype jokes, homosexuality, I would stay clear of this show.  Also, if you don't like being picked on (especially if you're of an ethnic race) stay away from the front row.  . . 5 STARS for the comedy aspect of it.  The MC and his "assistant" make this show what it is.  Simply hiliarious.  4 STARS for the "acrobatics" aspects, while most of the acts are things you have seen before at other shows, the fact it's done on a stage smaller than most people's living rooms is pretty amazing.  4.5 STARS for the "entertainment" part of it (singing, sexuality, etc.).  . . There are 3 different price structures, Front row (around the stage), tables along the back wall, and general seating.  All seats are assigned, but they do cram you in there as the place is small but there a no bad seats, the stage is in the center so it really doesn't matter where you sit.    . . We were able to buy tickets at the window 1 hour prior to the show on a Sunday night.  Though it was pretty full there were still some empty seats.  Also, we overheard some people complaining that they purchased tickets through ticketmaster online via the Ceasar's website and were charged quited a bit MORE than what they would have paid by just buying at the window.
I heard about how raunchy it is. I heard that the jokes and lines were all re-used. I heard about the whole "getting picked on".. but never did I imagine I would experience it. . . Didn't help that I sat in a row of asians so definitely stood out and got picked on. Getting one of our group members picked to go up on stage was also a delight. I think that made the show that much more entertaining.. . If you book with a group you can get VIP seating + champagne. Not too shabby and the seats were pretty close to the front. I sat second row from the front and I know that if any of those acts messes up I would probably get kicked in the face.. . I think 1 or 2 acts were kind of boring (as in I've seen them in plenty of other shows) and some other ones were incredible.. . All in all definitely worth watching and it is a lot more entertaining than some Cirque shows.
I'm not generally one for a show, but wow, Absinthe was absolutely incredible. Hysterical, impressive, just a great deal of enjoyment.. . Absinthe is about half raunchy comedy and half acrobatics/gymnastics. None of the acts stretch on too long and so it's a good mix although most skits are totally distinct form each other, there really aren't any transitions. . But the comedy is great; it's all raunchy comedy and I honestly hadn't heard the jokes before. There's some good audience participation in certain skits and the actors adapted well to their choice of participants. . The acrobatics are also very impressive. I actually preferred a lot of Absinthe's routines to what I've seen at Cirque. Whereas cirque is so abstract and disconnected and you can only see it from afar, Absinthe is right in your face because the theater is so small. You can see the individual muscles bulge on some of the performers as they go about their routine which just makes it all the more impressive. The intimate theater is the ideal setting for such a show. . . Some advice on going. Buy tickets early, but find a discount code online or a discount retailer, there are plenty out there (travelvegas, etc). The earlier you buy a ticket the closer to the front of your section your seats will be. Also, as I said, the intimate setting is incredible so either go for the front row or at least general seating. If you opt for the cheaper tables at the back, you just won't get the full experience.
Incredible funny and entertaining. Full of fabulous tricks and amazing performers. A word to the wise, if you are easily offended stay clear. They don't hold back in the slightest. They make fun of every topic possible. Politics, race, sexuality... They are all addressed and made complete fun of. This is an adult show for sure. Highly sexual and does include some very minimal costumes aka the women are in almost nothing. I came to see this with a friend if mine and completely intend on bringing my husband to see it. Highly recommend.
Excellent!!! 90 mins of laughter. Highly recommend this show...only something you would see in Vegas!
This is just my type of show... raw, raunchy and "dont give a fuck" attitude.... . The gazillionaire and Penny made the show for me. . . Laugh your ass off hilarious... the part when Penny comes out with her sock puppets, Oscar worthy!. . We bought tickets from tix4tonight for $80 instead of the $99 at the box window
Great show, awful venue. It is ok to try to make it cozy, but... the stuck together fold up, no cushion chairs? Not acceptable! Plain old disrespectful to people's money
