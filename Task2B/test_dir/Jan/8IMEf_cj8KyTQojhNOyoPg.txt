We just returned from the Rio. 12/24-12/27/13. Whole family ate at the Carnival Buffet on 12/25. By midnight, I was sick, violently. Just me.. . Was taken out of hotel suite by security, in a wheelchair. Hospitalized for six hours. CT scan. Major narcotic needed to stop intestines from convulsing. . . Food poisoning. Severe dehydration.
This is our 10th time staying at this hotel, our second time for New Year's Eve, we usually stay here for a week during the winter, spring break or summer, because my husband is a platinum member. We have always enjoyed our stay here since my son was born. My son is now 10 and he enjoys the pretzel place and BK Burgers on the second floor. However, this hotel is showing it's age, I never really had a problem with this place, but I am slowly noticing that this place is quickly aging and it is not being kept up well. Each room has a flat screen tv and a refrigerator. There are two room towers, the Masquerade Tower is less crowded with foot traffic and closer to their large parking garage, our favorite. The Impanema Tower is the middle of the casino floor and has more foot traffic. The rooms need to be cleaned better, the towels and linens need to be seriously replaced, the restrooms need to be modernized, and the carnival buffet, well, it is not very good anymore, not worth the price. The food is cold and you can tell that there is no pride in making it. The dessert section is very limited, doesn't offer any good desserts. All their desserts taste like they have been defrosted from the refrigerator and placed on dishes. This place has potential, but it seriously needs some TLC Harrah's Corporation.
A senior security officer told me the hotel is not safe.  So much so, that my son was unable to walk into a snack shop to get help with a bottle top.  He wasn't "accompanied"  and the halls of the hotel are not secure enough for him to walk down the stairs on his own.  He's 13.  He wasn't anywhere near  the casino floor.   He knows to stay away from there.  Just into the snack shop at the bottom of the hotel tower elevator.  About 15 feet from the elevator.    We decided to stay some place safer the next night.  Obviously, there must be a bunch of pedophiles  lurking around because the reaction was extreme. . The restriction for keeping children out of the store isn't posted anywhere.  Clearly it's not a good place for families.  We checked out in the morning and choose a friendlier environment.  Too bad, I guess that's why it's so cheap.  The rooms were ok.  But, don't plan on bringing two wifi devices.  Even after you pay a $22.00 mandatory hotel fee, they charge an extra 13.95/device for wifi access on a second device.  And the in room coffee is $8.00.
I read the reviews after we booked the room through a Southwest Airlines package.  I have to say that my son and I were really pleased with the room.  It was a great place to watch the bowl games with plenty of room, including a small sectional couch.  We were also happy with the meals that we had.  The fitness room was also adequate.  Overall, we are having a nice experience.  We used the shuttle to go to the strip, but I could see it being a but far if you have a need to spend a lot of time on the strip.  My only other time here was for a convention and we had lunch after.  That was also a good experience.  If you want  to drink in your room, I would recommend bringing your own stuff in from the outside.  The alcohol sold here is expensive, but not unlike other resorts.
The Rio is an older Las Vegas casino/hotel, and it shows it's age. Although our room itself, one of the newer Samba Suites was nice, the rest of the Rio was old, dirty, dimly lit, poorly maintained in areas, and smelled like stale cigarettes throughout. . . Our room featured a large living space and bedroom with a floor-to-ceiling view of the strip, which was really cool. The windows were tinted so we could leave the curtains open and enjoy the view during the daytime and nighttime. We also had a large bathroom area with tons of counter space and a shower/tub combo. The TV had a large HDTV, but the TV signal wasn't in HD... The mini-fridge was nice to have, but made a noisy, humming sound. Finally, because we were on the 34th floor, we heard some noise from the nightclub upstairs, but nothing that bad or upsetting. . . Overall I was happy with our room at the Rio, it was sufficient for our needs minus a few things, but the rest of the hotel was lacking. On our next trip to Las Vegas I won't be staying at the Rio. I expected more given the price, even though we did get a good deal.
Online booking made this hotel seem great.  However, things went downhill starting at checking.  They could not provide the room I had requested.  The room provided was an old shabby room with ripped carpet , old ugly wall paper, tiny desk.  I thought I was in a run down holiday inn.  I asked to be moved to the room I requested, front desk said a manager would call back in 10 mins.  Did not  happen.  I will see if I can change hotels tomorrow!. . Update:  I am bumping up to 3 stars.  While a manager never called me back, I went to the front desk and a nice gentlemen moved me to a much improved room.  King size bed, higher floor, nice view.  Just what I had originally asked for.  I will also say housekeeping service was good.  Overall, I would recommend the Rio for a future stay, just be aware this is an older hotel, and some rooms have excessive wear and tear.  On the positive side, rooms are very spacious.  . . It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the strip from the Rio.  Not bad.
I can't speak as a gambler.  But as a hotel I really like the Rio.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  It is off the Strip, but you can walk across the bridge or take the free shuttle to Harrah's (or Bally's), so it's not a big deal to me.. . And the price is usually very reasonable.  Especially given how nice the rooms are.. . And the buffet...the Rio buffet is one of the best.  Huge variety, generally really good food.  But that's a different review!
I remember staying at this hotel in 2001, and back then the rooms where old, the beds where lumpy, the air smelled smokey, and the restaurants where outdated and crappy.. . Fast forward 12 years later, and to my surprise, absolutely NOTHING has changed!. . Except the mattresses now have a good 3 inch dip in the middle of them - great for exasperating your back pain (or trying on back pain for the first time), the cigarette smoke molecules have now given birth to grand children, and the restaurants are an expensive version of your microwave foods / Denny's.. . God I can't wait to leave!. . On the positive note, my view of the city was nice.
Older casino, away from the heart of the strip. Smell of cigarette smoke infused into the main casino floor. Shopping area is very small compared to what you find at Caesar's or Mandalay Bay. Only thing I liked about this casino is KJ Kitchen (dim sum restaurant). With so many other casinos to choose from I would never stay at the Rio.
I'm not sure why the Rio is receiving such low ratings.  I stayed there on the 21st of Dec 2013 for my anniversary and it was amazing.  The staff was great.  The young lady at the front desk named Gina was really great she gave us so much information about the area and things to do other then just giving us a pamphlet and reading off of it. To be honest she was one of the highlights of our trips.  Its always nice when members of staff go out there way.  Our room was greattttttttt it came with a full vanity equipped with vanity mirror and chair to apply your makeup for the night with ease it also had a wet bar in the area and it was super clean.  We went to the buffet there and the food was good.  We also went to Michael Jackson Experience Concert and it was so fun.  So overall from Gina, to the food, Michael Jackson and our huge perfect view room we had a amazing time and whenever I visit Vegas again the Rio will be my choice of hotel.
Only stayed here bc of my convention was here. Would not stay again. Internet slow and unreliable, shower water luke warm with 80s shower head, air not working right and outdated rooms. Also, gave us two queens when we reserved a king. Very uncomfortable especially for the price we paid. However, hotel was beautiful in and of itself with decent restaurants and service. Unpleasant experience, to say the least.
Very dirty room. No entertainment just awful place to be.  KJ Chinese is great though but skip this hotel when you visit vegas
The Rio nickels and dimes you for everything. Bottled water 4.00, seafood buffer 50.00, 24 hour WiFi 14.00, domestic beer 6.00, etc. I would recommend staying elsewhere. There are other nice casino hotels that do not do this to their customers. The Palms for example has 15 buffet. One last note....Caesars properties only have Pepsi products!
We had a 4 day stay at the Rio and it was wonderful! The Penthouse is beautiful, the service was superb! All our needs were quickly taken care of!  Woot woot! We will be back!
This place is kinda gross. Look, I'm not a prude but I don't necessarily want to watch every single cocktail waitress walk around in a thong and I'm kind of sick of go-go dancers in teddys EVERYWHERE in this casino. The clientele are a bunch of creepy older men who stare at the dancers and waitresses while they sip their drinks- and then they try to hit on the women at the bar (my friends and me). Um NO. . There is pretty much nothing redeemable about this place.No good restaurants, no entertaining shopping or shows (other than Penn and Tellar). I've had more fun at the Hooters casino than this place. At least Hooters has chicken wings!
The room was loaded with dust in areas not easy for housekeeping to reach, causing us some respiratory issues at night.  Traffic noise disturbed my wife.  We were charged for an upgraded room without our knowledge.  Furnishings were from 1980.  Casino reeked of cigarette smoke.  Check-in line was 45 minute wait.  Convention area was nice.
All the casinos are pretty much the same to me (well, OK, that's not really true, but I'm not a huge fan of any of the casinos). However, the Rio has Penn & Teller, so they get four stars.
Check in was ridiculously slow , and that was at 8:am in the morning when no one was in line. Our bathroom reeked of urine smell and even after more cleaning they didn't get rid of it. Also the courtesy and attention you get at most of the hotels on the strip is completely lost here. There is a free shuttle to the strip which is nice and the drivers are all cool. But this would be my worst hotel experience in Vegas and I've been here over a hundred room nights.
I would give 2-1/2 stars IF I could, but I can't so I won't... The wife and I take at least one trip to Vegas each year, usually much more often but this one is the first time we've hit the Rio up in at least five years or so. (The only reason we did was this was a last minute trip and there was no room availability at Paris and Planet Hollywood, our first and second choices). I have to say, my oh my how things have changed... Some for the better, some so/so, but unfortunately, more so for the worse.. . The better, as follows:. . For one, the slots seem to be much, much looser than what I remember from before. Not sure if it was just me or what, but we had never had any "reel" luck here, but we did pretty good this past visit. Because it "isn't what it used to be" (re; the bad), the casino for the most part is quite "open" and finding a machine or sitting at a table is not too difficult. It's "off-strip" so that in and of itself lends to a more "intimate" feel. The All American Grill will always serve you up a good steak and or seafood, (particularly rib eye and salmon). The Hotel provides a free shuttle if one has had a few refreshing beverages, wants to hit the strip casinos, (Harrah's properties of course), and avoid walking or cab fees. Works for me!!! All (and I do mean ALL), of the staff we interacted with, from those at the check-in desk, to food and beverage peeps, to folks working in the Sports-book were absolutely fantastic!!! . . The so/so:. . The rooms are nice and large for the most part. And while I've heard that many, many upgrades had been made, ours hadn't. BUT... And this is a big but, It was very clean, unlike other reviews I've read. The bed was very, very comfortable as well, however the TV was older and the picture was not very bright. (We had to close all the curtains during daylight hours to get a good, clear, viewable picture). That said, we don't spend too much time in the room anyways and it's not too big a deal, hence the so/so comment... Parking was fine for us, (unlike some other reviewers mentioned), but we always valet so not sure how applicable that one is. Same scenario with the pools but then how many Las Vegas pools are open in mid-January anyway??? But, our previous experiences with the pool area at the Rio have always been good, again, hence the so/so.. . The Bad:. . $20 Resort Fee... Really? We didn't use the spa, or the gym... Not even the Internet!!! Why not the Internet? Because when I DID try to connect, it freakin' wouldn't let me!!! $20 a day (actually $22.40 w/tax) is just a ripoff. And that is for one device only!!! Absolute bull$hit if you ask me... But here is the kicker (and this is what bothers me most of all)... I remember when the Rio was a fairly happening casino, with lots going on and many decent restaurants to choose from. Our daughters, (when they were young ladies), always loved the "Masquerade in the Sky" show and looked forward to "catching beads" from the performers. All of the available shop space upstairs was utilized and business was, (for lack of a better term), "booming". What we noticed this visit was much of the shop space upstairs and downstairs was now "available", because many restaurants had closed. To me, without the "Masquerade in the Sky" show, the place almost seemed like it had been put out to pasture and it was on its last leg :-(. Too, too, bad. I had always felt that the Rio was still our "fallback" hotel/casino and I'm not sure that is the case any longer.. . The last word:. . While overall, we had a great time, we couldn't help but feel kind of sorry for the Rio and reminisce of the good ol' days, when we were younger, full of energy, life and the Rio Hotel and Casino was too... Bottom line is after staying for years at some of the other Harrah's properties, if we had to "re-stay" at the Rio, would we??? The jury is still out...
Total Rewards: Unethical, bait and switch, double charging.. . Trying to cancel or change the reservation is a nightmare. The communication, on the website, email, and over the phone is vague and dishonest.  It's just bad business.  . . The link in the email to change or cancel doesn't work.  When we called, David (he was from Total Rewards, which is the website used by Rio to make reservations) was relentless in giving us sales pitches, trying to overcharge us.  Spent 1/2 hour on the phone arguing.  . . Finally, he changed the dates at a reasonable rate.  He charged an extra deposit on the card, not taking into account the original deposit.  . . Checked the website and there was no total for the rooms available. We called back to try and cancel the whole thing.  She said there was only the first deposit of $26.66 was charged and no record of the $39.20 that David charged.  Got the cancellation email, but no dollar amount listed that was refunded.. . Now we have to find out from the credit card company to find the $39.20 David charged and fight to get that back.. . Update:  A manager at Caesar's Entertainment was very helpful.  He clarified the information to make clear what had happened and got us a good deal on another property.  The lesson is, contact Ceasar's Entertainment directly and don't deal with Total Rewards.
Had an awful night at the RIO, the noisiest hotel I have stayed in Vegas so far! All the strip facing rooms are smoking so to be punished us non smokers have the back hotel rooms with views of the noisy air conditioning units. Even on the 11th floor there is a constant loud noise all night long.. . To make things worse staff are throwing glass bottles into the trash all night long with the trash men coming at 1am this morning. Other lorries arriving all morning.. . Walls are paper thin so you hear everything. My carpet was also wet with a damp smell but only realised when we arrived at midnight and was too much hassle to move .. . Real pity as this hotel has great sized suites and a free shuttle to the strip. But due to the noise factor I would not recommend staying here. Suggest staying East of the strip at the Westin or Hard Rock which is a similar price if you bid on Priceline.
Not a good experience in Vegas, thanks to the Rio. . . The reason we made reservations at the Rio, is because my boyfriend had a convention at this hotel.. . We rented a car and drove to the hotel).. Right from the start we were disappointed. Unless you want to valet your car, you have to park in the parking garage on the other side of the hotel.  So checking in was a slight nightmare. .  . . Our room was very dated. No complimentary coffee in room (bring your own k cups). We were told the k cups in the minibar are about $18. . . The restaurants are astronomically priced. The Americana buffet was 30+ dollars per person (for so-so food) and the seafood buffet restaurant is about $45 per person. . . .  Normally at a casino, you would hear people yelling and cheering for their wins. The only sounds we hear are the ching-ching of the slot machines. Doesn't sound like much winning here. . . We just tried to valet our car tonight after a night on the strip and was told it was a 30 to 45 minute wait for valet. . . My boyfriend found out that we have to come to this convention yearly (to keep his credentials) and it will be held at the Rio. We don't want to spend anymore money at this hotel or casino so we will stay elsewhere, from now on.
