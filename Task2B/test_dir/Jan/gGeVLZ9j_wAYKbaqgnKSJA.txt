This isn't my kind of scene.  Super loud.  Lots of glitz and glamor.  Bling bling all over the place.  Not my style.. . But I was there for a family birthday party.  This meant tasting menu for everyone.  Last minute they found out I was a pescetariann and made accommodation.  They were super knowledgeable about foods that contained meat and were awfully sweet.  The fish dishes were perfectly cooked.  Loads of flavor.. . Get take out from Tao.  Or go deaf and blind while dining.  (Re-reading my review I feel as if I'm clearly getting old or too mommy-ish).
Fancy place for Asian cuisine and sushi. . . I really liked the sushi. The drinks are good too. They're expensive but met my expectations for a trendy restaurant in Vegas. And we got a stamp to go into the club afterwards where we had a good time. So I enjoyed my experience.
Another walk along memory lane.. I first came here almost 10 years ago, back again now not much has changed.. Service is great, drinks are unique, everything is clean and spacious, I love the decor.. Though if you are trying to have a relaxed night out, this is not the place for you, it gets REALLY noisy.. Prices are Vegas average and the crowd all over the place, great time every time.
I've been back to Tao every time I've been in Vegas (so 3 or 4 more times), and have had excellent food and service every time. I think the key is making a reservation well in advance and expect that you will have to get a drink in the lounge while you wait for your table. (Max wait has been 20-30 minutes, nothing compared to the 1.5 hour wait the first time) It's a great place for groups as you can tell them your preferences and have them just bring out a bunch of items for the table.
Wow!  Great food, great service.  Really enjoyed every bite!  Very sophisticated.
I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner at Tao. The atmosphere was lively and fun. The food was fantastic. . . We started with the lobster wontons in a shiitake ginger broth and the satay of Chilean sea bass that was coated in miso and came with large crisp asparagus. These were both incredible. We ended up ordering a second of the sea bass skewers as they were flaky, moist and sweet. . . For dinner we shared the udon vegetable noodles, the salmon sashimi with avocado and the New York steak with a peppercorn sauce and veggies. Everything was top notch ingredients, and really flavorful. We ended up ordering some sort of crab roll at the end and that was the worst thing we had, otherwise each dish was really wonderful. I'd definitely come here for a fun dinner in Vegas again.
This place is expensive, but absolutely worth it.. . Every time I go to Vegas, I check this restaurant out. A few things I have tried here are the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass, Diver Sea Scallops, and assorted sushi rolls. The Wasabi Crusted Filet is amazing, however, I typically eat fish dishes here now.. . The Peking Duck Spring Rolls are a great appetizer here amongst other things.. . As for drinks, I am not a martini fan in general, but I make an exception at Tao. I will usually have a lychee martini here, and it is expensive like everything, but again reallllllllllly tasty. I have also tried the Tao-tini and one other drink, and they were both tasty as well.. . For dessert, Molten Chocolate Cake. Let me repeat that... Molten. Chocolate. Cake. Worth every last calorie consumed. Save room for dessert, which will be hard, but trust me on this one.. . I have always received outstanding service here, and excellent food.
This is the second time my wife and I have been to the Tao Asian Bistro, the first time being 5 years ago. It was just as we remembered! We were greated warmly, and arriving at 5:30 on a Friday evening we were seated promptly. Our waiter took great care in making sure we understood the menu. My wife ordered the tempura eggplant and the mandarin fried rice with pork and I ordered the chilean sea bass. Both of our entrees arrived warm and presented well. I sampled my wife's fried rice and I can honestly say it was the best I have had. And the chilean sea bass was just as I remembered it...out of this world! We topped it off with the giant fortune cookie...holy smokes was it good! For the two of us it was under $100 and well worth it!
Words cannot begin to describe how great this restaurants was. Ask the server to create your table a custom menu to share family-style. Don't leave without trying the spicy tuna tartare, lobster spring rolls, glaze swordfish, wok seared NY sirloin with mushrooms and potatoes.   If you're tight on budget stick to the tuna tartare, the swordfish, and a side. Hands-down top-five meal I've had anywhere!
