If you are gluten free I highly recommend visiting this place . The gluten free pizza is garlicky,  spicy goodness on a fresh baked real pizza crust.  Its to die for. The service however leaves something to be desired. They didn't have enough wait staff and one person waiting on 10+ tables was inhumane.
My go-to place for a great fired pizza...everything here is delicious and great ambiance in historical downtown.  Great place to sit outside and enjoy lunch in our awesome weather as well (note that lunch has a slightly different menu and includes sandwiches).  Favorites include the Omero salad, Prosciutto Crudo and Diavola pizzas, and the Fresca for dessert.  Recommended over Pizzeria Bianco.  I wish I could more stars for this place...
Great little place for small groups of people. The parking was hard to get, but by the time we got in and ordered; it was worth it. We grabbed a seat at the bar because it was quite busy.. Food tasted pretty good and filled us right up.. . The atmosphere was nice after getting outside to hangout for a bit. There was live jazz music playing and a warm fire to sit near.
This rating is based on an average from two different visits. During one visit, I went for dinner and had the most delicious pizza! The charm of this place makes you feel like you are distant from reality. The dessert wine I ordered at the end was the icing on the cake! . . However, on my next visit, I sat outside on the patio for brunch and it was not quite as great of an experience. The weather was great, but the sun was shining pretty bright so I am guessing that is why our server only came by to get our order, drop it off, and bring our tab. No refills, no feedback requested on the meal, nothing. She was a very sweet lady, she just didn't seem to want to serve our table. The food was just ok. Nothing exciting. And probably more disappointing since I had already been there once and had such an awesome experience. . . Overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I recommend the pizza, but I guess it is kind of hit or miss.
I really enjoy coming here on date nights but anytime there is a wait I feel very awkward as there is no place to wait without totally being in the way.  The food is always incredible and I love the Bruschetta.  I enjoy the Sunday Brunch days with the live music as well.
Very good for lunch. Friendly, great service, pizza is super tasty, salads look amazing.
I wish there was one in LA!! I went to AZ to visit a friend and I fell in love with this place! I kept on wanting to go back everyday but my friend was being a cheapie because it's not the cleverest thing to eat out all the time. Regardless, I really enjoyed my time there. The staff was great. I loved my dishes and especially the burrata appetizer. It was amazing. I got a pizza and added prosciutto.  Excellent in everything. We finished with a shot of lemoncello (I don't know how to spell it) but its vodka infused with lemon and it was amazing but hella strong. I want a Cibo in LA!
I honestly feel that two stars is too generous of a rating for our experience tonight; however, the lone redeeming factor was my husband's gluten-free pizza - which was quite tasty.. . I have been to Cibo several times (probably 5 or 6 over the past several years) and have always loved the pizza. Tonight though was a different story.  While the pizza was delivered rapidly; my pizza was soggy. After waiting 10-15 minutes to flag down the waitress I told her that I was unhappy with the crust. She went into a wordy explanation that this was secondary to the amount of toppings on the pizza. OK... Sure... I'll have a margherita pizza. New pizza comes out in literally 3 minutes w/ the crust WET. Definitely more soggy than the first pizza. Not even remotely cooked / chewy. Absolutely disgusting. . . Again wait for waitress -- now she says this is "just how our pizzas are."  Really? You guys are in the business of serving soggy / wet pizza? Since when? I've never had issues like that before.  . . Left without eating. (+) one star for previous positive experiences at Cibo and my hubby's decent GF pizza.  Overall though the food / service tonight was an epic fail.
I love this place. after I had their pizza I can no longer enjoy pizza hut,  dominoes etc anymore. Also I've never tried Bianco pizzeria and that's beacuse that's always a 2 hour wait. I give 5 stars cause the sevice is awesome, food comes out quick. And thebill is like 50 bucks for two. Cibo is definetly.  winning.
Wonderful outdoor patio atmosphere. Good appetizers and wine selection. Nice, quiet, romantic evening dinner location.
Great patio and nice beer selection. The pizzas are small but delicious. I could probably eat 2 by myself if I was really hungry.
I lived in Naples Italy, this takes me right back there!! Awesome, I had the Margherita Pizza, first bite brought back memories.
Yummy. Good for lunch for the downtown crowd. It's nice to have something that's not in the business district.
The best restaurant in phoenix, hands down. If you don't get the pulled beef sandwich for lunch you are missing out on life. Oh and the crepes are too die for. Great service, nice people and darling restaurant.
good pizza in a cute bungalow with a lovely outdoor garden seating!
Liked the pizza, loved the atmosphere.
This place is adorable, the staff give great service and the food is delicious. What's not to love!?
Slow service and this place charges for soda refills!!!  Pizza is ok, but NO FREE DRINK REFILLS!!!!  There's better.
Delicious!  Delicious!  Delicious!  Their pizza is better than Pizzeria Bianco, in my opinion and their nutella crepes are to die for!
So, I ate here the night of the Pickwick show and then again a week later, and I can confidently say I'm a huge fan!. . My dining companion and I sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant.  Our server, Tom, was great! Attentive but not hovering, funny, and accommodating.  . . I ordered a glass (or two) of the Pillsbury Wild Child, which is one of my faves!  We started with the grilled veggie plate (lots of tasty grilled/chilled veggies lightly drizzled with olive oil and a side of bread), then we ordered a mushroom pizza on the gluten-free crust.  We asked Tom if we could sub goat cheese for the cow stuff and he totally made it happen.  What a guy!  It was effing delicious, I couldn't even tell the crust was sans gluten.  . . The look of the place and adorable, very cozy and cute.  Good location and really nice for a date:) I'm sure most of you have already enjoyed Cibo, but if you haven't....well, get yourself together and head down!
Love the ambiance . Quaint Urban setting in an old downtown home. Live music, patio dining as well as indoors.   Beer and Wine bar.
I've been here three times. I would say this place has the best atmosphere for early Friday evening. The best seats are outside during the springtime and if you could get the inside, it would also give the great view of the Phoenix downtown. The pizza here is made hand tossed and thin crust. Some of you may know that there is competitor near this pizza restaurant. Honestly I would choose this place over Pizzeria B.... because of the wait time there. . . In addition to Pizza, this restaurant offers variety of wine selections and locally brewed beer. If you were not driving, I would highly recommend some of the wine; it matches well with pizza! Also, the crepe here is amazing mainly because of the fresh cheese that they use to make it. IF you are fan of live music, they play sweet guitar/key board smooth jazz on Friday night at outside patio. Check this place out and let me know if you visit!
