Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me twice (and make me barf)? . . So I decided to give this place another chance back on my friend's birthday. The food ranged from really good (the bacon--wrapped figs) to meh. The service was as snooty as I remembered it. But the 1-star (I'd give it zero if I could) is for the FOOD POISONING I got from this dump that had me hurling for two days straight. This was about a month or so before Salmonella-Gate last year, which certainly explains a lot. . . I will never understand the amount of hype and praise this restaurant gets from foodies in this town.
Amazing food at inexpensive prices.
