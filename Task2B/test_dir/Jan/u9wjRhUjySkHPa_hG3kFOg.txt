We had the chance to stay here at a discounted rate through the Rock 'n' Roll race series, and I jumped on it. . . The Wynn is a gorgeous luxury hotel. It was pretty much everything you'd expect for the price point. Our room was beautiful, the bathroom was a spa-like oasis, and the lobby was one of the classier environs in Vegas. We ate dinner in the hotel one night at La Cave and the meal was wonderful; I have no doubt the other restaurants are also excellent. To enumerate the many, many positives of this hotel would be repetitive of the other reviews.. . A few things I'd fix: Housekeeping came early every day (before 11, possibly earlier) and left a sign on our door that they couldn't clean due to our Do Not Disturb sign. We had to call and request the room cleaned every day, and typically it gone done quite late after that. I think it would make sense to make the default cleaning time a little later, especially in a city like Vegas known for late night hijinks.. . Despite its beauty, I'm not sure the Wynn casino is a good fit for my tastes. I'm not much of a gambler, and if I do play, I'm probably not betting much money. The Wynn caters to a high rolling crowd. As a result, I found myself going to other, more moderately priced casinos for entertainment. Ditto the shopping; it was fun to window shop at Alexander McQueen and Prada, but I'm not the type of person who's going to actually buy anything there.. . I highly recommend the Wynn to you, classy traveler. You will love it. For me, I  might select something a bit less high-brow on my next Vegas jaunt.
Really nice hotel. The gaming floor is really beautiful.  The one take away I had from my experience was the ventilation was kind of poor. I stunk really bad of cigarettes when I left and I didn't really see that many smokers. Sooner or later Vegas will lose gamblers like me to smoke free places.
I gotta give Steve Wynn his props.  Golden Nugget, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore.  He built each of those properties, and each of them raised the bar in Vegas.  . . The Wynn is a very nice, easy place to stay in Vegas.  The accommodations and service are top notch, and it's a beautiful, easy to navigate property.  . . Although the Wynn is a thoroughly modern Vegas hotel, it retains a lot of old Vegas feel to it in terms of scale and service.  Genuinely great service used to be a given in Vegas almost anywhere you went, but it's become increasingly rare.  I miss the old Vegas a lot, and the Wynn reminds me of the old Vegas even if it doesn't really look like the old Vegas.  . . Parking is a breeze unlike many Vegas properties.  The parking structure is easy to get in and out of and easy to park i, and the walk from the parking structure to the casino is basically nothing.  . . If it's high end shopping, dinning, or nightlife you're after, Mr. Wynn's got you covered.  Tryst is one the best nightclubs in Vegas and probably my favorite.  . . One small gripe:  Once in the casino, you have to traverse the entire casino floor to get to the check in desk and then all the way back again to get to the elevators to the rooms.  This kind of set up is endemic to the species, though, so it's hard to give Mr. Wynn too much grief about that.  Once you ARE checked in, though, the room elevators ARE close to where you enter the casino from the parking structure.  . . On our way out with our bags, the folks checking room keys at the elevators thanked us for coming and bid us safe travels.  It was a nice touch and seemed genuine.  . . I doubt anyone who stays at the Wynn would be disappointed.. . Bonus:  Tacos El Gordo is a short walk up the boulevard away.  The spicy pork tacos there are spectacular and worth the short walk up the boulevard to an admittedly somewhat rough around the edges shopping center in the shadow of Encore to get them.  The vast majority of the denizens of the Wynn won't make that walk and will never know what they are missing.
Remember in Happy Gilmore how he had to go to his "happy place"?? The Wynn is mine, without question.  I love everything about this hotel, especially the fact that they're always playing Kaskade when I arrive - always!. . I've stayed here about 4 times and the service is nothing less than stellar.  The rooms are nice and modern without being completely computer programmed (sorry Aria), and the beds are heavenly!  The whole theme of the place is like a grown up wonderland which is right up my alley, and the entrance is just so pretty! . . The best thing about staying here is you never have to leave.  There are tons of great restaurants and clubs within Wynn/Encore, and the Encore casino is my favorite for blackjack.  Make sure to hit up Botero for an amazing dinner and Encore Beach Club for the ultimate Vegas pool party experience.
A very anti-kid hotel.  Bed rails?  No, they were out.  Fridge for milk?  No, that's an extra charge.  The main part of the hotel (before guest rooms) reeks of cigarette smoke.  There is one small store that sells milk for a crazy price ($4 for a glass of milk that is not even organic).. . Our suite was huge and beautiful.  The bathroom tub could have been bigger.  While I am very grateful that I have been able to stay at many swanky hotels, I just didn't love this one as much as the others.  It didn't have that extra pizazz, warmth or extraordinary level of service.  . . Please note that all fish served at the Wynn is farm raised (according to one of the chefs).
My husband i went to las vegas for last mins trip during xmas holidays.. Luckily, I found food and beverage credits promotion of wynn hotel when I searched travel package.. . We stayed bellagio, mirage, aria and wynn..so far. To compared, I loved wynn hotel with upgraded room. . It was so worth to pay extra money to enjoy view days and night.. Also, we can save money to use food and beverage credits which was $150. Really enjoyed trip this time.
Very luxurious hotel. The lobby garden with flower decorated pathway is a breathtaking moment. Every angle you pose at, it's a picture perfect design. Great clubs reside here. Every design and decoration is beautiful. It's a must visit.
Five star and first class service! Went to see Garth Brooks with his band and was offered a package deal which included accommodations to the tower suites!     . . Excellent show, fantastic service from the valet, front desk to the most beautiful salon suite upgrade. World class service, complimentary breakfast at Tableau, which was excellent to the most immaculate and beautiful hotel experience. Casino was fun, no luck but who cares, we had soo much fun. Great wine bar, LaCave, nice sports book and loved Parasol Up Bar for a nice cocktail. Excellent!!! Can't wait to go back!
Total sausagefest last night lol Which, if I wasn't a girl, I would probably be disappointed, but me & my girl-friend liked not having to deal with girls staring down girls all night haha Classy-dressed people in one big space. Drinks are expensive, but duh, that's the strip. Three drinks for around $60 or so? Not sure, we were pretty drunk. Maybe because it was belvedere, Malibu rum, and Jameson. Hm. Haha oh and!, I also was betting $2 on Keno and I won $3200! Good fun winning money, being dressed up with other pretty people, and shouting at fellow neighbors or walk-byers.
Check in clerk was amazing.  Dining options were amazing. Casino staff were helpful.  Our room was nothing liked I'd ever experienced before...remote controlled curtains, huge tub, the list goes on. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I also want to say La Reve was the best show I have seen so far in Vegas.
nice rooms,card dealer don't usually smile here,buffet is a great place here!
AUTOMATIC SHADES. . When I found out our work group was staying here I was so happy. My room was amazing and the view was breathtaking. But what brought me the most joy was laying in bed and opening and closing the automatic shades and curtains. Honestly I could lay there all day and have a blast. I guess it's the little things that make me happy. In all of my world travels that is one feature I have never really seen in a hotel. . . Steve Wynn spares no expense and everything is top notch in any of his properties. He understands his customers are willing to pay for the good life. Steve provides that good life here. He plays videos on the in-room TV where he describes the hotel. After 4 days of non-stop talking in the dry weather my voice starts to sound like Steve Wynn. I crack up all my co-workers with doing hilarious versions of Steve's TV speeches. I love Vegas for laughs with co-workers. . . This hotel is amazing but expensive too. The room is great. It is so luxurious I want to stay here all of the time. The bathroom is huge too. I enjoy the amazing views of the mountains and it's such a great sight to see when I wake up. . . The hotel has some restaurants inside. There is one we always go too but that's because you can get a bag of hot donuts after dinner. Those things are so good. There's also a nightclub but I've never been to it. Work seems to always get in the way of business trips. Damn work. . . I do use the gym/spa though. It is a little expensive at $20 a day but I need to get my workout in. I will work in breakfast there too with some fresh fruit and a coffee. So it kind of works out because it might actually cost me $20 to just order that food for breakfast. My mornings are not complete until I've gotten my six mile run in.  So as unhealthy as Vegas can be between the amount of food and late nights this gym puts me right back on my healthy track. Which is derailed by the end of every evening...ha!!!. . So if you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas then this is the place to stay. It will make you feel like a king. I wish I could spend more time hanging here then actually working off-site. They use to have a free shuttle through the golf course to the convention center. That was the best but it's now gone. It made my work day so easy. Now I have to take the scary convention bus in traffic or a taxi to get to the show. Steve if your listening bring the bus back!!!
I went to the theater at the Wynn for a WWE Event during CES, so my experience only extends to the floor and not the rooms.. . Still, the Wynn sets out to impress. The entrance is decked out with a glamorous garden, and the theater itself accommodated a few hundred people and a number of large screens. It made for a great event, one worthy of Vince McMahon and John Cena.
This hotel exemplifies the new Las Vegas. No more theme hotels for me unless I bring the kids. This, my friend, is a hotel for adults.. I recently stayed in the tower suites. Living room, bedroom, huge bathroom and a terrific view. It was nice sitting back at night drinking a glass of wine and watching the vegas night. . . Great staff with plenty to do in and around the hotel property.. Looking forward to returning.
I just checked in for a work function.  Despite having a confirmed reservation at the Wynn, I was given a room at the Encore.  Under the same roof?  It's a completely different hotel.  6 acres later, I'm checked in and pissed!  I really dislike Vegas to the core.  I was excited to stay at the Wynn.  Front desk person was respectfully bitchy.  Terribly disappointed with the bait and switch.
I find myself booking at the Wynn time after time, after time, after time, after time. It is simply perfect in every way. The rooms are in great condition, the service is fast and efficient, andthey have the best buffet in Vegas. The restaurants and clubs at the Wynn and Encore are second to none, and they're easily accessible if you're a hotel guest.
love  it.. just  fantastic
One of my favorite Casino in the strip, this isn't as crowded as the other one.  The most important this one felt more classy and isn't smelly at all. Their interior design is heavy based butterfly, There's staff everywhere and had very helpful provided assist.  The time were were there also were offering $10 free-play slot.  They got many different kind of slot, included some heavy license one like Iron Man 3 and Avatar, never know there's a slot for that.. . Everywhere in the Casino was clean and felt comfortable playing here, as with most casino.  They bring free drinks while you are playing here.  This one actually offer you alcohol drinks unlike most other just gave you water or juice.  I would definite come back to stay here and try their famous Buffet.  You can walk to Encore inside without stepping out the sun.  Their play club booth was near the entrance, unlike other casino is hidden some where in the casino floor.
This hotel is VERY over rated!!!. Very poor customer service.  This hotel will nickel and dime you to death!. There is a charge for everything!. Upon arrival, front desk asks for $150 per day hidden charge of "convenience fee".  I booked a 2 night stay and paid for all up-front, including resort fees as I arrived on a Thursday and did not get paid until Friday.  I paid for my entire stay of $850 up front and the front desk would not let us check in our room (even though it was paid in full in advance) until we could pay for the "convenience fee" of $300.  This is like a loan of my money to the hotel!  And the hotel will not reimburse you back your money until 2 days after your stay!. There was a $25 charge to use the fridgerator in the room (just wanted to make a bottle of water cold) this will cost the $25 fee!. The towels were so badly bleached that they literally stood up on there own and reeked of bleach!. We were on a non-smoking floor and someone was smoking in there room as the hall way was so badly filled with smoke that your eyes hurt and your throat was soar the next day.. We were offered free Wifi and they make you pay for it up front and then get reimbursed upon check out; had to accept the 13.95 fee on your cell phone to get any reception.. Part of my reservation had a special that included 2 buffet tickets per day and it is not explained that the buffet was only for Breakfast and Lunch and not Dinner.. I will never stay here again!. Nor will I recommend this hotel to my friends!. Clearly a case of "bait and switch".
So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.. . Don't get me wrong I'm a fan and had a great time.  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.. . And I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!
You can read all the good things about this place in other reviews; I'm just writing this to tell you some things I didn't like, in case you also dislike them. . . First was check in: The line was 20 minutes long and moved sooooo slooooowly. Then the person handling my registration made a rookie mistake and looked up someone else's reservation, making me stand there and make a bunch of changes, and didn't figure it out till I had wasted a good 10 minutes with her. Sorting it all out took another 10. They get an F here.. . The ground floor layout, including the casino and lobby areas, is purposely confusing, designed to make you wander around lost. It took me 2 days to learn how to get where I needed to go. . . The room was nice, with a large window looking down on the city and at the mountains. But I could not adjust the temperature, so it was always too warm in there. The thermostat gave you the illusion you could cool it down to 65, but it never actually went down. Booo. . . The bed was large and comfy, except that there was only a heavy quilt, no sheet, so I woke up in a sweat all night long. (See previous comment about the temperature.). . Using the TV to check out took too long. And despite entering my email address, I never got a receipt. Oh, and if you make a toll free call from the room phone, thinking it's free, guess again. $1.50 each call. Annoying.. . So now you know what to expect.
Horrible customer service.  I had a bunch of baloney mini-bar charges to my room.  When I called to inquire about them, I got the run-a-round.
After writing my pretty hateful review for Bellagio, I realized I haven't shown love for my absolute favorite place in Vegas - Wynn/Encore.  Wynn and Encore resort staff are the embodiment of hospitality.  I've never encountered an employee who wasn't professional, kind, helpful, and sincere.  Most of all, they seem happy to work there, and it makes a big difference in a guest's experience.. . We've stayed at Wynn and Encore in everything from a standard King room to a Salon Suite. Every room has been clean, beautiful, andstylish.  In-room dining is delicious and quick, and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The casino allows smoking, but you'd barely know it.  The air is well-filtered, and unless you're sitting right next to a smoker, it's very breathable.  The shopping is first class, and there are plenty of awesome dining and drinking stops throughout the building.  (Okada/Mizumi - yummm).  In the summer, the pools are a little crowded, but awesome.  Great music, clean facilities, and helpful waitresses.  . . I can't praise this resort enough - I'd give it 1,000 stars.  It's my happy place.
I happen to be a big fan of The Wynn. I have stayed in the rooms on a number of occasions over the years as well as dined at many of the restaurants, enjoyed shows and visited all of the clubs and I have to say I have only good things to say about the property. . . The parking is great, no matter how busy I always seem to find a good spot. The layout is convenient and despite the grand size of the property it is quite easy to navigate your way around. Every restaurant I have tried has been impressive. The shows are always quality and entertaining. The rooms are really nice comfortable and the clubs are some of my favorites in town.. . The Wynn has everything going for it so I can't find a single reason not to give the place 5 stars.
