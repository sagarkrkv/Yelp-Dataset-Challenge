Este restauranteesta fuera de Las Vegas Strip, a unos 20 minutos caminando.  Pueden tomar el monoriel y parar en la ultima estacion del Norte y ahi se puede tomar un taxi.  La plaza donde esta situado se ve abandonada, pero vale la pena visitar.. . Muy buen restaurante, les recomiendo la sopa de coco y el sea bass con noodles.  Espero regresar pronto!
Ate here on 12/25/13. Got there a half hour before they opened. The mall they are in is pretty run down, but there is plenty of free parking. Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from eating here. The restaurant inside is much bigger and better than the outside would suggest. We were going to leave, but a line quickly formed before they opened so we figured we should stay. This is the best Thai food I have eaten in the US. Service was excellent, food came out quickly, and best of all, the food was excellent. They also have a huge wine selection if you drink wine. Ate the Drunken Noodles with soft shell crab, Massaman curry, crab fried rice, Tom Yum soup. The curry was sweeter than I've had before but was quite good. Highly recommended. Honestly, not sure what the difference would be between a 4 and a 5 star rating. I can't imagine a Thai restaurant being better than this. Maybe I should give it 5 stars.
Worst Thai food and very rude staff.. . This place blows after wait of 40 min just to be seated my expectations were very high. However, the servers are rude and take for ever to even bring out food and the price of the food does not meet the quality of the food... High prices for nasty take out food. Don't waist your time or your money. Their are several places do eat out rather than this place.
Pros: super friendly staff, great quality food, fresh ingredients, efficient busboys. . Cons: small waiting area, super small portions, way overpriced . . Tip: call way ahead for reservations (even like a day or two before) or else be prepared to wait... We went on a Thursday evening like 6:30ish, an hour after opening, only waited 30 mins... Can only imagine if we showed up later!
I remember visiting my grandma and eating delicious Thai food. I also remember her house had various Buddhas, Thai figurines, elephants, and a picture of the Thai king and queen adorning her home. Going to Lotus of Siam is like going back to my grandmas house except they charge me and I have to share this place with other people. It's in a sketchy strip mall, it's insanely busy ALL the time, but I'd brave it all to come and eat here. The food is authentic (seriously my grandma would cook this stuff, I didn't know that Pad Thai was "Thai" food until much later in life) and I can't imagine a place that does some of these staples anywhere else. If you come for lunch you have the option of doing the buffet. DO NOT DO THE BUFFET. You may as well just hit up Buffet Asia. Don't go to any restaurant that has a James Beard Award and even think about the buffet. . I've been here so many times that I can't list all the dishes I've had. NONE of them disappoint. If you're nervous or unfamiliar with Thai food ask your server for some recommendations. If you're familiar with Thai food, but not so familiar with Northern Thai food order a few familiar items and get at least ONE thing you've never had before. There's a reason it's busy,there's a reason it's won awards, there's a reason I feel a real sense of nostalgia for grandma's house when I'm here, and there's a reason my mom (also from Thailand) has trouble eating Thai anywhere else. This place is good because they showcase authentic Thai cuisine and they try to honor the culture via taste buds. If you want to go, but hate waiting (I feel you man) visit at lunch when they first open and make a reservation.
On my last night in Vegas, I figured I'd hit the strip for some tried and true authentic Thai cuisine at none other than the famous Lotus of Siam. Located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip, you'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake, this place is the real deal folks! At check in, we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait. We were then invited to the bar to pass the time.  Needless to say, we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals.  Before we knew it, our table was ready! Way less than 45 minutes I might add.. . Our server was kind courteous and very helpful. She took our orders and within moments, our tasty dishes were basking on our table.. . Sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!. . Crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!. . Garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!. . Overall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy . . Happy Eats!
This is the best Thai restaurant this side of the Pacific Ocean.  It is hard to find.  Highly suggest you take a cab!!  Order the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles.  They do Duck to perfection!!  Love, love love this place!!!
Solid Thai restaurant but totally overrated by the press.  There are other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas for the same price that are just as good.  You will definitely need a reservation for this place.  . . I've beenhere about 3 times now.  All the noodle dishes are excellent.  Soups are just ok -- nothing to write home about.  They have a huge menu, so there are definitely a lot of dishes that I haven't tried yet.
~$12 per person for the lunch buffet. This place is a little off the strip, and it is definitely worth it. The place does not face the main street, so you have to turn into a parking lot before you will see it. It is not the best Thai food, but it is a great deal for a good variety of food. The Thai tea was great. This is a place to go if you have been to the strip previously and want a cheap, filling meal.
I came here on a Saturday night in Vegas. When I came in through the front door there were about 11 seats in the waiting area which were all full of customers waiting already. I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. . . I ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. . . Next I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. . . The Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK. . . If you came here on a busy night and had to wait longer than 30 minutes I would recommend not coming here considering the price. If you do decide to wait it out DON'T order the Nam Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, and Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.. . Overall the service was good, the items I ordered were pretty bad with the exception of the Musamam curry, and I would probably not come here again.
Came here Friday 1/4/13  @ 6PM because of the reviews and before a show at the Wynn. Almost missed the location from the Sahara and thought it was a mom and pop, 10 table HITW. Walked in on a tiny waiting area for a surprisingly large restaurant. Hostess said it would be a 2 hour wait (for 2), OUCH! Packed with diners and food coming through looked good so helped ourselves to the bar area where we could see many enjoying themselves. Really bustling and waiters earning their tips. Ordered a SINGHA pint and enjoyed conversation and reviewing menu with my lady. Met a great couple from Houston who also came bc of Yelp and made the wait short. Actually, wait was only about  45 minutes and they were ready to take our order + another round. Ordered pork satay, seafood pad thai, spicy catfish and fried bananas.All delivered to our table diligently and well presented. Was all very tasty but will definitely order off the beaten path next time around. when in Vegas.
First thoughts: Vegas sometimes feels like the city of AYCE, so why not Thai food too?.  . The menu at Lotus of Siam is extensive with the menu split into regional cuisine. (Northern, Southern, etc.) My bf and I had decided early on that we would eat at the lunch buffet instead so we arrived at around 11:45 am and the restaurant was already pretty packed. Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm..  . For $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables..  . For me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! . . The service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled..  . Bottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food. If I return, I will probably order off the menu next time to compare with the AYCE food.
Get the crispy duck. The crispy duck with basil/mint is the best of the crispy duck options.
We were recommended to this place by a couple the next before.  The restaurant opens at 5.30pm for dinner.  We got to the restaurant at around 5pm and there was already a line outside.  . . We ordered the stuffed chicken wings for appetizer,  chicken larb for salad, and drunken noodles with soft crab shell and dry pork curry noodles for entrees.  One word - Delicious! Delicious! Okay, I lied, 2 words.  Now I understood why the wait to get in.  . . The place is clean and spacious, and the servers were really friendly.
The punchline unfortunately has to be "shockingly disappointing food".. . We walked in without reservation and had a short wait of 25 minutes.. . We began with Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice). The dish was not to my taste, as the sourness of the lime was too overpowering.. . Next we had the Tom Kah Kai. This mushroom soup with a coconut milk based broth proved inedible despite our best efforts and was unquestionably the lowlight.. . We ordered drunken noodles with soft shell crab as our first entree. The noodles were passable but soggy, the crab meat was chewy.. . Our final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless. It also had an unusual but pleasant sweetness.. . Though the food was a disappointment, staff was prompt, friendly, and attentive with wait staff checking in frequently (though not too often).. . The price was also very reasonable for Las Vegas.. . Overall, I would recommend dining elsewhere.
So I decided to brave Lotus of Siam again, and admit that it's winning me over.. . The crispy garlic prawns were a step down though; not very garlicky at all and I think the batter wasn't fully cooked.. . You can totally eat the shells, but I'd still stay away from the tails, which have a tendency to poke you in your mouth. Ouch!. . The nam prik ong was pretty fucking awesome. No wonder why it was featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." The cool veggies (carrots, cauliflower, cucumber, string beans) offset the heat of in the spicy pork dip (my medium was plenty spicy).. . But nothing is better than dipping pork rinds in pork. I mean, it's all the same animal, so it's meant to be.. . My Thai friend Amy ordered an incredible crispy duck dish during our previous visit, and I was trying my damndest to remember the name. Oh well, next time.. . The parking lot still sketches me out though. There were a few ambulances there when I went ... God knows what ... or who ... went down at the neighboring brothel and bathhouse.
I've been visiting Las Vegas for nearly a decade now, and I started to hear rave reviews for Lotus of Siam on my second or third trip.  I love Thai food, but didn't get a chance to dine here until we had a car to drive off-Strip to the back of a sketchy strip mall.  I wasn't put off by the location (I love a good dive), but it didn't seem like somewhere I really wanted to catch a cab.. . We visited at lunchtime, tired and hungry from early-morning flights, and decided to hit the buffet.  I think this was our critical error.  The majority of the 5-star reviews here are for their menu service, not the buffet.  But we were starving and the limited options on the buffet seemed like a reasonable trade-off for instant gratification.  I wish we'd looked at the buffet before agreeing to be seated in the dining area around it - one glance and I think we would've opted for the menu dining room instead.. . It was a small buffet and very little on it was Thai cuisine.  Mostly, it offered the typical Pan-Asian dishes you find on cheap buffets - rice, lots of stir-fried veggies and meats, some noodles, some broth-y soups, sliced fruit, crispy fried appetizer things, etc.  The Pad Thai and a veggie dish were the only recognizably "Thai" dishes out there, the rest were pretty uninteresting.  Nothing seemed particularly well-made or seasoned, either.  The highlight of the buffet was the fried banana wontons.  We ate so many of those once we discovered how mediocre everything else was.  . . I'm sad to give Lotus of Siam a 2-star review, but the buffet doesn't deserve anything higher even if you're dining in a room literally lined in photos of the celebrity guests who have dined there (and a gigantic glassed-in wine cellar, which was incongruous with the buffet).  I'd be interested to return for a real menu dining experience.  I don't often give second chances to places that let me down this badly, but I know I must be missing something here.
Being a Concierge for over 14 years, I can count how many times they answer the phone. They are not courteous and friendly. They can only hold the reservation for 5 mins. The restaurant is very tiny. Its fire hazardous. Since they are very popular, they should extend their restaurant and have some kind of reservation agent for booking. This is such a task for us in the industry as well as for our guests.
First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :). . Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing. . . You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks. . . Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices... . . Just go here, that is all.
The 45mins wait for crispy duck on panang curry was well worth it. Must try! A reservation is highly recommended.
This place is over hyped.  Every dish we ordered had barely anything on the plate. Lotus of siam, you disappoint me.
very good thai food for the vegas area.  been here twice, and will come back again when visiting.
Absolutely delicious from start to end.  Drunken noodles are the bomb. Garlic noodles too.  In fact, everything was terrific. The fried banana and coconut ice cream were the perfect end to a great meal.
If I could give more stars, I would.  This place is absolutely amazing.  Wait was 45 minutes, which wasn't bad; but with 2 kids they were pretty frantic when we were seated.  Our gracious waiter rushed our appetizer order so the kids could eat.  Also, it was our first time trying Thai food and our waiter made great recommendations.  Can't wait to go back.
Such a great find!  The location is a strip mall and at night empty, except this place. We ordered the garlic prawns and a soup. The food was delicious and service was great. I would suggest the garlic prawns as a must have.
Some of the best Thai food I've ever eaten!  Don't let the bad location turn you away...this place is a hidden gem!
Excellent food! Excellent service! Drunken noodles are the best. I've been to Thailand and this was just as good or better!
Just went to Thailand for 2 weeks in October. Haven't be able to find authentic Thai food in the states until last night. Felt like we were back in Chiang Mai. . . Green curry level 10 was perfect. Tom Yum was incredible. Drunken noodles / soft shell crab is a must.
The location is in a funny side of town, but the food out beats it; their 12:00pm to 2 . :00pm all you can eat lunch buffet is quite the catch.
My sister, her husband, and I ate at Lotus of Siam on 1-7-2014 (for the first time) and found the food we ordered to be excellent.  I had the spicy shrimp soup and spicy chicken wings (an 8 in hotness) as an appetizer, and they were excellent.  The Lemon Grass soup with chicken her husband shared with us was excellent.  My sister ordered the Yellow Curry and was excellent (I thought is was surprisingly mild) which we all ate portions of.  We craved more chicken wings and ordered another serving of even hotter (10 this time) and were just right. My only complaint was the servers could have removed finished dishes sooner and had to be asked to do so. My sister and her husband have lived in Las Vegas over 35 years and said this was the first time that they had been by Lotus of Siam where there was not a line waiting to get in, as they had wanted to eat here before, but had not wanted to wait in line to get in.  I would say this place would set the standard for all Thai restaurants to aspire to.
This place is more like 1.5...slow service .....small portions..expensive...eh taste...whats not to like...haha...what blows me away is the throngs of people who come here and actually wait online outside before they open....and whats with those weird ass hours...This place reminds me of langers neighborhood in los angeles...better come with a shotgun to ward off the baseheads and 5 dollar hookers as you pull into the shopping center.....but if you want to go to a swingers club or a tranny bar your in luck there across the parking lot ...woo hoo !
The food was amazing, but there were some major trade-offs:. . 1. Our 45-60 minute wait lasted about 80 minutes. We had enough time to go back to our room, change, come back to the restaurant, and still wait long enough to be pretty hungry by the time we were seated. . . 2. I got food poisoning. While we shared all of our dishes, one of them had individual soft shell crabs, which was the majority of what I puked out later in the evening. I've since read about other food poisoning reports here, particularly connected to seafood, so I think there must be a problem. It left me sick for a full 24 hours, and worse, my immune system was so down from the dehydration and the dry winter weather in Vegas, this was followed by a cold that lasted several more days. . . As terrible as my illness was, I had a very tasty dinner before the aftermath, which makes it hard to write Lotus off completely:. . Red curry - amazing. Fried spicy catfish - solid. Drunken noodle soft shell crab - good noodles, bad crabs. Fried banana w/coconut ice cream and sticky rice - good but a bit too sweet. Thai iced tea - standard
Consistently awesome. I've been coming here for years on annual trip with friends and the food is just incredible.  The crispy duck in red curry, drunken crispy prawns are favs.  I enjoy these dishes at other places but they nail it. It's beyond discovered so make reservations
Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian/vegan options. I always have to adjust my order to fit my dietary needs and then pray it comes out correctly. My suggestion is to walk across the parking lot to Komol Thai, way better and more bang for your buck!
After reading plenty of good reviews, I ignored my instincts and took the wife to lunch here.  Full disclaimer - I'm not a huge fan of thai food since I don't like coconut.  We looked over the giant menu, but settled on the lunch buffet since that's what the majority of people were eating (there were at least 10 people at the buffet the entire time we were there.)  It was cheap, both in terms of price and quality.  Nothing really stood out to me - I'm having a hard time remembering what I even found edible.  I wanted to like this place, but everything waspretty mediocre and forgettable.  Maybe if we'd ordered off the menu, my review would be different.  But I doubt I'll get the chance to try that - too many good restaurants in Vegas to return to one that left me this underwhelmed.
Very delicious. Great flavor. Their medium spicy was indeed medium. Recommend the green curry :)
Scuzzy outside , creepy parking lot, 40 minute wait. A tiny price to pay to get to eat here! OMG. I could eat here everyday! Here's a tip. Make sure to lock your car , and make reservations !!. . Must try; all the soups . Stuffed chicken wings and something you can't pronounce!
Overall good Thai food. It was annoying that they really skimp on the rice and charge for extra. Recommend the Khao Soi.
I think maybe it was too hyped up for me. I mean, people driving hundreds of miles just to eat here? Not buying it. Overall, the food was very good but it didn't really knock my socks off or anything. Though I sometimes wonder if Thai food can ever knock my socks off. . . We went on a Monday at about 7 pm and there was no wait at all. The restaurant is in a questionable appearing strip mall with plentiful parking. The inside of the restaurant is deceptively huge. . . Our waitress was very nice and informative. When we asked for recommendations, she knew her stuff and was ready with some excellent options immediately. The medium spicy was actually a little on the spicier side which makes me shudder to think of what their spicy is..... . I do, however, highly recommend the Panang short ribs. Less impressed by the garlic prawns. The tom kha gai soup was good but not the best.
Didn't like anything.  Yeah, I said it.  I  didn't enjoy Lotus of Siam.  After all of the hype I was really disappointed with this place.  I didn't like the food and can't believe people actually wait in line for this place.  . . I can appreciate an "Old School Gem" but this place is just old. What a dump!  This hole in wall is in a terrible area of town too.. . Not a fan and will never return.  . . My taste buds deserve better~
Ok it's more like 2.5 stars.. Il make this review quick n straight to the point..the food is good.. I ordered the pad tai,  pad see wu,  Isaan sausage,  stuffed chicken wings n hot n sour soup.. Liked everything especially the stuffed chicken but not worth the wait and my biggest downer.... The portion size! . I know plenty of Thai restaurants w same quality food w way bigger portions.. I get the food is good but give us more!. . One more thing.. One of there desserts was the mango w sticky rice. When i tried to order it they said mangos were not in season... Uh I just bought mangos at the market n had mangos at a restaurant in aria.. So how can it be out of season.?
SOLID FOUR STARS. . . We had the crispy duck in penang curry and the soft shell crab noodles (both Yelp recommendations).  Both were awesome!!. . We like it so much we had dinner there again 2 nights later!!. . One tip is to get there early (when they open).  We got there at 5:30 and didn't have a wait for our party of four.  By the time we were leaving the waiting area was full.... . This place has ruined me for other Thai places.  It will be the place I will compare ALL other Thai food to!
One of the best Thai I've had the pleasure of eating.
Food took forever, but it was delicious.. I wish I knew what I ate, but my cousin the foodie did the ordering.. . My first visit here last September, I didn't love the food because she ordered a bit too exotic for me. . . This next visit, she played it safe and ordered the beef and noodles, some jalapeno shrimp on cabbage thing, and I can't remember what else. . I must say the "noodles," which aren't very noodley but rather flat and wide and irregular shaped, were fantastic. The shrimp dish was good, but I had to wipe some of the peppers off.  our appetizer was yummmmmmy too, chicken on a stick :). . The mouse-sh*t pepper condiment nearly killed me, but they were delicious.. . Only complaint (besides the wait between appetizer and entree) would be the rice. It was a bit hard in my opinion.
Great food and excellent service. Server made thoughtful recommendations with what I actually wanted in mind. I'm not local, I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas! Don't let the rundown look of the outside turn you away. Lotus is the real deal.
Great spot for lunch. Opens at 11:30 so there was no wait since we were a little early. Yes, it's in a sketch part of town. Yes it's in an odd old strip mall. I decided to do the buffet for lunch since I was having a breakdown committing to one dish. I'll probably not do the buffet next time, but it was a good gateway intro to Lotus.
Lotus really was THE place to come in Vegas for great Thai...4 years ago.... . Lotus does a lot right.  They have a great menu with many options from the Northern and Southern regions of Thailand.  But they got too popular for their own good, and like often happens, the quality slipped away.  They are the quintessential spot for inconsistency in my book--putting out incredible dishes on one trip, and offering up apathetic shadows of a former self the next.  I have been over a dozen times and the last 4 or 5 times left me with this sentiment deeply ingrained in my heart, soul, and mind...when they are on though, they certainly do put out some special dishes!
There's something satisfying about stuffing my face with delicious Thai food moments before slipping on a bodycon dress for a night of clubbing on The Strip. God bless being in my midtwenties.. . Get anything with the chu chee sauce. You won't regret it.
I was in Vegas with my wife last weekend and heard about this must go, best in country Thai restaurant. I will say that our first impression of this place was not good at all. It's not the unassuming building or the location. It's the buffet lunch that they put out there. DON'T try the buffet lunch. Again, DON'T get the buffet lunch. It's terrible. We were there around 12:30 on a Friday and  the steam table trays were half empty. They also took their time replenishing the food, which was slightly better than mediocre, which is not saying much. Service for the buffet was also terrible. Seems like the wait and kitchen staff were more intent on taking care of the menu customers than the buffet customers. I don't understand why restaurants do this. If you are going to offer a buffet, at least keep it hot and full at all times even if the food is not good. If we didn't know about this place, the buffet experience would have turn us off completely and we would never come back. I am tempted to give this place a 3 star except that the food off the menu was so much better and a better representation of this place.. . We came back again with great trepidation to try out the menu. Our buffet experience was so bad that we almost didn't come back. We were glad to give them one more chance. They have a great menu and offered northern dishes that we don't see a lot. Food came out quickly and the wait staff was always attentive (unlike the Buffet). Garlic Prawns were fantastic as were the sour rice salad, Khao Soi and the other dishes that we ordered. Their food certainly had more depth to it than what you would find at a typical place.. . Ultimately, was this the best Thai restaurant in the nation, probably not. The lunch buffet was a waste of time and money. It shouldn't even be offered for a restaurant like this, where the menu is the gem. However, the menu item were certain unique and good enough that we will come back next time we are in town. for the menu items, NOT the buffet.
This is the best Thai restaurant. I eat Thai in every city that I travel to. I would recommend if you go with a group, order multiple entrees and serve family style. Two must entrees. Duck panang curry and Seabass drunken noodles. However, I've tried most everything and there is nothing I didn't like.
