This restaurant was a mixed review from me for a few reasons.. . 1) The menu does not indicate that shrimp is added to marinade sauces, kimchi, ground into patties, etc. LET THEM KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SHRIMP ALLERGY. I didn't know when I ordered the Kalbi burger so I am thankful that 2) happened.. . 2) I got a wrong burger (it happens everywhere, so I'm chill with it)! I felt bad for whoever's burger I got, because it looked delicious but I cut it in half and instead of the Kalbi burger with kimchi I found... bacon? The waiter was very quick to take it away to replace it, but when I mentioned my shrimp allergy he told me that shrimp was in almost everything! Did I not read the menu very well? I couldn't find a warning anywhere when I went online and skimmed it.. . 3) The replacement burger they gave me just had lettuce and the spicy mayonnaise on it. Turns out, the kimchi also had shrimp (a lot of kimchi doesn't have shrimp, so I didn't think to ask if it wouldn't have any shrimp) so instead of being given the option to change my burger, they just gave me a very plain burger.. . 4) The plain burger was decently moist, the bun had the right amount of crispiness. The spicy mayo was delicious!. . 5) Service was quick and good.. . So for all that the burger was good and the fries decent (parmesan, truffle oil, something fries), the lack of clarity on their menu for shrimp related items left me very disappointed and almost sick. Decent and quick service but it left something to be desired when I got the wrong burger and then a slightly plain burger to finish off the night without any choice for a change.. . *Update: Boyfriend suggested it after seeing it on the Food Network.
Truly a great meal!  Went as a party of 4 and we were all very impressed by the meal.  . . The pork belly steamed buns were delicious.  The pork was perfect, the buns were light and fluffy.  The dipping sauce on the side added great flavor and was a perfect compliment.. . We shared a couple orders of fries and sweet potato fries for the table.  Defiantly a shareable side.  The sweet potato fries were the table favorite.  Great flavor, horseradish dipping sauce was a tasty addition.. . The burgers were huge!  They were juicy and delicious.  . . The location is easy to find.  Great little place to grab a tasty meal at a very reasonable price.
Do yourself a favor, and head over to Bachi Burger ASAP! The ingredients are so fresh, and each burger is bursting with great flavors. I absolutely love this place!
The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are amazing, so many wonderful flavors and textures on hot fries, bomb! I'm from Hawaii, so I love Teriyaki burgers... the Ronin did not disappoint, oishii! The best Asian fusion burger I've had. The Pb Chocolate Souffle is oozing with warm chocolate and peanut butter with vanilla ice cream, oh baby! I will be back for more :)
The wait was 20 mins long when we arrived on a Sunday at noon. We ordered a spicy miso burger, ronin burger, and a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers definitely have an asian flare to them. I can definitely tell that the restaurant provided us with fresh ingredients. I think we inhaled the burgers in less than 10 mins. The burgers aren't cheap, but certainly aren't expensive considering that you are paying forquality.
Burger GODS~  Flew in from Minnesota to have a burger, worth the flight!  Can't wait to come back!
The wait was a bit of a disappointment 30 to 45 min for a burger joint but I have been wanting to try this place forever. It was packed and I felt as though they squeezed you in no matter if you are a couple inches from the next table. . . Overall the burgers were really good I had the Kiki and loved every bite of it my friend had the spicy miso burger looked good but I did not want to try it since I hate egg. My daughter had the kids burger and it was a huge burger we were very surprised! . . Prices were a bit high considering you  have to order your fries separately but I would be back the burger is calling my name!
The wait can be ridiculous but  I always get VIP treatment and not have to wait EVER. Unlimited iced matcha green tea and cherry yuzu soda, FTW! They have specials: crab dip and manga burger. Some make it to the regular menu, some don't. My faves include: shogun burger, miyagi san burger, Kiki's burger, steamed buns (pork belly or duck), sausage and truffle parmesan fries.. . Shogun Burger:. Wagyu Beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear,  miso butter  and Yamamomo peach on the side. It's very rich and fatty but oh, so delicious! It's worth the $26! 5/5. . Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns/ Pork Belly Steamed Buns: . DuckBreast, cilantro, scallions,  radish,  boiled egg, Hoisin BBQ sauce. The buns are fluffy and the duck skin is nice and crisp, the duck meat is tender and juicy. Pork Belly is fatty good. 5/5. . Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage:. Sausages with a side of honey mustard. A great appetizer. 5/5. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:. With garlic aioli  and fried egg on top. The chili itself is a bit sweet for my taste. Not my favorite thing on their menu but it's still good and worth a try. 4/5. . Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries:. Sprinkled with Maui onion sea salt  and garlic chili aioli on the side. The dipping sauce is good, the fries are ok. 3/5. . Truffle Parmesan Fries:. Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. This is one of my favorite fries in Vegas/Henderson. Very tasty! 5/5. . Ronin Burger:. Angus beef with caramelized onions, coleslaw,  miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and  yuzu aioli. Refreshing because of the yuzu and rich beacause of the egg. 5/5. . Kiki's Burger:. Angus Beef  with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade,  Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.. . Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger:. Wagyu beef with chili mayo,  fried egg,  furikake, caramelized bacon,  fried onion rings. This and the Shogun burger are the best burgers on their menu. It's a thich burger so you have to cut it in half and press it down just so it would fit in your mouth. 5/5
Khalbi you're the best!! It's a kimchi burger- I thought it would taste funny- kimchi on a burger but I gave it a try- and hola! This is now my fav here! Kiki's good too! And their garlic fries and their.. Oh well! Everything's good! Fine. Period.
Tried the bahn mi burger and it was excellent and cooked to perfection.  Had to come the next day to try the Ronin and liked this one just as much. What are you waiting for? Doesn't get any better than this for burger lovers.
This place is dope-- diverse selection on the menu of quality fusion food, pop electronic dance music, and really nice and attentive staff. Our waitress was Kaitlyn whom was genuine and nice and we had the Mr. Ho burger and the Ronin burger which were super flavorful. I'm a foodie from LA, so this was up to par! Try it.
The burgers are the best in town!  Only thing that hurts the rep is the spotty service.  Mr. Miyagi and kimchee burger are my favs!
I love Bachi Burger! The food is great quality and thankfully they are more than open to modification (in my case for allergies).
This place is a MUST GO whenever you visit Vegas. I wish they had one in Cali. . . My boyfriend and I always get top notch service here. This is our second time here in two years. They are so tentative and made sure we were happy throughout out meal. . . Let's start with the basic. . Oh dear lord. THE BURGERS!!  The first night we touch down on Vegas we came here! Boyfriend and I had the kiki burger and miyagi San burger with a side of salt and pepper fries. Everything was made to perfection. I felt like lord Jesus Christ came down and blessed my burgers. It was truly  amazing. All the ingredient mashed together and made sweet love in my mouth. . . The fries!! We usually get the truffles but the salt and pepper was to die for. With some jalapeno sprinkled on it? Ingenious. Simply ingenious. And the portions were a hefty amount I wouldn't be surprise if they used an entire ox in my fries... . .  The last night we were in Vegas we wanted to go out with a bang. So we had the shogun burger with ox tail fries. I personally like the salt and pepper fries but the ox tail was good too for you meat lovers. . . People probably be like damn girl. You paid 26 dollars for a burger? You bet. And id do it again in a heart beat. . . I don't know what they did to their burgers but oh my oh my, your in for a treat. If your in Vegas, you have to try this place!! It's worth every penny. . . Jackiee approved.
**VEGAS MUST!** don't waste time & empty tummies on buffets/hotels. Get yourself in here! I'm a big burger person, & this has to be the best burger in Nevada (& maybe even best burger out of Cali!) . . Burgers are juicy & absolutely mouthwatering. They don't come w/ fries or a side but make sure you order the GARLIX PARM FRIES! Some complain about the bun being too "oily," but trust me, take a bite first. Service can be a hit or miss here, but the food is well worth it! I ALWAYS make a trip here when I'm in town. Actually, I just recently went twice in a row because my party loved it so much! . . Faves: Miyagi,spicy miso, Kiki, Ronin, Kalbi,.. Ugh just all of them. Don't forget the garlic parm fries, oxtail chili cheese fries, & garlic edamame. Yuuum!. . Gourmet burger deliciousness, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!
The food here is cooked right and no short cuts are taken. The menu is creative and well thought out. The only area that needs improvement is the service. I have visited many time and have yet to have decent service. hard to get refills and forget about the server coming back  to check on you once you have the food, except to bring you the bill!. . Worth the food, not the service!
Wasn't as good the second time around but I don't know if that was influenced by the horrible service.  Usually don't complain about service cuz I'm just there because the food tastes good however they were horrible top to bottom this time. Our waiter, the server, the bartender, the host, the cook... Ok probably not that far but all the others mentioned did seem to irk us in some manner that night, albeit slow service or simple lack of attentiveness. Felt bad that I blew this place up to all my friends. And btw the burger was just ok this time.
the miyagi burger is the most DELICIOUS burger i've had in my life...don't be discouraged about the fried egg, (even though i like fried eggs) you can't even tasted it when combined with the bacon, onion rings and whatever sauce/spices they put on it...uuhhh i want another! . . also, the service was excellent.
Had my fair share of a few burgers here, and I will say, It's food that evokes a "wow" response and steady head nod of pleasant surprise and satisfaction. . . Although all their burgers are awesomely crafted and unique in their own respective category, my personal favorites to my taste would have to be both the Miyagi-Sans burger and the Black & Green burger.. . The Miyagi-san is a grass fed wagyu burger with furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. The flavors aren't overdone and easily craveable. As for the Black & Green, it's a grass fed waygu as well, with mushrooms, spinach, point reyes blue cheese (Medium/full flavored), roasted garlic and bacon. Very deep and rich without being too strong and overpowering. If you are a fan of blue cheese this burger does your fandom some righteous justice. Bonus is that their buns are fresh, sweet and made local! Mmm, respect.. . For fries, I go for the Truffle Parmesan and if I have a partner to share with, the oxtail chili fries is the perfect plate with plenty to go around. for dessert, I have only had the chance to try their donuts. Covered in some quality cinnamon sugar and matched with a perfectly complimenting mocha ice cream. Although, tends to be a bit doughy and undercooked as I have come to find.. . Service is service, nothing really outstanding or outlandish, but prompt and knowledgeable about their food. All in all I appreciate this place because the attention to quality and detail, and in that respect they put out some amazingly delicious and unique food.
The mad geniuses behind these crazy and amazing burgers at Bachi should receive a Nobel  Prize for their contributions to to mankind. Not to mention the fact that they have also curated a baddass beer list to accent every bite.  #hitachinoFTW . . Now while there isn't much that I can't tell you that hasn't already been talked about what I can offer you is a secret recipe for a Burger Boner which I came to acquire after eating the following items.  Please see below for the formula and note that you can substitute any variety of beer to achieve said boner, however the other 3 items must be eaten in their entirety.. . Bachi Pickles + Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries + Hitachino + Shogun Burger =  BURGER BONER
Try my trio pick... Miyagi San Burger, Pork Belly Bao and The Oxtail Chili Fries. Bomb! Great Food and Great Service. Love it!!! I'll be back.
My favorite burger in Vegas.  . . Sure, it's expensive and my wife will argue that it isn't that great...  But Monkey don't care.  This my favorite burger in Vegas.  Asian fusion burgers.  Come, sit, have a beer and some pickled vegetables.  . . STEAMED BAO (Duck) - Delicious, savory and tastiest part of duck between steamed pillows and onion. BLACK & GREEN BURGER - Soft, puffy toasted bun, grass-fed beef, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, blue cheese and roasted garlic... omg i'm gonna drop everything and head over there now!  . CHILI EDAMAME - disappeared sooner than later. BRANDY SHAKE - brandy in a shake.  perfect dessert!  can i have a double, to go?  it's legal to walk around Vegas with alcohol, right?  . . Seated at small table right in front of kitchen doors, register, middle between bar and the rest of restaurant, we were never short of attention or water.  Busy busy time this evening, we were definitely not ignored, but would have enjoyed another table without the servers rushing about us on either side.  Monkey's a loyal customer and will definitely save up to return.
First impressions: with a group of traveling coworkers the three check per table maximum suggested we couldn't eat here since we all needed separate checks. When we said we had to go, the server said he could accommodate. In the bathroom the hot water didn't work. Toilet didn't flush. Unimpressed up front.. . The burger and fries were good but for my $20 I'd go somewhere else.
My husbands friend kept bugging us to eat here on our next trip to Vegas. I'm glad he did, because we loved it! The burgers are as good as they are varied. The beef was first rate. They have Angus and Wagayu, cooked perfectly. The house pickles are tasty and different. The garlic was my favorite. I had the Kiki burger, with 3 kinds of mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and ailoi sauce,  and other half had the miso burger with fried egg. Both were 5 star delicious and juicy. The house made buns were fluffy and light. I also had the Kumai cocktail of sake, vodka, pineapple, cherry and mint. Delicious...not strong, but good. The atmosphere was hip, casual and fun. The server was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. We will be coming back!. . Secondly, to 'Johnny U', if you arein fact, sadly, a real person, or an imposter, which is even sadder: Your review bemoaning the supposed asian takeover of the food universe, and the pains of being a white couple 'weird'ed out among 'oriental folk',  stupidly demanding your ketchup and mustard to put on gourmet fusion burgers, the solution to your problem is simple... like you...just put on your big girl panties, tug on those Daisy Dukes you should have quit wearing in high school and drive on over to Burger King, because let me tell you, even In and Out is too good for you.
I liked my burger here, yes. But the BEST burger in Nevada? I don't know about that.... . They have an extensive menu with lots of options but I recommend sticking to a burger and fries (or some pork belly buns for those of you who don't like burgers!). We did NOT like the oxtail chili-cheese fries or the Bachi Caesar salad we ordered. My suggestion is stick to the regular fries without all that gamey meat and what not added on top!!! & do NOT order a salad LOL I give you permission to be a fattie for this entire meal, it was one of the worst caesar salads I've had and we ended up only taking a few bites and then throwing the rest away. . . The pork belly steamed buns were delicious! Too bad you only get three for the price, but I actually enjoyed these more than the burgers. I thought that the burgers were good but nothing really blew my mind away. The buns were just your average buns, pretty good but nothing spectacularly soft like some people say. I think your burger experience really depends on which burger you order because all of the extra fixings they put in your burger determines what it tastes like. . . My favorite burger out of the three I tried was the RONIN burger!! Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, and all of these delicious sauces... What's not to love?!?! The Shogun burger has a lot of hype because of the foie gras in it but none of the boys liked it. I thought it was tasty, BUT very sweet! due to all the fruit in it and perhaps more suited towards a girl's taste palate. However, there were a lot of different flavors and it could get a little overwhelming if you had to eat the entire thing.. . The miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu burger tasted just like a good ol' fashioned BBQ burger if that's what you like but I felt that it was something I could get at a lot of other restaurants and a little plain for me especially after trying all of the other burgers bursting with flavors.. . If you live in the area and like burgers, you should definitely check this place out. We had a good dinner but I don't know if I'd particularly recommend going out of your way if you're only visiting for the weekend and taking the drive off the strip to eat one of these burgers.
Great burgers and the oxtail chili fries are sinfully delightful!!  Have been here a few times and have never been disappointed.
Husband and I stopped by for lunch. It was ok. The Parmesan truffle fries with the dip were delicious. The kalbi burger my husband had was incredibly salty and my ronin burger wasn't quite well done. There was a weird tasting dressing paste deal that didn't agree with my taste buds. I find this place to be more of an acquired taste. It was very nice inside and clean. Service was excellent. Not a bad place just not for us I guess..
I went on a last minute one-day trip to Vegas for Jay-Z's magna carter world tour and a friend of mine told me to stop by this place. When I first walked in, I knew this place was going to be worth my wait. In fact, I didn't wait very long. I ordered the bachi fish burger and may I add that it was freaking delicious!! Everyone is super friendly and the food is great. I love this place and will add it to my "must go to every time I visit Las Vegas" list!
The 45 minute wait was worth it. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had, plus great sweet potato and truffle garlic fries. The unique dipping sauces they offer are fantastic. Try the Black And Green burger. So freakin good.
Really don't care for burgers!!!!  Went to Bachi Burger with friends and found out what a great burger is.  Now every time we have friends in town or even family we all head to Bachi Burger for a great Burger experience.. . If you want a great experience you need to check this place out!!!!
One of the best burgers I've ever had.  I ordered the Shogun burger and was completely blown away.  If you can get by the $26 price tag, this is one killer burger.  Foie gras, eel, pear, miso butter - my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  My wife had the Kiki's burger and was very happy with her selection (but envious of my burger once she had a bite.)  We also tried the pickle appetizer (meh), the oxtail chili cheese fries and the salt and pepper fries (both very good.)  I had 2 different ciders (who's names I don't remember), and they were both excellent.  While the prices are high, this place is on the same level as Umami Burger - only better.  And I hear they are opening a few soon in LA - a definitely place to check out if you see one.
Yes my friends and I might've came in on their last call for everything but, as a paying customer wise?  You still have to cater to your guest! Period! I have been in the business for 18 years now, from front of the house to being a chef. . To be honest, I do not like to be rushed when I just barely sat down and have not seen the menu! . Anyways, enough with the bitching!  Food so far is not bad , came out fairly quick though?  Hmmmm? .  Pork belly bao,  great flavor on point but came out cold! Like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a minute.  Portions on the onion rings? Too little for the portion.... . Like I said, food is good. But service could be better!
Good as usual. Small, kind of loud but a great burger and fries. Real good flavoring and a decent beer list.
Sort of a long wait but worth it. The foods great and theambience is great too. We had a wonderful server who checked on us at the right times. I tried the miyagi San and it was the bomb I usually just get the Kiki but the Miyagi San was really good along with the Parmesan truffle fries and red velvet shake. Mhmmm
Best burger I have ever eaten in my life is the Shogun burger. I think that says a lot for anyone who has eating many burgers in their time living in the USA. This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever.. . The Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING!. . The only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last.. . The pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats!
This place was a little over-hyped for me.. . First thing first.  The wait was around 30min-40min on a Sunday (lunch time). Anyways, the host comes out lets people know there is open sitting at the bar and we immediately go in.  The hosts disappears, so we ask the manager if we could sit at the bar cause it was open sitting (just to make sure), but he tells us to wait and he'll ask the host.  We wait, until two gentlemen behind us, just walk and take those two seats at the bar. WTF? Kind of pissed off, the host eventually comes and we tell her our story and she says there is nothing she can do (-____-).  Keep in mind the MANAGER probably forgot to ask the host, cause she didn't even have a clue.  We get the manager and he eventually finds us a seat at the bar...... . Anyways. The FOOD:. . Miyagi Sans Grass fed Wagyu Burger  - Furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. Pretty good, but not the best burger though. We asked for a medium, but the burger was almost well done.... . Ronin Burger - Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, with some type of aoili on the side. This burger was ok. Not what I expected. The caramelized onions were a little too sweet and there were tons of it on the burger.. . Oxtail chili cheese fries - The chili was a bit on the sweeter side, not your typical "chili", but it was different.  This was very filling, try to split with someone. . . Maybe next time I'll try the pork buns, since I heard it was good... but who knows.
Amazing!!! It seems like all the menu items were very well thought out as all the items we ordered were executed and put together very well. . . Location is clean, organized, and the servers are very attentive.. . Truffle fries are DIVINE. Can't wait to come back  so I can pig out again!
Definitely worth the price. I recommend trying the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries. The restaurant is nice and our server was very friendly and gave great suggestions. It can get pretty packed during the weekends so plan accordingly.
1st complaint- Completely overpriced.  $12 burgers with no side and a $10 beer!. . 2nd complaint- Burgers were eh. Asked for medium, got practically rare. Flavorless. N-N-Out makes a better burger for a fraction of the cost.. . 3rd Complaint- I'm in my 30's and I don't love loud music but I don't mind it and it's not something I would usually complain about but when techno trance music is playing so loud on a Monday afternoon that you can't even have a conversation with your own party... it's too loud. . . Last and BIGGEST complaint- I'm still in shock by this... I ordered iced green tea.  I took one drink, it was horrible. Tried to pass it along to my friends but everyone thought it was horrible. I told the waitress she could take it because I didn't like it.  Her very first response was "Well did you already drink out of it?"  What??!!  Are you kidding me?!  What was she gonna do, give it to someone else?  My natural response to her was "of course, that's how I know I don't like it!"   Her next response shocked me more than the first... I kid you not, she said "Hmmmm, I'll have to find out about this"   HMMMM????  . I almost walked out then.  She came back several minutes later to let me know her manager would take it off the bill this time.  If I would have drank half the tea, I'd understand but there were 3 drinks taken out of it.  Worst manager ever! . . Waitress was all around horrible btw.  The whole experience was horrible.. . $70 for 3 people. 3 burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 beer.
Love love love yummmmmmmm!   My favorite burger place ever!
hands down one of the best burger spots around.  burgers run about $10 but they r damn good.  I really liked the ox tail fries but one knock on it for me is the beans. not a fan of beans in my chili. other than that, all the workers in their were nice and attentive.  If ur not fond of sweet burgers the ronin and Kiki burgers were on the sweeter side.
The Ronin!
This is my second time coming here and I ordered the ronin burger. The burger had an egg carmalized onions in a tonkatsu sauce and I think it was cabbage. Its a decent sized burger and it tasted really good. I just wish that the egg was runnier. We also ordered the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Which were pretty good. We had two orders of fries and split between 4 people. Most likely youre looking at a $16. But it is well worth it.
for yelpers from california that know about Umami burger, think about this place like that but the burgers portion are bigger. its one of those "asian fusion" east meets west interpretation kidda food but in this case it works! food are great and delicious tho i took out 1 star because of the service.. . definitely gonna go back the next time we go back to Vegas! tho i heard their opening one here in Cali!
This place knows how to make a mean burger. Their ingredients are paired so well and everything is delicious! . . They're a bit pricey but it's worth it every once in a while. I ordered the Kiki burger, and will definitely be getting it again.
Bachi = short for Hibachi = Grill. . My friends kept raving about this place and telling me to try it, so I went here on my recent trip to Vegas. I got here late in the afternoon at around 3 PM, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good considering the other reviews I've read. . . We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, Wagyu burger, and the Kiki burger. The truffle parmesan fries were ok. I'm not too sure I liked the truffle sauce that much. It tasted very similar to Asian cafe mushroom sauce to me, but a little saltier and tangier. I think I would have enjoyed the fries more if it had just parmesan on it. . . While we were waiting for our burgers, I noticed the staff was in disarray. I saw way too many employees in the restaurant, and all of them were running around looking frazzled. The guests sitting at the table next to me were unhappy and complained about their burgers taking a long time. Our waiter later explained to us that they were having a problem with the computer system. I'm guessing some of the orders did not get put into the system, which caused the delay. Despite that, it seemed like a bad day for the staff. Our waiter did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. When my husband told the waiter later that he did not get to tell him how he wanted the burger cooked, the waiter said he thought he said medium. Actually, I was the one who said medium. My husband always prefers his meats rare, so it's not possible for him to say medium. . . Anyway, when the burgers came out, they looked just like they look in the pictures: juicy and delicious. I was quite pleased with my Kiki burger, although I found it just a tad sweet. I enjoyed all the flavors mixed in together with the shiitake mushrooms, juicy Angus burger, the veggies, and the soft bread. I had a bite of the Wagyu burger and immediately fell in love with the Wagyu. I think I might have liked the Wagyu more than my Angus burger! . . I can see why people wait for this restaurant. It's one of the better burgers I've tasted, but the way that the restaurant was being run could have been a lot smoother, especially with all those employees. I'd like to come back to Bachi, but I hope that the restaurant will operate much more fluidly when I return. It would be good if they could expand outside of Vegas and open it in Los Angeles. I bet it would be a hit!. . UPDATE: They're opening one on Sawtelle!
One of my favorite burger places in town. First off, the oxtail chili cheese fries. Normally, I'm not a fan of chili, but I would eat a bowl of this stuff any day. It's not overloaded with cayenne or chili powder like some chilis, but is perfectly balanced. Smoky from the spices, rich from the oxtail and a creaminess from the fried egg on top. Put that on top of their crispy, fresh from the fryer French fries and you've got the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! . Second, again, fries. This time, the Parmesan truffle fries. The sauce is a mushroom puree of sorts with truffle, and lots of shredded Parmesan. It comes with a sun dried tomato aioli, but I prefer the truffle sauce poured over the top. Delicious. . And finally, the burger. This is the best burger in town. Now, I'm a simple person, not into anything complicated on my burger. I get the custom, the Angus with bacon and cheddar. Sounds pretty basic, right? Wrong. We'll start with the bun. They bake their buns in-house, a sweet, light, almost Hawaiian bun taste to them. They come out crispy and buttery, slowly absorbing the juices from the bacon and burger, and simply wonderful. Now, the bacon. Somehow, they've managed to make bacon even better. It's applewood smoked and caramelized, giving it that extra depth of flavor. A sweet and smoky taste in addition to the typical salty, porky flavor of bacon. Finally, we come to the burger. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked a beautiful medium, perfect grill marks. It's a masterpiece of a beef patty. I can't give this place enough praise. Everything I've tried there has been delicious, but the three listed are easily my favorite. If I could, I'd eat there every week. Five stars. Ten out of ten. A+
I guess I am the only one who hated the food at this place.. . First of all the service was not good, it took quite awhile longer than one would expect to get our burgers. I got the 'Black and Green Burger' which was recommended to me by the server. This had a very strong and weird alcoholic taste to it. It was gross. And by gross I don't mean it was only "decent" I truly mean it was gross. . . I will never go back.
"What's furikake?" asked one of our table-mates. "Some lettuce thing", our server so eloquently replied. Yeahhh noooo. From that point on, I knew I wouldn't particularly like it... . But the burger proved me wrong. I don't remember what it was called, but it was the pork and beef one, with the taro bun. The bun didn't have much taro flavor, but was a gorgeous color. The seasoning and sauce on the burger were sweet but not overly so. With the pork in the patty, I think it went well together.. . FYI furikake is a type of seasoning, usually a mix of seaweed, sesame seeds, dried and ground fish/veggies that you put on rice.
both my husband and I got sick. Yea I just can't even come back...like ever. I'm not sure which part of the meal got us like this but we were messed up.
Best burger in town, must try the Miyagi burger.  Delicious meat with crunchy onion rings and bacon within.
