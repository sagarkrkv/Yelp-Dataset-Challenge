Wow,  one-of-a-kind the seafood it was amazing,  tasty and price fair . definitely will go back again and again. Service was extremely good
My husband and I LOVE Stone Crab. When we were in town and at Ceasars before a show we were delighted to see this restaurant. . . The interior is classy, slightly antiquated but very pleasant and comfortable. My husband got steak which was amazing. Probably the best we've had since Peter Luger in NYC. That is a HUGE compliment coming from us. I got the stuffed sole. The portion was small but very tasty. . . We got the Stone Crab appetizer which was incredibly delicious and probably the best deal on the menu. . . The server was very friendly and accommodating. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it's a little pricey. . . There are a ton of food options in Vegas and we've tried many of them. This is the only place we will make a point to return to. Excellent!
Love stone crabs!  So good!! And I haven't been anywhere else where I have seen stone crabs on the menu so it's always a must do when in Las Vegas!  The restaurant is nice, the service was great!  Have to love the bread basket - my favorite would be the pretzel bread and they give you more if you ask, no problem.  Dessert was fantastic too!!!!!  Their key lime pie is their signature - and it is a definite must do!
Everything here is great from the service to the wine list, but I only have one very serious recommendation. King Crab Legs! Served table side with drawn butter. Yes they are expensive, but absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. They redefine what crab should taste like and you should not leave here without trying them. I split a caesar salad and an order of the legs with my mom and it was more than enough food.. I will be back for the legs!
I can't say anything bad about this place it's been almost a week since I ate here and I'm still thinking about this place... The waitress was amazing, the atmosphere was amazing, and the food was breathe taking. I had the Shrimp dinner and I was blown away. Fresh large shrimp cooked to perfection. My best friend who was celebrating her birthday had the Filet Mignon and she is also still talking about it. The Mac n cheese and potatoes were also amazing! The Brownie Ice Cream Combo that was served for my friends was amazing as well. I seriously would return to vegas just for this place!
Service: 3/5; Food: 4/5; Location: 2/5 (only because the hostess didn't know where she worked - see below). Overall: 3.5/5 - Would come back for the food and to try the Stone Crab.. . My friends and I came here pretty late with reservations at 9:30PM. (PS: Make sure to have reservations). I'll tell you now, but this restaurant is in Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. For some reason, when we called the restaurant to ask where the restaurant was, I was told it was in the Cosmopolitan. When I called a second time, I was told it was near Planet Hollywood. FINALLY, on the THIRD call, (keep in mind I was in a taxi the whole time) I was told that it was at Caesar's Palace. Ugh. Come on now. You don't even know where you're working at!? The service, even at 9:30PM, was just alright, which is a bit disappoint since it is Vegas. We had to flag down someone several times to get our water cups filled and the food came out slowly. Our server looked and acted doubtful toward us as if he was judging us by how young we looked. (Asians just naturally look younger, but we ARE legal!!) . . The food itself is definitely high quality and somewhat small portions; on top of the fact that it is Vegas, the prices were definitely price-y. The Stone Crab was sold out (tip: come early if you want to try), so we settled for the king crab, six oysters, and salt and pepper shrimp. What I enjoyed was that with the crab, there was someone who would open the crab in front of you. Served with butter and lemon, the crab had a nice, sweet flavor with great texture. The oysters were creamy and came with a vinegarette and tabasco sauce. Lastly, our salt and pepper shrimp was fried and paired well with the creamy lemon aioli dip and lemon juice.. . The ambiance is extremely classy and has an upscale vibe. The interior decor is beautiful and seems slightly antique. Suited for both groups or dates; it's both intimate and comfortable. It is dimly light, but somehow the room glows; I'm assuming the light bounces off the decor. . . Overall, would return to try Stone Crab and steak, in addition to their seafood selection; although when I do come back, I hope service to be better considering their reputation is of high quality.
Very good stone crab, crab soup and king crab legs. Service was superb. I did think they rushed us.
We stopped in while shopping for a quick lunch bite at the bar.  We didn't make reservations or had heard of the restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised at our find.  We order some Stone Crab claws and cocktail shrimp.  Excellent late lunch snack! We watched a sporting game on their numerous TVs in the bar while we shared the claws. It's pricey, but it's Vegas!
One of the worst "high-end" steak places we've ever been. We had to send the steak back three times and it still wasn't right. We got the stone crab claws as an appetizer which were just okay but for $60 for a few tiny claws, it wasn't worth it. I had the seared scallops which were dry and not flavorful. Even the brussell sprouts were every dry and unflavorful. This place really misses the mark!
Very pricey for somewhat fancy food. Not a fan of the high top bar tables being used for dining. Feels more like a happy hour bar with 5 star prices. Well prepared food and decent service. Stupid typical Vegas prices for eating out.
This is the Best place in Vegas for seafood!!! Stone Crab to die for. Great service! Pricey but you get what you pay for.
I used to live in South Beach.........loved the Joe's there. . . When we miss Stone Crabs, we go here. . . Love the private rooms for holidays and birthdays. . . Valet is right by their entrance....which is GREAT. . . Service is good.  Portions are perfect.  Yummy food:)
Pros - We had decent service and we liked the taste of the stone crabs. Crab cakes were excellent.. . Cons - Stone crabs are almost impossible to eat without getting shells in your mouth. The shell is hard and it could very easily chip a tooth. Also we ordered the lobster which was pretty pricey. That would have been fine except that it was way overcooked.
My wife and I love this restaurant. Everything on their menu is quite good. We especially loved their Manhatten clam chowder.
Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.. . Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.. . Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). . . Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).. . Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.. . Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.
Outstanding stone crab. Great atmosphere and even greater service.  I highly recommend Joe's if you love great food and service especially if you love to people watch.
Dinner at Joe's was half tasty.. We got to Joe's without a reservation at 6:30. The host told us it would be 30 minutes, but actually had a table for us in 10 minutes. The problem however was that our table was in the over crowded bar and not in the restaurant in the back. We literally had a group of guys leaning on our table for about 10 minutes during our meal. The atmosphere was abhorrent. . The only thing worse than the atmosphere was the service. Our waitress seemed grumpy and unhappy. We ran out of butter for our pre dinner bread, our food took forever to come out and when we were done our meal we waited for lemon water or hot towels, but ended up going got the bathroom to wash our hands. The hot towels arrived approximately 5 minutes after we were done eating. When I am done eating crab I don't want to wait 5 minutes to wipe my hands down. In my opinion the hot towels in a high end steak and seafood joint should be brought out 5 minutes before you are done, not after.. The meal itself was ok. The only thing I would get again was the medium stone crab. We got some of the large and medium, there wasn't much difference in size, and they tasted the same. I think you get more meat for less money with the medium. The mustard sauce they are served with is really good. We ordered fries and onion rings to go with them, the fries were decent, but nothing to write home about. The saddest onion rings in the world are onion straws, and that is what we got. I wanted a solid steakhouse onion ring and instead I got an over salted mess of greasy thin cut onions.. Overall Joes gets a pass from me, but if I was to go back I would have a reservation for the restaurant and I would take a pass on half of what I ordered.
Great eating experience here. From the service to the food. Apparently, this is a famous chain out of Miami. We went here for my sister in-law's 40th birthday dinner. I'll just comment on what I ate.. . 1)Appetizer: Crabcake- $16.00, not very large, split it two ways and it was delicious.. 2) Entree: Lobster stuffed in Sole (fish) with assorted sauces. This was very very tasty and while i'm not a huge seafood fan this was one of my more memorable fish eating experiences.. 3) Desert: Compliments of the house a brownie slice topped with ice cream and whipped creme for her birthday.. well use your imagination on how it tasted.. . Highly recommended and apparently the stone crabs are top notch.
Very mediocre place for the price. I'm glad I didn't order a steak for $50 after tasting the other food. Clam chowder and crab cake were not bad. Fisher mans platter was bad. Chewy seafood and lukewarm to almost cold food. Waiter service also bad. Never came back to check on us until we asked that water be refilled even though she passed by our table many times. For Vegas I would rate the experience poor. Go to sw or mastros or one of the other places in Vegas for just slightly more.
The food was poorly executed and our server was nonexistent. Good thing the busboy was easy to flag down. . . We werent that hungry so got the grilled seafood combo and seafood salad. The snapper in the combo was raw in the middle(this is not seared tuna! ) and just about everything was tasteless. I think I squeezed a whole lemon in my salad to make it somewhat flavorful. They were very stingy with the seafood in my seafood salad as well. They gave us free dessert since the fish was raw but I had no desire to eat it since everything was so bad.
I've been to this location and the location in Chicago a few times, and has been a home run each time!. I will say, that i tried Joe's scallops this time, and wasnt a big fan. I don't like the flour dusted layer on them. I loooooove the taste of scallops, and felt it took away from the great flavour. But otherwise everything else at the table was soooo gooood!. . My Mom had the dover sole, which had tremendous table side service. They fileted the fish right at the table, and not a single bone to be found!. . Great wine list too! . We reserved through Open Table and very lucky we did! The place was rammed by 5:30pm! Definitely recommend reservations!
I wasted  $62 on Joe's Tasteless Crabs. They use another adjective, but it implies how intoxicated one would                   . have to be to hallucinate flavour for these crabs. Squeezing a lemon wedge on them saved them from nothingness. They came with a mustard sauce which obliterated the crab's lack of taste. Unlike this taste violation, their baked tomatoes with spinach puree and cheddar is a wonder to behold, and worth the long walk from the Excalibur. Even their tea was terrible. The service was surly and getting a towel to save my fingers from terminal crabbiness took some doing. I had walked by this restaurant a couple of years ago and thought they must do something wonderful with crabs to name their restaurant Joes Stone Crabs.. Maybe in Miami. Here it is all sauce, and sauceless crabs are tasteless crabs, and a waste of their lives and my dollars. Avoid the universe this restaurant is in.
Went here with the hubby on Tuesday night last week, and dinner was wonderful! I am a HUGE seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places I've had in CA or NV.  The food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.. . It's located at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace on the bottom/street level.  If you are coming from Caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  You'll need to take the escalator down one level.  . . I tried to make a reservation the day before on Open Table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.. . So I called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w/o reservations.  They said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  So I asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.. . So we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  At first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  But seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  So our wait was just 20 minutes.. . Since I'm from So Cal, I can get stone crabs pretty easily at the Fisherman's Wharf in Redondo Beach or even at 99 Ranch supermarket.  They are fairly cheap to buy whole (Santa Barbara stone crabs are about $5/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  So that's why I didn't get stone crabs at Joe's.  But if you haven't had stone crabs before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and I've had all kinds).  They are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.  . . Half-dozen oysters (1 order):. - I forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  I think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  The oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  I could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.. . Fisherman's Platter - Grilled:. - I got this and loved it.  It was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  The server told me ahead of time when I asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  With the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  My husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  The seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  The shrimp were big and crunchy.  The squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  The flavor was overall very good.  I would definitely get this dish again.  . . Lobster-stuffed Sole:. My husband got this and loved it.  In fact, I was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that I had.  The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  The fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.  . . Jennie's Mashed Potatoes:. These were special mashed potatoes that were very good!  They had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  The combination of the mashed potatoes with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  It went perfectly with our meal, and I would definitely get these again.  I don't think I've run into any other place that makes their mashed potatoes like this.  Very good and filling!. . Overall, this is a great seafood place.  If there was one of these places in So Cal, I would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  The service was great and the food was great.  The only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a HUGE group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  Our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  So it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.
NOM NOM NOM. . I started with the wedge salad that was pretty tasty, even with the bleu cheese crumbles! I also had babe start with the Crab Bisque - it' comes in a TINY bowl. Like, it's totally small. I'm not sure if they have other sizes or not but our server didn't ask us if we wanted a bowl or a cup but anyways it was QUITE good. . For my entree it was between the two Scallop meals. I chose the Seared Sea Scallops with braised pork belly, cabbage and kale. The scallops were fantastic and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delish!!! . Friend ordered the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon and it was cooked a perfect Medium Rare. He was actually ranting and raving about how delicious his steak was for DAYS after and he's had some good steaks in his time! . We also had a side order of Stone Crabs which were delightfully cracked already and DELICIOUS! I don't usually like cold crab but it was SO good. . NOM NOM NOM!!. . I just wanted to update that I washere again and sat in the dining room as last time we sat in the bar... The service was phenomenal and I especially loved the lemons and towels they provided at the end of our meal!. The food was FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC as usual especially the GIANT king crab legs! SO. MUCH. MEAT.!!!
Great oysters for happy hour. Friendly staff. I would highly reccomend it. Generous portions with most dishes and great waitstaff.  Definitly one of my favorite places to go on the strip. Highly reccomend it!
