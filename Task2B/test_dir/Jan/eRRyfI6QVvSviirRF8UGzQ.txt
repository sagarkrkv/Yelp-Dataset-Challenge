I came here with some friends for a drink. The drinks were very good. However, drinks are way overpriced ($90 for 5 typical drinks) and service is very bad. Nice atmosphere though. Nobody in this place seemed to like their life. Almost everyone had very nice clothes and jewelry plus money to burn, but the enthusiasm in the gaming area, and throughout the building, was non-existent. I saw no smiles if you don't count the fake one coming from the waitress who came around every 30-40 minutes or so, even though the bar area was far from packed. I recommend going somewhere where people appear happier and you can get twice as many drinks for the price.
I surprised my wife with a last minute trip to Las Vegas to celebrate our 20th anniversary. When I booked the hotel, I had the choice of Encore at Wynn or Four Seasons, unfortunately I chose Encore. My last time making that mistake. . . Originally we had chosen to stay one night at Encore but as soon as we saw our room we decided for a second night. Mistake #2! The first night, the people next door were partying all night and with the bass from the Encore club we never were able to sleep. We complained and nothing was done. . . When we finally were able to start sleeping, one of the drunken idiots from next door decided to bang on our door. He could not distinguish between our door and the other door. After 3 minutes I was able to convince him he was at the wrong room. . . The next morning we asked to change our room due to the music and people next door. At 10am we moved all our belongings to our new room, located in a quieter part of the hotel. We left for breakfast and on our return discovered none of our keys would work for our new room. . . Went to the front desk and explained the keys didn't work. They apologized for the mix up end informed us we were never checked out of the other room or checked into our existing room. Also, we will need to be checked into a new room. He proceeded to give us new keys to a new room. When I explained all our belongs were in the room, he said we will need to move them again. I was fired up. I asked for the manager. I explained the situation to the manager. He was apologetic and explained they had miscommunication on their side. He then gave us new room keys to our existing room. . . We went back to our room with the new keys, which worked. A couple of hours later we went shopping, at the mall located across the street. When we returned to our room, 3 hours later, once again our room keys did not work. This was a reoccurring theme. After dinner, our room keys did not work. When we went out for drinks, our room keys did not work again. Four separate times we were forced to go to the lobby and have our keys programed, which worked once but never again. . . The ironic part is, all the keys failed to work a second time. We were given 3 keys every time and all 3 would not work after a length of time. After reprogram, the keys would get us back in our room but failed to work again. It appeared as if someone or something kept resetting the lock code. . . I can understand one key being rubbed against a magnet (which I don't carry)or electronic device (very rare) but not all three failing, especially if they worked the first time. . . I had no idea this hotel was such a party hotel and has such bad customer service, especially for the price we paid. I could have stayed anywhere else and had a better experience. Thanks Encore for giving us such a great bad memory for our anniversary!!! Never again!
I'm a fan of this hotel. We got a suite on the 63rd floor overviewing the strip, it was awesome. The hotel is very classy and customer service was great. I forgot my hair brush and when I requested one, they brought me a brush and comb right away. I would definitely come here again and paying the extra $50 a night for the view was worth it. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I was a little disappointed with the gambling side of things. When I requested help and pressed the service button on the slot machine, they took over 10 minutes to come and actually never came. So I ended up leaving. Why would a high end hotel like Encore lack service in that department? I don't understand. Anyway, then I went to the red card desk to ask a simple question and was told to get in line to ask the question. It was a yes or no question who wants to get in line for that? I'm a fan of the hotel but when it comes to the casino floor, I rather spend my money elsewhere.
I have been going to Vegas regularly since I turned 21, and even lived there for 3 years.  I have stayed at most of the resorts and stepped foot into all of them on the Strip.  And can now finally say that the Encore is my favorite.  And here is why:. . 1. No strollers allowed.  I have 2 kids and have even been "that mom" pushing a double stroller through a casino.  It is refreshing to not have to maneuver around kids. . 2. It is less crowded. . 3. It is a very classy hotel and casino.  Every time I have visited, I rarely see drunk obnoxious college kids. Perhaps this is because it is at the end of the strip and farther from all the action of the strip.  . 4.  There is no smoking in many of the corridors and walkways. There seem to be a ton of security type personnel around reminding the patrons of this rule.  . 5. Parking is so easy.  I actually hesitate to write the this review because I don't want it to get too crowded.  I love that the parking garage is an easy walk to the lobby.  No need to navigate through shops, etc. . 6. It is beautifully decorated.  I love the lights on the trees as you drive in.  The architecture is nice, and the design is very classy.  . 7. The service is top notch.  Whenever I go, there is someone always ready to hold a door open for me, welcome me with a smile.  I feel like a VIP and I don't need a "Noir Card" to be treated like one.  . 8. The room are clean, elegant and spacious.. 9. I love that there is a huge window to the garden and pool.  It gives it a more open airy feeling, and you don't feel claustrophobic surrounded by 4 walls.  . . Granted, it is one of the more pricier resorts on the Strip- but if you can treat yourself- it is so worth it! Also, I haven't stayed at this resort during pool season, which I have heard gets pretty loud.  So, if you are looking for a more peaceful visit, come in the winter.
Reader, beware: if you're tired of reading all the glowing reviews of this hotel, you might as well stop reading this right now!. . Hand's down, this was the nicest, poshest hotel I've stayed at, ever. It is certainly the nicest one in Vegas. The attention to detail is apparent everywhere, and the hotel itself, and the casino, and all the shops and restaurants within are above reproach. Where to begin?. . Let's start with the hotel room. It's not really a "room"; it's a suite. My folks and I had adjoining room/suites on the 15th floor, overlooking the Strip. Wow, I felt like a movie star! The suite was so beautiful, so roomy and spacious. When you enter, there is a hallway with the bathroom off to the side. The bathroom is huge, with a glass-enclosed shower (GREAT shower, too, with two large shower heads and a marble bench to sit on or, for you ladies out there, to prop a foot to shave your leg! A little detail, but this is what makes this place stand apart from the rest), deep tub, looong marble counter with two recessed sinks, and all the bells and whistles (recessed wall-mounted tv? Check. Scale under the sink? BOO! But yes, check! Complimentary high-end robes and slippers to use? Check! Really fine quality lemongrass citrus gels and shampoos and lotions and potions? CHECK! TONS of towels - which I love, a great hairblower, and a toilet area with a door for more privacy). They really thought of everything. . . The closet area is very roomy with a safe for your valuables.. . Next is the bedroom area. The bed, pillow and linens made for the deepest sleep I've ever had. It was the most comfortable bed I've ever been on. There's an electronic panel bedside to control the drapes and lights. The huge tv separates the bedroom area from the living room area and it swivels 360 degrees. The living room has a deep sectional sofa and ottoman and desk. . . On this floor in this location (end of the hall), we heard no noise. It was super quiet. The only issue I have with the amenities is the mini-bar/fridge/food variety on top of the dresser/bar. You cannot use the fridge (not to keep your Cokes cool, even!), and if you take any snacks off the top of the dresser for more than 60 seconds, you'll get charged for them! So even if you just want to read the label, man, you better read fast! (I thought this was a little over-the-top, and not in keeping with this classy hotel).. . Aesthetics and art and design are subjective entities, but my parents and I just LOVED the design and architecture and lay-out and colors and artwork of this hotel and casino and all its various restaurants and shops. There's a huge de Koons metallic sculpture of tulips in blindingly bright colors. Gorgeous mosaics on floors and walls. Huge bright coral-red chandeliers in the casino. And windows! Windows opening up the place to light! Overlooking formal gardens and waterfalls. . . We walked the Strip and entered all the major casinos and hotels, to get a feel of the different themes and check out the designs and architecture of them all. One thing I will say about the Encore: compared to ALL the other casino/hotels, the smell of cigarette smoke is least noticeable at the Encore. . . One last note: from my 2 shuttle drivers who drove me to this hotel and then back to the airport, to folks we talked to who worked in the stores we shopped in, all said the same thing: that Wynn treats his employees well. Many of these people have applied for jobs at the Encore. I think this speaks volumes.
My first time staying at the Encore, absolutely loved it. The beach encore club is a good hang out day and night, I flew in on the 4th of July. The walk between the Wynn and encore is quite a distance. Make sure you have heels you're prepared to walk in for extended hours. XS is a great club had a blast, the concierge and drivers are very pleasant to accompany you. Will come back for another stay. Also a host by the name of Susan Savage, she is just a doll I love her to pieces she's your go to gal if you're into gambling and what not. She's delightful & so sweet.
The Encore was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at in Vegas.  There are so many useful amenities in the room, the TV and bathroom are very nice, and the view is great!. . Also, I want to point out the staff made everything convenient and they were very helpful.  I will definitely stay here again in the future.
Great rooms. Sinatra restaurant is a favorite. Rest of the hotel is sleepy with no snack options or place to watch a game without inhaling carcinogens from smoking everywhere.
One of the most beautiful hotels in Las Vegas. Spacious rooms and excellent accommodations. Really really love this place.
It was my first time staying at the Encore last December and I absolutely loved it!!!. . My room/suite was so amazing that I'm rating Encore 5 stars right off the bat. My room was beautifully decorated, spacious, and luxurious. This is definitely how I want to vacay every time! I've been to the Wynn several times but never really walked around Encore. The second that I walked in through those Encore doors I fell in love with the red decorations. I'm a photographer so the first thing that came to mind was 'photoshoot!!'. The hallways, the check-in counter, the lounge right by the elevators to the room were all aesthetically pleasing to my eye. I could've just strolled through all the pieces of art around the hotel if it wasn't congested with smoke.. . As soon as I walked into my room, I felt like I was living a dream. I suppose that is the theme of the Encore and the Wynn... to feel like we're living a dream. Our view of the strip was amazing mostly because our window to the outside was the entire wall. From my room I could see the Wynn hotel and the Encore Beach Club downstairs.. . For light sleepers, Encore rooms might be a problem because I could hear some of the music from the club downstairs the first night I stayed there. Tues night and Wed night must be break night for Vegas in terms of clubs cuz I didn't hear music playing at night on those nights.. . As for gambling, there isn't a large selection of slot but there's enough variety. I didn't play at any of tables at Encore but there seems to be a decent enough selection. If you need more to choose from, the walkway to the Wynn is pretty short. I'd say it's about a 5 min walk passing through some lovely shops.. . I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat at Encore. I only saw a lounge and a bar, which didn't attract me much for food.. . Hope my review was helpful!
I just checked in for a work function.  Despite having a confirmed reservation at the Wynn, I was given a room at the Encore.  Under the same roof?  It's a completely different hotel.  6 acres later, I'm checked in and pissed!  I really dislike Vegas to the core.  I was excited to stay at the Wynn.  Front desk person was respectfully bitchy.  Terribly disappointed with the bait and switch.
One of my new favorites compared to the Wynn. I would like to say that is definitely a superb choice to your hotel pickings if you consider the following. . pros:. - next to Surrender XS and all the young adult clubs 21-35. - beautiful decor and well lit areas for night time prowling. - free valet (but with some annoyance). - upscale and free of trashiness. - rooms are clean, room service does a great job, well designed. - staff is courteous and professional at all times. . . cons:. - DO NOT STAY IN A ROOM NEAR THE NIGHT CLUBS, they are EXTREMELY LOUD AND YOU WILL NEVER SLEEP (pool side generally). - valet is a block walk down from the main entrance. - sports book is a 2 block walk down into WYNN (WTF!). - room service can be spotty (different employees, different ideals). - $25 room service fee that should be disclosed. - don't offer free upgrades like other places do. - not very close to the strip, takes a bit of a walk to get to it. . ultimately I prefer the Wynn and will know where to stay next time, the Encore is extremely nice and will always be my second choice.
I stayed here in 2010 in the Panoramic Suite. . . The View allows you to see right down the strip and is impressive. . . The Hotel is like a dream land of decor and murals that make you feel your in an enchanted village. Stunning.. . The Encore is home of the famous XS nightclub which is a definite visit for any newbie in Vegas.. . Overall it is an expensive hotel but if your staying 16 nights in Vegas like I was, then you need the quality!
Booked the 3 bedroom duplex for a stay with coworkers. The suite is amazing! It is by far one of the best hotel rooms I've ever seen. Starting from the entrance from the lobby everyone was very attentive. . . Once up the elevator and into the room the first reaction is "wow". Two stories, 3 bedrooms, a massage room, huge living room with huge TV, pool table, in-suite elevator, and a humongous bathroom/bedroom. This is the type of room that you see in the movies and definitely a good place to invite a few friends over to enjoy.. . Be ready to pay about a few thousand dollars a night though.
The Hotel itself, the staff, the rooms and the service is very good.  However this hotel including Wynn are NOT kid friendly.  I was not able to take my son to any restaurant except the buffet.
Great hotel with wonderful decorations that has not been overrun with the cigarette smell many other Vegas hotels have been. We had a suite that overlooked the strip and one of the best views I've ever had staying in Vegas. However, I expected a little bit more for having a suite... such as the availability of hot water. Called room service and they wanted us to pay $5 for hot water... why not have a hot water pot in the room already? Also got charged full price even for being a hotel guest to use the Encore Spa when other hotels give hotel guests $5-10 off at the very least.. . This is still one of my favorite hotels however just for sheer convenience since it houses the best clubs in Vegas, such as Encore Beach Club, XS, and Surrender. When we were staying here, it felt like these clubs were in our backyard since we just had to go down the elevator before walking to the clubs.. . It is a bit difficult to get to other parts of Vegas since Encore is at the VERY end of the strip (right before you get into Old Las Vegas) so if you are planning on going anywhere else on the strip, be prepared for long walks or slow travel down Las Vegas Blvd.
The nice thing about staying at Encore is that all of the rooms are suites. Some larger than others, but still all suites. So far, I have only stayed in the Resort Suite King. The bed is extremely comfortable. The large TV rotates to face either the bed or sitting area. The sitting area with the couch and desk looks over either the strip orthe mountains, which you are able to choose upon checking in. They warn you that if you want the strip view you may hear some bass from the nightclub, but we did not hear anything. Maybe we just got back to the room too late. The bathroom is very elegant and large. There are 2 sinks, a shower and bath tub, and the toilet is in a separate enclosure. There is even a TV in there! Everything in the room was clean. . . Check-in time is stated as 3pm, but we arrived at 1:30 and were able to check in at no extra charge. The girl who checked us in was very nice and professional. They will offer you discounted room upgrades if available, and they offer suggestions for things to do within the resort. You can tell that they truly want you to have the best experience possible. . . Encore is pretty far at the end of the strip, but don't be put off by this if you like to get around all over the strip. A cab ride to the other side of the strip will only cost you about $20, or the walk to the center of the strip will be about 25 minutes. The Fashion Show Mall is a closer walk and features a ton of dining options, as well as a food court if you want to save some money. . . If you are looking to spend your stay mostly at Encore there is actually a lot to do within this resort and the Wynn, which is connected to it. For clubs you have XS (one of my favorites), Surrender, Tryst, and Encore Beach Club. Cirque du Soleil Le Reve, The Dream, is located in this resort. There are also dining and buffet options, and gambling/slots of course. The pools are always clean and maintained. Everything about this resort is upscale from the clubs, to the shopping, dining, and decor. I just wish I could stay here more often, but the price definitely reflects the elegant experience.
Clean, modern, upscale rooms.  If you're staying on a weekend and want to rest be sure to get the rooms that are not facing the pool/XS.  The music pumps until 4am.  Small gaming area that's not too smoky.  Table limits $15 and up for card games and craps.. Bar/lounge near the elevators doubles as breakfast and coffee stand in the morning.  Easy self park.
one of my favorite Vegas hotels.. . CLASSY, CLASSY....and Sexy!
