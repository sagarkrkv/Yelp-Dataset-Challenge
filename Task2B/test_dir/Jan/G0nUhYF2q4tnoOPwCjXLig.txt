I stayed here for two nights this past New Year's Eve. I wasn't expecting much but was glad to find a place on the strip that wasn't $400 a night. I think this hotel is geared more for families with the fun dungeon and tournament of kings, not to mention the exterior being a castle. The interior is very dated with old carpet and a lingering smell of cigarettes. The parking is pretty limited and the garage is kind of far from the actual hotel rooms. We got a room in Tower 2, facing the Luxor. Due to the Las Vegas heat and the direction of our window, our room feel like an oven but the air conditioning helped (although it was quite loud). The room was pretty dusty and the bathroom average, but the linens were clean and the TV had more channels than when I stayed at the Planet Hollywood. Excalibur charges a resort fee per day that includes wired internet and local/domestic calls. I don't think that I would personally stay here again, but it's a cheap hotel and you really get what you pay for.
I agreed to come with my friends to Vegas for NYE celebrations. I did not choose the hotel and was highly amused by the Yelp reviews. We stayed for 3 days. Our room was a decent size and fairly clean. The decor is rather old and boring, but its Excalibur so I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing. We stayed on a smoking floor because my friends smoke, but wow, the whole floor smelled like weed. As soon as the elevators opened, the smell was overwhelming. I opened our window in our room but the window only opened so far, which was disappointing as I would have liked the smoky scent to get out of the room. . . Excalibur itself was a blur of lights, slot machines, smoky air and a large amount of people gambling, drinking and walking to and fro. The interior and exterior are both old and tackily decorated, but it's a theme hotel.. *shrug* I didn't mind the hotel but personally, I prefer very nice things.. so I'd probably not come back.
While this hotel's inside and outside decorations are more on the tacky side, it's a decent place to stay in Vegas. Yes, the hotel is a little out of date and yes, their casino reeks of smoke, but if you're not going to really spend a lot of time in your room then who really cares? Although old, the rooms are still clean and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. Their food court isn't bad either if you're looking for something quick and they have a tram that takes you to Mandalay Bay.
Favorite spot was the pool. Okay casino.
I give it a 4 not because for the price it's a good hotel. Although the hotel is a little older by vegas standards the prices are comparable to what you should get at this price, so there are no complaints. I often also get comps here since I like to gamble at the MGM brands with my players card. . . I also really like the roulette tables here because usually minimum bet is $5 and they have many tables close to each other so you can change tables when you feel unlucky on one.
My husband & I loved the hotel! Very clean & staff is very friendly! Definitely coming back to this hotel. We also paid under $150 so it was very much worth it! :)
I had a very good experience at Excalibur.  Clean room, reasonable room service.   The casino was also well kept and most staff were friendly.  I appreciated the easy access to traveling between the Luxor, and Mandalay Bay!
Came to vegas for a short last min trip... Found out we had free comped rooms at Excalibur because for whatever reason it has always been our favorite place to gamble. . . So we check in early and there's a $20 fee... So okay. We go to our room and and I guess it's just the "standard" room. The room reminded me more of some motels I've seen and we were not impressed. Through the night we realized that the room has very thin walls and we can hear and were even waken up by people just walking through the hallway. The bed felt old and in desperate need of being replaced, not comfortable at all. And it may be a small detail but the bathroom towels were tiny! I'm 5-06 150 pounds and they were to small for me so I can only imagine how they would fit on someone a little larger? . . The staff was very friendly and helpful when needed. . . We also ended up with enough comp points to basically cover a dinner at the buffet (we were tired and didn't want to go anywhere) it was reasonably priced and was actually very good and a place I would recommend. . . Like I said before this has always been our favorite place to gamble, we just have fun in the casino doing our little $5 bets on roulette or blackjack and can sit in there for the entire day if we wanted.. . Overall I wouldn't recommend staying in the hotel, at least not the "standard" room (I think they are in the process of renovations maybe the newer rooms are better) but I do recommend coming here to gamble or eat if your staying near by.
You get what you pay for! I'm gonna try to not be completely negative about this place, but I seriously don't recommend anyone to stay here. It has gross, sticky, smelly old carpet in the hotel rooms, two tiny towels, no conditioner, no mini fridge, no nothing. It flat out sucks here. Casino is ok, everything is just out dated. . . BUT! If you're looking for a cheap crappy place to just rest your head after a long night on the strip, this will do-- just don't expect much, or anything from this place. The good news is, Bucca Di Beppo is located in this hotel, which is delicious.
I walked out and was awed. We're going to be staying at a castle?! Now I get to be the princess I always knew I was... and on my birthday!. . I would have given them another star, but I think the person who cleaned our room threw away my Starbucks cup. It was the hard plastic kind that was insulated and not just some regular cup. What am I going to bring onto the strip now?!. . We went the first weekend of January and the prices were outrageously...CHEAP! $70 for a whole weekend with 2 queen size beds?? How can you complain about that?! Overall the room was decent considering we just slept in it for the most part. My only complaint was that the air conditioner was super loud (for the day) and the blanket was too thin (for the night). Otherwise, this hotel is a little older than most and not the greatest ambiance wise, but if you were just going to sleep in it, it's very doable. It's at the end of the strip but most places are very walkable!
It was my buddy's birthday and he organized a trip to Vegas for six of us. He is the guy that LOVES dive bars, so guess where he wanted to stay? Basically a strip hotel with the lowest advertised rates = Excalibur! (MGM Property). For his package, they had a $21 per night rate. I have to admit that it was much better than I expected.. . Our cab driver probably put it best when we jokingly asked him on our way, if Excalibur was the best hotel in Vegas. His answer "Yes! 20 years ago" was probably accurate.. . Check in went pretty fast, there are some hidden fees, not familiar to me. $20 earlycheck-in fee (before 3pm), $18 per day resort fee (oh, didn't you read the small print?).. . Rooms are dated but have nice flat screen TVs, nothing too exciting.. . The bars and restaurants on-site are decent, we spent some time at Dicks Restaurant, where they specialize in rudeness as a gimmick, but wasn't that rude. The bars with video poker were good and the staff was friendly and attentive.
Went here for one night with two families on 1/16.  We were looking for a cheap, family friendly place to crash on a Thursday night.  This definitely fit the bill.  The rate was by far the cheapest and there was a reason why.  This review will not be comparing this resort to the other luxurious high-end resorts (Palazzo, Cosmo, Wynn, etc.) but will be merely describing our stay.  . Hotel/Checkin:  Iconic castle hotel really got our kids attention.  Great location next to MGM, NYNY, and Luxor.  Unfortunately, only one of the trams was working.  Valet wasn't the greatest.  They only had a few guys working so it took some time.  The first thing I noticed about the hotel was that there were tons of people pushing show tickets.  I never stopped to find out what the catch was...but there had to be one.  The line for check in was pretty long (at 3pm) so I decided to try the VIP checkin.  I was a M life member but with no status...however, the guy checked me in right away.  The hotel inside looks tattered and out dated.  The smell of smoke was everywhere.  The bellman took quite a while to bring up our bags.. Room:  One big plus was that they offered connecting rooms each with 2 beds.  YOu don't see that very often.  The rooms were in the old tower (I) but was located on the 3rd floor (very short ride to lobby).  There was no central AC.  No bath tub just shower.  Beds were decent.  But like the previous posts mentioned, felt like a motel 6 set up. No wifi in the room.  . Service:  Was decent.  I called to request the connecting rooms and they were confirmed without a problem.  Checkin at VIP area was nice.  Some negatives...You can call ahead to request your car from valet.  Fee for crib and rollaway.  . Amenities:  Nice arcade and game area for the kids.  Prices were fair (most games $0.50).  Buffet was pretty bad...see my review for it.  Did not utilize fitness or spa.. Value:  You definitely get what you pay for.  Pluses...cheap prices on rooms.  They have a big coupon book they give you on checkin.  Big thing was $20 credit for food/drinks at the lobby bar (they give you 2 drinks of your choice).  Resort fee is ridiculous ($18), you get nothing for it.  NO wifi.  Just wired internet. . . we knew what we were getting when we booked here.  So I can't really complain.  Probably would not return.
ARRIVAL.   the bus bumps you of at the back entrance of the hotel where you walk  endless streets and round many corners passing  rows of shops to get to the  check in desk .  on the way  you are confronted almost every step by a team of hustlers trying to get you to sign up for their  (no obligation) time share presentation for which you will receive tickets to one of las vegas.s many shows .. . getting to the line is no more uneventful  as they inform you check in is at 3 pm  ..its now 10 am but for a payment only  $20 you can  precheck in  and  if you dont want that  there is another army of coons willing to take care of your bags until such time as you can occupy a room and then deliver the bags to you..  just a few  clever ways to  more money from  your pocket. .  while avoiding these   offers you are still at the mercy of the * time share pushers *  who never seem to   know  when  a no means  no and continue to hassle   you  we  turned down all offers and waited out our time to check in by sitting  in a nearby bar.. . THE ROOM .  it was about average size  strange thou it didnt have  any of the mandatory  pictures attached to the walls. no safe or bar but it did have   a coffee maker in the bathroom .. it was old and needed updating the beds* two king size*  were   clean with plenty of pillows,  the shower screen was loosely  attached to the wall and the taps on the sink needed tightening  down  we found the air conditioner was noisy with no way to adjust it .. . .  FOOD .   this was the good part the resturant  sells a DAY ticket for $36 PER ADULT VIP STATUS   you can eat ANY  time as  MANY  times as you like  for this price. a good deal in vegas as most eateries in hotels  for even a light meal starts at around $15.the food was good   the service was excellant and as VIP we got to go right in and not join the end of the  line   this privilege   was one of the reasons it was  worth the day ticket alone.    so much time is wasted in las vegas   waiting in line to eat ,see a show or enter one of the many nite clubs .. . . For the price we paid it was nt a bad deal you only get what  you pay for.   just wish the hotel management would take action to stop these   little asian  guys harrassing  every new quest as soon as they walk thou the door ..    your tired after a long and stressfull flight your first thought is to get to a room, shower change clothing and hit  the strip    this continued hustling is annoying .. .  one little ass jumped right   in front of me as  i  was turning   a bend in the corridor trying to manoeure  a suitcase between  a thong of people  . .   he at lest was one who  got the message loud  and clear  with a few nasty  names  shouted loudly in his ear
Let me say I been to vegas many time and stayed all over the strip. . . I booked the hotel through a getaway package with jetblue. The price and the review made me a little worried so I booked the contemporary room.. . My plane arrived at 2 and we got to the hotel at 2:30. I got in line for check in and it was long. I swear this line was crazy. Maybe bc of the time and it was at check in time but was it long. I got to the front and ask if I can check in a little before 3 she said yes and she was very nice. Then we decided to upgrade with a view of the strip. . . . When we got into our room. It was very nice and clean and a perfect view of the strip on the 27th floor. I was very pleased. It came to be like 70 dollar a night with the resort fee and all the upgrade. Please see pic below. Everyone on the floor was supper nice. The cleaning lady and staff was on point. The only draw back for the room is the noise from the street. Even on the 27th floor out of 28 you can still hear it. So consider getting a view of the pool for noise purposes. . . . We stayed an extra night due to flight cancellations and they accommodate it. . . We got the 20 bucks early book and we used it for 2-3 drinks at the bar and got some coconut water. And just tipped like 8 bucks . . The spa was amazing. For an extra 10 bucks I used the sauna and steam room and my skin felt brand new. . I hate the timeshare people. Get a hint when I make no eye contact. . . Overall, I would stay here again in the contemporary rooms. It was a good time and it exceed my expectations. The spa would bring me back bc it was nice and quiet and I was alone.
I gave it one star because I could not give it a zero. My Wife and kids stayed their alone and they were robed in there room while they were sleeping. All of their cash was stolen. We need to get a class action against this Casino. The security only does an internal investigation? they don't call the Las Vegas PD however my wife did. You can you tube Hotel Doors and see how easy you can be violated at the hotel however the security is the worst I have ever dealt with, Disney has 1000 times better security. I am going to go after the door lock manufacturer and Excalibur. If my family woulD have been awake the situation could have been worse. DO NOT STAY AT HERE. Security does not monitor the floors and random people are placing delivery service (might be a scam) and other propaganda on room doors. When we reported the robbery the casino went into liability mode not customer service mode. If you value your life do not stay here! Please yelp me if you have a class action going on.
How many people get to stay that they've stayed in a castle? hahahha. . It was right after NYE (but just in time for my bday) and at $70 for the whole weekend - it's hard to complain!. . It's at the very end of the strip so unless you're trip consists of whatever is in this building and New York New York, you're going to have to do a little bit of walking (which luckily our group didn't mind).. . Not the prettiest and definitely not the fanciest of room, but it did it's job of providing us a place to get ready and sleep (who stays in their hotel when there in Vegas anyways?). . The sheets were a bit thin and cheap, but it did its job. There was a heater/AC for the cold winter night anyways so we were fine. Blowdryer was broken though :/. . Overall, for the price - it's a super good deal! And it provided us all the ameneties we needed for the weekend.
So we stayed here for cheer competition and my fiances first time in vegas. I was a little bummed at the service we recieved his first time in Vegas. First of all when we checked in I asked for a higher floor so he could see more of the strip but we ended up getting the 6th floor....ok whatever. Then we get in the room and I see a hole on the wall by the window...ok fine its not the best of hotels...well my last straw was the yellow stains on the bathroom carpet!!!! like really you couldnt bleach that or throw it away!!! The casino service wasnt any better either. We sat down to gamble and it took the cocktail waitress 20 min to get to us and we waited another 15 min and never got our drink...Over all not happy with this hotel.
Excalibur is one of the best values on the strip.  It's not the most beautiful or modern hotel/casino, but for the money, you just can't beat it. It's as close the the central part of the strip as you can expect for what you're paying. The rooms are just ok, and they're pretty dated so if you're looking for something high end, look elsewhere.   I haven't eaten here, but for a place to lay your head at night I highly recommend it.   Plus, how many of us enjoyed the stories of Camelot and King Arthur as kids? It's kind of like being a kid again, just for a moment.
