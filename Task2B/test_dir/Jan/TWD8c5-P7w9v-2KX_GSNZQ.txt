This review is based only on visiting the hotel for attractions, restaurants, etc. You can see my reviews for House of Blues and Shark Reef Aquarium. My biggest frustration with the hotel is the horrible signage for visitor parking. I have been to many places on the strip and this one was by far the hardest to figure out where to park at. I would think you would want to make it easy for people to visit your establishment.
Stayed here for NYE. The rooms are spacious but the furniture is outdated. They did not clean our room one day and thought nothing of it. We asked room service if we could have a knife to cut some limes with for our drinks and they wanted to charge is $4. Ridiculous. Our flight got delayed to 11pm due bad weather and the latest check out they could give us was noon saying they were at full capacity.That was a lie because the lady at the front desk offered to extend the stay by one night for $130. Yeah right. All we wanted was a late afternoon check out. The shopping is also terrible. Would never stay here again.
If I could give zero starts I would. Customer service there is far from being good. I heard so many good things about this hotel so when I saw a good deal on expedia.com for this hotel I took it right away. I had few problems with them that would make me think twice before I'll stay there again.. We checked-in fine. Problems started the next day. We went for a trip and left a "do not disturb" sign on the door. When we returned back, there were no sight outside the door and the room was cleaned. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with them cleaning my room, but it was surprising that they ignored my request. Ok that wasn't a big deal.. Second problem I encountered was when they charged me at checking-out. The deal included 2 buffets per day meaning it has been prepaid by me before I arrived.. Buffets over there are pretty expensive, so when I was charged for 2 of them at check-out I it wasn't something I was happy about. It was over $200. They said that they will resolve the issue, and I will be reimbursed. Well, I got only half not the whole amount they charged me. So, I would have to call them again and try to get the rest of the money somehow. . And the last problem that finally got me was with the lost and found department. I managed to leave some valuables in the safe of the room I stayed in. I mean I realized it was my mistake, but still expected a little more understanding from them. I called in two hours after I checked-out asking them to go to the room and take my things out of the safe. I was told that someone went right away and I will receive a call back within 30 minutes. After not hearing from them for 4 hours I called again just to hear the same story, the room is still free and someone was on the way to the room. Same I heard the next day and the next day. When I called again on the fourth day I was told that they couldn't go into the room since it was occupied that day and they would have to wait for the people from that room to leave. I was very patient all this time, but when I heard that I finally lost it and told them that I didn't appreciate them lying to me all the time when no one actually did anything. Guess what? They hanged on on me. The bottom line it took them 4 days to recover my items and only after I yelled at them, then they sent the items to me via FedEx and charged me for that of course.  . I believe it would be nice to hear some apologies from them, but I have no hope they would ever do that.
This review is only for the shark aquarium - my wife and I were in Vegas just the two of us so we were looking for some more relaxing things to do.  The price increased from some previous reviews I read, it was now $18 per adult.. . Overall we really liked this place - from the huge Komodo Dragon when you first come in to the piranha pool, sting rays, jelly fish, and tons of other varieties of fish, there is a lot to see.  The tank with all of the sharks in it is gigantic.  There are some very interesting varieties, including one which looks like it has a huge saw sticking out of it's face!  good stuff.  and one of the largest turtles I have ever seen (bigger than the ones I saw scuba diving in Maui).
I've stayed here many times, so I obviously think it's a good hotel.  I particularly like it during the summer because of the pool area (wave pool, lazy river).  The thing I didn't like about my last stay here (during Christmas) was the fact that the cafe is not open 24 hours.  They have some decent food selections but having the cafe as an option would have been helpful.  Rooms are pretty spacious; I especially like that they have double sinks (great when you share the room with others).
South end of the strip makes it hard to see the other parts of the strip but this place has it all! Beautiful rooms, Great places to eat, Lots of entertainment, Friendly Staff, Nice Bars, AWESOME POOLS!!!!! Casino is very nice with lots of options for gaming. The Shark Reef is okay, I think this is something you would bring the kids to and they would love it.  The Tram will take to you Luxor / NYNY area but if your walking be prepared to put on some miles on those shoes. I would stay here again! We loved it even if it's far away from everything else.
This is a review for the concierge service provided by Holly Magiera on the phone.. . I am traveling across the country from DC to San Francisco and naturally Vegas is a location to visit. I am not in Vegas yet, but I am trying to find a place in Vegas that allows bunnies. It's not like I can sneak in a suspicious bag of moving creatures in a place with more cameras than a Hollywood studio or a high class porno.. . Anyway, I called and asked if they take rabbits. Instead of Holly just saying no, she called and researched locations online, called to confirm their details, called neighboring hotels, called veterinary offices, and even found information from the House Rabbit Society about traveling with pets across the country and boarding pets. Despite it being a busy time at night and me not even being a guest, I never had anyone so proactive and helpful based off of a simple request. I was literally blown away with how helpful she is. Never have I had service like this ever.. . Holly set the paramount archetype of how customer service should be.  If I encountered people half as good as her I'd still be happy.
I like Mandalay Bay. The rooms are big, nice bathrooms and comfortable bed. The vibe in the hotel is a bit strange. I'm here on a conference and the casino is pretty empty. When I went up the street to Cosmopolitan, it was going off. I guess it depends on the week you're here. My only complaint, the room was kinda drafty and not enough blankets for the bed. Otherwise, I would stay here again.
Beautiful, clean hotel. Not trashy like many Las Vegas hotels tend to be. Katie in guest services was so helpful.
Just got back from spending two nights here. Go somewhere else. It's an ok hotel. As for the room, decent size for bedroom and bathroom. The bed was used and abused. Uncomfortable! View of the strip was great! The casino floor is big with many games to play. . . As for the valet now, HORRIBLE!!!!! Do yourself the favor and not valet your car here. It took them 50 min to get my car out! Completely unacceptable! I was late for a dinner because of this. I did complain about this.
Stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino on a weekend in early January.  You can really get your money's worth during the winter months.  Staff and service were friendly and helpful.  I did not think this level of service existed in Las Vegas anymore.  Big props to management for ensuring this level of service is consistently experienced at every turn throughout such a large resort.  . . . Check-in/out: (grade: A)  Minimal waiting, friendly and accomodating staff, great lobby ambiance.  What more can you ask for?  Unless you are coming at a peak time, or a completely unreasonable guest, I can't imagine one having negative experience.. . Room (grade: A-)   Overall very consistent with a 3.5/4 start hotel room.  I was placed in a 28th floor room with a pool view.  I found it to be nicely appointed overal.  It was clean, had no funny smells,  or stains.  I think the TV in the bathroom sticks out like a sore thumb, and in this day of age, is not so much of a novelty anymore.  I wish the provided tollietries were a bit more high end, and I would have otherwise  given an A grade for the room.  If you are a light sleeper, you will be able to hear the jets taking off in the mornings.  You are probably fine if you ask for a room away from the airport.. Be aware there is a resort fee.  My guess is they have to have it to normalize their hotel margins with all those casino room comps and resort credits being offered to Mlife players.  But at least they did a great job of being up front about it.  I was probably notified it three times during the booking process, twice more at check-in.   I can't imagine anyone getting all their money's worth out of the items and services offered through the resort fee.  I partook of only the wifi, and the connection speed was acceptable.  . . Food:  (grade: B+)  At the Bayside Buffet, the food was a dissapointment.  Service was great though, and we did not have to wait too long in line.  Weekend pricing was in effect.  Seafood was second tier.   Considering the regular the weekday price, the food quality is on par.   But if Mandalay needs to charge more during the weekends, there has to be more value provided to the guest.  I would have been very dissapointed if I did not have a food and beverage credit as part of my stay to offset the price.  Set your expectations higher than Sizzler, and Golden Corral, but lower than Wynn or Wicked Spoon buffets.. . Noodle Company salvaged the food grade for my stay.  Great food here.  A bit pricey though.  I think they were a little understaffed so the service was a little slow.  But an overall great experience at the Noodle Company.  . . The place is huge.  Many other things to experience at the resort.  Yes the big pool is closed during the winter.  I want to come back and experience Shark Reef and perhaps the nightlife options.
The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was the second hotel I stayed in on my trip to Las Vegas. Having left the LVH pretty content, we were really just impressed overall! The wait time for check in was considerably less, the rooms between our group (3 rooms) were all great and all had great views. We actually felt spoilt moving from the LVH to Mandalay Bay. . . In our room, my girlfriend and I had our own sink and mirror each on an elongated counter, with a small personal TV in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a separate bath and new, very clean shower cubicle. The room style and facilities were great, no problems and the room service had made it perfect. . . Unlike the LVH previously, the corridors didn't hum of smoke (in a no smoking area) and were really well decorated. The casino also didn't wreak of smoke, which quite a few do (coming from the UK, we're not really used to smoking in-doors anymore!). They actually may have sprayed some kind of almond/vanilla like scent/air freshner in the air-con?! Really pleasant.. . The 4 days we stayed at the Mandalay Bay, we really enjoyed ourselves. A really great casino & hotel, classy and host of the great 'Michael Jackson - One' show! Thumbs up all round.
This is my first time booking with Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. I was very pleased with my experience here. Costumer service is excellent. They treated me like a princess. They gave me a room with a beautiful view and in the upper floors. Very child friendly. The Shark Aquarium is great for children! Too bad the resort (swimming pools) were closed due to winter maintenance. Overall I enjoyed my stay here.
I wrote a review here before about the concierge here so we decided to stay. The staff here is so nice compared to many of the other hotels I've stayed at. The room itself was gorgeous. Marble, his & hers sinks, a huge tub, a shower, a separate room for the toilet. It was so spacey. I was initially concerned that we would hear the neighbors above or next to us, but that really wasn't the case. The only drawback of this place is that it is pretty far South on the strip but there are trams you can take for free. I'd come here again, no question.
This review is just for the casino, not for the rooms.  Mandalay Bay is one of the better-looking casinos on the strip. However, it's very different than many of the other casinos in that it's not even close to the gimmicky-ness that is proudly boasted by casinos such as Paris, The Venetian, Treasure Island, etc. Nice casino to gamble/eat/watch shows in, pretty relaxed atmosphere and not as crowded as some of the others since it's at one end of The Strip.  I like that it doesn't smell like cigarette smoke on the floors either. Friendly staff.. . If you want to visit the Shark Reef, plan in advance and don't wait for your last day in Vegas to do it, because lines can get incredibly long during prime tourist season and tickets have been sold out before.
I've stayed here a handful of times for conventions, and am always grateful for the comfy beds, quiet rooms, beautiful view, and variety of amazing restaurant choices within the hotel. . . Call the night before if you're ordering room service for breakfast. Due to this hotel being connected to a convention center, breakfast slots quickly fill up. . . Vegas tends to be very dry, so I recommend calling when you make your reservation to request a humidifier to be brought to your room. They're in high demand, and the hotel only keeps about 15 of them on hand for guests.
Stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel/casino itself is very classy, clean and wasn't as smoky as some others we visited which was nice. We stayed in a standard room and it had a separate tub and shower, double vanities,and a TV in the bathroom if your into that. The price was not bad, but don't forget to add 25 bucks a day for amenities which is crazy when its too cold to even use the pool but its Vegas so they get you coming and going. Also we had the least luck in this casino out of any we went to (I think we saw them all). the only other thing that was tough was the walk to everything else. Mandalay Bay is the very last major hotel and casino on the strip and it you don't take a taxi or bus (highly suggested) you will be tired of walking within the first day of your vacation. Overall it was a nice experience at a decent price. I would probably stay there again.
This place has some great restaurants. My girlfriend and I joked that we were over here all the time to eat even thought we were staying at another hotel on the strip. Next time we are in Vegas we will stay here for sure and save some trips. I hope the rooms are as good as the restaurants. It would be so nice to just go down stairs for some great food instead of having to drive down the strip.. If you are here be sure to check out Burger Bar and The Border Grill. We will be back here for sure.
Now this resort had that "Vegas feel" to it! It was clean and the beds were comfy! I didn't so much like the squeaky bathroom door since that was the sound I woke up to every morning, and the fact that my room was literally the last room at the endof the hall -- but hey, it was definitely worth the money!!!. . Not to mention that since I booked through a friend's travel agency, we got a free meal at the buffet PER DAY that we stayed -- woohoo! Now THAT'S great service and one amazing perk. . . I would definitely stay here again, I would just want a room with a view.
Ginormous place. Lots of choices. Friendly staff. 3 places to eat sushi.  Many choices for everything.
