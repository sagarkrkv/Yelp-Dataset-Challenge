Amazing
Pefect food.
I love their bruschetta and wine nights - it's always packed, but you can stand outside and have a bottle of wine brought to you while you wait. All of the bruschetta is amazing (that I've tried), and the atmosphere is young and fun. The only reason it gets four stars is because the music inside is really loud and difficult to talk over and the lighting is super low. No, I'm not old.
Perfect place to go hang out with a date or a group of friends. Been to both Arcadia and Postinos on Central. Brushetta is amazing and wine selection will not disappoint. Staff has been friendly at both locations as well.  Arcadia parking is a nightmare and Postinos on Central is bad but not horrible. Pricey unless you go during happy hour.
Cute little place in a very trendy area. The service and food here was awesome. The congestion with parking can be a bit of a pain, however, I did see that there was valet offered over there. I went for brunch on a weekend and there was an awesome one man band playing. I like to go visit here by myself to read a book and soak up the ambiance. I definitely recommend their soup and salad!
Ok! I have been here 100 + times and never given Postino a review! All I have to say is Postino's should be on everyone's bucket list of places to try once in your life. Everything on the menu is really good. My favorite of course is the Bruschetta board with all of them except Salmon. Nothing wrong with Salmon , I just don't care for Salmon period, but I'm sure its exquisite.  My husband I split a board with a Mediterranean Salad and Wine . All pairs well with wine or beer . Perfect place to hang out when its nice out which is almost year round.
I am a little biased as this is my favorite place for Girls Night Out dinner.  The Bruschetta is the best in Arizona and I never really stray from ordering that.  The vibe of the restaurant is very trendy in a down to earth way that you can feel comfortable spending some time eating and enjoying great wine.  I would recommend this place for a date or girls dinner.
I LOVE Postinos Arcadia! What's not to love about a beautiful, modern indoor-outdoor restaurant, with excellent paninis and bruschetta and a fabulous selection of wines by the glass?. . Reasons why I love Postinos, and you may too :). . 1) Great building with modern/chic decor - There's ample indoor and outdoor patio seating, and it's the perfect spot for lunch with the girls, or a date, or whatever! Parking can sometimes be tricky, but 9 out of 10 times, the valet guys will be there to help you (valet is free!). . 2) Butcher's Block Appetizer - $14 and well worth it and perfect to share - It's loaded with an assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini - Yum!. . 3) Bruschetta - $14 for a choice of 3 - The bruschetta is made with beautiful thick, large slices of crispy, fresh bread, and topped with all sorts of delicious toppings. My favorites are 1) the Brie, Apples and Fig Spread, 2) Prosciutto with Figs and Mascapone and 3) Salami with Pesto. . 4) The Wines! Great selection of wines ; there's something for everyone.. . 5) Happy Hour! $5 glasses of wine/beer Everyday between 11am-5pm !
Tuesday nights can't go wrong. But don't try to find a parking spot. Great place for a date!
We started with the bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. It a great deal. I don't remember which ones we got but they were good. They were not my cup of tea though. My gf wanted and ordered them. I just had a few. But I'm a really picky eater. I don't like most things. But I could tell that most ppl seemed to really like them. . . Then I ordered the 9-iron sandwich. Like I said I'm a really picky eater. I don't like a lot of stuff. It was good and I can see if u want something different and unique how it would be good. But the cheese they used was weird and kinda gross to me. It was one if those weird name funky cheeses and that is the point but just not my kind if food.
Had lunch of soup and sandwich here and it was delicious!  My co-workers had bruschetta board and charcuterie/olive board.  Both looked like something I'd like to try next visit.  I'll be back.
Everything was amazing. We got the bruschetta: you get to pick for different kinds and a panini to share. We got the iron and it is giant and delicious. More than enough food for the two of us. The wine is great. We went for happy hour $5 a glass so we just got a bottle for $20 - I'll be back!
I love this place.  I love the location.  I love the food and the wine specials.  I especially love the brochette.  Yep, its pretty great there....
Postino's is reliably delightful.  Their ambience transports you to a Santa Monica meets Tuscany setting.  I always feel younger, lighter, and sassier when I go.  Get the bruschetta with the summer salad (has pine nuts, cherry tomatoes, and feta) which isn't listed on the menu.   The new brunch dishes are great too!  Love this Arcadia gem.
I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often.
Best place in Arcadia!  $5 for 5 is a great deal where you can get any glass of wine for $5 before 5pm everyday.  Their food is delicious and it's in a cool building that used to be a post office.  Their patio is also dog friendly.  This is a great place to meet friends and day drink!
Great atmosphere and comfy outdoor patio seating. The bruschetta options were so delicious. The wine list provides a large selection of wine. The wait to be seated was a bit long but worth it. I will be back.
Arizona Golf . I have used AZ Golf Xpress for several years now to help with tee times on buddy golf trips to Arizona, California and Nevada. I cannot express how pleased I have been with them. Even when changes have occurred unexpectedly they have reacted with professionalism and flexibility.  Their rates for golf in Arizona are hard to beat. Although I have not had the need to use them for accommodations I am sure that is as outstanding with that service as their tee time services.
AWESOME Bruschetta and great wines!
Love the atmosphere. Really great for date night. Best bruschetta ever! Fig and apples bruschetta is really good and the one with dates is also good. Everything there has great distinct flavor from the next thing. Sandwiches are pretty decent size and really tasty too. Great wine selection. Only thing is that the bruschetta and the sandwiches are so crispy that sometimes the roof of my mouth gets cut, but it's totally worth it.
