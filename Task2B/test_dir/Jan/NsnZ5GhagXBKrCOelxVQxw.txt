Absolutely adored this place! We had a party of 8 and decided on the personalized chef's choice menu.  The total cost per person at the end including a bottle of saki was about $70 per person but it was so worth it.  Each plate that came out was better than the last.  I felt like we were judges on top chef.  Presentation was gorgeous and service top notch.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone planning a Vegas dinner.
Oh Sushisamba. I am having a real hard time with this review. . . First of all we made a reservation and were swiftly escorted to our table. The restaurant was dead yet we were packed into one area, on top of the other dozen couples in the restaurant. I HATE when places do that. We were literally elbow to elbow with strangers in an empty restaurant - UGH.. . Second, since we were so close to everyone else we observed first hand what awesome service they were getting. It was too bad our waiter was different (his name was Kiley I believe) and he SUCKED. Disappeared for long periods of time, took forever to take our order and bring drinks, didn't ever say when he'd be back around, didn't check on us, didn't apologize, took forever with the check. Really bad service made worse by the excellent service everyone else around us seemed to be getting.. . Third, the only redeeming thing about this place was the food. It was excellent. However, it was overpriced and the portions were really small. Normally I could overlook bad service and a weird atmosphere if the food is great but not with this place. I can say for certain that I will not be back here - especially in Vegas where good food and good service are the gold standard. Sushisamba isn't worth a second chance.
My friend and I went here for NYE dinner. Firstly the restaurant is very small, I felt like I was at a caricature In N Out Burger joint. It didn't at all feel like a nice restaurant but the prices sure were! The food was not great either, sushi very basic though they tried to make it sound like it was something special. They tried to charge us a $60 cover charge without telling us priorto our reservations. We stayed at the Venetian which enabled us to get a for 2 for 1 Caipirinha. The waiter took the order then when he brought the bill at the end he said that because it was NYE they weren't honouring it, I asked to speak to the manager where we discussed both issues. In the end she removed it from our bill. I do not recommend this place for sushi, go to the Cosmo Hotel, it's much better and so is the ambiance. Extremely disappointed given that the London and NY ones are amazing!
not bad. dumplings n tacos were good. it would be on my to go to places in sin city
After eating here for the past 5 years, sometimes multiple times per trip, last nights dinner beat them all. Recent menu changes were welcome, as well as seeing the old favorites still rockin' the menu.. . What made this trip so special though was eating dinner at the bar and having Megan take care of us. Not only was she a fantastic Bartender but she knew the menu backwards and forwards.. . This place gets busy, so don't miss an opportunity to experience the full menu at the bar and maybe Megan will make your dinner all the more special.
The service at Sushisamba was so bad that I am actually having trouble remembering the quality of the food. All I know for sure is that most of it was delicious, despite the fact that the fusion of Brazilian, Peruvian and Japanese cuisines seemed a lot more forced than I'm sure the owners envisioned.. . Anyway, the service. Our waiter was inexplicably absent for twenty to thirty minutes at a time, which is not the way a waiter at a place that thrives on small plates ought to do his job. Glasses sat empty. Plates sat bare. He didn't check on us, even when we were waiting anxiously to pay him and leave.. . Las Vegas weeds out places like Sushisamba over time. There are always young, dynamic restaurateurs that want to come in, hire an enthusiastic staff, and serve creative food. This place had the food down. But with service like the kind we had, I can't imagine a long tenure.
Love sushi. Love pan-Asian so I had high expectations. Absolutely amazing Tuna Tataki recommended by bartender.  See my pic. I would return here just to eat it again!Salmon sashimi was fresh but nothing memorable. Even at the bar the service was awful, quite prompt probably due to being there 3 pm but they got orders wrong on both sides of me, and not terribly attentive. Yes they're expensive but no more so than any similar quality restaurant. If you want good, cheap authentic Asian food you need to go off-strip to where the locals live.
I'm a sushi connoisseur . This place has a nice ambience, sake selection was very good, but food was just ok.
Delicious food, but the gem of the night was when Tanice blew us all away with her expert knowledge of the restaurant, from the art to the details of the origins of the videos on the tv. She captivated us with her stories of past videos and the controversies surrounding them. We'd go back just to hear more of her wisdom!
The food was DELICIOUS and the service was phenomenal!  The waitress, Tanice, was super friendly & highly knowledgable, when we asked about the beer and the cool art work on the wall she made great conversation and perfect recommendations on the food.  The entire table was very impressed. Wonderful resturaunt with hip edgy ambiance and super cool staff.  Loved it.
Tanice is the most knowledgeable waitress I have ever met!  She has an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu and attentive customer service!  Tanice food recommendations were excellent.  I highly recommend Sushi Samba for people visiting Vegas, especially the Ramen bowl and Steak meat platter - delicious.
Amazing service. The sushi was okay but the yellowtail taquito, although not really a taquito, was my favorite.
This place is good, but super pricey. If you come by yourself, grab a seat at the bar. However, this place is better for a small group. Grab a table and soak up the cool encironment. Sitting at the bar will put your back to the cool decor and you'll end up looking at nothing super distinguishingly fantastic. If you're traveling on your own/for business, go to a different bar. . The rolls are good, but small. This place is WAY more about the ambiance than the quality of food.
Last night my fiancee and I had tickets to a show at the Palazzo and decided to grab a bite to eat at SushiSamba. We have never eaten there, but we love sushi and Brazilian food so we figured we'd give it a try.  Wow - am i glad we did. We live in Las Vegas and eat out quite often. I have always believed that while the food in a restaurant is important, a review on food may not be that helpful.  We all have different tastes - for example, we are not big "spicy food" eaters. So someone with different tastes might not find our food review that helpful.  However, one aspect of dining i believe is extremely important, and also very helpful in a review, is the service. And, while the food was excellent (I'll get to it) the service is what really made this restaurant stand out. . . Service: Our server was Mike D and the manager that evening was Allen Holmes. The first thing i noticed was Mike's product knowledge.  He introduced himself and asked if we had been there before. Once he found out we were new to the joint, he began asking us what we liked and explaining both the food and extensive sake menus. We found out through Allen that the servers go through extensive training and try all of the food as well as most of the Sake at tastings they have each week. That way they can learn how to pair the food with different drinks. Mike suggested a number of dishes and we ended up ordering most of them. The appetizers arrived pretty quickly and as I'll describe below, some were nothing short of amazing. Upon the suggestion of Mike, my fiancee ordered the Sea Bass and I the Rib-Eye special. Both were so insanely good we just could not believe it.. . Mike was attentive and very engaging. He didn't bother us, but at the same time he made sure we were enjoying our dinner and seemed to enjoy taking a moment to get to know us. It seemed to make him happy we were having such a good time at dinner.  This is NOT something you see with most servers in Las Vegas. To add to the service, the bar manager Allen stopped by our table and and chatted with us, making sure we were having a good time. We spent some time talking with him about the restaurant - He seems to really know his business and it was impressive to hear how much he enjoys working there. . . We didn't have time for dessert since the show was about to start, but we looked at the menu and told Mike we would be back after the show.  We went back for dessert and Mike made a point to say how nice is was to be able to serve us twice in one night. Allen also came back and said hello - and brought over some Farofa (Brazilian dish that has the consistency of sand - not my favorite, but she loves it) because my Fiancee had commented that next time she wanted to try it - He remembered. What I also found was pretty amazing was that Mike had saved the bottle of water we had ordered at dinner on ice - in case we returned. Since it hadn't been finished - we didn't have to order a new bottle. WHO DOES THAT!! . . Food: As for the food, the appetizers ranged from OK to amazing.  The Tuna Tataki and sushi roll we ordered were OK. The tempura shrimp and vegetables were very good - light and crispy, not oily. The best appetizer for me was the GYOZA. I eat steamed dumplings everywhere i go if possible and these were the best i have EVER had. I wanted to order 3 more, but decided to wait for my meal. Glad I did!. My Fiancee ordered the Sea Bass. Mike said it was the most popular item on the menu.  We understand why.  The best she has ever eaten. I agreed after tasting it. The sweet sauce that comes with it was insane.  The Rib-eye special I ordered came in a covered dish - sizzling like a fajita. It was tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium rare). Rib-eye is my favorite dish and this was just different enough (yet the same) to make it one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, its a special, so I'm sure it wont be around forever.. . Lastly, when we returned for dessert we ordered the cheesecake and sundae - both were deconstructed versions of the two dishes. Very tasty - especially the caramelized popcorn they use in the sundae. I finished my meal with a nice port wine and cup of cappuccino.. . All in all it was such an unexpected treat it made a night out in Vegas spectacular.  Which is rare for 2 people who have lived here for over 14 years.
If this is a dinner on someone's else's dime then 4.5 stars. On yours? Let's go with three.. . Terrific last night in Vegas dinner- unique flavor combinations and a menu varied enough you can bring your work colleague that only eats steak (which we did.). . The drinks hit the spot and were subtle and fresh. Great selection of regional/international liquors too.. . Food was day boat fresh (or seemed so)...as Vegas is not on the water. Everything came out quickly as well. Adore the medium rare lamb and the selections of dipping sauces. Must try their rare yellowtail. Can't go wrong here if someone else is buying. FYI: super trendy images on the giant wall-to-wall tvs - everything from images of sand burials to waterfall frolicking near naked. Maybe pass on SushiSamba for a family dinner with the kiddos.
Good lunch option for Vegas! . . We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. . . The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. . . The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. . . The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.
Really enjoyed dining here. It's a unique menu and just about everything we ordered was great. I also like that they are open very late. They stay open until midnight.  They also get 4 stars because they carry my favorite oysters Kumamoto.
This was our second time here. First was last August for lunch. Last night for dinner. Totally recommend making reservations, it was busy! We ordered the chicken teriyaki with purple potato mash, so yummy. Lobster taquitos and shrimp tempura rolls were awesome.
The sushi was awesome. The Sasa handroll was great. The service on the other hand was not.
Compared to Vegas buffets this place is expensive and the amount of food you get is not alot...again, compared to what you get in Vegas. But, the quality of the food is really great. Recommend coming here with a large group and eating FAMILY STYLE. This is where you tell them how much you want to spend per person and they bring out food for you to eat and try. We had some of the following:. . Shishito Peppers: Excellent, large, flavorful peppers. I usually have them at other places and they are small. These peppers where big and So good!. Japanese Wagyu Beef Goyza - AMAZING. One order is not enough.. Peruvian Corn . The Tacos - I don't remember the name of them, but get the tacos!. All of the sushi rolls are amazing.. . EVERYTHING IN THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!
My favorite place to eat when my co workers and I are in town. Very expensive but well worth the money. they have the best chefs there.
My favorite destination on my annual trip to Las Vegas. Mari, the bartender, is awesome. So friendly and ready to suggest great stuff. I have fairly standard stuff -- spicy tuna, spicy salmon  gyoza. Always tasty. Nice selection of sake. I like to sit at the bar. A great "comfort food" place, if you love sushi. Yum!
The service was amazing - our server (Jason H) helped us navigate the Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian fusion menu with finesse!  Started with the sashimi tiradito - yellowtail was the bomb, served with a stunning jalapeno and lemongrass sauce...brilliant!  Also enjoyed the kanpachi - served with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil.  Yamato roll was very unique and yummy - tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar,  and gold leaf...Anticuchos were wonderful, recommend the sea bass.  Drinks...go with the mojitos and the cucumber martinis
I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Sushi Samba is one of our go-to spots in Vegas to get our sushi fix...Every time we go.They do sushi right with only the freshest seafood, prepared in creative and delicious ways.
