If they had a zero star option I would do it! By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas!! First we reserved a room with a king size bed two weeks in advance. When we got there they only had a queen available. The receptionist was a complete bitch!! When we got into our room it was a pull out bed coming out of the wall. The carpet was disgusting, there was hair all over in the shower and the counter top was as if someone spilled drinks all over it and was never cleaned off! We went to try and switch rooms and the supervisor  said there were no rooms available (which was a lie because my brother checked in at the same time and they offered to upgrade him to a suite or a king size bedroom for free!!!) so the supervisor said he would send someone to clean the room immediately. Two hours later we go back to the room and no one had come to clean at all!! The next day they finally let us have a different room! My whole family was staying there for the weekend and we will not ever be returning to this dumpy hotel!!
With so many choices on the strip, how does a proper review come to be? What are the determining factors of what creates a quality accomidation experience over a disappointing one? . . I think the answer has so many facets, all need to be touched upon even if only for a sentance or quicker mention.  The Room: well appointed with a refrigerator, internet ifyou pay an additional hotel fee, (free or less costly would be a welcome implimentation) a nice view of the Bellagio fountain, not enough water pressure in the modern, glass enclosed shower..  The Gaming: Great Bloody Mary's at the sports book, projectors for big screens are looking grainy, may need updating soon. Beaten up floor in the main casino, pit bosses and dealers were polished and helpful..  The Restaurants: SEA was atrocious, the breakfast joint by the escalator is worth stopping in for a meal or two. Nosh is also good for a quick breakfadt bite..   Shopping: The downstairs mall is not good for gamblers that want to get to the sports book as merchants are constantly badgering you to sell their wares.  .  Staff: Hit and miss, the "free show" lobby pitch was really getting under my skin as it was a constant in my day, everyday, multiple times a day with poor attitudes to boot..  Valet were chock full of information, bartenders lacked in personality and appearance, housekeeping was top shelf with personality and work eithic. Great location, sitting centrally in the middle of the strip, but for meals, gaming, music and an overall more visually pleasing experience, go next door to Paris. It's owned by the same corporation.
I WOULD RECORD EVERYTHING THE FRONT DESK TELLS U. Apparently none of the employees honor anything they say. At check in, the girl had told us there was no resort fee which was strange to me since I had looked on Ballys website and was ready to pay the mandatory resort fee. I made sure to ask her a couple times but trusted the girl and figured it might be a new year and things might've changed.I refrained from using the internet, the fitness center, and the phone, which is included in the resort fee. A day after checkout, we were charged the resort fee on our credit card.I was appalled since I didn't even use any of their services included in the resort fee and got an overdraft on my card which was why I wanted to use cash. I was hung up on 2 times rudely by the front desk when I called about it, when I was able to reach the supervisor, she was equally as rude and said the employee that helped me was very thorough so pretty much calling me a liar. Not to mention half of the lights were out in our room, there were questionable looking stains on carpets and walls. I especially felt uncomfortable during the night and saw shadow like figures near the windows in our room. My boyfriend thought I was crazy but after looking up the history of Ballys, it turns out this same building had burned down in 1980 that killed 87 people. I'm not a person to believe in ghosts but still am shaken up by what I saw. they participate in illegal charging give them cash deposit at check in so theycantcharge it without authorization .
The location is mid strip which I'd ideal for staying on the strip.  The room was just decent nothing horrible nothing great.. The casino has nothing special pretty below average actually.
I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip, but Bally's has been one of the worst hotels I've been in.. . - It's the oldest looking with air bubble filled wall paper and crusty chipped paint. . - They try to charge you $16 if you checkin before 4pm.. - All the other hotels always had toothpaste and other amenities, Bally's doesn't. - Furniture is from the 80's. . The regular room at Palms Place makes the Suites at Bally's look like a joke.
I do not care what people say this casino is awesome.. . $5 crap tables? Yes please. Free drinks while you place the $5 crap tables? Double yes please. . . This casino is great if you do not want to spend a crap load of money to place a couple of games of Blackjack or craps AND the casino is on the strip so you do not have to go out of your way.. . WARNING: They are doing some construction work so you have to walk a little ways to get the casino. . . Protip: place on the 6 and 8 on craps - pays out great. . Double protip: straight bet on the ace-deuce at least once - I promise it will hit :)
*Review for a 5 night stay in May 2013* Great location on the strip, friendly and efficient staff. Not one of the fancier hotels but if you're like me and just want a clean place to sleep, shower and get ready this is a great find for the price. It's also very conveniently connected to Paris should you need anything more upscale restaurant or shop-wise. I've seen bad reviews on this hotel and experienced none of that. Only con would be a somewhat long walk from the actual strip into the hotel, but nothing terrible. The pool was very plain but efficient and played good music. I had no problems getting a chair on any day we spent there. Drinks are overpriced, which is the norm for any Vegas pool. We quickly learned they don't check your bag when entering so we brought our own alcohol. Don't forget to check out the tequila bar for $2 shots, beers and margaritas! For the right price I would definitely return!
Have stayed at Ballly's many times over the years and have always been happy with the rooms and this time especially - wanted to say how extra clean and wonderful the rooms were.  The staff is fantastic from valet to bell desk to front desk and we really enjoyed our stay and wish we would have stayed our entire time at Bally's instead of making the horrible mistake of spending the last three nights at the Golden Nugget.
+ Cheap. + Clean. + Conveniently located to Paris, Bellagio, shops. . - Toilet made horrible noise when being flushed. - Old hotel vibe and smokey smell
I got a killer deal for Bally's and I figured that location was well worth the deal if anything... glad I took the deal. Very spacious room for the price and probably the best view I've ever had while staying at a Strip hotel. I wasn't a fan of the construction in the front where the people mover used to be, but overall the experience was pretty good and the location is perfect on the Strip.. . Bally's also gets high marks for their casino... clean, high and well lit ceilings, and the smoke isn't too bad compared to other Strip casinos. Also, super easy access to Paris next door via "Le" tunnel.
I can't believe this hotel is joined with the Paris hotel. The Paris hotel is way classier and Bally's is stuck in another world (like a dead-end mall in an 80s film or some stereotypical trashy and tobacco-filled Vegas). Even Frank Sinatra wouldn't have come here back in the day (if it was built at the time). I didn't even stay here and I couldn't stand the casino nor pathetic mall after 5 minutes.
Spent a weekend here earlier this month. Can't comment on the prices since my rooms were comped. Diamond check-in was quick. I was in n' out in 5min tops. I had a room in the newly renovated tower. North tower I believe? Suffice to say, I was pretty surprised how nice the room looked. Before walking into my room, I hadn't realized it was newly remodeled in October. Shared the room with a couple friends. I know one friend made use of the alarm clock/radio ipod docking station.. The casino portion. The times I've played here it's been good. Staff are friendly, courteous. Selection of games & dining spots are decent.. The weekend overall went without a hitch. The rooms aren't as big as what I'm used to at the Rio. But they definitely were nice. Would stay here again if I chose somewhere on the strip.
I was at Bally's Hotel & Casino this past October for a set of business meetings and had a mixed experience.. . I have had the opportunity to stay at most of the hotels on The Vegas Strip, and Ballys at first glance looks like a tired old man at a rave.  It was "renovated" in 1981, but it honestly looks like it hasn't been touched since it opened in 1967.. . The location itself of Bally's Hotel & Casino is fabulous.  It is mere minutes walking distance from all the new big attractions on the strip.. . The staff at the registration desk were quite nice, and apologetic for the 20 minute line I had the joyous opportunity to wait in.. . My booking was thankfully for the newly renovated Jubilee! Tower, which I was able to upgrade to a suite for a mere $20 more.  Since the hotel "convenience charge" was $16 a day, it was really only $4 a night to upgrade.. . The Jubliee! Rooms are brand new.  I mean, literally they were opened formally a few days before my arrival.  The rooms were pristine, everything was brand new, and I couldn't possibly come up with a problem if there was a gun pointed to my head.. . Some of my colleagues were not so lucky.  One in particular was originally put in the old tower and upon entering his room immediately had an allergy attack because of the mold levels.  His quick search found mold deposits throughout the bathroom from leaking pipes that appeared to be at least a year left untouched.  After calling to the front desk he was immediately upgraded to a suite in the Jubilee! Tower at no additional cost.. . I spent the majority of my time in the convention center upstairs.  I must admit, it was a welcome change to be on the top floor for meetings rather than in the basement (most hotels everywhere).  This is where the 70's was very apparent.  The long hallway to the meeting rooms was encased with large patio doors that were welded shut and clad in window coverings that reminded me of staying at my grandmother's house.  According to a staff member they had to weld the doors to the multitude of tiny patios shut due to overwhelming suicides in the 80's.  Charming.. . The decor was straight out of American Hustle.  Tired design, old carpets, fading paint, and wall sconces right out of Elvis' Graceland.  The meeting rooms themselves were no different.. . The Casino at Bally's Hotel & Casino was average.  It wasn't as updated as Aria, but it was nowhere near Eliis Island.  There are only two bars (technically 1.5) and they are extremely hard to find.  The styling of the casino floor needs an interior decorator under the age of 49, as everything has this old uncle style going on.. . The gym was decent.  If it wasn't for the fiasco of what was required for entry I wouldn't have had a problem.  I called the front desk before I departed, and they advised I only needed my key card for entry.  After walking the 15 minutes to the gym, I was advised differently and had to walk 15 minutes back to my room, only to walk 15 minutes back to the gym.  Yes, it actually is a loooong walk.  By the time I got into the gym, I had no time for a workout.. . All in all, if you arte able to get into the Jubilee! Rooms it's a cheap way to get yourself in the center of The Strip so you can enjoy yourself outside of Ballys.
We've stayed at a bunch of hotels on the strip through the years from Imperial Palace to the Monte Carlo. Bally's is more on par with IP if not worse. Where do I start? Well, you get into your room and it's the most depressing 70s looking room with their teal/blue couch. The room is spacious but nothing to look at. The mattress was so old and flat that it was probably bought in the 70s (ok, probably not but might as well) since it was not comfortable. .. . Good luck in finding an outlet to charge your cell phone. I looked near the night stand but that would have been too easy and convenient.  No luck. I kept looking and looking and finally found ONE outlet.. . If you want some nice peace and quiet, then don't bother coming here. The walls are paper thin. We heard our neighbors talking every day. Yeah, not fun. Oh, and don't forget the lovely yelling at night outside the window.  We were lucky that we were staying above the 10th floor so we didn't have to deal with construction but our friend was on the 5th floor and he got no sleep. He did get a room change and had his room comped but he looked like crap and ended up getting sick with no sleep and working. . . The casino was more annoying than entertaining. It's so small and cheesy that I wouldn't spend my money there but it's still filled with smokers so you'll be inhaling second hand smoke like being in a real casino. In summary,  there are too many other nice hotels on the strip for me to ever want to return here.
Do not stay here if you like clean, quiet place to sleep.. . Work insisted I stay here. Arrived to find out if you want to check in before 3 pm, you have to pay an additional $16.80. Before noon.. you pay $25.. . Room carpet is dirty, has loose threads, debris left from not being vacuumed properly.. . Bed throws were covered with long straight gray hair. When I called housekeeping I was told they do not replace the throws with each guest because they assume they are not used. . . Furniture blocking all electrical outlets, could not reach to plug in my electrical medical devices. They solution? Call housekeeping and we will send someone up to move furniture. No.. they would not take it from room, so it is now crowded. They offered to have someone come up to plug in things when I need it. . . Entertainment center has lots of wear and tear.. .laneer is peeling off. . Wallpaper is peeling.. Drapes are falling off of tracks.. . the only thing nice so far is the bathroom.. . Asked manager if they had newer room and was told, no. we can move to you another room, it may or may not be cleaner... you will have same issue with wall plugs.. . Next time.. I go to a different hotel. i travel to Vegas for business at least 2-3 times a year.. will NOT be back here.
