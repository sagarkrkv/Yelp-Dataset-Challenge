There is good and bad in my review. Ultimately I do not regret going here but I feel obliged to pass on the whole story.. . So we were going to be in Phoenix for a few days for my son's birthday. Bobby Q was one of the restaurants that came up as a recommended place to eat. I was told when I looked them up on Urban Spoon that if I mention them that I would get 10% off, so I figure "hey why not?" I mention it to the waitress when we arrive and when we get our bill and nothing was done. Though 7 or 8 bucks really won't make or break me, if they think coming out a few bucks ahead is worth having that advertised on a site like this then I simply think that's a foolish way to conduct business - draw people in with a deal and then back out on it. That being said I did like the food there. It wasn't the cheapest meal but it also wasn't outrageous (I think about 70-80 for my wife, son, and I). We went with the one offer that was like $40 for a couple of different types of ribs, sides, and other meat products. We were honestly quite full and agreed our health would take a major hit if we were to eat like that on a regular basis. Pretty cool decor in the place. I'd rate it higher but it does bug me with their false offers. Honour it or take it down. If you go in with that knowledge you'll probably more or less enjoy your dining experience.
Today was my first time at Bobby Qs. It was either between Lolo's Chicken Waaaangs or this place and I'm so glad I tried this first. I gave it a 5 stars because: . . (1) FOOD: it is divine and affordable! I got the briskets with mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw. It was mouth-watering, delicate and melts right in your mouth. So tasty! My friend Daniel got the pulled chicken burger with shoestring fries. He basically swallowed the who meal. My friend Lo had the sampler platter with baby back ribs, pulled chicken and bbq chicken. All were very tasty. Baby back ribs came right off the bone just the way I like it. They bring out a good portion for each so I had plenty of left over. For my briskets, mac and cheese and coleslaw,it was a $17.00 total. So I was extremely happy. At the end, you get free donut holes! Best way to end a late lunch.  PS. SHOESTRING FRIES WERE ON POINT. . . (2) SERVICE: Tiffany was my server and she was such a doll. She engaged with her customers and answered all of our questions. She made us feel very welcomed and had a sense of humor. She laughed at my jokes and played along. If there was an award for best server of the day, she would be it! And if there was a prize for that award, it should be unlimited shoestring fries for her and her customers but they are amazing!- just like Bobby Qs! . . Cheers to a BBQ restaurant and bringing in the new year right!
Simply amazing. Server was really friendly and made us feel welcome. The Q rolls were delicious and so were the ribs.
The food is AMAZING and affordable! Best BBQ in Phoenix! I come here every time I'm in town. The service is great too. Jessica went above and beyond to make our dinner enjoyable.
Great food, as always.  We are regulars.  Jessica waited on us tonight.  Nice gal, good service.
Always come to bobby qs for lunch and dinner. Their beef brisket is amazing!! The Mac n cheese is a must as a side. Best time to come in price wise is lunch. Oh and I can't forget about the complimentary sugar doughnuts!!!! Our waitress Jessica was great. She got our orders in quick and food to our table just as fast.
Been here 3 times now and tonight's server was the best communicator yet! Rishad rocks! So does all the BBQ and variety of choices. Oh yeah!
baby back ribs. mashed potatoes. mac n cheese. enough said! We bring all our visitors here. ahhhhhhmazzzingggg. Can't go wrong.
Rishad was our server and he was the best server in the whole world. He has big muscles and will knock your socks off!
I've been to many bbq places in Phoenix, and Bobby Q has had the best food by far. I try something new each time I come and I have yet to be dissapointed. But, it's not just the food that's amazing; the service is some of the best I've had as well. One server in particular, Rishad, has always been friendly and made sure that everyone at my table was taken care of.
My girlfriend and I spent $25 on sandwiches late on a Wednesday night.  It was absolutely delicious, the beef brisket and the pulled chicken both.  The manager made a point to greet us, and everything about the place was great.  It was slow and close to closing time, but they never gave the vibe that they were in 'shutdown' mode for the night, which can happen when you go to a place close to closing on a weekday.  Would strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for awesome BBQ.  The mini donuts you get on the way out were a nice surprise!  Felt like something a classy NYC place would do, very nice touch.
In Phoenix for a seminar and found Bobby's near my hotel. I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich (sans bun) and Pecan Coleslaw. Jason at the bar hooked me up with Bobby's Amber Ale and took great care of me. Though I skipped the bun on the sandwich I had to sample the complimentary corn bread...AWESOME! Make sure and try both the original and spicy sauces too.
1st time here, trying the brisket. Nice atmosphere. Vanessa has been very helpful with our questions.. Just finished, everything was great. Looking forward to next time.
Okay here we go.  Service a solid 10.  Hostess friendly and most helpful.  Service fast and again a solid 10 for Tiffany and Rashad spot on.  Manager stopped By to make sure everything was good.  Now on to to food.  Prime Rib an 8.  Smoked Prime Rib interesting.  I had the chicken.  Excellent 8.  BBQ sauce a 10.  Order the spicy.  Not to spicy.  Side of veggies the best.  Corn also worth it.  Do not miss.  Over all Vibe a 10.  The people here understand customer service.  Value 10.  Come early it gets busy.
Why write a review when this place has so many friggin' reviews that average 4.5 stars.  I will just add on to the stardom!. . I love the hog heaven, extra bbq sauce, the spicy bbq sauce, the corn bread, and the little friggin' donuts they give you when you leave.  Yes, you heard that right, little tiny deep fried goodness to make you love this place even more.. . We will see you again, Bobby Q!
Been here with my gf right before new years. Ordered a Q roll and a bbq sampler platter. The Q roll has beef brisket wrapped inside and deep fried. It tastes a little crispy on the outside and the meat is really tender on the inside served with chipotle sauce and bbq sauce for $9. The bbq sampler comes with 3 meats for $13 so we chose bbq brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs. The ribs were REALLY tender and juicy, loved them. Brisket was very tender too and the pulled pork was good. Overall, the food was really good and service was pretty decent. I would recommend this place
Philip was our waiter and he did an excellent job taking care of my wife and I. We went there for our anniversary and the food and service were excellent. Try the baby back ribs... Yum!!! Philip should be rewarded for his excellent service.
I come to the Phoenix area twice a year and this is always the first place I go to eat. A little bit more fine dining then your regular BBQ place but the food is just as good. The brisket and pulled pork are my favorites of the meats that they offer. Don't forget to get the spicy BBQ sauce. One of the best things is getting the fresh made house donuts when your leaving. The staff is pretty awesome too. Look for Nathan's section, he's one of the best.
I haven't been to Bobby-Q's in years. It was amazing. Great food! The mashed potatoes and stuffed potato were great. All of their potato products, really. Everyone was very courteous and made sure dinner went smoothly. Rishad was our server and treated us well, and on a busy night even. Thanks!
OMG, the food here is GREAT! Love their Ribs, and Brisket!  Great service! If you are wanting some BBQ food then this is a must place to go.  You will not regret, and you will come back over and over again.
This is one of my favorite BBQ places in the Phoenix area and I make it a point to visit whenever I'm in the area.  Let's face it, the #1 reason to visit any BBQ place is the food, and everything is done well here.  I especially like the Pulled Pork sandwiches and the ribs are great as well.  That being said I like the look and feel of the place as well.  Service has always been awesome and last time was no exception.  Our server, Jo, was friendly, attentive and provided great customer service.. . I'm usually here for lunch and while the place is busy it has never been too crowded or loud, making it ideal for a business lunch. It's also easy to access from the I-17 and has plenty of parking.. . What can I say, I'll definitely be back.
Were from Cali, were its hard time come by a good plate of BBQ. The food was amazing and shout out to Jessica and the amazing service that her and her team provide. If you are in the area make it a priority to stop by you will not regret it.
First experience at Bobby Q tonight and let me tell you, it was Hog Heaven!! I say that bc that was what we ordered It comes with two choices of ribs and two other sides of meat. You get a voice of three different sides as well. Best Bbq place in Phoenix by far!! Service was amazing as well. Our server Rishad was quick and attentive. Definitely coming back here again. Highly recommended it.
Food is really good and huge! Rishad was our server. Rib meat is falling off the bone!
This is my second visit to Bobby Q...the first one was several years ago. I ordered a ribeye steak and it was tender and flavorful. For $25 I got the steak and two sides and I found it to be a great value for a $25 steak. It is a step up from Outback and Texas Roadhouse, but about the same price. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. One of my sides was the mac and cheese and I can honestly say that it was some of the cheesiest, and therefore some of the best that I have had.
I'm not crazy about BBQ so my review might be slightly biased. . . I got brisket because it seemed to be the most crazed about meat. I could see why people love it but it was just decent to me. Very tender but typical BBQ flavor. . . Mac and cheese tasted like what I've had at other BBQ restaurants but a bit better. Same with the corn bread. . . I got it for take-out and they were extremely quick so that was much appreciated!
Phenomenal food. Definitely lived up to the reviews. A colleague at the office steered me here (ha!) and holy smokes (no pun intended) did Bobby's deliver! Ciara took care of us, the Q rolls gave us a taste of the brisket and wow it set the stage! The Qcolada drink was unreal, the girl loved it. Q amber ale didn't disappoint either! We had to try both the St Louis and the baby back, just to get a sample. ;) bbq chicken rounded out the meal. Shoestring potatoes were a favorite, as was the mac and cheese. I had been looking for a solid bbq place and Bobby definitely delivers the goods. Will be back.
I found this place with Yelp and thought I would give it a try. . . I was very impressed with the service. With the number of positive reviews I was afraid it may be packed so I made a reservation with open table.. . We arrived and were immediately seated. It was busy, but for lunch doesn't look like a reservation is necessary.. . Our server was amazing and I regret not getting her name. She was very attentive and I appreciated her questions. She asked if we were looking to rush in and out. It was a working lunch so we let her know we weren't in a big rush. She said she likes to ask in case we needed to be back within an hour.. . We ordered our food I went with the St. Louis ribs and the Mac and Cheese as my side.. . We had our food within 10 minutes.. . The ribs were very tender and had a great taste. We were offered extra BBQ sauce which I enjoyed the flavor.. . I was really surprised by the Mac and cheese. It was very good and my favorite part of my meal.. . We stayed at our table for an hour and forty-five minutes.. . We didn't want to be rude by taking up space, but they told us there was no rush and to enjoy our beverages and finish up our work.. . Glad I found this place.
