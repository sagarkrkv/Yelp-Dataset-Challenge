I have been coming to this spectacular place since they opened in the late 90's. Last nights visit was by far the best. We sat on the patio closest to the fountains. I still get giddy when they erupt in dance. Tammie, the wine conisoor, whom we absolutely love, recommended a beautiful Cabernet. We ate our staples. Tuna tar tar, beef carpaccio and the to die for Butternut squash Ravioli! I was in heaven. The service was top notch as well. Thank you Olives for another great visit. See you soon.

Great little restaurant in the middle of the shops at the Bellagio. The wait was about 15 mins to get a table but we decided to just sit at the bar instead. Our bartender Jonathan was awesome. Very friendly and quick. I had the Chicken Margarita Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. AMAZ-ING! The basil aioli and tomato fondue really made the sandwich! The Pear Two Martini was so so tasty too! I could barely taste the alcohol, even though I know there was plenty in there! The olive tapenades that you get are delicious. I could almost just get drinks and snack on that to be completely satisfied!
The food at this place is probably 4 stars.  The ambiance, especially being able to sit outside on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountain show, bumps it up to a 5. . . The fig and prosciutto flat bread is excellent as is the bread they bring to your table.  The octopus was disappointing -- a bit rubbery.  The pasta dishes are solid but not anything to write home about.  The mac and cheese also was just ok.  . . This is a good place to grab a drink before dinner.  If you go early -- around 5pm, you can walk in without a reservation and get a table on the patio so you can watch the fountain show.  Order some drinks and the fig and prosciutto flat bread, and you've got a great time right there.  That is a 5 star experience.
Went here for a celebratory dinner while in Vegas. There are a lot of great tables, and a couple crappy ones. We fortunately got a good one, but I could see how someone could be upset if they got seated basically facing the mall, for what you're paying in food. . . The food itself was very good. The Beef Carpaccio my dad got as an appetizer and boy was he surprised. It's basically a full meal in itself. If you aren't splitting it with at least another person, you're crazy. It's like saying I'm going to have the nachos platter as an appetizer. Look at the pictures; it's huge. That being said it's one of the most dynamic and interesting dishes we had that night, and sticks in my memory months later writing this review. . . I had the scallops for dinner, which had some interesting sea beans which made for a deep, briny flavor. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed them. . . So ya, if you can, ask for a table outside or at least away from the mall side. If you're looking for a cheaper meal, go with the flatbread. More reasonable (half price) compared to a full entree, you'll leave full, and the people around us seemed to be enjoying them.
Took my gf here for our anniversary.. . Sat out in the balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains.. It was during the winter but the heat lamps kept us warm so that wasn't a problem.. . Very romantic setting and one of the best places to see the Bellagio fountain show.. . Food was good (pricy too) and the server was very friendly.. . Good to take friends (who won lots of $$ at the casinos), date, coworkers (on company expense), and customers (on customer's company expense?!)
This is one of the better restaurants in Vegas!!! Service/Food excellent!!!  Outdoor seating of the water show Amazing!! We always make this a regular dinner stop on our Vegas trips!!! You will never be disappointed!
The only thing great about this establishment was the bread and olive tapenade you're served when first seated.  We had to return our lobster mac & cheese because the chef had burnt the cream and the free ranged roasted chicken I ordered was bland and dry.  Won't be going back.
This place is a lot like a number of fine dining experiences.  Great food, interesting menu, good ambience.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  Unfortunately, like a lot of other fine dining exeperiences you're finished pretty quickly. Start to finish couldn't have been more than an hour.  It's not like they were pushing us out the door, but things moved very quickly.  It was just the two of us, and only one was drinking, and the total was @$200.  Again, the meal was very good, but for $200 it would have been nicer if the pace was more relaxed.
This place was such a treat.. . Came in for a late lunch with my sister and was able to get a table on the patio overlooking the beautiful fountains. Tried a couple items, and everything tasted absolutely splendid. The bread basket was a great start. Then had:. . Tuna Carpaccio - delicious.. Grilled Squid and Octopus - great combination of ingredients and flavor. . Portobello Flatbread. Scallops and Prosciutto - amazing flavor. the sauce is very complimentary. risotto made perfectly. PEI Mussels - perfect. . I don't think there is anything on this menu that would disappoint me. Everything is prepared perfectly from the fresh ingredient combination, to the medley of flavors and the beautiful presentation. And of course to top it off, a great server.. . For dessert though, we ordered the apple cinnamon thing, which was like a cinnamon roll (don't care for it at all). But the other dessert was some type of pb&j mousse cake, which was amazing and different from the traditional cakes and pastries.. . Might be a bit pricey, but sometimes we have to treat ourselves :)
Got lucky and got a table by the fountains on New Years weekend the view of the fountains is spectacular and the food is amazing.  I was buying with house money I won at craps so I treated myself to a nice 3 course meal.  Very impressive place with quality food and service.
Had been here before with better experiences, hopefully this was just a one-time fiasco. Hostess friendly, sat us outside, watched fountains, all good so far. Waiter during entire stay acted like he didn't have the time to wait for us to answer silly questions like what we would like to eat. Then, warning, the nice outdoors area becomes a lot less nice when everybody starts lighting up as for whatever atmospheric and architectural reasons that would explain this, smoke just stays in the little cove of the tables instead of dissipating. My meal tasted good, but it gave me food poisoning :(. . Update: General manager tracked me down and she seemed genuinely concerned about the shortcomings of that night, so a refreshing plus for that.
The Gnocchi and Ocotopus Salad were some of the best I've ever had! The view of the fountains was amazing. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas!
The view on the outside was absolutely amazing . Got to watch the water show 4 times and it was beautiful the food was also amazing . The service was top notch. Shoutout to Argon for being such an awesome server!. When coming here it's probably best to reserve a table on the outside so you can enjoy the water show when it comes on and just enjoy the view, I don't know why anyone would want to eat indoors.
I really liked the table out on the balcony overlooking the fountain.  The server was excellent. Food was mediocre at best with Vegas level prices of course. Also it was a little slow coming out but I don't mind a leisurely meal;   Better than rushing me though like its Disney or something.
Inspired cooking in Vegas remains the exception, not the rule.   So lets just acknowledge that Todd English's Olive stands out in Vegas.  Yes tucked away in Bellagio's mini-mall-GASP.....but also a spacious patio that sits on top of the stunning dancing water fountain Duhhhhh....  Who wouldn't  want to enjoy life here.  For food lovers and cocktail goers this is for you.  Mediterranean cuisine that is skinny jean approved.  Best Negroni served at the bar.
Being a local, I know that restaurants on the Strip are overpriced to begin with. However, I expect the extra cost to be made up in food quality and service. My wife had a lamb chop and me, a sirloin steak. Both were $40+ entrees. They were good, but I expected more, like great. I also had a bowl of potato soup, $16, that was delicious but done after 5 spoonfuls. Our server was outstanding. A view of the fountains is special, but means more to the tourist crowd. We had tried to get into Prime Steakhouse, but the wait was more than 2 hours.
The food at Olives is not as good as you'd expect for the price tag, but it receives 3 stars from me for the extras.. . First, the bread basket is totally yummy. There's a variety of breads to keep you happy while you wait for your meal, and each one was good. Second, the atmosphere is quite nice. It's upscale-ish without falling all over itself. Third, we were given a stellar table for a reservation made 2 hours in advance, for 12 people, on a busy Saturday night.. . The food is oversalted and under-tasty. We were all happy enough with our meals, as it tasted good, but nothing about it made us feel like food is the focus at Olives. I think they are banking on the location inside Bellagio and the atmosphere to be the draw, and serving good-but-not-great food.

Amazing view, food and service.  The only draw back were the tables were quite close to one another.  The table behind us kept hitting our chairs as we were eating.  For the price point, I would have expected a bit more comfort.
This is my absolute to-go everytime I'm in Vegas. I don't ever eat but their cocktails are bomb. You're gonna pay $15/cocktail on the strip but these drinks are totally worth it. 6 oz. and delicious!!
When you're in Vegas on the strip and are craving a nice Italian dinner, I highly recommend Todd English'sOlive at the Bellagio. Excellent pasta , great customer service, and a prime view of the famous Bellagio water show.. . Enjoyed with my family were the following:. . - Onion Foccacia (complimentary in your bread basket): perfect tenderness and flavor pact.. . - Gnocchi ($32): Did I mention best ever? No? Because I'm not kidding. I've had some good gnocchi in San Francisco and even Florence, Italy - but this plate in particular hit all the right notes in regards to texture and flavor composition. Delicate pillow-y soft gnocchi layered in a beautiful light tomato coulis with pulled chicken, goat cheese, kalamata olives, and toasted pistachios...this is the kind of dish that I'd love to enjoy again and again and again.. . - Fettucini Carbonara ($37): ordered this dish bc I've adored a similarly constructed dish at Haven in Oakland. Crab, pancetta, and egg yolks emulsfied in a cream sauce - all the good guilty things in life - how can you go wrong? As a result, the dish was indeed flavorful and the pasta tenderly al-dente, but just a bit too salty for my palate. Overall, very enjoyable, but Chef Kim Alter's version (Smoked Pasta) still remains my #1.. . - Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread ($19). Good, but slightly dissapointed. Prosciutto and figs are such a natural flavor combo that you wonder how on earth can you screw this one up? For some sad reason the figs were so overcooked they tasted like prunes. Or, did someone make a horrible decision to use dried figs...and not fresh figs? Regardless, this was the only dish which we had leftovers of.. . - Pomegranite Souffle ($14): Though light and custardy as any good souffle and presented elegantly, the pomegranite flavor is no where to be found. It might've been covered up by the creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream.. . All in all, though the prices are a bit on the heftier side for the cuisine, you pay for the view - and the delicious pastas!
The wifey and I had a great lunch on the patio overlooking the Bellagio lake.  We started with (and recommend getting) the fig and prosciutto flat bread.  It's heavy on figs, but you can toss those to the side.  After that I enjoyed my steak sandwich.  Can't go wrong here for a casual lunch.  Service was great too.
