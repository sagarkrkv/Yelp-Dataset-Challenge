This review is based on staying at the hotel all of 5 hours... we checked in around 1am (which is a surprisingly popular time to do so!) and checked out at 6am for a tour we were taking. . . Granted this was a weekday and we had the world's shortest stay, but we definitely appreciated the free upgrade (no prior stayings and a booking from Expedia) to a nice "romance suite" with a built in hot tub. . . Service was friendly as well. -1 star for managing to have a 20 minute check-in queue at 1am on a non-holiday weekday.
I have stayed here a few times before, but many years ago. It has steadily gone downhill.  They now charge the much-hated "Resort Fee", which is a sleazy way of hiding the true cost of your stay. They also charge for internet access. VERY slow internet access. According to Cox Comm they have very old equipment at the Stratosphere and do not want to pay for the upgrade.  A 25 year old analog TV has a better picture than the TV in my room. I got my revenge by doing ALL my gambling and eating elsewhere. So the $27/day charges for Resort Fees and internet access was all they got. The other big downside is that all the action happens further down the strip and cab fares in Las Vegas are outrageous.
This is exactly as it is advertised; a 3-star hotel. We stayed here off of Hotwire's Hot Rate hotel deals. We got one weekend night for like $40, but they charged an additional $17 for a resort fee when we got there, plus a $30 late checkout fee (since we decided to go hiking and wanted enough time to shower when we came back). Late checkout is at 3pm, but standard checkout I believe is at 11. . . The room itself was old; definitely outdated and doesn't belong on the Strip! I would imagine this kind of hotel would be on the outskirts of the Strip, but if they want people to return, they need to do room updates, stat. The room wasn't dirty per-se, but it was definitely old and used, so it gave the feeling of being dirty anyway. . . The staff at check in was pretty friendly and helpful with the check in and check out process. . . The only good thing I would say is that your hotel card key lets you go up to the top, which I think costs $18/each if you're not staying at the hotel. If you're traveling with multiple people, consider it a discount on what you paid for your stay. So in total, we paid about $87 for the hotel room, but we got $54 worth of credit to be able to go to the top, which makes it worth it... right?
One of the biggest problems with this hotel is that they charge extras for things I call essential. The fact they charge a mandatory "resort fee" to your room is criminal, just put the room rate at its correct level. They charge a lot for wifi, which most other hotels I use give for free. The restaurants I used were mediocre. The hotel rooms are a little tired, from the pictures it seems they have renovated some rooms but mine had clearly not been done.. . Won't be here again.
Been here twice. Spent week here after Christmas and fun was had.. . Room in the 19th floor and we had a great view.. . Tables had great dealer. Pitmen were fun and ensured everything ran smoothly. There were a few folk begging for money...be careful near the joker poker. . . Bar in playing area had drinks at decent price. Shouldn't need to pay for drinks..just play a game or two. Hookers hang out there. I was asked twice if interested...I mentioned to management. Nothing to my knowledge happened.. . Sports book is small...this is a place for hanging out. If you want to pay more and get the full vegas experience go to a casino closer to strip.. . $20 cab rides mount up...tell cabs you want to go via the strip...don't let them use te highway.
Pretty lame. It's far away from the strip and outdated. No cool shops and no good places to eat, but if you're into thrill rides and a cool view, you should check it out.
As a Vegas local, visiting the Stratosphere was on my list of things "to do later...."  I'm not a huge fan of the Strip, mainly because I'm impatient and waiting for the numerous lights to change whilst driving does a number on my blood pressure.  Anyway....a friend and I took advantage of the January locals' deal (free tower entry with NV ID on weekends) and decided to check out the top of the Strat, which apparently is the tallest freestanding observation tower in the US.  The view is good but I would not have paid $18 to experience it.  However, during our time on the observation floor, we got to witness a brave lady throw herself off of the tower (Skyjump controlled free fall; it's $109.99 per jump), after which we did not see her again....I'm sure she's fine....we also got to see the other rides in motion and hear screams of delight, I think...!  One can purchase ride packages, buy solo ride tickets, or just live vicariously through others' ride experience.  Glad I went up the tower and more glad that I didn't have to pay any $ to do it!
The hotel is dark and dumpy while the food and drink options are slim pickings, but that isn't really why anyone goes here - is it?  Free January trips to the top for locals is pretty much all you need to know and with excellent views and a light crowd I'd recommend everyone do it at least once - touristy for sure, but far cheaper (and taller, and less of a hassle) than the Seattle Space Needle or the St. Louis Arch.
We had a rough start here but boy did they make up for it!!!!  We go there on Wednesday and the room was not at ALL as they described!!!!  It was tiny, didn't even have luggage racks and the smallest most ridiculous closet.  Well when we complained we were instantly upgraded to a suite!!  A SUITE????  AYFKM???  Oh yeah now this was LIVING...with the exception of us having to go BACK downstairs with all of our luggage to sign off on the changes and no bellman was sent for assistance or for our inconvenience!!!  I will say however once we got into the suite it was DELUXE!!!  Whirlpool tub, super comfortable bed, great view, clean and totally what we thought our original room was going to be.  The Starbucks here is a little disappointing...they don't have a microwave to heat up a croissant?!?!?!?  That was either the worst customer service EVER or the dumbest decision ever!  I mean we are in freakin VEGAS staying up all night and then trying to function in the morning of course we want coffee and we might be a little edgy, but it isn't too much to ask to warm up a muffin or whatever you get with your coffee.  I definitely recommend the SkyJump!  It is AMAZING and so worth the money!  Overall our experience here was top notch.  But the rooms aren't the best unless you are staying in the suites!!!  Call me spoiled!!!  I would have survived in the regular rooms however it is vacation...you are supposed to be LIVING not surviving!!!
You get a nice view from atop this sketchy Vegas icon.  The observation deck is high above the casino and hotel below and allow you to see the entire city.  The outdoor deck give you an  up close look at the rides that nearly defy logic.  It seems strange to install an amusement park on top of a tower as they did but it works.  People get their thrills up there every day (weather permitting).  I've only ever done the Sky Jump myself.  The other rides just aren't my style.  When I go up in the Stratospher Tower it is almost solely for the view.  There are a few problems with it though.  Admission is $18.  $12 for locals.  All you get for that is a ride in an elevator.  Sure, it runs at 21 MPH and takes you up the core in less than a minute but the simple fact remains that it is nothing more than an elevator.  Second problem, trying to figure out where to purchase admission.  I was there on Friday taking advantage of the January special for locals (free admission Fri, Sat, Sun all January long).  I stood in one line near the entrance to the elevators.  They told me to go to the box office.  I went to the box office and it was dark.  Security told me to go down stairs to the other box office on the casino level.  Then I had to go all the way back to where I started and stand in line for a while as each elevator can only take 10 people.  When you have a long line 10 people at a time makes for slow progress.  Neverthless, the wait is worth it when you reach the top and see the magnificence of the Las Vegas Valley.. . As for the casino, not bad.  It is big and mostly modern looking.  Its fairly clean and doesn't seem to smell too strongly of smoke like some casinos do.  My favorite part though is near the casino level box office mentioned above.  There is a nice Dale Earnhardt Sr. Chevrolet Camaro and the Stratosphere Pole Award given to the pole sitter of the Kobalt Tools 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway every March.  As a NASCAR fan, this is pretty cool.
This was my first time to Vegas and my first time at this hotel and it was a bad experience. This hotel is on the opposite side of "fun", it's in the "ghetto" area! Right when we walked into the hotel they try to get you to sign up for this 2.5 hour tour to take you and show you their other hotels that they just opened - which sure they offer you a free stay at any of their resorts for doing this tour but seriously who wants to be bribed right when they walk in? We did put our names down with a $20 refundable deposit just in case we did want to do this, but in the end we wanted a refund - which took them 30 minutes to even find our name on their list and we had to come back 2 hours later to get our $20 back and they STILL tried to sell us ANOTHER deal - VERY disorganized and annoying! We were able to check in 4 hours before our check in time, which was very nice and for a VERY reasonable price, but we had to ask the front desk ourselves -  NO ONE told us we were able to do that, everyone acted like that wasn't even possible. The room was OK, I've gotten cheaper hotels that at least had a microwave and fridge in it. Unfortunately, within the first 30 minutes of settling into our room my fiance and I were trying to rest and a lady seriously knocked on our door TWICE and RIGHT AFTER she walked in!!! The pool was nice, but the Jacuzzi was dirty. I was not able to check out the rides- the lines for the ride were super long!If anything good came out of this experience it was the floor with the food and shopping area, it was pretty nice- the Mexican food place was on point; VERY fresh and yummy with a for sure reasonable price! I would NOT come back here again.
Let me preface my review by stating we requested and paid additional for an updated room because we heard the older ones were pretty dumpy. The updated room was great. Very clean, pretty view and the staff was fine. The hotel is far from everything which sucks because the money you're saving by staying there you make up by taking cabs. By being a guest it gives you free access to the top which is cool. The view is great. Again, the 107th floor bar is ridiculously over priced, but that's Vegas. The casino is pretty boring, and so are the casino bars. If I could do it over, I'd stay somewhere closer, but overall not a horrible hotel.
I give it 2 stars just due to the fact that it's older vegas! Other than that...the service,organization and just appeal is horrid!  I'm waiting for this to be the next addition to the neon boneyard! I will take my kids to watch this travesty imploded in the near future. The ghetto fabulous side of vegas exists closer than you think.
My brother gets a great deal because he has a players card from here. For $30/day it was cheap enough for my lean pockets. We get adjoining rooms on the 19th floor, non-smoking. The rooms were clean enough, although I could still smell the cigarette smoke wafting from the elevators just a few steps away. It's one of my pet peeves of hotels with casinos, you can never get the smell of cigarettes out. Plus you have to go through the casino to get to the hotel anyways so there's really no escaping that. Anyhoo this time we get the room with a view of the mountains and old town Vegas. It was cool too, but last time we were here we had a view of the strip. That was super nice. . . With the room key you get a free pass to the observation deck ($18 value) and with the players card you get 10% off at the buffet and Roxy's diner. I'm not sure if they offer it at the Italian restaurant. They have Top of The World restaurant here (reviewed separate on its business site).. . The restrooms are clean and maintained well, frequently stocked with supplies. . . Parking is adequate but if you're like me I love to park on the 3rd floor, coz that's where the bridge to the casino is. I don't mind driving around and around until I get one close by =P.
