LOVED this show. Including KA, I've seen two other Cirque Du Soleil shows - Amaluna and OVO. Hands down, KA is my favorite. There was a recent accident in which a performer died in the final battle scene, so that was replaced by a video that is blurry and confusing. HOWEVER, I have to say everything else was phenomenal! . . The theater itself is literally breathtaking. When I walked in, I was just overwhelmed with how beautiful it is. The mechanics of the stage is incredible - rotating, spinning, etc. Just incredible. . . I was lucky enough to sit in the center, front middle. I like this more than sitting in the front because I can see the performers running around through the crowd and next to me. This spot is also great since you can get a full 180 view of the show without needing to twist your neck around.. . The performance had a great storyline where two royal twins - a male and female - who were separated when the antagonist attacked and how they find their way back together as they come to age, with the help of some allies. It's cheesy, but I still adore it. They have beautiful music and the acrobats just blew me away. I think because of the accident, my review may be different in the fact that this performance was more theatrical than acrobatic. People complain about the finger shadow show but if you are following the storyline, IT MAKES SENSE PEOPLE. Thekid, a prince, and his protector are lost in the woods, alone, with just a lantern. In order to calm the young prince down, they do an adorable finger show. . . I definitely spent majority of the show pointing, poking my friends, and whispering, "oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!" Only Cirque Du Soleil can make me do that. . . I'll never take stars off because there is no way in hell anyone can do a performance like Cirque Du Soleil can, regardless of the CGI or no storyline or anything. BRILLIANT.. . TIP: BUY TICKETS ONLINE!
BEST SHOW EVER!!. . My husband and i were totally amazed by the performance - the performers, music, storyline, and last but not least, the stage, WOW, it was so brilliant. I am an inpatient person, but i was 100% focus during the show, it amazed me every second.. . We initially was going for the BELIEVE, but read bad reviews about it. And my husband picked this one instead of us spending more time on gambling before we leave the sin city. And i gave him full credit for that, best show for sure!. . If i go back there again, i want to watch KA again!!
Beautiful set and theater, engaging story line, wonderful music, visually stunning, and amazing acrobatics! I absolutely love this show. My boyfriend and I snagged a pair of tickets about 20 minutes before showtime on the far right side of the theater, second to last row. Surprisingly, the seats were still great! We had a completely unobstructed view of the stage and although we were all the way in the back, I had no desire to be seated closer. There is not a bad seat in the house. Everyone was super friendly, from the lady selling tickets, to the bartender, to the ushers, to the dude selling programs. We had an awesome night; the show left us in awe. Ka is a must!
Ka - BLAH!!!. . 2 stars for the theater, sets, athletic effort of the performers.. . underwhelming in every other way....I would skip this Cirque show and see any other one is the short review (I've seen O and Zumanity which were amazing). . You walk into a visually stunning theater with platforms all around, fire-balls coming up from beneath the stage and speakers in the seats....it looks very promising but completely falls flat.   They need to go back to the drawing board with the final battle scene (it!s a 10 minute blurry video...yes...a video of little avatars....at a Cirque show!!). . If you've never seen a Cirque show maybe you would enjoy it....didn't do it for myself and the orhers in the group.  Kind of a rip off.
Went with my girlfriend in August and loved it! This was right after that performer had died during the show so we saw the new ending and while the rest of the show was great this new ended was lacking and left me wanting more - hence the one star deduction. I know it was a bit on the fly for them since it was so soon after but if you're going to keep the show going then have it be on point. . . As a whole though this was really great. Costumes, the staging, the action. Everything was well done and so creative. Definitely one of the better Vegas shows to check out so do it!
KA provided an alright experience, however I wouldnt go again. This is definitely a one stop shop. The set up is very promising but when when it comes to the substance of the performance it didnt deliver. Some scenes were phenomenal whilst other were somewhat disappointing.  For instance, the vertical fight scene is now "televised". A prerecorded scene is projected onto the platform as opposed to it being acted out. I understand that's scene where the most recent the tragedy took place, but c'mon remove it altogether instead of half-assing it.
I don't know if it was food coma from having dinner at Tom Colicchio's OR this show was really BORING I was falling asleep! I couldn't wait for the show to end! I could watch performances like that at the LA COUNTY FAIR! For FREE! This was a total waste of Time & $$$!! Even if I was offered free tickets to this show I would not waste another 90minutes of my life watching KA. The whole 3 min video towards the end was lame! Come on we're paying $ for this and you're going to show us VIDEOS?? Why not just change it? It wasn't even a good video it was blurry & I couldn't understand what was going on. Lame performances. The stage was cool but that's about it oh yeah and the whole slave cage thing. Everything else put me to sleep. ZzzZZzz! I didn't even clap my hands. That's how bad it was. The stages seem to do a lot more than the actual "Cirque Du Soleil" performances. Go spend your money at Wynn's Le Reve instead! You won't be disappointed.
I have been to several cirque du solel shows including totem, O, zumanity, zarkana, ovo, lreve and mystery. This one is a little different than the rest. It has less acrobatics and more theater, but the theater part is enjoyable and interesting. Custom design is excellent.. . I give it a 3 because I like to see more acrobatics when I go to a cirque and this one did not deliver enough.. . The music was good and the seats had build in speakers!
I'm a big Cirque fan, but this one left me a little flat. Prefer the only other two Vegas Cirque's I've seen to this one (Mystere and Beatles LOVE.). . The "floating" stage was a pretty cool element, but overall the whole thing was more "showy" than traditional Cirque-acrobatic. . . Plus, they should really work out an alternative "live scene" to replace the one where the tragedy took place last summer, if they feel it's unsafe to perform. The CGI version of that fight scene at the end was a big disappointment - especially for keeping the show at full price. . . I felt let down at the end.
I was expecting my mind to be blown after reading reviews and being told of how awesome other Cirque Du Soleil shows are.. . Unfortunately Ka put me to sleep.  I could barely keep my eyes open halfway through the show.  . . The CGI near the end is terrible.  I had no clue who was who because it was so blurry.. . Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  Sorely disappointed I dropped almost $300 in two tickets for this show.
Hands down the best Cirque in Vegas!! Seen in multiple times now and it only makes me want to see it again and again. . . The stage sets and costumes are INCREDIBLE. The acrobatics are jaw dropping. And unlike some of the other Cirques I've seen, the plot is easily followed and engaging. This show leaves me speechless and nearly in tears every time. . . They keep it on the low side as far as the jokey Cirque aspect is concerned, which I appreciate because I can go see this at a cheap Vegas comedy show. . . I'm going to keep this one short and let ya'll see for yourself!
Very impressed with the acrobatic moves, music, rotating and vertical stage.  The water wave & under the sea, costumes and flying scenes.  Definitely worth seeing.
Having heard so much about Cirque de Soleil and Ka I have to say I was looking forward to seeing it. Wow, was I disappointed.. . I went with a tight group of coworkers after a nice dinner, everything was set for a great show to cap off a good night. Didn't happen. The theater is massive which means that we blew massive amounts for tickets $300+ easily and were still quite far from the stage and not even in the center section (tho our seats were on the aisle bordering the center section). I can't imagine how much people farther up/center section paid. What a waste. The theater is just too large, too grand.. . The acrobatics/gymnastics/etc were impressive, but you know, and can at many times, see the wires supporting everyone allowing them to perform the feats. Sure takes a lot away from the performance. My favorite part of the performance was a scene when there were a few men atop/inside rotating wheels - imagine massive revolving hamster wheels with men jumping from inside to outside the wheel while the wheels rotated in a circle - this was incredible. But the rest of the performance just seemed either gimmicky or simple.. . Ka also claims to have a plot. This is a ridiculous claim, I couldn't follow the plot whatsoever. There was some guy who was trying to save some girl I think, but it made no sense and was totally disjointed. Almost as if every now and then the writers thought, oh right, we have that plot thing we have to reference.. . Save your money and don't waste your time. Vegas has soooo many other vastly superior options, do something else.
Went to the dress rehearsal performance tonight. Spent $70 for my husband and I.  The entire show up until the end was awesome.. . . I realize just a half a year ago Ka lost a performer during the final fight scene.  I understand their reasoning for not doing the same ending since then, however, they need to do SOMETHING. The ending was TERRIBLE.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.. . I'd be sorely disappointed to pay $104 a piece for the seats I had tonight to see a recorded and grainy version of the final battle. Cirque needs to rethink their ending.  I realize the set up is ridiculously steep and obviously unsafe but I personally can think of a few ways to do something with the ending other than the little filmstrip they play.
I wasnt impressed. Hardly any acrobatics. Mostly theater performances. What bugged me most was the fact that they intentionally spent way too much time in useless scenes to accommodate the backgrounds which the used for less than 5 mins. Then they use a VIDEO recording of what would have been the most impressive scene. I felt cheated. Avoid if possible.
I'm a local and took cousins from Iowa to see first show of 2014 season.  As circ shows go I was very disappointed.  For the price of tickets ( I'm glad I bought at local discount rate), our seats should have come with binoculars .  Not worth going to see.  One hour into show and I'm still waiting for a "wow" moment.  Should have seen "O"
Best show in Vegas. So many show to pick when u r in Vegas but u have to see KA show when u r in Vegas. I saw 2 times ! So amazing show !
