My mother REALLY wanted to try this place out when we came to Vegas, despite my arguing against it. There were tons of people waiting for a table, both in the restaurant and outside, so she kept saying "Well it has to be good since there's so many people here !!" How I wished that was true.. The wait wasn't too bad. 10~15 minutes.. I got the calamari, and it sucked. Hated it.. We ordered some beef entree and they didn't give it to us until near the end of the meal. Even after several reminders. Idk how the rest of the food was because I was too busy trying to eat the horrible calamari.. My water was only refilled once. 20 minutes after it's been sitting at the edge of the table completely empty. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it is to me. I mean, I would have asked for a refill myself if I could flag someone down but noo they were all running around serving other tables, and being apparently much too busy to attend to our one table.
I base my reviews on the food, service, and atmosphere. Given that, this place was pretty average for a pho place. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and large in size. It 's fairly busy every time I've drove passed it. I ordered my usual beef broth with rare flank steak. The broth was in my opinion, very tasty. I didn't need to add too much extra sauces like usual. The prices are a little bit more than I'm use to for the portion, but not too bad. So if you're looking for a good pho spot in Chinatown, Pho Kim Long is a safe bet.
Pho Kim long. Fun e nam! Don't you think? Well if your a local or party with locals chances are you will probably end up here after a night out for some drunk munchies or after a wicked hangover sets in and your in dire need of liquids containing pho noodles.  The food good. The atmosphere is questionable. If you come here sober you'll probably run into someone you know who is plastered. Fun? Maybe. Enjoyable? That depends if you get anything good to use on them! Jk, sorta. . Seriously though the food is good. Order something other than the pho you'll be surprised it's pretty damn good! I like the crab Rangoon and the peppered beef. . Ooo and the Thai boba is yummy! Don't get the fruit flavored ones they use the artificial fruit stuff. . The seating sucks and the bathroom is not so clean. If you like lots of ppl, a noisy restaurant, and pretty decent food than give pho Kim long a try. What could it hurt. I've def done worse drunk.
Open late for drunk feasting!  Each time I have gone, there was a wait, but it's not too bad. I have ordered the dat biet pho and the chicken pho.  They were both good.  Egg rolls were typical.
What! Only 3 1/2 stars?! This place has quality food! Whether you order their amazing pho (I ordered the #10)b or their delicious Kung pao beef, you can't go wrong! Their egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had.
Good lunch spot, although it took some time to get our servers attention. We both ordered Pho and it was delicious. Mine (with various meats) and his (chicken) came out very quickly and had nice flavor. We were seated at a giant round table even though it was just the two of us and our 1 year old. They child seemed to have thrown them off, but overall the experience was good.
excellent food, service was so slow today and they messed up my order. next table had same complaints. staff really odd, took off with my credit card for long time today... i hope i didnt become victim of fraud.  I dont recall service here being slow and rude, but it was definitely not fast or friendly.  Food amazing as before, but lost stars on service. I came around 5pm, saw no drunks or partiers.
This is an okay place. The prices aren't too hot, but hey, you're in the Las Vegas area so prices will be much more inflated. . . This place seems to be popular with the locals as it was buzzing with people--for a random Thursday during the hours of lunch. The wait isn't that long though so don't fret. Our sever was semi okay, but my friends seemed to think otherwise as he made faces when my friend asked for a substitution. The food was average. I don't think any of us thought it was poorly made or anything great in nature. . . I had some sort of Japanese fried noodle. I really can't remember exactly what it was. It tasted okay, but I thought it was a bit on the oily side. I think other menu item choices would have been better. My friend's fiancee had the pho ga, he said it was good. . . I really like the fact that this restaurant is in the China Town area so you can definitely take your pick of other restaurants. There's plenty of dessert and drink choices to chose from as well.
You can never fail with number 14 (pho with rare beef), and egg rolls. They are delicious, and all we ever order is a pho of some sort and the egg rolls.. We've ordered Chinese from here before, but it is not their forte.
Richard Pro here with another review.. . After seeing lines going out the door 3 nights in a row at this restaurant, I decided I had to give this place a try.. . The spring rolls were fabulous.. The pho was delicious.. The service was meh. . . The 3 color dessert was horrendous. You get a plasticcup, a mound of shaved ice on top that is impossible to eat with a plastic spoon because the ice hardens, and the green gelatin layer tastes like green hardened rice noodles. The coconut milk, instead of being liquid, freezes with the ice. Quite disappointing, really, to eat such a poorly prepared yet simple dessert.. . 3 stars. Pretty comfy and bright interior. Food is average and there are a lot of options.
Open really late and the Pho is really good. Didn't try anything else but everyone elses food around us looked pretty good. Service is ok but that is expected I guess.
This place is probably appreciated by those who are hung over. Unfortunately (in more ways than one), we patronized this restaurant sober as a blade of grass. On a Sunday morning, I found this place to be quite dark. Again, the dark would have been appreciated had I been hung over or still buzzing. The pho broth was salty and unbalanced. It tasted like it had too much star anise. . . I was adventurous and ordered the bun bo hue. Huge mistake-- again salty broth, the veggies that normally accompanies this disk appeared sad. The offering of frest mint was very stingy. Instead of cabbage, there were pieces of ripped up lettuce. Sure, they may not have red cabbage, but they could have at least cut up the lettuce nicely.
super packed but worth the weight. best PHO i have EVER had.
Wow.... I understand when you are in Vegas and your drunk food usually tastes better. but cmon MAN... food is terrible and well over priced!!!!  I will definitely not return to this place.
With some many other (better) Pho places in the area there is no reason to eat at Pho Kim Long.. . The tour buses regularly bring unknowing tourists to this particular mall strip in Chinatown. They get a lot of good business that way. Poor tourists. 5 minutes down the road are at least 2 better Pho joints with much less inflated prices.
I would gladly five stars for the food because i keep coming back for it, but the service is two star. Every time i have been there, about 5 or 6 times, the servers have been terrible. Last time i was there, one in my party ordered veggie egg rolls and they said "no, too busy now". Really? It wasn't packed. They wait for you to tell them you need your check after everyone has long since finished. I think the kitschy name is what gets most people through the door. Maybe they just bank on the name and good food. Whatever. Maybe I'll get it as takeout next time.
Let's make this short.... . Place was beautiful and clean. The Pho was so-so because mine came out pretty salty. Not much different Pho varieties. And I was a little bit confused about service. We didn't have one server we could talk to. There were multiple servers at a time. That makes it hard to ask for something if you needed it, or to get the bill.
Terrible, rude  hosting, worst ever restaurant in my life!!!!!. .   Our family  have waited for 30 minute on waiting list, but  a hostess, manager working the front was so rude that they ignored even yelled to us "GET OUT" when we pointed out to them why the group later than us were seated first. This place doesn't seem to have any rule for waiting list. I am not talking about special, excellent customer care for us  from them, considering their location. Instead of kind apologizing,realizing her mistake or trying to make experience better, the dumb manager was extremely rude about this situation, and called security guard  to kick us out. I have never experienced this kind of shit in my life ever!!.      .    Especially  unprofessional manager doesn't seem to know what he's doing for customer care..   .   Ha Ha!!!  How stupid they are and  treated customer as just trouble makers!!!.  Also, I have never seen any security guard  in this kind of  local  restaurant. I figured out  easily why they hired a big guy like a night club and how many times they kicked even their customers easily.  .   .   Their rules seemed  that Don't ask and don't  argue just follow whatever they do.   If not,  they (security guard) kick out like drunken man at club or casino. .    . YOU GET OUT !!! WHAT AN  ATTITUDE to customers. Don't ruin your day due to  this silly restaurant. There are so many better Pho restaurant  than this  in Vegas. . Suck!! seriously.
The pho here is decent, but the service is atrocious! Went in for 20 mins just to be seated and 10 mins later nobody took our order or got us drinks. We told a server we were ready to order and he started walking away and saying VERY rudely "in a few minutes"
I've been coming here for years! Way before the whole renovation to make it look more upscale. I kinda miss the old ways. When they had the fish tanks upfront and you get to pick your fish/shellfish. This place has become the official sobering spot for nightlife people. Food is always good and service is that typical of asian restaurants. Get your food quick, eat it and get out so they can turn that table. They also raised the prices. supply and demand right? Overall, I will keep coming here for good food and they're open 24/7. Don't expect friendly service but fast and efficient. works for me. after a "pho kim long" night drinking...nothing beats a large bowl of pho.
Omg they have the most amazing pho! I alway get the #14 and it never disappoints. From start to finish it takes less than 5 min for my take out to be ready and I'm on my way.
Pho isn't alwasy Pho.  You can end up with some terrible broths.  This place is always consistant and super busy.  I like that sometimes I have to wait in line.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one who likes this place for lunch
Good eating here as always, and helps that their open late for those of us that get off late from work.
Vegan options are limited, but they exist and the food is great. Service is a little cold, but at 9:45am, who cares? Vegan pho is amazing and the veggie fried rice is very good. . . Added bonus? Ronald's donuts is right up the street and they have a bunch of vegan options.
We typically come here for the pho but idk today the broth was off. 3 stars based on today's lunch.
Ate there last night and they treated us sooo poorly. I have never experienced such poor service. The waiters did NOT acknowledge us and kept ignoring us if we needed something... Even after eye contact. Multiple waiters were doing the same to us. At check out, we got DISRESPECTED by the so called restaurant owner... He refused to help us figure out our bill as it was being split into two orders. We asked if we could barrow their calculator and he says we have to use our own andfigure it ourselves and then he answers the phone and completely ignores us. We got upset at him, and he CAUSED us out! Of course we were causing back to depend ourselves but then he called security like we were some animals. This was the worse place I have ever been too.
I have made a yelp account today at this moment just to tell you my experience from this place. I have been here numerous times but don't really appreciate the standard customer service given at this place. This place I normally don't refer to friends but I decided to give this place one more shot due to my close friends wanting to eat this last night. Last night was the final draw for this place never have I ever felt violated, disrespected, and degraded in my life. We go here about 2:30 am after a night of long work and studying. It took the waiter 40 mins to take our order. We didn't get our compliment water, napkins, and utensils till all orders arrived. Numerous times have we tried to call a waiter over and cater to us all we got was stares and shut downs. They ignored for about 5 times, as they walked over and looked at us. As we finished up and was ready to pay, we waited at the cashier table for about 20 mins. The so called manager/owner comes through a young skinny Asian boy. He tell him that we are going to split the check into two my friend will pay first and I'll pay second. We have a group of four people and two people on one check the other two on the next check. He tells us we have to figure it our ourselves. We ask for a calculator right in front of him he tells us no you figure it our yourselves. The phones rings as we were try to talk to him he ignores is the whole time. At this point I  furious poor service, and now dealing with an ass of an owner. He tells me to "shut the fuck up" "stop giving him attitude" he also calls me a "bitch". At this point I'm ready to knock his ass out but I have to keep it collective, no one ever talks to me this way I was raised to knock bitches out if I was dissected especially in the way he treated me last night. I tell him "bitch" you do not know me don't you ever talk to me in that tone ever again. He then tells me to "fuck off" I don't care. I pay give no tip. As we were leaving he then runs outside trying to find security to kick me and my friends out saying we were trespassing when clearly I have to stay to pay the bill unless you want me to have a free meal. I leave he then tells me to "get the fuck out". I don't know about you but customer service and being a manager yourself customers are always right and never have I ever in my 25 years of living experience a manager/ owner swear at me. Do not I suggest do no! Ever go to this place ever!!!!!!
I must eat here at least 3 times a week! Although it is always very busy and crowded they still remember me by name each time. I enjoy the food and the service is very fast!
My experience at this restaurant and there customer service is the worst ever. My family an I decided to have dinner here on a busy night we had our baby stroller and since the restaurant was busy they asked if they could put our stroller away. When I left I completely forgot about the stroller and immediately called and they said they would put it aside so I could pick it up tomorrow. . The next day I come to pick up my stroller they said that someone has already came in to pick it up and that it's not there fault the stroller was left there and it was out of there hands. The manager Ken was very rude and said sorry but there's nothing he can or will do about it.. Be advise make sure do not leave your personal belongings because even if they do find or have it there big chance you may not get it back.
Hated it. Service is crap and servers are extremely rude. They fill the bows completely with broth so you can't help but spill it and all the meat was covered in fat. Once we finished our meal we went to the cashier to pay, we asked to have separate checks he had the audacity to give us the whole check and demand we split it ourselves.  There where 5 of us and they add in gratuity which added up to 8bucks at the bottom of our check. I will never go back to this place it was horrible and left my  party angry all night.
Good food and open 24 hours. Anytime I stop by Las Vegas I have to be here at least one time for lunch or dinner. Wonton soup is the best.
So far, the broth for their Pho is my favorite. & the chicken porridge!. . This place is one of the late night places to go since they are 24 hours. They are always busy even thought the restaurant is huge. I would rate the service 2-3 stars. It's always been like & I expect it from a place like that. It's not a big deal, I come here all the time anyway!
This place has good food!! I have been going here for years and I love that it is open late and located in a good area. I love their fried porkchops, special fried rice, porkchop combo, and of course their pho!! My favorite is their eggrolls! Theyre busy all day but especially late at night.
Beast restaurant lots of great food choices. If you are craving for soup I would recommend you going to this restaurant
After a long weekend of partying in Vegas, my 3 friends and I came here to get a feeling that only pho can give you. TBH I didn't expect much; I come from a place where the best pho are made. . . When I got there MLK DAY the line was out the door and the wait was a short 10 minutes. I order the usual pho Dac Biet with extra meat on the side and was quite satisfied with the flavor of the soup. The meat was good too; I mean it's pretty standard. . . What was lacking was the size and the composition of goodies that come with a combo. I had zero tripe, very little brisket, and very little else. The spring roll we ordered was also a bit pricey at 6 dollars for 2. . . It definitely did the job making me feel better though.
Prompt service, great pho. I eat pho all the phoking time and this was amazing! the cream cheese wontons and the egg rolls were fairly decent, standard fried stuff.
I love that this place is open 24hrs. I have a crazy schedule and by the time I get off work, I have very few and less appetizing options available at 2am in the morning. Heard about this place from a vegan friend "I recently went Vegan in Nov 2013" that this is a great place to add to my list of Vegetarian and Vegan friendly places to eat. I never had the chance to sit down and eat here. I always order for pick Up. I recommend to call your order in ahead of time due to they can be quite busy. The wait is definitely worth it. Over-all a delicious option for those late night cravings
yummy food, open all the time, sometimes semi long wait but its ok, i do recommend. . i love the bun bo hue and canh chua here
Pho Kim Long is a good late night eat. I've only been a couple times but it's always been really good. The pho with steak is great, I can never finish the big bowl but I eat like a mouse. This last time I went I had the chicken fried rice which was good, needed some soy sauce but was made really well, there wasn't any hard parts or uncooked chicken. Nothing crazy.
Have been here a couple times when I'm in Vegas. . Sure, Pho is the best hangover food you can get, but personally think they're a bit on the pricey side, and their broth isn't that special. They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.. . However, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves. . . Meh. Also there's always a long line. Unless I really want Pho and I can't wait till I get back to LA, I probably won't come here again.
I got their rice plate with roasted chicken. It wasn't as good as I hoped for it to be. The entire chicken was smaller than my fist!!! The service was horrible. Stuck up Asian boy working was acting like he the sh*t. I'll pass on this place and go to another nearby pho spot next time we visit.
Descent place for PHO after a long weekend of partying in Vegas.. . This is my go to spot on Sundays before leaving. . . This place is always packed! Parking is not difficult.
I love Pho , but my experience with this place was horrible. The hosts was rude and didn't get the order correctly. How is that possible? The pho tasted like it was out of can base soup. What was truly disgusting was the worker who was obviously sick and wiping his runny nose. Seriously? -_- . . After seeing that I stopped eating and left. Eat at this place with caution. Seriously!
Viet food is below average. Service is great. Price is too high for mostly unfavorable viet food. I am from Los Angeles, I know good Viet food, this place is just average.. I recommend you go down the street at Krung Siam for favorable Thai food with actual spices and the pricing is very fair.
Yea to expencsive and the staff believes that they are so busy customer service is out the window.
Honestly my faverate pho restaurant is pho so 1, but they closed yesterday .. so I went this restaurant instead. No surprisingly, the servers were not kind for customers as always.  and..I found a fly in my pho and they didn't appolozie for that. this place was horrible... I will never go back!!
I don't really eat Pho very often. But the number 23 or 24 is Delish! . . Only odd thing is.. when it's not busy they take forever to seat people and when it's busy they seat people really quick. Weird?
