Came here because this restaurant got the most reviews in Tempe.  The baked pastries were good.  The Cajun chicken and pasta salad were too salty.  The pilgrim baked pastry was better (basically baked turkey dinner). The mushroom and leek soup were tasty.  The atmosphere is loud and dark, and great for beer and a one pound pastry filler.
This was my second visit to CPC and it was a home run once again! The originality and character of the dishes, much like the staff, are whole heartedly commendable. I can't wait for the Phoenix location to set sail!
Loved this place. At first glance the bldg looks deserted but I gladly followed some people into a black sheet covered door into the land of Pasty. . . They have so many Pasty's  to choose from people will find that the issue is never not finding anything they like but which one to try first. . . I had the Chicken feta. Stuffed with chicken and perfectly crisp. Can't wait to go back and try another one.
Just got to Tempe and this was the spot I chose for dinner. I was tired so I called in for take-out. I ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty, a cup of leek and potato soup, and the Shirley Temple pudding. The person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later I was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food. . . Getting into the restaurant was a little confusing. I chose the door that had the restaurant name on it, but once I entered, it appeared that I came through a back entrance behind the bar area. I made my way around to what I'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area. The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.. . I'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least. The soup was great, would order it again, however, they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil, not very travel friendly.
I love the food here.  have had cornish pasty in Bathe, England and fell in love with these little pockets of goodness.  I love that they have a great selection for veggies and meat-eaters alike.  I like that you have the option for communal seating, and love the BIG steins of beer!  The servers are always pleasant and I cannot wait until the one on Monroe street opens!
The Cornish Pasty Company is fantastic. I've had many, many of their numerous options and my particular favorites have been the Lamb and Mint, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala (which was quite spicy!), the Lamb Vindaloo, and the Rosemary Chicken. The Peanut Butter and Jelly dessert pasty is pretty tasty, but it simply does not compare to the Sticky Toffee Pudding (best with the ice cream option). Sides are also really good - I really like the Oven Chips and the Broccoli and Cauliflower Bake.
Amazing Atmosphere, Music, Draft Beer, Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty, Church Pews(Feels Like I'm in Heaven), Banaffee Pie! And Customer Service was great!
So good! When I first heard of this place, I was skeptical. Maybe because of the name or how people would describe it to me as, "a really good hot pocket." So I finally went the other day, and it was delicious!! I got the Mexican, and I loved it!!!
Over rated! Doesn't compare to the pasties of the U.P. over priced for what you get too. I don't think I'll go back anytime soon.
Decent beer selection, ok wine selection, REALLY GOOD FOOD. The pasties are essentially gourmet hot pockets- a variety of different boiling hot meat/cheese/veg/sauce combinations presented to you in a warm flaky pastry. There are so many combinations that you will DEFINITELY find something you like, whether you're a meat-and-potatoes person, an anything-with-extra-cheese person, or a vegetarian. . The place itself is pretty small. It has a very unique character. It's pretty dark, and the staff is a friendly gang of textbook alternative, slightly goth hipsters. It's a great place to go early in the night or if you're looking for a more low-key place to drink and munch.
The food here is very good. I've loved nearly everything I've tried. I will say that I only ever get take out. The restaurant itself is really small and often packed. If you are in the mood for a pasty though this will hit the spot.
This location is very crowded, has decent parking and can be a bit on the dark side, but overall is nice. I think it is my least favorite of the three locations, but definitely worth checking out!
The service gets more and more dismissive every time I come here.  I wait longer and longer to be acknowledged and the waiting periods of being ignored after initial contact get bigger. At this point, I feel like coming back here knowing this is comparable to holding your breath under water...the longer you wait, the more it sucks; but for some inexplicable reason you keep trying to outdo yourself and beat the clock. But the beer is cold and the pasties are tasty...and one day I'll remember to wear my horn rimmed glasses and not cover up my sleeve tats, maybe that will help.
This small venue has more space than before, bring your friend's!  Really good food, beer selection is decent and the service was friendly, and efficient.  Great place to relax and enjoy a casual evening out, without having to venture to the pricey Mill Avenue area!
