I love guacamole and The guac here is suuuuper good, highly recommended. The menu is also very Gluten Free friendly. They serve their tacos on delicious corn tortillas. It's common for corn tortillas to be dry but these were very soft. .    The staff is also very nice. Very knowledgeable, receptive and attentive to questions and allergy concerns. .    Craft beer?? Yessir. Quite the nice little selection of local craft beer.
Met some dear friends for dinner on Friday night... I absolutely loved this place.. They were pretty busy at around 6:15 pm, they told us it would take 30 to 45 min to get a table but we were seated in about 15.. . This is what we ordered:. -Queso fundido con chorizo. -Cochinita pibil torta. -Pozole. -Elote Callejro. -Guacamole. -Carne Asada Tacos. -Fish taco. -Carne asada torta. . I tried the first 5 and all of them were really good.. I was undecided with the Tamal Oaxaqueno and the Pozole, but our server assured me the pozole was very good. And she was right! it comes with 3 home made corn tortillas and it had enough meat for me to make 3 tacos ; ) The salsa was soooo good. I liked them both but the red was the most popular in our table.. . . Oh, for drinks I had the prickly pear margarita and it was awesome... I am glad I tried it even though I barely ever order drinks with alcohol.. . Parking was decent, on the street or on the lot South of the  hotel.. Service was nice and friendly, a little slow, specially at the beginning, but it was a busy night.. . We will give it a try during lunch or earlier... because I gotta go back try that tamal Oaxaqueno : )
I absolutely loved this place! Went here on a date and it was perfect. It was classy and the food is amazing. I believe the food they get is locally grown here in AZ. We got the guacamole which was fresh and the street tacos which was also very tasty. This is a great spot to eat downtown before having some fun.
Go here for food only.  Drinks are way over-priced for what they are. For example, they want you to pay $7 for a half pint glass of very weak Margaritas.  $7 should have you feeling pretty decent after 1 and these were as if I didn't have anything.  I have a little breathalyzer for fun and I blew after one and it did not register.  . . As for food, definitely a great place and good flavor.  They are, however, inconsistent on portion size and ingredients. For example, one time I ordered the carne Asada burrito and half of it was beans.  The next time, no beans and lots of carne asada.  . . In summary, Gallo Blanco is kinda like a box of chocolates with their food, you never know what you're gonna get.  . . . As for drinks, go elsewhere.  Even happy hour makes me sad.
Absolutely the best Burritos ever. Loved the atmosphere and the service. Must visit in Phoenix.
Amazing salads and tortas. They have a modern take on traditional Mexican food and everything tastes fresh and well executed. I had such a hard time deciding because everything looked so good!. . Do what we did - pay $10 to use the Clarendon Hotel (they're attached) then head here for an early dinner. There won't be a wait and you'll be all pooled out and hungry.
One of the worst things to do is to not greet a table after they've been seated. Being a waitress myself at a few restaurants in the past, I know that once a table is sat you are suppose to greet them within 30 seconds of them being seated and no longer than one minute. That said, I went to gallo blanco with my husband and we we're seated right when we got there. The place didn't seem busy at all and there were a lot of employees walking around. We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant for about 10 minutes with just our menus. No water was brought to our table, we were never officially greeted by anyone, and we were ignored by all. Needless to say we simply got up and left because we were hungry and wanted to actually eat. I'm sure that they didn't even notice. It's a shame really because we've ordered take out before and their food was great but service was terrible.
Having a teen with special dietary restrictions greatly limits dining options.  These folks are always accommodating, always pleasant about it.  And, it all tastes amazing!
There are not words to describe the deliciousness of this place! Everything was so fresh, starting with some of the best sangria I've ever had! Our waitress was so amazing. We had never been in before, and even though it was super packed (New Years eve) she walked us through the entire menu and had great tips for everything on the menu! We ordered so much food, just because everything sounded so great, and it all was. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a little more so we can do happy hour on the patio! Even though it's a little far from home, it's always worth the drive! Love love love this place!
