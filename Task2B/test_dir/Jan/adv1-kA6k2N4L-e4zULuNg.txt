This is my most favorite place in Vegas. There is always something to do and see. You cannot go to vegas and not visit Fremont Street.
What's not to love! Old town Las Vegas. Tons of lights.. Zipline. Lights. Gambling. Lights. Great food. Lights.. A must in anyone's lifetime. And can I say this again ... I won here too!
My buddy emailed me to see if I wanted to go to Vegas for New Year.  He said he was going to Fremont street, which I thought might not be as fun as the main drag, but I couldn't have been more wrong.. . There is a $40.00 wristband charge to be on the main drag for this night but after seeing what they put out there, a very nominal charge in the grand scheme.. . There were stages set up through the street and the first band I missed - Lover boy.  I'm sure I would have laughed and had fun but I was busy drinking and making my way to the main stage to ring in the  new year with Blues Travelers....Great Show as always.  After the new year hit, we walked over to the other stage to see Vince Neil.  I've never seen him before but with a small crowd he was pretty damn fun.  This was followed by Papa Roach, who I missed.  we opted to go into one of the bars to see a 50's rockabilly band with an Elvis impersonator.. . Considering there were I believe 10 bands, fireworks and lots of people watching it is a really great way to ring in the new year.
Fremont really is a fun, unique experience... old Vegas meets the future with LG electronics. It's cool to catch the light shows and it's also cool to take in all of the old school Vegas neon that has been all jazzed up.. . There's lots of activities, stores, and a couple of stages for different music acts... only downside is the weirdos... thelater it gets on Fremont, the crazier the weirdos seem to get! With plenty of security they're pretty harmless, but watch out for pick pockets when your taking in the glitz and glam of all of the lights.. . A+ people watching...
Been to Vegas many times and Fremont Street and the Golden Nugget is where I want to stay again and again.  We were here with friends in December and had a great time. The Nugget casino is really nice. I love all the glasswork and lighting that is displayed all over.  Stayed in the Rush Tower and the room was wonderful.  Bed very comfortable.  . . We stayed on Fremont street for the 4 days we were there.  I visited the Mob Museum and shopped some of the kiosks set up on the street. Sampled some chili at the chili and bbq cook off too.
You can't leave Vegas without going here at least once, just so you can say you did it. This transformation of downtown took place about 15 years ago in an attempt to revitalize DTLV. For the most part it's a success but unless something is going on it can be pretty boring.. . I do like The Experience. The overhead archway is pretty phenomenal and I'm glad to see they replaced the lights. Originally the lights were so big that there was very poor resolution. Smaller lights make for a better experience.. . We arrived back at The Experience just in time to see the show and honestly, I wonder how I got stuck with this one. It was a gross nationalistic display; a flag waving experience complete with crappy flag-waving songs, like I'm Proud to Be an American. Oh brother. I love my country but I don't need to rub itin anyone's face. It feels icky, like a street preacher blaring his crap on a loudspeaker. Maybe next time, if there is one, we'll get lucky. Some of the light shows are pretty cool.. . Check it out and determine for yourself if it was worth it. One good thing about it is that the crowd isn't overwhelming like the strip can be. Pretty subdued and the music isn't actually blaring in your face.
Eh, it's like a glorified Bourbon St. in New Orleans. Didn't care for that, didn't really care for this.
Freemont is worth going to at least once if you are visiting Vegas. There is plenty to look at and usually a random assortment of street performers can be seen. As a local I think going on the weekend is your best bet. While it is busier, with the area, that's a good thing.. . There are a lot of homeless people that hang around the area so when you are out in the middle of the week at about 11pm it's..interesting.
A MAJOR must visit place when visiting Las Vegas ESPECIALLY at night! Better yet, only visit it at night haha. . The entire area was fun and gave the classic Las Vegas vibe. The casinos are old when it comes to the lights but inside most/majority of them are updated and modern. . The street performers and music performers are pretty awesome and free. There are of course the panhandlers but that's expected since this IS Vegas and it's downtown. . There are even some vintage machines and gave an old Vegas experience and when I say that, I mean there's this one casino named Mermaid's and you can actually put coins in the machines and you win coins instead of credits/vouchers if you win at the slot machines of course.. I think the slot machines here have a higher chance at winning because I win more times at the slot machines here than on the strip (won $215 on one penny slot and only spent 120 credits [$1.20]). . Amazing fun and my friends and I might consider staying here since some casinos are less expensive to stay at and we had a out of fun. Plus 24 hour public transportation to the strip for $8 for a 24 hour bus pass.
