Not exactly a home-run, but it was a pretty satisfying meal. . . ---. . Quick summary:. . Too many choices? Just focus on these three items: prime rib, Alaskan crab legs, and Asian food (e.g. Shrimp bao, fried dumpling, leek cake).. . My no-no list: beef slider, rib-eye (just get more prime rib), madeleines, creme brulee. . ---. . Holiday dinner price was $47.99 and the wait felt like forever ... had to wait about 90 ~ 120 minutes. . . Plate #1 (Sushi, seafood, and Asian food) - Shrimp bao (I liked the sweet bun), fried dumpling (very impressive, one of the top fried dumplings I've had), leek cake (flavorful), spicy salmon hand roll (a bit disappointed, it didn't hit the spot), BBQ eel nigiri (above average quality for a buffet), California roll (above average quality for a buffet), and Alaskan crab legs (already sliced open, juicy and flavorful). . Plate #2 - medium rare prime rib (expect a long line, one of the best prime rib I've had - tender, juicy, and irresistible), lamb chop (tasted a bit dry), bratwurst (not bad at all), chicken sausage (not bad at all), mashed potato, ham, beef slider (terrible bun and dry meat, could not finish it), rib eye (did not like it, tasted pretty dry), asparagus (juicy and crunch, good), green bean casserole. . Plate #3 - baked salmon, orecchiette pasta basil pesto & grilled Mary 's chicken. four cheese ravioli, chicken parmesan roll (all plate #3 tasted pretty decent).  . Plate #4 - creme brulee (sugar crust didn't taste right), tiramisu (excellent), madeleines (didn't like the texture), cream puff (good), gelato (chocolate peanut butter and cappuccino) . . Plate #5 - fried rice (not bad for a non-Asian buffet), Caesar salad (gotta eat some vegetable right?), Kate & Jicama salad (candied walnuts, grapes, blue cheese & raspberry vinaigrette), green apple salad (crunch, crunch, crunch ... yummy), fried tofu. . Did not try: customized pasta station, cold cut bar (cheese, salami, prosciutto, etc), pizza (there was steak & egg pizza), and artisan bread station.. . I wish there are more ice cream flavors. Anyhow, I would return if I don't have to wait for more than one hour again. And this time ... I'll only focus on prime rib and crab legs.
I am updating my review after my recent trip to The Buffet on December 28, 2013.  We arrived in line at about 7pm and were told it would 1 hour and 15 minutes wait.  So we waited.  Two hours later we were seated.  When they seated us they said there is a two hour limit that we can be at the table.  Having been sat at 9pm two hours of dining would take us to 11pm which is about when they close anyways, not like they were going to seat someone else at our table after we left.. . The other thing that caused me to change my review is that the normally $40 Saturday night buffet was changed to $48 because it was a "holiday week".  December 28th is not a holiday and should not be charged as such, especially when there was nothing extra added to the buffet for "holiday week".. . Next time we are in Vegas we will be hitting up a different buffet.
Wynn, you have to be eff'in kidding me. I know you feed your employees better than this in the cafeteria.  Most of the food was per bunk.  You didn't even have lox with the bagels but you have no problem charging 40 bucks for breakfast.  Shame on me, you lost me for life. . . The food: The only good thing about the food was the desserts.  The sushi was similar to  gas station sushi.  It was not fit for human consumption.  . Make sure you confirm they are not serving breakfast.  I made the mistake and it was super expensive for pancakes and bacon. They had no quality breakfast food at all. Shoney's quality at best. . . The line: 1 hour and 30 mins for sub par food. I should have went to McDonald's. NEVER AGAIN!
Holy S word this buffet is GOOD! Lots of food selections and all high quality. The steak was out ofSave room for dessert! Would def come back.. Oh ya and actor Kal Penn(Harold&Kumar) was sitting a few tables from us.
My family and I decided to try The Buffet at Wynn on Christmas day for their lunch. Fortunately, we arrived a little before 10 am (this is important) and our wait to get seated didn't take that long. The decorations looked a little stuffy, but that doesn't really matter at a buffet. It's not like I'm trying to eat the walls.. . I started all the way on the right and made me way through the buffet. There was plenty of choices and I got pretty excited to see a small bowl of kimchee. The food that I grabbed tasted pretty good and I went back for seconds.. . Then I went to the dessert area. There were lots of cute desserts that I haven't seen at other buffets before and I saw two gluten-free desserts. Ireally liked the cinnamon spiced cupcakes, though without the cream cheese icing on top and a few of the chocolate desserts. I tried the hazelnut ice cream and enjoyed that.
After reading a review about The Buffet being better than the Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, I decided that I had to give it a try. Wow! The dessert room is so spectacular I thought I had wandered into Mr. Willy Wonka's private kitchen. Let's just say that my sweet tooth went overboard on a sugar binge. Macaroons, gelato, flan, chocolate this, caramel that, cakes, pies, and even a candy apple made it into my montage of sweet decadence. The rest of the buffet is good, but for this price range, I still prefer the buffet named after naughty cutlery.
Good as far a buffets go. The service was a little inattentive and the food was a little uninspired. It was totally overpriced for brunch but that's what I expect in Vegas. Still, they can accommodate big groups which is nice. Like another reviewer said - there is just no wow factor. I expect more from the Wynn, this buffet is pretty tired.
The wait was a little over an hour and the price is a bit much, but it was worth it.  The selection was so huge and the food was so good that the 2 hour dining limit was just enough time. Had a great experience here!
They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Not this review about the Wynn buffet though. The people need to know how amazing this place is!. . By far one of the best buffets I have ever been to! You pay about $44 during dinner hours for an AYCE GOURMET buffet. None of that quantity over quality stuff.  It's all quality here at the Wynn in Las Vegas. If that isn't enough to convince you to give it try, they say you have a 2 hour time limit. However, that is only if they are packed with people. If there is enough seating then stay as long as dinner permits (3pm-10pm actually) or until they kick you out.. . In general anything you get here will taste above average; however, that may be an understatement, it is gourmet food after all. I feasted on endless amounts of crab, shrimp, prime rib, rib eye, lamb, and sorbet. YUM! The meats were cooked medium but you can ask for it differently and boy were they juicy. The seafood was awesome, and the sorbet was amazing as well.. . Overall: the service was friendly, the decorations look like you're in Wonder Land, and the food was amazing. It was well worth my $44, and I will definitely make another trip here the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
Richard Pro here with another review.. . My first time to the Wynn buffet, and it was extraordinary. We waited about thirty minutes and were seated in the atrium in the buffet, It's probably the nicest area in the entire place and I'm quite surprised we got such a prime seat. . . Sunday brunch was pretty expensive but ultimately, you get what you pay for. The desserts, quite simply, make you drool because there are so many varieties and they're quite pretty. Someone will hand scoop gelato for you if you so desire. Everything is beautiful and arranged perfectly. . . You'll find a delicious array of delicacies like smoked salmon pizza, an antipasto platter, muesli, a cranberry/cheese ravioli, and thickly sliced cuts of meat like turkey, roast beef, bacon, and ham. The bacon was my absolute favorite. It's not supermarket bacon, but a delicious hunk of goodness.. . Interior--extremely bright and inviting. You can probably sit for three hours, which is what I did.. . 5 stars. Best buffet in Vegas.
It was okay, flavor wise. Nothing outstanding. There were a lot of Chinese items but the Japanese section was kinda limited. I felt skimped.. . I left nothing but rice balls on my plate, hell no I ain't falling for that.
A beautiful setting full of uninspired food. Given the price, which is on the absolute high end for Vegas buffets, I expected some memorable or signature breakfast and brunch dishes. Instead, there was the same omelette stations and piles of croissants and cheese boards that you could anywhere.. . I'm not saying the food was bad. Everything I had was perfectly tasty. But to justify the cost, you almost have to imagine that you're renting a beautiful ballroom for an hour and getting the food for free.
The brisket and the prime rib was very good and the dessert was amazing, but the service was terrible. Besides that, I would recommend it (:
Awesome like the last time I was there. The prime rib was more well done than last time, but I like medium rare and the au jus made up for it. The Apple butter chicken was like chicken and waffles in one and was a nice surprise. I also had the rack of lamb, meatloaf, hen, shrimp cocktail, sushi, fried rice, crepes, gelato, oreo cake, creme brulee, tiramisu,... pretty much everything I tried was good. Can't wait to go back! I've tried the Cosmopolitan and Caesar's Palace buffets and they were fine, but this is my favorite.
I went here with my family for dinner on a Friday. Everything was delicious and the service was great. This will be my go to buffet in vegas.
I thought the deserts were outstanding but the waiter never brought refills on drinks unless we flagged him down (3 times) and the crab legs were tiny. The prime rib was overcooked.  It was great but not worth the money.
I went during the weekend brunch and found the buffet really disappointing.  I can't imagine anyone waiting in line for it.  It doesn't feel that far off from college dorm food or ponderosa with a few dishes from panda express sprinkled on top.  . . If for some sad reason you end up here, the best dish was the waffle-batter fried chicken.
I think this place is OVER GRADED by other comments. It is not worth $40 buffet at all. It is just an ordinary buffet where you only pay $20. This is my first time eating buffet and I did not know what to eat after my first or second plate. There is nothing to pick or choose since they dont have many variety. There sushi is very veryyyyyyyy limited (california roll is all I can see) , no sashimi. King crab leg are cold , not HOT. Not much seafood to choose. . the Only reason I give them 1 star because they have very good lamb chop. That was all I ate that night since there was nothing else to eat. . . I think this place need to upgrade their menu or at least reduce the price if they dont want to lose more customers. Definitely I WILL NOT COME BACK HERE AGAIN for a long long time until I heard good change from them. . . The worst buffet ever in Las Vegas, Rio or Bellagio is much better. Even Panda Express is way better food or $$$.
I paid $40 per person for New Year I was extremely disappointed thinking that the food would match the 5 star rating the hotel has. The decor and resturant is very elegant and beautiful but the food is terrible and expensive.  I left feeling ripped off as the food crap and I would of been better off going to Dennys for breakfast.
I never go to a buffet expecting to "beat the house", but at half a C-note, you will have a hard time eating enough to break even.  As a vegan, I took a risk on this place and it wasn't too bad.  There wasn't anything that was explicitly listed as vegan, and the staff wasn't sure what did and did not include diary (absolutely no desserts available without dairy).  The fact is that I ate more than my fair share of white rice and Kale salad in an effort to fill my stomach.  They are pretty tricky with the buffet . . . most items comes in its own dish, which significantly reduces the number of items you can take at one time.  The more time you have to feel full, the less you will eat . . . they have everything calculated in Vegas.  I wouldn't go back because there were too few vegan options.  However, the staff was the nicest I have experienced in any Las Vegas hotel and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.  Espresso drinks are not included in the buffet and must be paid for separately.
There was only one thing I didn't like about this buffet... that was I got full too fast! I got so overwhelmed by their selection, I didn't know where to start. Seafood, Asian, French, Meats, Cheeses, Italian, desserts and more?? AHHHHHH!!!! Since everything was so good, I'll have to recommend one item which was the smoked salmon pizza! It was very smokey and flavorful with the perfect thin crust to go with it. If their brunch is this good, I can't even imagine what's for lunch and dinner!
We been here several times in the past and the food was great, looks like They have went the cheap route. One of the reasons we enjoyed them in the past was for the quality which was not there on this trip. Caesars buffet however seems to have the right idea. Bring back the quality ingredients that made this buffet so good in the past!
The buffet at Wynn was advertised as the best in Vegas. It lived up to the hype. The lobster frittata was possibly the best breakfast dish I have ever had. Everything was freshly made including the chicken sausage. Sushi was good. Cut off the slab bacon looked great but I did not have it. Service at table was not great but I did not care. The food was that good. You must come! Gluten free friendly too!
Went here with the fam the week before New Years. It was considered a "holiday", so after waiting in line for about an hour (maybe more?), we paid $50 to get in. . . I was thoroughly impressed by the decor here. Between the holiday displays outside, to the giant hotel gingerbread display and the floral arrangements all inside, it was definitely a beautiful place. I spent a good amount of time looking around at the intricacies of the decor here. . . Service was just OK here. Our waitress kept forgetting what drinks we ordered; not just once, but maybe 2-3 times. Other than that, it was ok. Food selection was pretty limited in terms of what they had, or maybe I just didn't like the majority of their selections. I ended up going back for a lot of the same things. I will say that I am impressed by their dessert bar. A lot of different options and varieties. They are a bit stingy with their apple cider though, which they would pre-pour and serve about a shot or less of it, which I thought was weird. . . Anyway, I thought this place was pretty pricey for what they offered; I probably wouldn't come back.
It's been a while since I've eaten here, but it was very meh and overrated when I did. I had heard this buffet be hyped up to an extreme and was pretty disappointed. It gets 3 stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. We caught a night showing of "La Reve" at the Wynn, so we ate at The Buffet afterwards around 8. The crowd was dying out and it seems like the buffet was about to close, so maybe that affected the food selection and temperature. On the positive, the place was nicely decorated and the Wynn is a beautiful hotel.
I came here for dinner right before a show at the Wynn Theater. And I must say what a buffet experience it was. When one thinks of a buffet, this is not the generic one that comes to mind. If anything, this place is far from that. . . The decor is very aesthetically pleasing. Being located in a classy hotel like the Wynn one can only expect this. The bathrooms are very clean and easily placed near the eating area for one's convenience. The hostesses were very friendly as well, seating us close to the food. WIN!! :). . The food is what people come here for. They have a wide selection of choices, one will surely find something to satisfy their stomachs content. What I found most enjoyable was the beef brisket, ham, maple syrup battered fried chicken, seafood, and even Chinese DimSum like Shu Mai which I was very surprised to see. The Shu Mai here was excellent, in many ways better than NYC Chinatown Dim Sum! . . I had a pineapple juice which was tasty, as far as drinks go, they will bring you anything ranging from coffee, tea, juices, sodas, water, etc. . . The price per person was $40 for dinner, plus tip you're looking at a flat 50 which is very reasonable being a buffet with quality food and great service. The waiters keep clearing your finished plates off so by the time you're back its grub time. . . For those who loves to gorge on endless amounts of delicious food with a great selection, this is Buffet Heaven. This is an ideal place to grab dinner right before a show in Vegas.
Great selection. $15 for unlimited sparkling wine/ champagne and other stuff. . For the price you want to see quality food, and it really was. Tons of crab legs and oysters that all tasted fresh. My favorites were the BBQ brisket and tomahawk ribeye. Brisket was hella smokey and had great flavor and the ribeye was grilled perfectly and if you catch them right when it's sliced and find the good pieces. Nothing beats it. Actually everything I had was good, but ribeye and brisket stood out. Prime rib looked a big over cooked and was the one thing that could be improved. . . Roast lamb and veal were excellent. As well as the sliders they had. But the top bun gets too toasted under the heat lamp so take it off. All the salads looked really, really good as well, but come on- salad when you can get a grilled ribeye? . . Tons of desserts. Creme brulee was my favorite. They also have sugar free desserts.
Great variety, not too expensive and the food looks like it moves and is not sitting forever. . . Highly recommend it.
I've been here twice now.. and both times were nothing out of the ordinary. For $36... I had much higher expectations. . . Dishes I liked:. -Prime rib--pretty tasty :). -French toast--always down for delicious brunch food. -Coffee was good!. -Parfait--yum!. . What needs to be improved?. -Sushi... now that was nasty! . -Please make some dim summm. That's what I was craving! :(. -Pizza.. wasn't very good.. . Overall... wouldn't be my first choice of buffet in Vegas.. definitely not worth $36..
Just looking at a picture of the interior of this buffet on Yelp convinced me that I had to come check it out. And walking in, I was totally satisfied with the super cute, floral and  garden theme of this place!. . Came here for brunch and looking at their condensed menu at the front door is kind of deceiving. There is SOOO much to choose from! Including a whole section of desserts right in the middle, which one plate definitely did not hold. . . There is so much selection including your normal continental breakfast stuff, salmon dishes (including salmon pizza!), cheese, pate and crackers, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Meats, American, a few seafood.. pretty much anything you crave, you will probably find it. . . I had a small portion of everything I wanted and did not have any complaints about the food, which is a really good sign when I eat at buffets. . . Overall, super cute atmosphere and great food! And brunch wasn't too pricey either!
I'm giving this a 3 star because I'm ways kind of ehhh about buffets in general -- too much food and never worth the price tag for me, unless it's on a cruise :p. this buffet had a good variety of foods, there were a lot of vegetarian options but I wouldn't say that the options tasted that amazing and I think that's where my problem with buffets comes -- it's just a lot of average tasting food. Not to mention that since I'm vegetarian I end up feeling a little jipped since I can't try all the options. Nevertheless, the weekend brunch was only $35 so not too bad. Oh btw if you go with a larger party they add more fees which was irritating since we had a party of 15. The desserts are good :D
Five stars for the food (yum!) and beautiful whimsical floral environs.  Went at weekday breakfast and stayed through lunch, so got the lower price (pay as you enter) but the variety of both meals. Some of my faves were the wild mushroom tart, salmon and pork.  The desserts were amongst the best I've had at a Vegas buffet, esp. the passion fruit tapioca and I'm not usually a huge tapioca fan.  (oreo choc. mousse, choc.peanut butter pretzel thing and lemon glass tart were also delish).
It is so much better than Bucchanal. But the oysters were not good! Other than that, I did enjoy every single thing they offered from squid salad, rib, steak, dessert,etc.except pizza. Btw, who eats pizza at a 5-star buffet?!
Amazing food! A must go for vegans. Many thanks to Mr Wynn for demonstrating how delicious vegan food can be!
This is one of the better buffets on the strip in my opinion. It's not as big as many of the others but the selection is typically fresh and the line is clean. Two items that are a must are the watermelon salad and lamp chops that are cooked perfectly medium and are delicious. . . One of the negatives I have noticed on my visits is the service. On the last few visits it was hard to flag down our sever for refills and to clear plates. It's 50/50 as far as service goes as I've had great servers as well as awful servers, so it's basically a crapshoot.
Exactly what I expected. Lovely presentation. Great portion control for the deserts too. I especially loved the roasted garlic & cauliflower. Whole perfectly golden cloves & pine nuts too! Only negative,the pizza looked pretty sad, like mall pizza. Too bad I was not in the mood for crab legs, as I'm sure that feature is part of the price. They looked like the popular station for sure. Did I get my money's worth, yes! Did I eat 8 plates full of food, nope. I place my value on flavor, not volume. But hey that's just me!
