Made the mistake of showing up right before closing.  Ordered the trio.  The chicken was like beef jerky and dry, I guess from sitting all day.  The brisket was good and the ribs were pretty good.  I drove a long ways to get there and when I got home there was no sauce on the meat.  My friends were pretty let down by that.  Made a special trip to get there which I won't do again.  The best BBQ in Las Vegas?  Not even close.
Hands down, the best barbecue I've ever had. As their motto speaks "we rub our meat" and you can tell by the amount of flavor it in. The meat was moist and yet had a nice crust. I loved the vinegar based sauce that went well with the wonderfully cooked meats. . . My husband had. The three rib combo, and the meat was tender. Not exactly falling off the bone, but came off the bone cleanly, which I prefer. . . The portions were ample and I would definitely return.
This is my new favorite BBQ spot! The most tender, flavorful spare ribs I've ever eaten. They actually smoke the meat and there is evidence of that, since when I walked in, my eyes started watering immidietely (I have sensitive eyes) from the smoke inside the restaurant. However, that did not hinder my expirience since the food is damn good. I will be taking my food to go until some sort of vents are installed. There are two rooms and some seating outside. It looks like a hole in a wall but those tend to have really good food. I only expirienced the first room (when you just walk in) so may be the second room does not get effected by the smoke or has vents, I would not know. . Items tried: Spare ribs, wings, chicken, the outlaw burger, waffle fries, mac n cheese, hush puppies. Favorites: Spare ribs, waffle fries (so good!). The others mentioned were pretty good too. Don't belive me? On the fence? Go try it and write about it!

Harder than finding a really good restaurant, its finding one that really cares about its customers. Rollin Smoke does both! THE BEST PULLED PORK I EVER HAD and the ribs had the perfect smoky to juicy ratio. The service was superb. This place makes me wanna live in Las Vegas. A true hidden gem. . . GO CHECK IT OUT!
Holy smoke this place was amazing! Had the duo meat plate with brisket and pork with an a la carte order of the beef rib. Everything was fall off the bone tender and juicy, my only regret was not getting the all you can eat for 25 (including the drink I paid 20 anyways) and trying even more of the menu
Good but not great BBQ. A little too much smoke flavor for my taste. Yes, I know smoke is in the name. But it dominated the natural flavor of the meat. The BBQ sauce was good. The flavor was different.  It has a tang to it. The Kicken beans also had a unique taste which was heavy on the bell pepper. . . The mac n' cheese had an extremely liquid cheese sauce. My cousin enjoyed it. Me, well, it was acceptable. I prefer more of a casserole consistency in mac n' cheese.. . Ribs and brisket were tender. Hot link was dry and over cooked.. .  The owner and servers were friendly.
Seriously good ribs prepared in a pit by a man who is passionate about cooking them to perfection John is an excellent host and the restaurant is very low key but it's all about the food here.
You can smell this place all the way from the street. Best barbeque I've ever had. Being from Texas and an expert smoker myself, this says a lot. This guy puts a lot of effort and thought into his cooking. He's not just a pit master, he's a chef. Amazing food!. . I had a brisket sandwich, one beef rib and bacon potato salad. Most tender and smoky beef ribs and brisket ever. The sandwich bun was served on a really soft sesame seed hoagie bun and was typed with green onions. No extra sauce necessary. Just the right amount of flavor and nothing overpowering. Lover every bite! No wonder the walls are covered with awards.
This is the best bbq joint ever. If your in Vegas you have to check this place out. Food is amazing and the employees take in their job and food seriously. Employees are so nice. I will keep coming back
Great food! It's a small place and doesn't look like much outside. I actually drove past it the first time. Once I found it I was glad I did. Possibly the best ribs I have ever had. The wife's pulled piggy sandwich was great too!
By far the best BBQ in Las Vegas! Absolutely amazing food and great service, if your looking for real BBQ in Las Vegas this is definitely the place! Amazing section of items to choose from. I definitely recommend the all-you-can-eat for $26 and that includes everything on the menu.
Best BBQ I have ever had.  Chef Holland was super accommodating to cater a small party.  Brisket & beans were absolutely the best.  Fantastic item not prominent in menu was the pulled chicken - melted in our mouths with amazing flavor.  Cole slaw is very spicy - watch out !  Potato salad was really tasty.  Did not get to try the ribs - next time.  Our experience with Rollin Smoke was just outstanding.
We were visiting Las Vegas from L.A. We had heard about Rolling Smoke and it was terrific-- everything is delicious, particularly enjoyed the hotlinks and the baked beans. The pork, the beef... just beyond reproach. You will not find a more committed, courteous staff, these folks were serious about business, while being friendly and sincere to patrons. I understood they are from Arkansas; if so, that is one place where manners matter. Will absolutely visit again!
Great BBQ, glad to finally find some good smoked BBQ in Vegas. The location is out of the way but the food is worth it. I absolutely love the brisket, can't wait to go back
We actually cater from Rollin smoke for our office and it is delicious. Some of the best beef ribs I've ever had! The beef brisket is moist, tender, and great. And a BBQ joint has to have great sides and rolling smoke doesn't dissapoint.
Omg.... This is some gooooooood BBQ. I had the smoked meatloaf. You may consider splitting if you want to have room for their bread pudding!
Overall good experience.  I had the slider trio with a side of jalapeno coleslaw. Was expecting the slaw to knock my socks off but was anything to write home about. Pulled pork wasn't my favorite texture seemed more like pork roast. But the hot link was fantastic! Very spicy!  I was very disappointed with the country berry cobbler, lacked sweetness entirely. The place packed & decor and atmosphere were real homey. Liked the personal touches with their murals. We'll definitely go back. Looking forward to trying the smoked meatloaf.
BBQ heaven. Finally it has arrived folks. Ive tried every kind of bbq in vegas looking for that special place. here it is. phenomenal. its a little whole in the wall not in the greatest area but by all means safe. I had the beef ribs and potato bacon salad. my wife had macaroni cheese and the pulled piggy sandwich. Everything was flavorful and very delicious. they didnt over due it with a whole bunch of mediocre food like memphis. very proportionate. id say its a little pricy but the food is to die for. ill pay for it anytime when i want great bbq. props to them hope they expand.
The best BBQ my family and I had ever! . Don't forget to try their peach cobbler! Out of this world!
In the mood for BBQ? This is the place! Immediately you can smell the deliciousness before you even get in the place.  My mouth was watering already. It's a smaller quaint little place but the food packs a punch!. . We met up with some friends who had dined here before. Sylvia said 'Everything is good!'.  So we tried the BBQ Smoked Wrap with Pulled Pork, waffle fries and corn nuggets on the side. The wrap was filled with the pork, cheese, bbq beans, coleslaw and onions.   The pork was divine! Every bite of the wrap popped with flavor.  The wrap was big enough that I split it with the hubby.  We were in agreement how much we enjoyed it! Waffle fries ~ fantastic.  Corn nuggets ~ loved them!  We even had a little taste of Sylvia's Smoked Meatloaf.  Yum!  Portions here are huge and delicious!  . . I will definitely make this my go to place for BBQ.
I was pretty impressed. Never expected to find barbecue this good just off the Strip. My wife and I split a combo plate (I forget what it was called) so we could try everything. So, from best to less best:. . Brisket: Top-notch. Moist, flavorful, well-smoked. A delight.. Ribs: Split verdict. I thought they were great, wife finds beef ribs a bit too chewy but admitted the flavor was great.. Hot Links: Excellent. Spicy and flavorful.. Pulled Pork: A bit dry and not up to the standard set by the other meats. That said, there sure weren't any leftovers.. . Sauce: Pretty ordinary, really. Not bad, though, and the meats don't need its help, so it actually works pretty well in a supporting role.. . Beans: Fantastic. Almost like a bowl of chili. You could make a meal out of these alone.. Potato Salad: Maybe the best ever. Bacon really does make everything better.. Cole Slaw: Unique and original, but didn't really work for us. The only real misfire in an otherwise exceptional meal.. . This is a really good barbecue joint, bordering on greatness. When you factor in its unexpected location, it probably deserves five stars. Barbecue snobs that we are, we just can't quite grant that ranking when comparing it to Kansas City's best. Guaranteed, next time we're in Vegas, we'll be back. Friendly folks and goodfood bring us back every time.
LIP SMACKING BARBEQUE NOURISHED FROM THE GODS THEMSELVES.. . Seriously this place precedes itself. Just so you can understand the level that Rollin Smoke is on they were awarded for top 20 best bbq restaurants in america from localeats AND best burger in vegas seven. Yeah...they're pretty epic.. . It's pretty easy to miss this place, they're near the cross streets highland and desert inn, inside a signless plaza. Just look for a grill outside and you'll be fine. The vibe of the place is very relaxed mixed with decorations of tshirts, a pig, awards, and a mural. A big plus in my book is the amount of seating they have, from the times I went I never had to fight for a table. . . Customer service? Always on point. They strive for it. Anything wrong with what you're eating? They'll fix it. They always have a guy walking around asking people if they're doing fine. . . If you're coming here for the first time you should definitely try the rib tips, and outlaw burger. It takes a while for the outlaw burger to cook, nonetheless it's worth the wait. Let me start off with the rib tips. You can order 1/2 pound or a pound, if you're eating with a group of people, just share a pound it'll be more than enough. Their rib tips are mouthwatering!!! Cooked to perfection. And when you get those fatty pieces in your mouth you can taste the definition of a good bbq. The outlaw burger is just as satisfying. Let me just list the ingredients in the burger it has; brisket, onions, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage, slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ailoi. Yeah, all that in a burger. You know that one question? What do you want to eat before you die? This might be the answer.. . Tip: There's no shame in getting your hands dirty and pigging out. Dam son just eat that bbq! And you can order to-go over the phone!
Always tasty with more flavor than they flaunt.  Personally a down to earth decor and service that matches that is worth a 30 or 4 dollar signs just keep that true restaurant spirit.
"I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highwaay"(Stacy Lattisaw). We decided to hit this place up after a night of Tikibombs in Frankie's Tiki Room.  . I mean its only RIGHT. This is a little hole in the wall place but packs the BOOM! In BBQ.  I Had the 3 meat platter which you can choose any combo of meats.  I opted for the ribs, brisket, and smoked sausage or as I call it The Holy Trinity. We also shared Bacon potato salad, loaded mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. YES, YES and YES.  The BBQ was so tender and savory and topped with a vinegar based BBQ sauce that enhanced the all the smoked goodness it could make a grown man cry.  Now to address the sides....as if the BBQ wasn't enough to leave you in meat nirvana the sides comes at you from the left and pulls you in tight.  It comforts you and makes for a very happy tummy.  I am very stingy with my ratings so the 5 stars speaks the universe about this place..but hey you'll only share my joy until you go in and taste for yourself....let the meat sweats begin.
