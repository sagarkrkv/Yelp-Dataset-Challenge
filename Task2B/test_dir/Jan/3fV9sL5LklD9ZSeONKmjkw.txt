I've eaten at BLT several times over the years.  The food and service are good, but it has never wowed me.  Unremarkable would be the best description.
I was in here first week of 2014. This review is only about their dessert ,The deep Fried Oreo cookies were amazing. They served them with Ice cream and chocolate on the side. It was something different and I do recommended.
Good service, good fries, good burgers, RIDICULOUS milkshakes.  If you need to nurse a hangover that is lingering into the afternoon, or you just need a casual bite before the next poker game, BLT hits the spot (but it ain't cheap!)
Solid 4-star restaurant. The nachos are a MUST HAVE!  They are worth the $$. Burgers are ok and I wish I didn't get the shake. Tasted like a Wendy's frosty.
burgers and shakes oh my!. . i had the Lamb Burger which tasted like a lamb shawerma which was delicious. Also had the Lunch box milkshake and that was awesome.  We started with the waffle bites which was a little over priced for the amount of food but it was wonderful.  everyone in my party was extremely happy with their meals.
The food and service at BLT Burger is great. They were able to accomodate our group of 9 promptly on a Saturday night. Everyone loved their burgers/fries/shakes. As a vegetarian, I ordered a salad which was also delicious! I would definitely go back.
Laid-back, and more affordable food than some of the other Mirage establishments. Had The Stripper burger (bunless) but if you are expecting a protein burger (in the likes of In n'Out or Five Guys, you are not getting that! You are getting a burger you eat with a fork and knife. I forgot to order the cheese and the burger was okay. I should have ordered some cheese, probably would have been better. . . When I am in Vegas again, probably give this place another chance, selection looks decent, and the price is just right.
First the positive. The burger was definitely very good. Ordered medium rare which in way too many places means slightly charred. Was definitely on the rarer side of medium. Very solid burger. Something about the waffle fries just not right- couldnt even finish. Tasteless. Wanted to order a draft beer and was told they were "too warm right now". This was in middle of afternoon. Guess its not cold until after dinner?
ummm if you want a good burger go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood across the street.. . We stayed at the Mirage and there always seemed to be a line for BLT, it was convenient so we thought we would give it a go. Well the service was crap, the waitress never came by barely spoke to us......  I got the Tex Mex burger and it was like dripping in sweet BBQ sauce, gross..... not very good at all, I had two bites..... We also tried the nacho basket, just a soggy mess of more sweet BBQ over chips..... I am from South Texas and like my shit hot! So maybe I am just spoiled by good nachos.... who knows but if you are excepting good food stay away, if you don't really care then go for it.... You'll be wasting $100 for two people..... But maybe you are rich and don't care.  I blame this restaurant for giving me the worst hangover ever.... Thanks a lot Obama!
