I HOPE SOMEONE FROM MANAGEMENT READS THESE REVIEWS !!!  3 stars because the food is really good, but very disorganized and disorderly when it comes to ordering. We stood in line over 40 minutes with people cutting in, and to make it worse,  once we got the food we went over to try to find a seat ...another 35 minutes , there were more people seated down waiting for friends to bring the food over than people actually eating.  It became a lounge rather than a dining area!   By the time we found a seat,  food was cold and it will never taste the same . WHAT A SHAME TO FAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCCESS.  At least put signs outside stating that you cannot save seats if you are not consuming food!
Best MEXICAN FOOD in the USA. . . My favorite here is the al pastor tacos. To order your meal you walk up to the station labeled with your meat preference (pollo, chorizo, al pastor, etc). You then take your food and purchase it at the register behind the line. There is not much seating and definitely no service but the food is extraordinary, especially whatever they put in that green salsa that they add in the tacos. . . If you've never been to Vegas and want to try some good food this place is a definite MUST.
The Al Pastor were like none I've had before. PHENOMENAL DELICIOUS PERIOD. I've been looking for this style of Taco in LA and no luck, go figure. The service was great cause the Paisas making the Tacos were down to earth and I understand the Lingo ;-) I also enjoyed the Chiles asados and cebollitas. Nothing beats these Tacos Estillo Tijuana!!!
As soon as you step in, the smell of oil and taco smoke was overpowering. I took my order to go, there was just no way I can eat comfortably inside the restaurant without chocking on smoke. The cool thing is that they make the tacos right in front of you. Our taxi diver spoke very highly of this place so we decided to try it. We order tacos of pastor, buche, carne asada, and lengua. We ordered 16 tacos and 2 quesadillas for 2 people lol. However, customer services SUCKS! I wanted salsa and the taco people sent me to the cashier, then the cashier sent me to the taco people again. Waste of time. I ordered so much food and they were stingy on the salsa. Also, the cashiers are pretty rude and so are the guys making the tacos. They have so many people go there they treat you like cattle. As for the tacos, I expected more but they were just ok.
Awwww man! Was super pumped to finally have tacos el gordo again (after moving from San Diego to LA I've been deprived) but this location does NOT live up to it's name. The one in San Diego is so, so perfect... :'(. . Basically came here last night after clubbing with my girlfriends and was having the munchies late, and happily found that this place was still open at 2am. Ordered the adobada (spicy pork) and beef tongue (langua) tacos, and shared a $10 carne Asada fries with my friend. . . The tacos were pretty good, meat was moist and good amount of cilantro & onions. . . But when I asked for salsa sauce they told me "we don't have anymore" twice (after disbelief & shock). I believed them-- only to realize moments later that plenty of people seemed to have salsa on their tables. -__- so my friend had to get it for me, because goodness knows why they hate me and won't give me any sauces. . . The carne Asada fries were baaaaad. The beef was way too dry and SUPER smokey tasting. It's like they accidentally left it to smoke for hours ... . . Basically the San Diego location trumps this one.
Spicy pork! Literally so amazing! So go eat a ton of tacos. It's so worth it.
Large variety compared to a lot of other Mexican food places! And for a decent price! The menu ranges from $2-$12. The best thing about this place is that they're pretty much ALWAYS open!
One of the benefits of staying at the Wynn is it's close proximity to Tacos El Gordo.  . . Tacos El Gordo is a must visit place for my buddy and I when we're in Vegas.  It really is that good.  . . All the tacos are great, but the spicy pork is something special, which likely explains why the lines for pork are ALWAYS longer than the lines for beef.  Each line serves pork or beef, but not both, so you need to pay attention to what line you're in.  . . This place pulls a crowd more or less ALL THE TIME, so be prepared.  But, they are set up for a crowd, and the lines move pretty quick.. . Note:  No alcohol is served, only soft drinks.
Drunk food at it's finest. When you find yourself leaving the Encore at 3am, have a hankering for some recovery food, this is the logical place to swing by. The place was packed. No surprise there, most of the people there were in the same state as we were. Between the three of us, we managed to order enough food to sample a small portion of the menu. I tried to order chicken tacos, but to my surprise, they don't have chicken. I'm not a huge fan of pork, so this left steak tacos for me. My girlfriend had the adobada tacos, grilled jalapenos and we all shared the carne asada fries. The table favorite was the fries. All 3 of us have been talking about them since. I now have a go to place when I'm in the area, those fries are going to haunt me.
Oh geez, where do I start.  I've heard so much hype about the tacos here and I was excited to finally make it to the Las Vegas Blvd. location to get some to go.  There was no parking so my bf dropped me off while he circled the parking lot.  As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed. It was like a crazy zoo with people just everywhere. It was hard to tell where to order as there were 6-8 lines.  I grabbed a tray and jumped into one of these lines. I was maybe the 15th person back so it was a bit of a wait.  When I finally got up to the window, the guy serving informed me that the meat I wanted, asada, was not available in that line and I needed to go to another line.  Actually, he kind of yelled all of this at me in Spanish and after going back and forth for a few minutes I finally understood his irritated frantic pointing to the signs taped to the glass in front of him.  Frustrated and defeated, I slowly made my way all to the way to the back of another line and waited and waited 15 more minutes.. . Finally I got up to the front of the line and it was smooth sailing from here.  I ordered 3 asada, 3 chorizo, and 3 adobada.  Once I got the food, I didn't know what to do since they were on a plate on my tray and I needed them to go.  I must have looked like a lost puppy because one of the workers cleaning up the soda machine asked me if I needed help and with huge relief I said yes, I needed these to go.  So he directed me to the cashier and said she'd put them in a to go back for me after I paid.  Done and done! I got back in the car and we immediately started going to town on these bad boys. I must say, they were amazing and worth every frustrated minute of waiting in line.   Can't wait to go back and do it all over again, except this time, I know what line to get into!!
Best street tacos in Vegas. Possibly the best I have ever had and I buy them on the streets of Mexico. The asada, buche, cabeza, & spicy pork were great. They are small and cost about $2 each. Sopes, tostadas, mules, quesadillas, french fries disguised as nachos are also available.  . . The lines are inefficient. Each type of meat has its own line. Not great if you go alone. A group that splits up works best. . . This place is EXTREMELY loud. It's in Vegas on the strip so most patrons will be intoxicated. . . The flavor was great. I recommend it.
They have some pretty bomb tacos here! It was really good and not too expensive either. The only thing is if you want a variety of things you have to get in a lot of different lines. Each line offers different type of meat. On the plus side, they give you free grilled onions and peppers!! The downside is that its super packed, and it takes awhile, especially if someone makes a big order. We ended up lining up for ~30min until we got to the front to order.. . I ended up eating 3 tacos, a quesadilla and shared some carneasada fries. It was the perfect amount for me.
Great tacos and a fast service considering how busy they do get the seating since a lot of people but he usually busy around the times I go they do offer regular sodas as well as or horchata and pineapple
Based on proximity to my hotel and Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place. It looks a little sketchy, but I'm really glad I did... the food is amazing and fairly inexpensive. The nice outdoor seating area is a bonus. The tacos asada and adobada are delicious. I ordered one of each and then, immediately after finishing those, I went back for 2 more. It's not fancy, but it's great food.
The people who claim this taco joint is the greatest ever are probably not from the southwest. It is a very typical Mexican taco joint - all types of beef-related meats (carne asada for most, tongue and brain for the the adventurous. This place has a straight-forward menu. Heads-up:  when they ask you if you want everything on your $2 tacos, you are ok'g onions, cilantro, guacamole and salsa. The service is good and quick. I went at 6:30pm on Wednesday evening during CES and there was no line.
5 stars ..not because this is a 5 star dining establishment , but because for the product they sell-it's 5 stars hands down!!!! I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and finally came..sooooooo tasty! I feel like I'm in Mexico! . I had a Lengua taco, asada mulas, and a asada vampiro. All 3 were yummazing! Service was very fast & very friendly. The place was also clean inside and smelled goooood. . I'm sold!!! Officially in love and will return anytime my taco craving hits :)))
This is my go to spot after a night of clubbing when I'm craving tacos. They are open until 5am on Saturday,  which really is EARLY Sunday morning. They are usually very busy but are efficient in getting your food out asap. There are separate lines designated for which tacos you want. I love how they also accept credit cards including AMEX.. Their tacos are good! I get the Taco de Adobado which is their pastor. They shave the pork off the spindle and even cut a piece of pineapple. It's absolutely delish and you must try it!
I love this place!  It is pretty cheap, although the $2 tacos are small for someone like my husband that could eat 5 of them.  Love the spicy pork.
Went here while I was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend. We went in the afternoon and it was packed! They have late night hours and I'm sure if I was close by fter club or party, I woud be there! I love Mexican food and being in the West Coast sure gives you a different perspective of what real Mexican food should be like.  I had Tacos de lengua, carne asada and buche. All delicous.  . . One thing bad, the fact that you can't order all your tacos on one line. I had to ask my friend to get me buche from the line she was in. Definitely going again if ever in LV again.
OMG! I am in love with the tacos at this place. Every time I visit Vegas, this place is a must! Everyone is so friendly, been here a couple times, (let's say...three times a year) & the staff still remembers my face every time.
Stop reading and go get tacos now!!!!!!    Always delicious!!!!!    Best I have ever had
This place has peer unprofessional people their all rude and ignorant I have gone twice and both times were very bad experiences !!!my experience on this location was horrible I had to walk out and eat some were else cause of the bad customer service they have ...so I went their with my family it was like 13 of us so I go in the my first time their I ask a lady in Spanish hey how do I get to the tent outside were the door and she said well walking how else that is the rudest thing an employee can say to a customer so I asked for a manager and she just walked away I was shocked of how rude that lady was ....so I let it go me and my husband go to the adobada section and my husband told the guys hey what do you have here it was our first time their the guy didn't say anything he just hit the menu sign with his hand and said don't you see ...that was it my husband just walked out and went to 7/11 to buy a sandwich when he was craving the tacos but they were very disrespectful ..I'm a manager for multiple businesses and their management have to get on top of things and show those people great customer service cause they don't.  have one bit of customer service ....they have to understand that customers are everything with out them your nothing they have to understand that they have a salary or a check because of customers I will never go to this place again very unprofessional and disrespectful people their....
Best food ever. One of the most unlikely highlights of vegas. This is the real deal.. Try everything.
EGG-cellent inebriated location for those late night munchies. . . I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego...and they were absolutely delicious...and I was sober. One can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed them if I werent sober.. . So remember this.... . It has been a long and fun night of fist pumping to insane EDM music...your drunk because for some reason your liver thinks its a god in vegas...you dont want to travelfar becuase your lazy...and you dont want to overpay because your cheap. So where do you go?. . TACOS EL GORDO is your solution!. . -TACOS EL GORDOs is probably the best tacos in Vegas. -TACOS EL GORDOs is as authentic as it gets. -large variety of proteins to choose from. -closes late!. -located at the end of the strip. -taste absolutely amazing...especially when drunk. -cheap!. . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. . UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
Lengua and adobado tacos are good. Ask for easy sauce on lengua because it is spicy. The buche(stomach) tacos is salty and I'm not a fan of the intestine tacos but the fiance liked it. Adobado taco sauce is really really good. The tortillas were good. I hate how crowded it was and how it was hard to find seats but if you team up just manage your time and look for the different meat lines. Next time I need to get the carne asada.
Oh. My. Goodness. These Tacos are AMAZING. Like if you are going to eat at ONE PLACE while you're in Vegas... PICK THIS ONE!!!. . The guys serving up the food are so friendly and will give you grilled pineapple if you tip them. (I know from experience haha). . It's a hole in the wall kind of place and it is always packed but with good reason. The food is unbelievable!!!. . Make sure you order a MULAS with Spicy Pork. It is like a cheesy quesadilla with spicy/delicious/fresh pork and amazing toppings. I don't even know half of the ingredients that came on my tacos but WOW THEY WERE GOOD!!. . Super cheap too. I would eat here every day if I could.
Wow, spicy pork = Mexican shawerma incredible, best tacos I've ever had no competition.
Who wants to get food poisoning during your vegas vaycay place is bomb  just do not get the alpastor meat made me sick all night!
Taco de Adobada (spicy pork). Enough said. Hands down the best tacos. Better than King Taco/El Taurino. I hate that I have to miss these tacos... The one past San Diego is almost a 2 hour drive for me, but I'm always down for the drive! . . Description: order first! Pay after! There are different lines for different tacos. Choose wisely! I just get in the Adobada line and order a ton of spicy pork. . . First, 2 corn tortillas are dipped in the meat oil and is placed on the pan grill to sizzzzle. Omg!!!! Sounds fattening, but oh so good! The worker cuts slices of the flavorful and tender meat onto your tortilla- if you're lucky, you'll receive the crispier parts of the meat - texture is perfect and soooo good (you'll get what I mean when you order)! The worker will ask if you want everything (cilantro, onion, guacamole) - SAY EVERYTHING! Sometimes, if the worker is in a nice mood, he'll give you pineapple slices that is on top of the rotating meat! Dang, they don't skimp on the meat.. . Too far? Just drive. :D . . Tips: ask for grilled green onions and jalepenos. Sooooo good! Don't forget your radish (sliced or whole) and limes at the cart!
You have to try the spicy pork taco. So many great flavors. Savory pork, creamy cilantro sauce, citrus, some heat, and a whole lot of love
Love it!, no need to say more. Everything on the menu is good but if you're coming here try something different and don't go for boring carne Asada just saying.:-)
Hella good tacos - especially al pastor.  Been here a few times and I occassionally have day dreams of this place during my taco craves :)  Theyre open late too!
My socal friends highly recommended this place so we decided to hit it up. There was about a 20 minute wait, but luckily for us, our friends had went ahead and ordered for us, so we skipped the line. . . Our group of 4 ordered 10 adobada tacos and one large adobada fries. The adobada isn't actually spicy so it was easy to devour the tacos. The fries have some green sauce drizzled all over it that my friend likes to call "crack" sauce since it is so addictive. . . This place is probably too far to walk from the middle of the strip, so I'd recommend taxiing here. It is well worth it!
This isn't my first time here at Tacos El Gordo and it definitely isn't my last.. . This one in particular, is at the end of the strip, near circus circus and encore. I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place. . . The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos. The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it. The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!. . I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people. It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green "crack" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.. . The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10. For vegas, this is great, cheap food. I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends.
Place is really random off the strip but is freaking amazing.
I'm from Texas, Houston to be exact so I've had plenty of Mexican food in my lifetime. The spicy pork tacos had me chewing and shaking my head in silence. So good, best tacos I've ever had. Great food for a low price right on the strip, what more could you ask for?
Best tacos I've ever ate in my whole life. It's a must going here when ever we come to Las Vegas.
The best lengua sopes I've had in town.  Very tender, melts in your mouth and flavorful.  You have to get to see for yourself!  Ideal for a late night cravings with friends.  I hear they normally have lines out the door, but I got lucky on a week day and was able to order & get my food in 20 minutes.
This place is great. Amazing quick food. Nice people. Additionally it was a treat to eat at a great place in Las Vegas and not pay ridiculous prices.
