When I got here I saw the lines were long so I'm thinking oh this must be a good place.so I waited in line. Was getting annoyed the way they had the line set up and they were only letting few people in at a time as if we were getting on a ride.. well I was fooled! Buffet wasn't as good as I thought it would be. They Did have a huge selection but food tasted pretty plain. Not very flavorful.  I tried a lot of the food there and wasn't very satisfied well other than the crab legs. Food wasn't that hot too. Dessert section was good though huge selection and good ice creme. That's about it.
I rarely give a 5 star rating but this buffet got one from me!!! The buffet is so big. And I've eaten a plenty of buffets. The staff was friendly and quick. The selection will blow your mind. This buffet is so big. Man. I'm stuff and still haven't gotten a chance to try everything yet. This is crazy. Generally a buffet this huge the food is lacking. But this place is up to par. I give Rio Carnival World 2 thumbs up!!! Better than Caesar's Bacchanal and Cosmopolitan's Wicked buffet!!!
This has been my favorite buffet for a long time.  It is huge.  They have a very large selection of food, and it's all really good stuff.  A wide variety including Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and American. The only thing I noted this time compared to previous visits is that they didn't have some of the fancier dishes anymore.  They used to have hasenpfeffer (for example), but no more.  I seem to recall other things like chateaubriand, but nothing like that this time.  They also seem to have removed their burger station (which is good...why pay so much for a buffet only to get a burger??).. . Overall it's still my favorite buffet, but I have not been to the Bacchanal at Ceasar's...I hear good things about that one, but it's very expensive.  The Carnival World buffet is on the "Buffet of Buffets" pass, which is very cool.
Ive been to this buffet almost every time I come to Vegas, which isn't very often maybe 3 times a year. I don't know why today wasn't as good as the last couple times it just didn't seem that great.. Our waitress was very attentive friendly and made sure we had whatever we need.. The snow crab legs were dry and not worth the effort they didn't have a salad bar with vegetables.. I don't know exactly if and when this changed.. But there is plenty of food from all different parts of the world to accommodate your taste and the dessert bar is very good.. At $32 for an adult dinner it just seems pricey.. Maybe I need to check out some other buffets.
One of the best buffet in las vegas.. I got the $49 deal which gives you a 24 hours pass to many of the hotels, I will go to eat dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner again that 4 meals in 24 hours great value
The Vegas review sites all tout the Rio's buffet, and then you say to yourself "Well, it' sounds good, but it's off-strip, so meh, I'll skip it.". . Bad choice when you chose a strip buffet over the Rio. . . Here you pay less, and get more.  More seafood, more beef, more different food (samosas,   enchiladas and trout!)  Not hugely crowded like the Bacchanal buffet, nor overly fancy like the Wynn.  Nor is it grungy and crappy.  It's just a nice, good quality, lots-o-choice place.. . However - you get pretty basic desserts.  And therein lies the rub for some people.  If you're a dessert person, this is not the place for you.  Well, if you like bananas foster it is, but not much else for the sweet tooth.. . Service is basic and honestly, they could really do better at clearing your plates or being a bit more attentive, but it's still worth going here.
I gamble so I eat free buffets. I would not eat this buffet if I had to pay for it and I sure as shit wouldn't pay the $22 they are asking for lunch. . As I write this I'm thinking that if I wouldn't pay for it then I probably shouldn't eat it period, right? But buffets are quick and easy, especially if you have a line pass. The salad portion of the buffet is decent. Hence the 3 stars as opposed to 2. It's clean and fresh. They do a high volume of customers so they refresh often. The green curry with eggplant as well as a few other dishes at the Asian station are  pretty good. There are also quite a few veggie and fish options to chose from.. . BTW the locals discount has been cut form 50% to 25%. All I know to do is complain. Squeaky wheel gets the grease right? But I digress, if you pay with points it doesn't matter.
While $29.99, $32.42 with tax, proved to be too much for this feast.  While there was a lot offered at good quality, it wasn't worth the price as compared to some of the finer hotels.. . I was there at 10:15am on a Saturday.  Mimosas are served, and I had two (delicious).  They had a good amount of breakfast and lunch items,  and I had a little of each.  Yes, lunch is already served.  Brunch.. . Nothing was outstanding, but all was good.  It isn't an enormously large buffet, but ample nonetheless.. . I think I would go back if 1) I was drunk, 2) I had a hankering for AYCE, 3) I was stuck without my car, 4) held hostage, 5) I was drunk.  Oh I said that.  Well, if the price was less...I would go.
Its expensive for sure, but it is  THE BEST buffet in Vegas. HANDSDOWN!!! They have everything you could ever want and its all good. Nothing tastes processed or like it was made to cut corners since there is such a high turn around. The line is constantly long because its THAT good!!
With dozens of buffet choices in Vegas, there are better options.. . I wouldn't say this buffet is bad, but it's not really good either. Lots of stuff that should have been hot, or even warm, was cold. I also made the mistake of getting the unlimited adult drinks, which ended up being some of the worst wines I've had in a long time -- we're talking undrinkable bad, and I'm verging on needing a 12 step program.. . Maybe try going here drunk, the food might taste better, or you just won't notice.
Grew up coming to The Rio Buffet. . . They have a good variety of cuisines but my favorite were the made to order soups like Pho , egg noodles and other Asian dishes. . . Oysters were a fail here. Super slimy, small, mushy and not pleasant at all. . . Prime rib was standard, they have raw horseradish. . . Shrimp Cocktail were a good size and plump.. . Crab legs were pretty thin and annoying to open for the amount of meat you get. So I gave up on those after about 3.. . Pho broth is delicious. You can add all kinds of different meats including bo vein (Vietnamese meatball), rare beef, etc. Hoisin and condiments including fresh herbs like basil, bean sprouts, lime, etc.. . Desert station was plentiful but the most popular was the ice cream/sorbet station. Nothing really stood out for me here. . . Overall, for $35 it's mediocre.
Just re-visited this buffet and it still lives up to its reputation.  I think a lot of people put this place down, because they are either spoiled with fine dining or they have too high of an expectation!  This is not an Outback Steakhouse, nor is it a Claim Jumper or Olive Garden.  Don't come expecting to get that good quality of food.  The food is very very descent, but it is not gourmet.  Very rare is there ever a gourmet buffet out there.. . It takes 1 minute and 40 seconds to walk the entire food area (non stop)!  24 seconds to walk the entire dessert area!  That is 2 minutes and 4 seconds worth of buffet!!  Think about it...go walk 2 minutes anywhere and you will get an idea of how long the food serving area is (and there is NO repeated food item like what you see at other buffets).
I'm doing it, I hate giving a review for a 3 star place. But since I have never had the chance to review back in its glory days this shall be my review. . . In it's glory days I always went out of our way to eat here. I mean itsnot the easiest place to eat when you stay at the southern part of the strip. But this maybe my last stop here. I've never really liked Rio for gambling anyways, so the only reason to come to this casino has become moot.. . Okay lets talk food. So in the past, weekend brunch came with champagne. . . Me: can I get some champagne for the two girls in the party?. . Server: "Do you have an all day pass? Then no.". . The food was average, it used to be that I felt like I was eating world cuisine. I understand that I got there at 1030 so it was mostly breakfast, but does the rest of the world not eat breakfast, I think not.. . Their gelato was fabulous, but I will not be spending $25 a person for gelato again. I will stay on the strip from now on when we visit vegas. Maybe The buffet at Bellagio or the one at Caesar's. Sorry Carnival World Buffet, but as I was writing this your 3 stars dropped to 2.
Just had dinner there and although they have a huge selection I expected better taste and quality. The sushi was very dry looking and didn't taste that good. The prime rib was tasty but also dry. The New York steak was good though. I also had peel and eat shrimp which tasted fresh. There wasn't a wait which was nice. The waiter was this sweet older guy who was fast and kept our drinks full. He brought such a smile to my face as he was really nice. We didn't have desert but the desert area was stocked with lots of good stuff.
