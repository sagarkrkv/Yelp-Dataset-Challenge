They have the best rooms for large groups of people 2 king beds a large couch that makes in to a queen bed and steel has room for a person to sleep on the other half of the couch..  The bath room has two showers and two toilets so makes getting ready to go out much faster!.   On the down side to get to the pool you need to walk a long way throughout the shopping mall they have so you fell out of place in you swimsuit. the parking is as fare as the could have possible put it from the rooms..  It would be nice if they would think of handicap people It makes me fell like my back is going to go out trying to get to my car!
My trip to MGM for NYE was a tale of a bunch of mistakes, that ended up just fine.  . . We made reservations last July 2013 for NYE, and made resos for suites with another couple. They are "something" with mLife, so we got good rates, etc. We confirmed a few times, and when they arrived there were no suites. WTF?  Apparently bigger "whales" sucked them all up. They worked for 2-3 hours to finally get one, we ended up with a standard Exec Queen Room. . . We looked at the rate, and realized something was wrong. They had denied us the suite, then charged us for the suite. I went to the front desk to voice my concern (nicely) and they did correct it and gave me the correct rate, and comp'd the resort fee as well. . . Overall, a nice hotel. The suite was great. Our standard room was nice. Rest of hotel quite good considering all the abuse this place takes.
So, funny story... Me and my then boyfriend (soon-to-be fiance since he proposed on that trip, now my husband), went to Vegas and stayed at MGM for our 5 year dating anniversary. We checked in, and headed up to our room in the "west wing" section. We're super excited, luggage in hand, unlock the door- and there's a woman laying on our bed! Umm, WTF?! She's as surprised as we are... Apparently her husband was down at concierge changing their room since they didn't want to be close to the elevator. Either way, it was shocking to say the least! I'm not quite sure how they managed that to screw that up? She left immediately and we just kept the room since we were exhausted. Later on that night we realize why it's so terrible to have a room by the elevator. Every time it's used you hear a loud DING "GOING DOWN." So obnoxious! Especially at 3am! The plus side was that we received a special "gift" of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne- that was actually intended for the people who originally had the room! At that point we didn't feel like saying anything since we had no idea who or where they were, and frankly, we deserved it! . The hotel is nothing special. Rooms are meh and the west wing is super dark. It's reasonably priced and has some good restaurants. I'm not a fan of the lions there. Their habitat is depressing to say the least, and it made me feel bad for them. Nothing worth coming back for, but it has made for a funny story at least.
After going to Vegas so many times I finally decided to stay at MGM Grand for the first night of this trip. I can't say anything great about this hotel but I can't say anything terrible either.. . The check in process was long because of a problem with the computers. I got a comped buffet because of it at least.. . I had the Petite King room. It was small, even for only me. The sink was tiny and there was no bathtub. If you're staying at MGM with more than 1 person I recommend upgrading to a larger room.. . The location of the room was good. It was right near the elevator and had a decent view. The casino is huge. There's a lot to do in it.
The MGM Grand has gone through a nice renovation in their rooms, including the addition of Hakkasan restaurant and nightclub. I always wanted to stay here and I was not let down. It's so elegant... from the lobby to the building at night... a dark color with green highlights.. . Check in: It was around 2pm on a Friday and I waited about 25 min. to check in. There was a long line but it moved quickly. There is flavored water available, a lion statue as a centerpiece, a cool big screen promoting their weekend events and playing Tiesto music videos... to dance to while waiting in line, haha! To check out, you can do it through your phone, from booths set up in the lobby, or on your TV. So easy, even a lion can do it! :p. . Room: I booked a Grand King Room but got hooked up with a great view of the strip in the Grand Tower wing! The room was nice and clean. Their front desk was excellent in answering their phone, I only had to wait between 30 sec. - 1 min. every time.  . . Hakkasan nightclub (Sunday): I came to see Tiesto on a Sunday/Industry Night. It's an awesome club, it fits MGM look and feel very well. I was able to enter the club around 11pm by having a presale ticket you buy offline. Tiesto went on at 1am and the dance floor was packed! There were many tables surrounding the dancefloor. I believe they should limit a number of people in the dance floor, it was crazy, but it was awesome when Tiesto went on... 3 hour set!. . Traveling from MGM to other hotels?. MGM has a Deuce bus stop right outside their front doors, and a tram in the back of the hotel. The Deuce bus travels along Las Vegas Blvd. all the way to Downtown Las Vegas. The Tram goes to Las Vegas Hilton, I believe. The Deuce is $8 for 24 hours (great!). Tram is $5 a single ride and $12 for the day. The upside about the tram is that there is no traffic as it's elevated in it's own lane. If you take the Deuce, you may have to deal with the Blvd's traffic.
Stayed here one Friday night, arrived around 12pm. We called early to see if our rooms would be ready since check in was at 3pm. They said there was no guarantee that the rooms would be clean upon our arrival, luckily they were. We had an ok view, it was blocked off by the main entrance to MGM but we could see the top of NY, NY. Since we were only there one night it didn't matter, but request a room higher up, we were on the 11th floor. The beds are so comfortable and the service is great, I called and asked for an extra blanket, it arrived less than 4 minutes later. We also received a call 10 minutes later making sure we had gotten the blanket. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Only complaint is no vent in the bathroom, this is such a pet peeve!  The MGM has a perfect location on the strip, we mainly hung out in NY, NY so it was nice not having to cross the actual street and just use the connecting bridge instead. The casino inside MGM is huge and nice. We didn't play there because the minimums were $20 or more. There is plenty of dining directly inside there as well so it really is a one stop shop. Another complaint is the "perfume" smell in the halls, I understand its purpose but MAN after only a few minutes I was in headache central. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely stay here again.. . Tip: Don't even touch or pick up the extra items in the room (alcohol, technology kits, water etc.) we simply picked them up to look at them and were charged for a bottle of vodka and a technology kit upon checking out. We explained that we only looked at them and nothing had been opened, they said that they go by sensors on the stands of these items; once they are removed you are charged for them. They removed the charges, but just an extra hassle you can skip when checking out.
The room was nothing like the pictures, checked out on Dec 18th, 2013, didn't get my $200 safety deposit returned until today, Jan 8th, 2014. I had to call MGM several times to get the error that they were having with the deposit fixed. They kept telling me that they had returned the money and to go check with the bank, but in the end, the issue was with MGM. If I had not noticed this error, MGM would have taken 200 from me without me knowing. Can't trust this hotel resort anymore, stay away. Go to Bellagio or The Venetian.
We stayed here for the NYE 2013/ 2014. When we walked into the room we found stains on the comforter and a dirty bathroom.  The day before we left no one came to clean our room.  When we came back we had to call twice and wait until close to midnight before someone came by.  The front desk was very unhelpful with the situation amd wanted to blame us for the mishap.  We will not be booking with the MGM again.
Nothing special has mid tier hotels go in Vegas. . They do seem to have more food choices from the low end food court to the higher end steak houses.. . Rooms were big clean but the maid service were very cheap, if you have a partial bar of soap they will not leave a new one until it is all gone. We were there a week ran out of soap the last day.I am sure I lost enough at the table to buy a new bar of soap for my entire floor for a week
The MGM grand is a lovely hotel with a fantastic night life. I really love their Beachers Madhouse, it was definitely a high light, along with crush! They have so many places with in to eat, drink, and play! As far as rooms go, I loved my room. It was just a 1 bed, 1 bath but very nice and fairly priced. I enjoyed my stay there and the guest services were very accomedating.
dated, kind of shabby 70s feel in the non-remodeled portion of the hotel, nice soaps/lotion
Overall the MGM Grand Hotel was good hotel, with a nice spacious lobby, helpful check-in staff, and an overall fresh and modern feel to the hotel.  The rooms were comfortable and quiet, and the bathroom a fair size.  . . There were a few problems however.  1) The gym was NOT included in the (pricey) Resort Fee.  Hotel guests only have access to a "Cardio Room" with a limited selection of ordinary treadmills & elliptical riders.  2)  The cleaning staff missed our room one day.  We had to call Housekeeping to come clean our room one evening.  3) The WiFi could be spotty.  Oftentimes we had long waits for connections & downloads.  4) We visited on a weekend, when the hotel seemed packed (overrun?) with 20-something partyers.  Yelling, drinking & running around hallways and meeting areas until the wee hours of the morning were common.  Thank goodness the room walls were thick and sound-dampening.
I hated the exterior green of the hotel so I expected to be underwhelmed, but my wife booked it for us because it was a good deal. . . I was extremely pleased with this hotel. It was well designed to entertain you while you wait in the long lines to check in, and there are lots of elevators that only serve about 7 or so floors each so you can get to your room quickly. Once on your floor the wagon wheel design means that you don't have to walk a hundred miles and this design makes it very easy for you get where you need to down at the casino level.. . There was a good food court and easy access to the monorail which makes it easy to avoid renting a car or catching a cab to get around town - this is a huge value which can't be understated.. . We ate at Shibuya which was fantastic! Sure it was very expensive, but the quality matched the price (for Vegas) and the environment was WOW. Price was about $450 for 5 people, so bring a fat wallet.. . We saw Ka and really enjoyed it -  no complaints other than it was more than we paid for O which I thought was a better show. There also was a segment that was all video instead of people due tothe accidental death of a member last year, so that was rather disappointing. Honestly I think they would have been better off just skipping that part rather than showing a video as I wouldn't have known I missed it and wouldn't have felt short changed. I understand why it wasn't real people and agree with their decision, but I'd say just fill the time doing something else less risky with real people and that would have been just as good. I think we paid about $350 for two people plus fees, but we had front and center seats on row P (which is is as close as I'd want to be for this show - don't get much closer). . The rooms were very modern, super clean (way better than Bellagio and as good as Four Seasons). Loved the room and the well thought out bathroom. There's also very convenient access to charge your gadgets so I'd call this the best hotel room I've enjoyed in Vegas.. . We stayed on the 25th floor which had the downside of being behind the David Copperfield sign which meant there was this screen pattern which made it hard to enjoy the strip view that we paid extra for. Definitely ask to NOT be on these floors when you check in and all will be well. . . The food court was good and the Casino was excellent. Cigar smokers will enjoy the Davidoff store as well.. . Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel and I'd call it my favorite place I've stayed in Vegas.. . I think I paid $110/night plus a crapload of fees.
Old on the review but my hubby and I booked a  room for to celebrate our birthday. Loved it. Its pretty huge and you feel as if you're walking in a circle but your not because their are a lot of shops, restaurants and shows inside the hotel not to mention casinos. . . We wanted to eat at their Buffet but the line was way toooooo long so we decided to eat at the  Avenue Cafe  (inside the hotel as well). Very great on the food and customer service. But IF you're on a budget, they have McDonalds and other reasonable fast-food joints in the hotel, other hotels along the strip.. . ALSO, the drinks are awesome! . . . Oh and the our room was nice & Clean.
I couldn't be more upset about the changes made to The Grand if I tried. The new "Smellovision"  hits you like a wall of Axe body commercials and never stops. I hid in our bathroom in the Grand Tower room, where even the ac was tainted and trying to kill me. Toxic chemicals give me migraines. We had to change hotels.
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 43/100. . Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. . . LOCATION: . More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.. . EXTERIOR:. Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway/lobby/drop off/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.. . INTERIOR:. HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. . . SHOPPING:. Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.. . I feel like MGM used to be good, but with the addition of all of the newer hotels on the strip, it's losing its game. So unfortunate since MGM owns so many of the hotels on the strip!
No coffee maker or mini bar in room & an extra $25/day if I wanted one.  The place stunk (everywhere you went) of strong cheap musk cologne (nauseating).  Nothing to do really other than drink or gamble.  And an extra $134.00 exit/resort charge on my checkout.  There will be no return for me to this hotel.
This is the spot for young revelers looking for a well maintained but in-expensive stay on the Strip.. . Recently refurbished the giant lion bearing hotel is probably one of the most famous on the strip.. . The decor is simple and too fabulous but since its refurb it is more modern than some of the competitors. . . If your looking for something Basic and not fussed about having a central location then this is a good choice
The rooms are lavish and the service overall was super great. Everything was clean and kept well.  The hotel plays host to Hakasan (not sure on the spelling), which may be one of the best clubs in Vegas. Besides the front desk person "Arthur" from Glendale asking us for a $100 bribe for an upgrade and saying "that's how you get a upgrade in Vegas" it was a great experience.  I will never returnto MGM, because customer service is that important to me. I'm sure it was a isolated incident but not the best way to start a trip. I would still recommend this place... Just make sure you keep a hundo handy for upgrates. ;-)
I had a wonderful time. The place was beautiful and the service was superior. Friendly atmosphere and professional staff. The prices are reasonable, yet you still get the full Vegas life experience. The food is excellent. It's an all in one package here at the MGM. You get it all. .  I will definitely come back here.
Solid hotel.  The SkyLoft suites were pretty darn impressive.
We stayed here for a few nights and were pleased with the room overall. The bed was very comfortable and room was a good size. Nothing special but a perfectly okay hotel room which is all I need. There's no fridge in your room and don't commandeer the minibar or there's a $50 restocking fee. Also, they do offer free wifi included in your resort fee but it's spotty at best. The hotel is huge so you might need a Sherpa guide to find your way back to your room. . . As for the casino, it's not bad but is very oddly laid out and can be confusing and had to navigate. They do have a decent variety of table games and machines and okay drink service. For something different, find the old school jockey horse racing game in the corner of the casino near thebuffet. This thing is cheap and fun but can get crowded. You bet a quarter on these mechanical horses that race around the track and they each have odds. No modern tickets here, you play with actual quarters. . . This place is huge and has an interesting variety of restaurants, bars, and quick eats including Whiskey Down which is a 24 hour whiskey bar, Pub 1842 which I enjoyed, and a food court with McDonald's, pizza, etc. The location is far on one end of the strip so it's a trek to the other end of the strip. It's definitely doable but know you're in for a bit of a haul. . . I prefer to be in the center of the strip so I'm central to everything but enjoyed staying here and will be back if I can get a good rate.
Hotel was great, especially for price. We stayed in a King Executive, gives you a little more room than a regular king. The bed was super comfy, loved the blackout curtains! The shower was super huge and had one of those rain shower heads on it. But here lies the problem as well. By the time we left I was bathing in bottled water because the water is so heavily chlorinated by skin was burning and I was getting red/purple patches all over myself. My husband started having the same issue right before we left, but I have super sensitive skin, so mine started after about the 4th shower I took. I looked like I had a chemical peel on my face every time I got out of the shower. I asked the front desk about this and the woman told me about the chlorination and that a lot of people visiting have that issue!!! Um, warn people then!!! I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who 1. doesnt have sensitive skin and 2. isnt staying for a full week. Restaurants inside are yummy, and close enough to walk to other great ones with ease as well. Even though its close to the end of the strip, you can walk all the way to the Wynn or the Sands Convention Center in a little under an hour. That's what we did everyday. after being on our feet all week for a convention and it was super easy.
As much as I liked the hotel, I did not like their professionalism . I left some items behind in the drawer and called them in half hour. They said there was nothing there!!!! I called them the day after and filed a claim but they told me, they haven't found anything. This is  ridiculous! I would have paid the mailing fee. Not professional.
One of the best features in the hotel rooms are the black out shades! OMG! Its crazy how good they work. If you are out all night and dont want to be waken up by the sun peaking through the crack in the curtains, you have to stay here! You will never know what time of day it is outside with the black out shades down. . . The beds are also very comfy, as well as the pillows. I hardly noticed my fiance moving around during the night. So its pretty easy to get a good nights sleep here. . . Another awesome bonus, walking in from the parking structure up to the lobby, you pass a Fat Tuesdays! Yum! Dont forget to keep your glass and save a couple bucks on refills!. . One drawback, the casino floor is very large so you can definitely get lost. But there are alot of employees around that are helpful. . . Overall, I cant wait to stay here again!
Alcohol - Yes, this is Las Vegas. If you are not drunk after being in Vegas for 2 hours you are doing something wrong. Plenty of bars in the MGM Grand including video poker bars where messing around with quarters will get you free drinks.. . Food - Some good restaurants in this hotel including places like Joel Roubechon and Hakkasan. Also has a food court if you are looking for fast food/cheap places.. . I really enjoy staying at the MGM, not only because they comp me, but the rooms have been updated. Even the regular rooms are nicely done with newish furnishings and are generally clean. The Staywell rooms are really nice and have the best showers in Vegas. Not because they have some crazy shower heads or they are huge or anything like that but because they have vitamin infused water. Not sure if it was a placebo affect or something but damn my skin felt nice after that shower.
This is a review for the MGM grand casino floor and main floor - since I didn't stay here. The casino floor is really big? Bigger than New York New York casino. There are lot more game tables and a lot more slots machines. Not sure if it got more crowded but was bigger. . . The sports book was a lot bigger and nicer than New York New York. There was also a night club at the MGM grand right across from the rain forest cafe. Which for people staying here and want to go clubbing is a great plus! It's one of the most coolest clubs in Vegas to check it out! . . Over all a great hotel, they also have AMAZING sky lofts here (that I researched about) which if you have an extra grand to spend - definitely stay there! Check this place out if you haven't already!
