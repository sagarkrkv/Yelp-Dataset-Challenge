PLEASE NOTE - this review applies to their New Years Eve experience only.. . Food was wonderful, service was excellent (with one big exception explained later), but the whole reason we went to Mix, and paid their higher price on New Years Eve, was the view which was a HUGE disappointment.  I would not recommend Mix for New Years Eve.  Any other night I would say it is a great choice.. . First the good.  The 5 course tasting meal was phenomenal.  We didn't just like all the courses, we loved them, and all were simply fantastic.  The opening veggie martin with truffle topping was one of the best appetizers I have tasted.  The wine pairing will also very nice, and our waiter was fantastic during the whole meal service.  It was also a very fun and festive atmosphere.. . Now for the bad.  The whole reason we chose Mix, and paid the higher price, was to see the fireworks from their vantage point.  The problem was, we had no view at all.  The only people that had a view were the few tables that opted for outside seating.  The restaurants does NOT overlook the strip, and thus if you pressed your face to the window on one side, you could barely see two of the hotel fireworks.  The view is from the Mix Lounge, however that was closed, and restaurant patrons could not enter.  The other disappointing fact, was our waiter, who was so friendly and attentive, and throughout the whole meal, assured us just before the fireworks he would show us the good spot to stand.  The only problem was, after 11:30, he disappeared, and never reappeared.  There was no good spot, and this seemed in retrospect to have been just a con to get an increased tip.. . Mix is a fabulous restaurant, and I would highly recommend it, but avoid it in New Year's Eve.  It is a waste of time.
miX Lounge on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay offers the best open-air panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip. It opens at 5:00 p.m. and the night views are stunning. The restaurant and bar offer an upscale casual way to impress your date or your own eyes with all the lights & sparkles of Vegas over 400 feet below.. . Olivia Z. and me stopped in miX before hitting the Michael Jackson ONE show cause it is very convenient to the theater. We were lucky cause there was no cover charge on Christmas Eve. After a quick ride up an express elevator, we eagerly hit the balcony to take in the mesmerizing view. Bring a camera and smiles.. . After snapping a few pics, we headed inside and grabbed a seat at one of the many tables facing out. A waitress popped over in just a few seconds and our first round of drinks was on their way. miX Lounge is dark, but the menu is backlit and kind of cool. The faux leather seats and aluminum tables actually seem cool, too. . . Olivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time. For round two, she switched to a Pear Martini ($18) recommended by the waitress. It features Grey Goose La Poire, Champagne, St. Germain, and a Pear Slice. Much like Olivia, this was even sweeter than the first drink. She liked them both.. . For me, I was recovering from the previous night's drinking binge and stuck with some beers. Both were fine and $9: Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Sierra Nevada Kellerweis.. . This review is strictly for the miX Lounge (not miX Restaurant) and the beautiful views from the outdoor patio..  - Service was stellar. .  - Drinks were decent..  - The vibe was cool..  - The view was dazzling.. . It's time to add miX Lounge to the mix of must see attractions in Las Vegas.
If you're in the mood for a lounge, mix is the place to be. People get frustrated when they are expecting a nightclub, but for what it is, mix is one of the best. . . The lounge is directly connected to the rooftop restaurant and you can see the contrast of themes where the restaurant is heaven and mix is hell. The dark interior of mix is perfect for its amazing view of the strip from the very top of THE hotel. . . Probably the best view in vegas, so check it out!
Ate here on a recent visit to LV, and it was recommended by a young lady (she sounded young anyway) at Picasso when I couldn't make a reservation there (because I waited to late to reserve).  Server's name was Scott and he was so nice and helpful which made for a great dining experience.  Ordered a couple of appetizers - Charcuterie sampler and seared duck foie gras - both really, really good.  Dinner was surf & turf with some kind of beautiful fish topped with more foie gras over brussel sprouts.. again, really, really good.  Companion had boneless ribeye and mashed potatoes.  I thought the prices for everything were reasonable.  And let's face it..  You know going in it's more expensive than the average fish/steak house so its silly to complain it's pricey.  I really liked this place.  I would totally recommend this place if you want a great view of Vegas with excellent food, wine and top notch servers.
I celebrated my wedding anniversary and by far the best food I've had in Vegas. The food had so much flavor. You will deff get your money's worth! We tried the shrimp cocktail it was amazing! The Cobia was so tasty   And my husband tried their chicken everything was good. We also went to the lounge right next door and it was fun good music, good drinks and beautiful view can't go wrong with that!
Came here for Christmas Eve dinner with reservations and ordered the seared scallops, which the boyfriend liked a lot. I was not so much of a fan. The sauce was light and nothing spectacular, albeit the scallops were seared perfectly. The seating was a bit awkward, as we were seated and a round table at the edge of the restaurant near one of the large points of view where you can look out into the city. I sat in a position where I was directly facing a couple who were seated directly facing me. No sir, I am not checking you out...you just happen to be where the view is. . . The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3? The boyfriend ordered from the  Christmas menu, in which he chose a raw & cooked vegetable tart as an appetizer, beef filet mignon as an entree, and Christmas log as the dessert for $95. The appetizer was very rich in truffle sauce. The entree, which was the star of the meal, consisted of shiitake gratin, pommes Anna, and bordelaise sauce. The shiitake gratin was spectacular! I could eat them nonstop. The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection, not too chewy. The Christmas log was a standard small roll cake. I had the roasted pineapple dessert, which was a pineapple cake on the bottom, with roasted sliced pineapples on top, pineapple chips and sauce. It was delicious. At the end of the meal, one of the chefs walked by and offered freshly baked madeleines. Best madeleine I've ever had in my life.  Also, service was very attentive and courteous. :). . I would consider coming back for a prix fixe menu, but only if I got a table with the view of the city. The view from the side of the restaurant outside is lovely as well (although too cold for winter, brr).. . One last thing, as beautiful as the view in the bathroom is, the stalls were not up to par for an upscale restaurant. The white paint looked like it was coming off and there were no designs anywhere to be seen. It didn't seem elegant at all (after you see the view and walk to a stall, you'll see what I mean). There were also only three stalls. (I'm picky with bathrooms).
Hadn't been here for about 5 years - still a great lounge on the 60th floor with amazing strip views, lounge seating, large bar, huge narrow balcony to sit/stand, small dance floor - awesome time at TheHotel Mandalay.
So my gf and I were in Vegas for the new years and we were dying to try foie gras (which is illegal in CA) and a lot of people recommended to us MIX. Luckily, we were staying in Mandalay bay so we just walked up to MIX and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.. . First off, the lounge at Mix is amazing! Since Mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of Vegas. Additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.. . As for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. You start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. We were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.. . As for the food:. . Assorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- Hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. XD. . Foies Gras filet mignon- 5/5- For $60, I was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. However, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! The foie gras pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. I definitely, recommend this dish at MIX.. . Mash potatoes- 3/5- Pretty plain. Kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me.... . Creamy Spinach- 3/5- Nothing out of the ordinary here.. . Wagyu Beef- 4/5- This baby just melts in your mouth. However, it's a little bit salty for my taste. Luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.. . Overall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. If you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try.
Food and service were good, not great. The bread basket and cheese cake were the best parts. Make sure you get a Restaurants.Com certificate first . Makes the price worth it.
I came here for dinner with several friends on our last night in Vegas. It's a nice space with amazing views and the lounge area is really cool.. . Tuna tartar - Very good and easy to share. You can get a half or a full portion.. . Dry aged rib eye - Sooo good! I recommend this with the bordelaise sauce.. . Mac & Cheese - This was just ok and it's a huge portion. Easily enough for two.. . They have a pretty extensive wine list and a reasonable selection of wines by the glass. Service was excellent.
A stunning lounge/restaurant located inside Mandalay Bay on the 64th floor with a great view. Went here with a large group of friends, probably 14 of us and had an excellent time.. . The ambiance: On the lighter side and that huge dining area is so welcoming that it gives you room to breath. Loved the decor and the bubbly chandeliers. I mean whats not nice in Vegas.. . Food: We got a few orders of Tuna Tartare, cheese salami and prosciutto platter and some other appetizer cant remember. K so my main 5 stars are based on the filet Mignon steak with Foie Gras this was by far the most memorable Filet I've had. Cooked to perfection and the foie gras being on top of the meat gave all the oils and juices to the filet which made it more outstanding. . . Service: All right normal. . Overall if you're seeking a place that serves great steak and want to try or simply have foie gras try this place out it should impress you.
Recommended by a friend to come here, I paid them a visit on my most recent Vegas trip. Have your cab driver drop you off at theHOTEL since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!. . The minute that I stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, I was taken back by the all white decorations. I love it! Absolutely sleek and chic. We were seated by the window. It's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. It was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.. . They started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. Now, I'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! It was creamy with a hint of sweetness. I would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! It doesn't stop here, it gets better!. . I ordered the filet mignon rossini w/ foie gras and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. Although I enjoyed the rib-eye, I believe the dish worth raving about is the filet mignon! It came with mashed potatoes. The filet was tender and juicy at the same time. The foie gras just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! I couldn't get enough. Prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. She recommended the Syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.. . Our waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. I also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. The bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. I noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. When he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. So sweet of him! Aside from that, we also ordered the MIX candy bar which has coconut and lime sorbet. Totally worth it!!! The chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. Perfect combination.. . After our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. Since Mandalay Bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. We were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. WHAT? Lame... . . Overall, MIX has given me such a good experience that I will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!
I love Mix! Such a great alternative to clubbing. My friends and I weren't too excited about getting in the ten mile long line for light, so we chose to come here instead. This lounge has its own elevator access at TheHotel and if you're afraid of heights, you're pretty much screwed because you can see everything through the glass elevator. But the view is outstanding!. . It wasn't too crowded, easy to order drinks and the DJ was playing a good mix. We were able to grab a booth next to a group of cutie Asian girls, so there's alot of eye candy here. But the best thing about this place is the view! You cannot beat it.. . Can't wait to go back!
