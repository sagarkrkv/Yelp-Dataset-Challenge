Idk what the problem is for the noon 5 star people, but this hotel is the bomb.com! Mr. Trump has style, class and an amazing staff. On to of being upgraded to a suite, we got a great rate in hotwire.com for our stay. Highly recommended. Off the busy, smoky, loud strip. Made for elegant people who love privacy, comfort, respect and visual stimulation. 5 stars all the way!
I stayed at Trump Hotel for Thanksgiving last month.  It was a busy weekend and the rates looked attractive for a 5-star property.  I really regret not going with Venetian instead since it was only slightly more.  . . To preface, I actually don't hate on Trump.  I rather enjoy his Apprentice show and most of his dealings, so I was very open minded staying at Trump for the first time.  But fact remains that this was a really subpar experience.. . . First, location was horrible.  . . Our taxi drove us in, and you get off the freeway to see the row of strip clubs before arriving at the Trump hotel.  The location is offstrip even though it looked pretty near on Google Maps.  It's a ten minute walk to the Wynn which is on the Northern end of the strip.  They have a shuttle to Wynn and Caesar's, but it's not very convenient especially if you want to take a break in your room mid-day.  . . Worse, one side of the tower faces the Railroad track.  If you're a light sleeper, don't bother; it's pretty loud.  I couldn't believe the rep I spoke with just dismisses it like it's normal.  She toldme to book the room on the other side next time I stay.  So 50% of the hotel experience the train multiple times a night... really?. . . Second, while the resort fee is quite standard now in Las Vegas, the amenities that came with it were disappointing (wifi, shuttle, water).  Oh, and pool access too.  Except that during my stay the pool was up for "renovation" for December.  This is fine and understandable, but what was insulting was the note to tell guests to buy a $10 voucher to use Caesar's Palace pool (and ride their free shuttle there!)  . . I can't imagine having your five star hotel guests to pay for a ticket to use another hotel's pool while being shuttled back and forth.  If you claim that pool access is part of the resort fee, then at least provide complimentary tickets on request.  It's almost comical.. . . Finally, the overall staff and experience of the hotel is far from a true 5 star hotel.  It's 4 stars at best.  Everyone from doorman, shuttle driver, front desk.  None of them really understand how to delight the customer.  They're just doing their job day in and day out.  The shuttle drives around the hotel to stop at next pickup, instead of letting you off at the hotel entrance first.  The doorman opens the door but no one offers to help with the bags.  The concierge won't help get you change but have you wait ten minutes for a front desk agent.  Many many more examples lead me to believe that the staff isn't trained at the same expectations at other 5 star hotels.. . . I could go on, but you get the point.. . . The Good:. - Smoke free hotel. . The Bad:. - Location is off-strip, ten minutes walk to the Wynn.  The ride there passes through the strip clubs.. - On the back side of the tower you hear the train multiple times a day.. - Staff (shuttle, front desk, bellman) are all less experienced.  They are courteous, but really rough around the edges that you wouldn't expect from a 5-star hotel.. - No customer support.  I emailed some of my concerns in this review to them and never got a response back.. . . Overall this is far from a 5-star experience.  Their rooms and suites are discounted for a reason.  In retrospect, I'd rather pay a bit more to stay at Venetian or Bellagio.  I would never stay at Trump again.
Staying in Las Vegas I really loved this hotel. Its quiet and there is no large casino to walk through to get to your room. The bed was super comfortable and the room was really nice and large and very clean. The hotel is located right next to the fashion show mall which we could walk right through to get to the main strip area. . . All the staff was extremely friendly, the shuttle runs on frequently and on time which was convenient. This was the third trump hotel I have stayed at and it was a pleasure. . . We missed our shuttle to the airport and asked the front desk if another one could be arranged but before that happened the "house driver " offered to take us to the airport and shuttled us in a fully loaded luxury SUV to the airport. What a great and lasting impression that made.... we definitely will be back!
I love this hotel, mostly because it's non-gaming and you don't have to walk through a smelly, smoky casino to get to your hotel room. The lobby is lightly perfumed and smells amazing. I stayed here during my first visit to Vegas, and it was a great first experience!. . My friend and I were able to check in early, and the concierge recommended several shows and restaurants as it was our first time and we were trying to assess what we wanted to do.. . The rooms were sparkly clean and beautiful, and the bathrooms are huge! There is almosta full kitchen with cook-top and all, so if you rented a car or drove, you could easily run to Whole Foods and cook some meals if you wanted to.. . I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have stayed elsewhere in Vegas, and though I do have other favorites, this is an extremely high quality hotel for a low price tag. The only downside is that it is on the far side of the strip so it takes a long time to walk to City Center. Otherwise, it's great.
3.5 stars. . Paid $140 on priceline for a room right after Christmas. Yeah, it's a nice hotel for $140, but not quite 5 stars. Here's the lowdown:. . PROS. 1. No casino, no smoking. Nice if you got kids. 2. Food at restaurant was pretty good. Amazing room service pancakes, super fresh at 1am!. 3. Clean and spacious rooms, comfortable beds;  . 4. Free shuttle to Caesar's (when running on time). . CONS. 1. Valet service takes awhile. Valet is included in $25 resort fee but there's no self park option (unless you park at Nordstrom's across the way). Sometimes its nice to have that. 2. $25 resort fee. Cmon, now. 3. Bag check took at least 20 mins to get our bags delivered when we checked in. Granted, we forgot an item in the car that we asked them to bring, but it wasn't crowded when we arrived and there were plenty of staff around. Hence, why self park is nice sometimes. 4. Can't really walk to strip. Yes its close, but the sidewalk ends headed towards the Wynn and we stepped over a homeless man getting there. Free shuttle didn't run on time we found so would have been better to taxi it, then wait 15 minutes for shuttle that didn't come, and then taxi it.
Family perfect hotel, beautiful decor and a well trained staff! Only downside can be location and if your into gambling inside your casino. This is the for sure choice for anyone wanting to bring family to Vegas and keeping away the realities of real Vegas along with the stench of cigarettes.
Trump is my new favorite hotel destination in Vegas. I had a fantastic stay even though it was only for an evening. Everything about this place screams elegance from the moment I stepped into the lobby to when I first opened the door to my room.. . It was so nice to step into a hotel and not having to inhale the cigarette smoke-filled air of a casino. The room was suite-style with plenty of lounge chairs, a couch, and a coffee table. There was a pseudo-kitchen with an electric stove-top, microwave, mini-fridge, and even a toaster. The king-size bed was super comfortable from the pillows to the mattress and linens. Free complimentary coffee and two bottles of water. Double sinks in the bathroom. There was even a freakin' jacuzzi in the bathroom! Don't forget the super soft bathrobes. Last, but not least, a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom.. . The one knock on this place was that the TV in the bedroom was broken, but after notifying the front desk at check-out, they waived my resort fee. I wish I had extended my stay here longer!
Let me tell you how it is... We are 30 something's in case u are wondering.... . The Trump hotel is amazing... We got a basic king size suite and it was HUGE! The room comes with a kitchenette and jetted bath tub! The room was prefect... No complaints. It's a short walk to the strip (0.3 miles to be exact) and yes there are sidewalks the entire way... Just cross the street. No it's not a casino... But get over it... No smoke and madness... Actually kind of refreshing.. . So here comes the BUT... You ready for it... There is a train track a block from the hotel... We stayed on the side of the tracks and wereawoken multiple times throughout the night. So I would suggest requesting a room not close to the tracks... And hopefully you can avoid the "chooooo chooooo!". . PS... The TV in the bathroom was an added bonus and fantastic... Basically.
omg the trump tower...... spectacular. Stared up at it while driving up and all i could see was gold gold gold. walked into the more glitzy gold inside to this VIP registration thing in the back,...? WHAT?? damn did i feel like a hobo though in this place, wearing my sweats and shit from the ride over...  . . Everyone was super helpful though, thank god. complimentary valet and shit outside and the standard "may i help you with your bags?" BUT NO ONE EXPLAINED THE ELEVATORS. There are two elevators. One that goes up to like the 30th floor or something and another that goes up to the 60 something floors. We lived in the 63rd floor. so confused for a little bit..... . . Anyways, we got the penthouse suite... and oh my god, it was beautiful. double doors, walked into a pretty amazing living room with a nice ass tv and a fULL KITCHEN complete with an oven, full sized fridge, microwave, sink, stove, pots and pans, utensils, dishes, and a freaking coffee maker. AMAZED. two bedrooms on either side of the living room. One of them was a master which had a queen(?) bed, walk in closet, two toilets, a shower, a nice hot tub/bathtub with jets, and two sinks/mirrors (that you could watch tv in it). The other room was just about the same, but one of everything but no walk in closet or bathtub. and all in gold and white scheme.  . You get free wifi, and new bottles of complimentary water (SO NECESSARY) every time you finish and the maids come to clean. and chocolate! and fluffy towels and bath robes. Their alarm clock comes with a dock for iPhones (not for iphone5) and you can play your music and blare it while youre getting ready and pregaming! . . Now, i didnt really get to experience the other stuff they had to offer inside the hotel, they DO have a free shuttle to from the hotel to the Wynn. AND when we were late on Jan 1st to Light and there were no taxis coming anytime soon, one of the workers offered to drive the hotel car (Escalade) to Light for us and we would just pay him aftewrwards. He gave us his number so we could get picked up without any hassle after we got fucked up too ! perfect, no wait for taxis either. . . Although it is slightly off strip, you can walk across the mall (which is acrosst he street from Trump) to get to the strip. It'll take you across the street from the Wynn or if you walk a little farther, just a few steps to the Venetian. I had a really really really amazing time at the Trump, even though i dont really remmeber much, but i will miss the comfortable beds and even more soft pillows for my raging hangover
The rooms were clean and surroundings were beautiful.  The hotel didn't have a casino, but that was a good thing.. peace and serenity to escape from the busy strip vegas life!
