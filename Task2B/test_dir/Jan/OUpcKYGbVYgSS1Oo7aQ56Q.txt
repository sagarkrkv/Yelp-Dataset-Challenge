Such a great hotel! Never stayed on this side of Vegas but would def recommend it. We stayed here New Year's Eve and did the party in the grand ballroom and the Fremont st experience. The band in the ballroom was awesome and the food was great. 4 course meal with seafood and meat and open bar with premium liquor!. . The doors don't open until 9 which I think should be a little earlier because I felt that we didn't have enough time to eat, drink, and dance. Would like an extra hour there. . . Right outside of the casino doors, there was a stage set up for Freemont at experience and blues traveler was playing! Great way to spend New Years!!. . The pool here is awesome. The Hot tub gets a little crowded and isn't as hot as I'd prefer, but it's open from 7am-2am! Not a bad way to end a night. The slide is worth every bit of shivering after. Even though the pool is heated it still feels pretty cold after getting out. The sharks staring you in the face while sliding down is un like anything I've ever seen. Pretty cool pool!!. . If you have never stayed downtown vegas, give it a try! Worth the $6 bus ride to the strip if you need to go.
Each year my friend's plan a large event and book a block of rooms in the Golden Nugget.  This was my first time staying in this hotel (I usually stay on the strip) and I was pleasantly surprised by their overall ambiance.  They have some great dining options (read: bottomless mimosa buffet), spacious and clean rooms, and a bad-ass pool area.. . Let's be serious, a slide that goes through a shark tank?  Yes please!  I'm pretty sure I went down the slide more times than any of the kids in the hotel...  And we never got kicked out of the pool area even thought we constantly took over the hot tub and adult areas.  Major props to their staff for putting up with a few hundred rowdy idiots.. . Notes: Make sure to put the "do not disturb" sign on your door or you'll be woken up around 9am.  Yes, I know that isn't early for some, but this is Vegas after all.  And more importantly, there are multiple towers, it is easy to get confused when coming in late at night.... . I'm sure we'll be back next year.  Already looking forward to the slide!
It's is a good hotel for those on a budget but want to stay on the Strip.  The Carson Tower room was clean and updated, just noisy.  Heard everything outside on the 10th floor.  The hotel and casino are clean, friendly staff.  Would recommend staying there.  The Grotto had excellent food and wine.
This hotel is just fine.  Nothing spectacular, and priced accordingly.  Most of the staff was friendly.  Downtown Vegas is great place to visit. I'm just not sure I would stay in this area again.  In the future I think I''ll just bite the bullet and stay up-town at one of the many luxury hotels, and cab-it to Fremont section for one evening.  Not trying to be a snob, but the crowd is a little on the rough side. This is a smokers paradise.  It gives you a flavor of what it must have been like 20 years ago in society. Unfortunately, we're not smokers so it was a little bothering. Again, it was good value, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
I love this hotel. I usually stay in the Gold Rush Club. The rooms are VIP and you need a card to access the floor. The room is spacious. The King bed is large. There is a         safe and mini fridge in the room. I am not big on gambling but I enjoy the downtown scene it just enough drama for me.  . . Room service is not good. The food is always dry/overcooked.  I had leftovers in the fridge from the oyster bar but there was no where to warm it up.
Explosive vomit and diarrhea!. . Really wanted to like this hotel as it is a favorite of my parents.  Not sure how it got a 4 diamond review with worn carpet, tired room decorations (and we were in one of the 'upgraded' pool view rooms) - and one of the best - pay $10 for the pod coffee in your room.....Skip the $25 VIP check in too.  On the phone, we were told it included not waiting in line to check in or the buffet and access to the spa for basic things like the sauna - but upon arrival, that was not the case.  Front desk and check in people both on the phone and in person seem to be a bit flippant - not at all the customer service you usually receive at a '4 diamond' location.. . We had been together as a group of 8 people eating at all sorts of restaurants on the strip - then down to 4, having stayed downtown at Bally's and then our last 3 nights at Golden Nugget.  We all ate together at the buffet - nothing fancy but great service and great selection of food based on the price - also had a really great meal at the Italian restaurant inside of the Golden Nugget.  On Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I ate at Lilly's the Asian restaurant and had fantastic service and great food.  On Wednesday night, when we returned and got our vegetable rolls and Pad Thai to go, it was also great at 10:30 pm, but at 2:30am, that's when the trouble started.  My girlfriend was hit first with vomiting and diarrhea then it hit me 30 minutes later.  Lots of fun with only 1 bathroom.  I thought we were going to die - and this went on for hours.  When I could finally pick up the phone and report this to the front desk, I let them know what was happening, because we certainly wouldn't want anyone else to go through this.  I asked if someone could send up ice, water and 7 up which I thought might help with the constant and non-stop vomiting and diarrhea.  They acted like we were drunk or hung over (I think we each had a beer that day) which I'm sure they get a lot - but explosive vomit and diarrhea.  About 40 minutes later, room service showed up with a $38 charge for 3 small bottles of water and 7up in a carafe watered down with ice.  I signed the slip in desperation for some relief and thought we would deal with it later.  . . Front desk had told us we would need to do an incident report, but the thought of looking or talking to anyone was too much until  finally by Thursday night, we thought we could keep it together long enough to have security up in the room to do the report.  He apologized profusely and was wonderful, and when we told him about the room service charge, he said that was definitely something that should not have happened.  He said he would turn in the report and because it was the weekend, we probably wouldn't hear from anyone until Monday.. . Monday, Tuesday - finally on Wednesday we called and here is the response we received from Richard Smith, claiming to be the manger of risk management of all Golden Nuggets.. . By the way, we were only asking to have the room charge reversed.  As a courtesy, they should also have reversed at least one of the room nights.  Nothing doing  - without proof - just our word against his.  We calmly mentioned we owned a restaurant and knew the importance of safe food handling and that given the rapid onset of these symptoms and that NO ONE ELSE in our group had these symptoms, it was from something that was contaminated, cross contaminated and / or someone didn't wash their hands.  Without a doctor's report, nothing he could do.  I mentioned we were basically trapped in our room and couldn't leave, we missed two shows we had paid for on Thursday  night, and reversing room service charge seemed like a reasonable request as did reversing one room night.  Nope.  Not without a fecal sample.  So while I am finally feeling back to usual as of yesterday - nearly 7 complete days later - my girlfriend is still not feeling well.  I asked if I could speak with someone else as I really could not believe this was his stance and he said no - he was it.   He actually said that we should have gotten the water, ice and 7up ourselves, which I replied we had thought was a really bad idea since we couldn't stop the bodily fluids from coming out both ends and thought that would be bad going up and down the hallways.   I calmly told him I would definitely be escalating this and writing on line reviews warning others about this horrific customer service and I was told to be careful, they take liable very seriously.......
This hotel is awesome. My boyfriends dad bought us two nights in the Rush Tower and I have to say I was very impressed! First off the all the staff members were very friendly and helpful. Our bags came to the room fast and when I called for a wine opener It came to the room very quickly! (I like fast and friendly service). The room was amazing and spotless! even though we were only on the 8th floor we still had a view. The bed was heaven. I loved that there was a huge area for me to get ready and do my makeup at. A big bathroom is always a plus as well! Theres a few places to eat in here so we didnt even really leave the hotel because everything we needed was pretty much in the hotel. . . Every hotel I've stayed in has always had some kind of disturbance in the middle of the night or early in the morning, I was so happy we didnt have to deal with any of those at this hotel! Its hard for me to sleep/relax with my medical conditions so being woken up in the middle of the night always pisses me off when I stay at hotels. We couldnt hear any noise in our room and it was so peaceful! I love this hotel and will definitely return for any of my future vegas trips. . . The only downside I can mention is the casino did not seem well ventilated compared to others I've been to and I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke.
Our non-smoking floor was smoky. Even found ash on the floor by our door. Seemed like the air system was bringing some smoke in to the room.  We were in the new, Eastern upgraded tower.  We left a day early- which was hard because the rates were great and the rooms were big and comfortable.. . Enjoyed the regular buffet- it was tasty with many options. Rosie's service was general very slow and sometimes mediocre as was the Rosie's food.. . We chose this hotel for the Atrium and pool.  The pool was not as warm as we'd like, although it was manageable and a lot of kids were having fun. Kids were NOT allowed in the Jacuzzi and this was a big disappointment for us.. . The arcade was fun, but a little smoky too....
Looks like this place recently had renovation work done and it looks awesome. Cheap gambling and food as well. Crazy how in January they have the pool open. The big slide looks really fun to go down since you slide through the fish tank-- looking forward to visiting here in the summer.
We booked this room at the last minute because we decided to stay an extra day.  This is what I would call CLASSIC Las Vegas!  Definitely old Hollywood Glitz and Awesome!!!  When we arrived we paid extra for VIP treatment...which essentially consisted of bottled water, roasted peanuts and M&M's.  Granted it was an easiercheckin there wasn't anything major that made it worth the additional expense.  Then we get to the FIRST room.  There are no robes as stated on the website.  So then we go to use the bathroom and find what I can only assume is puke or fecal matter all over the bottom of the outside of the tub...OMG DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!  Seriously I was horrified!!!!!!!  Then we go to log on to the WIFI which was spotty at best and find out there is a freakin $12.99 charge PER DEVICE!!!!!!!!  WTF are you joking?!?!?!?!  So we go back down to VIP checkin and show the woman pictures of the craziness we found in the room and she is unable to upgrade us to a suite so she discounted our room rate to $30 and gave us a new room!  Awesome right?!?!?!  Well yeah til we got in the SECOND room and there is GUM on the wall!!!!!  What the actual F????  We go back down and the woman apologized but really didn't seem all that concerned with our problem.  We were able to find a cleaning woman who removed the gum for us but seriously....this place needs to have a serious chat with the cleaning staff here!!!!  Overall the beds were comfortable and the experience wasn't heinous.  It is right on Freemont Street which was AWESOME and a perfect way to end our trip!  My experience at the Nugget ended with a FABULOUS SURPRISE...when we went to check out using the TV in our room our bill was - $ .58....so basically the comped the room!!!  They really did go the extra mile to try and make up for some of the issues we had!  If you are looking for a place to crash, this place is perfect...it is stumbling distance from all the action and for the most part a great place to stay as long as you can get past some of the cleaning problems or get them to fix it for you.
Ok after reading some really bad reviews i was a bit afraid to stay here but i was determined to give this beautiful hotel a chance and boy was i glad i did. Im going to start off with the only downside, when they say 3pm check in they mean it, we arrived Sunday a lil after 1pm and couldnt check in we went and killed time by having some lunch. They called my cell at about 2:55 (LOL) and said our room was ready. It was f** amazing. It was me and my 3 adult daughters, every employee that we came into contact with was nothing but professional and accomadating. We stayed in the Rush Tower Jan. 19th for my bday. They gave us the VIP treatment from beginning to end. I really like that u had to insert your room key to get up to your room, no key, elevator wont move.The rooms were unbelievable, large, clean, modern and,2 sitting areas with large comfy chairs. Bell service, ppl that actually open the doors for u every time u come and go. Our room included a safe, FREE wifi which worked better than at home, fridge, access to the gym etc. Complimentary robes,slippers,kcups,Fiji water,snack bar with apples,trail mix, nuts,candy. The bed was so plush, the pillows were like sleeping on clouds. Nightly chocolates on our pillow. We will definately b back
We enjoyed our 3 nights here.  They have some great restaurants and the location is perfect if you want the Fremont street experience.  Nice staff, but getting assistance on the phone was lengthy both times before reaching someone.
It has been over a year since writing the last review, and I wrote that post immediately after I returned.  A lot happened after.  A week had gone by, and had no response from the Las Vegas Police.  I ended up calling and leaving emails till they responded (took 5 days).They put a detective on the case, and left me a voice mail saying that the Cameras in the hallways are not turned on.  They are actually fake cameras.  Only the casino cameras are working, no surprise.  . . I also wrote a review on Trip Advisor about the robbery.  5 people who saw my review contacted me that they were robbed the same way: While they were sleeping in their room. Robbed on the first night of their stay, because you would be carrying the most amount of cash.  Around a holiday or an event happening in Vegas.  4 of them were on the same floor and tower in a span of 6 years.  All of them did not have a chain lock or deadbolt on their door, until they were relocated to another room.  After reviewing some of my photos of the first day, we did not have a chain lock on our door either.   The Golden Nugget didn't do anything about it, and shrugged it off.  The corporate office also gave the runaround.  . . I had some time to reflect on the incident.  The robbers were professional about it.  They lined our bags by the bathroom door, so they can use the light to go through the bags without it being bright in the room. The room was also pitch black because of the curtains.  The money and casino stubs were in multiple areas.  I found my wallet was on the nightstand, but I do remember leaving them in my pant pocket on the floor.  Which means they were that close to us.  They did not steal our cell phones or credit cards, because they can easily be traced. . . Looking back, after we went to the front desk to report the crime, the clerk relocated us to another room.  We went back to our room to gather our stuff, and became locked out, because they room key became invalid.  We called the front desk, and they sent a security guard to open the door.  She said that she could see the history of the card keys used with her electronic device that unlocks the doors.  She just paused and said "oh..." and opened the door.  I never got an answer, because that's when my girlfriend realized her Macbook Pro was missing.. . I'm not going to make any accusations, but this is a little too coincidental.
Since its renovation, I believe this to be the best hotel casino in downtown Vegas. Best swimming pool by far because its huge and has a 3 story slide that goes through a fish tank! I've not booked a room here but I've partied at the pool during the summer. If you're staying in downtown Fremont during the summer, I recommend checking out the Golden Nugget pool and see for yourself!
After staying at the golden nugget many times over the past ten years I will no longer stay there. . We incurred a clogged sink after a few mornings and reported this to the desk. Upon returning to the room prior to dinner the sink was half filled with sludge after what appeared an engineer attempted to fix it. After again calling a manager engineering again came up to the room and while we went to dinner he attempted to fix the mess. When returning to our room we found the sink still clogged and sludge within inches our toiletries kits. We don't know if some it splattered on them. A note was left to have us change rooms. . All we were offered was a credit for one night out of our four after our health and welfare were compromised.  . . The quality of this hotel in service has continued to go down. We ate at the buffet for dinner on Sunday night and for $24 wasn't acceptable. The main coffee shop on the first floor has been closed for over six months and the hotel has limited places to eat.
