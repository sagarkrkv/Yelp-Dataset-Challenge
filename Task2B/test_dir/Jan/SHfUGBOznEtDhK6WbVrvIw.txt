Been there multiple times, simple and delicious!. A Montreal Must.
Visits: 1st. Rating: 4.5*. Service: very informative, nice & helpful. . Their signature sandwich, Smoked Meat, is delicious. I love how you can choose the level of lean meat in your sandwich. This is a great option for different tastes buds that like the fatty flavor & those that want to eat a little healthier with a leaner cut. Awesome option! There's actually 3 levels from lean, to some fattiness & extra fatty. You can't go wrong with the Smoked Meat Sandwich. Deelish!
This world famous deli has been a staple in the 514 for a very long time, and is no question one of the great prides in the hearts of my beautiful Montreal-ites. Such accolades of course result in grossly long lines at all times of the day.  I just wish I had a better taste experience from my visit.. . Of course, I went for the classic smoked meat sandwich with mustard on (i think) rye. It was good, but not outstanding. I actually found the meat to be a bit on the dry side. Maybe it was because of my pre-conceived notion that it'd be juicier, much like a pastrami sandwich. Not the case in my experience, but I'll be sure to give them another visit when its warm enough to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour, which probably means mid July. . . . *Beantowns Finest*
What can I add that hasn't already been said before?. . When someone mentions Montreal smoked meat, this is the first place to go to but I forewarn you, the bar will be set pretty high.. . There are other decent places for Montreal smoked meat in Montreal but this place is tops.. . Just be prepared for lineups if you're going during peak meal times.
Steve is the best server!  We ordered a pickle and two smoked meat sandwiches.  Since we were New Yorkers, we had to compare their smoked meat to Katz's deli, and I have to admit Schwartz's is better.  . . We ordered a half-pound for a train ride home the next day, and Steve hooked it up. Order lean. The table next to us ordered a steak that looked great and some smoked meat.. . This place is great. A must try.
I went to Schwartz's a couple years ago and it was a fantastic experience to have the original Montreal smoked meat sandwich. The food was absolutely fantastic, everything I imagined that it would be. The sides were perfect matches, and the meat was true to its roots the very definition of smoked meat. The biggest downside were lines were insanely long (almost an hour wait) and the service was rushed.
So, this place used to be my smoke meat HAVEN! And then.....I went today, for my  fat day...and, i was disappointed. What happened? The meat was soo dry...I asked for a medium sammy and there was an insane amount of fat, not that it was bad, but it wasn't to my liking. Very bland and wanting salt...I couldn't tell the waiters it was bad...they are the sweetest bunch you will ever meet, but it's sad that Schwartz's has come to this. Celine Dion don't know good smoked meat, and now I'm farting up a storm. I guess tourists would like it, but IF YOU'VE HAD IT...LIKE HAD IT....U KNOW IT AIN'T GOOD NO MO...NO MO FO SHO.
Ordered two smoked meat sandwiches, poutine, and 1 lb of smoked meat, all to go. Ordered "medium" for the meat. I found the poutine just okay, but the smoked meat was just delicious! Definitely worth the stop. The takeout counter is actually a separate entrance and separate storefront than the diner, just next door. Friendly service - will come again.
I've lived in Montreal most of my life and always heard great things about Schwartz's but never felt compelled to try... Well I'm glad it finally happened although I still wonder what the hype is all about.. . Something about meat, mustard and bread sounds really mediocre and boring to me. Maybe I'm just not a smoked meat kind of person. I've had it just a few times and quite prefer it elsewhere.. coughDunnscough.. . It was good, but not worth coming back when there are line ups or worth the hassle of taking cash out when I'm used to dealing with businesses that accept plastic.
Katz spoiled me. Also my toes almost froze off waiting outside for about an hour.. . Decor/Ambiance 3.5/5. - This place sure has true delicatessen feel to it. Big chunks of meat are visible from the outside. The inside sits a limited amount of people (hence the wait. Don't come on the weekend to dine in, or at least order out). It felt a bit cramped.. . Service- 5/5. - Food came out super fast as soon as we sat and ordered. Despite how busy it was, the guys were efficient and eager to take second orders/ modifications.. . Food- 2/5. - Being from New York, Katz has set the bar ridiculously high for smoked meat sandwiches. Schwartz doesn't come close. This is not to say that its smoked meat sandwich is bad; it is decent. But decent is simply that- just decent. Also the black cherry coke was average. It doesn't help that this place is so hyped up- my expectations were too high. . . . Bottom line- may be worth a tourist visit in the middle of  a weekday.
Note: I am not from Montreal, I have only been here once, so understand that my only qualifications are that a) I'm from New York and b) I love sandwiches.. . So, Schwartz's. Not gourmet. Not fancy. You will wait on line to get in, and then you will share a table with strangers. There is a limited menu. It's fine: there are not that many choices to make, because chances are that you want a smoked meat sandwich. It comes on rye with mustard by default. You should also get pickles and cole slaw, and fries if you feel like somehow you're still low on calories.. . It's a damn fine sandwich. Eat it. Leave happy. Done.
Do you ever have one of those experiences that makes you think to yourself "ok, I can die now, I _____ _____ __ _____." That was the thought that entered my head right after I took my first bite, temporarily lost consciousness due to explicit euphoric state, then came back to. . . And as my dear friend Arc P put it in his review below, "Holy f@$k do they have a wicked smoked meat sandwich!", yes, yes they do! If you travel to Montreal and do not take the time to stand in line at Schwartz's, well, consider your entire trip a failure! I'm serious; these sinfully good sandwiches are like a trip to Disneyland for your tastebuds. And for the love of all that is holy, order an extra pickle! . . Meat Fantastique!
After fighting traffic and circling the block around three times we finally found a spot and made it into Schwartz's for one of their signature sandwiches and it was not a disappointment. The next time I am just going to take the Metro and save myself the pain of parking.  . . I first visited there back in the 80's and have been back every time I visit Montreal. This is a meat lovers dream and I have yet to find a place like it in Massachusetts. Maybe that's a good thing.. . .  The sandwiches are packed with their tender savory smoked meat and I generally don't mess around with the sides like the french fries. I can get those anywhere but the steak and smoked meat are just great.  You have to be ready to take you time and go through the menu and deal with the crowd because it's always busy. TIP: get the coleslaw and pickle with your sandwich...!
Gotta trust the hype when you see 500+ reviews on this place. When you walk in, you'll see the wall plastered with praises and even a musical based on this deli and its smoked meat. A musical?? Yeah.. . The place was packed on 3 PM on a Friday afternoon, and luckily we were seated right away. As the waiter came around to take our order, my boyfriend was originally planning to order the pastrami sandwich, before the waiter suggested the smoked meat was the one to try. His exact words? "After you try our smoked meat sandwich, you won't even want to eat pastrami ever again.". . Was that true? Not exactly.....don't get me wrong, the smoked meat was bommmmb. It was so good, I finished the whole thing and that never happens to me and my small appetite. But some parts of the meat were dry, and I did have to force down a few gulps with water. But it's pretty damn impressive, considering they were able to render such juicy slices of meat just by smoking it. . . I would definitely recommend this place as a place to experience in Montreal, from its old-school atmosphere (complete with ample counter seating) to its variety of deli sandwiches and meat by the pound. This place takes American cash, which is always a plus, and you pay at the counter in front. Happy grubbing!
