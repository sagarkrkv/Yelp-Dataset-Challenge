Well done Bacchanal!!. Been there twice, both times had an amazing meal! The service is also excellent! It is a bit pricey and be prepared to wait in line to get in, that being said it is the best buffet in Vegas!
This is my favorite buffet in Vegas, basically if you there is anything you feel like eating, they probably have it! Everything from fresh seafood to dim sum. This place definitely will not disappoint. .  . When you're ready for desserts you'll feel like a kid in a candy store. . . I ate myself into a food coma and had to take a nap after.
It is not common that I get excited to eat at a buffet, but this one definitely lived up to the hype surrounding it. They have several different styles of food to accommodated everyone taste buds. I started with a plate of meat and potatoes ( Prime Rib, Brisket, and Sausage with Hash-brown and some form of fried potato cakes all were delicious. The next plate was all about seafood ( King crab, snow crab, mussels, crab cake Benedict which were all delicious. For the third plate I decided to go look at the salad bar, it looked amazing, but I wasn't in the mood for lettuce. So, I went in on some Crepes and other sweets. . . . This place is a win, but make sure you bring your wallet.
Probably one of the best places in Vegas to go and enjoy yourself a higher quality buffet.  I have a Total Rewards Card, so I was able to totally bypass the line, to the chagrin of some of the non-card holding folks lol.  But still, great selection of foods, and the the atypical design of "different rooms" for different regions of foods really just make it feel like you're finding more treasure as you go further down the hole. . . Come here early, as the lines get long quick.  I heard someone say that lines were almost 2 hours long...as I walked passed him in the Total Rewards Card line.. . Seriously..get the TRC, you'll save yourself the trouble, and hey you might start earning comps that way.
This is a really good and unique buffet. I can probably forgive the ridiculous waiting procedure they have since the food  exceeded my expectations. Speaking of which: you have to make a reservation at a computer ticketing thing and then they'll text you when you're suppose to get in line to pay.... Then you might have to wait some more depending on how many more people need to be seated. Our estimated wait time was 2 hours.... Ouch!. . We came when brunch was being phased into dinner. For once I had a non-chewy prime rib at a buffet! The selection is interesting ranging from few Indonesian dishes, mini medium rare burgers, and bottled juices and horchata, to smoked salmon and good sushi. I really like how delicious the desserts are (and they were pretty cute too). . . The cashiers and seating hostesses weren't rude but it was obvious they were overwhelmed with the amount of people. The people at the food stations were nice especially the guys at the meat carving area. . . So, in short, I definitely recommend this place as long as you don't mind the wait or price.
Happy New Year everyone! Cheers to 2014 and another memorable year.. . Wowowow... I thought I had my top picks of buffets in Vegas already, but Bacchanal in Caesars is a complete game changer! While my faves are still "Studio B" at The M as well as "Wicked Spoon" at the Cosmopolitan, this one definitely comes close.. . Having just opened this year, this 500+ assortment of food was impressive. The lavish display and large table setting makes for large groups, but definitely come early during all meal times to get seated. Over the Christmas holidays, we were turned away at 6PM due to "hitting capacity!" So we opted for the morning after for Brunch, and it was amazing!. . There was so much to eat that I was pressed for stomach space. From dim sum and Chinese fair made by Cantonese speaking chefs, to assorted nigiri and a grand selection of meats and cheeses, there was definitely something for everyone to enjoy. The large amount of seafood downstairs was also brilliant. I have to echomy fellow Yelper Fanny H. that the shrimp cocktail are some of the best I've had at a Vegas buffet.. . To top it off, there are complimentary mimosas in the morning and they definitely aren't stingy on refilling your glass.. . The only issue we had was because we went in the morning (as well as a mild hangover), our stomachs weren't ready to feast quite yet. Thus, we weren't able to really try the desserts, but there is always next time.
We tried this for the first time after having the Wynn buffet the previous night.  What a difference.  The quality and choices are far more superior.  Like many have said and recommended, this is the best buffet in Vegas right now.. . They even have a ticket system that allows you to not have to wait in a Disneyland line for hours.  Genius.  . . Tip: their "dinner" prices start at 3pm so if you get in around 2:30 you will only have to pay the lunch price and get extra dinner items after it starts, all while saving $10 per person.
We went here because of the fantastic reviews everywhere online about this place, and because it was rated #1 out of all LV buffets.. I can understand now why it was rated #1.  It was a phenomenal spread.  We went on Christmas day and they were packed.  Thank God we went early in the morning to get a ticket for the evening - everyone who had not gotten a ticket earlier were turned away.. We thought because of the ticket we would only have to wait a short bit to be seated, but quite the contrary.  We ended up waiting 2+ hours to be seated.  . But once we got in, it was amazing.  Seafood could have been better, but their asian dished were great.  And the dessert was the most amazing spread I've ever seen!  Go for the desserts and just fill up on those.. Extremely expensive!  we paid $130 for just 2 adults.  . we will probably never do it again, but glad we tried it just once.
Everything looks good. They have food from different countries like China, Japan and Mexico. I was not expecting more options so I'm fine with the choice. And their Chinese food, even without much to choice from the stir fries section, (They have good dim sum!) really taste better than other Chinese restaurants I had before. They are American Chinese edition. . . But, I am from South part of China. The food here to me are too salty. My cousin and I were both upset about the amount of slag they put in the dish. Seems like salt is too cheap to consider among all the condiments. Hope the cool did not drop his Salt bag in the pot. Sigh...... . So after most of the dishes we tried, there is only a "if it is not..." left.. . We do expect more from the price.
Visits: 1st. Rating: 4*. . One of the best buffets in Vegas, if not the best, if not the U.S. For $65 a pop, it better be. She loves buffets, especially in Vegas. Me? Whatever. For that price I can eat at a very nice gastro pub. But got to admit, this place is good. The selection is good & the food is higher end than what you would expect for a buffet. They try to cover all the most popular cuisines in their selections & they do it well. Very impressed with the spread & how good each tastes.
The last time we were in vegas, we went on buffet-hopping and Bacchanal was on the list.. . We tried Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon and the Buffet at Aria.. . Well, after trying all three I would prefer Wicked Spoon over the much-hyped Bacchanal. The only reason it was a 4 stars instead of 3 stars is because of the great service we got from our server. Food selection, quality, presentation and taste is 3 stars though.. . Bachannal does have a lot of different kinds of foods. On the day we were there, however, we saw danishes on multiple different places. We didn't find any macaroons that some other yelper posted on yelp.. . For $51 per person, I came in with a higher expectation than what we had been given. I would prefer to go with Wicked Spoon for $35 and selection, taste, presentation.
Well where should I begin? Great service but a  long assss wait  2hrs. But over all the food was good. The thing i suggest before you start piling up your plate take a walk from the front seafood area to the way back Chinese food area.  My wife and I did not see the other stations until later. We still think the wicked spoon at the cosmopolitan was a little better but that's our opinion over all we had a great time
I rarely go to buffets just because I know that it's impossible to have everything up to par. I kinda felt like that was the case at the buffet there. Certain things were spot on but many of the main disheswere weak. The brisket was great, ribs were cold and a bit gummy & the sausage was too greasy with not enough flavor & also cold. They had some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had & when you added the gravy took it somewhere crazy for me lol! the Mac & cheese was bland. I wasn't a fan of the pasta, but they made great ramen & the pork broth was identical to the soup houses in japan. The tacos were money!! Boiled crab legs were on point & they cut them down the middle which made it a neat treat. I can go on & on but overall it's not worth the wait unless you're really patient and can't decide what you want for dinner lol. It's a step above golden coral if you ask me
Let's start the year off with Gluttony!!!!. . Well, not full gluttony, but a review of Gluttony.  So the Bacchanal Buffet has been touted as being the best buffet on the Las Vegas Strip.  That's a pretty tall order considering the amount of competition they have.  I mean, Las Vegas is synonymous to the word Buffet... or was it the other way around?  Either way, that statement is a HUGE statement.  . . My verdict?  Over-hyped!!! Why?  I was told it's a mind blowing amazing buffet that has huge amounts of variety and great quality.  When I got in, I was presented with a decent variety with decent quality.  I think people see all the stations sprawled out about the walls and think that it's a ton of different variety.  In all reality, I think it's the same (okay maybe a little more) as the other major buffets, but just against the wall.  So when people say it's a huge variety, this was a disappointment.  . . Quality was another thing that was said to be amaze-balls.  Was it great?  No!  The wifey and the in-laws all said it too, "It's good for a buffet".  If somewhere is going to be the BEST of the best, you can't add that"for a buffet" at the end of the statement, that's just cheating!   That's just not right!!!  The seafood station was okay, they had oysters, shrimp, crab legs, the usual fare.  Just nothing stood out.  The shrimp were slimy and the crab claws were poorly cut and had very little meatiness.  . . In all reality, based on Quality and Variety, I'd probably give it a 4 star.  I mean, it is good.  Not amazing, but it is good.  Why 3 stars?  I had to wait 2.5 hours for this.  TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!!  We went in at 4 o'clock thinking we'd beat the rush, nope!  After standing there for that long, after having asshats of people cut in front of us (who gave me dirty looks when i wouldn't move out of their way to cut), it was just not worth it!   The only saving grace for the line was that they had some computer kiosks that the wifey and I figured out how to get to the windows prompt.  Because it's vegas and everyone's watching, i put it almost back to normal.  Everyone behind us thought they were geniouses because they pulled up ms paint and had fun playing with it.  Your welcome. . . To add insult to injury of 2.5 hours of my life wasted in line, the price was insane.  We paid ~$60 pp NOT including tip.  They called it "Holiday pricing".  We called it a rip off since they didn't even have alaskan king crab legs (which i actually didn't mind.  I prefer snow crab).  . . I read a lot of reviews with all the things they had before, and honestly, I think they did what all other buffets did.  Start of with great quality and decent prices. Once you get your name out there, jack up the prices and then let the quality slowly degrade.  That way no one knows the wiser.  Me?  I'll stick to Wynn.. . TL:DR - Over-hyped.
Lesson learned - go EARLY. The lines anytime after 11am are ri-fucking-diculous. They have this convoluted system where you queue up in a line that looks legit but is really just a line to receive your wait time - which is anywhere from 1-3 hours. Soooo dumb. The place is enormous and yet they stagger entry. . . Once inside the food offerings are diverse and very good. You will be full ALL DAY. Service is friendly too. Not super fast, but good enough. Price is worth it but go early and leisurely spread out your meal to 2 hours like we did.
Sorry, Wicked Spoon.  Bacchanal is the buffet to be at in Vegas.. . Aside from The Forum Shops, the arena, and the casino itself, the place to be at in the palace is Bacchanal Buffet.  A friend of mine, and fellow Yelp Elite Ferdinand L., got me and another buddy in here, and it was awesome... Especially after what was the second night in a row of disappointment and terrible decisions in the desert.. . The place is pretty damn pricey, but it's worth it.  The choices are plentiful, and the place is huge.  Each corner of the buffet features cuisine from different parts of the globe, and like Wicked Spoon, the majority of them are already separated by serving size.. . Some of the choices even include contemporary takes on everyday foods.  One of the more interesting menu items was a Mac and Cheese pizza--talk about packing on the carbs.  The highlight here in my opinion is their Asian food selection and individually bottled juices.  It's not just juice either--there's horchata too.  How was the horchata?  Best I've ever had.  It was like having CT Crunch milk.  I literally wanted to pocket like 6 of those Starbucks Frapp-shaped bottles.. . Another tidbit for everybody, get a TRC.
One of my worst experiences in Las Vegas. We came for brunch expecting a good morning. After being seating and grabbing food we started to eat and were dying of thirst because drinks took about 8 minutes. . All the food is super salty. The pork dumplings tasted very processed and store bought. . Pancakes were dried out and crunchy around the edges. . Thai curry chicken was very bland and couldn't taste much curry. . The worst part was going to grab food and when coming back the plates are still all over the table and you have no room to place dishes.
Hands down one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas thus far! The lines for this place is ridiculous but now they seem to have a more organized system. You come check in and get a receipt with a return time on it. Come back by that time and wait in a slightly smaller line to pay for your meal and be seated.. . They have a large variety of food selections. What particularly stood out for me is the quality in each of them. Every single thing I tasted was quite good or at least tasted what it should be like, unlike other buffets where they would be great in one thing and lack in another department. They have one of the best dim sums I've ever tried and their ramen was surprisingly tasty for a buffet-styled ramen. They have all sorts of different drinks including tamarind and horchata. I love horchata so I was so pleased! Their tacos were also amazing. I've tried almost everything they had there. It's amazing, you have to go experience for yourself!. . I believe it's $30 for lunch and $60 for dinner. I can't remember the exact prices. Their dinner time starts at 3pm, so if you come around 2:30pm you can pay for the lunch price yet still be able to get dinner selections! :)
I'm no rookie in the food world.  I have been a gourmet ingredient sales rep for years and have enjoyed some of the best of the best food wise.  I'm an avid hobby cook around my home and have a very discriminating palate.  . . This is THE BEST buffet I have ever had!  So clean and beautifully maintained. Anyone that is claiming that this food is poor has different motives for the review.  Possibly the line was too long or the price was too much for them.  . . Food quality was very good.  I live in LA and it is hard to impress me with sushi considering it's on every corner.  Buffet sushi is always a losing gamble- anyways  figured I was in Vegas so what the hell.  Salmon was soooooo fresh! I had about 9 pieces no disappointments.  . . I should be telling everyone this place sucks.  That way I could disway everyone from coming and adding to the massive lines.  However, great food is my passion and I must shout it from the roof top.
For lunch: Wicked Spoon is better Bacchanal. . . My gf and I came here for lunch. $33/person, about 1.5 hour wait and we got there at 11:30am. There is a line to get a ticket, which tells you when to come back to pay and get a seat. There was an option to enter if it was a special occasion. It was my gf's birthday, so I checked the box marked "birthday" and wondered what special thing would happen. Spoiler: nothing happened throughout our time there, and no one acknowledged it. Why put an option to mark if it's someone's birthday if absolutely nothing will happen when you check it? Anyway, when we got back at our designated time, we had to wait about20 minutes in a line to pay. The group in front of us was supposed to come back 2 hours later (they had just gotten their ticket), but the hostess and cashier didn't care and let them pay and enter anyway, while the rest of us honest folk waited to return at our designated time. At the time of payment, I had to put a tip. This is weird to me, because I like to adjust my tip based on the service provided by the server. The cashier then pointed out to me that this tip would go to my server. Okay, how do they know who my server is when we don't even have our seat yet? . . It was then another 10 minutes after we paid before we were taken to our seat. I put the receipt - with the tip labeled on it - down on the table and after our server asks for what drinks we want she picks up the receipt and looks at it in detail. I don't know why she did this. Like any person would, I am sure she saw the tip I had left. And like any person would do, she probably decided in her mind to give us a certain level of service based on the tip that was preemptively given. Overall, the service by her, the cashier, and the host were poor, but the man bussing our table was significantly more friendly, and brought us ketchup and refilled our drinks for us, and we saw him more than we saw our server.  . . Highlights and lowlights of some of the food:. Maple-syrup tater tots - very good!. Filet mignon - delicious, made me eat all of it even though I was stuffed. Fried chicken - it was very dry. KFC has better fried chicken. Made-on-the-spot carnitas tacos - bland, not exciting. Labels were inconsistent. Some foods had labels, others did not. The salsa bar had no labels.. Sausages - average. The Chinese food - my gf said they did this section well. Desserts - underwhelming. The best I had was the flan. The "thai" gelato tasted like vanilla. There was no honey display.. Overall the presentation of the food was sub-par. If you have been to Wicked Spoon, you will understand the difference in the food presentation.. . I think this place is overrated. Wicked Spoon has a much better lunch buffet, better service, is cheaper, and has a similar ambiance. I would recommend you go to Wicked Spoon than Bacchanal.
Expensive, and kind of overrated. There was a very large selection and some things were good but nothing stood out as being stellar. The oysters were freshly shucked, but not as sweet as those we get in the Bay Area. The other item that people lined up for were the snow crab legs...which is the same thing that is served at Red Lobster, so there's that. . . Please remember that this is still a buffet (even though it's expensive), which means things are kept under heat lamps or over ice on open trays i.e. dry looking sushi. . . Pro Tip: Go early and get a ticket at the kiosk right in front of the restaurant and come back at the designated time. The wait should be less and they will turn away walk up customers at 8:00 because the queue has been spoken for. . . TLDR: Go to an actual restaurant, buy a steak made to order....that being said I loved having a million dessert options and I ate them all.
Great buffet! Tons of choices. Everything we tried was excellent! We went for brunch on Sunday around 10:30; line was reasonable and moved quickly. It was pricey for brunch ($80+ for two), but the available options were worth it. I would definitely recommend. Just make sure to take as much time as possible (they say 2 hours max) & try as many things as you can!
This buffet is awesome but the wait time is ridiculous.  . . They have kiosks now which tell you when to return and what the wait time is.  We got there around 4:15 and they told us that our wait time was approximately 200 minutes.  So we were to return at 7:30 pm!  Man a 3 hour wait is pretty ridiculous especially if you were hungry at 4pm when we actually showed up.  We walked around the Caesar's shops, opened up a Total Rewards card, used my $5 slot play and still had time extra.  We got back around 7:00 hoping to get seated earlier but the line to pay was about 30 minutes long.  Then the line to get seated was about 20 minutes long.  I was getting light headed at this point!  Health danger indeed.  . . The total rewards card gives you a dollar off.  If you are an elite member, like a diamond member, etc. you will not have to wait for this buffet.  They also gave us these little rubber things for your fingers to protect them when you grab hot dishes.. . The actual buffet is pretty great.  They have oysters, crab (warm and cold), prime rib, steak, dim sum, and sushi.  The oysters are not the freshest and one left a weird after taste.  The warm crab is bomb (get it in the italian section not the seafood section).  They are all sliced down the middle so that it is easier to eat.  The dim sum is pretty good.  The char siu is pretty tender actually!  The duck was yummy too.  There was some food that I had to skip over to save room for the best part... dessert!  . . The dessert bar is so fun!  I am a crepe lover so the crepe bar is awesome!  You can put berries, bananas, caramel, nutella, peanuts, almonds, and whipped cream on it.  So good.  There are little cake pops that don't actually have cake in them.  Some are marshmallows or rice crispies.  There is a red velvet whoopie pie, not so good.  My mom really liked the pecan tart.  There is also gelato and mochi ice cream.  Couldn't get those because I was physically stuffed!. . I am really glad that I got the chance to try this buffet but I don't think I will be back because the wait is simply too long!  I was in a food coma for 2 days after this meal.
This was our second time here and we had family visiting from Europe. We went for dinner and the line was very long, but the wait wasn't too bad. It was well worth it by the time we had the food. OMG!! Where to start! . . Let me start off my husband and brother in law were hysterical about the meats, they kept running back and forth for the brisket and sausages. Lol. The brisket literally was the moistest I've ever had and melted in your mouth, it was delicious.. . Everything we tried was very good, and good quality, we just wanted more room in our tummies!
The Wynn used to be my favorite, but the Bacchanal up-ed the ante and pretty much put it to shame. . . The sheer volume of food is impressive, but it's the authenticity and nuanced flavors in each dish that made it an over-the-top experience. I felt like I was taste-testing dishes for a celebrity restaurant. They also had many quality items that the other buffets do not have. Savory examples include fresh steamed crab legs, Indonesian rendeng and goreng, Paella (so hard to do well, but they nailed it!), Oyster shooters. Dessert examples include hand-crafted mochi ice cream (including Black Sesame flavor!), chocolate dipped strawberries, etc. Another cool option was the agua fresca selection in the Latino section - they had tiny bottles of Horchata, Strawberry Juice, Mango Juice, Jamaica, etc. . . I went on New Year's Day, so perhaps it was even more abundant than normal, but it was well worth the price tag and the wait to get in. . . Pro Tip: Check in at the kiosks early in the day so you have an approximate wait time for the buffet (can be up to 4 hours!) and arrive an hour early.
We came here for dinner a little before 3:30pm so we were able to get in before the crowd appeared. The seating was comfortable and there were a lot of food selection! My favorite of the day was kobe beef slider, second goes to prime rib. The chef who handles the meat was very polite and would grill my prime rib to medium well for me. I ate a lot of prime rib and kobe slider that day. The roasted chicken was good. They got a lot of seafood and they look fresh and good, but I can't tell if they taste good due to my allergy. The salad and fruit were fresh and good. The asian food section looks just ok to me, but I wasn't there for asian food anyway so it was not a show stopper for me. The dessert selection was good and tasted good. . . They also got bottled juices next to the mexican station and I tried a juice (forgot the name) and horchata, both are great!. . I hope they keep the quality and don't go down in the future. I am happy with this buffet. We actually got the Buffet of Buffets (BoB) pass and this is our first buffet of the pass. Need to pay $25 extra with the pass and I think it's okay. We hit 3 other buffets with the BoB pass so it's like I am paying only $25 to get in the dinner buffet at Bacchanal.. . Will come back again!. . Note: Our server was very nice and didn't ask us to leave after sitting there for 2 hours. I am a slow eater so I am glad I get to sit there for more than 2 hours so I get to try everything out without any discomfort.
Great googly moogly do I love this buffet. As a Vegas local I like to treat myself to a meal here several times a year. It's super expensive (over $100 for 2) so make sure you are super hungry before you get here. . . I have noticed a decline in the offerings over the years: no more freshly carved ribeye, no more crab claws, no more delicate Italian pasta dishes, and green vegetables have been phased out with more cheap carby sides like corn and potatoes -- but it's still a great buffet with great quality food. The dessert station is a thing of beauty. You can try mochi, homemade ice cream, crepes, chocolate dipped strawberries, cheesecake pops and more. Oh nom nom nom. This is THE place I go when I want to blow my low carb eating plan. On my most recent visit I ate 3 baskets of the sweet potato tater tots all by myself.. . Be prepared to wait in a long line. Try to go at "off" times if you don't want to stand around forever. And Pepsi fans rejoice: no Coke products served here!
How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?. .    A: $54.    B: $74.    C: $94.    D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already. . Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.. . So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. . .       This better be one hell of a buffet!. .             It was. . . Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... . . Meats & Seafood.  - Chilled Shrimp.  - Chilled Crab Legs.  - Warm Crab Legs.  - Rack of Lamb.  - Oysters on the Half Shell.  - Prime Rib.  - Sausages.  - Chicken.  - Ribs.  - Mussels.  - Chinese-style Crab.  - Crawfish. . Sides.  - Caprese Salad.  - Sliced Pineapple.  - Pho Noodle Soup.  - Turkey Pot Pie.  - Charcuterie Meats.  - Cheeses.  - Steamed Dumplings.  - Creamed Leeks & Lobster.  - Sushi Rolls.  - Cranberries.  - Sliders.  - Bread.  - Crab Benedict.  - Chinese Broccoli. . Desserts.  - Fresh Crepes.  - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies.  - Gelato.  - Creme Puffs.  - Vanilla Creme Brulee.  - Chocolate Creme Brulee.  - Buttercream Pops.  - Cheesecake Pops.  - Berry Mousse Tarts.  - Fresh Cookies. . Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.
First Thoughts: "Voted Number 1 Buffet by USA Today." Let's see about that. . . When we arrived at Bacchanal at 11:30 am, we had to wait in a short line for about 10 minutes to get our print-out slip from the automated kiosk. We had to punch in our party size and we were told to come back at our designated time. We were told for our party of 2, the total wait was about 47-58 minutes and we were told to come back to pay at around 12:25 pm. We came back at our designated time and waited to pay--in yet another line. This line took about 20-25 minutes. We noticed the party of 3 ahead of us had a print-out slip that told them to come back to pay at 2:10 pm. It was obvious they had cut the line and judging from their dodgy behavior--they knew it too. My bf scoffed and said they would probably be turned away at the cashier; they weren't. It was utter bullshit that while honest people, like ourselves, were waiting our turns, others could just cut in line and Bacchanal would turn a blind eye. The cashier did nothing and the kicker: they were seated before us.. . When it was finally our turn to pay, the cashier pointed out the tip section of the receipt and so my bf had to write down his tip amount--BEFORE we had been served. This seems entirely backwards to me. Why have your patrons pay for a service they have not received yet? You leave tips based on the kind of service received during the meal--not before. Nonetheless, this left an even more sour taste in our mouths and did nothing to mollify the frustrations of waiting in 2 separate lines to pay. Once the monetary transaction was completed, we found ourselves waiting in, you guessed it, another line--this time to be seated. This line was significantly shorter but it is deceiving since I had assumed I'd be seated after we paid. The hostess took us to our seats and we were greeted by our sever who looked at the receipt. She asked us for our respective drinks and I think we saw her another 2x during our 2 and a half hour meal. Ridiculous. . . As for the food, itself, the quantity and diverse variety is really impressive. I really enjoyed the Chinese section and was pleased that the chefs knew how to speak Cantonese. That's always a good sign! The XO green beans and stir-fry fish were stand-out dishes for me. The "wok hei" was great in both dishes and I went back for seconds. The shrimp har gow had a thick translucent skin reminiscent of some of the best har gow I've had in the 626. The char siu was also very tender and not overly salty and sweet. I went back for seconds (and thirds)! The sweet custard bao was good but my one gripe about the baos would be that they are left far too long in their steamer containers. When they are first placed in the baskets, they are good but 15 minutes later, the soft bao skin gets hard and crusty. Nevertheless, Bachannal has one of the best Asian sections in all the Vegas buffets I've been to. . . Other than the good Asian section, none of the other food sections stood out to me. Most of the foods were unlabeled so even if I did enjoy something, I didn't know what I was eating half the time. We were eating at 1 pm so Bacchanal really has no excuse to not put up adequate signage on their dishes. The Mexican and seafood section seemed to be pretty popular. I thought the carnitas were too salty and I liked the creamy rice dishes from the seafood section. Wish I could tell you what they were but you know, it's kind of hard to do that when the signs were not put up! . . The dessert section was entirely underwhelming. I thought the crepe station looked neat but I was too stuffed to try it. Presentation was not nearly as nice as Wicked Spoon's and I thought the containers full of candy (jelly beans, gummy candies and Hershey's kisses) was a cop-out. I want less candy I can buy from CVS and more gourmet desserts. The gelato was awful. I got a scoop of Thai tea gelato and it tasted like vanilla. When I had ordered the same gelato at Wicked Spoon, the gelato tasted authentic!  . . Also, my bf had taken me to Bacchanal as part of my birthday lunch. When we were checking into the kiosk, they asked us if were were celebrating a special occasion like a birthday or an anniversary. My bf checked "birthday". Nothing happened. No one acknowledged it on Bacchanal's end so why bother asking? If anything, asking the question made us anticipate something happening. We were not pleased. . . Bottom line: Go to Wicked Spoon. For the price of $32/ person for a weekday lunch, the overall food, service and experience did not justify the price or its USA today accolades, for that matter. . . Bacchus would not be pleased and neither was I.
NOM!!! This buffet is sooo goood! They had a good variety of everything to eat. . . My family took a mini vacay trip to vegas and decided to eat at this buffet. We saw the long line which seemed it would take hours to go through, so we opted for the express which was an addition $20. It was soooo worth it. We ate until we all had food babies. I loved the dessert bar with so many ice cream options including mochi!! They also had a crepe station so I put ice cream in the crepes too!! SO GOOOD!!!. . As for non-sweets, the had a great brisket that wasn't dry but really moist instead! It was really good. There was also the lobster with crab on top. It was one of the highlights of my meal. This is a must-go buffet for the next trip to vegas!
Upper end on price but food selection and quality were excellent as well as the service and overall presentation.
As a Los Angeles resident and a person who frequents Vegas quite often, this was easily the best buffet I've had.  The usual top choices for people were Bellagio and Wynn, and more recently, Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. So you might be wondering what makes this so good? Everything. . . Let me start with the entrance. Instead of waiting for 1-2 hours in line, all you have to do is wait in one short line to put your name and number in a computer and it'll tell you when to come back. Our wait was 82 minutes. It told us to come back at a specific time and it even took our phone number to remind us. This is a win-win, you don't have to waste time in line and the casino will get you back in the casino to spend more money instead. . . Then you come back at your time slot where you pay the $41.99 for the champagne brunch. It automatically comes with the champagne fyi. . . Then you wait in another short line until your table is ready. After that you are overwhelmed with where to start. We were seated next to the dessert table and it was quickly drawn to the crepe station. Having gone to Europe in May, I was beyond excited. They crank out fresh crepes for the people and then you put on the fixins you like...fruits, caramel, chocolate, Nutella, whipped cream. The best part was the bananas that were already covered in caramel. I recommend taking the folded crepe they give you, unfold it, put in the bananas with caramel sauce and Nutella, close it, and some whipped cream and more Nutella. . . Then there is the real food. The Asian food was amazing - from the Thai Yellow Curry to the Pad Thai, to the Kung Pao. All perfect. Then they had this AMAZING taco station, carving station with bomb French fries. . . I will say that as someone who doesn't eat seafood really, this place had more than enough to satisfy me. Many of the other buffets make the salad bar, fruit area, and cheeses very prominent but the great thing about this buffet is that they had all of that stuff but it wasn't front and center. They gave more than allotted space to the real food. . . What really stood out to me was how authentic everything individually tasted. Usually when you go to a buffet, they have a couple really good things, but I could honestly say, everything here exceeded my expectations beyond measure. Each genre individually tasted so perfect. I can't tell you how on point the tacos were. . . From beginning to end, it was an experience I'll never forget. . . The one thing I will say is pace yourself, I did not feel good from stuffing myself. I got a little overzealous, but in the end, it was so worth it.
I think I am just a biased person about buffets, but I really didnt find this one any different then others. I do say they have good food, but nothing jumped out and said, "Hey! I am new. Eat me!". hahaha, just saying. . . I hate where the plates are and I also thing the glass is too low that it was hard to scoop the things out without spilling them. . . I waited in line for an hour and  I just didnt feel impressed. Not for that price and that wait. . . But I know a lot of people like it. I just dont think for me that it is worth the money.
More like BOTCHanal Buffet... . Let me start by saying that I don't usually take the time to review things on yelp, because I feel other people will usually do a good job of posting accurate reviews.  With that said, I usually write a review when something is really good, really bad, or I disagree with the majority of reviews.  Here's my review:. . THIS PLACE IS OVERRATED!!!. . I've been to buffets that are 50% cheaper and have the same quality, selection, and better service.  Granted, we had a very responsive busboy and server.  But man, the hosts and hostesses could not count or prioritize to savetheir lives.  We ended up waiting 265 minutes total.  Then when we got to the front of the line, the "joke-stess" called forward a party behind us.  She told us we would only have to wait 2 more minutes, which turned out to be 30 more minutes.  We had to complain to the manager in order to be seated.  And finally, when the rope line was opened for us to go sit down, the hostess miscounted the number of people in our group by a large amount.  Whether for lack of attention or inability to count, they obviously were not running the place competently.  . . Similar to what another reviewer stated, we got to our table to find that there were plenty of open tables that would have accommodated our group.  We also saw that they seated a party with less people than ours at a table meant for 8.  . . O_O. . Ok enough of the introductions--let's get on to the food.. . Many people seemed crazy about the crab legs.  I guess many people go to buffets only for the crab.  I go for everything.  . . Typically, buffet food is a little stale because it kinda sits there for a while.  For the price this place charges, you would think their food would be a little different......  not the case.    this food is your usual crusty-edged garbage that results from being over exposed to warming lamps.  . . The variety of options was also not impressive.  Even if there were items that are not normally at a traditional buffet, people didn't choose them.  They just remained in the heating lamps drying out.  My guess is that there is a reason some dishes are not typically served at buffets.   . . Overall, this place felt on par with other buffets that charge around 20-25 dollars.  . Save your money, time, and the headache for something else!!. . P.S.- BE PREPARED FOR ANNOYING PEOPLE TAKING CELLPHONE PICTURES OF ALL THE FOOD.
The line here is ridiculous.. LIke crazy long and then once you pay, you get into another line to be seated.. . Tis the life of a Vegas Buffet. You would have to come during super off hours to even remotely avoid an insane wait.. . Bacchanal is littered higher quality than normal buffet fare. When I say littered, I mean like the back of a girls' 2-door car. There is such an insane large selection, you would be crazy to attempt to try even 1oz of each item.. . With that said, I don't particularly think that all the food is ASTRONOMICALLY good, it's just for buffet food, everything is good. Tack that on to an absurd amount of offerings and I can definitely be a fan because of the selection.. . Macarons are here! YUMMY, they're not the best macarons I've ever had but for an all you can eat macaron party, this is perfectly acceptable.. . Though, this begs the question again, does any Las Vegas buffet have King Crab legs? Because this place was devoid of any.
If you want to eat here, you're going to have to plan your day around it definitely.  . . I love their inventive ticket kiosk system; its much better than your traditional line.  First, go to a kiosk and enter in how many is in your party.  A ticket will print out with a time; that time is when you can go stand in the waiting line to pay and then enter the buffet.  Be prepared, it may be a few hours before you can stand in the pay line.  But what's great about having a ticket is that you can gamble, shop, etc instead of just standing in line.. . Once your time is up and you get to stand in the pay line, you might have to wait a bit more before you get in.  On a Friday afternoon, they told us that after a 3 hour wait, it would be an additional 40 minute wait in the pay line.  So we just returned on Saturday for brunch and the wait was only an hour and we got right in after we payed.. . I believe the weekend brunch was $45 and totally worth the price.  This and Wicked Spoon are my favorite buffet places in Vegas.  There's a lot of great Asian dishes like sushi, dim sum, pho, pad thai, etc.  Crab legs are even on the brunch menu! They have the cold ones in the display but if can ask for the warm ones they keep in the back :). . And you better save room for dessert!  There's gelato, sweet crepes, mini cakes, tarts, pastries, etc.  One of my favorites was a fruit cocktail in a mint syrup.  A great palate cleanser.. . A must try!
By far the best buffet I've had in Vegas.. . Definitely the more expensive one too. Has everything you can imagine seeing in a nice buffet plus more.. . Lines can get long during peak times so i recommend going there early or a little later.. . Make sure your hungry to get your money's worth too. Dessert is very good too so keep about 10% of stomach capacity left for sweets ; ). . Good to take friends, date, coworkers, and customers.
After spending 80 bucks per person ($ 20 for express lane) to avoid the 3.5 hr wait, you would think their food or service would be top notch, but NOOOOOO..... They are nothing spectacular to adjust for the money spent..... The lines to get the popular food are long, 15-20 min wait for the meats, have to wait for them to shuck the oysters every time, have to wait for pho because they ran out, have wait for cooked crab legs because they ran out...... wait, wait, wait....... and the kicker is they try to enforce the 2 hour dinning time on us while tables all around us were either empty or not clean up yet. Of the 2+ hrs there, we probably waited another 50 min just to get food, maybe they should worry more about improving their service and food and try to make customers happy... what a rip off...
We came here on Thurs. Jan 2 at 8pm and was told by the snobbish host that they are not letting anyone in without tickets. We told him that we are willing to wait and he said no.  We asked about paying extra for express line and was also told that it was not available. If you want to try this buffet, come and get a ticket like five hours in advance. We met a local couple and they told us they have been there twice. First time when it first opened and one more time recently. They said it is all for hype folks just like any new buffet in Vegas. I'm frustrated that they turned us and so many other people away.
crazy line! Expensive! . The food was amazing. Lots of seafood choices.
By far the best buffet I've been to in all of Las Vegas, & I've been to more than a few.  Everything about Bachanal is 5 stars; the scrumptious food, the friendly & accommodating service, & the comfortable ambience.  My only regret is eating here on our first night in Vegas the last trip.  After that, no other Buffett could compare.. . Many, many selections from all parts of the world await you, & the host takes you on alittle tour so you can see what's available.  I thought this was a nice touch. . . A few of my favorites were the snow crab legs which were conveniently cut in half, eliminating the need to crack them; the many meats at the carving station, including a tender, succulent prime rib & a flavorful brisket; & of course the delectable desserts, all freshly made by a French pastry chef. . . Can't wait to return!
Best buffet I've been to. The food was really fresh and presented so cutely!  It wasn't your everyday buffet food. Most of the items were imaginative and all of it was tasty. And that DESSERT TABLE...omg. . . Dishes were cleared quickly, servers were friendly. Price was reasonable, lines moved at a pretty good pace. Decor was gorgeous, with different themes like wood and glass. . . I'm trying to think of a con...um...The lights were kind of dim sometimes...?
Amazing!!! Amazing variety and excellent food definitely worth the money not in even in the same bracket as other Vegas buffets!!
CLAMS. CHOCOLATE MOUSSE DESSERTS. GELATO. FRESH PASTA/LASAGNA. CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRIES. Are you salivating yet?!. . These are just a few delicious food options they have at this glorious buffet. The design is beautiful and so contemporary. The guys that work behind the counters are really friendly and funny. Almost everything here is decadent and amazing. Totally worth the price..you're in Vegas, baby!. . Admittedly, if you are the type of person who can only eat one plate a food, this probably isn't the buffet for you. I think I ate like 6 plates that day...maybe even more. I couldn't get enough of the dessert bar. The gelato here is not that great though, Rio's is much better. They do have macaroons which I know people love but I'm just not a macaroon person. The things I couldn't stop eating where the chocolate desserts, clams, and fresh lasagna. MMM MMM MMM!. . and it is included with the buffet of buffets pass but you have to pay a little extra to eat at this one.
They say variety is the spice of life and this place delivers.   Wonderful atmosphere however the music is a little loud for cross table conversation.  . . The hot or cold crab legs are already split so you do not have to crack it yourself.  They also have a wonderful little drawn butter dispenser. Shrimp were large and wonderfully delicious.  Oysters on the half shell, mussels, all presented well.  Lamb chops that were cooked to perfection and wonderfully prepared.  Prime rib you can cut with a fork.  Excellently seasoned clam chowder.  Meatballs, pasta, cheeses, breads, pizzas, oriental, Japanese, sushi, there is literally something for everyone...   And I haven't even mentioned the dessert yet. Carrot Cake, flan, cheese cake, custom made crepes, Apple pie, ice creams, red velvet, tapioca, key lime pie, and more.   But this is not your typical buffet, some of these items are better then high end restaurants.   Everything was fresh, well stocked, and frequently tended to when little messes were made on the bar. . . It was a huge buffet and if you don't go around the corner you may miss a lot of stuff.   I think for lunch we spent $32.95 and the dinner is $15 more they told us.    We got in right before dinner time. . . I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
Came here based on a recommendation made on Yelp.  This is a new buffet at Caesar's Palace and looks like they spent a pretty penny creating this place.. . I waited about 25 mins in line and noticed there were a lot of young 20-something asian kids.    To me that was a good sign as my fellow yellow brothas and sistas and I have similar food tastes (haha generally speaking).. . I sampled the goods before I committed to anything and surprisingly a lot of the food I ate was pretty good.. . The woodfired pizzas were actually surprisingly good (I mean who the freak eats pizza at a AYCE buffet?).  I also sampled the prime rib which was cooked well and to my liking.. . Even the fried chicken was pretty good.. . The dessert bar is amazing here... you can eat everything from gelato, to cheesecake and they even have freakin jelly bellies!!!. . My fellow asians and I were hoarding the crab legs as well... . . This buffet costs about 49 for lunch and is more expensive than your typical AYCE LV buffet but the quality level is definitely a notch higher than most.. . My only gripe is the crab legs weren't as good as other buffets... just my 2 cents.
Did you know that there's a 2 hour limit for this buffet these days? It's written in fine print on the bottom of the receipt. My lovely waitress had the opportunity to inform me of their rule as my family of 8 enjoyed our 4th round of champagne. Then she trotted off smiling like a goon. . . Hm... What does one say to that?! . . Regardless, Ireally enjoyed Brunch@Bachannals. There's a huge Asian section, and it's actually not bad. Dim sum, chow fun, made to order soup noodles, which includes an assortment of rice noodles, udon, flat noodles and egg noodles. Made to order omelette bar. And a pretty good spread of sushi. . . I really enjoy their Mexican section because they have these juices, horchata, watermelon, tropical, mango... ALLL FRESH! . The seafood section was meh, good Alaskan crab and cocktail shrimp but for $46 for brunch, guess I couldn't expect more. . I wish they had some type of beef or just freshly cooked chunk of meat for lunch. . . Complimentary champagne and mimosas for brunch! Not sure if it's all the time though as I went the day after New Years.
wow!!! best buffet in vegas so far. like how you enter your info for the ticket and come back to check in via sms, and wait wasn't to bad. said 2hrs,but luck was on our side i guess so we checked in about 30-40min. . . i was very pleased with the option of hot king crab legs. most buffets do cold, and it gets boring. oh, and their black pepper saute rock/dungeoness crabs are a must!!!!. oysters were fresh and sweet, cocktail shrimp plump and sweet. . . a must for vegas again on my calendar next year
By far best buffet I've been to in Vegas. It was $90 for 2 people but it's worth it and it came with unlimited mimosas!! . . They have all types of food and the quality is amazing. They have this sampler plate at the meat carving station that I definitely suggest.  Foods range from seafood to dim sum to American food.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was I felt the pad Thai noodles were a bit dry that's all.. . There is a wait depending on when you go.  We went around 1250 and it was an hour wait.  But the cool thing is you can leave your name and # and theyll text you it's your turn to sit! It's awesome! . . Oh and they take your picture before you sit too and you have the option to buy them. 3 pictures and a case for $35. . . Definitely a MUST GO buffet here!!
Great remodel on the old Ceasars buffet! I was able to use my points from my players card and didn't know that my card works as a front of the line pass woohoo bonus!. . We were able to sit close to the buffet where multiple trips would not be too far to trek. First of all I have to say, anything with free flowing champagne will be a good time. There were the usual stations of Asian, American, Mexican food with fresh juices and fruit and pastries and desserts. I can't say there was any one dish that jumped out at me, but I could say the selection was something to brag about. The carvers had a selection if prime rib, slabs of bacon and turkey. Asian food was so much to choose from it was like a Chinese buffet restaurant all on its own.. . There was a mini juice bar serving horchata, pineapple, mango, agua fresca etc.  this was next to the street tacos maker guy. There were tater tots in these mini deep fryer baskets-super cute. I didn't have enough room to try the cheese station, but that section looked appetizing. I'd have to be here for hours to try everything! I kept it simple at the dessert area and just had a simple fruit crepe with whipped cream. Perfect ending. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
It really is the best buffet I have ever been to. The quality of food is very good, and the selection is ginormous. We came for Sunday Brunch and were very happy. They have more than one giant room full of stations. Our favorites include: the crab legs, huevos rancheros, waffle bar, omelets, make your own crepes, and bottom-less mimosas. . . It is pricey, but hey, it's Vegas. It's too bad you don't get a to-go box to make up for the cost. Overall, it's a great option.
This is by far the best buffet ive ever been to. Atmosphere is great and the decor is amazing. Their food selection is unbelievable they have everything. I stuffed myself with their prime rib and crab legs so didn't really get achance to try all their different food but i took little bites from my gfs plate and everything was amazing.. . Tip: at the seafood station ask the cooks to give you fresh steamed crab legs and they take a plate and fill it up for you out of the pot super fresh.
I could spend days at this buffet! So many options and all the food is so tasty. The crab legs, wontons, tacos, and dessert were my favorites. This is a definite must do when you are in Vegas if you want to try a great buffet.
Honestly, this buffet disappointed me. It definitely did not live up to the hype. The wait was ridiculous (you have to grab a ticket around 12 PM to get in for dinner, then wait another almost 2 hours to be seated), and it was pricey for the food it offered. . . They had some good food, but I was hoping for a little more in their selection of sushi. It left much to be desired, to say the least. The crab legs were alright, and the shrimp cocktail tasted a little odd to me. I really loved the desserts, pasta, potatoes, and juices in those cute little bottles, but those things were not worth the wait or the price. . . Our waiter was very nice and talkative, so I enjoyed that. . I probably will never be back for this buffet.
There is a new "Fast Pass" like system for busy days. On weekends and holidays, you need to first "check in" at. Kiosk to receive a return wait time for the entire party to wait for a table. They text the lead persons phone when a table will be ready. This allows your party To go to the forum shops or gamble while you wait instead of wait in line. One bad thing is on super busy days  expect to get a pass time only to return 2+ hours later. Try to call to see wait time if anything. . . The food is still good and the service is also still very attentive! Kudos for maintaining food and service quality!
I have been waiting to go to Bacchanal for over a year now. Just recently celebrating their first birthday I have heard such great stories. Some of my favorite buffets before entering this one were others regarded for being "upscale" or "fresh" like the Wicked Spoon (Cosmo) or Studio B (M).  Bacchanal did not disappoint. . . I was scared about the wait for the buffet. They close at 10, and I was arriving at 7:30. I expected a 90+ min stand in line. Instead I got to walk up to a computer stand, input my phone number, and print out a ticket to come back and pay / wait for my table. 9:02. The time frame was right, but I got to spend the time relaxing and not in line. Presumable this is so that they can let their customers gamble and make more money. I enjoyed the free bench at Starbucks and stayed entertained with conversation with friends. Going back to line around 8:50, they let us in early to pay and sit. I still had to wait a solid 15 more after paying to sit. . . Sitting down I was served a drink and bolted to the buffet. It is only one side of the floor, but it is huge. I read before over 500 items, which is probably somewhat accurate if you count each individual label for honey and bread. Starting with ramen and ending with hot crab, I went back to try almost everything. Unfortunately I did not get to eat a mass quantity of any one thing, but got to try most things. I was delighted to actually enjoy almost every dish. Every dish I tried I probably could have eaten as a full course.  . . Many plates of prime rib later, the BBQ section was hands down the best, I made my way to the colorful array of desserts. By this point in the night a lot of the gelato was gone, but I ate a bunch of mochi balls, and a multitude of little plates. . . I loved the food. My only criticism has to be the price. Were this buffet 10-5 dollars cheaper it would be the best buffet, hands down, ever, period. I feel like you can get a similar level of quality at the M, but at the end of the day the price (and overall quality of food) is better here at Ceasars. I will have to be a repeat customer. It is just that 2013 was the year of the Bacchanal in vegas. My front desk man at the Riviera told me that they even closed their buffet because of people wanting this high quality expensive option like the Bacchanal. I hope that this trend continues and buffets in vegas all come to this quality.
This buffet definitely lives up to its hype. If you have the time it is worth the wait, or if you have the cash it is worth paying to jump to the front of the line. Really, if the line is less than half way to the back of their waiting area, it's probably worth waiting rather than paying extra, but I suppose that depends on your means. . . There's definitely an extra edge for the seafood lover, but the creative mixture of dishes offers something for everyone's pallet. The presentation is excellent with individual platings for most dishes. . . They are not the first thing that you will see or hear about, but the freshly squeezed juices must be tried.. .  The lunch and dinner options future fresh oysters on the half shell along with muscles and a variety of other fresh sea foods. The sushi is of decent quality, along with a good variety of other unique Asian dishes. The cheese spread is only so-so given the exceptional nature of the remainder of the buffet. . . The dessert bar is excellent, with particular highlights on the crepes and gelato. The self serve candy station adds a fun touch.
Vegas is a mecca of food... and this buffet alone boost that they have other 500 items for you to gorge on! I don't know if there really is 500 items and I don't plan to count them anytime soon... but this buffet does have a HUGE selection! And seriously, like everything I tried was good!. . I've been here several times and it's hard to say if this buffet is better than Wicked Spoon. I think they are pretty much head to head and I guess it would come down to personal preference as to which place has more foods you like to eat. I've been to both buffets several times and even I can't decide which I like better! As far as the Studio B buffet at the M hotel that is also raved about, I think that buffet is nowhere to compare to Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. I've tried Studio B buffet - I didn't like it much... . . Anyways, this buffet feels very open, airy, and the lighting is good. When you enter, cold seafoods are to your right, followed by American food, hot meats, Mexican food... follow the corner and you will hit the Italian, salads, and Asian food sections. You can order and customize tacos, pasta, and Asian noodles. They even have honeycombs here! The desserts here are also very good and I always take a gelato cone to-go!. . As far as prices, this buffet is the MOST expensive of them all!! Dinner is a staggering $51 and lunch is $32. If you have a total rewards card, it will take $1 off the price and give you some tier credits as well. I've never experienced a line here, but from what I read, the line can be horrendous... maybe I've just always gone at the perfect time! During breakfast/lunch, they have fresh squeezed juices which taste amazingly fresh! The only difference I've noticed between lunch and dinner were the cold seafood... since I'm not a fan of cold seafood, it's not worth paying an extra $20 to me. If I wanted to gorge on purely seafood, I would just go to the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio which is $45 because they have HOT seafood, including all the lobster tails you can stomach. Service here is good and they clean your tables fairly quickly. . . NOTE: This buffet is NOT included in the Buffet of Buffet passes. Breakfast is extra $15, Lunch is extra $20, and Dinner is extra $25. I've done the buffet of buffet pass before and I don't think it's worth it to use it here and pay the surcharge. Just use the buffet of buffet passes to it's full value at the other buffets and come here to eat another day. . . I think this buffet is definitely worth the try! I've gotten many people to fall in love with this buffet after trying it. I think by a small margin, I would say that this buffet wins when it comes to the Bacchanal vs Wicked Spoon buffet. It's like saying one got an A++ and the other an A+. Both are spectacular buffets. Wicked Spoon is however the original master of this new way of buffet - high end foods in small portions. If price is more important, than go with Wicked Spoon, dinner there is about $40.  I think that I would say that Bacchanal wins barely because they have a larger selection and a slightly more upscale feeling. They also have candy in candy jars! I can't wait to come back here and eat again!
Overhyped.. . Only word that came to mind after dining here.. . We lucked out and there was no line to get our name on the waiting list.  After that we waited two hours.  Gambled and drank for awhile and finally checked back two hours later.  We were brought in and seated in the back corner by the Asian foods.. . I was expecting my mind to be blown.  My girlfriend and I had been waiting since July to eat at the Bacchanal, so maybe we were expecting too much?  Everything seemed... meh.. . My cuts of meat were 80% fat.  Perhaps I just got unlucky with my cuts?. . To be honest, I enjoyed the buffet at the Wynn over the Bacchanal.. . Big plus for the Bacchanal was the dessert section.. . I'd pass on the Bacchanal next time I'm in Vegas.
Wow this was a terrible buffet. Are good reviews coming from drunk people??? Many dishes were salty and disgusting including the polenta, scalloped potatoes, and mushroom soup. Decent items included the beet salad and sweet potato fries. The crab rangoon was ok and the vegetable egg roll wasn't bad. The spanish rice was meh. Macaroni and cheese was nothing special. The one good thing about this buffet is the crab legs. The snow crabs were awesome, especially when you get them from the hot food area. Don't eat them cold!  Sushi had too much rice, fish didn't taste fresh. The dessert was horrible. Crepes were floppy and didn't have a nice crunch to it like other creperies. Whoopie pies were dry and too sweet. The little cakes were bland and dry. The chocolate mousse was surprisingly not sweet enough. The tapioca had a bitter orange layer on top that tasted worse the more I ate it. Even the souffles which were recommended to us by our server came raw in the middle - I'm really sad we waited 10 minutes for them to cook. Obviously they didn't cook long enough. Overall, we overpaid yet again in vegas for mediocre to bad food.
"A feast worthy of Gods". . Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.  . . Admission Price. *Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99. *Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99. * Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99. * Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends . * Holiday expect to paid $10 more.. * Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off.. * Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.. . Atmosphere. The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.. . Customer Service. We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine, . . Beverage. You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.. . Breakfast. The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place. . . Seafood. At this price they don't had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I've tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn't good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.. . Noodle Section. Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.. . Meat Section. I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn't good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.. . Dessert Section. They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Creme brulee was too watery.. . Fruit and Salad. They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won't get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.. . My 2 Cents. To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn't get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.
Second or third time here but I didn't think there is anything left to post about this (or any Vegas) buffet! It's one of the best ones if you like to eat till you literally can't get up, lots of choices of food, different flavors each with a lot of options, it doesn't matter from which part of the world you come from. And then there is dessert, if you really want to put a nail in your coffin. The wait is about 1-2 hours, the price is $57/person and the drinks are extra.
Bacchanal definitely raised the bar on Las Vegas buffets! Lots of variety from raw seafood (awesome oysters!) to made to order tacos to wide variety of meats at carving station to the endless variety of desserts. This place is definitely a buffet lover's dream come true. . . We heard about the ridiculous 2 hour waits from other people who have visited before and we also know of the $20 per person line pass available to those who don't want to wait. So we were prepared. A group of 6 of us went on Friday at 6pm. We were told the wait was 1 1/2 hours, which we were prepared to wait. But within 20 minutes, we were paid and ready for a table. After paying, we waited about 15 minutes and we were seated. Don't know whether the 1 1/2 wait was trying to scare some people off, but good things come to those who are patient! . . Our waiter came by to take our drink order and handed us these silicon finger holders to handle some of the hot plates on the buffet line. Once we gave him our drink order, off we went to the awesome buffet! . . I really enjoyed all the variety of food and cuisine. And the plating and presentation of the dishes were a lot fancier than other buffets. There's so much to choose from, so remember not to fill up too quickly on one thing! . . The buffet station is every dessert lover's dream! There was the typical gelato, crepes and cakes you find at all buffets. But Bacchanal went above and beyond. They even had mochi ice cream, cake pops, flavored marshmallows and macarons! So remember to save some room for dessert! . . Overall, I think the price is justified given the variety of food and the decent quality of everything. However, I don't think a 2 to 3 hour wait or paying extra $20 pp is worth it.
It's a fun place, good atmosphere but that's all.  There's a wide selection of food but most of it wasn't really good.  I could go again but next time to eat the seafood only.  I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet. This makes for a good lunch spot tho.  It seemed like the beef and lamb chops were sitting out all day, which they most likely were as in most buffets.  The sushi was dry and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I give it an average rating.
Time and money are definitely worth it here. Me and my bfs wait time was about a good 266 minutes and it's about 54 dollars each person excluding the tax. . . . They have almost everything you can think of here. There's the seafood section, Italian, American, Mexican, Asian and dessert. I'm a small girl but I made sure I devoured the whole buffet making it worth 54 dollars. . . I can't even describe how good or what kind of foods they had. You just have to try it. . And the only thing I can describe are the  desserts. Omg there were macaroons, cheesecake, mochi, gelato. Everything, I was in heaven. . . Someday when I'm back in Vegas I'll devour the this buffet again. Also they take a picture of you before you eat as a souvenir. Which was also pretty cool. Memories of how I gained 10 pounds that night.
Okay, how can anyone not love this place???. . Came here for lunch on a Thursday - around $101 for 3 people. If you have a total rewards card (free to sign up) you can get a dollar off per person. I got my money's worth within the first 20 minutes when I inhaled a dozen oysters. Their cocktail shrimp were relatively larger than other buffets. . . They had a Mexican section where you can order and wait for fresh made beef, pork, or chicken tacos. . . They had a salad bar with actual fresh fruit - not all soggy tossed into a bowl, with more fruit being piled on top. . . They also served noodle soups - your choice of ramen, pho, or udon. I had the udon - the broth was on the sweeter side but nonetheless it was still hot and soothing. . . I was extremely impressed by their sushi section. It actually tasted REALLY good! Considering that I've been to dozens and dozens of different japanese restaurants and had sushi at other buffets, Bacchanal's sushi was definitely above average. On a sad note, they only had tuna and salmon. They had Philadelphia rolls - fresh. Shrimp tempura rolls - still crunchy, not soggy. Veggie rolls - didn't bother with those. . . They also had a thai section!! Pad see ew, pad thai, papaya salad - YUM!. . They had Chinese at the end, but couldn't get around to this point. There was also an Italian section with pastas and pizzas that I decided to avoid to save my stomach for desserts.. . Cookies - stale, so dipped in coffee. Macaroons - pretty good, somewhat soft. No chocolate covered strawberries :( There was ice cream or gelato, ice cream sandwiches, but was too full to try these as well. . . Hands down BEST, BIGGEST, BUFFET in vegas.
Amazing Buffet! Went here for dinner and just the way they serve the hot crab legs was amazing! My favorite area was the seafood. Being from the south, I've had better BBQ but everything else was so delicious. Quantity meets quality here. The dessert area had fresh gelatos, macaroons, and a bunch of other sweet goodness.
My first buffet in Las Vegas and I have to say I was pretty blown away for $30. The seafood selection was ok, but everything was of great quality and not over salted. I enjoyed the fresh juices (Tamarindo, Orchata, Mango, etc.) and the bbq selections. The prime rib was perfect and so was the hen and spicy sausage. I also had some shao mai (shumai?) and ha kao. I was also able to squeeze in some desserts and I enjoyed the chocolate creme brulee, flan, and carrot cake. The cheesecake was very mild in flavor and didnt feel right in terms of texture. It was too smooth. I wish I had a bigger appetite to try more since there was Mexican, Italian, and Asian cuisines that I missed out on.. . I'd come here again if I people wanted to try it, but otherwise I'll hit up the next buffet to see what others have to offer.
In a nutshell, DO IT!  I've been to plenty of buffets in Vegas and I was really surprised with the great quality and the vast variety of food of the Bacchanal Buffet.  Make sure you recon the buffet areas first and prioritize the locations that have the food that you want.  Don't forget to hit the high value targets (seafood, sashimi, crab legs, steak, prime rib, desserts, etc.).  I was surprised that when I went back for seconds, the kitchen had swapped some of the menu items for other great looking food, so it was hard to keep track of all the different stations that I wanted to go to.  My group ate heartily and we all agreed this is one of the best buffets to go to while in Vegas.  We didn't even have to battle the other patrons for the monster Alaskan crab legs or for the other expensive seafood items.  Even with a graduated price scale that correlates to time of day and day of the week, the most expensive time slot (weekend dinners) is well worth the price and experience.
I can't comment on the food because we didn't get in. We got here at 5 PM, added my name to the virtual waitlist system and my ticket said I had a wait time of 139 minutes and we should come back at 7:18 PM. Wonderful! Except when we came back at 7:18 PM, there was a ridiculously long line with a rude hostess. I asked her how long the wait is and she said 1 hour. 1 hour??? What in the world is the point of the virtual waitlist system then? I told her we had a show to attend at 9:30 PM and she said well that's your problem. Nice. I hope the food and wait is worth it for $55 per person. We left.
My second favorite brunch after sterling. Kind of hard to compare the two since one is based on very high end ingredients and other is just on a huge selection.. So after waiting on line for literally 2 1/2 hours, we finally got our table. We did a quick tour of all the options and selections and were somewhat overwhelmed! The seafood selection was great, along with the grilled meat selections. Come to think about it, everything was amazing. Not sure if I would endure this long of a wait again, but a line less than 30 minutes you can count me in.
No wait for lunch on a Saturday?!? impressive! The best thing I ate here was the pho. Not to sound crazy, but it was the best, most delicious pho I have ever tried in Lost Wages! haha!! But in all seriousness, the buffet tasted way better this time than the first time I went in September of 2012. The desserts, gelato, dim sum, crab legs and sushi are my go to dishes. The meats and assortment of sausages were good. Honestly, there are so many choices, it's impossible to eat and try everything! Which is a great reason why you have to try Bacchanal more than once!
If you're looking for a Vegas buffet, look no farther. The Bacchanal buffet has an amazing selection of foods from all different ethnic groups as well as a fantastic selection of desserts. Just make sure you have a few hours to kill so that you can eat your money's worth. You won't be disappointed.. . Our group arrived at 2pm on Saturday and waited about an hour before paying $48 to get in, which included bottomless mimosas. After we were seated, we had noticed that they were transitioning from brunch to dinner, so we quickly scrambled to grab some brunch foods. The Asian foods were all really tasty, especially the dim sum type foods, but the sushi was average and the different fried rices/stir frys were good but not great. Moving on to the proteins, the prime rib was cooked to perfection, the steak tacos were great, and the sliders... oh man those wagyu beef sliders are game changers. The seafood selection was pretty extensive and the oysters tasted fresh, however the cold king crab was subpar in both taste and texture. The crawfish were tasty and the andouille sausage mixed in added a great flavor.. . Onto dessert, the fresh made crepes, the huge selection of baked goods, fresh gelato and assorted sweets were a nice way to finish out the meal.. . The servers were very attentive, constantly bussing our plates and refilling our glasses without needing much prompting.
Bahk-uh-null or BACK-ANAL?  If it wasn't for my friends saying the former, I'm sure I'd pronounce it as BACK-ANAL Buffet.. . We got there around 1pm with a part of 5.  The wait was a little more than an hour, not as long as I thought.  During busy times they'll have a kiosk where you input the number of your party (which includes an estimate time wait).  They ask for your name and number, and they will text you when your table is ready.  Also, you will be given a ticket regarding the information you just inputted.  The texting idea is great because my friends and me were able to roam around for a bit as oppose to waiting in line.. . At 2pm we got our text and headed over.  You check in with the hostess and pay immediately.  Everyone can pay together or separately.  At 2pm it was still the Brunch time and our total ended up being around $48.  The cashiers will give you this little rubber things to prevent you from getting burned when picking your food, but it isn't necessary unless you are sensitive to heat.  They had us wait in another line before seating us where someone asked to take a photo of us.  I later found out, they will try to sell you the picture.  Like really, it's not a theme park so no thanks.. . Eventually another hostess led us to our table.  Because it was our first time, she had the opportunity to tell us where everything was.  As you enter, everything is on the left in the following order: Seafood, American, Mexican, Italian, and Asian food.  The dessert is in the middle-right of the area.  This place was surprisingly not as big as I thought.  When we sat down we immediately ordered mimosas.  Unforutnately, the mimosas were lacking.  As others have mentioned, it did seem like those concentrated orange juice you find in the freezer aisle of grocery stores.  If you let your mimosa sit, you can the concentrated orange juice and champagne separate.  Geez, for $48 you'd think they would use fresh orange juice.. . Finally, it was time to dig in.  I decided to work my way from right to left.  To keep thing short here were some of the highlights for me of each area:. . Asian Food - Chinese food was good (but please, I can get that for cheaper and just as good in Chinatown).  Sushi and the other noodle dishes were on point.. . Italian Food - You can tell the ingredients like pepperoni were bigger and tasted more high end.  Here you also got your steamed crab legs.  If you give them an empty plate of it, they will fill the whole plate with crab legs so brace yourself.  The steam crab legs are worth getting here as oppose to the frozen crab legs in the Seafood section.. . Mexican Food - The tacos were freaking amazing, and they make it for you right there.  On the adjacent part of the mexican section, they have fresh Horchata, Guava Juice, Mango Juice, and Tamarind Juice.  All come in this cute milk jug shape container.  Try all of them!  They were definitely made fresh and sweet.. . American Food - Meat, meat, and more meat.  I gave them an empty plate and asked for some Brisket and Prime Rib.  They literally filled my whole plate with it.  I felt like I needed to balance all that meat so I got a small corn on the cob.  Both the Brisket and Prime Rib were flavorful, meaty, and juicy.  It did not taste as good cold, but there was so much I couldn't finish it while it was still hot.. . Seafood - Muscles, oysters, clams, crab legs, and shrimps galore! All were great, but they kept running out of hot sauce.  People kept taking them otheir tables and not returning them back. Grrrr.  The hot butter is on the corner in the beginning of the line, so don't forget! . . Dessert - I think the dessert area purposely serve small portions because you will be full by the time you get there.  There is someone making fresh crepes for you.  Grab one, pour some strawberries, drizzle some nutella, and add a bit of powder sugar and you got yourself a tasty treat.  Creme brulee was nice and sweet, while they had an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries.  My favorite one was the white chocolate covered strawberries with strawberry coated rice treats.  Lastly, they had ice cream where you can also make cute little ice cream sandwiches with them.  The person scooping your ice cream will ask if you want 1 or 2 scoops.  My friend and I concluded, no matter what combination you say (for example Mango sherbert and Chocolate), she is still bound to say "oh that's a good/popular combination." Haha.. . Overall, I along with my stomach were satisfied.  I would suggest going there around 1pm to get seated around 2pm.  At 3pm, they beging circulating and changing their menu for dinner.  For example, I had the crab eggs benedict during the Brunch hour.  But as soon as 3pm hit, they were no longer serving those items.  If you want to experience everything that would be the best time to go.. . Just remember to pronounce this place correctly.
This was my first experience at a Las Vegas buffet, and I have to say, I'm a fan! I arrived with a group of 5 at around noon and had to wait for less than 10 minutes. The entire area is very classy and our waitress was super friendly. The food is laid out in a bunch of different sections - Mexican, Italian, seafood, meat, cheese, cold cut meats, Chinese, Thai food, and desserts. . . I really enjoyed the soup noodle section - the pho was surprisingly good for a buffet, and they also had ramen and udon, which I did not try. I also went to town on the desserts, the green tea creme brulee was AH-MAZING.. . It was $35.99 per person, which came to about $39 with tax. For the large variety of food available, and in comparison to other restaurants on the Strip, I found it worth it.
Although I was here Friday morning, I felt this place would be best buffet to me so far!. . At this Vegas travel, I visited here and Wynn Buffet. If Bacchanal is 95 of 100, Wynn is less than 70 even I visited Wynn at Sunday bruch when more variety food time.. So I will be here again when in Vegas at lunch or dinner.. . I especially remember the followings.. . - ramen and pho : broth is really tasty, but had to ask less than hafl noodle . - cocktail shrimp : 3 times larger than Wynn and aawwsm quality. - little pancakes: looks good and delicious. - ha glow : small and tasty. - smoked salmon : best I have ever so far. - all other things: more than average
Desert you cant help!! Dumplings and drunken noodles are highly recommended!! The look in my boyfriend's face when we were here was just soo precious. A bit expensive, but I think its worth it. They have a big selection of food and desert with a great ambience. Loved it!!
I definitely think there are certain tiers when it comes to buffets. There's the below average, average, above average, way above average, and then there's Bacchanal.. . I am in Vegas a lot for both work and pleasure and always make it a point to try at least one thing new every time I'm there. I have been to Wicked Spoon multiple times, which was previously my favorite buffet. It is still one of my favorites, but in terms of Vegas buffets I definitely think Bacchanal has the edge.. . First of all, Bacchanal's line is not huge. Maybe I've gotten lucky, but every time I've gone to Wicked Spoon I had to stand in a ridiculous line. The kind of line where you run out of lives in Candy Crush before you're halfway through. The kind where you're browsing into several days ago on your Facebook feed and seeing news you've already read.. . Again maybe I'm fortunate, but the two times I've been to Bacchanal that never happened. Recently they've added a sort of kiosk system where you put in your name, number of people in the party, and a phone number and they tell you when to come back. This is convenient because you can do other things while you wait, rather than stand in line and play Candy Crush or browse Facebook. Heck, you can do those things any time, why do them in Vegas? Go gamble or shop! Then come back when your time has hit and get seated.. . What most, if not all, elite buffets have in common is that they have figured out that guests don't always want these dishes that are simple to cook in large quantities but not that complex in terms of flavor. High end buffets nowadays typically offer small portions of restaurant entree-quality dishes, so you can have a little bit of everything. Bacchanal offers a little bit of everything and then some. Cuisines from all corners of the globe are available at Bacchanal. I am confident that Bacchanal's selection is the largest and most extensive that I've ever seen. They also occasionally have freshly-made juices and beverages like mango juice, pineapple juice, etc., as well as horchata made in-house.. . The food is all excellent quality as you would expect. None of it is bad. The standard that I try to use is, if I got this as an entree at a restaurant, would I be disappointed with it? The answer was no, every time. Certainly there are some dishes which are phenomenal and some which are just very good (saying "just very good" feels odd to me, but that's the caliber of food served here).. . Some standouts in my memory include the truffled scalloped potatoes, and the mac and cheese (I'm serious). I know there were other great dishes but those were the ones that blew my mind. Seriously, I have wet dreams about those truffled scalloped potatoes.. . I will say, I think Wicked Spoon wins when it comes to dessert. I had a large sampling of the desserts at Bacchanal and they were all good, but I was only REALLY impressed with a few. The pecan tart is really really good. The flan is also really memorable - amazingly creamy but not too sweet, almost like a creme brulee. Ice cream is good but unless I'm mistaken, did not seem like gelato.. . All considered, a fantastic experience. Bacchanal is my new favorite buffet in Vegas.
By far the best buffet I've had in sin city. Five stars for the vast variety and quality of food, presentation,service with a smile, spacious and cleanliness of the venue. We got very lucky as our buddy was a diamond cardholder so he was able to walk us right through pass the long line.. . I enjoyed their oyster shooters, beet salad, caprese salad, sliders, sweet potato fries, juices, sushi, soba noodles, salami and desserts! They had a wide range from seafood to deli to dim sum to pho! Since we were in a bit of a rush to head out to our next itinerary, we had to cut our lunch short. I'd love to come back and try everything else!. . Women's restroom is located outside the buffet to your right as you exit.
I have been to a lot of buffets in my lifetime, and I can say that most places that I hear being the "best" buffet are generally 3 star experiences.  Lot's of options with a couple of high quality options, but the majority of the options having flavor and texture problems.  Buffets are generally a whole lot of mediocre food.. . This place is the best buffet I have ever been to, and the next best place is not even close.  For the record I am not considering Brazilian steakhouses to be buffets, I am talking about traditional American buffets.  Almost all of the food here is delicious.  I have only been once, but this place set the standard in my mind of what a buffet should be.  I will go again in April 2014, and hope that the food quality is the same as it was in 2013.  If so then this 5 star ranking will stay and I will tell everybody that this is the only buffet you should consider going to while in Vegas.
Round two! came here for my birthday and I thought the food this time around was much better during the Christmas weekend. Thinking that it would be crowded because of CES, but by surprised there was no line at all, so i think that made the experience a bit better. Then the price per person was much cheaper than holiday price. . . The crablegs again were just snow crabs -- it wasn't any better. The crablegs were all so skinny and NOT meaty at all. . . This time the cocktail shrimps tasted good, nice big plump shrimps. All other dishes were good as well as the dessert bar. The dessert bar is always amazing; my favorite part of the buffet. . . i would only visit Bacchanal during off peak season.
My mom and I came her during a birthday trip to Vegas and although the food was excellent and the ambience/decor was beautiful, I really don't think this buffet is worth the cost. . . We would have had to wait almost two hours if we didn't decide to pay an extra $15 per person to skip the line (which we had to do because we were going to see Absinthe after dinner). The dinner rush was crazy, but our waiter was still attentive and I was able to try everything I wanted.. . I have no complaints about the food and like I said, everything was nice to look at. But for being one of the highest-rated buffets in Vegas, it really wasn't THAT impressive. I feel like it just has a reputation and people are willing to pay so it will stay at the top of the lists but I'd rather eat at the Wynn or Mirage next time.
Worst buffet experience ever!. . Came here on Christmas day with my family. We registered at 3 and got in at 6 pm. As you would think this is rated the best buffet in LV, it should worth the wait, right? Wrong! I've asked the lady at front desk and make sure they serve King Crab legs before we checked in. But later found out they do not serve King Crab at all. I asked the seafood section they told me to check with Italian section. I asked Italian section they sent me back to seafood section. If you don't have it, just tell me you guys are too cheap to serve King Crab, please don't lie to me.. . I tried to find white fish and found they only have salmon. I was looking for sushi and found non of them were eatable. I thought I should at least find tons of fruit at this price point. Wrong again, fruit were very limited. We've tried all the food there and only found disappointment. I think my neighborhood's $11 buffet is better than this.. . I concluded my experience on this trip. Any buffet place crowded with tourists (Wicked Spoon, Wynn...etc). Don't get in there. They will serve you second grade food. Shame on you, Vegas! I miss the old day soooooo much!!!. . If you are looking for quality buffet in Vegas. Don't go for buffet places but go Sunday Brunch (Mozen, Sterling, Fountain...) and get your money worth.. . The one star is for the decor.
You really can't go wrong with this place.  They have a good variety for everyone.  You really get to try cuisines from around the world.  Sometimes the wait can get ridiculous inside and out so definitely remember to be patient.  Came here for breakfast and dinner before which was all a good experience but if you want more seafood, you should come at dinner.  The desserts here are also really good.
First of all the excitement, it is going to be a long wait first. I went first night at 6:30pm, which was a massively wrong decision. Gave up after 1.5 hours of wait without getting close to the gate. Next time we went 2:30pm, still had to wait almost 3 hours and be seated around 5:30pm. So if you are going, be prepared, and that's why it has one star off.. . After the leg soaring wait, the real excitement comes. The place look fancy AND the food is good. Food selection is awesome. Seafood, Mexican, Chinese, Sushi, Italian, ..... you name it, its most likely there.. . Highly recommend the mean section, they have great quality mean with huge selection. Also don't miss the dessert bar, they have macron, super tasty creme brulee and more. Just eating the dessert will get your money back. Worth the money, and Worth the wait.. . If you want to get in quicker, stay at their hotel to get in quicker. Or pay extra $20 for VIP. Just my 2 cents.
I have heard the words "Best buffet in Las Vegas". I try to avoid using this phrase, but Bacchanal Buffet. You had me at hello! :) THE BEST BUFFET in LAS VEGAS!! No Diggity No Doubt!. . Yes, this place is expensive. The most expensive buffet I have ever been too including Brazilian BBQ. Yes, I am cheap at times, but this place is so worth it. I don't mind if other people think it's too expensive, give it a bad rating, and don't want to come here. Good for the rest of us because then we won't have to wait as long the next time we go. Hater are gonna hate. . . New Reservation System!. Type in your party size, name, and phone number in to the kiosk to receive a reminder text when your table is ready. Wow! Thank you so much! I hated my first wait here. It was only 1 hour which is on the low end compared to other people I've talk to. Now I can lose my money in the casino or watch the Seahawks kill the 49ers and go to the Superbowl while I wait. Too soon?. . VALUE. This depends on the person. Some people can eat! I saw a dude hold 3 plates at once. The majority of patrons are really skinny and I don't know where they fit their food, but if they can do it. You can do it! Forget about your diet. Think of this buffet as your Thanksgiving meal in Las Vegas any time of year. I wish it was a little less, but I am sure most people lose more in gambling than the cost of this buffet. I choose food over slots any day.. . PRICE. The price is around $55 person with tax for dinner on a weekend with a Total Rewards card. The price is less for weekdays and lunch time, but I don't know if there are any items not included in lunch. So, I usually get dinner. There is a $20 option per person to skip the line. I have heard this is a rip off. I have never used it but if I had the cash. Why not? If you have a lot of money and your time is more valuable do it. I do value my time not just in Vegas but I can't pay the extra bucks for now I will just wait the 2 hours. . . Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99. Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99. Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99. Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends. . FOOD. I try not use the words "to die for" or "Aaamazinnng!!" But this buffet makes me weak in the knees. I rather eat here than gamble, shop or do anything Vegas has to offer. In fact, Saturday night I was planning the evening and chose this buffet over watching Boyz II Men. I know I will sound lame but I love the Asian food section and bbq section! I know am not eating the most expensive food, but I will eat what I like. I am not a garbage disposal. From the BBQ station get both the pork and beef ribs they are smoked to perfection. Also, I love the Asian noodles, roast duck, bbq pork, and ox tail soup. I never have room for dimsum but it looks good. I don't usually get dessert or crab legs because that's too common in every buffet. I always go with oysters or if I have room the steamed crab legs. .  . I highly recommend this buffet to anyone. I read this buffet took $7 Million to create. So $50 bucks sound like a decent price to live large.. . Note to self. Stay at Caesars Palace already! I have wanted to stay here since way before I was 21 and before the modern Vegas strip was nothing but a dirty road and water spraying mist on your face along the sidewalk. Well Caesar you have given me a reason to live like a roman emperor.
No words can describe how much i love this buffet. It is "The best buffet in Vegas". I came here on two different occasions and i am still in love with this buffet. . . Location is inside the Cesar's, the price for dinner is quite on the pricier side but for the quality of food they serve is definitely worth it!! I've tried many other buffets around Vegas and nothing can compare!!. . What i loved most was their Mini Cheeseburgers served on a Hawaiian sweet bun. I do not like Cheeseburgers but this one got me sold! They were so small, sweet, and delicious, every bite was yummy. . . They also have Lamb chops which i LOVED. Cooked to perfection, nice and tender. . They have tons of variety and their dessert was to die for! They even have different flavors of Mochi Ice cream. ^___^. . This is def. my go to spot every time i am in Vegas!
It was just okay. We paid $45 each for lunch . I thought that the beef sliders were the best thing they had there followed by the crepes. They had a lot of food to choose from but it was nothing great.
There are lots of hypes about this buffet so we checked this one out! The line was crazy! It is totally worth it to buy the VIP ticket to bypass the line. So, first, you need to get in line to get ticket. So it said it would take an hour to have your number called. We thought it should be OK because we could go shopping around. But after that, you had to stay in another line to pay for your tickets and another line to be called. It took us 3 hours and 30 mins to be seated! . . I think the food was OK or a little bit above average but nothing was too special or I had to have it. The fresh oysters were the best I had there. For king crabs, go to Italian section to get the hot and steamy ones. They do taste better. . . I went there once and it is one time deal for me. That is enough!
I finally found the answer to "which buffet do you like the most in vegas?" BACCHANAL BUFFET is where it's at!. . The price for dinner now is $45 so I think it went up a little bit but honestly, you get what you pay for, and the food is really delicious.  . . They have steamed crab legs...yes steamed, not the legs on ice stuff going on, legit.  I also went insane on the peking duck they had...what?! how do they afford that?!  sorry ducks, you just had to get in my belly.. . There's honestly sooooo much to choose from and it's crazy how huge the buffet area is, it feels like it just keeps going. But that's totally fine with me!. . One downside is that they don't have the endless drinks option here so you do have to pay for alcoholic drinks, soft drinks are still free with purchase of buffet.  . . I definitely ate about 10 lbs after this buffet, so needless to say, bombdotcom!
I would have liked to review the food but that would be difficult.  We arrived at Ceasars which is difficult to navigate to begin with.  Arriving in the buffet area we are told to login and be given our time to eat.  We asked if their buffet was still included in the 24 hour deal and we were assured they were.  We waited 90 minutes to be called.  Then we were told it was an additional $30.00 per person to dine there with the 24 hour deal.  The deal was also $15.00 more than before.  So after waiting for 90 minutes we are told to eat there is going to cost 30.00 above what is paid for the buffet deal.  Totally ridiculous.  And by the way - to expedite your space you could pay $15.00 each.  And if you are handicapped - only one person may go in with you - the rest of your party can wait until they are called.
Absolutely worth every penny. One plate of food here is easily worth $60 by itself. Prime rib, shrimp, lamb, glazed hens, ribs, desserts, Chinese food, and Italian are all amazing. My friends were skeptical about spending that much for dinner, but we all left astonished and ridiculously full.
I went there for brunch on a sunday and I didn't like this place it was over priced and the food was sub par. . Service was exceptional tho!!!. Theonly reason I have it three stars is because my mom and gf liked it.
Yes, it's pricey but totally worth the money. This has been the first Buffet that everything tasted great. I was floored by how tasty the sushi was (I had a plateful). I loved the Mexican Juices, I drank my Horchata so fast! The desserts were perfection (minus the red velvet whoopie pie: I don't know what happened here). It was 35$ for Lunch, but really really tasty. Can't wait to try them for Dinner.
Bacchanal = A feast worthy of the gods. . During my last visit to Vegas last weekend, I made a stop at Bacchanal. I called them at 3:15 PM to check the prices and see how long the wait was. The guy on the phone told me it was $50.99 and told me about their new Fast Pass-like system that they implemented for about a month now. It's just like being at Disneyland! Expensive and has Fast Pass! If you're not familiar with Disneyland's Fast Pass, let me explain. You get a ticket that tells you what time to come back so that you don't have to waste your time waiting in line. Whoa, awesome!. . I don't know how and why, but we took a lifetime getting ready and didn't get to Bacchanal until about 6:00. I was happy to find the machines that issued our Fast Pass to return at 7:45 PM. You can even input your phone number so that they can text you 5 minutes before you have to return to the cashier. Very clever, Caesars. I see right through your ploy. Now people have time to gamble while waiting for your buffet! Lucky for me, I actually won three bills from the slot machine while I waited for the buffet. I was alsoable to squeeze in some shopping time during my wait.. . I got a text at 7:40 telling us to return to Bacchanal. A cashier took my payment, which was actually $52.99 per person ($2 more than what was quoted over the phone!!), and told me that the line would take approximately 40 minutes. WTF. Another line??? By this point, my husband and I were starving. The poor guy looked like he was about to faint. Since there were only two of us, we got a seat after 30 minutes of waiting. So, total wait time: 2 hours and 15 minutes. . . As other reviews state, the food is quite good. They have a meat station, seafood station, Mexican station, Asian station, Italian station, salad station, and a dessert station. . . Some things to note about the buffet: . . -I have to make a statement that their prime rib is superb. It's probably the best prime rib I have had at a buffet, and I've eaten at a lot of buffets! . -Their seafood station only has snow crab legs, which you can get chilled or steamed. Unfortunately, there are no King crab legs. . -Their Asian station has porridge and three types of soup: udon, pho, and ramen. Their porridge is quite tasty. I enjoyed their pho, although the broth was a little on the bland side. Two limes fixed that problem. Their ramen was not good. . -Their dessert station has a made to order crepe station with nutella! Yum! They have mochi at the dessert station as well, but my husband said it tasted like supermarket mochi. . -Ambiance was very hip with dance music playing. . -Very comfortable seating. . Overall, Bacchanal still has a ridiculous wait time that is slightly improved with their new Fast Pass system. Their prices are ridiculously high for a buffet, but the quality/taste of most of their food lets them get away with it. For now, this is one of the best buffets in Vegas.
Raw Oysters on the half shell and the workers shelling it were able to tell me what type and kind they were. Tons of seafood lots of fresh food and LAMB! Hehehe. The best buffet ever in Vegas. Plus their macarons were to DIE for! They melted in your mouth with a subtle flavor then flooded you with a strong savory flavor that made me go "Wow"! It's about 50 bucks a person but SOOOO worth it.
I need a bigger stomach. Bacchanal is overpriced and the wait is terrible, but I loved the food. It's not 5-star dining, but it is a fantastic buffet.. . Food 5/5. This is the reason to got Bacchanal: the food. The variety of section is impressive. My favorite stations were theses. - Seafood with crab, shrimp, and oysters on the half shell. - Meat with lamb chops. - Chinese with dumplings, crab, and noodles. - Desserts with anything cause they were all great. . Service 4/5. The people working at the food stations were extremely helpful and in a good mood. Our servers were ok. One host at the register was rude, but once we got past him everyone was generally kind.. . Price 3/5. My husband and I went the day before Christmas for lunch. It was $54 per person and an additional $20 for express. It's hard to get $74 worth of food at a buffet.. . Parking 3/5. Parking for Caesars Palace was free in the self parking lot. We had to drive around and wait for a spot, but eventually found one on the top floor. After parking, it is about a 10-15 minute walk to Bacchanal.. . Atmosphere 5/5. For a buffet, Bacchanal is all class. Just don't forget it's a buffet. People were cleaning around the food stations all the time. . . Good food, service, and cleanliness will bring me back to Bacchanal Buffet. Until then, I need to check out getting a bigger stomach.
Good place but expensive.. . Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99. Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99. Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99. Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends. . Really for a buffet.
$48+ for brunch on a Saturday.  about an hour wait.  they text you a little before your table is ready, so you can gamble while you wait.  that's about the only plus about bacchanal.. . the food was such a let down.  yes, there was a large variety, but nothing stood out about any of it.  i tried a little bit of everything hoping to something that blew my mind, but nadas.  . . wicked spoon trumps this buffet any day.  the green tea creme brule was the only thing i ate all of. . . service was good, though we did have to track down our servers a few times for refills.  honestly, for 50 bucks i'd much rather go to a different buffet.
Beautiful buffet decor. Love the text you when your table is ready.  But why does one go to a buffet at this price? You want amazing food.   T. . he food is plentiful but nothing is great, it's all blah, blah with a side of blah. Sure you get crab legs(hot or chilled) sushi (too warm) dumplings (tasted frozen), pizza (cardboard) prime rib (no flavor) the rest is standard. Fried Chicken, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, blah blah blah.  Nothing was out of the ordinary, interesting or gave me that WOW I thought I would have. If I'm paying this price I want unique, non typical, amazing food. Mediocre doesn't cut it. Sorry Caesars, it's all hype and no substance.. . $58 was the price for dinner Sunday night. Service was top notch. $10 for tip total. $68 for one person.   $$$$
Went here as the first restaurant with my buffet of buffet pass. The line was long but fortunately they have a nice queue system so we did not wait at all. Just checked in, got a text message a hour later when our table was ready. . . This buffet is far better than any of the other buffets included in the 24hr buffet. I loved the shrimp, crabs and oysters. The macaroons were also top notch. Everything I had was above average except for the Asian section. Below average ramen and sushi, but that is expected when eating at a buffet.
Mm.... mixed feelings. Overall, great buffet spread, but if I'm paying $60.00+ for dinner, I expect greatness. So please, excuse me if I sound nit-picky. Verdict: 3.5 stars.. . And since there are so many reviews about this buffet as is, I'm just going to keep things succinct  by listing out the positives and not-so-positives. . . Positives: . + Many stations available: seafood spread (King crab legs, green mussels, raw clams, cocktail shrimp, oyster shooters, cooked variations of shellfish), BBQ-esque spread (cutting station with lamb rack, prime rib, brisket, sausage links; assortment of sides), soup station (chicken noodles), Mexican/Latino station (made-to-order tacos, carnitas, appropriate condiments, beverages), Italian (pasta), Asian-influenced spread (sushi, to-order noodles, dimsum, Thai/Indian, Asian soups), and a salad station. . + The oxtail soup from the Asian cuisine stand was good. Simplicity really is the best. . + Made-to-order tacos were BOMB! Ask them to heat up the tortilla and stuff it with juicy fatty carnitas on your own = foodgasm. . + Glazed cornish hen = bomb. Another point as to how simplicity is often best. . + Desserts were overall pretty good! Please do get that extra helping of gelato. Please do try them chocolate dipped strawberries and the tasty cupcakes. Yummm! . . . Not-So-Positives:. - So many foods yet a good portion of them weren't all that great. Aside from the oxtail soup, avoid ALL other items in the Asian section. I kid you not. Such a disappointment.. - Crab legs were not as good as I anticipated. Partly my own fault because I over-hyped it as I was waiting in line to go into the restaurant... Even if I did go to the Italian stand and ask for hot crab legs, the meat wasn't as fleshy or as tasty as  I would've expected. . - Aside from the prime rib (which was a bit grisely for my taste), I didn't like any of the other meat cuts. Brisket too oily, lamb was flavorful but too hard to chew... ugh. . - Don't get the creme brulee... it had a funky texture to it. Almost custard-like, and not in a pleasant way. . - Salad bar was lacking beyond belief... . . Eh... not worth it in my opinion. Good but not great.
Been here twice now, once for lunch and dinner. I'm pretty sure they have the same things for both so lunch would definitely be better worth your money.. . I loved the crab station and you can take it back near the pastas to be steamed. The truffle potato was incredible and you could pick them up on little hot plates using small rubber plate holders. Sushi was also fairly impressive since I never expect Asian food to be anything worth having at a buffet.. . The dessert station was what made me suppress all my thoughts of imploding. There's a crepe station where you can add on your favorite toppings, and all of the baked goods were delicious. My favorite had to be the creme brulee. Top that off with some of the freshly whipped cream (from the crepe station) and..well I had like a million of those. . . Definitely a place to try at least once in Vegas if you're looking for a buffet.
Really good buffet food.  Almost everything tasted like it could've been ordered off a menu.  The hot n sour soup and some of the asian dishes were subpar.  The meat and seafood stuff here is really good.   We were going to purchase the buffet of buffets 24 hour pass just to go back here but we found out that there is a $25 upcharge to eat here each time so this place is a little pricy but worth it if you can eat a lot.
Bacchanal Buffet, I still don't remember how to pronounce it... Bac cha Nal . . This buffet is located in Caesar's palace. We came here for Friday's brunch which was $35 which wasn't toooooooo bad. Absolutely no wait at all either around 2pm, win win for my stomach. . . The array of food selection was beautiful! Since it was lunch time, there was a dim sum section, and OH my godddd, the shumai there was absolutely delicious, what I would do for those again. . . The seafood section was fresh and yummy. Kind of wish I ate more oysters now. I love that not only were the food delicious, THEY LOOK AMAZING, the seafood boil was in a cute tiny can, and the fries were in a miniature basket. Dripping cuteness. . . My stomach was about to burst but my stomach is special because it saves a huge section for dessert! I went straight to the macarons. Yes...macarons!! . . I definitely want to go back for dinner in the future!!
This Buffet was very good the design inside was amazing i love the look of the different sections. I only give it 3 stars because overall the food was good it didn't WOW me. But for the dessert section the sweets were amazing i probably tried everything there...it was so yummy. . . I would come back again but i just feel this buffet is overpriced.
