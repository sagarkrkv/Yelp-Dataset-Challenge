Service was excellent. Food was disappointing. Bone in ribeye medium rare was not seared... It was burnt. Like difficult to cut and scraping the roof of my mouth burnt. The meat itself was okay, not juicy at all even though it was definitely pink inside.  I'm pretty sure something is wrong here. Dry aged steaks are still supposed to be juicy even though some of the water is lost in the process, right? Well Cut got my steak wrong or is just wrong in general. I suppose that there strong selling point is the Kobe and maybe I should have ordered it, but then why even have the other dry aged steaks on the menu? Anyway, I was disappointing with how dry and burnt and tasteless my $60 dry aged bone in ribeye tasted and probably wouldn't come back. The breads (pretzel especially) were good, sides were just okay (potatoes and Brussels sprouts) and the service was excellent.
I absolutely loved my experience at CUT during my last visit to Vegas. My friend had been several times before, and said it was a must for our last trip. I was not disappointed. We ate relatively early because we are on East Coast time and it was our first night, and the restaurant was quiet and relaxed.. . Our waiter took his time explaining the menu to me, and offered helpful suggestions. I had the beet salad to start, and it was fantastic. Then, I tried the Tasting of New York Sirloin based on our waiter's recommendation. It included a sampling of American Wagyu from Snake River Farms in Idaho, USDA prime aged, and true Japanese Wagyu. Next time, I would just stick with my traditional filet and get the Snake River Farms filet. But for the experience, I'm glad I branched out a tried the sampler, even though I prefer filet.. . For a side, I tried the field mushrooms with shishito peppers, and thye were phenomenal. Anytime I see shishito peppers on a menu, I order them. They are my favorite, and CUT didn't let me down.. . Of course I was too stuffed for dessert, but I look forward to sampling some of them next time around!
We experienced CUT on New Years Eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   Our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when I stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, I was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  Good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. . . We were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. The seating arrangement worked nicely, although I nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  . . Our servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   We requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  Shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  This should have been my first clue for my own meal.  . . After what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   We waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  Once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(I'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   Breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    . . We ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, apple salad, and butter lettuce salad, pork belly, and the maryland blue crab & shrimp cocktail.   Each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. . . Our group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the PRIME porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  For 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 potato puree and 2 mac & cheese. . . This is where things started to fail.  . . The meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  Once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my "pork" in front of me, which was not pork, but Bone in Rib Eye.   What??  ugh.   From there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  Chaos. . . The sides were then served to each diner.  I'm not certain about you, but I like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when I'm served a 20oz Rib Eye.    That's all that was available, though, so we made do.  The potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. . . The kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  The petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. I know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is CUT.  A $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   . . My Rib Eye? Wow.. very sad.  I had to physically SAW THROUGH the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   I'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   I was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. . . The Porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.. . With three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  Heck, we've seen better service at Applebees when it comes to water.  My husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  It was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  I expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  What the heck?. . By the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  . I've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  I have found other steakhouses in Vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. . . We were seated at our table at 6:30p.  We finally left around 9:30p.  While I'm glad they didn't rush us through, I can now see why they didn't have a reason to.
Absolutely money.  The prices are pretty expensive but if you are looking to have a amazing steak dinner in Vegas, I would recommend this place.  They had the best appetizers I have ever had from a steak house (try the warmed asparagus, I've also had the big eye tuna tartar and the kobe beef tartar and both were awesome), the best side (literally the best mac and cheese I've ever had and it beats even the high end ones that try to mask their mac and cheese with lobster) and most importantly, the best steak i have ever had in my life.  Granted I had the Kobe beef but it literally melted in my mouth. I personally think this is the best steakhouse in the US and I've been to all of them (although I have yet to try carnevino which I heard was equal or better)
My review will strictly be on what I ordered:. . Bone Marrow Flan - Probably the best flan I've had thus far.  They had obviously taken the time and finesse to make sure the bone marrow was cooked evenly.  The texture was luscious, melt-in-you-mouth, and rich.  The mushroom puree alongside was fantastic and brought each bite a bit more earthiness.. . U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Aged 35 days - TRUE steak/beefy flavor.  Tasted like a nice steak straight from your own grill, just with a bit more quality to it.  . . American Wagyu from Snake River Farms - Fat was nicely marbled throughout, without being too overwhelming.  Great beefy flavor throughout.  . . True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Miyazaki Prefecture, Kagoshima - While each bite was TO DIE FOR, I could only handle just a few.  Heavily marbled to the point where that flavor you anticipate from a good steak is lost.  You know that fatty strip alongside a ribeye? That's what the entire steak tasted like.  . . Chocolate Souffle - As someone who focuses in patisserie, I was hesitant trying this, given that were were in a steakhouse and typically speciality restaurants lose focus on all other items.  I was wrong.  The souffle was beautiful... light.. airy... yet so decadent at the same time.. . OVERALL:  Amongst the 3 steaks I've tried, I prefer the American Wagyu.  It still delivered a marvelous beefy flavor that you want from a steak, while delivering a slight richness from the marbling.  Well balanced in my opinion.  . . Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!
We all talk about the bone marrow flan because it's one of the most novel dishes at this Wolfgang Puck steakhouse.  The pureed mushrooms add a mellow earthy accent to the otherwise robust and rich bone marrow.. . As far as steak houses go, it's a solid choice but you're clearly paying for the WP brand.  The Cut clearly prides itself on steak and offering an assortment of the best cuts of beef from around the world.  Whether you're looking at Idaho, Nebraska, or Japan.  Ever spend $155 of a 8 ounces of steak?  Might as well live it up in Vegas.. . Are there better choices in Vegas?  Sure.  But you might as well live it up while you're at the Venetian.

The service is always great, very attentive. Thefood was very tasty, we all had steak, three petite filets and a rib eye....brussels sprouts were really good and of course the desserts are delicious. We had a bottle of  Coho and Biale. It's always nice when Robert Biale is on the wine list.
carnivores must come!. . the waiters were well dressed and professional. the parmesan crispy thing to start off with was soooo messy to eat.  the bone marrow flan was to die for. i wanted to pick up the bone and lick it out clean but i was dressed too pretty to do that.  ribeye was fabulous but for rare i thought it was a little overcooked but it was a fabulous piece of meat. my friend had the chicken with truffles and it was sooooo good. the brocolli and polenta were TO DIE FOR!
OMG where to start with this place?  Everything about it was awesome.  I was in town for CES, and was lucky enough to find a reservation here.  Then we got even luckier that the VIP table had a cancellation...so we got to eat while reclining on banquette seats and cushions in a semi-quiet little alcove by the front door. . . I had the American wagyu beef.  I'd never had it before....it's drop-your-fork delicious, and SO tender...the most tender and tasty steak I've ever eaten.  We also had the pork belly appetizers.....forget about it....that was like bacon heaven.  The mac and cheese is better than mama used to make.  It's very pricey - duh, it's Wolfgang Puck at the Venetian - but it was an awesome, full, well-rounded meal.
Want to make a grown man sob like a baby?  Tell him that the steak is so good at CUT that it ruined you for any steak thereafter....then take him to CUT and watch as he licks his lips, takes a long sip of his expertly chosen Bordeaux and eagerly slices into his $130 piece....of fat and grizzle.. . Then have the waiter smash some glasses on two of your guests and focus on cleaning the mess instead of apologizing to them.. . Then clear my plate while my back is turned so I can't ask the waiter if the guest chef tonight is smoking crack.. . Will I give them a second chance?  Of course.  Will I get psyched up before I go?  Not this guy.  CUT is a serious place so I'll chalk all this up to a "series of unfortunate events".
