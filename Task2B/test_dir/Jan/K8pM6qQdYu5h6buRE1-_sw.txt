Came here for the first time and loved it. We were seated right away. The waitress came. Over and took our order. I ordered the Betty Boop, which is a fried chicken breast and one waffle. My boss ordered a Betty Boop as well, and his wife ordered biscuits and gravy. We were served our drinks in large mason jars. I ordered Pepsi, and my boss ordered... Wait for it... Red Kool Aid!!! I thought that was awesome! So southern! The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and it looked mouthwatering. The chicken was fried just right, and the waffle was so good! Next time. I want to try the biscuits and gravy... If I ever come back to Phoenix in the near future. We also had a side of green beans, and they were delicious. They had a southern Cajun kick to them, but it was so tasty. Not too spicy. Prices are good, not too expensive and the food portions are fulfilling! I left here satisfied!
Very good southern fried chicken and waffles.  Wait staff was amazing and the sweet tea is out of this world good. The waffles remind me of Waffle House waffles, and that's a good thing!  . . I had the chicken tenders and you could tell they were breaded in the kitchen and no pre-frozen. My wife had the chicken and waffles and she really enjoyed it!  . . . Overall, I highly recommend this place!
I've reviewed you before and every time I visit I am more in love with you. Yesterday's meal couldn't have been any better. How is the food so fresh, hot, and delicious time after time after time? Service is amazing as always and the fried chicken was on point. Our sides - candied sweets (wow!) homey grits, spicy green beans and red beans over rice were all terrific too. If only fried chicken were fat free..... Love you Lolo's!!
Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!
omggsssshhhhhhh all that i have enough energy to say (due to me being completely satisfied and stuffed) is black owned business #mypeoplearewinning #newasustudentfromchicagocaliforn
So FAR the best chicken waffles and sides of the West coast. I was not impressed with the macaroni and potato salad but otherwise still the best. Roscoes was not as good in my opinion as the chicken was dry. Here it was juicy, tender, and very moist.
If you haven't been to Lolo's in a while you'll be amazed at how it's changed. At least I was. And don't worry, the changes are good. The place is WAY bigger than it used to be. They even have valet parking now! But it's still as packed as ever and the food is as awesome as ever.. . I met up with some friends on Sunday morning. We had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine.. . After we were seated the first thing we ordered was Kool-Aid. Red. This is the sweetest Kool-Aid I've ever had. They must use twice the sugar. But it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles. I always get the Tre Tre's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle. They really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken, it's just the best thing ever.. . My friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing. For $4 it was pretty small, and they only got one. It was not really worth it. Go for the mac and cheese instead!. . For a good soul food breakfast, nothing in town beats this place.
Traveled to Phoenix via car and after five hours on the road, the food at Lo Lo's hit the spot.  We arrived around 8p on a Tuesday evening and it was 2/3 full.  We were seated immediately.  Staff was attentive.  Ordered food and it was on the table within ten minutes popping hot.  Chicken, waffles, cheesy eggs, cheesy grits, greens ... wonderful meal!!
Well...a splurge is a splurge right? I hadn't been to a chicken and waffles joint since I lived in LA years ago so I knew the kids would be all for BREAKFAST FOR DINNER (aka waffles and chicken). The place is bright and hella noisy music wise but service was friendly and attentive. The fried chicken was absolutely top notch and I love, love, love, rooster hot sauce. The waffles weren't as great as the chicken but my kids still devoured them. The collards were surprisingly bland but fries were good and again the chicken is fabulous!
I've been coming here since high school and this is THE spot in Phoenix for Chicken & Waffles. You have to go to the one downtown. I went to the Scottsdale location and it just wasn't the same. The original downtown location is in this old house, which is very cozy and inviting whereas the Scottsdale location is a huge space in a strip mall (though I heard they're moving locations?) where they are pumping out meals so I don't think the food is quite as good (it does comes out faster).. . The fried chicken is crispy and delicious and the waffles are large thin but still have that crunch. The sides are also pretty good, especially the mac n cheese, but I usually don't have room for much more than the chicken and waffles. I go with the Lo-Lo's- 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Great sugary drinks in mason jars--sweet tea, lemonade, kool aid. Mmmm haven't been to Lo-Los in a while, just writing this makes me want to go back.
3rd stike..... I will never return to this location. . . This is the third and final time I will set foot in this location. Todays encounter was by far the worst. My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy. When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said "OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY"!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply "oh well", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, "I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request. . As mentioned, my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location. It is really sad that the level of service is not the same. But here is a suggestion, maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do, HIRE MORE STAFF!!! Or better yet, turn down the music and have the DJ help out! It's a restaurant not a night club. But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak.
Went 2 the original lolo's in AZ. It was recommended by my son who lived here for 3 years. Needless to say it was spectacular! The chicken was scrumptious and the waffle was tasty. I strongly recommend this spot to you all. To me it is the Roscoes of Az. One of the staff mentioned the owner of this place and the owner of Roscoe's are friends ......  I will be back!
I haven't been to this location in a very long time, and when I did today. I came to a brand new restaurant. Everything changed, idk how I feel about it. Its in the hood ghetto area, then all of a sudden you walk in, its like the location in Scottsdale.  Eehhhh. I like the old restaurant layout better.. and whatttttt? Valet parking? Yesss they did. They upgrade it.. . Best customer service.  They constantly refilled my drink,  so I was never parched :))). . I was bummed that my waffles was soft and crispy. . . :/ my mac and cheese was delish!
Lo-Lo's has been updated and I like the new restaurant. It's more spacious. Easier to get around in, more items on the menu and it looks great inside!. . Fried Green Tomatoes! Oh my goodness! They were the special appetizer. And man, were they good! I tried the sauce, but I liked them better without it. They were tart and the paprika added such a great flavor to them that four wasn't enough.. . The chicken and grits were fantastic as always.. . My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the macaroni and cheese. I eat it like dessert. I could get just that.. . Lo-Lo's is one of the main things that I miss in Phoenix. We eat here almost every time we pass though.
Just a tip I just got informed that you cant park on the building near by, like i have been doing:) so just park near the houses if you cant  find a parking spot near the place
I like chicken and waffles.  This is good!  The service was good.
Best chicken and waffles I ve had. The Mac and cheese is to die for. Lolos is by far better then roscoes in LA.
