I call it the gate way to enter and l leave sin city.  Leaving your plane near baggage claim you are surrounded by slot machines everywhere.  I guess the city want you to get in the mood of spending.  Food offering on the new terminals is very minimal.MGM hotels offer a hotel check on site at the airport witch is a huge plus for me on the last visit.. . Rental cars are located in a separate facility that requires a 10-15 min shuttle ride(bus) .Keep in mind if you rent a a car from a off site car rental facility like I did once you will need plan  at least a one hour to 30mins more to leave your hotel to the air port since your will be taking two buses (offsite car facility to airport car facility to airport).The past two visits  TSA(security)  were not long but it take me 45 mins since everyone in front of me were international travelers.  . . Over all interesting airport Casino airport !
An airport with slot machines? BEST IDEA EVER.....or.... WORST IDEA EVER... that depends on what trip you are asking me such question. Either way, better than LAX, that's for sure!. . Seriously, though. I like airports that are in the city they claim. A 10-15 minute cab ride will get you to your favorite hotel and into the great city of Las Vegas. I have never had to wait too long for a cab and this is an international airport. Win Big! :)
How stupid are the supervisors of this airport? They have small shuttles to get you between terminals. The shuttles are very small buses that can not accommodate luggage. People who have to transfer from international to domestic usually have to grab their luggage and take it themselves. So no room in the shuttles. It is too far to walk. Stupid ignorant cheap supervisors. I can only assume that all the big buses were taken. Do us a favor and do something about that.
Great airport! Lots of quality people watching. This place is laid out well. The only setback is the parking signs are hard to understand.
Slots machines while you wait for your flight..what more can you ask for to pass the time?  They even have them at the baggage carousel for degenerate gamblers.  Yes, I did play them while waiting for my baggage. Generally, there is an attendant nearby each bank of machines, so you can cash out.. . Ironically, I have had pretty good returns on the machines here.
I am not a fan of the design of this airport. It is rather dated, and the boarding areas are enclosed not by walls but windows from floor to ceiling and is a nightmare when the sun is coming down. Slot machines in the boarding areas make these areas cramped and hard to navigate. The only place to recharge your electronics are few and far between, located in the walkways far from the gates. There aren't too many dining options either.
The party starts as soon as you get off your plane. Slot machines all over the airport. Either go broke or win before you get to your hotel. It was very easy to navigate in McCarran. Everythingwas marked so you shouldn't get lost or anything. It was easy to catch a shuttle as well.
A faery impressive airport considering the volume of travelers they serve.  Clean and well laid out.  My only gripe are the really rude and condescending TSA agents, but no surprise, Right?
In line to get my CES badge for the show, the line went pretty fast !
this airport is okay...super close to the strip, but not a fan of having to take a shuttle off site for car rental
I like this airport. It's small but oh so conveniently located, just ten minutes from The Strip. I like how it's easy to find your way around; there's good signage and it's easy to navigate. I like how the bathrooms are a-plenty and they're clean. I don't gamble, but I like the novelty of hearing and seeing slot machines right when you get off the plane, as if they're singing "Welcome to Vegas, baby!". The food options weren't as abundant or diverse as I'd prefer, but hey, for a smaller-scale airport, it wasn't bad. . . The luggage carousels were large and well-delineated, and one can easily pick up a taxi or shuttle van right outside, to take you to the Stripfor under $10 (at least, I got a great rate on a shuttle). On my return visit, to fly out of Vegas, I was able to get through security in an unbelievably fast time (what a refreshing change from SeaTac Airport! Like, night and day).
I connected through this airport on my most recent trip back to California.  The interior looked like it could use a facelift.  There were slot machines in the terminals as well as stores and restaurants.  I was expecting more slot machines but then again, this was an airport and not a casino.  I didn't walk far in the airport to see other parts of the airport since my connecting flight was a few gates down which was pretty close.  It was pretty busy but it was also nearing the holidays when I was here and who wouldn't want to come to Las Vegas?  I guess if you have a long layover, then you can always hit up the slot machines.  Overall, I thought this was a decent airport and would probably connect through here in the future.
More seating please!. . Ok on the plus side there are a lot of food and shopping options inside the Las Vegas airport. You can find something to eat and drink and they even have oxygen bars. . . My issue though is the overall layout is a little too crammed and there needs to be more seating. The slot machines are awesome, but they take up a lot of space. During busy times all of the regular seating gets taken up and you can't sit in any of the tons of empty slot machine seats unless you're playing one. . . I encourage you to take a look at a map and the signs if you are catching a connecting flight. When I flew through last week I started running to catch my next flight at a gate that was a much higher number than the one I came in on. Little did I know the other gate was just around the corner from where I was at due to the funky layout. . . On the transportation front I forewarn that the taxi line can get really long and the rental car center is pretty far off site. I personally lean towards booking a car service. It's a little more pricey but it makes the Las Vegas airport ground transportation a little more bearable.
TSA Pre rocks here. Usually no line and very friendly folks. The main terminal is well laid out. Baggage claim can be a bit daunting after a long flight with all the "Vegas Baby" lights. Overall one of the best small airports.
Las Vegas. Should I say something more?. . when you arrive in the baggage claim hall you find the firsts of the 500000 slot machines you will see in the city!. . Full of souvenirs' shops and also full of bar, it's near the strip so if you have a room in one of the casinos on the las vegas boulevard you can go there by taxi for about 20 dollars.. But don't forgot to ask to the driver to avoid the freeway... he can ty to trick you! I've paid from the airport to the Riviera about 40 dollars. TOO MUCH.. . Otherwise there is also a shuttle that you can take for about 2 dollars If I remember well.. . Enjoy the city and don't forget...if you see it once, you'll never be the same again!
Note: inbound flights will be 99% likely to have drunk passengers and giddy college students. Slots slots slots slots - everyboday!. . But can I just say something? Their Wi-fi is freakishly fast, probably the fastest of any airport I've been to. Guess they need to satisfy all the people Instagramming their "landed in vegas!" photos. . . It's smaller than some other international airports, but it's still well-maintained. Unless you get to your terminal early though, you'll probably be standing. . . Happy Vegas-ing!
As a temporary resident of Las Vegas I fly in and out a lot. The airport is extremely convenient with the economy parking. I usually pre-print my pass and arrive within the the hour. The security is quick for the most part. Note: bring food. They do not have appetizing/ healthy food options
This airport has quite a few things going for it. First it's in Vegas so most people are in a great mood when they land, then maybe they're broke and bitter when they leave but maybe not. They do have slot machines in the airport so if you have a few dollars left you can play them to pass the time while you wait for your flight. They also have cigar and liquor stores in the airport so you can get some items to enjoy on your way to your hotel and thorough the visit.  They also have working wifi and  zones where you can recharge your phone, laptop, etc. The airport is also close to the strip which is convenient, though all car rentals are offsite so you have to take a shuttle bus which is a little annoying but no big deal. . . The bad things are subpar food options depending where you are in the terminal and more importantly the terminal can be CROWDED sometimes with people standing in the aisle and circling the seating area like a shopper in a Christmas mall parking lot trying to scoop up the last seat. . . Overall it's not a bad airport, so long as you get a seat!
I love this airport. Mainly because I love Vegas. Yes, I've spent my fair share of time curled up in the most uncomfortable chair ever created trying not to move or let any light touch me and just praying my flight boards early, but on a normal layover I just can't resist a few slots and a cold drink. You can order drinks from the restaurant bars and walk around with them... and for $12/drink there isn't much you shouldn't be able to do with that drink.. but it isn't the worst way to kill a layover. I also really liked the Pei Wei which is able to get your food to you fast.
This reminds me of what horse tracks used to be back in the late 80's early 90's.  There are slot machines everywhere even past the gate.  There are lounges (non-smoking and smoking segregated) full of machines as well.. . TSA agents here are very friendly and understand people just want to have a good time.. . Also, I won $200 while waiting for my plane.  . . Food options past the gate are limited, but they are pretty good.  I think the food here is more quality over quantity. . . Verdict: if you're ever "stuck" in Vegas, flight delays here aren't so bad.
Slots, slots, slots!. . It makes me laugh that they encourage you to gamble as soon as you step foot into the airport of Sin City. Sadly, like all the casinos, the stench of cigarettes and cigars also lingers over everything here.. . It kind of sucks that it's a little ways out from the Strip so you have to either shuttle or taxi in, but that's just a minor complaint. You can't really get lost, what with the bajillion signs that they have everywhere pointing the way. I've heard that security can be kind of a nightmare here, but Boyfriend and I breezed through TSA and checking in, so fingers crossed it's like this every time.
McCarran International Airport.  It's also known as the "Gateway to Sin".  Alcohol, boobies, gambling, and the most evil of all: buffets, lie wait for you.  . . At your arrival, you'll notice slot machines ringing and enticing you to impregnate them with your money.  As I stared at one of the machines, I could've swore it said, "Hey, big boy!  Five dolla make me holla!"  Anyways, besides seeing slot machines, you'll notice a good amount of fast food joints and shops.  Go ahead and explore, there's a bunch of them.  All with their pros and cons.. . As you make your way downstairs, you'll notice all the signs pointing you to whatever place you need to go.  It's pretty easy to follow the arrows to cabs, rental cars, and other places.  . . But yeah, that's McCarran for yah.  It's just another airport in the world, nothing too special.
McCarran International is pretty damn efficient, considering how many folks fly in and out for conventions, drinking, gambling, strip clubs, fighting and f@cking.
This airport is eh.. Check ins was a horrible experience and security was very rude. . . However, you can drink, there are slots, slots, slots every where and a place to charge your phone. Easy airport to get around.
For every bit I love McCarran Airport there is an equal and opposite hatred for the same.  . . I love flying in and out of McCarran.  I get dropped off at the main entrance and quickly make my way to security without issue.  The lines flow quickly for the most part and sometimes I even come across some friendly TSA agents (though they can be hard to spot).  Depending on which terminal I am flying from I get to see some cool stuff.  When flying Southwest out of the C Gates I get to see the old McCarran that I grew to know as a kid flying out here as an unaccompanied minor to visit my dad.  It brings back good memories.  If I fly to SFO on a different airline (United, Continental, etc) I fly out of the D Gates.  They are much newer and cleaner than C Gates and feel like a mall.  It has a very modern look.  And I love the tram than takes me to the D Gates.  It starts above ground and ends underground.  It is like a mini subway here in Vegas.  Its one of those little things in life that makes me happy.  As for coming home, the trams from both C and D Gates drop you right near baggage claim and it is an easy exit from there.  Usually my dad is waiting there for me.  I have taken the bus and that was a bit of a pain.  I had a hard time finding the bus platform.  Just follow the signs and you'll be fine.  It just may take some time, thats all.. . For my hatred of McCarran, picking up incoming passengers as opposed to being one.  I have picked up a buddy of mine twice and both times we kept missing each other with the couple of different bridges from baggage claim to the parking structure.  One time he walked on the  lower bridge all the while I was on the opposite.  The next time he walked the upper.  The confusion did not end there either.  You have different levels of the parking structure with the same number.  Like Level 2 and Level 2M.  Its not just a different section but a totally differnent level.  People on the elevator get lost all the time and end up getting off too soon and getting right back on.  I learned my lesson from picking up my friend so yesterday when I had to pick up my aunt I went in to baggage claim and waited for her.  There are so many escalators for people to come down I did not know where to watch for her.  I nearly missed her despite my best effort.  Nevertheless I did find her and we retrieved her luggage quickly and it was back out to the parking lot of doom.  I should have used the "Pay Here" kiosks to get out of the parking lot but no, I left the ticket in my car.  So I proceeded to the pay booths at the exit.  One lane was open that was accepting cash.  I got in that line and sat for nearly 15 minutes before I relaized it was not moving.  I don't know if the front car was broken down or if it was just some idiot fishing for loose change.  Either way it was frustrating.  I ended up at a kiosk at the exit and using a card to pay.  A card a put in the direction indicated by the picture on the machine.  It was the wrong way.  A quick turn around and my aunt and I were finally off.  . . I much prefer to be a passenger at McCarran.  That is the way to go.
This was my first time at this airport. Upon exiting the plane the first thing you see are slots machines - which clearly you would expect landing in Vegas. They have a lot of stores here even high end stores like pandora and coach! Yes a coach in an airport! Crazy I know lol . . The airport is smaller than most which is a good thing to find your way around. A lot of the things are spread out, meaning to pick up your checked bags you have to go to the front of the airport which is a long walk to a small Bart ride and then another long walk to your terminal. . . Baggage usually arrives promptly because be on look out in case it changes on which carousel it comes out on. After you pick up your luggage, you can find taxi cabs and shuttle services outside already waiting. If you are traveling with more than two people I recommend you take taxi , which is cheaper. Shuttle service is $7 a person. Taxi is $20 depending on where you are going (we went to New York New York) obviously closer to the airport the better. Overall a great first great experience. If I am ever in Vegas , I will be here again.
I was very impressed by the improvements, this airport has made in the last year. Seems like getting from point A to point B, is now much more simple.. . I was very impressed by the friendliness of the TSA Agents, at the security check point. They treated people like a human, and not a criminal. . . There are many new restaurants, bars, and snack stops.. . I think the gift shops need to lower prices on bottled water. We can't bring in our own, and I feel $3.00- $4.00 a bottle is a rip off.. . The C Gate is a very large area, I think they should install moving walkways to make it easier to walk through.. . I'm a smoker, and I'm glad they added smoking sections. The only change I'd make, is building a few that are in open air. Seems like the minute you walk in, you smell like an ash tray. . . When traveling, I will definitely fly, rather than drive, due to the improvements they've made
Yelp says that I'm a "regular" here. -_- Is that a good or a bad thing? lol. . I've been to Vegas more than a few times so this airport is somewhat.. familiar.. Slot machines can be seen as soon as you get off your plane, duh.. . You have to take a tram to get to baggage claim, FYI.. I don't know if it's just me but out of all the airports I have been to, which is quite a few, this place always takes FOREVER to get your bags to the carousel. It's not the airline because I use either Alaska, Southwest or Virgin. Thought I would point it out.. . The taxi line is always a maze, if you wear heels, GOOD LUCK. lol. If you don't have a rolling bag, I feel bad for you son. lol. I'm just sayin'
