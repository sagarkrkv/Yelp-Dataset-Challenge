This is my go to spot in Las Vegas.  The rooms are impeccable, and it's nothing but high life living when you get to see some of these suites.  Do yourself a favor and get yourself a Mlife Card, because it will get you to come back here more often than not.  Really since The Signature is connected to the MGM Grand, there is no reason for you to have to leave the entire MGM property, but if you do decide to try out the other places, The Signature is a great home base for all your Sin City adventures.. . Book this place and use the option for the 2 Bedroom option!  You will not be disappointed!
They got one star bc of the nice rooms/lowest I can give or else they would get a negative star for terrible customer service. . . Last time I came they broke my key in the ignition! Their manager wasn't there on Sunday so I had to deal with them over the phone when I got home. It took days to work things out. . . This time, they left my bf's lights on and his battery died! Do yourself a favor and self park! It's a ten minute walk and well worth the two hours and $$ spent to get a new battery. . . I wanted to like this hotel so bad but I just can't come back here- literally! I can't keep spending time and money on car troubles. They also wouldn't waive our resort fee. I've never had trouble with that before, especially when I didn't even use resort amenities. What's worse, the guy getting helped right next to me got his waived. WTF! We got it half waived and decided we were never coming back.
***The Signature at MGM Grand is a good option if you are looking for an un-Vegas like hotel on The Strip***. . The Strip is filled with mostly resort and casino combinations that are themed and/or upscale.  Recently though, new properties have been emerging to offer an un-Vegas like experience.  No casino hotels.  No smoking hotels.  I have not stayed at many of these hotels (The Mandarin, Vdara), but my most recent Vegas stay was at The Signature at MGM Grand (which is business friendly and not like the mega casinos on The Strip).  The Signature is filled with spacious condos that are complete with kitchenettes, whirlpool bathtubs and (in some rooms) balconies.. . The Signature is located in the back of the MGM Grand.  It is attached to the MGM Grand via many airport-like automated walkways.  The hotel has very limited services.  There is a small lounge as well as an order-at-the-counter cafe.  For more dining options or expensive convenience store items, you are going to need to make the long trip to the MGM Grand.  This hotel does have its own pool as well as a 24-hour fitness center though it was difficult getting an open machine in the morning.. . The rooms at The Signature are nice.  The decor is up-to-date enough and the rooms are comfortable and very spacious.  Rooms come with kitchenettes, a big living area and a table (this creates a great pre-going out spot).  Rooms are also equipped with safes.  Room temperature was nice.. . There were a few minor negatives in the room.  It was difficult turning the TV off (it kept turning itself back on).  There were some missing items like no hotel directory to provide information on location of business center, fitness center and such.  No laundry bag either.. . Bathrooms are very big here.  Each room comes with a huge whirlpool tub as well as a big glass shower.  Unfortunately, the shower head had a very concentrated blast and not the widespread rain-like shower head many hotels are now featuring.  Getting the perfect water temperature in the shower was not easy either.. . Service was fine.. . Room rates at The Signature are typically higher than the MGM Grand, but they are not too expensive when compared to other similar properties along The Strip and it is less expensive than several of the upscale resorts on The Strip.. . I think how much you like The Signature is going to depend on what you are looking for in a Las Vegas hotel.  If you are looking for a good value room that is big and great for gatherings (as well as not next to a smoky casino), The Signature is a really good option.  If you want a more themed hotel as well as something that is convenient and a quick walk to the many other Las Vegas casinos, The Signature is probably not where you want to stay.. . I personally like having some of the niceties of The Signature like the big rooms and the non-smoking property, but given how far it is from The Strip, I would much rather stay at the Renaissance for a more business-like and less Vegas-like hotel experience, where I am getting the lower room rate as well as earning Marriott Rewards points.. . Complimentary valet parking is offered.  If you want complimentary self parking, you will need to park at the MGM Grand's parking structure, which is a very long walk to The Signature.
Want to avoid the casino? Want to avoid the hustle and bustle? Come here to the Signature at the MGM Grand. Unfortunately, my folks would prefer to stay on the strip. The difference staying here is that you have the amenities at ur disposal that you would have to request at a casino resort. It's like living at home, except you are in Las Vegas. Not to mention, when you pay for the resort fee, you have valet and free access to the gym. Now how does it not get better than this??? really?? Of course tip the valet is required. But, you don't have to worry about "finding parking" .. less stress to worry about.. the gym is right downstairs.. and usually no one's using it, because people are out in vegas for gambling. When I think about vegas, sure.. i want to gamble. But, I also want to relax. I want to go downstairs, and theres no crowd. That's what the Signature at the MGM Grand is. Complete quietness! Great for a honeymoon! :)
We came to Vegas for a special occasion and booked a 900+ square feet suite with all the bells and whistles.. . The Signature is not exactly on the Strip, it's out back. We were confused when we first arrived but once we got on Harmon we were able to find the hotel. We approached a gate and you just let the guard know that you're checking in. They should have your information and the guard will let you know which tower you will be staying and buzz you in. . . We stayed in Tower 2. There is no self parking just valet. So make sure you grab all your stuff when you check in. When we checked in, we were greeted immediately and was given our room information. Additionally, we got some freebies upon check-in. Very smooth and fast process. . . We stayed on the 18th floor with a great view of Vegas. Unfortunately, we didn't get out to the balcony since it was cold. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge! Full kitchen, 2 full bathrooms, spa tub, separate shower, King bed, separate living room, lots of cabinet space, bathrobes, dual closets, bar area and a cool TV in the bedroom that rises up from the table. . . Sadly, I stayed in the room the entire time since I was sick! . . ROOM SERVICE TO THE RESCUE!!!. . Bummed that the food took 45+ mins to get to the room and the bowl of soup I ordered was $10 and full of carrots! Do yourself a favor and walk over to MGM for food or bring food to cook in your kitchen. . . Love how very quiet the hotel is. Very relaxing and soothing. Nice getaway.
This place gets a one star because of the price I got the room and how big it was other than that this place is NOT THE PLACE TO GO! Unless you like to be treated like you're an unwelcome guest then stay here. If you need anything but another room key the staff gives you a hard time about it. I stayed here with my boyfriend for one of our friend's birthday. The lady that checked us in was amazing super sweet and she was the last person to treat us well. After that we needed extra towel and was told that house keeping was over and couldn't receive any. Then my boyfriend and I wanted to do a late check out and our only option was to pay $61 to check out at 6p.m. luckily we wanted to watch the Charger game but really $61 for a late check out!? Then the lady was giving my boyfriend a hard time and said that there wasn't a credit card on file. And then the worse part was when we were watching the game the TV started to mess up so my boyfriend calls and askif they can fix it and the lady says "weren't you suppose to check out already?" Are you serious!? What kind of customer service is that!? If the lady would have dropped her attitude and rude comments to boyfriend and saw that we PAID for a late check out then maybe I would have given this place 3 stars. I have never felt so unwelcomed at a hotel before. The rooms are amazing but the customer service SUCKS!!!!!
I had chosen to stay here for our anniversary & it was wonderful! Bit far from strip, but I'm not much for a casino & smokers in hotels I stay at. Service was great, room is very spacious & cozy! I will definitely stay here again. . (note: it IS a bit of a walk from strip, valet parking only & no major restaurants in towers, in which I personally did not mind)
First time I stayed here, I definitely liked the place. Second time comes around and I would say, I wouldn't come back at all. Nice hotel, SHIT valet service. 30 minutes (twice in a row) waiting. I wouldn't recommend for impatient people.
This is the BEST place to stay in Vegas. I could live here! The staff - from valet to front desk to management - is wonderful. The rooms are luxurious and the views are spectacular. The location is just off the strip so you can still walk everywhere. I stay here every time I am in Las Vegas, which is several times a year. NOTE: be sure to book directly with the MGM, not with LVS aka Blue Chip Vegas. Twice that outfit failed to enter my reservation into the system, causing major delays in check-in. Both times, the MGM accommodated me - the second time even giving me free room service for my hassle - which was in no way the fault of MGM. LVS refused any compensation.
The gf booked the Signature at MGM Grand for our one day/one night staycation.  It was my birthday weekend and yes, she spoils me.  So, when it comes down to price, I don't know if this was a great deal or not.  However, by reading other reviews, a stay here isn't bad at all.  . . I don't do hit up the strip as much as I use to.  But when I do, I love to play tourist.  Staying here was convenient since we also had plans to walk the strip, hit up a few tourist spots, gamble a little, and of course, eat. You get the best of both worlds with the Signature.  You're close to the strip, but you won't feel like it once your in your room.  . . So here are my highlights:. -Great staff. -Parking/Valet.  Valet will usually have free bottles of water in case you need some hydration. . -Security. -Smoke Free. -Spacious Rooms with a kitchen. -Huge bathroom equipped with a nice sized tub and shower. -Free fitness room.  They have free-weights too, but only up to 50 lbs. . -Walkways straight into the MGM.  . -Three Towers. -Happy Hour. -Starbucks. -My favorite...the rowdy "Vegas Baby!" crowds are non-existent. . I had a good time and a great weekend.  It also helps that my stay at the Signature was comfortable.  Yes, I recommend the Signature at MGM.. . . YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (022/366)
