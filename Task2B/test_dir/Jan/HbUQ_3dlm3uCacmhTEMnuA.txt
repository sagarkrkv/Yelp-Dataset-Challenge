In case you were wondering, Tom Colicchio isn't just all talk on Top Chef.  This Texan girl gives major props to his upscale Vegas steakhouse.  . . Also, I still have dreams about the warm, butter-slathered salt-sprinkled dinner rolls that arrive at your table in mini cast iron pans.
Wow, I was so disappointed. The service was 5 star, but the food was barely 3 star. The lobster bisque was great. The beet salad was not. It had a dressing that was... I guess olive oil, and not much else. There were little globs of something else that probably was supposed to add flavor (bright red in color), but didn't. The only flavorful moment was when one little leaf of anise flavored tarragon managed to work it's way into the mix. My filet was done to perfection and delicious,but the scallops were slightly over done. My husband's $56 ribeye was only about 3/4" thick and didn't taste as good as the supermarket cut we had barbequed ourselves last week. The risotto was delicious. The shiitake mushrooms didn't even look like shiitake. We come from Portland and eat wild shiitake all the time... The brussel sprouts were bitter and the bordelaise sauce was invisible. In summary: The meat was pretty good, but the side dishes were a total fail. . I do have to compliment the service. It made the experience itself special, even if the food didn't. However, $100+ per person should include wonderful food. Next time we'll try Gordon Ramsey.
Went for my 5 year anniversary, it was absolutely amazing.  Couldn't think of a single flaw.  Quick tip though, the tasting menu is A LOT of food.
When we arrived at the restaurant they told us it would be a few minutes before our table was ready and we could wait at the bar. No problem. My husband and I ordered drinks and once our table was ready the hostess notified us and was ready to show us to our table. However, she made no offer to have our drinks brought to our table. Not that I was expecting HER to do it but she could've had someone else do it. It's awkward when you're at the bar, have your purse in tow, jacket on and have to carry a martini glass wearing heels to your table. That's my only gripe :). . Food and service thereafter was great. The best thing about this place is that they are completely fine with you splitting an entree. We shared the lobster bisque which they offered to split for us which was great! We then shared the rib eye which was cooked perfectly medium rare and ordered the risotto as a side. The food was really tasty and just the right amount without being overly stuffed. Our waiter and staff were all very good. The waiter even put a rush in for our food since we had a show to catch. Very nice of him.
Nothing special. Came here for our Anniversary dinner & unfortunately we weren't WOWED. I got the RibEye Bone-In (medium) & my BF got the Wagyu Ribeye...pricey and they weren't even tasteful/juicy. It was OKAY. I like lobster but I wasn't a fan of their Lobster Bisque...the Potato Puree was good tho. Buttery. I've had better steak. Wayyyyy better. I recommend trying some other steakhouse! Like Mastro's, Westin Bonaventure, Morton's!
Once you enter it's like a maze. They have tens of small rooms rather than one large room. Each room has wooden crafted enclosing from 1 to 5 dining tables. I did not like the design myself as I rather be on a larger setting where I can see everybody. . The food is Chinese with one item as much as $450!  I got the Mongolian beef and fried rice. It was just average. My wife had green salad. She seemed to like it.. The service was excellent. The waiters came along often.
Made reservation for dinner and still had to wait 10-15min to get seated. It wasn't too bad of a wait since they temporarily sat us at the bar and football was on. . . Everyone was really nice it seems like each table gets two waiters/waitresses so there's always someone to help us if we needed anything. . . Overall experience with customer service was fanatic. However, the food there didn't really blow me away. Don't get me wrong everything was delicious, especially their lobster bisque! But nothing really exceeded my expectation in terms of taste. I wish they had a bigger/better dessert selection though.
This was the second time I have eaten at Craftsteak. The first time was in Los Angeles. I like this restaurant very much. It's very easy to get to especially if you are staying in the MGM.. . When we arrived we were seated right away and experienced terrific service all night long. We ordered the beef tartare to start. I thought it was pretty tasty, but my wife thought it was a little gamey. For our entrees we split a 22oz dry aged bone-in NY strip with sides of potato gratin and creamed spinach. Personally I was not a big fan of the taste of the steak. It tasted of hamburger to me. I don't have much experience with dry aged steaks, so maybe that's just part of the flavor. It was better dunked in the sauce that came around the steak. The previous time we had split a Rib Eye and loved it.. . Overall, a little pricey, but a great dining experience.
Go with the tasting menu. Lobster bisque could have been hotter b/c hot soup was poured into (large) chilled chunks of lobsters which cooled down the whole dish. Mushroom sides could have been more tender. Steaks (raison d'etre) cooked perfectly. Great service. Waited 15 minutes despite reservation.
Boring and overpriced. $840 for three people. We had wagyu filet mignon, ribeye, and NY strip. Couldn't tell the difference from wagyu to regular prime cuts. Sides are boring. There is no wow factor here. Purre'd mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus all cooked like every other steakhouse. I should have known better steakhouses do not try hard. There is zero creativity in this place. Poured our own wine every single time. Service was okay. I might be biased because I don't think grilled beef is worthy of high ratings.  Just boring for a wow factor bill.
Food was definitely not nearly as good as it should have been for the price. Orders were mixed up, the pork belly appetizer was three tiny slices, sommelier did not know enough... and to top it off my friend has food poisoning from an undercooked steak. What kind of meat do they serve?
Amazing grilled bison steak!  Blue cheese stuffed olives.  Prosciutto served with two tiny poached pear slices.  The kale was tasty but offered too much slab bacon and drippings for my taste - I was instantly transported to the south!  To be fair, everyone else in my group of 8 liked it.  . . The focus in the restaurant was food expedition.  Everywhere, food was being served all around, and it took a long time to serve it all as it is allala cart.  However they let us sit with our dirty dishes, empty glasses and without our bill for too long after the meal, while other tables were served endless plates of food.  Overall this was a very good experience.
My only regret is that I did not save any room for dessert. I really wanted to try the monkey bread, but alas I could not eat another bite. I ordered the ribeye and my boyfriend got the bison steak. Both were very good. Wasn't the best steak I ever had, but I would go back. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the rolls. So good!
The steak was good and especially liked the sweet corn with pieces of onion mixed in.  Prices are high but the service was excellent.  One thing that I really did NOT like (and I hope the restaurant manager is listening) was the photographer lurking around taking photos. I know you dont have to purchase the photos if you dont want to (and we didn't) but if I am paying $50-$90) for a single steak and another $100 for a bottle of wine, I do not want a photographer bugging me and telling me and my date how to put my head on my hands for a stupid pose and then coming back with the prints and bugging me again with the hard sell. Its really sleezy!   Sorry guys, its a good restaurant but I don't need my photo taken there.  And now, months later I am getting spam from the photographer on a weekly basis.
A superior steak experience without the overblown nonsense. . . I love steak, but I only go to steakhouse two or three times a year because it's normally way too much. The sides and bread alone are enough to choke a whale. Eating at those places often feels like a competition where manhood is measured in your ability to over eat..  . Craft Steak isn't like that. The cuts of meat are flavorful and well prepared. The hanger steak and the short ribs are both great choices. The wine and whiskey selection is extensive and a glass of Johnny Walker Blue was $20 less than the price in New York. There are decadent choices like the monkey bread, the carmel cheesecake and the addictive garlic rolls. But none of it is so large and overblown to turn you off. . . The service is exceptional and thr decor is warm and modern. The paintings of sad cows on the walk might make you feel guilty so don't look over there while you enjoy your steak.
Hands down the BEST, most PERFECTLY cooked Filet I have ever eaten. Went with the Wagyu Domestic Chef's Selection, a perfect 4 course meal!  The desserts (Monkey Bread and Carmel Cheesecake) were the perfect finish to such a lovely date night!  Pricey, but worth every penny!
