The burgers are fantastic (though pricey)! I ordered the red velvet shake and it was also pretty good. However, one of the people I was with ordered the Fat Boy shake, which is listed on the menu as a caramel popcorn and pretzel combination. It came out with captain crunch and tasted like butterfinger. We complained to the waiter who informed us we were mistaken for wanting something else. It was escalated to the manager who also informed us that we were the ones in the wrong. The Fat Boy was designed to be a surprise mix of ingredients (which makes sense considering the title). Change the menu to provide an accurate description! The service obviously left a lot to be desired.
Came in only to try a shake ($11.00). We got the Brown Cow Float, which is essentially an alcoholic Root Beer Float... oh man, it was creamy, frothy, and best of all the Pop Rocks tossed on top played on the tongue so nicely. I think I giggled every time I got a mouthful, but I'm silly like that.. . Art on the walls is by Juan Muniz, and I was impressed. Street art style, looked like it was commissioned for the restaurant specifically. Very cool!. . Otherwise this place is a fairly typical bar-- I want to say sports bar, but there wasn't that theme, it just had that feel. The hostess was very friendly and did her best to answer all the questions our friend grilled her with about the restaurant. Nice place for a drink, maybe next time I'll try the food.
First time here, had "The Rising Sun" and it wasn't spectacular at all. Was hoping for a better burger. Nothing too special.. just a gourmet burger place with a whole bag of salt. The burger was way too salty.. i thought they were trying to overdose me with salt... it was to the point where I could not stop drinking water after the meal. A good casual place to eat.
Upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. . . I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a "short" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!. . Most of us decided on selections from the "Big Buns" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the "Gold Standard" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.. . With your "Big Buns" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!. . Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.. . I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!
This place is a hit or miss as for experience dining inside.. . I can't deny that their burgers are delicious but depending on what time and server you get, your experience will depend on service.. . I came to Holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great. Good service, good waiters and good food. The second time I came, it was horrrrrrrible!! The food was good as always. But the service was just terrible! The thing that angered me the most is that it was only our table receiving such bad service. We see others receiving their food promptly and watching the managers check up on them but when the manager came across our table, he straight turned away and ignored us!!! Didn't even ask if we were doing alright. Which we weren't! We waited forever to get our food and the waiter was pretty much non-existent to us! It took forever to get his attention and we even waited forever for our check even when we asked for it.. . The third time, we learned better so we decided to order togo and eat in our rooms. That way, we don't have to deal with inconsistent service.. . Anyways, as for the food. Definitely try the billionaire burger. Hey, you're in Vegas so go big or go home! The foie gras is perfectly seared and so flavorful and the combination of the onions and truffle sauce is sooo good! So worth the price! Only $28! If you want something a little bit reasonable, the rising sun, the fun-ghi and el machete are all delicious as well! . . It's surprisingly a good burger joint and is a must try if you're staying in Cosmo!
Wow.... Toshi the bartender is AWESOME! He really knows how to take care of your group. His specialty is making incredible concoctions that the females in the group can enjoy. I am definitely coming back here. Great vibe at the bar and fair prices! As for the food, I give it 4 stars. Toshi is the only reason this place is getting 5.
Thought we would have to wait considering it was NYE and lunch time, but surprisingly the restaurant was bigger than expected and we were seated for 8 right away.  The server came over and took our drink orders and told us the specials right away.. . To start we ordered the pork sliders and pork belly buns.. Someone loves pork!  They were both pretty good.  The pork sliders had an Asian twist with cilantro and peanut sauce.  It was a good combination.  The pork belly buns were good and tasty, but a little too fatty for my tasting.  I took a bite and it was all fat. No meat at all.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't like the fat texture.  Overall the appetizers were good.  We also ordered amazing onion rings that were stacked really high.  They were so crispy and so good. . . I ordered the rising sun burger cooked medium.  It was delicious and I think I could've eaten it all myself, but I shared it.  It came with steak fried which were thick but crispy.  . . Other people ordered a salad which looked good, but didn't taste good.  (But who orders a salad at a burger joint?) It was a waste if money because it costs doubled for the salad compared to my burger.  I'm sure they will never order a salad at a burger joint ever again. . . Service was good andthey gave us popcorn as he delivered everyone water.  I wanted to ask when the movie started.  The popcorn was good.  . . Some people in my group didn't like it, but i didn't order a salad at a burger joint so I really liked my burger.  Will definitely go back to try a shake with my burger.
My husband and I stayed in Las Vegas for a week. We went the first night to this restaurant since it was close to our hotel room. We ended up comparing the 'billionaire burger' to every other restaurant we ate at. Nothing could compare! This billionaire burger with kobe beef, caramlized onions and truffle mayo is delicious!  We had to go back on our last night.
Want inexpensive and good food inside a hotel? Cosmopolitan has it set for you.  Good service, vibe, and American comfort food of burgers (with cool toppings) are waiting for you!
*** Mmm-mmmm .... .       That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?.       Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef..       Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.. . Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.. . Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.. . Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.. .  *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? .        Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.. . Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.. . *** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?.       Ah, hit the spot.. . Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Creme Brulee, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.. . Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.. . I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.
Finally, aVegas burger restaurant that puts smile on my face. . . There's a DJ in the restaurant, so if you are not here for the LOUD music - come here before 9 ~ 10 PM.. . Good service and free complimentary popcorn - unfortunately, it tasted like a regular popcorn (I like kettle corn better than plain popcorn).. . Truffle lobster mac n cheese (creamy Tallegio-mascarpone Sauce, with Maine lobster and black truffle - $16.5) - Wow, what an amazing appetizer. Not too creamy with a hint of lobster flavor. Definitely one of the top mac n cheese in my book.. . The Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado - $17, medium rare) - I love it! I really liked the tempura-fried avocado and the Kobe beef patty. The only downside? Teriyaki sauce was a bit too strong. . . Excellent burger and mac n cheese, enough said. . . P.S. - It's located at 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, right across from the Marquee Nightclub.. . P.S.S. - This restaurant serves booze shakes.
First thoughts: Is that a paper-mache cow in the middle of the room? . . Holsteins really has out done themselves with the funky street art hung up all around their restaurant. It keeps the space looking fresh and not dated. The food selection looked great! Though my bf and I didn't order any entree food items, I noticed some of the other diners eating burgers and fries. The burgers looked big and juicy and would be something I'd be interested in ordering the next time I'm back at Holsteins.. . My bf and I came to Holsteins specifically for dessert and we ordered a black and white milkshake to split ($8). While waiting for our dessert, our server brought a bucket of popcorn to the table. The complimentary popcorn may have looked unassuming in the little pail but once we started nibbling on it, we couldn't stop! It was warm, buttery and some pieces had a slight sour bite to it. It was crack popcorn!. . The milkshake was rich and oh-so delicious. I'm not particularly fond of sweets but I found myself taking large gulps of it. The whipped cream on top was just enough and truly the perfect compliment to the vanilla and chocolate. There were also little chocolate wafer balls on top of the milkshake that added the perfect crunch.. . Bottom line: Word of advice: order one of the milkshakes; you won't regret it.
Went back w/ my girls (that have major allergies) & was very disappointed w/ how they've changed.... They could not have any fried foods like french fries, cuz they have a seafood allergy, and i was told that they fry the calamari in the same fryer???? That right there is major red flag for anyone w/ a seafood allergy!! So, be aware people w/ allergies.....ASK & TELL your server about your allergies,  before you order!!!
fries are a bit too salty but i would come back
I'm docking Holsteins are star because the service has gotten to be somewhat hit or miss.  Sometimes on point, sometimes not so much.  Others have made similar observations, so I know it's not just me.  Let's put it this way, I skipped Holsteins on my most recent trip because I was uncertain about how the service was going to be.  And  based the service that caused me toskip Holsteins on my most recent trip, the four-star rating is itself a bit of a legacy rating.
I want to start off saying that I am not a fan of burgers or milkshake...with that said, this place is pretty solid, the burgers good and the shakes are quite creative, my husband tells me that this is the best burger place he has been to, so I guess Ill take his words for it. Sam's Burger in Sf is my fav, but this place aint bad =)
Located in the Cosmopolitan, second floor, across from Race Sports and Marquee. We got very lost trying to find the place. The map initially made it look like it was in the Bellagio, then Vdara... Had to ask a few people along the way for directions.. . Once we found it, we got seated right away in the bar area, about a 10 minute wait for a normal table. Great beer list, fun grown-up milkshakes, and good burgers and fries. The sweet potato fries are better than the plain ones, in case you're on the fence about which to get. All in all, worth the trek we had to take to find the place.
I've eaten at a lot of nice burger places in my life, living in SF (Umami Burger, Burger Bar, Roam Burger) and the burger I had at Holsteins was the best burger I've had. This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1/3 of the price and 3 times better.. . There were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch. . . My only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.. . Each bite was perfection - my mouth is salivating thinking about this meal. I haven't eaten a lot of burgers in Las Vegas, but I don't need to try any other places - I'll just keep coming back here to repeat this burger and new ones.
Overpriced for mediocre food and service. Our server also had an attitude the entire time he was helping us. I've gone here several times with my girlfriends on our Vegas trips, and we've had a lackluster experience each time.. . I ordered their most popular burger (recommended to me by the server), and it was very oversalted. I couldn't finish it.. . Skip this restaurant, and hit the buffet!!
Went to Holsteins on our last trip to vegas. When we ate here it was packed. Tables are also close together so the seating was a bit cramped for my liking. Our Server however was excellent. He was friendly and knew the menu well. I decided to go with the Kobe burger. It had chips on it which added a interesting flavor to the burger. I also went with one of the loaded shakes. The shake was great and by far my favorite part of the meal. The burger was good however a bit on the dry side. It was a good size just not on par with The Burger bar or Ramsey burger. One nice thing here though is the fries were included with the burger unlike Ramsey burger (they are included at the burger bar also). As one of the more popular places to eat at the Cosmopolitan Holsteins could use a bigger dinning room. Over all the burger here is good but I like the Burger bar and Ramsey's if you are looking for a gourmet burger. Don't miss out on the loaded milkshakes though!!!
The Gold Standard burger with an egg added was really really good. I thought the patty had just the right amount of bite and flavor. The bun was also superb-- just the right texture. I'm pretty easily impressed when it comes to gourmet burgers though. . . My husband got the burger with the chips in it.. nom nom. It was a little plain and not so nom nom. He wanted mine.. . The sweet potato fries are way worth the $1 upgrade. They were perfection on my tongue. Nice and crispy and chewy.. . We also split the autumn house salad... it was SO good. Lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.. . We split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. Wanted to try others but we were way too full.. . Great draft beer selection too.. . But the 5 stars really goes to the outstanding waitstaff. My husband was in a wheelchair and barely up on crutches during our visit. He needed to use the restroom and when he asked where it was, our waitress was like "wait, there's a line right now" and actually offered to keep checking to see if the line cleared and let us know. I can't remember her name but she was a sweetheart!
YES. YES. YES.. . I love everything about Holstein's.  Their food is SO GOOD - get the Asian pork belly - OMG.  The milkshakes look amazing but I haven't tried them yet as I'm usually hitting up Marquee later that night and need to save some room for liquor.  . . Ambiance is great.  The decor is hilarious and cool at the same time - like butcher shop meets harajuku lovers?  And they have a great DJ that plays after 10 (love that they're open super late!). . I will continue to come here every time I'm in Vegas, and you probably should too.
Hands down the best burger I have ever eaten.  Their menu is so versatile and each and every burger is unique and delicious.  The also have a variety of milkshakes that you are able to make alcoholic.  I sat at the bar, which was large and had multiple tv's.  The bartender's were on point and a pleasure to talk to.  My bartenders name was Anna, and she was wonderful.  The entire experience for me was great and perfect. I will definitely be back here again and urge anyone who is in town to stop by and give your taste buds a treat.
I had the steakhouse burger and fries and I couldn't stop eating them. It was really good! The restaurant is loud but that doesn't bother me and our waitress was nice. Next vegas trip we'll be going again!
Went for a lunch meeting. Good service, good food! Solid all the way around. Since it was more business than pleasure could not enjoy as much as would have like, but will be back again.
Overpriced for mediocre food and service. We were recommended to come here by some friends and since we were already staying at the Cosmo, we decided to come here for dinner one night. It's located right across from Marquee. We were promptly seated upon arriving around 9pm on a Tuesday night, no wait. I ordered a Caesar's salad with chicken and my friend ordered a Memphis burger. The service here was horrible. They never come by to check up on you nor seem to care. All the servers seem to have this haughty attitude to them. My salad came out without the chicken I requested. Once I told them it took forever for them to bring out the chicken. The food is just as bad. Chicken was way too dry and looks gross. The burger lacked flavors and the patty was also super dry. We had to flag them down for them to bring us condiments. Who doesn't need ketchup or mustard at a burger joint?!. . Maybe one of these days I will muster up the courage to give them a second chance but for now, pass!
Amazing burgers!!!  Honestly, the BEST burger I've ever had.  A true chef's creative touch makes these burgess extra special. The Fun-Ghi was the best!!  My husband had the Salmon burger and the sashimi on top of the grilled filet of salmon was the special touch making it fabulous. Kids ate every last bite on their plate as well... CA turkey burger and kids sliders. Will be back if we end up in Vegas next year!
After reading the reviews, I was so excited to come here, since my Husband and Brother in law were looking forward to a great burger. Unfortunately we will not be back EVER.  . . Service was slow since we had to wait for our waitress to ask us for drinks after 10 minutes and waited another 10 just for the drinks. Food was so-so (except the milkshake which I must say was delicious according to my Niece). But then we all got sick within the hour after eating Turkey burgers and Gold Standard.  Not one in our party of 6 was saved from the need to sight see every restroom in the Vegas Strip near the Cosmopolitan. Maybe this was a fluke but I cant risk coming back here and being disappointed again.
Hands down the best burger place I have been to. The quality of the meats is very good, and the serving size will leave you completely full and going home with a doggy bag. I've tried half the burgers on the list, and they have all been great, although the million dollar burger was the leastimpressionable and totally not worth it. When in doubt, keep it simple and get the nom nom or get the flavorful rising sun with a side salad or the sweet potato fries. Also, try the lobster mac and cheese! It comes with lobster chunks and sprinkled with bread crumbs. You're tongue an stomach will be please, and even as a midnight snack or leftovers, it will still taste good!
I guess we were expecting too much but overall it was just average.  I've had better burgers at a much less price.  Again it was bad, but for the price I was expecting greatness.  Last word of advice, definitely get the burgers and say no to the sliders.
Yum, yum, and more yum!. . One of the places I look forward to stopping at in Vegas. Their burgers are delicious, and I love their shakes. I always seem to go back to the Gold Standard, it's probably my favorite burger there. Everything is a bit expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for... Although they could be a little lower. Half a star down for that.. . The popcorn in buckets while you wait definitely help settle your stomach down a bit. It's so delicious, and I never thought a higher-end restaurant pulled off popcorn as an appetizer so well.. . The other reason they don't have five stars is because of their service. It always seems to take forever to get things. Whether with three people, or a group of high schoolers, it always takes forever.. . BOTTOM LINE:. If you have time, and you don't mind spending a lot, this place is worth the taste!
This was the first stop on the strip for my boyfriend and I and we were not disappointed. First of all, their chocolate shake is THE BEST I've ever had. And I've had a lot of shakes in my life. I can't pin point just what makes it so delicious, but it is incredible. I loved the dining room. Plenty of seating and large, yet still cosy and intimate. I wasn't crazy about my turkey burger, but that's probably due to the fact that I was full and blown away by the shake I had already downed. Their fries and onion rings however, are great. All in all, I would (and have) return.
I wish I could remember how the food was, but the service was so bad, I just scarfed down my burger and got the hell outta dodge.. . We were guided to the lounge and promised full service - yet 5-10 minutes later no one come by to even greet us.  Additionally, group of 3 ladies took the booth right next to us and were waited on almost immediately while we were promptly ignored.  We asked to be moved to a table and politely made our wait time known to both the front and back area hostesses.  The hostess who showed us to our seat assured me that we were seated in "her favorite waitress' area and she'd send her right over."  Well, after several more minutes of being ignored (a female waitress gave 2 tables within arms reach a check and cleaned off their table without ever making eye contact with us) a male server finally came over to take our order.  I was supremely frustrated and ready to leave when a server arrived. Overall it really put a damper on our Las Vegas experience, even though I was dressed in trendy cocktail attire and my companion in a button up shirt and khakis, we were still feeling deliberately ignored by at least 2 servers, and our current server seemed a little apologetic but never said so and didn't offer us anything to make up for it.  I fully regret not leaving before ordering.
Definitely one of the best burger and shake restaurants I've ever been to. Service was excellent! Loved everything my waiter recommended.. . The burger and lobster roll was delicious. But what made this place a 5 star for me personally was the alcoholic shake, sooooooo gooooootttttt.. . If you love pumpkin flavor, you MUST get the pumpkin pie shake. I would trade my first born child for it. Haha jk. But no really, it's out-of-this-world delicious.
If I had a sixth sense, it would be recognizing great beef. Holsteins burgers definitely hit the mark in the beef category. I would give it the nod over the Burger Bar. Opted for the Gold Standard and it was a great choice. Pair it with one of their shakes (had the Oreo) and you have something that is "Last Meal" worthy.. . It helped as during the commercial break from the game, the attractive lady behind the bar had my attention. Ooowee
LOVE THIS PLACE!!!. . The spiked shakes are delicious and they give you the extras too so when you're done with your cup you just add more from the silver cup they gave you.  It's like ordering more but only paying for one :). . I love all the cute pictures on the wall, really wish they sold them on shirts or something.   . . Have had quite a few burgers from here and I will say that they are all good.  The billionaire burger might be a little overrated but it's still good.. . Never really had to wait here which is awesome compared to some of the buffet lines in Vegas.  Will for sure be back here quite a few more times.
This was amazing!  Had the Nom Nom Burger and it was awesome!  Enjoyed the cocktail that our waiter recommended, the blood orange Cosmo and it was perfect.  If you get a waiter named Derrick, he is great.  Very helpful in selecting the perfect burger!  Would come back in a heart beat!
Def one of my fave burger places - maybe because it's located in one of my fave places to stay in Vegas: The Cosmopolitan. The burgers are delicious and cooked to perfection. The only downside is a burger and fries cost around $20. Love the vibe. Service is good. It's definitely worth checking out.
Both Julia D and myself loved Holsteins. We wandered along around 11 am in search of a hearty meal that would cover both breakfast and lunch so after much deliberation and indecisiveness (from me) we decided to go for hamburgers.. . To my delight they were showing the NFL games in a bar area and had a screen in a quieter area which I ended up following. The server was incredibly helpful, I liked the way the menu was explained especially how every burger option on the menu can be customized. As someone who doesn't go for a huge amount of toppings on a burger this was much appreciated. The burgers themselves were great, really good quality beef which tasted great. Holsteins really hit the spot and provided one of the best meals I ate in Las Vegas
I came here when I stayed in the Cosmopolitan last December. Holsteins was very conveniently located and fairly priced. We didn't have to wait long for a table, either. . . Food was good, service was good. I would definitely come back :) . . FYI - boyfriend and I both checked in via Foursquare and got a free alcoholic drink each.
Only got the fries and the black cow shake. Neither were good. Maybe next time will be different.
Good burgers are easy enough to find. But GREAT burgers are treasures that you sometimes have to look for. If you want a great burger in Vegas, then look no further, because Holsteins is it! . . The burgers are made with the finest ingredients, are thick and juicy and are cooked to perfection. They're also a bit eclectic. While you can get a basic cheeseburger is you're a boring guy who has given up on life, I highly recommend that you try one of the more unique selections. My wife and I split a "Rising Sun" and a "Gold Standard" burger. Both were excellent. The onion ringswere also amazing. They were giant and the breading was nothing short of spectacular. If you're looking for an adult (i.e. alcoholic) milkshake, try the "Fat Boy," which contains pretzels, chocolate/Carmel popcorn, Reese's, and vodka. It was'nt too strong, but it was DELICIOUS! . . The only downside is that this place is expensive, but when you're eating at good restaurants in Vegas, what place isn't expensive? I suppose the best way to spin it is that you get what you pay for. . . Highly recommended! Two thumbs up (and some toes too... It's that good!).
Great burgers and shakes..perfect location..great staff..and great combos..beast burger this weekend for superbowl a must have
On our recent visit to Las Vegas, we were looking for a substantial lunch that would hold us over through the afternoon, past a show, to a late night dinner.  Our friends had recommended Holsteins, and as fans of Burger Bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  Spicy and delicious!  Our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu. . This place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  We wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the "Sausage and Peppers" Potsickers and the Mexican Car Bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  The potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... O.M.G.  Sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  These things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  But we absolutely loved them.. . For our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (I know I know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  I had the Surf and Turf Quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, Manchego Cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  Very yummy.  For our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the El Machete, described on the menu as "Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli".  The beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  The burger overall wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  Either way, it was good good beef.. . We finished with a "grown up" milkshake... the Campfire S'mores, which I only had a few sips of because I was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  They will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  Overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at Holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in Las Vegas.  Oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  We will definitely be back!
I was super hungry for lunch, and left my cosmo room to the 2nd floor and wondered around. Very glad i decided to order from this spot. . . I ordered a tuna appetizer. really good, cold, and tasted fresh. . . I ordered the pork bun sliders. They were a bit dry but tasted great. Wonderful moist buns. I'd probably get them again if i end up stayin in cosmo. The bartender was really nice but rushed me to close out my bill. boo.
I absolutely LOVE the Billionaire Burger (Kobe beef & foie gras) with a side of sweet potato fries.  Lately, the kitchen has been over cooking their beef so I have been diligent in asking for "rare" so my beef patty is not over-cooked.
