My husband and I have been wanting to eat breakfast/brunch at Bouchon for many years. But let's face it, it's Vegas and we never get up in time. We finally did, as we had an early flight, and I'm sad we hadn't sooner. My husband ordered the French Toast. I'm very picky when it comes to French Toast (I think my mom's is the best). Wow! Best French Toast ever! Don't tell my mom. I ordered the omelette de jour with button mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and cheddar cheese. Awesome! A slice of brioche with raspberry jam was a great ending to the meal. We each had coffee. Only a $38 bill, not bad for a great meal in Vegas. . The service was top notch, from the hosted to the waitress to the servers. Our coffee cups never went empty. . We will make this a must every time we are in Vegas....even if it means sacrificing some zzz's....it's totally worth it.
I used to live in Napa and was very excited there was a Bouchon here in Vegas! Not only is the cuisine excellent, but I love the atmosphere and ambiance of both the Napa and Vegas restaurant. Bouchon has a bit of everything and I always love trying new items every visit. They have a great kids menu as well so don't be intimated.. . Rillettes aux Deux Saumons was an item that seemed odd to me, but really delicious when I tried it. I'm a huge fan of their Confit de Canard, which sells out fast! Also love their perfectly roasted Poulet Roti, the Croque Madame, and Sole Billi Bi!. . Brunch reservations go fast on weekends, but sooo perfectly portioned and I love their selections and accompaniments!  The raw bar has an incredible selection of freshly flown in sea food. . . The desserts are a perfect way to end a good meal. I love the Bouchons!! MMM!!! It's an experience that always takes me to a place of relaxation and indulgence!
I travel to Vegas every year for a national meeting, and every year we end up here and I have yet to be disappointed. Excellent food and wine, attentive service, good atmosphere. The meal is solid from start to finish. The bread is so good it is hard not to ruin your meal with it. I have tried almost every salad on the menu and for entree I find myself going back to the scallops frequently. Finish it off with world class creme brulee and you will feel satisfied. You are much better off spending your money here than at the craps table!
Bouchon is pretty good but it seems to be going downhill.  I've been several times in the last couple of years.  Initially, I would've given this place 5 stars, but my last visit was just meh, so I'll give this an average of 4 stars.  . . They previously had octopus on their menu, which was excellent.  Their bread and foie gras are also excellent.  Their cheeses are pretty good.  Salads are also pretty good.  Everything else I've tried on their main menu hasn't been memorable (I can't even remember what they were).. . In general, if I were to go back, my strategy would be to order items not in the main course section, and it will probably be pretty good.
If I can not have breakfast in Spain then Bouchon is Las Vegas will have too do. The food is beautiful , fantastic and delicious. The pastries are so buttery and flaky. The eggs and hash are the best I have had in a restaurant. The room reminds me of being in Paris or Spain and I feel like I have travel far, as if the dropped a Paris cafe in the middle of Vegas.
Pleased, but not entirely as blown away as the Thomas Keller name implied my experience should be.  It was worth the money, not as expensive as I expected, very high quality, but at the same time not as sublime as I was expecting.  The meal had one defect (remedied by them), but again, not as spot-on as I had hoped.. . Service was decent; our waitress was bubbly, though not entirely attentive.  Our sommelier did a very good job of selecting a Rhone wine for about $100.. . Our first course was salads, and probably the best part of the meal for me was the Salad au Frisee Lardons.  I order this dish whenever I see it on a restaurant menu, and this is one of the best that I have ever had. The addition of fresh tarragon, which complemented the very subtle vinegar from the surface of the poached egg was,...okay, yes...sublime.  I thought, "Okay!  This is going to be awesome!". . Ournext course was the Seared Fois Gras.  It was good, just good.  Served with a reduction and on a nice brioche-like round, it was a simple and classic presentation.  Yet, it didn't really marry is a way that did the foie gras justice, or as well as I have had at less-prestegious restaurants.  Almost ordered another one since I live in Fois Gras-starved CA, but I didn't think of doing that and canceling my main course (as I have done before when the Fois Gras course was worth a replay, like at Saddle Peak Lodge.). . The low point came when I ordered the Steak Bouchon.  A thick cube of ribeye about 2.5 inches in each dimension, the dish has a challenge, I think, in that there are parts of a ribeye that are less tasty (the eye) than others (the rim and tail).  I ordered medium rare, asking also what the chef would recommend -- waitress agreed.  When the dish arrived, I could tell there was a problem when I tried to stab the steak with my fork.  Tough. Overcooked.. . With some effort, I cut a slice, noting that it was definitely medium, and it was entirely the "eye" of the ribeye.  IMO this piece cooks faster and also is more prone to getting tough due to its lower fat content.  This had both.  I tried to eat it, but at $51 I had to send it back.  When I asked the waitress if it looked medium rare to her, she shined a little flashlight on it and said, "Well, in the kitchen it probably looks more rare than it does out here."  I'm not really sure what that meant, as I had ordered medium rare for ME not the kitchen, and since I was the first person cutting it open (and it certainly didn't "behave" MR when I first pressed on it with my fork), I have no idea how someone would think this steak was serve-able.. . So they fired a new steak and it was a lot better.  The Bearnaise sauce was spot-on, but all-in-all it was not a special dish, certainly not a $51 dish.  The Steak Frites is about 60% of the cost and looked just as good.. . We passed on dessert, had a coffee and polished off the wine.. . Would I recommend it?  Here's my thought:  I like Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  It is pricey for the quality (as well), and I think these two restaurants are pretty equivalent -- you get a bit more "scene" and "scenery" at MAG, but the quieter feel and slightly better food at Bouchon offsets that.  They are contrasts, and I'll probably be back to Bouchon with lowered expectations.
I have only been to Bouchon for breakfast/brunch, never dinner, but I have never been disappointed. On one visit to Vegas, I think my friend and I ate here every morning.... . The atmosphere is fun, and I love the location in the Venetian because it's close to almost everything. I absolutely adore the beignets, and love dipping them in chocolate/nutella. Yum!. . The food here is very heavy, so it can get to be a bit much, but it is oh so delicious. I generally order one of the specials, as they are always delectable. They always have an omelette of the day, and ordering this is always an excellent choice. The coffee is spectacular as well, and it's lovely to sit outside on the patio when the weather is nice.. . I am looking forward to trying Bouchon for dinner next time!
Brunch menu was hearty.  Our waiter attentive.  Bright atmosphere and food came out fairly quickly.  Delicious entries.  We had a hotel guest 15% coupon that we left in the room. We had already handed over card and signed bill when we remembered.  Although we could have easily gone upstairs to retrieve it, they would not readjust receipt.  That sucked.  Note to all; dont forget your coupons.
While we were in Vegas, our friends recommended coming to Bouchon. It was actually already on my list, so we agreed to meet up with them at 12:30 on Sunday for Brunch. They said they'd get there early to get in line for a table as they don't take Brunch reservations. At 11:40 we get a phone call as they already got a table, so we rushed to get there as soon as possible. Luckily, even though we got there at 12:30, they weren't rushing our friends out the door, so bonus points for that.. . I had the chicken and waffles. I've never really eaten chicken and waffles. So far I've only had posh versions, and the one at Bouchon did not disappoint. The chicken was nicely cooked with delicious gravy. The vanilla butter was great and the syrup on top was nice. Everything went so well together, and I just ate the whole thing. The other half ordered the croque madame and it was delicious. Unfortunately he wasn't feeling the best due to a bit of overindulgence the day before, so he didn't enjoy it as much as he probably would have liked.. . I also had a Bloody Mary and a hibiscus bubbly drink. Both of which were really great. The coffee was delicious too. So no complaints on anything really. Great service and great food, and everything I could expect from a Bouchon restaurant.
To dine here I traveled from afar. In my relentless quest for boudin noir. As well as the finest steak tartare. My palate, it was far from glutted. I left this place completely gutted. Authentic French ? 'Tis but a ruse. And Thomas Keller - J' ACCUSE !. . . Seriously - no boudin noir, and the server said they had not had it on the menu for over a year. Nosteak tartare. As Queen Victoria once said "No pudding and no fun". . I can't complain too much as we walked in prime time Saturday evening with no reservations, got a space at the bar and enjoyed oysters and a corpse reviver.. . We went back for a final breakfast Tuesday a.m. before getting out of Dodge - breakfast was good, and the boudin blanc was decent enough ( but boudin noir it ain't !)- but it took almost an hour to get the food.. . I think in the last 10 or 12 years the rest of Vegas has caught up with what was once a stand-out.
Is it odd that i find the free bread was the most amazing thing i ate? The housemade butter was delicious and I was tempted to smuggle some home with me. The staff was super helpful and even gave us bread and butter to go. We started out with beignets, nice and hot with lots of cinnamon sugar on them. I ordered the truite grenobloise which was very rich. I could've done without the head on it though. It was served with cauliflower and croutons on top. I would definitely visit their bakery in the Venetian next time.
A SEVERE disappointment. We got there yesterday with a 10pm reservation.. . 1. The waiter never greeted us, or even introduced himself. He just walked up--leaned over my wife, and started creepily poking her menu for possibilities. . 2. The bussing staff started reaching for things to take away (even plates covered with food, still being eaten) without even asking (I don't playing like tug of war in a seemingly fancy restaurant).. 3. My main steak frites dish came LOADED with fries (not complaining) accompanied by a cold depressingly undercooked lump of meat (complaining).. 4. I asked to have the dish wrapped to go. I opened the bag this morning to find only that sad brown lump..with no fries (and there were tons left on the plate).. 5. I gave the waiter a 20% tip (which he did NOT deserve), and he never thanked us nor bid us a good night (though I had done both to him). . . The Yountville, CA establishment is worlds better. I've been to that Bouchon multiple times and had zero issues. Don't even bother with this one in Vegas.
Can I have fries with a side of steak?. . The fries here are legendary. If I had only 1 meal in vegas, I would get my ass down to Bouchon and order frites and some entree to go with it. . . We got here late but made it before the morning service ended. I had the steak n eggs - perfect medium steak with perfect sunny side ups, accompanied with sauteed potatoes fried together with caramelized onions in the steak jus. Very good.. . My companion had the rainbow trout served with cauliflower and capers. The flavors melded together beautifully.. . I ordered the frites as an addition, and we almost finished all of it. It's skinny feather light crisp and fluffy frites that are very very addictive. Words cannot do it justice.
It was truffle season and foie gras is banned in California so I had an expensive but delicious meal at Bouchon. I only ate 2.5 ounces of terrine de foie gras and a bowl of truffled mashed potatoes but it filled me up and gave me all the fat I needed for the week.. . I ate-2.5 terrine de foie gras, served in a mason jar with toast points. just perfect.. . truffled pureed potatoes-rich creamy with lots of tiny bits of truffle, expected at least a slice served on top.. . Currently they are also doing also a black or white truffle risotto, a black truffle mac and cheese.. . I was a walk-in at 5pm and ate at the bar. They have a small menu of mocktails, I tried the anti-saloon.. . The prices are higher than at the Bouchon in Napa. The space is over the top but it's Vegas and it's still more tasteful than 90 percent of the design in Vegas. . . It's on the 10th floor and you will get checked by the security if you use the patron's elevator. There is a phone for the restaurant by the Bouchon Bakery on the casino where you can call them directly to see if they have reservation or with any questions.
My review will strictly be on what I ordered:. . Croque Madame - Creamy, rich, yet simple.  If you love ham, this is the perfect breakfast/brunch item for you.  In short, it is a ham and cheese sandwich made with toasted brioche and smothered with bechamel and a sunny side up egg.  Perfect balance.. . Quiche Lorraine - SO GOOD.  Probably on my top 5 quiche lorraine list.  Creamy, eggy, and oh the crust.... the crust was just right.  Texture held up great against the filling and had a nice flakiness.  . . Beignets - Not your traditional doughy, fluffy, chewy beignets.  More of a cakey feel, these were just ok.. . OVERALL:  Service was top notch & food came out flawless.  . . Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!
Ok, so compare to restaurants in San Francisco or Yontsville, this place would be more like a 3.5 star. The food was executed well, a tad on the salty side, but overall the chef's skill was solid. the problem is, the food wasn't very creative and there's nothing exciting about the menu. I would think Yontsville would be better, although I've never been to Bouchon there, I've been to a few others that have more exciting menus. . . however, the restaurants in Vegas in general lacks creativity. so in terms of that, this place is better than most of the other ones of the same level when I looked at the menus and that's how we decided to come here. in terms of merit, it's a solid restaurant even if the name isn't Bouchon.
A great dinning experience. Went here for dinner. Beautiful ambiance, elegant but not stuffy. Service was great; friendly helpful and efficient. Superbly executed bistro food. Duck Confit- best I have had. Roast chicken- Perfectly cooked with garnish that really pulled the flavors together. Scallops- Best scallop dish I have had. Great place for a date
Stellar restaurant in Vegas at the Palazzo (hidden on the 10th floor) where everything - from the bread to the desserts - is made with quality ingredients. This restaurant is great. 3 times I went there for breakfast or dinner and each time it was divine. Service is efficient. Staff is rather friendly and the food is definitely exceptional. 5 stars well deserved Mr Keller.
This place is really amazing. I come here for brunch or dinner pretty much every Vegas trip I go on and I've got to say that it's been consistently good. . The wine list is pretty stellar and the bar tenders are really knowledgeable about what pairs with what and they do their best to give you tastes before you buy. The prices for wine vary from inexpensive to more than what I make in a week. I've never been disappointed by any of the wines OR cocktails that I've tried here. Which are numerous. . Food: The FRIES!!! So good. They're the skinny little ones and they're wonderful. I got the mussels and fries and the sauce for the mussels was to die for! I also got the lamb over a bean ragout and I was disappointed with that dish. Way too much salt and the beans didn't make sense with the lamb- they were almost the same texture which was a little weird. The lamb was so tender that it was almost shocking! We for sure finished that!. My friend got the scallop entree and it was phenomenal!! Seriously! Very rich though. It was small, only two or three scallops, but because of the richness, we couldn't eat any more than that anyways. . We also got some mussels and clams as a starter and the sauces that came with them were outstanding. The prices were reasonable for cold seafood too. . We also tried the french onion soup and I have to say, it's the best I've ever had. It's large though, so I could have eaten it for dinner alone!!!. If you're looking for a beautiful escape from the cigarette smoke and hooker cards on the Vegas strip, come to Bouchon which is a little French oasis.
There may not be another restaurant as finely tuned, approachable, affordable, and elegant on this planet. Never a disappointment. Always an amazement.
I have been to Bouchon in Yountville and knew the food would be delicious.  Again, was blown away by the delicious food (Steak Frites and large raw seafood platter).  But what really made this trip to Bouchon memorable was how well we were treated with two tired toddlers in tow.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 10 PM without reservations (we just arrived in town, starving, otherwise the kids would have been in bed) looking for a good meal.  Our hostess greeted us warmly and even gave our oldest a Ratatouille coloring book and crayons.  That is how I knew they were truly welcoming to children - great for a French restaurant to take that little step to welcome children!  Tables were spaced well so that when the inevitable meltdown occurred it wasn't disruptive to the other diners (or so their smiles and kind words said).  I left Bouchon even more impressed than before, with plans to visit again soon.  It is always a challenge to find an upscale restaurant with delicious food that will welcome young children.  Already a favorite due to the excellent cuisine, Bouchon may be my new favorite restaurant after how well we were treated.  I will definitely be back.  (And those fries on the Steak Frites dinner - probably the best I have ever had.  Like County Fair fries perfected.)  Mmmm.  (And on a similar note - try Bouchon Bakery for some amazing cookies - the ones fashioned after Oreo's and Nutter Butter are delicious, as are the macarons.)
Oh, this one hurt. . I'm a TK fan of epic proportions and consider the French Laundry to be THE meal against which all others shall be compared. So, during our stay in Las Vegas we, of course, made reservations at Bouchon. It was a last minute trip and we were happy to get a seating for later on the night of our arrival. That should have been my first clue. . To go to the French Laundry in Napa, you need to have been born there, be related to Mr. Keller or, like me, plan a trip around the first date they can fit you in. Mine was a 3 month wait. I hit high season, I guess.. So, we got a prime 9pm seating on a Friday night at the last minute (!). We arrived and saw that it was maybe half full. It's a pretty spot inside the lovely Venetian hotel. Very clubby, masculine room with a beautiful wood paneling. We were seated right away.. The staff began to serve us out of order- water then dinner order then drink order then meal delivery THEN wine order. There are definite drawbacks to large waitstaff teams.. So, after all these years of waiting, what did I order? Soup. Why? They sold out of the other things I wanted to have! 9pm in Vegas is early. How many short ribs plates did you have - 3? What was left was a fairly large collection of dishes that did NOT interest me. It was very heavy in the fois gras, pate, caviar for appetizers. The remaining dinner options weren't that varied: trout, halibut, salmon and collections featuring mussels, octopus, crab. When you have an allergy to shellfish, sometimes even fish turns you off. I used to adore seafood but since I developed an allergy that can kill me, it's taken the bloom of the rose, so to say.. The menu did have a chicken offering (accompanied by mustard spaetzel), gnocchi with vegetables and - weirdly - a Croque Madame.  My husband ordered the steak. I ordered the soup du jour: cauliflower. The other specials? Salmon tartar and some other fish. I was sad, bordering on angry. Fish? I didn't realize they only served FISH and then throwaways if you didn't want fish. Oh, you can get accompaniments: shellfish. And fish. . So, the steak arrived. It was cooked perfectly, tasted very good. It shared the plate with a mound of shoestring potatoes. Yes, Ore Ida fries, pale and lovely. No garnish. Nothing else. $51 for a 12oz. Rib eye and shoestring fries. My soup? White pureed cauliflower with a plop of crime fraiche and a couple foraged florets. They apologized as soon as they served it to me saying that his steak took so long to cook. Basically, "we screwed up, sorry it's cold." At this point, I was so heartbroken that I just wanted to leave. The soup wasn't good (roasted vegetables aren't at their best when sitting on a hot liquid for 20 minutes!), I only had water to drink because I didn't order wine and they never asked me if I wanted something else. Actually, I said I'm "just a Diet Coke girl!" but that wasn't enough of a hint - and I wasn't trying to be subversive to see if they'd pick up on it. It was just a comment when served with water that I'd be ordering something else.. The bill: just about $120. For ok steak, Ore Ida fries, bad soup, a glass of wine and water.. BOUCHON, YOU KILLED ME! I was waiting with anticipation to go to you! It was part of my agreeing to go to Vegas: a Thomas Keller restaurant. It was AWFUL. I felt like I was a know-nothing Neanderthal that didn't know what "good food" was. I'm allergic to seafood. Sorry about that. I thought I'd order the short ribs or the lamb but you didn't have that. Sorry for not adapting to your desire that I should eat more fish.. Soup and water. Wow.. UPDATE:. They made good on their promise to fix it (after I complained to the manager and the Venetian customer service people. Everyone was shocked that I was unhappy.) and we went to breakfast the next day where we were inundated with very expensive goodies -  granola yogurt, a tray of pastries, mimosas, whatever we wanted on the menu, etc. Those were all good except....I can't eat sugar. The 2 things in the world I can't eat, shellfish and sugar, and that's what I got. I felt so picky but I know I'm not really. In the end, I really couldn't eat anything at BOUCHON. It was nice for them to offer to make up our horrible dinner experience to us but how many people want a 4-star $120 breakfast for 2"? We should have gotten another dinner. As it was, I ate my scrambled eggs and a few bites of yogurt. That makes it mighty expensive scrambled eggs. . More than disappointing, this restaurant experience actually made me sad.
My favorite spot in Las Vegas. Like the rest of Thomas Keller's restaurants, this one is about as close to perfect as you can get from the moment you walk through the entrance. From the water to the butter to the napkins it is all completely thought out and lovely. I am a sucker for the steak frites, but this last visit I devoured a veal chop that was without peer.
This is a review for a breakfast from March 2013. While the food (with the exception of the burnt beignets) was excellent, the service was horrible. Don't know (or care) if my waitress was having a bad day, but she was nasty! She was argumentative, wouldn't refill my coffee (although I was able to ask other servers to do so), and wouldn't clear empty plates from the table. Incredibly disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant. Won't be back.
On a recent CES visit, I was able to procure a reservation for 4 at 10 pm on a Friday night.  Great!  I have cooked with Bouchon and various Thomas Keller Sous Vide cookbooks and was looking forward to this.  I had ordered seared Foie gras and Coquille St. Jacques.  The Foie Gras must have been seared in a clear vegetable oil and was bland.  The Coquille St. Jacques?  It must have come from a starvation diet recipe.  Two 1.5 ounces of scallops, and I am being generous on my estimation, on a small bed of sauerkraut for $29.00. It wasn't enough even for an appetizer.  The sauce, and it was a just a sauce, was bland and uninteresting too.  It neither tasted of cheese base or an hint of Pernod or wine.  . My friends had Leg of Lamb stew with white beans.  I am sure that the leg of lamb was cooked separately by the sous vide method and the beans were stewed separately.  There was not a hint of jus from the leg of lamb in the white beans, and the beans were undercooked.  Needless to say, my friends were not impressed.  I was embarrassed for suggesting the Bouchon Bistro to my friends. On an average evening, anyone with some culinary skill could cook better.  Very disappointed.
Coming in, I had such high hopes. I mean, a Thomas Keller restaurant!. . Made reservations for a Sat at 8:30pm, and it was busy but not packed. . . The Bouchon experience started off with warm pistachios and a DELICIOUS serving of their bread. O.M.G. the bread was perfectly crisp and flavorful. I knew great things were going to follow suit.. . For my starter, I ordered the pumpkin soup. It was ok. Could have used more flavor.. . My entree was one of the specials, pork belly. The pork belly had a nice salty flavor on top, but when I bit further in, the pork was actually kind of cold on the top layer and warm at the bottom layer (maybe warmed up by the vegetables). What the? I ate it anyway insisting to myself that maybe this was the way it was supposed to be served, but every bite was awkwardly cold. When the server finally came by when I was halfway through, I asked about the temperature, and he wasn't sure why it was cold...maybe it was from sitting out too long he said. That just showed poor preparation for this fine dining establishment if it were the case. Despite that temperature issue, the dish was good. The pork belly melted in my mouth.. . Another dish that someone got was the roast chicken that the server (and many other people in the restaurant raved about). When we finally tasted it, it was just ok. The skin was deliciously crispy, but the breast meat was quite dry. Not something you would expect for a $30 dish. . . I think the favorites at the table were the steak frites. One piece of seasoned steak with a huge mound of frites.. . Didn't try dessert so can't say much about that. The service was top notch though overall.
It was a wonderful treat to eat breakfast here. Everything we had was delicious, definitely would come back.
I went back this last weekend and shared the cinnamon apple oatmeal and corned beef hash. I'm not sure what they do to their oatmeal, but this was by far the best oatmeal I've ever had! Then the corned beef hash came out...what a dream. Not too greasy, the potatoes were crispy yum! I will definitely make a trip to the Beverly HIlls location for their brunch.
It was alright.  The pictures we saw on yelp inspired us to go.  The service and ambiance was great but the food was a tad bit underwhelming.  . . I would give it a second shot as there were other items that sounded good but as of now 3 stars from me. . . Liquor and wine list is very extensive which is a plus.
The bread, butter, and REAL jam (especially peach!) is really amazing. I could come in and happily have that as my meal.. . I really want to give the restaurant 4 stars, because everyone in our party of eight found her meal delicious. The chicken and waffles are something special because of the bacon bits in the waffles and the whipped butter (and syrup) that comes with it. Also, the chicken isn't fried chicken. However, service at the restaurant is Lord-help-them, S - L - O - O - O - W. Polite, but S - L - O - O - O - W. Helpful, but S - L - O - O - O - W. So S - L - O - O - O - W.
I cannot believe Thomas Keller has his name on this restaurant. I visited this restaurant with a co-worker on the evening of 1/10/14. I chose this place because it was a Thomas Keller restaurant and am a bit of a foodie. My co-worker agreed to go with me even though she is not a big foodie and would have been fine with us having dinner at our hotel. What a disappointment, I wish we would have stayed at our own hotel for dinner. . . First we were sat in the middle of 2 huge tables (one table was a large family of 12+ members and the other table was a group of 7 guys which I could touch them from my chair and hear their entire conversation). The waiter had to keep walking behind us to get to the table of 7 which was ridiculous! Our server was one of the food runners because we could never find our server to ask for bread, water or our check.. . I ordered a glass of chardonnay and it was disgusting. I cannot tell you anything about my wine because my waiter never told me the name, region or anything on my glass. This of course was brought by a runner. . . For an appetizer I order a beef carpaccio which was that nights special. BLAND. Of course the toasted baguette that accompanied this appetizer was good. . . The bread that brought to the table before our dinner arrived was delicious. Thank goodness this was good otherwise we probably would have left starving. . . The dinner specials were nothing fantastic so I ordered the chicken...my thought was this was supposed to reflect Thomas Keller's favorite dishes in France and when I think of France I think pastries, bread & chicken. Well I have made better chicken in my own kitchen than what I was served. Thomas Keller needs to go here and take the salt out of this kitchen because whoever is cooking there is using WAY TOO MUCH SALT! The chicken was atop some greens which you couldn't really taste because of the overwhelming amount of saltiness in the dish. . . Of course I would have loved to order dessert but was never even asked if we wanted any.... maybe they don't serve dessert. Who knows...... . The manager (at least I think she was a manager) brought our check to me and I decided to share with her my experience in this "Michelin" starred restaurant. To say she was aloof would be an understatement. Maybe I am dense but to me a Michelin starred restaurant should be about the experience and you certainly should not have to ask for water or bread at one of these establishments. Of course the wonderful manager did comp our wine off our bill, but not a word about any of the other points I brought to her attention. I felt since we were only a table of 2 what I thought did not matter to her or obviously the waiter who spent his entire time at the large family table. . . Since returning to Texas after this short work trip to Las Vegas I have figured out two things have really bothered me about my experience. . . 1. I have contacted the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group requesting to speak to someone about my experience and as of today 1/23/14 nobody has bothered to contact me by phone or email.. . 2. And I think this is the most disappointing.... one of my "Bucket List" items was for myself and my husband to visit "The French Laundry" and have the full experience of this culinary master's food. But now I wonder would I be as equally disappointed in that establishment too? If I know a dinner will be $1,000.00+ I expect the food to be impeccable, but if you are willing to tie your name to the restaurant I just spent $75.00+ for my single meal (not including my co-workers meal) and tried to share what a horrible experience I had and felt like that did not matter I think I will have to rethink where this bucket list dinner should be at.
By far the best costumer service I have ever received at a restaurant.  Our server was fantastic!. . First, they told us our wait would be 45 minutes, but it only ended up being 20.  As soon as we sat down, our server was at our table taking our drink orders.  She was extremely polite and made some excellent food recommendations.  . . After ordering, our food came out but they accidentally forgot my friend's chicken and waffle plate.  When they realized their error, our server apologized profusely.  Then,  the manager came over and did the same.  He even comped my friend's meal and asked us if we wanted to get our dishes remade (not even reheated!) so that we could all eat our fresh meals together.  We didn't ask them to do that because the lag time was probably only 5 minutes and we had already chowed down.. . The food was delicious and our meal ended with complimentary coffee to go.  . . We will definitely return!
We came here for breakfast during our trip.  The view was nice.  I had the Oeuf, which came with 2 brioche slices of bread, eggs any style, 2 potato croquettes, and a side of your meat choices (sausages or bacon), and I, of course, chose the bacon.  The brioche toasts were a little dry, the 2 potato croquettes were quite nice (dipped in ketchup), poached egg was fine, and the side of bacon was nice and crispy.  My friend had the Bouchon French Toast, and that tasted something in between a custardy bread budding mixed with flan flavorings.  I was pleasantly surprised with the miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce!
This place was amazing. Our waitress was great and on the ball. The bread they give you is amazing. We got the duck confit for an appetizer as well as a cheese plate. Both very good. My beet salad was fresh. My husband got the steak and fries and I had the lamb. I would come back here for sure!
Very good place. The Gnocchi a la Parisienne was a unexpected change; I am used to creamy, cheesy Italian Gnocchi, but this one was a drier, more olive oil oriented Gnocchi. It was very delicious, just something that threw me off. . . The location is a bit confusing especially if you are a first-time in the Venetian, but hey it is right next to the pool, so at least it has a great view, especially for dinner. Our waiter, though explained he lost his voice, was attentive and funny. . . The only small gripe is that the creme brulee was on the watery side, not as great as what I had at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.
Ermagawd.. If you love carbs, you need to come to here.. I am not going to tell you anything that the hundreds of other reviews have not already stated.  Bottom line?  This place is GOOD!. Celebrating the b/f's birthday weekend and having already eaten way too much, we walked from our staycation hotel to the Venetian early Sunday morning to beat the brunch rush.  Arriving at precisely 7:52am, there was no wait. We thought they opened at 8:00am, but they are actually open at 7:00am on Saturday and Sunday.  . This was our first time here and we may not be coming back for a while since it's such an indulgence for us, so we decided to just go for it.  We began with the pastry basket, where you can order four different pastries.  We chose a croissant, pain au chocolat, raspberry beignets, and the lemon and currant scone.  BUT, before that, our fantastic waiter, Aaron, brought us some Epi bread and butter; let's get this carb party started!  There were crumbs all over the table, but there's no elegant way to eat flaky croissants, not to mention the other delightful pastries in the basket.. For the main course, I had the Croque Madame, a dish I'd only read about and seen pictures of until this point.  It did not disappoint, with the ham, the cheese, and the egg. I even ate some of the frites, something I try to avoid in real life now. The b/f had the chicken and waffles and that was also so tasty, a wonderful combination of flavors with syrup.  . The restaurant itself is decorated just like a French bistro that you could be in Paris, not Vegas.  The service was top-notch.  All I needed to make the experience complete was to hear "La Vie en Rose" playing on the music system.
Seriously seriously seriously not impressed. I went to the Bouchon in LA for dineLA and liked it better than this, despite being told numerous times that the Bouchon in Vegas was infinitely better. . . To preface my review - I went with a party of 11, for Brunch on a Sunday, so maybe brunch is just in general less impressive, or maybe a party of 11 is just too much to handle. I don't know.. . My friends waited about an hour to 1.5 hours for a table on Sunday (during a long weekend, so it may not speak for the normal Sunday wait), and we were finally seated around 1pm Friday. The restaurant was still fairly busy, and we were seated in a private dining room.. . First of all, the service was extremely slow. After our waters were brought, the waiter didn't come back for another 15-20 minutes to take our order. Most of the table ordered the famed Chicken and Waffles, while two people ordered trout (one without capers), and two ordered the omelet (one vegetarian with a side of fruit). I ordered foie gras, which they only had as a cold pate that day, along with my chicken and waffles.. . The bread that was brought was decent, but the jam is delicious! It was probably the highlight of my meal, actually, especially when it topped a butter-smothered slice of bread.. . When our orders FINALLY arrived, they had somehow confused where everyone was seated, so everyone had to pass their dish down to someone else. I'd accept this at an Olive Garden, but not at a restaurant as esteemed (and as expensive) as Bouchon. Then, they swapped the plates of the two people who had ordered the trout.  Finally, the omelets came... and the vegetarian got the side of fruit with the meat-filled omelet, while my bf got a side of sausages with the vegetarian omelet! Luckily the vegetarian wasn't one to go nuts if she accidentally ate meat, but had the mix-up been for something like a food allergy, it would have been disastrous. . . The pate I got was very disappointing. It was served in a glass jar with a side of crusty bread. When I say crusty, I mean really really, cut yourself biting into it type of crusty. My boyfriend actually sustained a cut from the bread. The pate itself was too salty, had a layer of something that resembled congealed fat over it, and was definitely not a consistent color. . . The chicken and waffles came with a boat of gravy, as well as one of maple syrup. The waffle was AMAZING - it's perfectly crisp and light and everything that a waffle should be. The chicken was decent, but the seasoning was unremarkable and thus nothing to write home about. I ate the chicken dipped in the gravy, which made it a bit more satiating to my taste buds.. . The waiter never came back to ask us how our food was :( . . Overall, I expected SO much more from Bouchon. I may be back to give dinner a shot, but I probably am never going to come to Bouchon for brunch again unless I'm dragged kicking and screaming by my friends.
Decent restaurant, nothing really special.. . I had the Steak Frites. The Steak was seasoned pretty well, and the butter on top really didn't add anything. The butter was seasoned by some dried basil, though the flavour didn't really contribute to the steak overall. . The steak was oozing out juices, this meant the chefs didn't care enough to let the meat rest for 5 minutes, this left me pretty disappointed and it was very messy to eat because of it.. . I liked the frites texture, it was perfectly crisp on the outside an so fluffy on the inside, but the problem was it was WAYYYYYYYYYYY too salty. I had to drink a cup of water with every 1 fry I ate. Another problem wasthe crispy texture I really liked on the fries disappeared when steak juices oozed out and made all the fries soggy. . Overall pretty decent place, food was ok
I can not say enough or thank this establishment enough for making my 10yr anniversary with my husband spectacular! . . We had encountered a server who wasn't having a good night, needless to say I asked if we could please move to someone who could give us more attention. . . We were then greeted with two glasses of champaign, by the manager (Aaron) who sincerely apologized and our night was about to change. . . Without writing a novel, I highly recommend this place because they truly care about their guest, the food was spectacular and the chef puts his heart into every dish (u can taste it)! I'll attach our pics :-)
While the ambiance, service, and the meals of my friends were all impeccable/great, I do have to note that the   bouillabaisse was the most oversold and underrated meal I had for a very long time for a price that I am not going to mention.
While in Vegas last Sunday 10-2-2011 on conference my friend and I stumbled upon this jewel restaurant. We sat at the bar and were hosted by a very nice and extremely helpful young lady named " Sooner".. Sooner made the experience extremely pleasant and worth the visit. Food and beverages were well coordinated. The experience and execution was excellent. This is why I love to go to Vegas.
If I asked my boyfriend before Bouchon, what his thoughts on French cuisine and French food was, he would have been indifferent or even negative towards it. I believe this experience changed his view on French food forever.. . We decided to go all out. It was my birthday dinner too, so the boyfriend really wanted to treat me out.. . Server was great. I loved that they came and explained all the different foods so thoroughly. It was an educating experience as well as a memorably delicious one as well.. . We started off with various items:. - Bread: Of course, they have bread. I loved that it was in the shape of leaves.. - Wine: We had the sauvignon blanc from Sancerre... not too sweet, not too dry. Paired well with the various food we ordered.. - Salmon tartare served with these fluffy egg whites, shallots, chives, capers, and creme fraiche: It had so much flavor! It wasn't my favorite tartare, but it was definitely one of the best I've tried.. - 6 oysters and 12 mussels: The oysters came from different regions and they had different flavors. Actually, you can see all of the seafood when you come into the restaurant. The mussels were steamed, then served cold. They were absolutely delicious! They served the seafood with lemons, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. Honestly, I don't think the mussels needed any of that.. - Foie gras saute: It is a pan-seared Hudson Valley foie gras and that day it was served with an apple cider reduction sauce. This in itself is a reason why this Bouchon beats out the Bouchon in LA or Napa Valley. California sucks in the fact that foie gras is banned. But this foie gras saute MELTS in your mouth. The few minutes it takes to eat this up will be the best few minutes of your life. Its fatty consistency is like jello, but once it hits your lips, it just becomes pure joy. The apple cider reduction was sweet and filled with spiced flavors, and just went so well with the foie and the toast. I can eat this all day. Next time I want to try the Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard... Next time.. . Entrees:. - Steak Bouchon: It's a 14 oz. New York strip, and it was grilled to a perfect medium rare. It was served with a bearnaise sauce. The sauce wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessary because the steak was aged so well and was flavorful by itself. And of course, it came withe frites. Anthony Bourdain claims that the Bouchon french fries are the best he's had in his life, including the ones served at his own restaurant. I see what he means. We upgraded to truffle fries and the frites themselves were so crispy and delicious. Somehow the entire fry itself seemed to be bursting with deliciousness. Absolute frites perfection.. - Braised pork belly: It was served on top a red wine braised cabbage with vegetables and sweet potatoes. Honestly, I have had better pork belly and the sweetness of the sides were a bit much. I feel like it would have been perfect with a bit of brightness.. . We were so full after the meal we couldn't even eat a proper dessert. We were able, however, to get a few items from the Bouchon bakery to take home. We bought an assortment of muffins and cookies. I loved the banana nut muffin as well as the coffee cake. They were all so very delicious.. . Honestly I can't wait to come back here and feast on more delicious goodness again. Actually, now I'm dying to go to Thomas Keller's even-more-famous restaurant, The French Laundry, in Napa Valley!
