The only thing this place has going for itself is the cleanliness of the restaurant.  The portions are utterly small and at outrageous prices.  I had the egg Noodle wontons and I was very disappointed.
As a concept, China Poblano is classic Jose Andres. The tapas-style menu is perfect for groups and a good selection of Mexican street food and Cantonese dim sum staples will offer something for everyone. However once price comes into the equation, things get a little worrying.. . China Poblano does a few things very well. It's hip, casual atmosphere is right at home at the Cosmopolitan and the quick service and sharing nature of the food make it a good lunch spot. . . The Good: China Poblano's tacos are easily the highlight of the menu. The braised beef barbacoa and chicken with chorizo are delicious options, but keep in mind they are quite small. The chilaquiles are another highlight with a bright tomatillo salsa and lots of melted cheese. The service was fast and friendly and the waitstaff were good about explaining each dish.. . The Bad: For as good as their Mexican options are, China Poblano struggles more with the Chinese side of the menu. The Mongolian beef salad was described as lettuce wraps on the menu, only when it arrived we discovered that wasn't the case. The beef came laden with a corn syrup sheen found only at the very best bad Chinese spots and it was very tough to chew. The restaurant's prices are high, too high for what you're getting. China Poblano is clearly catered towards to street food crowd and over $6 for a taco (2-3 bites) is too much.. . Andres is doing great things for gastronomy throughout the world and while the Mexican food at China Poblano is excellent, you pay a bit too much for the Andres stamp of approval.
At first we were skeptical of the Chinese/Mexican combination, but it was delicious and flowed effortlessly from dish to dish. For five of us, we ordered 6 dishes and a taco each and it was the perfect amount of food. The chips and guac was really amazing, but so was everything we ordered. Ourbest meal in Vegas!
This place should be avoided at all costs!  Expensive, small portions and underwhelming flavor on all dishes.  Only tried the asian food here, but everything was unacceptable!. . The food-. portions are TINY; consider everything you order as an appetizer sized.  . flavor-where did it all go?. . When Pigs Fly-came out warm not hot.  no unique flavor to speak of.  . Dan Dan Mian-joke!-no flavor; nothing special;tiny. Dancing Eggplant-1 asian eggplant-unimpressed sause. Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice -more like steamed rice.  no flavor.  worse than what your white friends can dish up. Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich-soo bad bun was the best part. . Service-none to speak of.  Couldn't fill my glass.  unattentive and clearly didn't give to be there.  . . . The good-. view of people cooking?-if your into that. . ok-. . bad-. everything from the service to the food and flavor.  if you like tiny expensive unfavorable portions this place is for you
One of my favorite spots for lunch in Vegas! I love the atmosphere. It's festive and fun without being loud and obnoxious. Their salt air margaritas are absolutely to die for, and my friend has been re-creating them perfectly for at least a year. It takes some work to make the "air," but it's totally worth it! One of my favorite drinks anywhere.. . The concept of Mexican-Asian fusion seemed a little bizarre to me at first, but there is plenty of separation on the menu if you are not an adventurous eaters. It's fun to mix and match Mexican and Asian small plates and go between.. . I have been here 3 or 4 times, and have tried a variety of dishes. Almost every dish is a small plate or appetizer, and my friends and I always get a variety of options to share. The guacamole is outstanding, and there are plenty of gluten free options (including the chips), which pleased my gluten free friends. When Pigs Fly is one of my favorite appetizers. The steamed buns are super filling, but delicious.. . I would recommend trying at least one of the sui mai options, and if you are indecisive, try the combination! The Dan Dan Mian noodles are delicious, but definitely on the heavy side. The twenty-vegetable fried rice is also a go-to, especially if you are feeling the need to eat more vegetables during your time in Vegas!. . This is a perfect spot to try with friends and explore different menu items, including the must-have salt air margaritas.
We returned to this restaurant during our December 2013 visit.  We were not disappointed.  . . We shared Queso Fundido, Beijing Glass, When Pigs Fly, Happy Family, Mongolioan Beef Lettuce and Pato Pasilla.  Each dish was wonderful.. . The waiter convinced the two birthday girls at the table to get the Mango Rice dessert.  It was amazing.  Puffed rice, mango, whipped topping and other delights.  Not a disappointed diner amongst us.
There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.. . We ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:. . Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.. . Guacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.. . Tacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.. . Lamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.. . Sui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.. . Dan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.. . Col de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.. . Shrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.. . Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.. . All in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.
Had a great meal here in Jan 2012, but our return visit this year was disappointing.  No standout dishes, nothing memorable, nothing great.  Whereas the year before we walked away totally satisfied on every level, this time out was just a letdown.. . Also, the bartender did nothing but try to push stuff down our throat.  I've never had such an aggressive server at any establishment, made us feel like we were being "sold to" -- at dinner!?!. . That said, some clever dishes, and they serve nicely sized portions.  Perhaps we came on an off-night?  Only gave it the 2nd star due to memory of the first visit.  Proceed at your own risk.
A Chinese & Mexican restaurant? It sounded like the perfect place for my husband (Hispanic) and I (Chinese), but it ended up to be a very disappointing meal. My husband has been there once. He warned me about the food wasn't that good, but we felt like I had to try at least once. . . We started with the chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy. The salsa was fine, but nothing special. We have had much better salsa in other places. . . We had three tacos. The homemade corn tortillas were great. LENGUA (beef tongue) was very delicious. The tongue was tender and the salsa was refreshing. Best thing of the night. Silencio (duck tongue) was disappointing. It was a taco with Chinese cooking style and flavors. Sadly, the flavors just didn't go well with the tortilla. Kind of weird. Pescado a la Plancha (fish) was ok. Just a fish taco. Nothing amazing. . . For dim sum, we got the traditional siu mai. $13.88 for 6 siu mai? They better be good! My husband liked them, but they were just ok for me. The filling were a bit loose. The siu mai fell apart easily after one bite. I felt that I am paying for the gold flakes more than anything. Please take away the gold flakes and give me some decent and cheap siu mai! We also had the lamb pot stickers stuck on you. I was very exciting about pot stickers, especially lamb one. Not only we can't taste the lamb, the spice seasoning overpowered everything. The spice didn't taste anything like Chinese or Mexican food. It was more like Indian flavors. Other than the crispy skins, we didn't like these at all. . . We also got the 18 MONK NOODLES. I think they have switched this out of the menu now. But it was very tasty. I like hand cut noodles, because they are usually al dente. And these noodles were. The flavors were earthy and savory. We enjoyed it. . . At the end, we paid about $65 (without tax & tips). All the food we ordered were nothing fancy. You can get all these food in a Mexican or Chinese restaurant for just half the price. I have nothing against fusion food. I love kogi. But the food in here is just not good and it is way over price! If you are thinking to come here, I urge you to go somewhere else. Jose Andres' magic just doesn't work here.
So when the server tells you "We're not a fusion restaurant. When you order your meals they come from separate kitchens" call me interested.  . . The food here is great. Maybe I was starving, but it was very tasty. I do regret not getting the queso dip(I think), dang table next to me was rubbing it in my face. . . The dan dan noodles were good, nothing to write home about. The chiqules (I butchered another dish name) was amazingly tasty. Um the Pappas were delectable. The 20 vegetable fried rice was also super yummy. And for dessert, the tapioca pudding ball thing was great. . . Me: really 20 vegetables? . . Server: "I promise you that our fried rice has 20 different local and seasonal vegetables.". . Here's the negative: price and size. . . Me: Will this fill us up?. . Server: "I always suggest each person order at least 4 items, think tapas.". . That wouldn't be a big deal if everything wasn't $9 or more. . . So in all, it is pricey (hey, its the strip) but totally worth trying if you don't mind "taking a mark" against yourself. That's casino talk, right?
I don't usually use a one star, but man, this was just bad.  So sitting down, they tell you they arent "fusion", probably do to all the reviews here, so great, we didnt want fusion anyways (cant a girl want an egg roll and cheese dip??) However place isnt Chinese nor Mexican!! To start, I just wanted a coke to drink. All they had was "Mexican coke" whats the difference other than regular coke is 2 bucks, nope this coke was 6 bucks!!! For a small little glass bottle. Just because it was imported from Mexico. So that got me off to a bad start. . The food was anything but tasty. We ordered the cheese dip. It came in a piping hot cast iron skillet, and it was just a block of cheap cheese. You know the kind you buy that refuses to melt. So you could even dip your bread in it without literally pulling the entire thing out! The other dishes we had were pretty tasteless too. We ended up going out for pizza after we spent our 80 bucks here (this place isn't cheap!). We were totallyunsatisfied customers! Would not recommend this place at all.
Came here with friends to have a quick dinner.  Note:  Make a reservation if you plan to go here Saturday night!  The wait was crazy long but luckily we were able to sit at the bar.  I didn't really know what kind of food was served here so I wasn't put off by the fact that they didn't serve Mexican/Chinese fusion like some of the other reviewers.  . . We ordered: . . 1) Chips and Salsa - Nothing special, but they were good. 2)  Carnitas Tacos - Tasty, moist, and messy...for me at least.  i liked the pork grind.. 3) Gan Pung Ji Chicken - It was the best fried chicken I had in a while!  I really liked the spicy chili sauce the most!. 4) Sui Mai, Beef with lime/daikon/watermelon radish - It was good, but nothing to write home about. :). 5) Mango rice pudding dessert (I can't remember the name) - This was really yummy!  We ordered another dessert with a chocolate figurine on top of ginger ice cream, but this one was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.. . . This place is a little on the pricy side for Mexican and Chinese food, so you have been warned.. . I'd come back here again but just not on a Saturday night.
I think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. Given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in Vegas, I would skip it. If you are a Jose Andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the Dan Dan Mian. . . First of all, the outside seating is not fun. You're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. This makes me sound like such a pansy. Not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. Also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. Not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. . . Anyway, I went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. We got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. Here's what we got and what I thought.   . . Tacos: Tinga Poblano - I mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. Not anything special at all. Also, teeny tiny. Very little chorizo. I know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. You end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. PASS. . . Dim Sum: When Pigs Fly - Ugh. I didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if I'm being honest, this is another pass. This tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! For $14! We love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. But like, it was totally standard and not special at all. PASS.  . . Noodles: Dan Dan Mian - This was pretty good. I'm a fan and if I came back I would get this again. It had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. I need to note that even though this is the one thing I will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. But I'd do it again. PLAY. . . From China: Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice - I am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. The waiter says Travel Channel liked it? Yes, ok, yes please. And then out comes this extra small portion of fried rice that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. PASS.. . From Mexico: Papas Fritas - I really didn't like this at all but to be fair I'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. Also I never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. You can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. And sometimes I forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and I try it again and it's like UGH FLEECED AGAIN. But that's neither here nor there. PASS.. . In hindsight, this really makes it sound like I hated it. Which I totally didn't, I was just very underwhelmed. As I'm originally from the DC area, I've tried several of Jose Andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. So maybe I've set the bar high because I've had such good things from his places before, or maybe I'm just extra judgey because I grew up eating both these cuisines so I've had much better at cheaper prices before? Dunno. Either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. Again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. I think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.
Great place to eat at cosmo..the chef andres is amazing and staff was awesome..tacos were so so good
I'm really surprised this place has only three stars. The boy and I came here on our last night in Vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. Since I imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, I'll break down what we had:. . Salt and Air Margarita: probably the best margarita I've ever had. . Taro chips: unbelievable. We ordered these for our ceviche, but I was gobbling them up on their own. Insanely crisp and delicious.. . Tuna Ceviche: delicious. And quite a large portion for the price. The only complaint I might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. Might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.. . Siu Mai w/ Quail Eggs: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai I've ever had. And trust me, I live in Queens in NYC, I know my Asian food. The meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.. . Pork Buns (When Pigs Fly): disappointing. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun I come across. Not necessarily bad, but not great.. . Duck Tongue Taco (Silencio): I am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. I commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. . . Beef Tendon Taco (Viva China): Outstanding. The beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. The sauce is delicious. . . Carnitas Taco: My absolute favorite. I've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. . . Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: this one was interesting. First of all, I should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so I sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. I bet that would really add to the flavor. However, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. At first I thought "meh, it's fried rice," but with each subsequent bite, I began to realize, "wait, this is the BEST FRIED RICE I'VE EVER HAD." Every bite had a new vegetable. And the boy literally licked the bowl clean. . . Chocolate Teracotta Warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with SOME kind of dessert. The presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but I could've done without this one. I have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.. . The service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. And the vibe of the place was very nice. Casual, but upscale. And not crowded. I would definitely come here again.
