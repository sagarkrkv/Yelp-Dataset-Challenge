If I was solely rating the food, this place would be a three star restaurant, but the ambiance and the structure of the restaurant really deserves my extra star.  The design of this restaurant is really very beautiful, and the outside area is absolutely lovely.  . . Our waitresses seems to have a little argument about who our table belonged to which gave me an uncomfortable feeling. . . We got the pumpkin soup and the goat cheese appetizer.  The pumpkin soup was good, too sweet for my taste, which we fixed by adding lots of black pepper.  The herbed goat cheese though, wasn't quite what I expected.  I love baked herbbed goat cheeses, and this one was cooked so long until it was almost completely liquid, and served with lots of tomatoes.  So it's more of a baked tomato goat cheese than herbs.  It was still pretty good, I was just craving one of my favorite preparations of goat cheese which this one failed to satisfy.
This is a brunch review only: it has a great atmosphere here, BUT the brunch food is so overpriced for very average quality. It was slow to arrive and portions weren't great. Nothing unique. I will admit the dinners are much better.
Fabulous food, ambiance, staff.... Love this place....
Visited this restaurant for brunch. We sat on the patio and had a mimosa & Bloody Mary before ordering. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was due to the amount given for the mimosa. I felt shorted. Other then that service was great, and very attentive. The waitress had wonderful recommendations since I was undecided on what to order. I ended up ordering the fried egg sandwich with fries. It was amazing! The roasted red peppers made the sandwich. Others with me ordered the pancake (A must order!) and egg Benedict  with procietto which was also yum! We sat and talked at our table for a while and were not rushed away. The complimentary valet was also a nice touch. Will be visiting this place again but next time for happy hour.
My wife absolutely loved it, and I thought it was good. I really enjoyed the look of the place, and the staff were very friendly. I wasn't as wowed by the food as my wife, though I'll definitely give it another go, and recommend it to people looking for a romantic place to dine out.
My wife has food allergies and sensitivities that limit the restaurants we can visit. But a friends of ours encouraged us to try this place as it has a variety of Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-free and Dairy-free offerings. Yesterday had been a terrible day at work and our maintenance man told us our hot water piping had been poorly plumbed in our apartment. My wife and I had enough and needed what can only come from a good, satisfying meal and service. We had never been to St. Francis because we couldn't get reservations as needed so we decided to risk walking in on a Monday night. We couldn't be more pleased. Our service was wonderful from the kitchen staff who held the door for us, the hostess who seated us and the beautiful young man, Andrew, who served our table with charm and professionalism. We ordered the fingerling potatoes to start with and they were to die for, delicious! She had the salmon dish and it was done perfectly and so tasty. I had the meat, carrots and salad meal and OHMYGOD, it was seared and seasoned by an angel. Oh yes, we will definitely be back. Oh yes.
I came to St Francis to join friends for Happy Hour, as I am rarely in the area it was my first visit and I was instantly impressed with it's warm and intimate atmosphere. Seating is available indoors or on the heated patio with additional seating upstairs. Service was great and also accommodating in our request to stay warm but not too warm as we chose to dine outdoors braving a cool AZ evening. It's great place to join friends, is family friendly(as they paid special attention to my daughter's cherry filled drink)and is a cozy enough location for a date. I ordered the pork chili verde, topped with perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs, and a spicy roasted jalapeno, amazing! Being with a friends whom generously shared, I was able to try a bite of the large tasty meatballs, and the pumpkin soup that was like eating a sweet whipped into perfection bite of dessert. With such good food and service, St Francis is definitely worth  making a return visit!
The pork belly sandwich lived close to expectations as on the food network it was tasty and not greasy at all.  Reasonably priced as well
Andrew S was our server as he was so great!!! The drinks were amazing and the service was great
The ambience, fab drinks and finger-licking burger make this one of my fav restaurants in the area.. . Only reason I can't give them a solid 5, is because overall, The food just isn't as fabulous and consistent as it used to be. But take advice from fellow locals who visit here often, order the 'right' thing (did I mention the burger?!) and you won't be disappointed.. . Got friends in town? This is the place to bring them! . . The 2 story building has an awesome design - its got a perfect mix of exposed brick walls, large floor to ceiling windows and a retractable front glass wall that they open up on warm days. . . Best Seats - At the bar if theres just 2 of you, or outside on the pretty patio. Skip the top floor entirely - in fact, don't bother eating there at all if they try to put you upstairs. It lacks the ambience that makes St Francis special, and the service is always slower.. . Best Bevs - The Santa Rosa!!! Its the epitome of the perfect, refreshing summer drink. Smooth vodka, muddled with ruby-red grapefruit, basil and Elderflower liquor. Yum! They also do an awesome bloody mary.. . Best Bites - . French Onion Burger, Pork Chop, Salmon, Egg Sandwich, Fingerling Potatoes wih yummy aioli and Baked goat cheese.. You may be tempted by the sound of the Pork Chile Verde, and if it was a year ago, I'd say dont order anything else. But these days, it tends to come out over-cooked and chewey and lacking the yum it used to flaunt. Love burgers like me? Then you absolutely have to have the finger-licking-good St Francis French Onion burger! :) Just the burger alone is worth 5 stars! They use top quality ground beef and always cook it perfectly to order, served on a warm brioche bun, topped with smokey bacon, greens, gruyere cheese, crispy onion strings and a magic sauce. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.. . Best Times to Go - Between 3-6 for happy hour. Its quiet,  you get seated right away, and the service is always quick. I love their brunch on the weekends, especially when they have live music. Just get there early and be patient - it gets busy for brunch!. . Tip - They have an amazing wood burning fire oven and cook fresh, crunchy loafs daily - order one on your way out!
Went here for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich, it was fantastic. I will never have another chicken salad sandwich anywhere else as I'll only be disappointed. Great atmosphere as well.
Slow service. Over done burger. We actually got forgotten about. They didn't put my burger order in but put in the rest of the food which took just a minute (literally) longer than it took to get our iced teas.  . . When my burger finally arrived it was well done (I had asked for medium) so it wasn't even close to right. When we were done and paid the server brought a receipt without a line for a signature. (Not a problem for me since I wouldn't have tipped her anyway but my wife was buying.) . . Trying to leave and the complimentary valet can't get the older couple in front of us Prius started. He makes them go get their own car. Are you kidding me???. . We won't be back.
Came here for a quick late-night bite and the peppers on the appetizer menu were delicious AND ACTUALLY SPICY. My friend told me to come back here for brunch, so I'll be sure to.
I had the forbidden rice bowl, amazing.  Im craving it!!  Had some fun yummy drinks.. Also had a show, the bartender was bickering with one of waitresses, he was a jerk too!  Then i heard another bartender and that same waitress talking about what an a**hole the other one is.  I mean really is this Vanderpumps Rules?  Drama for the customers to hear...not cool.  . Dinner and drinks were great, could have done without the show just a foot away from me!
I recently took my daughter here for dinner and we had a really nice meal. As expected, it was packed on a Friday night, but we didn't wait long for a table. The kids meals are free and my daughter had the cheese pizza with a side salad. . . I ordered the pork chile verde, goat cheese app, and a side of polenta. I also had 2 cocktails and since it was happy hour, everything was relatively inexpensive. Before we left, I ordered the pork belly risotto for my husband and everything came out to $45. Very reasonable. Service was attentive, too, and humored my daughter with all of her 6 yr old ramblings and questions. We really enjoyed ourselves!
I brought my parents here from out of town after they saw it on diners, drive ins and dives - they were not disappointed. We enjoyed the crispy fingerling potatoes with the white sauce especially. My meatballs were gigantic, three is more than enough. My husband had the burger and enjoyed the toppings and the spread, my mom enjoyed the salmon and my dad went for the special roasted chicken - our table fell silent when the food arrived, always a good sign of a great meal.
Just had Sunday Brunch and ordered the Biscuit and Gravy with Eggs over medium and a Mimosa. I was dining alone so opted to sit at the outside patio bar, looking in to the main dining area. A pretty good spot for people watching. . . My order showed up promptly but was only warm... Not hot? Was confusing, as again the order was out pretty quick.I'm therefore guessing the gravy is made in bulk and just ladled over the also pre-made, but kept warm biscuit. The eggs were cooked pefectly... But rather than taken from the skillet with a spatula, the eggs were poured onto the dish with all the butter they were basted in, creating a puddle on top of the gravy. While I like butter, and the dish is not on anyone's health-conscious menu, it was visually off putting... (See photos) but only just a little. Unfortunately they must have sat in the window or been under a fan or something because they, too, were not hot but only warm. . . They next issue was the first bite I took... Which apparently was a bundle of sage or green onions? They were stringy and took some effort to chew up... Seriously chewy... I would have spit them into a paper napkin had I had one. . . Ok, all of that pickiness aside, the dish was otherwise well done. Good flavor and consistency to the gravy with large chunks of sausage and the portion was big enough without leaving me in the need for a nap.. . The only other issue was with the staff... While its early on a Sunday and the youngish hipster staff made polite acknowledgement of my presence at first, I felt quickly forgotten as I wasn't offered a refill on my beverage or given salt and pepper until I was halfway through the meal. Being a single diner (and former bartender) I easily got the impression I wasn't going to register on their radar unless I spent more or was part of alarger group. Not saying they were not friendly, just that most employees were busier with their own conversations than with the attention paid to the customers. I finished my meal and drink and sat waiting for the check a good five minutes with an empty plate and glass in front of me the whole time as well. While I may understand this at a table in the busy dining room, my server/bartender was no father than six feet from me the entire time. . . I'll go back, as again the food is good... But I'll have to lower my expectations I guess.
Finally had a chance to try this.  Loved it:  order the iron skillet pancake.  also had the farmer's market frittata.  Fabulous bloddy mary and live jazz music sunday afternoons.
Awful experience today at brunch. A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad. So gross. . It Took 30 minutes to get a Bloody Mary. Over an hour for our food. The potatoes weren't cooked all the way. We were there a total of two hours for the two of us with normal breakfast and one drink each. Waiter was nice, but no sense of urgency from anyone that worked there. . Two other women and I were in line for the restroom and one of the cooks came out wafting his nose and saying, "you might want to let it clear out a bit before anyone of you use it." And laughed and went back to the kitchen. . Not going to return or recommend anyone to eat there.
I had been wanting to try St. Francis for quite some time now. My boyfriend took me out for date night here. Let me start off by saying, if you're going on a Friday night-MAKE RESERVATIONS. We ended up waiting 45 minutes..thankfully we had cocktails and an old black & white movie to keep us occupied in the outdoor "waiting" area..is that what it's supposed to be? I couldn't tell if you were allowed to order food from there or not. . . The ambiance is upscale and trendy, with low lighting & a modern, chic interior-which I find to be typical of restaurants that are considered "American New".  I quite liked the design of this place.. . Finally, after what felt like FOR-EV-ER, we were seated (really I was just hungry & being impatient so any amount of time felt like an eternity). We ordered the housemade baguette with olive oil & waters to start with. I realize that this place was busy but it seemed like it took quite a while to get said items. In fact, we got our bread and water at the same time the table next to us did, and they were seated who knows how long before we were. I felt a small pang of empathy, which was silenced by devouring of bread. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing under the Specialties-The Forbidden Rice bowl. Considering how much we love Forbidden Rice, our expectations were quite high. We again waited quite a while for our food to arrive. The food itself is 5 stars-the vegetables were so delicious and the rice was cooked to perfection. The dressing is to die for-a great combination of sweet and spicy.. . Overall, my experience was "good" but not great. The slowness of service is what gives it a 3 star rating. I didn't expect to be at St. Francis for over 2 hours. I would return again, perhaps for brunch..or for dinner-but make reservations beforehand!
Just had the salmon and I have to say this is by far the best salmon I have ever had. It is flavored with a hint of coconut and the flavor is spot on. Do yourself a favor and order this dish if you enjoy salmon. . . The fingerling potatoes and the broccoli are also amazing. . . Great place for drinks food and overall atmosphere.
