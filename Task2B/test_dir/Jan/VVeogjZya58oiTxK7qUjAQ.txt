I love this place. I feel the best time to go without at wait is 10:30 AM on Saturday and be the 1st in line for the place to open!
Some out of town friends and I finally checked out Pizzeria Bianco in Heritage Square downtown. My friends were vegetarians and my meat-lover self was completely outvoted,so we tried a few pies that I normally wouldn't even glance at on the menu. We tried the Rosemary pizza...and I learned I'm allergic to pistachio's - who knew!?  The Margherita pizza was truly delicious - crisp, flavorful and the aroma of the basil was delightful.  We expected a long wait, and got an even longer wait.  On the plus side, it gave us more time to drink lots of wine and catch up!   I hear the wait times have improved as of late and am happy to see the expansions of this restaurant.   Looking forward to my next visit and trying new options!   Great local pizza place, proud to have Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix!
The pizza is simply amazing which I give 5 stars.  Everything else about Pizzeria Bianco is 3 stars.. Expect to wait and then wait some more for a table.  The neighboring Bianco-bar...or whatever it's called will help passing the time, but if you are a fan of beer, there isn't much to get excited about.  . If you love pizza, you need to go.  If you've never been, you need to go at least once....just don't go hungry because by the time you get a table and start eating, you might pass out of starvation.
There is becoming quite a bit of competition in the downtown area for pizza recently. That said, this place has some great pizza. Sometime there is a long wait, but they take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. There are plenty of great bars around the restaurant, so waiting is not bad at all. The pizza is interesting. Most places have basic Italian classics and Bianco has a bit more flair. I can't remember the name of the pizza I usually get, but it has pistachios on it  and it is killer! They have some good wine by the glass as well. It is definitely worth stopping by and checking out if you have the chance!
Atmosphere was great.  Located in a 100 year old red brick building.  The downside is that it is so small and the wait is so long, the servers are trying to turn the tables so quickly you don't have time enjoy the company you're dining with.  It really feels like they want you to hurry up and eat, so you can leave.. . The pizza is good but not amazing and not deserving of all the hype Pizzaria Bianco has received over the years.  If you have ever eaten at Grimaldi's it is almost identical.. . In my opinion, the best pizza in AZ is Oregano's; Their all meat pizza is on a level all by itself.
I guess I don't understand the hype. The service was very good, but the pizza was completely flavorless. The sauce was the strongest point, but the cheese and sausage were completely bland. The service earned them a third star, but I won't be going back
Nothing special, it's a little bit of cheese with flavorless sauce on a saltine cracker.  They hype is out of control with this place, don't believe it and certainly don't be one of those fools who wait 3 hours for the privilege of dining at a"pizza" spot that doesn't have pepperoni or meatballs as options, at all.  That's just not pizza.
Awesome pizza, quaint place - good for a date
I don't understand the hype. I came here b/c an article on the airplane raved about it and said it's comparable if not better than NY pizza. Well, that was all bs.. . Since I was with my carnivore boyfriend, nothing on the menu sounded good to him except the WISEGUY, which is made with caramelized onions and fennel sausage. I do wish I had tried a different pizza but I compromised since I eat everything.. . The pizza with fresh mozzarella really lacked favor. The sauce is good, I also very much enjoyed the crust, but sausage wasn't good (fennel overload) and there was no other flavor to this pizza. We also tried Sonny which was better thanks to the saltiness of the salami which the fresh moz completely lacks, but still nothing special. Unfortunately, I think $18 was too expensive for a average if not below average pizza. . . I will however say that they have EXCELLENT customer service.
Everything I imagined it would be and more. WOW, now that is pizza!!!
Ordered 2 pizzas. A Margarita and a Wiseguy which everyone raves about. $15 and $18 each.. . The Wiseguy needed a lot of help flavor wise. All 4 of us agreed it was OK at best. . . The Margarita was very good and on par with places like Cibo and Grimaldis but 100% NOT WORTH A 90 min wait.. . We planned to come to this place for 5yrs and finally did. Probably will not return. There are many MANY other great pizzas places in the Valley and this one is mostly HYPE.. . Oh yea... . No Chris Bianco. . No Parmesan. . No Crushed Red Pepper Flakes. . Pass....
All hype and lacking delivery ;-( I really wanted to love the food after hearing so much for so long about this restaurant.. . The wise guy needed more cheese and flavor for sure.. . The margarita was good when we added the prosciutto. $6 more for prosciutto.. . Not worth the hour and a half wait, and most definitely NOT the best pizza in Phoenix.  Sorry, Pizzeria Bianco,  we won't be back.
Came here a few years ago with a friend and his family while vacationing in Scottsdale, and knew early on how long the wait was going to be. We hung out at the house next door for about 90 minutes, getting progressively more hungry, but had been told how good the pizza was, so were able to keep the wait time in perspective. Wow, was it worth it. The pizza is to die for. Perfect combinations of meat, cheese, and crust, and the atmosphere is really cool as well. If you go in expecting to wait, it's totally worth it. You forget all the negatives the second you take a bite of the pizza. It really is THAT good.
This place really grew on me. It's the best in Phoenix and we are so lucky to live right down the street - sorry to the east valley folks who have to make the haul to have great food, but this Phoenix treasure is worth the drive.
Worth the wait! Get some Hop Knot next door and work up your appetite!
Best wood fired pizza around and reasonably priced. True Italian style pizza by a chef who's done his research in the old country. Locally grown ingredients that are hand selected. Used to be that Chris Bianco made every pizza by hand and the restaurant was only open evenings, but now he has turned it over to his apprentices and opens for lunch as well. This has reduced wait times and the quality is still there. They've also opened a new location making it more accessible. I go every time I visit Phoenix.. . This is not a place to go if you are hungry and in a hurry to eat. If you've got some time and enjoy a dining experience with friends, then put your name in and go next door to Bar Bianco, enjoy some drinks, appetizers, and conversation, and before you know it you'll be eating great pizza straight from the oven.
Very good pizza for Phoenix!. Eclectic style, not the old peperoni and sausage place.. The prices are a bit high for the portion size, but the area is high rent so it makes sense.. Very clean but a bit stuffy and highfalutin for a pizza joint.
On the east coast, this pizza would get 4 stars, but on the west it is 5 star pizza at its finest. Decent dough, a nice bar next door, no car traffic. Great atmosphere.. I did not like that the valet is required for parking, nor the fact that I tipped him when I pulled in, then he hovered me for a tip upon leaving.  Holding my door open was a bit pushy. Really? I can't park myself and walk the extra 6 feet?. I got the rosa pizza, which I would not recommend (though it was good), but the verde pizza my date ordered was delicious. I also ordered the caprese salad which was excellent. My date had the prosciutto, but it was cooked, an absolute no-no. Next time, I will be ordering the verde and yes, there will be a next time...though I will be parking elsewhere.
Its a good place to share the portions, for 2 people we split a salad and pizza. We got the pizza Rosa which was very good! good food and good atmosphere
Over priced and there is actually better out there.  Plus on a weekend you could wait up to 2-3 hours for a pizza. I got better things to do with my time.
Came for a late lunch, early dinner on a Saturday after the car show at the convention center. It was busy down town, so even at 230/3, we hade a 40 minute wait or so. We started at bar bianco next door with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the hard apple cider -really good and we shared the cheese plate and the ricotta crepes. Yum! The Bianco Dinapoli tomato sauce with the crepes was really good, we dipped our bread/crackers in it. . Once our table was ready they called us over to the restaurant. We had a table for 2 inside, it's a bit small inside, making it pretty cosy. . We ordered just the Rosa pizza, the one with pistachios. It was really good. Good medium size ish pizza with great flavor. Good for 2 to share. While I did like the bar, the appetizers, pizza, and the location...I'm just not sure I want to wait 40 mins to 2 hours to get in every time.
Hands Down the best Pizza in AZ.  Had Sunny Boy and Wise Guy.  Everything from the bread to the sauce and ingredients.   A-1.
it was mid-week and on a whim, we decided to try Pizzeria Bianco.  The wait was only 5 min (very unusual!) for 2 of us.  Large parties can wait  45 min-2 hrs.  We ordered a pizza and the server/hostess asked if we were "eating lightly".  We didn't really know what she meant and went with the 1 pizza.  About 25 min+, our 12" Margherita pizza came out.  It was fine for us as I have a little appetite.  My husband loves NY pizza and thought this was just as good.  Thin crust, easy on the cheese.  I thought there might be heirloom tomatoes on top but none of that.  We agree that the prices are a bit high.  The street parking is difficult but there is underground parking available.   We would like to try the other locations to see if it is the same.  The location off Camelback at least has a large parking lot.
Great service. Seems to be a very popular place. I love the style of pizza they serve, but I felt our pizza was just good, not amazing. I would be back if I happen to be in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to score a table.
If you love pizza this is the place to get it.. . Arugula on pizza has got to be the best discovery since blue berry syrup. OH SO YUMMY!
I feel that this place is very overrated.  The wait is ridiculous if you try going for dinner and I think the food is so-so.  I would prefer to go to Cibo over Pizzeria Bianco.
I have been to Bianco 3 times over the past 3 years. It is not worth the 2-3 hour wait. If you can get in with no wait then it would only be about 3 stars. There are way better pizza places in the Phoenix area. See my reviews for better places.
Pizzeria Bianco was a such a nice treat that was nestled away from the convention center where my conference was taking place.  I was in Phoenix for 7 days and at at Bianco 2x.  It was so nice and the atmosphere is really easy and fun.  I didn't order the GF pizza this time around but I had the olives, which were killer.  The olives were so good the second time around we ordered 2 plates of them! mm... I also had the salad with the fennel and it was absolutely delicious.  It was dressed perfectly, not too light and not too heavy... the salad was just refreshing.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also had a side of salami and that was also great.  The pieces were cut thinly and I really enjoyed the salami with the olives and even my salad.  Awesome!  My dad had the Sonny Boy pizza but he subbed in sausage. The sausage was delicious... I stole a few pieces off of his pizza.  Bianco is fast, easy, affordable and the obvious, Delicious!  Go there!  If you live in Phoenix, or are visiting!  I highly recommend.. . Also, we did not encounter the so called 2-hr wait people in the area talked about.  I guess we got lucky, but were also there during the week days and during work hours.. . Enjoy Pizza Lovers!
