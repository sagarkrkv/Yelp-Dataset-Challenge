Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!. . What an amazing place.  Expensive YES but spectacular rooms and spectacular service.  I spent my 30th birthday here and I did NOT want to leave.. . The hotel has plenty of slots, table games, restaurants, entertainment, shopping.  Just something for everyone.  We saw Rock of Ages here and we had the best time.  The customer service was also great.  When we couldn't find our room (because the building is MASSSSSSIVE) an employee noticed and offered to walk us alllll the way to the other side (felt like miles) to the door of our room.  When we tipped him for being so kind, he refused.  Super classy.. . The rooms were beautiful --we felt like royalty.  The bathroom had a vanity with a chair, a hot tub, and a television in addition to a separate shower.  No noise from the outside but the place is so big that it's easy to get lost.. . Would live at this hotel if I could.
Let me start by saying that this hotel is gorgeous. The interior and exterior of it beautiful, with the Venice-like decorations and the stream running through the shopping area with ride-able gondolas. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the bathroom is lovely with a bathtub, shower, two sinks, and a vanity table. The shampoos and conditioners were good and having three TVs was definitely a plus. You could fit 5-6 people per room if you wanted to. The price is a bit expensive, but the rooms and the ambiance of the hotel are pretty worth it. . . I stayed here over the Christmas holiday and they had an ice skating rink and a beautifully lit up tree outside of the hotel. They also have various performances outside as well. . . My only complaint is that the hotel service takes forever. If you ask for more towels, blankets, etc, it takes about 30-45 minutes to get to you. Same with the bell-hop luggage service.
If you have never been to Venice, Italy, come to Venetian hotel, just to get a little taste of it first!. . Love all the painting on the ceiling. Love the grand lobby area. Casino is totally crowded, a lot of action happening!. . Many good restaurants in the hotel. Love the Canal Shops. While you are shopping, don't forget to check out the gondola~ Great picture spot!!
I love this hotel. It's basically it's own world and you wouldn't even need to leave the hotel if you didn't want to. Some of my favorite restaurants are in this hotel and the Palazzo (Carnevino, B & B, etc.), and I absolutely adore the Canyon Ranch Spa. . . The rooms are beautiful and well maintained, and I find the beds to be particularly comfy. The bathrooms have a luxurious feel to them, and I love the fluffy white towels.. . Walking around the hotel is really fun, as they have attempted to re-create Venice with the river running through the central concourse and the gondolas and the gondoliers with their jaunty black hats. There is always some sort of entertainment going on, and there is always something to do for entertainment.. . I highly recommend this hotel. But again, if you hate the smell of smoke and want to avoid casinos, you have to walk through the casino to get to all of the hotel rooms. Also, I can't forget to mention the beautiful pool. There is plenty of seating, and spring and fall are the perfect times to visit to enjoy the out of doors and pool area without suffocating due to the heat.
We recently stayed at The Venetian for a week over Christmas/New Years. We had a delightful time! We've stayed at the Luxor and Paris before so this was our first time at The Venetian. I would come back anytime!. . The rooms were huge (we had a suite with a huge bathroom, bed area, and living room area). Everything was clean and well kept. The bathroom was spacious and luxurious, with a huge tub and TV. Our room has 2 TVs which was totally unnecessary but really nice. The closet space was good. I wish there was a dresser with drawers and not a cabinet under the TV for clothes, oh well. I heard some noise from our neighbors but not a ton. Wifi was spotty the entire time, I did not use it at all.. . The staff were all extremely nice. Housekeeping was a little spotty - we called once for extra towels and it took 45 minutes to get them. I also noticed our room was cleaned at a different time each day so it was hard to know if we would be coming back in the middle of our service whenever we came back to the room.. . The casino is nice and huge. The restaurants and shopping options are great. The connection to the Palazzo and Grand Canal Shoppes is extremely convenient. I really liked the location too - I thought The Venetian might be too far at the end of the Strip but it wasn't bad (a quick walk to the Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, & Caesars, a longer walk to Paris, MGM, Aria, and a very long walk to Mandalay Bay).. . The spa and gym (Canyon Ranch) was amazing. Access to the fitness center is no extra charge with the included resort fee if you stay at The Venetian ($28/day). A day pass for the spa facilities alone is $25/day (a total steal!). Treatments are obviously extra. The spa and gym were huge, clean, and more impressive than I had anticipated.. . A lovely, luxurious Vegas hotel. I loved every minute of our stay.
We did not stay or gamble here, but their guest services desk were extremely helpful and probably have earned a future customer with me.
The sprawling Venetian/Palazzo complex may well boast the best collection of restaurants in Las Vegas. From the low-end (Grimaldi's, which is excellent) to the high-end (Bouchon, which is transcendent), you can live here for a month and not even come close to tackling all the food.. . That, coupled with the shopping of the Canal Shoppes, the suites themselves, and the Canyon Ranch Spa, makes the Venetian my go-to for hotels from here on out.. . The suites are big, modern and kept immaculately clean. Each of the standard suites has a bathtub and shower in the sprawling bathrooms, and a pair of televisions in the tiered main area. It felt homey, as any place with an excellent bed and nice linens can feel.. . While all those big things that I've already mentioned have strongly colored my experience, the smaller things made the Venetian such a gem of a place for me. There is an Avis car rental on-site, if you want to take daytrips. And at the base of the tower I stayed in was a Bouchon Bakery, which is perfect for a quick and outstanding breakfast.. . Overall, a wonderful place. Food, spa, casino, shopping, rooms. Everything about it was great.
love this hotel. very nice suit room. even the sofa bed was comfortable. i think their casino is the best one on the strip. casino is high ceiling, bright and not stink at all.
Only in Vegas can you go from the canals of Italy to a Chinese New Year display to a boring conference room in less than five minutes.. . The Venetian is a multi-story, sprawling mass of diverse restaurants and attractions. The free shows are nice, as are the more upscale shops (Kenneth Cole, Godiva, etc.). Still, it cost close to $20 to ride the canals -- little pricy, don't you think?
I stayed here and there was construction outside my window, I called to complain, and they gave me $100 food  credit.  I order room service with the credit and got food poisoning. Lesson learned, do not order room service in a vegas mega hotel with 10,000 rooms, its like eating on a cruise ship, you are play Russian roulette.
First came here when I was 10 years old and I fell in love with it. I have so many memories in this hotel. Now I'm an adult and whenever I visit Vegas I stay here. The rooms are great and comfortable. The place is so beautiful in my opinion. Although, when I last visited I noticed SO MANY COUPLES AND NEWLYWEDS. I was bummed along with my sister because we were looking to see some cute guys lol. We were not allowed to go to bars or clubs (not 21), so we sat in the lobby and we just saw couples pass in large numbers. So all the single ladies who are looking for some fun you might look somewhere else. But we passed by the TAO nightclub and we noticed many singles but once again it was restricted for us. In the end The Venetian is my favorite hotel of Las Vegas and I can't say I will ever stay anywhere else when I visits hopefully this year.
I loved loved this hotel! Absolutely stunning and the suite was SWEET!! Spacious, elite feel, marble floors, plush beds, multiple tvs, sunken living area, grandeur bath! I loved everything about this space especially the price! Got. Great deal from Jetsetter!! It's was a steal. I was initially pressed to stay at the bellagio but the rate was better at the Venetian so I can only imagine what the rooms look like at the bellagio! I am eager to find out! Vegas baby!! November was the perfect time to visit! Not too hot, not too cold!
Our daughter stayed one night here for her Las Vegas wedding. The hotel manager upgraded her reservation by giving her a 1700sq ft suite on the 30th floor for the same price as the king standard room. The hotel then brought up a room service breakfast that they said was divine!  I called the front desk on Friday evening to ask for a late check out for them on Saturday and while I asked for noon instead of 11:00am, the hotel gave us a 2pm check out free of charge!!
It's one of the best.  We cruised through here a few years ago while staying at the Encore and just due to the fact the it smelled so clean (no smoke smell) I swore this is where we would stay on our next trip.  We paid for a nice room for a reasonable price and was offered to upgrade to the towers.  Highly recommend doing that.  Since we already had a discount for booking flight and hotel, we just applied that savings to the upgrade.  You are so removed from the casino and it smoke free and quiet!  My only pet peeve with this place any ofthem that consider themselves a "resort" don't Charge me a resort fee per night when I did not ask you to use the facilities.  I came to gamble, eat, drink and see a show, not work out.
I purchased a Groupon to the NatGeo Photo exhibit last year.  I couldn't attend, however, held onto the Groupon because I wanted to see if I could apply the amount paid to a ticket for the same event that returned less than a year later.  . . Calling the box office with this simple question, the rep sounded combative, and made an ASSumption that I expected her to do something over the phone.   I just wanted a simple answer.  All she had to say is go ask in person.  I said fine.  I asked her if she happened to know when tickets were going to be available for the Epicurean Affair.  Once again - "We don't know when, you have to ask the front in person.  We're just the call center."  This is the box office number listed on the website and they don't know anything about their future events?  Why have a call center if they tell you to get your answers "in person" ?. . I think the only function of the box office call center is to sell tickets.  As far as answering questions, they're useless.
I think I might have outgrown this hotel. I used to come here when I was in my mid-teen years. Yeah, "midteen" years, I don't even know if that's a thing. Anyway, the setting of this hotel might be a bit too much "romance" for me. I say this because of the boats with the singing captains moving around the place and just the atmosphere of it all. I give it a four because it is still an amazinghotel and I know I will definitely be back eventually, just probably not anytime soon because I'd like to check out some of the other hotels first, of course.
