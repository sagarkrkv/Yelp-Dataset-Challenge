Decent.  I had no clue this place was so spacious for a relatively small airport.  I loved the rocking chair seating options throughout the terminals.  The bathrooms were clean...though I wasn't sure how I felt about the old school bathroom attendee.  Dates the place....and awkward in an airport setting.  . . It was easy enough to find my way around.  Loved that they had a Jamba Juice, a variety of sit down restaurant options, and some shops.  . . I really didn't like that you have to fight your way through the crowd of people just passing through security and the waves making their way between terminals.  That security section really needs to be pushed back a bit.  . . The absence of outlets at my gate wasn't all that grand, either....and I still don't know why we had to deplane on the tarmac, especially when we were on a plane large enough to have a proper First Class section.  They also didn't have enough staff to make it clear where to go to get inside of the airport.  We needed at least one person at the plane and another at the airport door.. . Still, I'm surprised that I really didn't mind this airport.
Why 4 stars? Because I don't have many complaints.. .    ---   ---   ---. . It's hard to review an airport after just spending a layover or two there. But here's what I know.. . 1) I had my first Bo Jangles experience here. . . 2) This place is the people mover capital of the world.. . #2 is unofficial, but my God... there are more people movers than people here.
I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!
Well, it looks like I will be seeing a lot of Charlotte Douglas. I've spent the past 2.5 years flying out of my little puddle-jumper airport of TVC and although lovely, new, small and clean, it basically just flies to Detroit and Chicago (and other places nobody goes, like Ohio)- so I'm thrilled to be living in CLT for a bit and have a real, actual, international airport.. . I flew in a couple of weeks ago and flew out yesterday- only to fly back on Friday to return to Charlotte. No complains during my arrival- luggage came relatively quick and my boyfriend illegally parked to pick me up with no problems at all. Hooray for illegal parking.. . I was pleasantly surprised to find myself qualified for "TSA pre-check" or whatever during my Tuesday morning departure, which was great since I didn't have to take off my shoes, coat, or take out my laptop. Apparently I am a "low risk" traveler, maybe because I never beep when I go through security, fly several times every month or two and am a tiny blonde female. Who really knows.. . In any case, security was a breeze and I quickly found my gate, right next to a couple of restaurants. I passed a Starbucks and other various breakfast spots on my way there, but was glad to find a breakfast sandwich place right next to where I was flying out of. Don't you hate when you find your gate and then realize all the good coffee and food spots are way way down the concourse? Me too.. . I like this airport. It's not crazy big like ORD, it isn't spread out ridiculously like DTW and is not filthy like LGA. I think it's safe to say Charlotte Douglas is a little gem in the south east- not to mention only 10-15 minutes away from my current place.. . Knocking a star because everyone keeps talking about free Wifi, but I couldn't connect. I pay for Boingo since I fly so often, yet they don't have that service there.
The airport is going thru some major remodeling and additions to the parking spaces and there is a major construction area going on. This is causing some major delays when getting the bus to the parking lots and it looks that not many buses are available when many people need them. Hopefully the situation is going to improve in the near future.
I spent altogether too much time here over the past two days in layover land, but it wasn't the worst airport experience ever... rocking chairs, plenty of 'nail clipper, magazines & earbuds' stores, a wine bistro with a live pianist, and of course, Carolina accents all-around yaaaaa'll.. . One major complaint - you need more outlet stations for plugging sh*t in, Charlotte! I shouldn't need to walk past 20 gates to find a station that is nearly full and unpleasantly crowded. You're a layover airport and you need more of these. Please.. . I did love the 'ritas and beans at Taquileria, and that did kill some time. Some deliciously tequila-ey time!. . Sidenote - totally leaned on my Kindle and smashed it here. :( Don't lean on your Kindle.
Easy to navigate. The best thing each time I connect in Charlotte is the Piano player between Concourse B and A. So nice to see live peaceful music in the hussle and bussle of the airport.
I love Charlotte and I don't even know her last name...The Airport much like the city itself is like the new girl in town who wants to be part of the "cool crowd" so she does her best to stand out....What's not to like about an airport with quick security..rocking chairs in the atrium..plenty of food options...bars..shopping..salons..and Starbucks every 10 feet?..special recognition for having a Bojangles Chicken Outlet which are seriously missed in Florida...add in the fact they have clean bathrooms with friendly Carolina Southern Bathroom Attendants..free Wi-Fi in the airport and plenty of charging stations and you have the template for what other airports should strive for....only reason I am not giving this airport 5 stars is not really their fault..since USAir has made it their primary East Coast Hub the airport is a little overutilized for it's size..it leads to all the problems one would imagine...gates that are occupied with another plane when you land so lots of time is spent sitting in the plane waiting to park..long waits to takeoff when you are number 10 in line to take off and crowded terminals and people movers..they are trying to deal with it with the current construction projects going on, but for now that just makes it a hassle getting to and from the airport...all in all though if I'm going to be delayed at an airport which always sucks CLT would be at the top of my list to be delayed at..just get a 3 piece at Bojangles than go hang at one of the bars drinking some of the local beer from Old Mecklenburg Brewery........cheers my fair Charlotte till I see you again
It's big and busy with a Starbucks on every concourse.  It's not too difficult to make it from one end of the building to the other, if you need to.. . My favorite spot is the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Co.  I like to bring the kiddos a candied apple when I return from a business trip.
Big airport with lots of moving sidewalks and the best part is rocking chairs! Lots and lots of beautiful white rocking chairs. There are small shops every few feet, plenty of places to eat and to shop. And these aren't touristy shops either, they have Brightons (jewelry and handbags) Brookstone (electronics), EA sports and PGA shop, also Johnstone and Murphy (men's wear) and my favorite!- Rocky Mountain chocolate factory! Unfortuantly I was just passing through on my way to Atlanta, so I only walked through this airport.
