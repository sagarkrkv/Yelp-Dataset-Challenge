I'll give it a 3.5/5 but the rating bar doesn't let me do half marks. . . Price: typical fancy Vegas buffet, so it rangesfrom $45-50 a person. We went during the Christmas/New Years season so we got 'holiday' pricing, which was $47 a person. . . Food: There's a variety, but I kept noticing that it centered a lot on Asian foods. And as a person who adores Asian food, and being in Vegas, you can definitely expect the Asian food to be only of mediocre status, so sadly I wasn't impressed. Especially since I've heard amazing reviews from before. . . There was Japanese (sushi rolls, sashimi & miso soup), Korean (pork belly meat, ddukboki, "kimchi" friend rice, & kalbi meat), Chinese (rice, udon, dumplings) Seafood (Snow & Alaskan crabs, muscles, shrimp, shrimp ceviche), Italian (risotto, meatballs, pizza,), Meats (prime rib, bone marrow, others...) Mexican (pork tacos) and a small selection for bread/cheese (four cheeses) and salad.. ^^Notice how the list gets smaller and smaller as it gears away from Asian food (although, this isn't the whole dinner list..just as much as I can remember). . . The sashimi I'm pretty sure exactly of the highest quality, since the tuna meat was light red. All the Korean food was just alright. There wasn't anything I would go back to get seconds for. However, the fried pork belly meat was redeeming. . . The seafood was great, specifically the shrimp ceviche!! They also have salmon of inconsistent quality. I got a plate and it was dry, but my friend got a plate and it was SO moist and delicious. I'd definitely recommend it if you can get a moist piece! . . The meat was very good - props on the prime rib and bone marrow. I'm glad that people other than Asian cultures are understanding that they're wasting animal parts by just eating the obvious meat-y parts on an animal. Italian nicely done, but the Mexican could've used more work. Salads were okay tasting and I'm not a cheese fanatic, but the brie didn't even taste good (and I love brie). . . I'm not a sweet fanatic, but the dessert section was quite phenomenal. I LOVED the ice cream section and the amazing chocolate dipped strawberries covered in either crushed oreos or toffee. The other small cake pieces were okay. A lot of it was of mushy texture and I'm not a fan, but other might be so definitely give it a try. It's definitely an impressive selection of desserts. However, don't bother with the macaroons. Not worth it. . . Service was great. They were on top of it like CHAMPS. Bravo, especially considering how ridiculously full it was!!
Came here for the brunch and was actually a little disappointed after reading all of these stellar reviews.  This is a $40/person buffet, throw me some decent seafood or cuts of meat in there!  Instead a lot of rice dishes, pastas, rib eye, etc.  Not that they weren't good, just not $40 good.  I was pretty surprised that we walked in without a wait at 1pm, but maybe that should've been my hint...
Located In The Cosmopolitan Of Las Vegas on The Famous Las Vegas Strip. This may be the best buffet in Las Vegas. They have done something quite clever here, the portions are pre plated in small sizes so you get to try everything without passing out. The choices here are interesting and you try them all without needing to be rolled out of the place. It is well worth the price. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
Visits: 1st. Rating: 4*. . One of the best buffets in Vegas. In our opinion, Bacchanal is better. Although some cousins like Wicked the best. It's a spar between these two heavy weights whenever you ask friends & family. So you can't go wrong with either.. . Lots of selections. Beautiful presentation. And the food tastes great. We don't do lunch at buffets, just dinner. Dinner always has a better selection at a slightly higher price of course, but it's worth it.
The 102$ fee for two people was a total waste. We stood in line for about half an hour only to get in another line to get served a small serving of sirloin that was cold!! All other food was gross. The Korean ribs were flavorless an cold. The steamed rice was burnt!!! How do you burn steam rice!!!! I love sweets and I didn't even like one of them and omg, they had a lot to choose from.  OMG !!! If i give one star is only because of the macaroni and cheese bar. Everything else was disgusting and cold. Do not waste your money here !!! I rather eat mc Donald's and I hate mc Donald's!!!! My boyfriend had to go throw up after eating here ! I'm glad there was a restroom right outside !
One of the best buffets I've been to. Reasonable price for what you get. There's a huge choice of hot and cold food and the desert is fantastic. Our drinks servers was great. For a couple of London lads we was surprised. However I do believe there should be a good separate que system for those staying at The Cosmopolitan.
Just okay. Arrived here for dinner the day after Christmas around 5:30pm. With a 2 hour wait, I had pretty high expectations and it was no where close to reaching it. I still prefer the Bachannal or Wynn's buffet even if there was no line. Maybe Wicked Spoon had a bad night when I arrived but I was disappointed. . . In terms of food, definitely felt more twilights than highlights. I only liked 3 items that I picked out.. . Twilights: There wasn't a lot of selection since I avoid and discriminate against a lot of asian food for the more expensive items. The prime rib was not good and I didn't even know about the other meat selection they had because the carver just kept throwing prime rib on people's plate. KBBQ short rib was difficult to chew, crab legs were skinny with little meat. Pizza was mediocre. Macarons texture was off. . . Highlights: Seared Salmon was good. Never had salmon at medium rare like that. Macaroni and cheese bar was nice when there was no line. Moose cake was surprisingly delicious. Our waitress was nice enough to bring out some very fresh Mint Tea with honey as I was eating dessert so that was nice. . . If you see a long line outside of the Wicked Spoon that's going to last at least 1 hour long, it's not exactly going to be worth your time unless this is your first buffet in Vegas. I felt there were more selections and better desserts at the Bachannal and Wynn.
Went during new years holiday. Crazy long lines price of lunch buffet 40.00 plus. Add unlimited mimosas before 2 for 10.00. Not bad.  The lunch menu is a pretty good selection and delicious. Omelets are still being prepared,  fresh smoothies in glass sealed jars, desert menu on point. my top lunch buffet.  Next time I'm trying dinner hopefully there is seafood
Very good value! I added $10 for the bottomless wine. The server was really nice, offering refills on the wine before I had even finished my glass and said I could take the rest to go. . . Of course with buffets there's always a lot of filler stuff. To get the best value for your dollar, I'd definitely focus on the crab legs (cold), shrimp cocktail, ceviche, prime rib, cooked shrimp and mussels, and Korean BBQ. They also had tasty garlic bread and some nice veggie dishes too if you get tired of meat and seafood. . . For dessert, make sure to try the gelato! I had the sugarfree chocolate and it was so good! You would never guess it was sugarfree. The salted peanut was also really good. Next time I'll save more room so that I can try even more flavors!
$25 brunch buffet with bottomless mimosa and a wide variety of food and dessert.. Best buffet I've ever been to. . The decoration is beautiful as well.. This place even satisfy my mom and sister, who are very picky when it comes to buffet.. Thank you Wicked Spoon for making my family happy !
It's like Top Chef decided to open a buffet of their creations and I was the judge of a long line of delicious dishes. I'd want to have a huge gathering here for my birthday before hitting the clubs on the strip. . .     Took the splurge and went to dinner here last Saturday and it was well worth the $47.  To me, the ambiance of this buffet sets it apart from others on the strip: modern decor, waiters and waitress uniforms aren't stuffy , the dark wood and dim lighting makes it feel like I'm in in a laid back bar like setting, the music/soundtrack in the background easily would've come from one of my own or my friends playists  with artists like Morrissey, The Cure and Camera Obscura (those are the ones that stuck out), and genres like soul, pop,  etc. I was intrigued by the factoids on the flat screen above the buffet and found it funny too. One slide said, "Butter On The Phone" and it explained that that's one of the pranks the chefs like to do to each other is put butter on the phone and tell someone else on the kitchen to pick up the phone. Who knew a buffet could have a sense of humor! . . .     And then there's the food: kale salad, asparagus salad with prosciutto are items I'd expect from some cool L.A. restaurant. The highlights for me were the prime rib, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and the shrimp with grits. Everything was amazing and I want to go back. I did consider Bacchnal and the Wynn's buffet, but the wait for both of those at 7 p.m. was an hour and forty-five minutes for the Wynn and hours for Bacchnal. The wait for Wicke Spoon was around 15 - 25 minutes.
3.5 stars. Weekday dinner for $38 is a pretty great deal for a fairly unique and diverse spread of selection, but the food was just okay.. . Hits:. - lamb: OMG amazing. Amazingly tender and flavorful.. - desserts: what a spread! It helps that everything is dark chocolate + raspberry which is the best combination known to mankind (or at least my taste buds). - antipasti: they had some nice little dishes like marinated beets and balsamic glazed watermelon, as well as a nice selection of cheese and charcuterie. . Misses:. - prime rib: it was really inconsistent to downright bad - pieces were mostly rubbery and flavorless. - bone marrow: props to them if just for having it because the pieces are really bony and flavorless . - Italian: I had some polenta thing with beef tongue (I think) and a risotto, and both were really bland. Good thing they're served as small plates so I didn't waste that much food.. . This is far from vegas's best buffet, but the ambience is fun, the small plates make it different, and the price is right. However, if you're gonna do a Vegas buffet, you might as well go all out and hit up one of their top rated joints (bellagio Caesars palace etc.) instead.
yum! an expensive buffet! probably in the top 10 "on the strip" buffets. . . ambiance: 4 - an organized setting for food and seating. there's quite a lot of space to walk around with a mess of plates and food. . . service: 4 - service was good until we reached almost the end of our dinner. the server stopped visiting our table, and I never received my tea. . . food: 4 - quality food; some cooked well, some not. many dishes are aesthetically designed on separate dishes, which can sometimes be difficult to balance on your plate while grabbing other foods. . . the dessert and salad sections were the most pleasing foods out of the whole selection, and they are prepared well. also, the gelato is great, but you can get it at any great buffet! . . because of WS's reputation, they should offer a really unique and tasty dessert that people will line up for!
Today is 1/5/14 we came for Sunday brunch and our tab was $39/pp + $20 for bottomless. A $110 dollars later this place isn't all that it's cut up to be. It's over rated!!!
Wicked spoon will always have a special place in my heart.. . The best thing about WS is definitely the bone marrowwwww! Sometimes, when we have a huge bone marrow craving, we would come to wicked spoon and stock up a plate full if bone marrow! Sounds gross but were obsessed with those gloppy goodness! Put some chimichurri sauce on it, and some red onion marmalade, a dash of salt, and you got yourself a bomb bone marrow!!. . Compared to Bacchanal buffet, they don't have as much selections on food. But, everything is quite delicious and has a good range as well. From seafood, to Italian, to Asian, everything is pretty good.. . A bonus to Wicked Spoon is that it's a lot less expensive than Bacchanal. A dinner here was $39 while Bacchanal racks up to $48.
I don't quite understand the hype.  It was a toss up to try this place versus bachanan.  I wish we tried the later. The food wasn't bad but for the price it was very mediocre.  The seasoning for the Korean short ribs were overly sweet.  We went early around 5:30 to 6:00 but when I was in line for the prime rib and asked for an end cut the server mentioned that it was not available.  I stated that I would wait for the next one and he mentioned that he didn't think there was another prime rib for that day????. Not bad but far from great.
We first visited here ayear ago and it was awesome. This time we came back as we had been thinking of how good the food was. However, to our disappointment, their food isn't as good as it was anymore. The food was lacking flavor, and the dessert is lacking profile as well. So sad.
The spread is impressive, and most of the dishes were executed well and solid, but it didn't quite have the wow factor. Nothing quite had the creative spazazz. They have a bunch of different salads, most of which are of the creamy dressing variety. The kale salad could have benefited from massaging the kale a bit more so that the kale is less fibrous. The cheeses were good. I also thought that the mussels and bone marrow was good. However, some of the bone marrow pieces were inedible. They were hard, just like bone. Perhaps they hadn't been cooked down enough? They have a large meat counter - prime rib, bone marrow, sausage, as well as an Asian inspired section. The desserts spread is also impressive. I really liked their pistachio gelato, but wasn't as impressed by the salty peanut one - that one tasted like peanut butter, which I love, but a little bit less in gelato form. . Over all, it's an experience, but maybe not mind-blowing?
I'm not usually a big fan of buffets but the Wicked Spoon is awesome! The food is sooooo good and it is culinary buffet at its best! So good, I ate the buffet for 2 brunches when I was in Vegas for the weekend $39.99 per person is well worth this buffet. You should go early because the lineup can get crazy long. Some of my favorites: angry mac & cheese, pumpkin pancakes, fresh juices and smoothies, kale salad, bulgogi beef, ribs. They also have a crazy dessert section with gelatos. Oh so delicious.
I was so underwhelmed by Wicked Spoon.. . We paid about $50 for a weekend buffet dinner. We were seated by the dessert section so we got to see the entire selection before getting seated, and it was kind of disappointing how little food there was! Call me a spoiled American, but I was expecting waaay more food.. . Nothing really stood out to me except for the prime rib and the octopus salad. I wanted to get a second helping of the octopus salad but they switched it out for something else :( Everything in the dessert section looked so good, but nothing wowed me! I did like the mango macaron and the carrot cake, but everything else was just okay. The gelato was super fluffy in a bad way (it reminded me of some Safeway ice cream), and I couldn't eat more than a couple spoonfuls. I had the Thai Tea and the mint chocolate chip and both tasted really artificial to me.. . Everything was okay - the meal was good, but I didn't feel like the $50 was justified. All the food was pretty good, but I've had better at other buffets. I'd rather shell out a little bit more for Bacchanal at Caesar's, because there's a lot more variety there.
I was debating eating here or at Bacchanal but Wicked Spoon won out because it was closer.. . I had the brunch buffet which came out to be about $28. It was a lot less crowded than the previous times I've come here for dinner, and as the hostess pointed out, you get the best of both menus.. . Here's a breakdown of what I ate (Yes, it's a lot but don't judge. It's Vegas. And I really only had a bite or two of the bad dishes):. . The Bad:. . Vegetarian udon: Gummy noodles. And apparently there are nuts in this dish? Didn't taste any.. . Vegetable gyoza: Suffered from the same issue as the udon. They're packaged in these tiny take-out boxes that end up steaming them and making them soggy.. . Angry mac n cheese: An American classic with a kick of heat. I think they need to lower the cheese ratio, or use a different cheese. There's was very liquidy, almost like queso.. . White bean cassoulet: Inedible. The andouille and beans were too salty.. . Sushi: Wish they used sushi rice.. . The Okay:. . Lamb rib: Not too gamey but a little greasy.. . Bone marrow: Hard to fuck this up.. . Curry pork rind: See above. It's a friggin pork rind with some shit dusted on it. I could eat a whole bag.. . Trout mousse cone: The sign had the most unfortunate typo: "trout mouse cone." But it was a nice little amuse bouche.  . . Balsamic watermelon: Another small but surprisingly tasty starter. . . The good:. . Thick cut bacon: No explanation necessary. Two types of horseradish = awesome.. . Fried Chicken: Love the presentation (little frying baskets). Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Good flavors.. . Braised beef cavateli: A little salty, but delicious. Would take this pasta dish over the macaroni any day.. . Mushroom polenta: Creamy and perfectly cooked.. . Desserts: All excellent. I had the molten chocolate cake, dulce de leche rice pudding and chocolate pistachio mousse (not mouse) cake. Aside from the molten chocolate cake, nothing was too sweet, which I like. Oh, and I liked the novelty of the raspberry rice cereal treat.. . At this point, I have to acknowledge my awesome server. I don't know his name, but he was the older Asian guy. I noticed the host was seating a lot of Asians in his area ... coincidence or profiling?. . Anyway, this dude was a fucking rock star. Brother would pull out my chair as I was walking back with my plate (okay, plates). He bussed efficiently and quietly. And, he even gave me a fresh to-go cup of coffee when I left.. . Food is still a little hit or miss, but I do like it here.
Is negative stars possible?. . We went for dinner on 12/26 with a party of 4, one was a toddler, one an infant.  Got in line 7:30pm, paid around 9pm, seated at 9:15pm.  Being that the place closes at 9pm, we asked the cashier specifically if food stocking of the buffet would stop. The cashier said exactly "as long as people are eating, food will continue to be stocked until 10:15 pm.". . Immediately after seating, at 9:15pm I go to get sushi and the cut rolls are all gone.  They are not brining or making anymore.  After eating a bit at 9:35pm I go to get crab legs and they are out and not brining any more out.. . So I decide to speak to the manager.  I have no problem with running out of food or not stocking a buffet after your normal closing time, but my issue was the information the cashier provided was inaccurate.  Had we been told running our might be a possibility, we may have gone elsewhere.  There was still quite a line behind us when we paid too.. . Even before I could get my entire comment out, the manager cut me off and said "Sir, everyone has had an hour to eat." I explained that was not my issue.  When I explained the sushi cut rolls were gone right when we were seated, he responded "Sir, we do not make any rolls in house, they are all brought in, when we run out, we run out."  Really?  The $20 buffet in my neighborhood makes their cut rolls in house and a $50 Vegas buffet does not?  The same explanation was given for the crab legs.  He reiterated that everyone had an hour to eat already.  I then showed my 9:15pm receipt and my seating was at 9:15pm.  My watch showed 9:38pm.  He responded, "that's still 45 minutes."  Really, in what Elementary math class does that equate to 45 minutes of eating time for me?. . Basically it was one excuse after another while cutting me off.  Finally, I explained that my issue is not with the lack of food, but with the information the cashier provided.  I guess the manager snapped.  He said "leave now and I'll refund you your money."  . . He didn't say IF you leave now, or give any kind of choice.  Essentially he kicked my family out and refunded our money.  I guess that's better than being kicked out period, but definitely not what I expect from a Vegas buffet with my toddler and infant with me.. . All I was expecting was an apology or "I'll go check with the food staff about the supply" and I would have been ok.  I would have been happy with an apology and a small 10%-15% discount.  In the end, no apology, just excuses and accusations.. . Service: 5/5 for the actual server.  Nice and friendly day after Christmas.  Was working past normal closing time.  Too bad we were kicked out before being able to tip him.. -100/5 for the manager.  Completely douche who can't manage the operations of a restaurant.  If you will run out of food, cut off the line and stop seating people.  You're in for a long night if you stay open with a half stock buffet.. . Food: 1/5 The food was bleah.  The salmon was cold.  None of the chefs making food seemed like they wanted to be there.  Maybe it was because it was the night after Christmas, maybe it was because of the time, but the food was generally tasteless.. . Ambience/location: 2.5/5 Average as far as Vegas buffets go.  It is kind of out of the way.  No matter, I won't be coming back here. . . Worst Vegas buffet experience ever.
While the food was decent, the price cannot be justified for how mediocre majority of the stuff offered on the buffet.  The sushi was americanized low grade garbage, the roasted meats were all cheap, and majority of the stuff looked better than it tasted.  There were a few things that tasted good like the slab bacon, watermelon salad, and the braised beef handmade pasta but for me to drop 40 bucks for a brunch buffet for bacon, watermelon and pasta is outrageous.  The bone marrow was also cooked incorrectly and needed to be roasted longer.  There was also no king crab or prime rib which is a must for a las vegas buffet.  I will never go back due to the price and I think i would rather pay a few bucks more and go to the bellagio buffet just for the king crab.  This is totally overrated.
I usually don't enjoy buffets that much, but oh my! This is the best buffet I've ever been to. I love how a lot of the food is portioned out into smaller containers, it makes it easier to try a lot more :)
After hearing all this hype on how amazing Wicked Spoon was, I was eager to try it out. And after trying it for myself, i think the consensus (not only mine, but the entire group I had gone with) was that wicked spoon was just A-OK. A buffet is a buffet and I maybe a had a one item that really stuck out. Everything else was pretty medicore and typical of a vegas buffet. . . Now the decor of the place is nice. You do absolutely get that fancy feel, like I am in a fancy place. Service is pretty good also (but is service really an area of focus when you're on at a buffet??).. . Price can get pretty heft during the holidays ($42.60 for LUNCH on holidays. not worth it) and for dinner (which is close to like $50 I think). . . ADVICE #1: IT IS NOT WORTH THE DINNER PRICE! (I capslocked so that it could catch your eye). Go for lunch/brunch for $27 bucks! They have breakfast items AND lunch items. They also have different stations, like a salad station, the breakfast station, the meats station, the asian section. . . ADVICE #2: If you want to save space in your stomach, skip the asian section. It's whatevers. . . My favorite item has got to be the short rib cavatelli. Holy crap it was good! The meats were also pretty delicious. . . Another plus, they have a gelato station in the desserts station which is pretty cool.
I don't know why, I feel here is better than bellagio, maybe I'm hungry today, lol. I like the environment, very comfortable. Excellent service. I'll come again!
We would not even considered buffet at this place if it weren't a 2 for 1 coupon we received on the flight from SFO to Vegas. The yelp reviews were generally excellent, so we opted for this one over the buffet at Ballagio or Wynn. . . The quality of cooking was beyond our expectation. The selection is comparable to other hotel buffet outside of Vegas, and definitely not as extravagant as other High end Vegas buffets. The value without the discount was great, and the value with coupon was irresistible.  . . Dishes worth mentioning:. Bone marrow, gelato, creamy corn, oyster Rockefeller, chocolate dipped strawberry.
tapas style, creative food, great dessert.
The service was outstanding here. Our server was very nice. She was very tentative and refilled our drinks as soon as we were done. . . The food is good. Nothing too crazy, but nothing too plain as well. I think it's an experience and you have to go here if you haven't. Most of their food was interesting to try. Nothing I was crazy about. Although I did kill about 10 plates of king crab legs. . . My boyfriend was crazy about the bone marrow. He's the only guy I know that would pay 40 bucks to go into a buffet to eat cheese and crackers ). . . Desert was okay too. The galto and sorbe were my favorites.
Friendly staff. Food wasn't the best quality.  For the price, expected higher quality and fresh food.
Since Yelp orders things by original date, and there are 2982 reviews when I write this, I'm thinking my review will be read in say, March of 2017.  . . That said, I've made a point to try most of the Strip buffets, the other reviewers aren't lying it's pretty tasty here overall.. . They've got the small pots/baskets for a lot of the dishes like some of the other buffets do, and though they are cute, you end up with one on your plate, and no room for any of the other tasty treats.   . . All the usual seafood choices (crab legs, etc...). . The bone marrow is good, but wow it's filling and greasy.  Do not have it first!  . . Dessert choice is great, a lot of choices (macarons even!) to be had.. . Service is normal for buffets, the servers are attentive and friendly, clearing your multiple plates away without you noticing.. . Out of the way to get to in the hotel though, which is both a good and bad thing.  Good in that it reduces lines.  Bad in that you have a long hike to get there, and honestly, it feels like you're walking through dead parts of a convention hotel where you probably shouldn't even be.  But viola, there you suddenly are, and it's food coma time.
Amazing! Desserts were the best! The last time I went it was $29 per person for dinner. The line was not bad, just waited for 15-20 mins.
BEST BRUNCH EVER.. . That's the only time I'd want to stuff my tummy from here. Where do I even begin.. The first time I came to Wicked Spoon was during dinner and I didn't enjoy it as much as I love their brunch. Im from California and this is the only buffet I've been to on the Strip and I don't think I I'd want to bother with any other. It's pretty much love at first bite, that's how I describe my feelings towards the food they serve here for breakfast.. I've only been here twice but I already know its going to be a routine visit every time Im here in Vegas.. . . WHAT I ALWAYS DAY DREAM ABOUT after leaving here:. Pumpkin Spice Pancakes (NOM NOM NOM NOM) not sure if its seasonal. . Wicked Juice (their own blend of fruit juice) BOMB. . Steak (not sure what kind it was but I thought I'd be adventurous and asked forit grilled after they cut me a slice) one of the best steaks I've had.. . Caesar Salad was delicious  but it was drowning with too much dressing :(. & also the Greek salad was good as well.. . Baked Egg Whites w/ Veggies was very light and tasty, it went hand and hand with my flavorful steak.. . Fruit / Yogurt Parfait, shot glass serving but that's all you really need since there's so much other food to choose from, it was quite sour but the fruit and granola balanced the taste out, not what I expected but in a good way :). . Omelettes ! Made to order your way, isn't that awesome? I didn't have any but I thought the idea of creating your own omelette subway style was cooI.. . I can't remember much else of what I've eaten here but it's definitely worth the money! The service here is awesome as well.
We just ate our Sunday brunch at Wicked Spoon and loved it! All of their dishes have a unique spin to them which makes this buffet stand out. They have a wide variety of dishes; sushi, Asian cuisine, meats, bone marrow, side dishes, breakfast specials, salad bar, meat/cheese bar, and a dessert bar. I enjoyed everything I had. The only thing I was disappointed about was they did not have crab legs in their breakfast set up. However, they did have them for dinner. The service was impeccable. The server was on top of taking our dishes, filling up our drinks in a timely manner. I would definitely come back!
Went for a quick breakfast/lunch at Wicked Spoon when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Vegas. The buffet location was very convenient for me since it was just afew floors down from my room. Although I would not consider this place as one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. In comparison to other buffets in Vegas the variety of food was limited. However there would be no complains from me in regards to the taste of the food.
Not worth it at all!. . Unless you have a half-off coupon, Wicked Spoon was barely par with the $20 buffets at the cheap hotels. Sure they have some fancy "looking" items, but they all fell flat. And at the premium price point, you'd expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. . . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA. . It was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I've been to.
First off, I agree with most of the reviewers; I was expecting more food. Second, I thought I was ready with my expectations of WS after reading the reviews but was proven wrong. Went in for brunch and here's the summary:. . Best tasting: . Watermelon salad; HANDS DOWN the best tasting dish; basically a tiny piece of watermelon and some kind of cream cheese topping. Soooo yum I ate 4 plates which translates into 4 tiny pieces of watermelon so don't judge me! . . Fruit smoothie; (mocktailish) and was pretty refreshing. Just wished it was chilled. . . Custom made omelette; Didn't get it but friend loved it.. . OK to good:. Mushroom truffle risotto; Creamy and just the right amount.. . French toast; Just like your regular french toast.. . Panna cotta; Creamy and light at the same time. . . Blaaahhh:. Wicked friedchicken; BORING!. . Garlic bread; UGHHHH! . . Sushi; Ewwwieeewwww!. . Mussles; Gamey!. . Now lets talk DESSERT which I had read repeatedly about and was most excited for. Soooo disappointed. Nothing special about the cakes and baked goods. Didn't try all but my fave was a white chocolate orange dome mousse thingie which was pretty good. The strawberries I had heard so much about were wack! Yes wack! Go get em from Godiva! . . Pretty meh meal...
Way way overpriced & overrated. Came here for dinner during the Holiday week with 7 other family members at $50 each. Waited in line for 1.5 hours. Honestly, we were all hungry we could eat a cow and didn't have much expectation for the food quality coming in. Turns out both food and service were such disappointment I would never ever ever return. The meat line was so long most of us didn't bother waiting as we feel for the people still standing in line to get in. We ate fast and got out of here as fast as possible. Food just didn't taste right... the only dessert I enjoy were the chocolate dipped strawberries. Overall - total waste of money and wish I was knew earlier. It could just be the busy Holiday week but I am not willing to risk it ever again.
I had spent all week trying to decide between wicked spoon and bacchanal. I had been to bacchanal before and so this time I thought I would try something new even though I knew bacchanal was a sure thing. Plus it was closer to our hotel so laziness won. . . Got there and paid for brunch price before 3pm (around $35 on a saturday) but soon after they changed to the dinner menu so lucky for us. For brunch they do not have seafood like crab and such so thats dissapointing because bacchanal had it all day. Crab is always delicious so cant complain about that. . . Overall, nothing really special that stands out. The bone marrow was the one unique thing I had not seen before but it was super greasy and not as flavorful and I was hoping. Had to add some of the salt they give you. Top sirloin was pretty good though. Everything else is pretty generic and there was not as much variety as bacchanal. The asian section was sad and I was kinda hoping for some soups. . . Next time I'll just pay a little more and tell my feet to suck it up and walk to bacchanal which is a sure thing.
The Wicked Spoon is the best buffet I have ever had. The amount of food on this buffet is nothing short of amazing. They have everything from a carving station to fresh Sushi. I really enjoyed the Ebi Shrimp and the Cheese and meats selection. Everything on the buffet was fresh and they kept it clean. The service here was also very good about drink refills and taking away dirty plates. My one complaint was they jacked up the prices during the Christmas holiday. We went right when they opened and it was a Brunch for $39... och. Kind of pricy for breakfast. Over all the food here is very good though.
We had never actually been to Wicked Spoon: The Buffet.  When Cosmo first opened they offered several ongoing events to showcase the culinary and liquid refreshment talents of some of their offerings.  The (now defunct) wine store had a bi-weekly wine and food pairing seminar, complete with generous tastings of both.  Wicked Spoon set up elaborate themed buffets in one of their private rooms, with spectacular tastings and open bar, and we went to it regularly until, like all good thing, it ended.  Oh, how I miss those glory days!!. . But on the LAX to LAS leg of our recent trip back from Australia we were each handed a playing card-type box containing Cosmopolitan promo cards, and one was a BOGO for Wicked Spoon.  We took advantage of that one, expecting that the food would be as good as we had remembered.  And we sure weren't disappointed.. . While all the hype and kudos seems to go to Bacchanal these days, we have to say that we enjoyed Wicked Spoon more.  (Herb, strangely, doesn't like Bacchanal at all).  It's not as industrial high-tech looking as the other place, but it's decorated somewhat like the one at Red Rock, and it's comfortable.  It doesn't require walking through a maze or standing on long lines.  Our waiter, Stephen, was most congenial, friendly, and professional, and we enjoyed talking with him.. . We loved a lot of the offerings.  I had the best octopus salad ever, and that goes for the individual Shepherd's Pie, with excellent quality beef and carrots that weren't mush.   Risotto with truffle oil, salmon with butternut squash, short rib pizza with blue cheese, and lamb panini were some of the other terrific offerings.  When I tried the leg of lamb - rare - it looked dried out but was anything but.  I put chimichurri sauce over it, and it was delicious.  Best of all, IMHO, none of the food was oversalted, deriving its good flavors from proper seasoning.  Desserts were wonderful, and I disagree with the reviewer who panned the gelato; my tiramisu and almond tastings were rich, creamy, and sinfully good.  And I have to admit to tasting some of the other desserts, too.  That huge strawberry dipped in Heath Bar Chocolate was irresistible!. . Herb just told me that today's LVRJ has an article about those Cosmo promos, but you have to fly from LAX to get it.  Too bad, our upcoming trip to LA will be that long, boring drive.  Maybe one of us should fly!. . Without the promo, it would have cost us about $82 before tax, tip,  and alcohol.  With it, it was a great deal for an awesome buffet.
I have read a lot of reviews and realize imost of it is all relative to the person who writes it. When I write a review about food places, I try out most of what they have before I give my opinion. Well it is rare I would give one star for most food places because typically I research first but boy was I wrong about this place. I have no idea how this place can be high rated 4 stars! I guess those who gave it the 4 stars or higher must've been smokin or just haven't had better. Where do I start, I went left to right and tried most all they had and really I had a hard time to eat and I was starving. I can't remember the last time when I was starving and lost my appetite as soon as I ate. . .              Don't bother going for the crabs, they don't have King crabs while Bellagio and  Wynn does. Wicked spoon, absolutely the worst opeiia crabs I have ever tasted. It was literally the flavor of bad sink water. It was soaked for so long the crab flavor was absent, it tasted so bad I lost my appetite immediately. I mentioned it to both the waitress and manager. The waitress said all the seafood comes frozen, I'm thinking are you serious? like I have never eaten pre frozen seafood at a restaurant before. I'm a sport fisherman for crying out loud, like anyone would think live seafood is delivered to a buffet. The waitress told me to  just ask the cook to boil it and use butter. Really? that will make a sink watered down crab taste better!  The manager came to me and I told him the same situation, the manager just said thanks for letting him know and he just turned away while he said thanks. WTF! They do not care about their place obviously. I should've known something was wrong when there was absolutely no lines, in fact there was only a couple in front of us. Even after we left, there was no line either. It is pretty obvioius, I would never come back to eat even if it was free. I come to Vegas to eat well, not have bad food go in me. . .            The prime rib? you call that prime rib? taste like gamey rump roast. The short ribs had OK flavor but was chewy and I had to spit out the grizzle parts.All the food in the little handle pots, they were mostly sitting for so long, they were dry. Why not just put each item into a large pan so we can take what we can eat. It would prevent the food from drying up so fast. Now that's a tip they should really consider.  I threw away most everything I grabbed as it either tasted bad or was dried up. Shrimp, I did not bother, the color alone told a story. They try to make the food look gourmet but really a novice attempt to make it appear appetizing, it failed to do so. Sushi? don't bother, that stuff they got rolled up, it is a mystery what it is. Chinese food in food to go small boxes, really? what is this place? I went left to right but could not find an item to hit the spot. They serve bone marrow! I felt like a dog when the chef poured all the bones in front of you, COME AND GET IT! I tried one, yuk! who wants jellied muck! I know what bone marrow is and this one isn't done right at all. I know these so called chefs aren't taking their cooking seriously. It's like a home town buffet type chef but truly in my opinion, worse. . .            The bottom line, the main hard meals are below standard, they should not have food in those small handled pots, not have take out boxes for Chinese food, they should not overflow their food so it gets dry or hard. The dessert section was OK. All in all, I would not eat there even if it was for free and I mean that. Bacchanal and Bellagio are much better for overall. When you decide to eat at a buffet, always seek the best of the menu you like to eat, otherwise you'd be disappointed My rating is truly what I had experienced from A to Z. I don't just nick pick over one dish. I tried most of them as much as I can force myself to taste but that's what I mostly did, I did wasted a lot of food because I could not enjoy it. The dessert and drink was most I have downed there. Selection was poor as well, a lot of basic foods really and the ones they try to culinate was just murder! you'll be spitting out food or just not finishing it and waste a lot of it.  Don't waste your time and money here when there are many others that are way much better. Honestly, I haven't had food this bad in years. I'm not even a picky eater either.
Was in Vegas last July 13th 2013 went to try out what so many people have been raving about this place. I tried it and paid for 4 other people here at $40 plus a piece. For the Money not worth it. I found the Buffet at Mandalay Bay was a lot better even though a smaller selection  Mandalay even provides free beer and wine. Food made me sick and I would probably never go back there again to try it. Liked the dessert selection but overall experience was bad. Service was good but that's normal everywhere in Vegas. I have to Agree with the post made by Eli G the food look fancy but it did fall flat. I may not be the best food critic but I can tell the difference between good food and not so good food.
Has to be one of the best buffets I've ever been to. Fast service and high quality food. The dessert buffet is the best part!
I think Wicked Spoon is one of the better buffets in Las Vegas.  It's clean and open and offers an impressive variety of items.  I never eat enough to fully appreciate buffets but I do enjoy having a nice selection to choose from.  Try to go at off peak times and avoid holidays as the line is way too long and not worth a long wait.
It was ok. Not a huge selection.  Caesars palace has the best buffet in Vegas.
This is seriously the most amazing buffet I have EVER been to in my life. Seriously! . . I have never seen so much food, it was amazing, and for the most part everything was delicious.. . Cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to go here again.
The buffet cost $86 for two people.  A little steep but hey it's Vegas.. . Service:. Bill was a very nice server and was good about refilling our drinks and checking up on us.. . Food:. . Salad Bar:. Shrimp cocktails. Hummus. Olives. Fruit. Caesar Salad. Italian Salad. . Seafood Bar: (Didn't even look since I don't eat seafood)(Was the most crowded area though). . General Food Bar:. Deep Fried Chicken. Mash Potatoes. Fancy Pizza. Garlic Bread. Green Beans. Broccoli. Potatoes. Prime Rib. Chicken. Sausage. Sushi. Fried Rice. Chow Mein. Miso Soup. and a couple others. . Most of the food is pre- portioned so you can sample everything which is nice so your eyes don't get bigger than your stomach.. . It may look like there are a lot of stations but in reality the food is just all spread out with gaps in between, and the majority of it is seafood (which I cannot eat since I'm allergic).  . . They have a Mac and Cheese bar that is apparently made to order but when we went there was no staff there to help so we didn't get to try it.. . The dessert bar is the real treat here.  The Cosmopolitan does dessert right.  They have a gelato bar with a bunch of different flavors.  I recommend the strawberry balsamic and the nutella. I wish you could go there and just pay for the dessert bar.. . In general the dessert bar is really the only thing worth your time.  The other food is just food that will sustain your appetite and really isn't anything special.  I don't think it was worth $100 for two people.  I prefer the excalibur buffet which has the same stuff and more kid friendly food for half the price.
Every time we come to Vegas we are told by everyone to go to Wicked Spoon. But always skipped it because I just couldn't see coughing up almost $90 for two people for dinner. But after using our Aria room credit and starving for something good to eat for dinner we walked next door to finally try this buffet. You have to walk some through Cosmopolitan to find it. Its around this empty hallway full of art and classic posters. . . I have got to point out that EVERYONE working here is beyond friendly, helpful, and actually talkative. I waited for the mac and cheese bar and the guy making all the orders struck up conversations, made jokes, and was really efficient. Our server was also super nice and vigilant on refills and empty plates. And the gelato guy was really funny and quick. . . They had a range of food from Japanese to Israeli to Spanish and even comfort food. I especially liked the ceviche, shepherd's pie, mac and cheese and oh god the desserts. But I skipped over or barely ate a lot of what I picked up. The prime rib had a lot of fat, the bool kogi was dry, and the sushi was average. But back to the desserts. I would say they had the best tasting desserts I've had at a buffet. Come on nutella gelato!!! your killing me! Macaroons, mini cakes, and cupcakes, oh my! I was in sugar heaven.. . The place is nicely decorated. There wasn't that many people eating there. In fact there was no line at 7:30pm on a Saturday.
AWESOME BUFFET!. . Yes it's about $40 per person for dinner but it's worth it. They have a giant selection of high quality assorted foods from all over the world. Not like your average buffet quality.. . Asian meatballs, rich eggs Benedict, thick cut bacon, Korean style BBQ ribs, bone marrow, charcuterie section, sushi, fried chicken, spicy Mac and cheese, gelato bar, ALL DELICIOUS! Their desserts are top notch as well. . . So many options, you'll be full before you can try half of everything. That's the only disappointment I had.
Came here on a Friday evening for dinner around 8:30. There wasn't a line so we were seated right away. I was a little surprised at the price $50/person. That's pricer than the buffet at Bellagio and Caesars for sure.. . Anyways, our server was terrible. He want attentive at all and we hardly saw him the whole time we were there even thothe restaurant was nearly empty. The cups, silverware and plates we had on the table were dirty so we had to have them exchanged. My cup had a huge smear and a lipstick stain. Gross.. . The redeeming (and most important) part though was that the food was pretty delicious. I really liked the polenta, it was one of my faves. The Korean short ribs were also super delish. I didn't get to try the prime rib because the guy who was in charge of that station was tweeting out or something when he was carving and was MIA most of the night. Wackkkk.. . Another reason why I couldn't give this place a higher star rating is that they were running out of food and didn't even try to replenish the supply. I understand we came at 8:30, but I mean...we paid $50 a head, we should at least be able to eat what we want while we're there. For example, they were out of bone marrow, the pizza they had was rock hard, they were our of 1/3 of their desserts including the chocolate covered strawberries (not like those are hard to make) and their pork belly was sad lookin/tough tasting.. . All that being said, the foods that we were able to get our hands on were pretty tasty. I think I'd come back the next time. I'm in Vegas, maybe during more peak times. Hopefully the food will be fresher, the plates cleaner and the service friendlier. Til next time, Wicked Spoon!
I'm not a buffet fan but this one got my vote! Good quality food, beautiful restaurant with knowledgeable friendly staff!
The Wicked Spoon buffet is the best buffet I've ever ate at Las Vegas.. Customer service is more than what you could ask for.. Ms.Lisa was our server and was outstanding.. With many food varieties, it is hard to choose what to eat.. They have a little but of everything from Asian cuisine to fresh seafood. The dessert was heaven in my mouth.. Bottom line is the Wicked Spoon buffet is the best Vegas has to offer.
I came to the Wicked Spoon with some friends after hearing nothing but amazing things about it. I can't say I was disappointed by it - the food was great - but there were a number of standout problems with it that keep me from giving it a higher rating.. . Let's start with the good:. The food is great. Meat en masse, all of it average or above-average; good selection of food; quite good dessert. There was a small selection of salads, but nobody really ventured that way (nor should they, really).. . Particular standouts for me were the Shepherd's Pie, the Kalbi, and the Italian sausage.. . Now for the bad:. Two things really stood out as problematic to me. First, cleanliness. A lot of the plates we grabbed at the buffet line were dirty, one with a large chunk of chicken stuck to it. It felt like they overloaded an industrial dishwasher and neglected to rinse or check for cleanliness before shoving the plates back out. To add to that, pretty much all the cups at our table were dirty.. . Second, and this probably being tied to the first, it felt like the servers just didn't give a damn. The servers came around pretty infrequently (I think we saw them maybe three times over the course of 90 minutes? The place wasn't busy, either; we saw maybe ten, fifteen other tables total) and there was just a general air of indifference that was rather offputting.. . If the dining experience were rated on food alone, this would be a solid 4 or 5 stars...but I can't justify that for a place that's giving me extra food with my clean plates.
The most flavorful buffet I've ever been too. Went for brunch, so good. The place is elegant and the food amazing. Favs were the angry mac n cheese, parfaits, passionfruit juice, smoked salmon, chocolate dipped strawberries and white chocolate mousse cake. I just wish my stomach had room for more. My only complaint is that the server was too busy so I couldn't get more drinks but still an amazing place.
I can say this is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. Great variety of dishes from around the world. I appreciated that they served out the portions so that it was just enough for a taste and to help with wastage. Lots of fresh food, but some did end up sitting there for a bit like the dbuokki (sp?). . . The best part was the gelato station! . . $36 for lunch on a weekend.
Little pricey for dinner but that's Vegas. Stayed for dinner, which had a decent variety of food.  Their mushroom truffle risotto was delicious. They also had bone marrow and made to order mac & cheese. 3 choices of cheese + sauce, meat (steak, sausage etc) and veggies (spinach, jalapeno and more). My brother got his to order with everything in it and it was awesome. Their decorum tries to mask the fact that it's a buffet. That doesn't mean that it's not beautiful. Look for the giant shoe on your way to the buffet, you can't miss it!
Not as good as the hype goes. With 60$, I can get a pretty nice dinner at other places and still be full.
I don't do buffets. I think they're never worth the price...but Wicked Spoon opened my eyes to a whole new buffet world! . . I absolutely loved everything I ate. They display all their food beautifully. We came here on a Friday afternoon, didn't do the bottomless mimosas. It was like $27 with all the taxed and shit. . . Good stuff!  Heathy juices, bone marrow, fried chicken...YUM! They offer various cuisines, which is tasty. I really could get on the buffet band wagon if more of them were like this.
Two important contexts of this review.  First, this review is for the breakfast/brunch.  I haven't tried the buffet for dinner.. Second, the comparison is from the perspective that this is a buffet.  I'm not going to compare a buffet to Jose Andres's place at Cosmo.. . This is the best breakfast buffet that I've been to in Vegas.  It may not have some features that certain people adore (like giant mounds of crab legs), but what they have is often unique and well done.  Love the sticky-buns!  Loved the homemade slab of bacon.  We got a end piece that was overly salty, and when combined with a middle slice was perfect.. . This is only buffet in Vegas we make plans to attend, and that I look forward to.. . We also enjoyed the best service we've had at a buffet.  Our server quickly learned all our names, served us promptly, and knew the buffet in great detail and made numerous recommendations.. . 5 stars -- as good as it gets (for a buffet in Vegas).
My favorite buffet on the strip. Haven't tried them all but Wicked Spoon is Wicked awesome. My favorite part is that it's a dessert haven. My eyes bulged out of the sockets upon seeing the gelato station. . . Really like how the food is served in the little cups. Feels more sanitary and presentation is eye catching as a result. All the food is cooked well and the taste is never absent. Can only imagine how many chefs are in the back preparing this stuff. If only they offered a 24 hr pass here.. . Keep doing what you do Wicked Spoon & I keep coming back
When I came in to Wicked Spoon, I came with a set of high expectations and I have to say that Wicked Spoon didn't disappoint me.. . I would prefer this place than Bacchanal at Caesars Palace. It costs $35 vs $51 at Bacchanal per person.. . Anyhow, when I came in here it is almost like a dessert galore. They have a huge spread of dessers in the center. Also, the foods are prepared well, beautiful presentations and taste great.. . We have found our favorite buffet place in Vegas.
I came to dine for the third time and still impressed by them. I have tried Bacchanal@Caesar Palace, but yet both places have their spotlights. presentation is always the best at Wicked. Portion sizes are amazing, which most of them are only bite sizes. That'll give you more room to try on something else. Prime rib and bone marrow are must-try items. their made-to-order Mac-N-Cheese has better variety now with more sauce options. Please leave rooms for deserts. sorbet and gelatos are to die for.
Hubby and I arrived just as they started the dinner service, 3pm, so we paid the $41 dinner rate. I expected dinner entrees. I have no idea where the up-charge from brunch to dinner is coming from.  . The dining area was not full and, sadly, some of the chafing areas were empty so I I wondered what I missed and why there weren't  anymore hot dishes being replaced. They had the usual buffet fare: crab legs (no knuckles), prime rib (really quite bloody with no medium cooked area), salad etc. . There was a pile of 5-spice pork belly. It was supposed to be served with Hoisin sauce, but the it was empty and remained empty. The pork belly was slightly undercooked, difficult to cut with the butter knife provided. The skin, which for me is the best part of the cut, was undercooked and chewy. Yuck! Such a disappointment! The Korean cut ribs was so overcooked that it was inedible! Rubbery, undercooked meat next to overcooked, jerky meat.. The Hof Brau section was no better. Hubby and I had a slice of the prime rib and it was so bloody! Thank goodness the server cut the slices paper thin so it could continue to cook on my hot plate. It didn't help. It was impossible sawing through the flesh with our butter knives and ended up looking like shredded meat than a steak. On the plus side, they are not messing around with their horseradish! My eyes were watering and I couldn't breath through my nose it was so hot! Hubby got a slice of pork and when he brought it back to the table, realized it was all fat. Big fail there!. There were single serving metal pots of mushroom risotto. They looked dry on top but once you stirred the grated parmesan into the rice it was quite surprising! The rice was tender without being mushy and it was still creamy without being too starchy.. Hubby brought back a bowl of creamy soup, where the hell was that? He gets gout very easily so I was surprised to hear it was lobster bisque. He pushed it towards me to take a taste, suspiciously like a dare.  It took a spoonful and was again very surprised! Velvety, flavorful with chunks of tender lobster, not the fibrous stringiness that happens to shellfish that has been sitting in heat for too long.. Time for dessert! We were seated near that island and I had been watching the few remaining diners pass by with their beautifully presented single servings.  I ordered coffee and grabbed a plate. They were all so colorful that I wanted to try a sample of everything, but I reigned it in and picked ones I haven't seen in other buffets. The problem with pastries is that, once sliced, it gets stale very quickly, especially small portions. They were beautiful but stale. No bueno! The coffee was a welcome relief from the disappointing end to an expensive meal!. On the plus side, our server was very attentive. She cleared  out our dishes efficiently and refilled our beverages without interrupting our meal.  Other wait staff came by and as well to keep our table clutter free. As soon as diners around us left, their tables were quickly and quietly turned over to receive the next diners. It's a welcome to not be ducking and weaving to avoid the shrapnel of broken dishes or flying food from waitstaff haphazardly flinging dirty dishes and silverware into disgusting tubs. Hence the 3 stars. After reading all the wonderful reviews I am saddened to say I did not get the same experience. Let this be a warning to all diners: Do not come here at the end of brunch/beginning of dinner service. The offerings IMHO did not justify the higher charge from brunch to dinner and, sadly, although the dishes looked good, they just didn't do it for me. I will not be returning.
I seriously refuse to have an entire Vegas trip without going here! My favorite Vegas buffet!!. . The times that I've gone here, I've gone for brunch, which was probably a really good idea. One, because, bottomless mimosas?! Haiiiilll yessss! And two, it's probably not fun getting ready to go clubbing feeling all full after a buffet. . . Anyways, the food has so many options. They totally do that continental thing where there are different sections serving various dishes from different parts of the world. On top of that, amazing presentation! I remember getting chicken fingers once that were served in mini frying racks!! Soooo cute! They also had something called wicked juice, which were fruit smoothies and were really good. The dessert bar was amazing. They had had dessert for days and so many options for gelatos.. . The service was good too. Our waitress knew to keep those mimosa refills coming! We went around 1030, and left around 1230 or 1 to make sure we really got our drink on.. . Also, it's located in cosmopolitan! A really nice hotel with awesome art pieces on the way! Make sure to take a pic in front of the oversized heels! Lol.. . Definitely go here. It won't be a complete trip to Vegas without it!
This buffet was just OK.  I will give them 3.5 for presentation though.  The food was lacking flavor.
The best buffet in las vegas..the food is amazing..they have best variety of food..a most stop
Whyyyyy was I so hungover when I came here?!?! Such a waste. But it was so good..... . I liked all the random things that came in the mini metal pots. Can't remember what they were now but I know they all had such unique flavor. I wish they had more shellfish to choose from but the mussels were pretty good.. . My #1 recommended thing to eat here... ICE CREAM. I got the mint and the mango and oh my goddddd I wanted to eat 10 scoops.
For the price of this buffet you'd think that it would have tons of food to choose from but no it was just average. I went on a Saturday for brunch and I maybe ate about four items. The best thing about the brunch was the Gelato! I got the fried chicken and something that it was seasoned with did not agree too well with my stomach! This buffet might be good to others but it just wasn't good to me! I would have given it one star but the service was good and so was the Gelato.
It's Sunday morning, you're hung over, and you need something greasy and/or delicious to help start your day. Well, if you can stomach a short wait (or sometimes no wait at all), it's definitely worth coming to Wicked Spoon. Buffets in Vegas wax and wain and Wicked Spoon is definitely waxing.. . 2 stars for the food, oh man, it's just so delicious, even by not buffet standards of food this place is delicious. It's one of those places where you run around like a chicken with it's head chopped off wanting to just put everything in your mouth like a squirrel with a plethora of nuts.. 1 star, for more food! jesus, it's not just how good the food is, but also the variety. A lot of times a buffet type place will have strengths in a particular type of cuisine, but not this place, everything is good. 1 star for the atmosphere, large dining room, plenty of seating, well lit, good layout. 1 star for the service, they were friendly, quick, efficient, all in all great. . Definitely come here and stuff your face, it's one of the better buffets on the strip.
This is one of the best buffets in Vegas.. I've been to a lot and this place is actually worth the price! Everything from the presentation to food quality is pure perfection. Love it!!!
I came here at the last day of 2013. Ar first, my friends and I wanna go to Caesar but they charged a lot and had a limited two hours dining time. We felt not very happy and the see the review of wicked spoon and quickly decided to give it a try. We are so satisfied with every meal they offer, I love the truffle risotto so much and had it twice! The desserts are awesome! This is my first time spotting the strawberries with chocolate in buffet. The service was also good, waiters are all polite and kind to answer our questions. I will come next time if I go to vegas!
