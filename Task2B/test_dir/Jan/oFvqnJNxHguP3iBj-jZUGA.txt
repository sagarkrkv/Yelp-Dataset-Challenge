Outstanding, I really I enjoyed it!  It was totally amazing how they use the water cannons and dancing waters!
Best view: Patio of Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel in the evening.  Enjoy a Steak Frites while you're there!
I always LOVE watching the fountains at Bellagio. it's an iconic sight and no trip to Vegas is complete without watching this show! The best thing is that it is FREE!!! But seriously, the show always amazes me no matter how many times I watch it! I love the music they play and how the water dances to it. You can see if from across the street, but I think it's best to stand on the same side of the street as the fountains to be able to fully hear the music. My favorite song to listen to for the water dance is "Time to Say Goodbye". . . I believe the show is every 15 minutes starting at like 4 or 5 pm. . It's for sure a MUST-SEE!! How can anyone give this less than 5 stars!. . You can also view the show from behind at the lounge/club Hyde inside Bellagio. I've seen it from in there too... and although you'll be bumping to club music inside of thee actual music that the fountains are dancing to, it is still quite a sight because from this side of the water dance, you can see Paris in the back and it looks pretty cool. Also, watching water dance and having some drinks is never a bad thing! LOL
This is one of my favorite "shows" on the Strip.  During the day it's boring.  But at night when they light it up it's really beautiful.  No naked girls or anything like that.  Just "dancing" waters moving with the music.  And it's free to anyone who just walks by.
Always have to watch the fountains at least once while you are in Vegas.
I only knew of these fountains really because of Ocean's 11. I'm so glad that I came out to see these fountains because the show is beautiful! I actually got goose bumps watching it - it's just amazing. I highly recommend that you come here at least once - it's free, it's beautiful, and it won't take up much of your day.
You can't say you've been to Vegas until you spend time watching the Fountains of Ballagio.. . In the sea of humanity, it is easy to get lost in the music and the soothing nature of water.  Treat yourself to a good vantage point to take it all in, several times during your visit.. . Who would have thought that one of the best shows in Vegas would be fee???
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100. . Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." . . As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.
Yes I was here, the fountains are very pretty from the street (they are better from the Eiffel tower Paris across the street) I do love the fountains a must see when in Vegas..
The water show, especially at night, is absolutely beautiful.  the way the water moves with the music and light is magical. love it!  i've seen the fountain from the strip andup high (from the view of my hotel room). nothing beats standing on the strip taking in the sights and sounds of vegas and the fountains.
---------------------------  600th Reviews  --------------------------- . . \(^o^)/ "Best Free Show In Vegas Hands Down" \(^o^)/. . Bellagio Fountain Show is easily the best free attraction in Las Vegas Strip.  The fountain is a whopping 8-acres manmade lake.  It cost as much as 40 million to build; the fountain created by WET.  I think the fountain has something to do with the cost of the Bellagio high room rate.  The fountain had help Bellagio putting itself above most other 5 stars hotel in the strip.  Vehicles and pedestrians pass by the strip will notice the huge fountain plus its famous water show.. . Other the size, the water blast is also remarkable.  It shoots as high as 460 feet, which is over 40 stories high!  At top of that, it got great lighting and music to make a perfect harmony. People of all age would enjoy this fountain, at first it appear this would be a great for romantic setting.  But kids would love this since the water blast is so cool.  . . You can great view from the Paris Hotel, few of the outdoor restaurant in Bellagio, and of course the room in the Bellagio themselves. A Las Vegas trip is not completed without a visit to the Fountain Show in Bellagio; I think if they added more recent music would be a nice refresh or color led.  The show run every 15 minutes from 3pm or earlier depend if weekend or holiday is. Which is a good crowd control.
I think my favorite part about Bellagio are the Fountains. Sure the flower encrusted ceiling is fascinating but the feng shui is horrid. . The fountains, however, are perfectly placed. See them while brunching at restaurants like Mon Ami Gabi or Sugar Factory or even better, stop by for the evening show where an anonymously beautiful italian voice sings harmoniously with the movement. Imagine standing hand in hand with your significant other and gazing at the fluidity. Its quite romantic and makes for such a pretty sight.
There's not much free in Vegas - this one is and well worth your time.  See the day and evening shows.
You can't come to Vegas and not see the dancing water, common! . . The fountains are lovely. It's a spectacle. It's awe-inspiring, it's marvellous, wonderful, stunning! Is that enough adjectives now? Seriously, I'm being legit - it's the absolute dog's bollocks as Londoners say. . . The water shoots up to insane lengths, the fountain dances to well known tunes, there's such a long pavement in front of the fountains that you're bound to get a place to stand and enjoy. . . Don't leave Vegas without going here and Volcano, capisce?!
Amazing!
Oceans 11.  . . Always reminds me of the closing scene.. . A Classic remembrance of today's Vegas.
