Went on 12/30/13. This place is overrated.  The dance floor is too small. Too many stairs. $18 for a redbull/vodka! I prefer XS instead.
Loved this place.  . . Came on a night when Calvin Harris was spinning and still got in without a glitch - my girls and I did come early though.  . . I wish I'd read Katie B's review earlier though, as I did get my cell phone stolen here as well.  With that being said, however, this club has the nicest bouncers EVER.  I basically bugged ALL OF THEM to help me find my phone and they were all super nice about it.  . . Notwithstanding that, my friends and I had a great time.  I don't think the place ever got too crowded (which is a huge difference from when I saw Calvin Harris spin at XS... I literally thought I was going to get trampled to death and left within 30 minutes).  . . This place is kind of small compared to the mega clubs like XS and Marquee but I enjoyed my time here a lot.  I wish I hadn't lost my phone but they get a huge thumbs up for having the nicest bouncers in town.
My boyfriend and I went here twice over NYE weekend to see DJ's Hardwell and Calvin Harris and really enjoyed ourselves. Out of all of the clubs I have been to I have never seen such attentive staff! We bought our tickets for Hakkasan online during pre-sale and printed them via email. We were pleased to find out that the club was directly behind the gold MGM lion and easy to find. We checked our coats at the coat check ($5 on the 30th and $10 on the 31st - which we expected since things are more expensive on actual New Years Eve) and then waited in line to present our tickets. One staff member scanned our tickets and then another staff member checked our IDs and then stamped our wrists. Once more before actually entering the club you get another stamp (I'm not really sure what the double stamps are for but I didn't mind it). You can either take the elevator (Ladies - if you are wearing heels take the elevator!) or walk up the stairs. The main stage for Hakkasan is on the 4th floor and has a lot of space dedicated to VIP areas. As some of the other reviews have stated they will not let you sit or even hover next to the VIP areas. We found a spot at the top of the handicap ramp which has glass panels - this gave me a great view of the stage and also had a little shelf to hold our drinks (if you want this spot you have to get there early though!). The DJs we saw were both excellent and were more of a show than just a DJ set - dancers, acrobats dangling from the ceiling (very Cirque du Soleil), confetti, balloons - it was so cool! I'm not sure what it's like on an "average" night but we were so entertained. The main dance floor gets super crowded and drinks are expensive ($10 for a corona, $18 for a vodka tonic and $8 for a baby sized bottled water), also the DJ's don't go on until super late (Hardwell went on at 1:30am and Calvin Harris right after midnight), but overall we had a good time and would go again.
This is the worst corner of vegas. I was with the most beautiful woman in the club, but this place is an overblown waste of space. Great lighting system, but it was completely wasted by an inc oentirelympetent and unengaged DJ - Tiesto (whom i think was actually taking a nap after pressing play). Bright flashing lasers and confetti drop at the unmixed, silent transition between songs? He took songs like "kids" by MGMT amd basically added the sound of knocking 2 coconuts together to make it both unlistenable and undanceable. DJs are the paris hiltons or kim kardashians of musicians. They are popular because they are famous and famous because they are popular - not due to any inate talent. The $59 for 2 drinks and 2 waters was totally worth the 2:15 hr wait... and that is the guestlist line. Avoid at all costs.
Ran into a promoter who offered out group of girls a free bottle and table. Had to send a picture of ourselves to him in order to be confirmed for the table. . . Arrived at about 10:30 pm. Was able to reach the promoter right away and he took is directly into our table in the hip hop area. The place filled up quick. Glad we had a table or there wouldn't be a place to dance. Its a big club but gets quite crowded. . . Tried to go to the trance area upstairs where tiesto was playing, but it was way too crowded. Ended up finishing our bottle and back to the casino for gambling.
I read the reviews prior to heading to Hakkasan to see Tiesto. I can't relate to the stairs being an issue(as previous reviews stated) there's really not that many stairs. But out of all the night clubs I've been to, this one is by far the worst. It was extremely overcrowded(fire code violation much?) and the dance floors are practically non existent. The DJ in the hip hop room (which was drastically less crowded) was mediocre at best. The only reason I gave it two starts over one is that fact that it is a nice looking place. As a group we decided, no matter what DJ is playing here, to stay away.
So.... I'm not really a fan. I'd been wanting to check out this club for ages, so when I finally got an opportunity to, I was really excited. Of course, you can't go a mile in Vegas without seeing advertisements for Hakkasan, their lineup of amazing DJs, and hearing about how huge and wonderful it is.. . Unfortunately, huge doesn't always mean wonderful. (wait...that didn't come out quite right)... ANYWAY, we luckily got in right away, without waiting in the long madhouse of a line, but as soon as we got onto the overly packed elevator, I got nervous.  I know it is a nightclub, but there HAS to be a better way to control crowd flow!! The first floor we stopped on was the hip hop room/floor.  The music was fantastic! However, that was the only fantastic thing happening, because the air conditioning was either not on, or severely malfunctioning.  It was like being in a musical steam room with hundreds of people sweating. Even the bartenders were complaining and sweating.  I seriously felt like my face was melting off.  Obviously, we couldn't stay there, no matter how good the music.. . Next, we went up to the main area. The difference in temperature was quite noticeable as soon as we got to the stairs. It went from the equator to the Arctic- but it felt amazing! We climbed the stairs (which was scary- steep stairs + high heels + masses of drunk people= recipe for disaster), and went into the main area. I will say, the light show and effects were gorgeous, but we were crammed in like sardines. Worse than that, you could not move. We seriously had to shove to walk forward, let alone finding a spot to even stand without being pressed against hundreds of strangers.  I was about to have a panic attack.  We stayed for *maybe* 10 minutes, when we decided to just get out of there.  Leaving was afeat in and of itself too.  . . Between the stairs, the elevators, the poor crowd flow, the narrow walkways, and the air conditioning issues, I HIGHLY doubt that I'm going to return to Hakkasan.  This wasn't even a holiday or fight weekend- I can only imagine how bad it gets at other times.  I'm sorry, I'm going to have to party elsewhere.
Went to Hakkasan (formerly Studio 54) during its opening weekend last year... I must say it's probably my favorite new club to party in Las Vegas. Place is massive. 5 floors, isnt it?? You can get lost in there. In a different way than getting lost inside Marquee. The sound and the lighting in both the main room & the Ling Ling are really good... really good. I'm sure they spared no expense. To me, it has raised the bar in Vegas nightlife experience.. . Fortunate enough to have a friend of a friend that works there as a VIP host so he set us up with our bottle service reservation inside the Ling Ling. The Ling Ling room is downstairs and is primarily known as the hip hop room. The night we went we had DJ Krooked from Skam Artist crew spinning. We're lucky enough to have some friends that are DJs under the Skam management so they were able to tell Krooked to shout out my friend for his bachelor party. Good times. The music was good. The bottle service hosts we had were super cool, not to mention, beautiful... One nice thing they thought of at Hakkasan was that at our table in the Ling Ling, the seats had storage space under for the ladies purses.. and phone charger connections for EVERY phone imaginable. Hell yesss!! Everyone knows, by that time of the night/morning in Vegas... your phone is dying, if not, already dead. I truly believe they thought of every thing when they designed this club. . . We had friends that same night who had bottle reservationsabove the main room who had Laidback Luke performing that night. We went to go check it out and it was also amazing. The music being played, the laser/light show, the performers on stage, the performers/dancers above the stage, etc.. Everything was top notch. Im sure bottle reservations in the main room are much more than the Ling Ling and for some people it is more than worth it. I can see why.. . That was my first time at Hakkasan... We went again in November and once again got bottle service in the Ling Ling through our connect there. And once again our bottle hostesses were super cool and super lovely. We had a great time... If it wasnt for the homie discount, I'm not sure we would be getting bottle service every time, as I know it can get insanely pricey depending who the headliner is for the night. Tiesto, Calvin Harris & Avicii are all resident DJs there. Now I am in now way an EDM junkie but even I know those are the heavy hitters. The night we were there the Ling Ling had DJ Gusto, another Skam Artist DJ. The main room was Dada Life. Music inside the Ling Ling was really good playing that typical Vegas Top 40 hip hop & some classics mixed in. We went to check out the main room and Dada Life had the crowd going insane. Found myself on the main room dance floor and the energy was amazing. Gotta love Vegas for that.... . . Check Hakkasan out. My advice. Get bottle reservations. The line to get in on a busy night in which a big name DJ is performing or if it's a fight weekend will be ridiculous. I highly suggest getting a table, if not... Buy pre-paid tickets. Too much stress going on. Too hectic... You'll see. Still... Gotta love it tho. Hakkasan is great classic Vegas times... Cant wait to go back. . . We want DJ SKRATCHY in the Ling Ling room, please... And more of DJ VICE in the main room.
My friends and I went on 1/4/14 to see Tiesto spin. I'm a huge EDM fan so was super stoked. . . First, the positives. the sound and light show was impeccable. Tiesto never fails to disappoint  and this was the case here. . . Now the negatives. The place is dangerously crowded. Crowd /flow is not at all well controlled. There were so many people packed on the dance floor that dancing for the most part consisted of being jostled around by people shoving their way through the sea of people. The staff are not extremely helpful in controlling the flow. I wonder if perhaps too many people were admitted..... . From our arrival and throughout the nite we were treated rudely by all the staff...both outside and in. Get over the attitude, guys....so what if I am not a 20- or 30- something with a postage stamp skirt barely covering my derriere and wearing stilettos! I still deserve to party just as much as anyone else!. . I go to a lot of  EDM music festivals and am not typically a big clubber even through I live in a major metropolitan area. However, the chance to party with Tiesto lured me in. I found the whole vibe here to be largely one of entitlement and arrogance which was very unlike any rave scene I have ever been in. . I did converse with some very nice people but they were few and far between.. . The piece de resistance was when, about an hour after we got there, I was getting my groove on and minding my own business.....suddenly a young lady next to me who was obviously rolling started jumping and thrashing about. I held her at bay trying to squirm my way to a safer spot when she suddenly came down on my forefoot with the full force of her stiletto heel. The pain was excruciating. I tried to confront her and tell her what had happened but she just looked at me wild-eyed and slithered away.. . What followed was an escape attempt by my party and I through the throngs of people as I was barely able to stand and almost in tears. I tried to get the attention of security to please help me but was ignored. After a few minutes we made it out with me in tears and limping. Thankfully no fractures but my foot is severely swollen and bruised and it has impacted my ability to do my job and everyday activities. I am in one of those ugly post-op boots for a couple of weeks.. . I agree that no one could have predicted or been responsible for the behavior of this young woman. However crowding of a dance floor to this degree just invites these types of incidents. Its common knowledge that in a rave environment a lot of people are prone to be doing molly, coke or other rave drugs. Therefore, the staff should be prepared to respond to injuries when they do occur. I shudder to think what the outcome would be if there were a serious illness or injury, or other need to quickly evacuate. . . When I arrived home on Monday I wrote a long letter to the club management about my experience and they have not responded at all. Guess that shows how much they care.. . My advice: if you go, wear steel toed boots and a suit of armor. Or better yet, skip the club, save your $$ and come join me at a music festival where you will enjoy a totally different experience without the attitude. And girls....those stilettos are not only extremely bad for your feet and ankles but are dangerous weapons.
Too packed!! We just got out right now! So mad! If u just wanna stand up then go there.. You cant move! Never again.. Too many steps dont wear high heels! Bad experience! You wont be able to even see faces, just shoes coz u have to keep watching your steps and people stepping on your toes. The line looks like a horror maze like a rollercoaster line. Just go to surrender or marquee
The only club with two different sections, to separate the ratchet from the non-ratchet haha. The downstairs part of the club is where the ghetto-ish music was but the bar was pretty long and quick service. I went to the upstairs area, as we were there when Tiesto was the DJ. Upstairs is massive, and has 2 floors of its own, with a nice concert pit like area. They have a couple nice bars, and the ambiance of the concert hall is really nice. The bottle service booths were amazing, and very spacious. They came with a very attractive bartender and at times a bouncer for that bartender. They have nice comfortable couches, and the ladies bring the bottles out with nice sparklers. . . TLDR: Such dancing, amaze music, much wows.
I love my promoter with all the hook-ups and arranging everything for me but I am not sure if I would like to come back. Maybe if one of my favorite DJ's here. . . Like many other Yelpers, bouncers and staff weren't the friendliest. I like to start conversation by asking them how their night is going. And if this is considered a busy night for them. My friend and I went on a pretty dead weekend, where even some of my promoter friends went on vacation (PLUS it was a Thursday!). I mean i sympathize with them that they have deal with drunk princesses or folks out of town that are too rowdy, however it is Vegas. This is when being rowdy is obligatory. . . The DJ that night was playing a mixture of hip-hop and EDM. Don't get me wrong I love both, but transitions were awful. One moment you a nodding to Two-Chains and next moment you are slow dancing to deep trance. I am sure I went on an off night, and there are other nights, other DJs are much better. I was just expecting a little too much of my first time at Hakkasan. . . Please correct me if I a wrong. The reason why they don't offer tap water at Hakkasan is because the water system in Nevada in general sucks butt. I am spoiled by Bay Area water so free tap water seems to be natural. . . I felt like the club was a little smaller than expected. Nevertheless, let's give this another go during the busiest time of the season. EDC Weekend.
I heard this was one of the best nightclubs in town.  Ehhh..... We did the bottle service and since the 4 of us only wanted one bottle, we had no choice but to be sat in the Hip-Hop room, which is the smaller club downstairs.  Of course with all night clubs in Vegas - the bottle service is freaking expensive however if you plan on drinking at least five $19 dollar drinks, you might as well split a bottle and get a place to sit.  The couches were kind of ghetto in my opinion as they are loosely upholstered in a shinny, thick vinyl that looks just cheap.  I am sure they use it because it is easy to clean up puke and women's stiletto heels don't poke through.. The best part of this club was our table serviceman - Allen.  He was on top of it all, quick, polite, fun and made everything very precise. I just hope he get a good chunk of the tip.. Oh, BTW, you can smoke cigarettes nonstop and bother the feck out of everyone but if you light up a cigar, you will be surrounded by security people instantly.. I still think XS is the nicest club in Vegas.
What better way to celebrate my 29th birthday than to try to live it up like I was turning 21? There are many reasons why I don't frequent these "ultra high-end" nightclubs anymore, but I guess it was my lucky day. This was the first time I was on a guestlist with comp tickets and actually got in for free. No cover for a guy in Vegas? Unheard of. There was also no wait in the guestlist line. Dada Life was the headliner. . . Pros: Aesthetics-wise, this nightclub is just as nice as any other. There's a nice lounge with benches for sitting without having to get bottle service. There's three different levels and plenty of space, except the main stage. . . Cons: Stairs - apparently these are death for the ladies. There's no outdoor patio/pool area so it can get stuffy, but there's cool jets that blast the crowd every once in a while. Confetti is dropped every now and then, but the pieces stain your skin, especially the blue ones! The cost of a drink is ridiculous - a Red Bull/vodka was $25. So much cigarette and cigar smoke in an indoor setting.. . Mark Eteson was the opener for Dada Life and was the only person I saw since apparently I'm old now and I can't make it to 2 am anymore. Still, I can say I had fun on my birthday at a Vegas club!
I got drugged within 30 min if being in this club. I was so excited to see Calvin Harris spin but had to be carried out almost instantly. Terrible place and people. WATCH YOUR DRINKS!!!!!!
Nothing too special about the club. I don't like clubs where they make you keep walking because there are stairways or incredible small walkways.. . The music was just ok. I did go during Thursday of CES so it was pretty packed. Didn't have to pay cover and got in pretty quickly so that wasnice. Would I come back? Probably not. Nothing too special and the drinks were pretty pricey.. . Not sure if a club in the MGM will do justice since MGM is pretty beat up. Also hearing stories about cell phones being stolen makes this club sound ghetto.
My girlfriends and I just turned 21 over the past few weeks and decided to come to Hakkasan for Calvin Harris. We were all stoked because we thought it was super cool that there was an area for EDM and hip hop.. All in all we had a fantastic night celebrating and dancing on the 'ratchet floor' but once we went to the main area (EDM stage), things went down hill extremely quickly... . 1) The EDM area was EXTREMELY crowded. We were all packed in there.. 2) My girlfriends got their phones stolen and all my cash was gone within 30 min being in that area. . . It makes me sad because from what I am reading here, it's not an uncommon event at Hakkasan. It makes me more sad that I'm sure they read these reviews and have not upped the security in there. I hope they try to work this situation out with security management because I really do want to come back here because I thought the light work and sound was amazing in this club.. . But until then, I will be exploring other options:
Went here with a group of friends in November. One of the friends got some hookup so we didn't pay to get in and VIP line pass. So couldn't complain about paying a cover charge or waiting forever in a line. The club itself is pretty huge. We surveyed about 3 floors. The look was pretty cool throughout. The house DJ list is impressive too. Tiesto,Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki & Deadmau5. Each floor having its own decor, theme & DJs. Two serious downsides were that it was packed like a sardine can in there. Also the stairs are KILLER. There's only a few elevators so the main route of travel inside the club is taking flights of stairs. I can imagine it's even more a nightmare when one is drunk & wearing high heels. Frankly I'm shocked no ones gotten seriously hurt and/or sued Hakkasan for dangerous conditions.. One person is our group did lose her purse. When she called the next day, fortunately they had it at the club intact. Apparently she had left it at one of the bars after ordering some drinks & the bartender saw it and turned it in.. Like all clubs on the strip. It's no fun if you're not on the list and pay full price after waiting in a line for hours. Always a good idea to get some type of hookup or deal thru a club host or casino or such.
It's just. so. crowded. main dance floor was just a sardine can. People weren't even dancing. . . $9 for a miniature bottle of water.. . Had a hookup so I didn't have to pay $100 to get in to the claustrophobia focus group but DAMN...I felt sorry for all the dudes that did. . . It's centered around making money, not creating an enjoyable experience. The vegas motto lives on.
Definitely NOT my favorite. If I could avoid this club and never come back, I totally would but they have a bunch of great resident DJ's, that it's so hard not to. . . Venue: three floors: main floor is the main stage where all the resident DJ's play and a small dancefloor and two bars to buy drinks,the floor above that is ALL TABLES, the floor below the main floor is the hip-hop room with more tables and a small dance floor and one bar. Oh yah, and you have to use the stairs to go between all these floors because you can't use the elevators (girls, you've been warned). . Drinks: expensive, of course. I mean it's Vegas, no surprise here. . . Why I don't like Hakkasan: . - NO DANCE ROOM. The dance floor is TINY! The first time I was there, (and keep in mind I was sober) I almost fainted! It was so hot and crowded and stuffy that I became light headed. Eventually I had to leave the club to get some air, but oh yah, NO IN AND OUT'S. . . - SUPER CROWDED: I mean yah, all clubs are gonna be crowded in vegas. But like I said above, THERE'S NO DANCE ROOM BECAUSE THE DANCEFLOOR IS SO SMALL!!! Seriously. Aren't you supposed to dance at a club?? HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WHEN THE DANCE FLOOR IS SO SMALL???. . - SERVICE: people here are just not nice. Bouncers are unreasonble and mean. . . Honestly, my review is not biased whatsoever. I've given this club a second chance and a third chance. But my opinion still stands, and not only mine. Almost everyone I've talked to doesn't like Hakkasan. Definitely my least favorite club on the strip.
This place is so unbelievably overrated.  Promoters asking ladies to send their photos?  Bizarre dungeonesque stone walls everywhere that make you feel like you're a competitor on Legends of the Hidden Temple but in 5-inch stilettos?  Never mind the fact that it was clearly designed by an architect who was obviously going through a very serious infatuation with stairs.  Even after taking the elevators, there are just stairs everywhere!  How is this not a liability?  Isn't this exactly what people were complaining about with Marquee?  Terrible ventilation to boot and no outdoor area to compensate for it.. . No thanks.  I'll stick to XS or Light.
Worst Las Vegas club. EVER. I went with a group of girlfriends to see Calvin Harris a couple weekends ago. We got there at 10:30pm as we were told to by the club promoter, and got right in, no problem. It was SO crowded inside at 10:30. The floors are very slick, so if you're wearing high heels or/and if the floor has alcohol on it, you're going to slip. The club is very confusing and it's very easy to get separated from people as there are a million people, several bars and many different floors. The main club level is smaller than some other Vegas clubs and there are far too many people squeezed in. You seriously can't even walk to the bar. We left early because we were so miserable. . . The drinks are expensive and not worth it, or strong enough. I also had a drink get stolen from me because of how crowded it is. My friend got her wallet stolen off of her, and was told it happens a lot at this club because of how many people are crammed in such a small place. . . I'm convinced they have paid these great DJ's a ton of money to have residencies there, because there is no way anyone would ever go to this awful club without the big names. I've been to so many Las Vegas clubs and this one is BY FAR THE WORST. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!
Drinks are EXTREMELY expensive. The place is beautiful, beautifully lit and very high end. I love the decor but the hip hop room was too small. I'm pretty sure numerous people groped my butt, and I two stepped the entire night. Wish there was room for us to sit.
BOOTH-GALORE!. This place has got to have the most booths I have seen at one place. It's cray.. This place is literally covered in booths. Capitalizing!. . We had a booth on the right side of the stage. Sunday is Hip-Hop, fyi.. Rev Run made an appearance towards the end of the night.. . The main dance floor is crowded as hell but we braved it because I needed a change of scene from our booth.. . Then one of the security guards asked us if we wanted to dance upstairs. So we said 'yes,' I shouldn't have been surprised that it was a booth upstairs with guys that wanted girls in their booth. Had a great view of the stage. . . This club used to be Studio 54 back like 3 years ago... full of douche bags. They've been constructing every time we've visited. This is the first time it's been open since I've been there.. . What other Yelpers said about all the stairs is true. All the little levels you have to go up is pretty cray when you think about all the drunk people trying to get around the club. Just sayin'
I hate it when venues way overbook their guestlists. I was in Vegas over a slow weekend and signed up for the Saturday guestlist, fully expecting to get in for free. When I got to the area near the entrance at 10:30 PM, my jaw dropped. The guestlist line was so long it extended to outside of the hotel and started wrapping around. If I lined up normally for guestlist, there was no way I could make it in before the "free" cut-off, if I was to make it in at all.  . . Being a lone rager (hah), I shamelessly talked my way into a group of very nice people near the middle of the guestlist line. Made it in before the cut-off and raged to some Tiesto FOR FREE. So good.. . Wait, no. A makers on the rocks set me back $22 -.- seriously? All you did was scooping up some ice and pouring (no mixing involved) some mediocre bourbon into a cup.. . Way too many stairs for drunk people, who don't always remember to take the elevators.
Had a great time! Unfortunetly they were out of bottle service when we arrived and we had had to get in line. We got in after a short wait no problem though. Alot of stairs to go up but the drunkness didnt let me remember much of it. It was pretty packed but all vegas clubs are. Not as big as some of the other clubs. Cant really remember much of the drink prices because i inly bought one since i showed up already faded. Love the music,only down side i would say not much wiggle room but cant expect much out of a packed night when theres a dj that everybody wants to see. Not my favorite vegas club but wouldnt mind going, bottle service in advanced for sure next time! They have good djs headlining there all the time, the night we went datsik was playing and they tore it up!
Went there for Calvin Harris Jan 27th (or that weekend).  The caveat is that I went in with very very high expectations.  After hearing the rumors about the place,  I didnt really know what to expect outside if the time of my life with nothing but gorgeous women dancing to the best music on the best sound system.. . None of that was delivered.  I won't go much into the crowd there,  bit I'll add that perhaps im too used to the homogeneity or the DC crowd.  The club was, as expected insanely crowded with not much room to enjoy yourself until much later in the night.. . That being said,  the sound system on the first floor was not only insufficient,  but downright unpleasant.  Maybe that was just Calvin Harris and his lack of attention to detail.. . The worst part is that it was in the MGM grand which now feels like a run down place in so many ways.
My fascination with this club started waaaay before it even opened. My husband did the demolition of Studio 54 and some of the construction for Hakkasan, so I was intrigued to see what the final product was all about. . . As I've mentioned in other of my reviews, my "weekend" consists of Wednesdays and Thursdays, so since Hakkasan is closed on Wednesday, I assume it was not as crowded on a Thursday as it is on Saturdays. The nights that I have gone, locals are free, not sure what they charge typically, but free is GREAT! Their resident DJ's are great! I've seen Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Tommy Trash, Nervo, R3hab, Above and Beyond, and Fergie DJ, always a good time! . . As for the negatives. The layout is interesting, like many have said, TONS of stairs. But they DO have elevators, which I've been taking advantage of more often now! As for the main EDM room, it's always packed, either they let in too many people in or they come in from different rooms all at the same time. There are times when the club is so overcrowded and hot that it seems like you can barely breathe! Talk about a fire hazard! Expect typical Vegas prices for drinks; a Grey Goose and Redbull for 28.00 and water for 9.00 is what I've come across =/
