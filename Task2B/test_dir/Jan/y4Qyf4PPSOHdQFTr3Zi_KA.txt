An overall nice casino and hotel. If you are staying at the hotel drive in the East side. If you park on the west side you will have a loooong walk to the check in. They have signature suites on the first floor of rooms so the ads talking about views of the Strip or Red Rocks isn't always the truth. I paid for the suite and got views of the trash cans and parking garage.....not exactly what I expected after paying for the higher price suite.. The flat screens are nice, but would be nicer if they had HD channels.. The Jacuzzi tub in the room was nice although we had to wait 3 hours to get maintenance to come up and show me how to get the water out of the tub. A sticker showing where to turn would be helpful.
Overall a 4.7 easy!. . My wife and I went to Las Vegas for new years to celebrate our 4 year engagement anniversary. Instead of the hectic Strip experience I wanted something more relaxing and Red Rock delivered on all fronts. . . First off  Red Rock is in WEST Las Vegas. Not close to the strip at all. But the location is great. The view of the strip is awesome, big reason I chose this place to watch fireworks, and everything you could want to do is within walking distance or already at the resort.. . We were in a mountain view room with a King Bed and it was incredibly nice as well as very spacious. For the money you are getting a ton of bang for your buck in one of these rooms. The bathroom was also insanely nice with dual sinks and a HUGE tub. I don't take baths but I did in this one because it's the first one that been able to house my 6'3 frame without me having to bend my knees. . . My only quibble with the room was the shower. It was very large and gorgeous with a glass door but the shower head itself looked cheap and lacked a lot of pressure. Honestly it was the only thing that looked cheap in the whole room so it stood out to me. Doesn't make much sense to have such a beautiful bathroom and have something that looks like its from the clearance section in Kmart. The drain seemed a bit backed up as well so water gathered into a puddle at my feet. I found a long black hair in the shower that wasn't mine or my wife's floating in said puddle that grossed me out a bit. But other than this the room was fantastic and really that was the only mishap of the trip.. . In the actual resort Red Rock literally has so much to do that you don't need to leave at all, which we didn't. They have a ton of food options, a nice casino, a bowling ally, and even a movie theater! Seriously we felt a big intimidated because there was so much to do. I have separate reviews for the places we visited there. But we really loved our stay.. . Red Rock really nailed it. The facility is gorgeous and the staff makes you feel right at home. It is a fantastic value for what you get and when we are looking to stay off the strip we will for sure be back. . . P.S. No free Wi-Fi was a bummer I don't get why you should have to pay for it when you already pay a resort fee.
Red Rock is really huge and always packed with people! they basically have everything in this casino: bowling, theatres, bingo, pool, restaurants, great food court, etc. I love going here to play bingo with my parents, it's a fun time. . . it's most likely the top hotel of all the station casinos. and it's a great place for all ages to just wind back and relax!
Of the many times I've stayed in Vegas, this continues to be my favorite spot. I love/hate that it's so far from the strip, but really enjoy being able to rub elbows with locals and relax far away from the traffic and insanity. . . The rooms are incredible. Clean, excellent amenities, deep bathtub/ nice shower, HBO, wi-fi in resort fee, free shoe shining service, extremely comfy king-size beds with fluffy comforters. . . The resort is also my favorite in Vegas. They have a theatre, a bowling alley, full casino, spa, tons of dining options, a club and a lounge. They're also very close to tons of affordable neighborhood options - BJ's, Albertson's - which we like to pick up drinks at or hit happy hour. . . The pool here is beautiful. I love the hottubbing, but have found the pool to always be too cold to swim in, even in summer. Their poolside bar makes great drinks that come in pineapples, though, and you can chill on one of their poolside Cabana bed thingies. . . The two women I worked with at the front counter this visit (12/30/13 - 1/3/2014) were incredibly nice, helpful, and professional - a huge improvement over my previous visit. If you're looking for a unique Vegas experience, I highly recommend Red Rock. You'll leave feeling refreshed and relaxed, not blown-out and frazzled. Already looking forward to our next visit. :-)
My cousin brought my bride & me here for the buffet while we were visiting.  I have to say it is indeed impressive.  . . The food on the buffet was indeed fresh, being made about as quickly as people could grab it up, and the selection was incredble, from asian fruit salads to lobster eggs benedict to standard American breakfast fare.  I think I put on 5 lbs just looking over the options.. . I now know where I expect we will be staying on our next visit to the area.  Plenty of restaurants to choose from andaway from the "hustlers" of the strip.
Like its sister casino the Green Valley Ranch this place is a cozy and modern away from the hustle and bustle of the strip with reasonable prices.  . . I love the location it has a palm springs feel to it and you really are not overwhelmed you can actually relax and spend time with family.
Did a random staycation here and spent two nights randomly. Having nothing on me, but the clothes on my back, I can say that Red Rock has it all. . . First, the room was huge, had awesome views of actual Red Rock, had an amazing bathroom, large jacuzzi jet tub, and large comfy bed. The room had a mini-fridge which was stocked full of beer, booze, and candies (and there was even more snack and booze options as well as a sex kit option on the dresser as well). The only need with our room was the super thin walls and the remote for the tv didn't work well (even after having it changed out).. . Red Rock also houses, slots, poker, blackjack, several bars, a bowling center, bingo hall, and movie theaters. A lovely spa, amazing pools (open year round - they're heated), and a variety of restaurants sure to pleasure your palate.. . The casino is large, has two parking structures on both sides of the property, as well as complimentary valet (one by the main lobby and the other in the west parking garage).. . The Red Rock is great for fun or play and as a locals casino has a great rewards program. Definitely Station Casinos gold star property. Definitely a big, big fan.
Beautiful hotel for off of the strip. If you want to experience a relaxing Vegas... this is your spot. Large and gorgeous pool!
This review is only for our experience in the casino and the buffet.  We were staying on the strip (will be writing a review for that hotel shortly...TERRIBLE!) but went for a hike nearby.  Decided to check out this resort (and look for food).  While walking through, we noticed they had a breakfast buffet for only $6.99 with your "boarding pass", which you can get for free.  The buffet was great!  Tons of fresh fruit, cereal, oatmeal, a pizza station, Mexican food, sushi, eggs of every kind, all the sides you can imagine!  We stuck around and played some slots, checked out the pool area (open year round).  Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful.  The casino, restaurant and bathrooms were all spotless!  This is about 15-20 minutes to the strip, but I would stay here!  If you like to hike, enjoy the outdoors and get some gambling in without the need to be right on the strip I would check it out!
This was one of the best experiences I've had at a hotel.  Great food, helpful staff, and a nice fitness center.  T-Bones is a superb steakhouse, and out suite was comfy and modern.  The casino did a great job of controlling the smoke which is important to me as a non smoker.
Red Rock is just straight swanky... epitome of classy. When you're this far off the Strip, you have to give a little more... scratch that, a lot more. I don't think I could find one thing wrong with this place; the rooms are great, the staff is great, and the selection of restaurants and activities are top notch.. . I guess there is one blemish... why isn't there a night club for dancing?
Great Hotel to stay at. The rooms are very nice and beds are really comfy. The pool is nice and has lots of space around it and its not to crowded since it is off the strip. overall i really like this casino because it is clean and it doesn't smell too much like cigarettes, and they have a Yard house which has great happy hour. Also if your not in the mood to gamble they have a really nice bowling alley and movie theater.
BEWARE . . -- If you have any kind of special needs or have a special request, DO NOT COME HERE!!. -- I am sensitive to UV light emissions.  They assured me that it would be no issue changing out to "regular" incandescent bulbs when we made the reservation. When I called back to confirm, the "engineer" had left a message that there are only LED lights so there are no issues.. -- To my dismay, the room we found not only had LED lights but also lamps in the walls with flourescent lights which does emit UV rays. So I called down to request to have them changed out. The "engineer" responded that would not be possible. HUH?  They can't find 4 regular incandescent bulbs that can easily be purchased anywhere??   . -- I have found two types of hotels responses to my lighting issue:  Either they are customer-oriented or frankly they don't give a rats-ass.  Red Rock falls under the latter category.. -- You may think that I'm being too picky. Is it too picky when you have health requirements?  We, as a population, are getting older, and with age comes a myriad of health issues.  And hotels such as Red Rock will find that with such lack of concern where they cannot be bothered with potential health concerns, us folks, who are not in our 20s blooming with health, will not be willing to patronize them.. -- Frankly, if it wasn't for the fact that we were at the hotel due to a convention and prepaid by the hosting company, we would have left and gone to a much better hotel on the Strip.. -- Lastly, the enclosed shower smelled AWFUL like an open sewer. Clearly the drain needed cleaning out. It smelled like something died in there. During showers we had to breath through our mouths; it made you gag if you breathed through your nose. Given the total lack of response from their engineer to the prior request, we didn't see the point in trying to get it rectified.. -- To add insult to injury, for some reason during our last day there (was there 3 nights), housekeeping failed to clean our room whatsoever. It figures.....
