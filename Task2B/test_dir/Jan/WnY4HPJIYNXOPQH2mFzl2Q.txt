Very nice hotel! Would easily stay here again.. Only bad part is that to get to the pool area you have to walk a mile, with kids this gets to be a pain. Other than that, no complaints!
Stayed here with a group in a standard suite -- AWESOME.. . We're a group of climbers so we stayed here and drove 20 minutes out to Red Rocks to climb during the day. Everyone that worked for this place (yes, even Valet) was very friendly, helpful and patient. The decor was beautiful and modern. The place is really clean and completely luxurious, no doubt. . . The aquarium was pretty cool. The line can get pretty long waiting to get in, so get the tickets and get there early.. . Weoriginally booked for a suite with 2 queen beds, but since those were really popular, they gave us a king bed with a roll away bed WITHOUT CHARGE :) :) :) It worked out for our group. Everything was so clean, suite was a great size (about a little more than 700 sq. ft), nice view of Luxor and part of the strip, and good location to the casino (if you are there to gamble) downstairs with shops and restaurants. In our standard suite, we had 1.5 bathrooms, the full bathroom being very spacious with double sinks, a bath, closed off shower, and separated toilet area. . . Free valet. Pet friendly. Express Checkout is available. If you choose to do self-park, be mindful of the clearance for your vehicle. We drove a 2013 Honda Pilot with a Sky Box on top and the Sky Box was scraping most of the clearance bars. . . We stayed Dec. 26 to Dec. 31st for $1333.48. In my opinion, this place is a whole lot better than the other hotels if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to stay at a luxurious hotel. The standard suite size accommodates a group unlike other hotels that seemed smaller (looked at the sq. ft, haha).
So I got to stay here finnally on the 2nd attempt.. As prev reviewer, I was also tossed around to a MandalayBay "regular" room a couple month ago and I booked here again if there any change.. . This time, they have a room for me,whew.. Well it is a plush nice room with a separate living and bedroom area.  I likeed about a spacious bedroom size, two toilette rooms, separate shower and a hugh bath tub, double sink, marble floor,..... what a luxury hotel room should have.. . Minor cons,. Yup the hot water can be dangerously hot, so be careful.. The wall is somewhat thin that I could here my neighbors conversation in the morning.. . The valet service is quick and very professional.
So, this is a little gem in Vegas. All of the rooms are suites and the prices are exceptional! I think both times I've stayed our lovely suite was ~$130/night. Very clean, quiet and away from the noisy crowd of Vegas - which is a +/- depending on how you look at it. . . The one little downside in my opinion: both times I've stayed, we arrived early (Early, like 8:30am early! But, coming from Austin you only have two options: early or late. SO, we get there early and enjoy a full day. So, when checking into a hotel, we always check to see if there's an available room. We have never been treated badly or turned away if there was a room - - at OTHER hotels.) BTW, my husband and I do Vegas 2-3 times a year.... . The front desk at THE hotel doesn't like it when you arrive early and they let you know. While I will not mention the names, I would hope that the front desk would understand that should a room be open, you should treat and speak to your guests with kindness if you want them to return. Not patronize them reminding them of check in times. Uh, we know the game, thanks. . . . . that's all. :)
No walking through a casino to get to the elevators. All the amenities are so close at Mandalay Bay but the atmosphere is much more sophisticated. The very best service.
There are very few companies that actually care about their customers and this is oneof them. Tosha Tanner reached out to me shortly after this review and told me that the complaints were addressed and made sure that it didn't happen again to other guests. Never have I had anyone care so much to go to extra lengths to set things right, specially not a company large. Customer service really go a long way and this proves it. Thank you, Tosha.
Amazing hotel rooms, friendly people/workers, AND close to the airport! Sorry for this long review but I'm sure it'll help you out....hopefully.. This wasn't my first choice hotel because it's at the start of the strip but you know what? I'm glad I went with this choice! The girl that helped check us in was new and she was very nice and the manager was friendly too! They gladly changed my room to two queens instead of a king for free. . Now they charged a resort fee but I could care less about that. . The room was clean and the TV in the bedroom was eh when it comes to modern (the classic fat one) and the one in the restroom and living room were the flat ones but hey, I'm in Vegas and didn't watch much tv. The only time I did was when my friends were getting ready (girls not knowing what to wear). . They dont have a mini fridge to use for free they will charge you if you touch/use the items at the mini bar (a usual no brainer). However, there's a in room safe which is always a good thing when keeping large amounts of cash. The restroom was nice and the tub and shower were super relaxing. The tub has hotter water than the shower but who wants to be in scorching hot water any way. There were two toilets in the entire suite, both in different rooms which was convinent when the girls were taking forever getting dressed.. Housekeeping did an AMAZING job at organizing and cleaning the room, they are on call so if you are sleeping in until noon and want your room cleaned, just press the button before you leave and they'll come right up for free.. The lobby of Thehotel was very calm, music was nice and the Mix Lounge was perfect for those who want a great view from a bar with happy hour and NOT having the loud DJs and large crowded crowds (but I still went to those too haha).. The are no casinos at Thehotel but they are in Mandalay Bay technically but thats a VERY short walk.. When the sign says "food court," dont expect any McDonalds, these food places are sit down restaurants NOT fast food so there's some sort of elegance. The swimming pools were nice to look at but since we went in January, they were closed. The thing that was sort of an inconvenience was that they charged by the minute at the computers downstairs and printing up tickets, so my advice to avoid this is to make sure you print all the papers and tickets to shows or clubs at home. Would I go stay here again? Yes! The only problem I had was that it was SO far away from the "happening" part of the strip which is probably why this entire hotel and Mandalay Bay was SO clean. But there's always the free tram to go to Excalibur and the public transportation ($8 for a 24 hour pass).
I loveeeee this hotel. I stay here 2-4 times a year when I come to Vegas. That's for my players card I usually stay for free and it's awesome. The staff is soooo friendly and the rooms are nice and super clean. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. Also if you want AWESOME Italian food then you better go to Wolfgang pucks lupo it's amazing and worth the money to eat there.
I love this hotel! Got upgraded to a suit and it was only 70$ for a Saturday night. Pretty cheap and a lot of space. This hotel is super nice and the fact light is here make sit that much better
A little different from your usual Casino hotel - There is no Casino.. . This is an extension of the Mandalay Bay and is a lot calmer and reserved than the usual high passed atmospheres of other Las Vegas Hotels.. . The beauty of this place is the private exclusive entrance that gives taxis a quick and easy drop off to the lobby which is steps away from the lifts to your room.. . A HUGE bonus is the room design. They have a separate living from from the bedrooms and two restrooms. . . The decor looks lovely but tarnished up close. . . A negative is the distance from the the strip it self - could be a positive depending on who you are!
Last year, my husband (then boyfriend) stayed at the Mandalay Bay for our anniversary and loved it. So this year, we thought we'd return as husband and wife to stay at The Hotel, which was equally as awesome! For this trip, we were celebrating my sister-in-law's 30th birthday which meant we spent more time out on the strip than in our respective hotels. That being said, the amentities at The Hotel are great! All of the staff we encountered were very friendly. But we definitely enjoyed our room! We were in the V Suite which was huge! The living room was the perfect size to host our friends for the play-off games since all of the Sports Books were so packed. I'd love to come back during the summer to hang out at the pool.
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100. . Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!. . I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. . . My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!. . Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.. . Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.. . Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!. . Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!. . Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. . . The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!. . Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!. . The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! . . The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.. . The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:. . 1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.. . 2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work.... . 3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.. . I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!
