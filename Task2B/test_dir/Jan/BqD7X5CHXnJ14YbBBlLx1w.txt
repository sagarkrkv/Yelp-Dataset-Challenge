I have to admit that I was pretty drunk while visiting. I can't say much about the place since I don't remember a lot but the one thing that I do remember is the incredibly small tapas. Yes, they're tapas and I understand that but when it comes to lamb chops -- it was a chop .. Some of the dishes were just poorly sized when held against their prices. I feel like it could have been more for the price.
I have eaten here before and it was good so this review is not on food. We were vacationing in las vegas in summerlin and drove all the way to the aria to go to jullian serrano's happy hour. When we got there we were told rudely by the host staff that they are not doing happy hour because there was a convention in town. The second host didn't even look up from what she was doing. No where on the website did it say they were not doing happy hour and how greedy can you be that during a convention you won't serve happy hour because you know lots of people will be there and you want to make more money. This place has lost my business which is too bad because the food is good. If you are at the aria and want a good happy hour go to american fish. The staff is great and the food is served tapas style and is delicious.
We stumbled in here during a business trip for a quick lunch and were blown away by the flavors of the tapas served here.. . Our team shared the following tapas:. Lobster Salad. Ahi tuna tempura. White ceviche. Tuna carpaccio. White anchovy fillets. Traditional Spanish chicken croquetas. Fresh calamari a la plancha. Creamy risotto. . The tapas that hit me as the best have to be the ceviche, calamari, and the tuna carpaccio.  The calamari was fork tender and perfectly accented by the acid, the carmelized onions added the needed sweetness to round out the dish.. . The execution of the carpacio left me wanting to order another order, but I had to sustain.  The carpaccio is sliced thin and placed over pine nuts that gave the dish a perfect, and when I say perfect I mean crunch.  The vinaigrette was refreshing while not being too overpowering of the fish.. . The restaurant is beautiful, and the fun vibe of Tapas makes it a great experience.  A must check out if your in Vegas and anywhere near the Aria Hotel.  Price is on the high side, but quality, service, and most of all flavor get the high marks for me.
We had a company dinner here. Although the service was rather slow( took them a while to bring our drinks and refills), the food is quite nice.. . My favorites: Potatas Bravas, Ahi Appetizer, pan manchego, mushroom risotto, Rabo de Toro and the amazing Red Sangria. . Disappointing:the spinach salad and the absolutely horrible paella. I was looking forward to it, but the flavors were way off and the rice was over cooked. This is one dish that almost no one on our party ate.. . I would come back for some drinks and apps, but would skip the paella for sure.
When I feel like enjoying an awesome meal with tons of variety, Julian Serrano is my go to place. I have yet to have a bad plate of food here. The price isn't the cheapest, but I know this walking in the door. It usually costs me around $200 for 2 people with a few drinks. Some of my favorite items: Brava Potatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Short Ribs, Croquetas, Imported Spanish Ham, and the Crispy Chicken Breast Plate (the peppers and chorizo complete this plate perfectly) Finally, the best item on the entire menu are - THE CHURROS. Simply the most fresh, and delicious dessert you will taste. Don't waste your time dipping it in the chocolate sauce though, it takes away from the churro experience!! Enjoy!
Excellent!  One of our favorite restaraunts in Vegas. Only down side, tad pricy but worth it.  Highly recommended.
Gourmet tapas is about the only way to describe a place like this.. . I came recently with a date and was immediately struck by the open atmosphere.  It is simple and modern - almost like a fine cafeteria - but it works.  It doesn't feel too stuffy for its price or its setting, and yet due to the decor and the staff it still feels like it has a touch of class.. . We ordered several things off the menu, with a few winning and few losing.  The lobster gazpacho was... a bowl of cold soup.  It was started with a tapioca capsule of soup on your spoon, and the overall taste was light and refreshing with a hint of cucumber.  But at the end of the day it was still cold soup.  If you're into it - you'll probably dig it.  I was not.. . The winner was the creamy mushroom risotto.  Absolute simple brilliance.  It was just delicious.  I can't and won't say too much more other than it is definitely worth an order.. . I love tapas places because you can order a bunch of things and come away with a decent tasting for a decent price.  Julian Serrano essentially delivers this, with a place a few steps up on the price rung than the rest.  It was too expensive, about $35 a head without drinks.  But it was enough to make you wonder whether all of those orders you'd happily picked out were worth the price after they were finished.. . Go.  Enjoy.  But choose wisely if you're picking up the tab.
Great food, horrible service.  Service can make or break a good meal, and unfortunately the horrible service overshadowed the delicious food.. .  We dined on Saturday, 2/9, at 9:15.  I originally had made a reservation for 12, but 2 people did not make it. The hostess and server adjusted our table no problem.  Once my whole party arrived we were seated. After that, service declined until I spoke with the manager, Carlos.  . . Our server was Janice and it appeared from the beginning as if she had checked-out for the evening.  Once we were seated we were handed ONE drink menu by our unknown server at the time.  Everyone was getting a little impatient while they waited for the drink menu to reach them.  It would have been helpful if water was at our table before we were seated.  I asked Janice for another drink menu then she brought over a couple more in ipad form.  Thank you. . . I also had to ask about the specials and the prix fix menu I read on the website.  Janice did not opening offer this information to us and did not communicate it to the whole table.  One of the girls in my party communicated our options to rest of the group.  Everyone except one person in our party opted for the Chef's Special Selection Menu, but Janice did not know that because she didn't bother going around to ask each person what they would like to order -  she assumed everyone was opting for the chef's menu. Someone  had to tell Janice that one person wanted to order off the regular menu.  . . Janice is not all to blame for the lousy service.  The bussers and food runners were not on top of things and appeared not to communicate with one another.  A food runner brought our paella and Janice had to take it back to the kitchen.  After I spoke with the manager he informed me Janice would try to be more attentive.  Janice was great at refilling our waters and sangria, but she was still not very friendly towards us.. . I appreciate Carlos for sending out dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the poor service, but unfortunately the poor service really did break our special group dinner.  . . I recommend assigning a more outspoke and friendly server to large parties in the future.
Made a reservation through yelp and specified a gluten allergy. We got an awesome table and the waiter already knew about the allergy. You can't beat the atmosphere and service here. The front house guy was helpful in choosing a wine and even gave me a tasting before I bought a glass.  The portions are small plate style, so assume 2 per person if one is meat and 3 per person if choosing from any of the other categories. The kale salad is good, a bit oily. Beef short ribs we tender and the glaze was awesome. The highlight and must have was the chorizo- the perfect amount of warm hear, crispy outside, juicy inside, and topped with a mini roasted potato.  The dessert was delicious as was all of the food, and although I loved the pistachio tart, it is definitely a warm cookie and not a tart. Sounds weird but the flavor of the crema catalana was reminiscent of Trix cereal- ok, but I wouldn't get it again.
Great tapas bar in aria..tuna and raspberry so amazing..the patron peppers were great..and loved the beet salad. .great tequilas too
I'm not a big fan of tappas places, but this place really blew me away. We came here for a friends bachelorette party and it was all around a great experience. The decor is very dark and chic, the food is delicious, the wait staff is incredibly nice and friendly. The portions were way too small, but then again we were a party of 16 and it's a tappas place so I'm sad that I didn't get to try everything we ordered, but I definitely want to come back and try more of their dishes.
