This place is not unlike a Cheesecake Factory. I had a FatTire and the Kobe burger. The burger was very good. I also tried theenchiladas and the angel hair pasta with shrimp. Everything here seems to be on point. Service is excellent. I came here with a long time local who recommended the place. A must go if in the area.
Food in Las Vegas is expensive. Thank goodness for Lux Cafe. The portions are amazing and the price is reasonable. Staff are also very nice. . A lot of people have been comparing it to the Cheesecake Factory, and well...they ought to because it was created by the same company. . We stayed at the Venetian, so it was a convenient place to grab breakfast. For those of you who (like us) don't get up early enough before lunch closes at 11am, don't worry because they still have breakfast items available on their lunch/dinner menu.
Shrimp scampi is just phenomenal.  Also had their ahi ceviche which for someone like me that hates onions, I completely loved it.  And just tonight I had an omelette that was to die for.  Not overly cooked just perfect, eggy, buttery goodness.  Paired it with the spinach dip as an appetizer and I was a happy camper.. . Another tidbit, try their garlicky shrimp dish it's also pretty freaking fantastic.  Just make sure your date eats garlic or doesn't mind the fumes.  Or just bring a whole pack of mints or chewing gum.
The portions here are huge.  I was a bit sick this time around so all I had was the mango salad.  Can't review it this time around since my taste buds are off, but the salad was still good considering I was sick.  Will update it next time I'm in vegas.
Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls.... amazing! . . I am a huge cafe fan. I love them. This cafe inside the Palazzo is awesome! The staff at the bar is hilarious and friendly. Alex, one of the bartenders knows his stuff. Everything that he has ever suggested for me to eat from the menu has been delicious. . . The appetizers are some of my favorites and Nadia (I think) makes a mean Texas Tea. . . I have only ever sat at the bar, so I cannot comment on the dining areas, but usually it seems so fast paced and everyone on top of their game. . . Try out this cafe if you are in the neighborhood.
The food and service were excellent, as usual. Great fresh bread, great selection of delicious salads. The waffle with strawberries is delicious with a crunchy outside, soft inside. The ribs are good and I really like the coleslaw. The entire menu is good, so while it's hard to choose a meal, it's impossible to go wrong.. Only 4 stars because they got rid of the Max Burger with braised short rib. Also, the table behind us was left uncleaned for over 30 minutes on the indoor patio facing the casino. Our table was cleaned by the hostess, so something is wrong.
This rest is away better than cheese cake factory.. Cheap andbig portion of foods.. Staffs were friendly too. I ate jambalaya noodle and my husband ate veggie burger..both of us were happy to eat our foods.. I did not understand why people did not like this rest.
Review for breakfast buffet and service only. Was not too impressed by the breakfast spread. For $18 I kind of expected a little bit more. The service was excellent, and refilled OJ and coffee quickly, so that helped. But, the food options at the buffet weren't labeled, and there were pretty minimal in the way of healthy options other than a fruit platter and some granola. I'd expect more when the hotels nearby have such lavish buffet options for breakfast.
Found this little gem while we were walking around the venetian.  It was midnight and had to order from their night menu but the food was delicious! The serves was amazing too. We decided to come in the next day and the same results.  This is a must while in vegas and the prices were very reasonable! !
I love Grand Lux Cafe! The first time I came here was for second dinner after the first dinner had ended in much disappointment (some cafe at the Wynn before watching a show, ugh, never again). I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and the portion of the salad was so large, I couldn't finish it (I eat a lot). Service is also friendly and attentive. Ordered another salad the second time I came back but it wasn't as good as the ahi tuna salad. The bread that you start off with though is excellent. I can eat the wheat one for days. . . Anyway, it's my to-go spot for late night eating in Vegas (: I would say it's way better than Cheesecake factory.
Grand Lux is always a good time. The food is consistently delicious, I've never ate something here that I didn't like. They're also open later than the norm, so that's also a big plus for me. I've never had a less than satisfactory time here until yesterday. The boyfriend and I went in for dinner, it took about 8 minutes until we were even greeted at our table. The server never introduced himself (we later found out his name was Joseph from our tab), we had to ask about 3 times to receive the beverages we ordered (a beer, water and an iced tea), his table side manner was just..plainly put, rude..he wasn't attentive, I felt like we were an inconvenience for him by being there. With all the different places I can eat, especially on The Strip, I'm not sure I'll be coming back to Grand Lux, definitely not any time soon, or in 2014 for that matter.
The Grand Lux Cafe reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory with a much larger budget.. . The menu is just as varied, with soup, omelettes, burgers, and other diner fare. There's also the emphasis on dessert and drinks, and the classy ambiance made possible by cushy booths, high ceilings, and mood lighting.. . However, The Grand Lux Cafe upped the quality quotient of their goods a good amount. Bread, potatoes, and veggies are fresh -- as they should be.. . Shame about the runny eggs.
I was on the hunt for a baked sweet potato.  Husband really really wanted one.  I finally found Grand Lux Cafe had it and made the reservation for 16 people.  . . But they didn't have sweet potatoes!  I was bam boozled by the online menu.  . . Think Cheesecake Factory.  Giant menu with 1000 of food choices.  Good prices and hefty portions.  Our entire bill was $300, which is a steal in Vegas.  . . Didn't love it, but can't complain.
Its oooohkay. People compare it to cheesecake but I like cheesecake much better. The menu is all over the place. The Asian chicken nachos were pretty legit. Other than that it may have been that we were just too tired to enjoy it. They do give you sizeable portions, so beware.. . The good thing is you can pretty much walk in and get a seat. There are so many great buffets for the same price though. Not memorable enough to go back...
Cuban sandwich is bomb!!! Definitely try the Caesar salad also. Everything I tried was super heavy on the pepper, just the way I like it. SERIOUS knock off of Cheesecake Factory...
I really liked this restaurant. I would give it four stars if it wasn't for the server we had. I can't judge the whole server core only ours. The server was really short with my girlfriend and I; acted as if he did not want to serve us. This was for breakfast. I ordered the chicken and waffles, I asked for dipping sauce and it took him so long to bring it, I nearly finished all my strips before he brought it too me. I'm usually not the one to complain or petty about situations but the restaurant was not even full. In my opinion it was unacceptable service. I'm just giving credit where it is due.
I love the quality and variety of food as well as the prices. They also have a nice breakfast buffet. This is a regular stop when I'm in Vegas.
For years, the Grand Lux was the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas in my opinion.  I don't know if that's true now, places like Central at Caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  But, Grand Lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.. . The menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks.  Most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor I've taken to Grand Lux.  The fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  They are made like traditional spring rolls, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  The Grand Lux Burger Melt is another menu item I've ordered more than once.  Served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  Certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.. . More than once, I've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  It's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  But, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  I prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  Since Venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.. . Finally, I love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  I get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.. . Service can be spotty during peak hours, but I've never had any major issues.
My husband and I stopped in last night for a small bite after a show (we had an early dinner at B&B, which was delicious). We split a pepperoni pizza and each had a cup coffee. Unfortunately, by the time we walked to the parking garage to drive home, we were both violently vommitting into a trash can. Something was obviously poorly prepared. We're still feeling ill from the food.
Good price and tasty. I just ate at their cafe located next to the theater and had a salad ( only $6 and huge!!) and a cake ($5 and fresh). This is very reasonable price!!
I friggin' love breakfast at the Lux. And don't be afraid of the line that forms in the front. It usually moves fast. I can't remember the name of the pancakes I got last time, but they were amazing. I think it was some kind of pecan caramel pancakes. So good. I was only disappointed that it didn't come with eggs or bacon or the usual breakfast sides, so I had to order those items a la carte, which turbo boosted my bill. The orange juice here is freshly squeezed. . . Great place for breakfast if you don't feel like spending the money and doing the whole Bouchon thing!
In town for a convention at Sands Expo??. . This is the spot if you need a quick grab and go lunch! There are prepackaged salads or you can order off the regular menu. . . During a convention this dining room at this place can be a mad house so I much prefer the go to option. . . The best deal and item is the chipotle chicken salad for under $7 and it's huge. Great dressing, generous amount of tender and juicy chicken plus a bag of tortilla strips to sprinkle on top. . . The to go area has a few seats but usually not enough. You can always walk to the food court and eat it there or take it back to your room.
Like most people have described, it is like the cheesecake factory. I would also give the cheesecake factory 3 stars for these same reasons (to help you gauge my scale here). I place a lot of weight on the food quality and taste at a restaurant (go figure). Unless the server were to throw food on me and break the plate over my head I wouldn't take away more than a star for service. That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.. . If you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too. If you want a place that has ingredients that were never frozen and prefer a more natural and fresh taste, I think you will have to look elsewhere.
Went there on a Sat evening about 730pm. Seated quickly. Lady that seated us collected extra silverware, napkins, and plates. I traded my bread plate as it was dirty. She took my dirty one and put it in the cabinet with the clean ones. Strange. Food was good. Service was great. Our waiter was Paul, and he was 1st Class. Can't give a higher rating this time due to hostess not paying attention to the dirty dish. I did notify waiter.
good for a hangover but I swear they got a timer going with each waitperson about table turnover... nothing special avoid the breads or toast, or pancake... just get the eggs , omelettes etc... and potatoes... can't go wrong.
Spaghetti Carbonara to die for. Desserts wonderful. Busy, bustling, a little loud but wonderful old-school cafe. Don't let long line deter you, they get you seated promptly.
I'm from Houston , and visit the glc location here often. Of course when I'm in Vegas, I eat here! . . I've stayed in the Venetian twice, and both times dined here, it's just that good.. . This last time, I celebrated my 10 year anniversary and renewed our vows... Dinner reception was here of course. I had no issues reserving a table for 12, and enjoyed our dinner . Great service, and great food. The menu is very diverse, from tacos and burgers, to pasta and salads.  There's even a breakfast/brunch buffet in the morning for $18... It includes coffee and juice too!. . I love this place, it's just plain delicious.
I loveeee this place!. . Good 'ol yelp lead me to this wonderful place! The bread is pure deliciousness. I ordered the steak with toasted Brussels sprouts and mash potato. OMG. The Brussels were sooooo good. They were crispy with bacon I believe. The steak had mushrooms! I'm a huge mushroom fan so that was nice. JBH ordered one of the pasta dishes. It was a tomato basil mozzarella pasta very simple and good! We did find a piece of hair in it.... the manger came by to apologize & handled it very well. I appreciated that. They offered us a salad or soup on the house and asked if we'd like a new dish. JBH liked the one he had chose so he just ordered the same thing. Oh yeah the pasta had grilled chicken! It was cooked quite well. I tend to not order chicken because places always cook it so dry! But not here that's for sue. I'd definitely come here to try something else. Their menu has many options & it was kindof hard for me to decide lol. This always happens to me.
