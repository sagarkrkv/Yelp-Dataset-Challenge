This used to be my favorite spot in Vegas, until XS opened. The main thing I love about this place is that you get an "all in one" package, You can make reservations at the restaurant, have a couple of drinks then head over to the club and dance the night away. You don't have to rush or take a cab from one place to another and waste time. My only complaint is that it gets WAY too packed after 11pm. To a point where you feel suffocated and end up wanting to leave.
I don't get it.  We had bottle service.  The drinks were meh.  The music wasn't much better.  I couldn't get my dance on.  Tao kept launching streamers in the air which of course landed in my champagne each and every time.. . Strict dress code.. . *Please keep in mind that I am not a clubber, I like to lounge Hollywood style.
Service so poor, they would not even let me in. I came with 6 friends, 3 guys and 4 girls. Excellent ratio, no? We dressed to the nines, waited in line. . . Got near the front and I was stopped by a bouncer who searched my bag, and then told me that I was not allowed to go in because of my camera gear. It was just my SLR with some lenses and a flash. The bouncer granted entry to everyone else with cameras and smartphones, but not me. Maybe he was also a photography hobbyist and was simply jealous of my equipment? Maybe he was worried about me being a paparazzi, even though my gear was nowhere near paparazzi status and I was clearly here, dressed up, with my friends, to have a good time?. . If you are going to have customers post photos of your venue on Yelp, they might as well be good photos. Now they can keep their bad photos and bad publicity. I'll keep my Tao Nightclub virginity.
A good Vegas club. Not my favorite but I did have fun. They played a good mix of club and hip hop music that kept me dancing most of the night. . . It can be crowded, especially when a celebrity is there. When I was there in February of 2012, Lil John happened to be there too. He had a vip area on the dance floor that made the area very crowded.
Another walk along memory lane.. I first came here almost 10 years ago, back again now not much has changed.. Service is great, drinks are unique, everything is clean and spacious, I love the decor.. Though if you are trying to have a relaxed night out, this is not the place for you, it gets REALLY noisy.. Prices are Vegas average and the crowd all over the place, great time every time.
Club Tao was actually very entertaining. The music selection was good and very diverse. The interior was spacious with nice decor that complimented the scene in a good way. The only bad thing was a misunderstanding that cut our visit short. I hate to say our race is the reason the situation was handled the way it was, but that's indeed the only reason I can think of. A very nice Vegas club but unfortunately my experiences here have made me not want to visit again.
After all these years, Tao is still a heavy hitter in the Las Vegas nightlife scene.. The lines still circle out to the shoppes, and the line up/guest appearances are still on point. . . Although it is crowded, and the layout isn't too friendly for walks to the bathroom... I give it a thumbs up! But ONLY if you are getting bottle service, because where else are you going to stay the whole night??? And you know I'm your girl to contact if you need the hook up on VIP table reservations in Vegas!
I always get mixed feelings about this club when I am here. I get lost in the club when I am dead sober. The set up is a little confusing since its a lounge, club, restaurant. One moment I am dancing one moment I am joining an old couple for dinner. . . But I have to give this club credit for having Avicii in 2010, this was where I discovered my appreciation new artists and the burst of "Levels" and "Penguin" before it changed into "Fade into Darkness". The club has a small dance floor 2 big bars perpendicular to the dance floor. A bigger lounge by the entrance and a smaller lounge in a different room across from the dance floor. Confusing much? I am confused as I write this. . . The staff here are a little bipolar. There is absolutely no rowdiness when you are in line. You will be charge of drunkenness and they will send your a$$ home. I remember one time my friend's feet hurt so she was limping a bit, and she had to leave the line until she was "sober" enough to stand back in line. The promoters and hosts are the best though, by far the most accommodating for high maintenance bay area girls.
We had a bottle service and it was a nice atmosphere. The servers were great and paid attention to what we needed. I could tell they were annoyed with all the people hitting on them, but that is to be expected. The only real problem I had was the dance floor was so packed you couldn't barely move. Also, where a raincoat, girls will spill drinks all over you on the dance floor while dancing. Other than the annoying women coming over wanting free drinks and me constantly telling them no, it's a nice place none-the-less. Packed with good looking women for you to attempt to hit on. Definitely would go back and party there again.
This is the most overrated nightclub.  Do not waste your money.  If they wouldn't have so much business they would know how to treat their guests.
If it weren't for my pretty, experienced friend who found a promoter, I would not be reviewing this. Tao is pretty dim and loud like a lot of night clubs but the entrance and vibe is impressive. After you walk up the stairs to the club, you immediately walk between two display case of nice looking women quietly looking at you whether it's a look of indifference, flirt, or mystery. It's interesting to look at.. The DJ played good, upbeat music, the performers were awesome, the dancers were looking fine, and the crowd was loose. Other than running into 2 old men that were creeping on my friends, it was fun!
3.5 *. -Located in the Venetian; smaller than I though it was. -Waited about 15-20 minutes in line. -Got a table with 2 bottles away from the dance floor which I think was the best option. -Dance floor hella packed but alot of energy and extras. -Table service was good - shout out to our waitress Jennifer who was on point. -Mens bathroom with a line all night but not too bad. -Good ratio for all u singles out there. -Good music. -Other than my friend I had to carry out and take back to the hotel, it was a good night
First off...I'm tellin you: when you get bottle service, you will have an AH-MAZING NIGHT!!!. . My crew and I went on a Friday, January 17 when DJ Turbulence was playing. And omgoodness...he had the best mix I've heard in awhile. A mix of EDM, Top 40s, and your old school hip hop/rap. There was a moment where it was East Coast versus West Coast. They played Empire State of Mind and then it mixed into California Love. You know my entourage and I got turn't up that night!!!!. . Plus rollin' with some VIPS...who couldn't resist drinking $5,000 champagne with all the cocktail waitresses flashing their light sticks on us while we were the center of attention all night long?! ;) BEST NIGHT EVER!!!. . However....with NO BOTTLE SERVICE...it's a mess in here. The dance floor is usually PACKED to the max. To the point where you can't even get ON the dance floor. But honestly...like all clubs here in Sin City...once you get table service, you're golden.
