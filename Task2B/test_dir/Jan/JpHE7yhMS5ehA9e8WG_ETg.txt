The hotel is very nice but the service at ALL aspects is BAD!!! The check in process is horrible. It takes forever! If you've been traveling long, you just wanna check in and relax. Not wait in line for an hour. I requested an extra blanket and they first questioned me (like why do u want a blanket) and then took an hour just to bring it. Then I ate at the cafe vettro for breakfast before I had to go to work and it took FOREVER to take our order, get our drink, and bring our food. . . All in all Aria is nice on the eyes but ANNOYING to deal with.
I do love staying at Aria. I don't require a lot of service when I stay in Vegas, as I don't spend much time in the room. So I can't really comment on that. But I can say that the atmosphere is upscale, and everything is clean and fresh. The casino doesn't have that smokey smell. We stayed in the Deluxe room with 2 queen beds which is their basic room. The beds were very comfortable, the tv is huge (you can connect your iPod), there is a good amount of floor space, and the bathrooms were nicely done and included both a shower and a bath tub. Everything in the room can be controlled by a tablet at your bedside. Including the curtains! The floor to ceiling windows provided a beautiful view of the strip. Aria is pretty centrally located on the strip so it is relatively convenient to get to either end. The pools are clean and nicely maintained. You have to show your room key to get to the elevators, so you can be sure there won't be randoms walking around. It is a bustling hotel and casino with a lot going on, so you'll be sure to be in the center of the action if that is what you are looking for.
So did the group who did Mohegan Sun create Aria?. . Clean, big, and beautiful--that's how I'd describe it.  There's lots of places to eat and gamble.  They even have an area just for Michael Jackson games.  Do make sure you have money a plenty as food alone will kill your wallet.. . I was surprised how much space was used to market Zarkana--a whole store?  Exit through the gift shop, oh yes!. . In full disclosure, I was at the Aria for a conference and spent a lot of time walking through the building and when I say "walking", you really need to be wearing your walking shoes.  The conference center is all the way in the back of the building.  Restrooms are not conveniently located near the conference rooms. They were kind enough to provide water in the back of the rooms as well as a few candies.
Wow! When you walk in the room the drape automatically draw back to reveal a beautiful view of the skyline. Doesn't get much more impressive than this! All the room is controlled by an iPad sized gadget next to bed. At night you can set the TV, lights and drapes to turn off and close at a particular time. So you can lay down and snuggle in then just drift off to sleep watching TV and the beautiful night lights knowing it will all turn off a few minutes later. Even the 'privacy' and 'clean room' signs are automated. The only negatives I would say are that the minibar is one of those that if you pick up something to look at it for longer than 30 seconds you get charged for it. Really? However, the minibar charge for soda was only $3, so it wasn't all that outrageous (for a big hotel). . A helpful hint I would recommend is driving into the Aria from Harmon Ave and entering the North Valet parking. They return your car in just minutes (we tipped about $3 for each time we picked up the car). The North Valet is much closer to the room elevators than any other entrance, and the Harmon Ave entrance isfar better than trying to access from Las Vegas Ave. Always avoid Las Vegas Ave if you can when driving.
Aria is the crown jewel of the City Center.  Beautiful decor that is glamorous and yet refined. As a casino, it could be better, but I think that their purpose was to cater to more of a tourist/leisure crowd.. . Gaming - 2 stars. For a casino of this caliber, they have a dearth of fun machine to play slots on.  The floor has very few cocktail waitresses making rounds, although the areas are kept pretty clean.  The number of gaming tables is a lot less than you would imagine.  Returns on gaming are pretty bad.  I don't think that I have really come up here, and the lack of people makes for a spooky vibe.  There were no hand dealt tables for BJ, all shoes.. . Hotel - 4 stars. Great restaurants always make for a pleasurable stay at a hotel.  Aria is no exception.  One of the biggest perks is that center stage of the casino is John Phillipe Patisserie.  What a great place to get dessert or a bite to eat in the morning.  The rooms are nicely appointed, although a bit small.  I strongly suggest that you do not opt for the smoking room, as the ventilation systems here are pretty weak.  We got stuck with one and the room smelled like an ashtray.  The smell of stale cig smoke was in all of our clothes, luggage, etc.  This was less than a year after they opened, so it must be far worse by now.  Aria probably has one of the nicest bathrooms in a casino.  Strange, but true.  Sometimes, it's those little things that make an impression.
Check-in: SLOW! even more than 5 counters were opened, still had to stand in line for a while. . . Self-Park: FAR! from the front desk. Feel like parking in different hotel? . . Room: High tech~ Once open the door with the key card, TV will turn on, lights will turn on and curtain will open by itself. Very cool~ Remote control pad on the night stand, so convenience. You can control TV, lighting, temperature, music, curtain, etc. Many outlets in the room, perfect to charge many electronic at the same time. . . Mini-Bar: The fridge is completed packed with the drinks they are selling. If you move it, they charge you because all sensors. They are charging $50 service fee per day if you use their refrigerator to store your own item??? I thought refrigerator is part of the amenities in the room?? . . Nowadays, more & more hotel recharging "resort fee". Aria is charging $25 daily which includes access to Fitness Center and WiFi through out the hotel.. . It is an indeed a beautiful 5 stars hotel in Las Vegas. Many great restaurants in the hotel as well. 3 great restaurants have happy hour menu from 5-7pm. Very good price~. . I got a promotion rate, $106 per day + $25 resort fee. They gave me $50 daily credit... yes, spend it all on FOOD!!
The room is very comfortably arranged.  It welcomes you by opening the curtain, turning on the TV with mood music and lighting...Bathroom has double sinks, shower and tub. The best thing is I don't smell the cigarette which many other resorts' rooms have even in a non-smoking floor.  If Aria includes the slippers and jacuzzi tub then I'd definitely give 5 stars!
From a visitor point of view, this is my favorite hotel of MGM resort hotels. Maybe because it's one of their newest on the strip. Everywhere you look is high sense design with Eco and high tech collaborated rooms. Im sure you're going to enjoy your trip here
I love this hotel, from the excellent service to the plush room everything was top-notch!. . We booked the Tower Suite through mLife and could not have been more pleased. We were on the 53rd floor which provided excellent views.. . The room was to die for, spacious and comfortable.  It had 2 large flat screen TV's and a small one in the bath area, comfortable seating in a living area and a dining area that had a wet bar and an extra refrigerator (separate from the minibar) which made saving the leftovers from Aria's excellent restaurants a breeze.. . The bedroom area was spacious and the bed was super comfy.  The pillows were the things dreams are made of...literally, I never had such sweet dreams.  The bath area, well it was the best I have ever had in a hotel.  Large dressing area, whirlpool tub, separate shower with a bench, large closet, and a toilet that well let's just say it was a magical toilet and leave it at that.. . The assorted chocolates left at the evening turn-down service we really good as  well as the turn-down, everything laid out, room refreshed, everything tidied up, so nice to return to, the service was above and beyond.. . I also appreciated the Aria's attention to security, some may see having to show your key when entering the guest room elevator area a hassle, but having stayed at less secure MGM properties (Mandalay Bay to be exact) and seeing the problems of lax security I appreciate the attention to guests safety and security.. . This is our new go to hotel when visiting Vegas.
Check in: Check in seem to start moving fast we were greeted by a service specialist in line and brought over to one of the check out counters to check in (not so good of an idea). The lady behind the counter seemed lost at times and was not that pleasant. So if your room is not ready they will take your information and then text you when it is done. There were five of us and we all wanted a high floor all together she said that would be an issue. So we said do the best you can and she said it would be about two hours. Less than ten minutes later our friend receives a text saying the room is ready. It was but for the wrong people the room and all the amenities that we ordered such as fridge, our chocolates for anniversary. So 3 hours later we go over to find out why our rooms are not ready and we find Raniel (awesome). He told that the person before him messed up the rooms and he took very good care of us. We were placed on the 52nd floor. I recommend getting as high as you can, we had a city view...wow you could see over most of the other casinos..          Room: The room was very clean and modern. It also had a Touchscreen that controlled the room and a big flat screen. The bed is the most comfortable bed that I have slept in by far. The AC worked well and so did everything else. The TV was a little slow in response to you changing channel and volume. It was a decent size and had a lot of room for storage. There is a safe it is in the night stand bottom drawer. Don't touch the stuff on top or in the fridge it's an automatic charge to the room. .  Hotel and casino: Hotel is gorgeous looking lots of cool art and also smells nice. The casino is huge not to crowded limits are high. The sports book is great lots of TV and space to sit down and enjoy the games.  The bars are really nice way overpriced but hey that's Vegas.  The chocolate place also has breakfast sandwiches and coffee, it's a good place to stop and grab a bite to eat. .  Concierge was also good, very helpful we booked out transportation, reservations, and shows through them.  All the services the hotel offered as well as repairs and problem were handled very well and fast..  Overall great stay and I would recommend it and I would go back there too
As soon as you walk into the building it smells like tropical flowers everywhere!! Very beautiful place and the rooms are very beautiful as well! Beautiful views all around and very modern!
it is, like, my third year staying here for CES.  At first it was very nice...automated controls in the room are a nice idea but , not unlike automobiles, the room-automation technology was old when it was launched and now it is just a sad retro feel for what was once 'cutting edge'.. . A big complaint for me (from the beginning really) ...the beds are "domed"...that is, the bed is crowned in the middle...so no matter how you lay you are 'curved'.  bizarre.. Not sure why they do this (water run off...drainage?  it is LV after all), but it is hard to sleep.  Also..pillows are mushy..but two are too much...for a princess like myself these are major issues.. ...otherwise I am comfortable with the hotel.... . Re: gambling...$25 table minimums were the norm and even when we had a full table's worth of players they refused to open a $15 table for us...they lost hours of play that night with that attitude.. . Overall this hotel peaked some time ago from an 'eager to please' perspective...now they are past prime and slowly slipping  (were they acquired in the last few years?  that is usually the death knell for a once decent hotel).. . It is not a poor experience but with a little attention it could be so much better.
I had to come out to Vegas for business to attend CES. I hadn't been to Vegas in nearly 20 years and I wanted to see as much of it as I could (had to have a bit of free time too - why not?) since so much had changed. I split my stay between the Downtown Grand at Fremont and the rest of my time on The Strip at Aria so I could get the "full experience." The difference, as expected, was night and day. I travel on business a lot, and stay in a lot of nice hotels. But Aria was something completely off of my radar.. . Check-in: Aria check-in was smooth as silk. I had booked through the hotel's website (got a great deal, too) and I was able to take advantage of the Express Check-In, so I was able to bypass the extremely long line. I was on my way to my room in less than five minutes. . . Room: After taking a ride up to the 25th floor and went inside, I found the room to be simply spectacular. It was very, very spacious and the decor was very tastefully done. When I stepped further into the room, the lights and tv came on to the services/apps screen and the curtains automatically opened to reveal the most gorgeous view of the city that I'd even seen (I had a king Deluxe with City View). It was facing the Monte Carlo and the MGM and the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Harmon. With the mountain range out in the distance, the view was stunning. Gorgeous. I was a little kid at Christmas!. . The bathroom was very nice and upscale (the shower experience was one of the best I've had in a hotel). The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and the layout of the room was just perfect. I've read a lot of complaints about the Smart Room system being sluggish and ineffective, but I didn't have that problem at all in my room. It was very responsive, relatively easy to navigate and just a pleasure to deal with. I never wanted to leave the room LOL!. . Casino: I'm not sure what the complaint from other reviewers was about all of the electronic slots and electronic gaming on the floor, but nearly every casino in America has moved over to this style of play. But there were still plenty of table games to be had, with lots of poker, blackjack, several craps and roulette and other table games available. My only complaint was the smokiness. While far less smoky than the other casinos I visited, it was still a little more than I cared for (I wonder how well a smoke-free casino would be received?). . . I had far greater success in winning when I played at the casinos downtown rather than at the casinos on the Strip (which I came to learn as a general rule; casinos downtown have less of a buy in, the slots are looser and there's a greater percentage of winning than playing at the casinos on the Strip). I had fun on the Aria floor, but I'd recommend the Golden Gate on Fremont.. . Dining and nightlife: I didn't frequent a lot of the restaurants within the hotel simply because of a lack of time, though I did check out a couple, including The Buffet and the Cafe. While the food in The Buffet was okay, it was way overpriced. I found selections at other casinos to have much more variety, much better food, and at a far more reasonable price. I did not go to any of the clubs within the hotel, again primarily due to time, but also because they seemed to cater to much much younger crowd. And played music that didn't really do much for me. I like house and dance, but I'm more of a jazz guy.. . Shopping: Pretty much anything you want, it's all right there in the hotel. Back in the day, the hotels were pretty much islands to themselves but now, you can almost move from one to the other and never really have to go outside. It was great.. . Check-out: Quick and painless. Aria gives you a ton of options for checking out via email, mobile device, etc. But I wanted to get some clarity on the bill so I went to the front desk. I was seen in no time and the attendant was quick and courteous. BE WARNED: If you pick up ANYTHING in the mini-bar for longer than 20 seconds, you'll get charged for it. They have sensors in the doors and on the outside items that "assume" that you've picked it up to use and/or take with you. Be sure you read over your bill before check out. . . Overall, totally impressed. I truly did not want to leave. Unless someone gives me a reason to go to another hotel or Aria gives me an excuse to leave, the Aria will be the ONLY hotel I stay on my trip to Vegas. Totally worth every penny.
Ok - I have no bone to pick with this hotel.  The rooms are very modern and well-equipped.  Beds = amazing.  The hotel itself is very clean and is scented with something yummy.  But to be honest, I don't think I'd choose to stay here again.  . . It's very open, almost TOO open where it feels more like a convention center than a hotel.  It's also missing the typical "vegas effect" - there's no theme, no wow factor, even the casino is kind of forgettable.. . If you're looking for a hotel with nice rooms that's easily accessible to leave and hit up the rest of the strip, Aria is great.  Personally, I'd go for Wynn, Palazzo, or The Cosmo if you're gonna pay the premium anyway.
Since I wrote my initial review, I've been back several times for work meetings.  I still avoidthe metal clams underneath the check-in desk, but they've converted me to a fan.  The rooms are incredibly modern compared to other rooms on the strip.  One of my preferred places to stay in Vegas!  Great quality value for your money!. . The staff still say hi to you in the halls!
We've stayed at the Aria several times in a deluxe room and a corner suite.  It's a beautiful modern hotel and we love all the shops and restaurants.  I also enjoy the poker room here.
This place is magnificent! The room was amazing with lots of high tech features. I will stay here every time i visit Vegas!
The Aria was great! The room was really modern and had a nice breath taking view. The bath and shower are really nice. The Buffett was good with plenty options. Everyone was polite and friendly from the Aria staff. The only sour person we came across was a lady at the Players Club Counter. "Demonica or Domenica" whatever her name is. She was rude, cold, flat out crap service. She didn't tell is about any offers Aria had going or games that went on. If Aria has more people like her I'm not interested in returning. I hope Aria corrects that.
Amazing place! Stayed here during a friend's birthday weekend. The restaurant served first rate cuisine. Overall extremely classy place. You won't be sorry!
Modern rooms. Good location. Solid customer service. Had some dialogue with a manager in advance about a special occasion and appreciated their help.
Stayed here last week for 4 days. I do realize that sometimes the remote by the bed works and sometimes it doesn't. However I still love the fact that the curtains open with alarm.. . I did notice this time the room had a skunk smell. I think it was the pipes or previous guest smoking something? haha..  I didn't get a chance to tell the front desk since I was here for work and was barely in my room but it wasn't overpowering but noticeable. I still like the room though since it feels really clean and modern.. . I won about $1,400 from the penny slots so it definitely made me a fan of Aria. My favorite games to play here are blackjack and slots. I don't think craps is that good here since I've never won much but for blackjack and slots I'm up. Maybe it's just the vibe of this place?. . If you have mlife be sure to charge everything to your room. You can also link your southwest (600 points) so you get points and/or Hyatt membership number to accumulate stays. I only did mlife and southwest since they allow only two programs.
Beautiful 5 star hotel... Yes. But first class... No way.. We stayed 6 nights, and the best part was the uber comfortable bed we had in our room. Seriously... It was like sleeping on a cloud.. Now onto the nitty gritty... First the resort fees are an extra $25/day which is normal for Vegas. But upon investigating I discovered that the fee only included pool  and fitness room access, a newspaper, and free WIFI. The pool is closed for the winter, the hot tub closes at 5pm, the fitness center closes at 8pm, you must walk down to the shop and show them your room key every morning for the newspaper, and the WIFI is slow (plus every time you turned the screen off on your mobile device, you had to log in again). Next on the list is incidental fees... $130/day is held in your credit card  ($780 for us!!!) I checked into other resorts (Monte Carlo) and other establishments fees run less than $20/day.. We stayed here with 12 other guests who flew out  for our wedding, so we decided to take everyone to the buffet for our reception dinner. $35/person + gratuity. The buffet was fantastic... Everything from crab legs, salmon, prime rib, ham, Asian, Italian, and Greek. Basically anything you can think of is available. The only negative is we were told we would be seated in a separate room, and we were seated in the middle of the busy dining area. This made it impossible to have a conversation with my family.. On the day I got married I went to the concierge for 3 items: band aids, a plastic comb & a straight pin. I ended up with 2 safety pins, 1 band aid & was told housekeeping would be up with the comb. 40 minutes later my husband tracked down housekeeping and was told they have no combs.. There is no coffee maker located in our room. Nor was there a mini fridge... But you can rent a mini fridge for a small fee of $25/day. :( but there are electric open/close drapes in every room, so I guess that makes up for the fact that you will need to spend $5.88 every morning for a cup of Starbucks coffee in the Aria.. Checkout for my guests was a nightmare... Two separate rooms were told they had used the mini bar or snack tray, which was not the case. $50 a pop to open the mini bar fridge. My personal checkout incurred no additional fees, but took 15 minutes at 5:15 am. This should be a 30 second process.. I gave this hotel 3 stars based solely on their classy decor and delicious food. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO SAVE YOUR EXTRA CASH FOR A SHOW OR TWO WHILE YOURE IN VEGAS.... . SKIP THE ARIA.
With all of the "theme" hotels in Vegas, it is refreshing to see a new resort that focuses more on REAL quality and luxury than gaudy, plastic representations of the same.  I enjoyed the Sky Suites which was heaven on earth.  I felt like I was in a modern, luxurious home in the sky.  5 Star restaurants.  6 star service.  Best location on the strip.  If you are a pool/gym/spa person - look no further.  This is your place.  If you like to shop, bring your credit card as the hotel is attached to a shopping center (Crystals) which has all of the high-end retailers.
I stayed here 12/17/2013-12/23/2013. The room was very comfortable and the entire resort was clean with good customer service to be found everywhere you went.. . Gamblers may be disappointed with the odds available here but I suppose they need to keep the lights on so nothing personal. . . The in-room remote that controls everything from the TV to the curtains feels a bit dated in the age of the iPad but an easy fix to the rooms to earn a five star review would be make the room lighting capable of being not  just dim to really really dim.. . The pool area is really fantastic and has a private feel to it.
To make this long story short. . . I book the Aria 3 nights stay from 01/17 to 01/20 here at hotels.com  Hotels.com has always been wonderful, courteous and helpful every single time I have called.. . When we arrived to Aria, we used the invited guest check in because I have also M life Player's Gold card. the stay was OK. The problem came 10 minutes after we checked out.. . It was about 12:35pm when I have received an forwarded email from my coworker saying: "Lol, why you went to Vegas without telling us?" when I opened the email it has a attachment of PDF file from Aria about my stay details, which is a receipt. How in the world Aria sent my information to my coworker's work email? I used Hotels.com to book the rooms which shows my personal email xxxxxxx@gmail.com on M life account i use my other personal email xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com I have never used my work email and how did Aria email my receipt to my coworker's email?. . I asked to talk to a manager, his name is Ryan Gregory, after I explained to whole thing to him and how frustrated I was. He just did not want to help me at all, not an apology, not any kind of compensation. and When I ask him what is he gonna do for me. He said we cannot do anything and right after that he asked smiling is there anything else he can do. He was really laughing from inside right at my face. Ryan Gregory is really a piece of sxxt !!! He does not qualify to be an Assistant Manager for a 5 star hotel, in fact any hotel, any where!. . He is an insult to Aria and MGM as a company.
I absolutely love this hotel. Service, rooms, everything is exceptional. . . Last there mid December. I won't stay anywhere else.
We stayed at the Aria after years of coming to Las Vegas and always staying at the Bellagio or the Wynn. I must say you get what you pay for. The valet service was mediocre. We rented a car and my husband would pick it up and wait for us to come down and they would make him move to keep traffic free. Not the Bellagio! I asked for a microwave in tne room as I do all over the US, at first they said no. And when I stated all hotels give this service I got one. Not the Bellagio or Wynn!!. Their servers were slow and mediocre in their restaurants. It was just a hotel. Kind of like a holiday inn but with better restaurants, meaning way high priced for the hotel. I would not come back here again.
We are first class travelers .... This hotel has poor service!,low standards!!! Booked a non-smoking suite awhile ago....they checked us in to a stinky room....smelt  of smoke and then moved us to another non smoking room that stunk terrible from smoke! They said they were filled up! We left .... Rather give our $$$ to another hotel who appreciates our business! I would NEVER recommend this hotel  and NEVER go back!!!! Absolutely TERRIBLE CUSTOMER service!!!!!
Beautiful hotel, nice decor. Pros, clean, modern, nice casino. Cons, small rooms,trying to do too much in too little space, the scents they have pumping through the casino and lobby areas are nice at first, but then become overwhelming throught the day and the rest of the stay. It actually started to make me feel a little quesy sometimes, and I don't have anything close to a weak stomach! The walk from the front doors to the strip is about a half mile long! I don't think I'd stay here again, I wasn't hugely turned off by it or anything, I  just wasn't very impressed. But then again, this is back when it first opened and everyone was making such a huge deal about the newly built city center. It was just Meh in my book.
I don't know why I was not expecting this hotel to be great.  I expected to over pay and under deliver.  We decided our group was going to stay in City Center this year and we chose Aria.  Because of the recent linking of Hyatt & the MGM properties, my Hyatt Platinum status gave me gold status in M-Life which resulted in a better deal than just off the website.  . . We chose the lowest level 2 bed queen.  The room had an amazing view of the strip.  We were only on the 10th floor, but we really had a great view.  The window was extremely large and gave us a very picturesque view. The motorized 2 level curtains were a nice touch too.. . The beds were so extremely comfortable.  Everyone in my group stated how they need one of those at home because they all slept so well.  . . Had some minor complaints about the room. The remote was terrible. Felt like it was not working (checked the batteries and they were good).  The bathtub behind the shower combo was really weird (wish I had taken a picture, but if you get a room there you will know what I mean).  These were nothing big.. . The toiletries provided were very nicely scented and of high quality.. . The casino is nice.  Not my favorite casino, but a good one.  . . . The gym was awesome.  I have worked out in multiple of the higher end Vegas hotels and this by far is my favorite one so far.  Plenty of free weights, weight machines, & cardio machines.  I only wish I could have worked out more.  You might as well use it because they are forcing you to pay for it with the $25 + tax/night charge they sneak in after they give you how much your room total is after tax.  Don't get this added to your tab until you check in so keep this in mind (I think it is a little sneaky). . I will definitely stay here again.
Great Casino modern and LEED design excellent.. I left my Versace Jacket at Five 50 on Friday.  I went back today they called lost and found.  The manager came out and stated they found 2 brought them up for me to view and one was mine!!! . These guys are professional and efficient thank you Aria
Beautiful Hotel, though a little disappointing for the scarce amount of people there. :-/
not a 4 or 5 star hotel. perhaps by vegas standards but not in reality. maybe by conference standards. . no doorman available, valet is in the middle of a 6 lane circle drive with no bellhops. and to check in you get in line like at six flags. don't expect four seasons, mandarin or ritz standards.
