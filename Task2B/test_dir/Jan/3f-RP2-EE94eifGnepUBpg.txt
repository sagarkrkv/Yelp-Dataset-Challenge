Definitely one of the best experiences of my life. I would go to this show again and again.. I am a Beatles fan and I was mesmerized.. I had seen Ka before this and knew that Cirque was capable of greatness, but with Love, they just took things to a new level.. Hats off!
Great show. From all Cirque Du Soleil's, this one is definitely the most colorful, fun & crazy. Saw it twice, loved it better at the second time.
Roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour!  The plot for the entire performance was fairly close to none, but they did try to bring to life the characters of some of the songs that were played.  From Eleanor Rigby to Fr. McKenzie to Lucy to Jude to Mr. Kite to Julia to Sgt. Pepper...  Then there's the Octopus's Garden, too.  "Oh what joy for every girl and boy!". . The show was relatively short at about 1:30, but it was enjoyable nevertheless.  For me, this was more of a celebration of the music of the Beatles rather than the colorfully clad acrobats doing their act.  Several tracks were remixed and mashed up and as a fan of their music, I could say that I found them refreshing.. . The vignettes about the Fab Four were absolutely cool.  I thought they could have used more of those and maybe stretch out the show to about 2 hours.  Not to mention the numerous Beatles songs to choose from.  Overall, there seemed to be some misses here and there, "but it all works out; It doesn't matter much to me...  Strawberry fields forever..."
I liked the experience but amidst the performance the show came to a halt. The ushers informed us that it was some type of safety mechanism that stops the performance to prevent a mishap. With that said, this whole issue that lasted a good 30 mins brought the overall review down a peg or two.
Let me start by saying this was a fun show with great music.  It helps that I'm a Beatles fan.  I had to refrain from singing along (since I knew all the songs).. . This is the second Cirque-like show I've seen.  The first was Le Reve (we lucked into free tickets).  I have since learned Le Reve wasn't a Cirque show, but it definitely is Cirque-like.  So while I wouldn't classify myself as an aficionado, I do have a basis for comparison.  As my rating indicates, the show was OK.  It was enjoyable.  It was fun.  But it wasn't great.. . First, the athleticism I saw in Le Reve was mostly missing from this show.  There was some acrobatics, but not nearly as much as I expected.  And on several occasions the action was almost frenetic.  It was difficult to focus on the performances because there was too much going on.  Le Reve did not suffer this problem.. . Second, the story wasn't as clear as Le Reve.  It seemed almost like a lot of random stunts and tricks without much purpose.  Le Reve I could see the story they were telling.  I know the story of Sgt Pepper, but it was still hard to follow the story in this show.. . So, even though I am a huge Beatles fan, I would recommend Le Reve before I would recommend this show.  The story was easier to follow, the show was more visually interesting, and the acrobatics were more impressive.  Only the music was better in this show, but if you already have the CDs you can listen to the music at home.
Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.
I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. It was seriously mind blowing and not to sound too dramatic, but it was almost life changing. This show was gorgeous and absolutely spectacular. If you do anything at all in Vegas, make sure it is this-- you will not regret it!
Just incredible.  We missed the show last year and had friends tell us it was amazing and not to miss.  We had guests ranging from 26 - 71 and we all loved it.  Breathtaking!!!
Loved Loved Loved this show. If you are a Beatles fan it is a must see. Their isn't much of a story but rather it is a great visualization to go along with some of the best Beatles songs, and the performers were amazing. It's a small theater setting which gives it an intimate feel. My only complaint is I wish I had time to see it again.
I've been to Vegas more times than I can count, but I had still never seen a Vegas show. Probably because I was too cheap. But I was determined to see one this time, but I had to make it a good one. After reading tons of reviews, I decided this was the Cirque show to see. I didn't walk in as a huge Beatles fan, but I think I might be one now! . . The show was incredible. After the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. It was so polished and beautiful. The music had a nice flow and was mixed very well. Also, the pacing was excellent. I had heard that O had dull parts, which I wanted to avoid. This one had very few breaks in the action. There were so many things to watch that I couldn't possibly see everything. I chose C section seats as some of the reviews suggested, and they were a perfect view of the action. To be clear, this wasn't about a major storyline. There were some interesting recurring characters. But to me, it had themes of unrequited love, fighting against unjust authority, celebrating individuality, and embracing and loving your fellow man.. . Now I want to go back to this show every time I'm in Vegas. I can't really think of a higher compliment.
The performers are very good at what they do, and I appreciate and applaud their talents and hardwork. The four young men in the show were adorable. . . The poor rating is because Love is not like the Cirque shows I have come to expect. Love has minimal acrobatics and a confused/mish-mosh story line. I feel completely mislead thinking I was attending a Cirque show. . . Please see Love only if you truly are a fan of the Beatles (so you can sing along and forget what type of show you are supposed to be attending)
For a child of the 60s and a huge Beatles fan, this was quite possibly the greatest gift to myself I have ever received.. This is a must see for anyone not just a Beatles fan. It was a visual eyegasm. This is not your normal Cirque show where people are doing all sorts of goofy things that could kill the mere mortal, it was a combination of interpretive dance and things that you will never be able to do. It is about the music, which is like you never heard it before. I have been clean and sober for 8 years now, and it's the first time in a long time I thought to myself, this would be awesome stoned. Sober or stoned, it was awesome.. It has a great storyline which is easy to follow if you have half a brain. It's the story of the Beatles and us. If you don't know the Beatles story you are either too young, meaning 6 years old or less, or too stupid. This was so much fun, and it solidifies that the Beatles were the greatest musical group ever that changed the world. Will go back again with different people so they can LOVE LOVE as much as I did.
I'm not one who worships everything Cirque du Soleil does but I did enjoy this show. I like the Beatles and enjoyed this show. If you're not a Beatles fan and don't like their music I'm not sure how much you'd enjoy the show. This show doesn't so much have a real plot as it is more Beatles music with different stunts, performances, etc so don't get too hung up on trying to follow the plot. I sat near the top of the round theater and from what I could tell those seats might let you see the entire stage better than the more expensive seats. Hopefully you're enjoying the show since if not the seats are so comfortable you could probably fall asleep.. . I was able to get 2 for 1 tickets through My Vegas which made it even better. I'm not sure if it's worth $120 each but I enjoyed the show and would recommend it, especially if you get discount tickets.
Huge Beatles fan here so maybe it was the years of built up anticipation of combining the awe of Cirque with the greatest group of all time that lead to a 3-star rating. . . The yelpers who said the show lacked the "wow factor" hit it right on the head. 90% of the show seemed like the level of choreography a high school could put on with a heightened costume budget.  . . After seeing 5 other cirque shows, this one let me down. I noticed a lot of the 5 star reviews came from people who had yet to see a cirque show and this was their first.
"All You Need Is Love." - John Lennon. . Mirage spending a lot marketing this show; you can see a huge Beatle Love Logo from their Hotel.  After all, they invest like 100 millions in innovation the stage.  These stages used to be the iconic Siegfried & Roy Magic show with the white lions and tigers.   One of the big cost of the new stage is in fact all 2,000 seat have an individual speakers placed in the back.  That feature help bring the sound balance in all seats.  In addition, the stage can be open and close just like other Cirque du Soleil, except no water in this one.  However, a lot of perfume foggy effect, and many high-tech lighting systems.. . The entrance to the show was nicely done; it felt like you walk to an upscale nightclub.  The show is a lot more about the music, is really the heart and souls of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobat performers.  Performer of all ages were part of the show, some stunts does not look like it had any safety strap despite been like over 100 feet in the air.  The best act I think was the Come Together, that act was flawless it requireperfect timing between several performer. That song was a great fit of the act.  Not every act was excellent, but there more than a few dozen would wow you.. . This is my first time watching Cirque Du Soleli, and I am definite a fan of them.  Looking forward to see the famous water show like O and Le Reve.  I basically got this show for free view the special hotel reservation promotion.  The shows tickets value were higher than our hotel stay in the Monte Carlo.  At top of that, our seat were been upgrade from balcony to second row !
Omg this show is incredible... Amazing choreography music and all around fun... Then i got a backstage tour what an amazing night...
I don't want to write a lengthy review, as there are a million of those already.. . Hubbie and I have seen all the Cirque show, but weren't interested in this, as I don't care for Beatles music. I know, I know, cut me some slack, lol. But I kept hearing that this show was the best Cirque show. So we finally went. . . And everyone was right. This was by far the BEST Cirque show there is. . . Just one word of caution. If you are LEAST bit sensitive to weird lights or prone to seizures don't go to a Cirque show.  I had to keep closing my eyes because of the blinking lights. I just know to do this, so it didn't diminish my experience much. . . I can't even begin to tell you how much in awe I was of the mechanicals of this show and the engineering it must have taken to get this show running. Kudos to the designers and engineers behind the scenes as the incredible performers often get the only acknowledgment. . . The ONLY negative I have is the cattle call to get in the theater. You would think there would be a better way of getting 2000 people into the theater than just everyone standing around, and then the theater opening and having people cut in line, or jump in front of those that have been respectfully standing in line.  But I think that's just rude people overall.
