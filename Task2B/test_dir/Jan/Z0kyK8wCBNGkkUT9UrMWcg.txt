The filet mignon was INCREDIBLE.  Perfectly prepared, perfectly served.  Loved every second and would say it's one of the better steaks I've had.  The sides were all delicious, but stay away from the gratin.  It's not really gratin, but a bunch of potato chunks thrown in cheese.  Overall, great service and great food.  Definitely must do again!
I thought I had experienced a good cut of meat until I went here.  . . I'm not big on atmosphere but if I'm going to pay for a nice meal, then it matters.  This place has a perfect old-school leather and wood boardroom feel.  The menu is simple- steak, seafood and sides.  No trendy fusion fare with unicorn horn or rainbow dust.  This place simply serves the best meats with best ingredients and meticulous preparation.  The sides were basic but tasty and perfectly complimented the entre.  . . Yes, it's a franchise but it's a damn good one.  It's not cheap however the quality and service make it worthwhile.  The only problem is that it practically ruined me for other steak houses.  . . Simply great steak.  Correction: simply excellent steak.

Worth every single penny. This is easily the best steak house I've been to in the country. There are a few things you get here (besides the obvious steak):. . 1. VIP Martini. I never order martini's at dinner, but this is something special. It's made from soaking pineapple's in vodka for 8-10 days. It's delicious and can sneak up on you. . . 2. Lobster Mac. . . 3. Onion rings. They are giant and tasty.. . 4. Lemon cake for dessert.
My last meal would be from Del Frisco's.  My first experience was with the Del Frisco's in Orlando.  When I found out that there was a Del Frisco's a little closer to home (closer as in Las Vegas is only 270 miles away from SoCal), I was ecstatic.  The food and service is unparalleled.  It's an upscale, expensive steakhouse, but soooooo worth it.... over and over again.  I'd go there just for the bread!  I request some bread to take home at the end of the meal.  I treated my family to an extravagant dinner here (mostly because I wanted to go).  . . We went in for an early dinner because we had slightly unpredictable 3- and 5-year old boys with us, so we didn't want to go when it was busy.  The waitstaff was extremely hospitable and went out of their way to cater to all of us.  I was blown away that they didn't mind the kids making a bit of a mess and running around getting in their way.  In fact, the staff was more amazed that my nephews figured out some of the silverware was magnetized!  A fun distraction for the kids.  I think the staff quickly printed out some pictures for the kids to color when they saw us sit down.. . Back to the food.... amazing, heavenly, mouth-watering.  The steak is the best I've ever had, and I'm a steak kind of gal.  Sides are usually ordered separately, but the prix fixe menu was very convenient.  Del Frisco's is hands down, my favorite restaurant.
I can say nothing that hasn't already been said. Wow. Best steakhouse ever. Just making sure thy get the stars they deserve    For food and service.
Steak Haus abseits des las vegas Strip.. Sehr gro, auch ohne Reservierung einen Platz brkommen.. High Class, bisschen unterkuhlte Atmosphare, bisserl snobby.. Steak war ein Tomahawk Steak, Medium rare. Bei der Anlieferung des Steak wird man aufgefordert, das Steak mittig zu halbieren oder anzuschneiden, um sicherzustellen, dass es richtig gegrillt wurde. Das habe ich abgelehnt, weil ich das schone Stuck nicht in Eile zerstoren wollte, nur damit der Steak Anlieferer seine auswendig gelernten Tasks erfullt... Er schaute mich zwar entsetzt an, aber verschwand dann schnell.. . Das Steak selbst war ok, nicht uberwaltigend, etwas viel fett an den Randern. Medium Rare wie bestellt, allerdings innen etwas zu kalte Kerntemperatur. Ebenso die Beilage, Creme Spinach, schon kalt bei der Anlieferung.. . Preise sehr gehoben und alles in allem fur die genannten Punkte zu hoch. Aber solide Qualitat.
When we entered we were greeted by a whiff of a backed up septic system which lingered throughout the evening . We were early but they still made us wait even though there were 20 empty tables. The service was good. . The steaks were ok but not at all worth the price they were asking for . The sides were small and the whole experience was cheapened by giving us forms to fill out about our dinner. . The atmosphere might have been ok except for the horrible smell. I will not return
Very nice place, staff very friendly, service was great enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere, will be back.
I have to say I was impressed. I have grown accustomed to high end steak places and it takes something to really get my attention. This place is now tops on my list of spots for steak in Vegas. We had the filet, lobster, spinach, lobster mac and cheese, and mushrooms. Every dish was excellent and the steak was perfectly prepared and flavored. The service was excellent and I have no complaints at all (rare!).. . I will be back to work my way through the menu.. . Try the speciality Pineapple infused vodka. Wow.. absolutly perfect drink.
Great food, great service.  Rib-eye medium rare done perfectly.  Sides - lobster mac and cheese, asparagus and scalloped potatoes - all excellent.  The crab cake appetizer is a great way to start off the meal.
As good as you could ever expect! Osters, Bread, Steak, Crabcakes, Mac & Cheese..Check., 4 of us left there will full belly's and not a morsel left on a plate! Great solid drinks from the bar as well. This is not your Hotel/ Casino Steakhouse. True pride and perfection when it comes to service and food quality!
Horrible food   Service was ok but to our shock the food was horrible
My boyfriend and I ate here at his company Christmas Party. The company had reserved a good sized private room that comfortably fit a party of about 50-60 people. The interior of the room was elegantly rustic and dimly lit. (but not dark). . There were about 3-4 different waiters/waitresses that were serving appetizers that I had to physically stop myself from eating an outrageous amount of because they were just THAT good. . . Coconut Shrimp- Succulent, sweet, just the right amount of coconut and not at all greasy. They were served with a sweet/tangy sauce that had already been drizzled atop each shrimp. The sauce was not overwhelming and it perfectly balanced the savory notes of each bite. . . Bruschetta- I only had one of these because I found them a little difficult to eat. The tomatoes kept falling off and because I had my wine glass in the other hand, it made it that much more difficult to catch the falling food. Other than the difficulty (yes, i could have put my wine glass down.... but who the heck does that?) they were a flavor explosion in my mouth. The garlic added a bit of a kick and the balsamic vinegar had the perfect amount of sweetness that balanced out the whole thing. . . Vegetable quesadillas- these were good, but nothing that I can't make at home. I remember them having onions and peppers. But that's it.. . Mini Crab Cakes- I probably could have eaten like 17 of these but because I was at a company Christmas Party, I had to painfully hold myself back. I have had terrible crab cakes that had more breading than crab and I can honestly tell you that these are the EXACT opposite. The crab was so sweet and thankfully didn't have any hint of ocean water to them. They were seasoned perfectly and seared just right. . . The main course that I chose was the tuna steak. It was served with brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The tuna was covered in different seasonings (couldn't really tell what types) that included black sesame seeds. The center was still red, the fish was VERY fresh and had a very clean and crisp taste to it. The mashed potatoes were velvety and garlic-y and the brussels sprouts were sauteed with butter and had little chunks of bacon throughout. I had a bite of my bf's filet mignon and that too was very delicious. He ordered his medium and I just remembered it melting in my mouth.. . For dessert I chose the bread pudding and my bf ordered a chocolate mousse cake. Usually my tastebuds would have favored the chocolate dessert but the bread pudding was soooooooo delicious. It was hot, cinnamon-y, and it literally disintegrated in my mouth. It was topped with vanilla ice cream which sealed the deal. I had a bite of the chocolate mousse cake and although it was delicious, the bread pudding reigns supreme. . . Although we didn't pay for a single thing at our visit, we would not hesitate to come here on our own. The service was impeccable (they literally served us our meal) and the food was over-the-top delicious.
I have severe allergies to gluten and corn. I was pleased when they had a gluten free menu. This turned out to be false advertising however as they clearly knew nothing about cross contamination. I ended up with hours of horrific stomach cramps, and that was the nice part of purging their bad food. Furthermore, the steak was $90. I am used to high prices and good service. In fact, I go to expensive places BECAUSE I have special needs. It really turns me off to pay top dollar and to have full assurances, and then to get so horribly sick. I fed the rest of that expensive steak to my dog. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere.
Love this steakhouse! Def have better steak than most of the restaurants on the strip or inside the hotels/casinos. The steaks were always juicy and melt in your mouth (we always get the bone in ribeye). The steaks are similar to Ruth's Chris' but tasted a little better. Their lobster mac and cheese was only ok--not very memorable to me. Their sesame bread was delicious. We always go to town on those bread with butter. Even asked for seconds--and they never mind. Service is top notch here. . . Definitely check this place out if you're a steak lover! My BF and I always try to fit this place on our itinerary whenever we're in Vegas!
Obviously the Double Eagle has figured out a way to write hundreds of fake Yelp reviews. But their scam worked flawlessly and they got their six Benjamins out of me. I've been to scores of other amazing steakhouses in Vegas and there is absolutely no way on earth that this one could be legitimately rated so high. No way. Nope. Not a chance. Never.
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.  My steak (Bone In Ribeye, medium rare) was cooked to perfection, the flavor was spectacular.   One of the others in the party got the Filet, which truly melted in your mouth.  I offered a bit of a swap for the tuna, which had an amazing ginger and wasabi spread that was not too strong, but really fit the flavor of the tuna.  The service was amazing, they were so quick with anything, and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone, ever.  If you have the chance, go to Del Frisco's.
It is fancy restaurant! . . one of my friends from texas promised me to take most fancy restaurant in texas and i look it up online and i found out it is also in las vegas as well!! . . So i went there for my anniversary with my boy friend.  We ordered one bottle of wine, fried calamary,  and two steak. . our meal was not pricey but i recommend to order special menu which is pricey but it would be more better~
Del-icious. Double Eagle...why not Triple Eagle. I have buddy who's Indian name is Triple Eagle...honest truth.
