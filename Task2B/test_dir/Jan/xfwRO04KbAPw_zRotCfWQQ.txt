First...know there are/were 3 locations. Not familiar with Vegas, we ended up at the M Hotel specifically to eat at the Hash House...of course it had closed 2 days prior...you'd think they'd update their website. So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name. . . We were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok. The potatoes on it were amazing. I ordered a bacon waffle which was a sad sad waffle indeed. Not very flavorful...compare to something you'd get at Denny's or norms. :-/ . . Portions are enormous. I'd rather have a smaller portion if higher quality food. Won't be back.
Giant Food.  Be ready to share.  The chicken and waffles were decent and I would eat it again.
Huge portion dishes.  We tried the chicken & waffle and couple other dishes.  They only use chicken breastmeat, which I found a bit bland.  The juice was ok, but I doubt it's fresh squeezed.  I can't say the food here blow me away, but the portion did blow up my stomach and food coma inducing.  Well, it's a vegas experience I am not incline to have too often. . . Ok, so it's a bit of waiting on weekend noontime.  We had to walk around to kill time but ended up came back really too late.  However there wasn't too many people waiting and we were able to get the table quickly.
We first found out about this place from Man vs Food:. . Location is great. It's a few miles away from the strip so getting there doesn't take too long (no traffic). . . The wait to get in was fair considering the popularity of the restaurant. For 2, we waited about 12-15 minutes.. . The environment was enjoyable; the music was in good taste (indie/alternative rock), the customer service was enthusiastic, and the walls were filled with celebrity-signed menus.. . The food was amazing! The portions were behemoth and one plate is more than enough for two people. The alcoholic drinks are served in quirky slanted cups and they can be taken home as a souvenir. . . Overall this was an awesome first experience!
Hash House A Go Go is the place we bring all of our out-of-town guests. The staff is always friendly and attentive and the food is amazing! . . The niche this restaurant has is fresh food in huge portions for a reasonable price. I always order the hot chocolate because it comes in a soup bowl with a monster marshmallow. The pancakes hardly fit on the plate and the biscuits are to die for! . . One Saturday we stopped in and there was a theme "Robot Love" and all the staff had homemade costumes! It was a fun and comfortable atmosphere. . . Try the Sage Chicken & Waffles, it's what they're know for from Man vs Food. You'll never forget it!
The Sage fried chicken is the business! The portions are wonderful and even my kids love it there ...the wait at the location on the strip was a bit much...However the wait at the M resort is not bad at all!
Hash House A Go Go is almost an institution, but my experience was just alright. Of course, on a weekend, the wait time for a table is pretty long (about 30 minutes), which I expected. Once we got seated, I expected things to go a bit more smoothly, but unfortunately, it was not to be.  My friend got her food about 10 minutes before mine came out, so hers got cold because she didn't want to start eating before me.. . The portions are large, but the food was pretty bland. I had the pecan blueberry pancake, eggs and sausage combination. I got one tiny container of syrup for my monster sized pancake, and there definitely wasn't any warmth to the service- it was obviously "get em in and out ASAP" as the mantra. Oh well....
Loved the food portions. Just make sure to come when hungry. Prices were very reasonable and service was great. Every time I requested something, the waiter was quick and happy to fetch!
If you haven't heard... This is pretty much the BEST breakfast place, EVER! And the portions is unbeatable. I can eat A LOT, but usually I don't finish my whole plate here, so sharing is an option. They may charge for that though. My friend said they charged her last time for sharing. Everything I've ever had here has been good. I recommend the vanilla waffles for sure! The chicken and waffles are awesome and HUGE! Also, any hash skillet or scramble is good.... What can I say. Pretty much anything made from here is ridiculously yummy! I'm a breakfast person. I can eat breakfast anytime of day. ENJOY!
This place is the very definition of a gut-buster. . . Portions are so huge, it's ridiculous. There's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. Even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. I was drawn here because of Man V. Food, and ended up ordering the dish that Adam made famous: it's advertised as a "farm benedict," but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of mashed potatoes? In addition to sage fried chicken, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? This thing isn't a benedict, it's a HOUSE! A very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. I have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. My wife ordered the riddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. Like I said, this place thrives on excess! The french toast was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. It all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. Again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. Because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. . . You've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called O'Hare Of The Dog: a 24 oz Budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.. . Classy? Nope. But fun? Absolutely. . . No matter how hungry you are, you will leave Hash House A Go Go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life. . . And the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...
After reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. I had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. When looking at the picture this place for me seem like "comfort food" with a twist. When we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. The hostess quickly seated us. The menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. Our server according to our receipt was Jay. He quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. Our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. For Hash House A Go Go "big portions" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. . . Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first  is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. The presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).. . Highly Recommend the Kokokmo and Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs. So if you are planning to eat here Get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!
Hash House A Go Go was better last time.  I guess they gotten more popular that it's not the same. Super busy today... They even charge for extra sauce unlike before it was free. Food was okay. Some food was dry... Like the chicken and french toast. Doesn't have good flavor. Fruit was over ripe... Didn't get our water refill... Wouldn't recommend whenthere a lot of people waiting around...
By far the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The restaurant is crazy and typically has a wait but it's worth it.
If you are looking for large portion sizes, look no further than Hash House A Go Go.. . I usually come to this restaurant when I need my fix of chicken and waffles. I am a huge fan of Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles in Southern California, and this restaurant gives me a placebo for Roscoe's when I need it.. . I have also tried the popular dish that was featured on Man vs. Food (I forget the name). Again, I enjoyed it, but it was not anything special either.. . During busy times, the line to get a seat can be VERY long. Plan ahead of time or prepare to wait (sometimes outside).. . Don't go out of your way to try this restaurant, but it is worth a look if you're in the area and you'd like to get very, very full.
Add me to chorus of positive reviews, you really can't go wrong with this place. . . I'm not a pig, but I get frustrated when you pay good money at a restaurant and you leave hungry. This will never happen to you here. The portions are huge, you always have a doggie bag, and they make your favorite menu item so well that you'll find it hard to try some of the other menu items (but you should, I have yet to try anything here that isn't first rate). the Roasted Chicken hashis my favorite (for the moment).. . One thing I particularly enjoy about HHAGG is the excellent micro-brew choices they have. It's not a massive list, but it's an excellent, rotating list, and it complements a lot of the meals really well. . .  There is always a wait at this place, so plan accordingly. But you know when you see a big line in front of any restaurant, it's usually for the right reasons, and that is certainly true of HHAGG.
This may be the single greatest restaurant you will ever go to. The original is in San Diego in Hilcrest and unlike most Las Vegas versions of good restaurants from other places (cough canters cough) this one is true to the original; and the original is amazing. No f-ing joke, if i lived in Hilcrest I would weigh no less that 465lbs because of the Hash House. If you love breakfast, you will love this place. No question in my mind. I've been to both a combined maybe 15 times and never had anything less that great. If they have the pork tenderloin hash, get that. Its ridiculous.You will love it forever.
Here's my video review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2ZbNhpRyc&list=UUQ4ESoV0goB3YZAHiZ69yhA. . If you're ever in Vegas in search of a good breakfast spot, check out Hash house a go go!  Preferably, the one on West Sahara Avenue because it is the cleanest one in Vegas thus far.  [The Quad hotel is kinda dirty, so I don't recommend that one, but the restaurant there looked clean, although there were not too many customers]. . Review by: Denyce@Hairdresser.net
This place is great.  I first fell in love with it at the M-Casino; but that location closed.  I checked out the Plaza Hotel location and it did not live up to the same standards.  It's okay, you should find out for yourself.  They give you a lot of food and have a fun menu.  They have HUGE pancakes and tasty dishes.  I'd check it out again for sure.  Too bad the M-Resort location closed.  I prefer that over downtown; as downtown has drawn a more... how do I put this, ghetto crowd.  Just my two cents.
Great big breakfast!  More than I could eat. I had the hash with chorizo and it was great. My breakfast mates had egg scramble and basic and enjoyed both . . The homemade tangerine jam was excellent to put on my giant biscuit.
Awesomeness.  Pure Awesomness.
Among the worst restaurants I have ever had the misfortune to patronize.   After suffering through a miserable meal -- bad service, bad food, bad attitudes --  at the now-closed location at the M Resort, I said I would never go back.  But while in Reno,, staying at Harrah's Reno, I unhappily noticed that the hotel has almost no other choices, so I tried the Hash House there.  Yuck!  Ugly, multi-tattooed servers, slow service, marginally edible food.  I will be glad when this sorry establishment goes out of business.
Awesome food in ridiculously ginormous portions.
LOVE LOVE! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here every chance I get. The food was soo good and the servers were really nice and personable. We went for dinner and were surprised at the huge portions! We heard about the pancakes the size of your head which I hate we didnt stay long enough in Vegas to try their breakfast. One of the best meals I've had in a while.
Hash House A Go Go is one of my favorite establishments for monstrous sized breakfast dishes.  The place is actually great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner so you can't go wrong by choosing Hash House a Go Go. Growing up in San Diego, I have gone to the Hash House there more times than I can recall, so going out of the way (off the strip) to grab grub at Hash House was an obvious choice away from the buffets and rest of the crowds. The food at this location was great and each of us had enough leftovers to serve as a late night snack.  For whatever reason, the BLT Blood Mary here was far superior to any other of the BLT Blood Marys that I have had at other places.  Looking forward to going back!
Delicious (and HUGE) breakfast. Had a nice selection of hearty breakfasts. I recommend sharing any of the benedicts.
MY MY MY....The chicken & waffles pass them up and your an idiot lol. THEY WERE SOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Sweet and yummy. Beautiful and unique display of yummy delicious food. I love this place and when I go back to Las Vegas its a must that I stop by. They food is like art....and they give you so much of it. Hands down one of my fav places to eat. Try the chicken & waffles!
Sage Fried Chicken breakfast is amazing!. . I went to this spot specifically from the reviews of Yelp, boy, it did not disappoint.. . Price - Very reasonable, my giant fried chicken breakfast was only $12 with a biscuit, two eggs, two bacons, mash potatoes, and fruit. . . Wait - Wasn't very long, took us 10 minutes to get a table for 2 at noon on a Sunday.. . Selection - there was so many options on the menu varying from all different types of dishes for the right occasion.. . Very impressed, thank you Yelp.
I was expecting more. The service and the food was bleh.. I rather go to SkinnyFats in Las Vegas
Yes sir, we will be back!  Thank you fellow Yelpers for all of your feedback, we certainly were not disappointed. When you said hefty portions, we did heed your advice. . . We made a reservation and was able to get seated right away, we came as a group of 7, not a real issue, our food came pretty much right away. Believe me, we came hungry & left very happy with leftovers! . . I'm taking a star off because of the server we had, she seemed to be distracted, or maybe didn't want to serve us? We tipped her well anyway.  Hopefully, she'll be nicer to her customers in the future?
Enormous portion sizes, and waffles are BOMB too!
I love this place! Always great food and great service. The portions are huge and so delicious. I have never had a bad meal at Hash House. I love their pancakes with coconut and mango. My husband loves the Benedict with sage chicken. We have been to several locations in Las Vegas and have never had a bad meal.
Ok let me say that I was here over a month ago but wanted to still write a review. Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes of more for a table. This place is extremely popular and it does get packed. My friends and I waited a long time before we were seated which was understandable. All the eats are close together and there is outside seating available. It does get noisy so I would not recommend thisplace if you are looking for a more intimate setting..    I ordered the maple reduction chicken and when it came out I was not expecting how huge the portions would be! Honestly my plate alone was large enough to feed two people! It came with a homemade biscuit and a side of mashed potatoes all of which were delicious. One of my friends ordered the pancakes which was enormous! The prices are very fair considering the extremely large portions. I hear there is a location in San Diego also which I will visit soon!
I walked in today around 1pm as a solo diner and even though slightly larger parties of 2 or 3 were waiting I was seated immediately.   Service was fast, efficient and informative.   The menu is an interesting mix of fresh,  flavorful and a touch of hedonism.   The open ceiling combined with the wood floors and abundance of stainless steel can make it noisy but on this visit nit overly so.. I had a fresh made cherry limeade that was the right combination of sweet and tart.  The waiter also informed me that refills were not free which I appreciated.  The chicken and waffles taste-wise were excellent.   The waffles had full strips of cooked bacon in them and coming out the edges.   The presentation was overwhelming and most likely needs to be served on a larger plate as there is no way to eat this dish without the garnish and chicken sliding off the plate but somehow I managed.   The rosemary sprig speared into both pieces of fried chicken gives the meat a subtle piney taste that complements the sage very well.. . Like all the other customers today I too walked out with my doggie bag as the quantity is just too much to eat in one sitting.   It is this last point that prevents me from giving 5 stars.  Please don't misunderstand.  I enjoyed my experience and will return.   I recommend you try this restaurant with a unique concept.
At first I thought I would be impressed by this place because everything smelled delicious and portions going around were enormous!. . First bite wasn't what I expected.... There was nothing special about their food .. Everything was garnished the same and everything tasted the same.. . I gave it another shot because boss brought it for lunch ... And I just wasn't convinced... I'm sorry but I just can't seem to like this place..
Harsh. This is the best word we could come up with to describe Hash House. Just call it Harsh House.. . We wandered here while waiting for our car to be serviced at AutoNation. 11am on a Saturday there was a line out the door. It smelled promising. We were seated in less than 10 and our waiter appeared in under a minute. Coffee and waters were back in less than 2 minutes. They place was packed so the service really is excellent. The food, eh. . . The music is loud, and harsh and abrasive. The decor is harsh; I get they're going for a certain look, but it's not very comfortable. The food is, well, harsh. The spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. It was weird. I wanted to say I liked my giant heaping portions of salmon eggs benedict with weird plastic cheese sauce, but I couldn't. They were too... harsh. . . If I were a tourist completely hungover from a night of debauchery on the strip and my tastebuds were fried from cigarettes I might like this place. But we won't ever eat here again.
Get off the strip, and get into something great! . . Hash House A Go Go is a fun place with giant size breakfast plates big enough for sharing. . . Food is good with lots of fun combos to choose fr.
I'm in love with the snickers pancake, must try. Portions big, at a great price and good service.
The food was delicious!!  I've been there a few times already.  Big portions.  I suggest either sharing with someone or eating it the next day.  I'm greedy, I had no desire to share :). Eating as leftover was delicious.
We've been here several times, overall it's a great concept, but lately it's just turning into another tourist trap in Vegas. Noisy, crowded and the food doesn't make up for it. Soggy limp waffle, runny undercooked eggs and rush service. 10 minute wait between visits from the server who mostly acted like she needed us to leave so she get another 4 top in. Used to be great, but better stuff to be had without the wait.  Good Bloody Mary's though! But pass if you want good food.
I was a fool to expect much from a run down place like this...goes to show how much TV  publicity can superficially boost a restaurant's reputation...I ordered a mushroom hash and much to my chagrin it was just a Denny's entree but in a fancier skillet.  The service was fast but water seems to be scarce here as not one refill happened and the food only takes about half an hour to come out...for supposedly fast food.  Now the dish that they're famous for...the chicken that the man vs food ate, its just some super decked out chicken jam packed with every unhealthy food and fatty flavor possible.  Now if you like that then you're in heaven and if not then you're stuck trying to shove lard down your throat.
This place has big "pretty" portions, but something about most of the dishes lacks flavor!  I'm giving Hash House 4 out of 5 stars because I have always had good experiences here, even though a few of the dishes are bland.  The Sage Chicken and Waffles is my favorite dish here.  My family came in town and decided to get the pot-pie, and the salmon dinner, they both complained that their dish was bland, not living up to the initial hype.
I'm from the east coast. It's my second time visiting Vegas. Love the atmosphere. I had to come try this spot because I saw it on the food network. Gotta say the portions were really large so I got every bang for my buck. Overall I would say it was a good experience. I had the chicken and waffles and it was stacked. I'd recommend this to any hungry men
I was taken to Hash House A Go Go with a major fan and was expecting so much better. The portions are huge and if portion over taste was my thing, I would have loved it. I orered the Sage Chicken Benedict and in theory it sounds delicious and even has a Man vs. Food endorsement, but it was gross. It should have been called the trash plate or the left over plate because it seemed like something you'd make when all of the left overs from the week came together in one dish. The biscuits here are the worst biscuits ever made as they aren't flakey or buttery but big dough blobs. There were too many flavors on the plate and at the end I just felt sick. I am not a huge fan of mash potatoes to begin with but mashed potatoes under chicken, biscuits, eggs, cheese, and this sauce was just too much. Oh, and the food was not hot at all just slightly warm leftovers on a huge plate.... . I did taste my friend's banana pancakes and they were delicious, but everyone else's food was just meh.
First time eating here and in my opinion, I  thought it was alright, nothing great. . Service was very good, I must say. We started with complimentary biscuits drizzled with honey and butter.. We ordered the 'All' blue crab cake entree, Butternut squash w/sundried tomato and mushroom risotto and the Pub crawl corned beef sandwich. Everything had good flavor except that the "All" blue crab cake was mostly breadcrumb  filler and not crab. I sent it back and ordered the stuffed meatloaf, which again was alright. The portions for everything are huge. . I will try them again just because the service was really good and maybe next time I'll get lucky and order something here worth raving about, but not anytime soon.
