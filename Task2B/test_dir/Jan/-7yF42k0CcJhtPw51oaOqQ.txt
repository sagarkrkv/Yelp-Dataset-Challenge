Still a nice property to visit. The gardens never disappoint. The fountain show is still great. Every visitor that I host always enjoys the Bellagio stop.
Room so dirty . Dead flies, left over peanuts on the carpet, used tissues behind the head board (someone probably wiped there sperm after sex) and thick dust covering the carpet. I took a video of it. After 3 managers 2 housekeeping supervisor and 1 concierge with 5 vacuums later I got the room cleaned. I'm not a white person so I couldn't get the room comped. I had the "sorry " treatment. This place is really for white people to get anything done.
4:10 PM - room 1 - high-pitched whirring noise in ceiling, thought I could call to get it fixed. 4:30 PM - after 20 minutes of phone hold, sent to another room where my key would work and security would be there in five minutes to let us in. . 5:00 Pm - after 10 minutes in the hallway waiting for security because the cards didn't actually work, and 20 minutes on hold with the front desk asking for security, we learn that room 2 was smoked in, so no go for us non-smokers. When the front desk was informed that someone had smoked in the room, they reacted with disbelief. 5:20 PM - front desk guy says he'll waive $80 in fees, and give us what he says is a slightly nicer room. When I said this was pretty poor compensation for making guests sit in a hallway for most of an hour, front desk guy literally said that was too bad and I should just stay where I was. . 5:30 PM - into room 3. It had a visibly stained bedspread. While the nice housecleaning lady fixed it over 20 minutes, come on. . . This place isn't five stars. It's not even a Hampton Inn if consistency and courtesy count for anything.  I wouldn't stay here again and I would recommend anyone else think hard about staying somewhere else. . . Look, it may be a busy day for the hotel. But, there's no excuse for thirty minute hold times to speak to the front desk and there's no excuse for discourtesy. I've never been so frustrated with a hotel.
Took 40 minutes at check-in and we couldn't even get the fountain room we booked. So mad! We will NEVER stay here again!
My stay for 2 nights was OK. Kept sending me promotions. Just called to book the offer the resort offered. Said not showing up. Typical bait and switch. Not nice.
I will always have a special place in my heart for this hotel. My friend and I stayed here most recently during a fun girls weekend, and had a great experience. Our suite was large and spacious, and had an ample kitchenette that we didn't use. I love the beautiful flowers in the lobby, and the fact that you can walk almost anywhere near mid-strip from here. Really, you could stay here and never leave, and you would still experience some of my favorite things about Vegas (food + shows + shopping +spa).. . Room service was always quick and efficient, and we were never inconvenienced by it. The robs are super comfortable and warm, and the staff is always available and helpful with recommendations for shows, restaurants, etc.. . The only thing I don't love is that the casino can be a bit loud and of course smoky. Obviously, you have to walk through the casino to get to any hotel room. But, this is par for the course with Vegas hotels until you stay at a non-gaming hotel such as Vdara or Trump.. . I would highly recommend staying here for the experience. Plenty of shopping, and easily walkable to many other hotels and restaurants/shops near mid-strip.
I had very high hopes and was extremely disappointed in this beautiful hotel. I've stayed in Vegas 6 times before, all different hotels (PH towers, MGM, Cosmo....) ...Saving this one as my "dream hotel". Its really about one step up from the Monte Carlo -.-. . Obviously this hotel is only famous for being famous, not because its amazing. . I paid 700 for 2 nights 4 months in advance (so, deeply discounted due to pre-planning) for a Deluxe fountain view room. 2 queens & smoking.. . The difference between a deluxe & a regular fountain view room is apparently the "complimentary items" and WiFi...Save yourself $50+ and bring your own shampoo -.-. . BRING YOUR OWN WIFI HOTSPOT. . Their WiFi is HORRIFFIC and you pay extra for it!! If you can get it to connect, and KEEP it connected you'll never get a page loaded with the one bar. Not good when you have to have internet to work. Be prepared to drag your laptop to a Starbucks.. . I should have checked for a balcony on the listing, but I had assumed a smoking room would include one, or at the very least an opening window. You can not smoke in your room unless you intend to sleep in smoke. There is a huge pane glass window that doesn't open. it opens seriously a millimeter at the bottom. There is NO ventilation, the fan doesn't help. . . Even with a smoking room you have to go down to the casino to smoke!. . The bed was comfy but the sheets, blankets & towels were all uncomfortably cheap & scratchy :/ For the price of this hotel I'd expect not to be scraped up when drying off. . The room was Small, really small! Also, disappointing for the price. The furniture closes you in even more in this tiny room.. . The bathroom was big. The shower is big, all glass & tile floor so your feet are warm. The tub though is sad. Its regular sized but set back in so it's a dangerous pain in the ass to get in & out. Plus, no jacuzzi jets after all that work.. . The hotel lobby is absolutely gorgeous, the casino and everything is elegant & beautiful......the rooms are drab :/. . The only upsides - I got a $100 giftcard rebate to the Crystal Shops & the pool is heated to 85. . . All in all I felt like I really wasted my money here, unfortunately. . . For the same price or cheaper you can stay in a prettier room, with a balcony or jaccuzi or a bigger room with a couch....... or all! Also, your fountain view will probably be better just about anywhere without half the building blocking it.
I wright this review as a 2nd time guest.  Rooms were great as always.  Cleaning staff were friendly and helpful.  Guest services checking in were a little short and unwelcoming.  Security absolute pricks to even a mild mannered person such as myself.  Gambling was good until you sit at a table and have to listen to every dealer complain about how much they hate their job and how tired they are.  I found better dealer attitudes at the Aria next door.  Would I stay here again, sure but just for the rooms and the central location.
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100. . Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.. . LOCATION:. Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over. . EXTERIOR:. Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street. . INTERIOR:. Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning. Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling. . SHOPS:. Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!. . WHAT TO SEE:. Flowers in the entryway. Window shop in the expensive designer stores. Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!). Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain". The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time. . I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!
Disappointing. With a Four Seasons price you expect Four Seasons service/experience, but this is an economy hotel in dressed up as a luxury hotel. . . I loved having a big room with a view of the fountains and access to great shops. O was also fantastic and worth seeing. . . I hated the tremendous amount of noise and super packed lobby that had more rude and obnoxious people than I've seen at any other hotel in Vegas. They also nickel and dime you with Denny's caliber food at 5 star prices. The steaks were worse than your average Vegas buffet.. . Yellowtail had a great environment, view and presentation but the quality was like a conveyor belt (read Blue C Sushi) place with premium 5 star pricing. . . I enjoyed getting a chance to stay, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably stay at Four Seasons Mandalay Bay, MGM, or the Venetian. . . Check in is horrible and takes forever, so just plan to waste an hour doing that. Knowing that up front and planning for it will help save a lot of frustration. . . Service was terrible - it's the "we've got you now, so we don't have to try hard" attitude and you get nickeled and dimed for everything. Fees, fees and more fees so you should expect that your hotel room price should be a minimum of 50% of your daily expenses - assuming you DO NOT gamble.. . Olives was really really bad and overpriced too.. . The pool is too small and crowded - Mandalay Bay is the place to be if you care about pools. . I was so proud to be here and perhaps I expected too much, butI felt like MGM was significantly better for 1/2 the price - and I'm not a thrifty person. I'[ll gladly pay a premium price for premium service. i just don't think that is what I got here.. . With all of this said, if you have your heart set on staying here then definitely do it - just plan to move after a day so you can balance crossing this off your list and having a great experience in Vegas.
Great place to stay! Friendly staff, easy check in, good location, lots of restaurants and bar to choose from and friendly dealers . . Cons: the bed wasn't the comfiest, high table limits on weekends. I found myself walking across to Paris to gamble on Saturday night. Other than that it's a nice place to stay.
This place is fancy. Every time I come here, I feel like I can not afford anything. . . However, this place is just incredible to walk through. Beautiful shops, beautiful casino, and beautiful rooms. Definitely high class which gives to its flare. . . Also, I know this will be redundant but its fountain show is simply incredible. Such an incredible place to watch an incredible show. . . Come here to sight see but unless you have crazy money - try staying at Ballys (right across).. . Protip: You can take the tram here from Bellagio to Monte Carlo with a stop at Aria.
We've stayed at the Bellagio a few times and it is definitely one of the most spectacular resorts on the strip.  We had the premier fountain view room and watching the fountain show is one of the reasons I chose to stay here.  I also love the beautiful conservatory, gallery of fine art and all the shops and restaurants.  My all time favorite Cirque du Soleil show "O" is at the Bellagio.  The only downside is that it is very crowded especially during the holidays.
I was really disappointed by the Bellagio experience I had. I stayed at the bellagio jan 15-19, 2014 while working for a conference. I was part of a video crew and worked primarily in the room so I spent about 8 hours as day in there. There were two of us in a 2 bed average room facing caesars. The room was clean apart from the bathtub which looked like it hadn't been wiped out in a month. The bathroom door lock was broken which was awkward because I had several crew members in and out of the room. . . There were two incidents that stand out apart from the broken stuff. One was that I woke up with a massive spider bite on my face. That's just nuts. Maybe cleaning and maintenance standards are just low. The second and more troubling incident was that we went to a dinner at the conference and we were out of the room from 7pm to 1am. When we returned the door was open. The staff that had done the turn down service neglected to pull the door closed after they finished in there. We had tens of thousands of dollars of photo & video equipment inside and while luckily nothing was stolen it was still very worrisome. . . All in all I wouldn't bother with bellagio again. I've had great experiences at Wynn and flamingo. It really feels like bellagio is resting on its history. It's too bad.
Okay so, if you're an out of towner, in your forties (or fifties, sixties, seventies) and feel like ballin'- then the Bellagio is for you. But if you're younger and looking for the club scene and the beautiful people, go elsewhere.. . The Bellagio is upscale, but also a little retro in my opinion. The rooms have antiquated decor-mahogany armoires, heavy curtains and 1970's lamp shades. The bathrooms are large with vases glued down around the edges of a deep bathtub (very proactive Bellagio, very proactive). And of course if you fork up the big bucks, you're going to get a great view of the strip. . . But again, if you're twenty or thirty something, go blow your wad (of dollaz) in another hotel with a cool club attached to it (free entrance for guests typically). In Vegas, you probably won't even be spending that much time in your room. So, no matter where you stay, enjoy your friends and the ability to drink on the streets!
Stayed here many times but truly nothing special, wife has never been so took her for her b day. Nice rooms and grounds but there is better for less money. Pool and hot tub close at 4:00????? WTH? Staff is very friendly and attentive.
For an upscale hotel, Bellagio falls pretty short. It definitely has a grand atmosphere and looks classy; I felt more comfortable walking through the casino and shops at Bellagio than the casinos on the other side of the strip. The hotel, however, did not impress me.. . When I want to stay at a luxury hotel, I do so because I'm willing to pay more to be a bit spoiled, to have softer linens, and to be treated well. This hotel has so much volume that they clearly don't feel the need to treat their guests as guests; I felt very much like a revenue source. They had absolutely destroyed our reservation (it was specifically booked as four rooms all together and confirmed to be so), but when we arrived the rooms were not together. They weren't even on the same floor. Ok, these things happen at any place, from motels to five star. The difference between a motel and five star is that a five star should fix the problem with grace. Bellagio did no such thing, and their consolation prize was a miserly waiving of the resort fee. Gee, thanks - $200 off our reservation as compensation for the fact that our bonding girls trip is now an adventure in separation.. . The rooms were decorated nicely. I have no complaints about the surroundings other than the fact that said rooms are PACKED with furniture. If I'd stayed for more than a couple night's it would have felt like the walls were closing in on me. Removing the sitting area would have made it feel much less claustrophobic. The bathrooms are very large and I love the huge shower. The tub is small but deep. There was, however, a distinct lack of amenities. There wasn't even coffee in the room. Isn't it standard to wake up and enjoy a cup of coffee in your PJs in the morning while on vacation? That's the thing that got to me about Bellagio - those little touches to make it more than a nice-looking room just weren't there. I expect those little touches at luxury hotels, and Bellagio did not provide.. . A note on the buffet - absolutely worth the money. We ate at 10:30am so there was a mix of lunch and breakfast items, and despite the cost ($30 in January of 2014) it was worth it. The food was delicious and there was exceptional variety. The drink server was painfully, irritatingly slow, so don't expect a coffee refill. Come to think of it, perhaps Bellagio has a thing against providing coffee to it's guests?
The Bellagio has so much to offer.  Was recently there and saw the conservatory beautifully decorated in the Chinese New Year/Year of the Horse theme.  The theme changes often, so always worth a gander.  Of course, the fountains outside are one of, if not the, best free sight in Vegas.  The lobby with the Dale Chihuly ceiling glass sculptures are breathtaking and something you'd usually have to pay an art museum admission price to see (in many cities in the U.S., London, or worldwide). We were really looking forward to our (mid-Jan. 2014) visit to the Bellagio art gallery, but were disappointed to find it is currently temporarily closed.  This is one of the nicest hotels in Vegas...if you can't stay here, at least come and soak up the ambience.
From the moment I tried booking a room to the time I left... the customer service alone had me regretting booking a room here in the first place. . I called on a Friday to get a rate for Saturday night check in and check or on Sunday. I was quoted X amount by Deanna. I had to check my funds and asked when I call back can I  speak with you, Deanna has stated she made a note on my account (mlife). I called back five times and turns it Deanna had left foot the evening. I spoke with krissi and Esmeralda about the X amount I was quoted, they turn around and quote me a Y amount. . I escalate this further to there manager, Ron. He was very rude, talked down to me, and unprofessional in general. . I called back and some with a Chris who was the supervisor of everyone I had already spoken too. He was shoot to resolve thesituation and then some. . It's just unfortunate that people like myself pay a lot of money to get treated like garbage by the customer service reps. Especially at an establishment such as Bellagio. The customer service alone is making me not want to go back. I have gotten better service at Luxor, Rio, geez, even Riviera. If I am paying $200+ a night, I expect to be treated like a week paying customer. Because after all, it's people like me (worker bees) who keep these type of hotels going.
Great restaurants and great site seeing, having the fountains and the locations is the way to go when staying in Las Vegas
So beautiful and luxurious! Had the fountain view and was able to see a different view of the water show. Room was super comfy and clean, I can't wait to visit again!
On a recent Vegas getaway with my husband, we decided to go big and try a stay at the famed Bellagio.  It's supposed to be the best of the best, so our expectations were high.  We upgraded to a suite in hopes of a luxurious, relaxing experience... no such luck.  . . Check in was disorganized, but tolerable.  The lobby was packed as usual, but we planned to stay through the weekend and into the week.  I figured the crowds would die down a little; I was wrong.  The Bellagio is a super popular tourist destination, and even on an off weekend in January, it was jam packed.  The really unfortunate part of that is the SMOKE!  Bellagio allows smoking in the casino, and apparently has no filtration system whatsoever.  It smelled worse than a lot of the older casinos, and was completely inescapable.  So, gambling was off the table.. . Next was our "upgraded" Bellagio Suite.  The decor was over-the-top and a little outdated, but nice enough.  The big problem was the ratty, torn-up holes in the carpet and the bedding (I'll include pictures).  At $350+ a night, I didn't expect orphanage linens.  There were two tv's in the suite - one in the bedroom, and one in the living room area.  Both were small (maybe 25"?) and old.  The living room tv's sound cut out every 5 seconds or so, making it impossible to watch.  I didn't go to Vegas to watch tv, but I like to be a little lazy on vacation.  . . The last straw was the service.  We ordered in-room breakfast.  When the lady arrived with the table, she pushed it into the middle of the living room and said "I'll leave this here."  No 'good morning,' no 'where would you like the table?', etc.  Not a huge deal, but pleasantries are always appreciated.  My husband signed the bill and handed it back, she looked it over and said "You're not gonna leave a tip?  YOU KNOW gratuity isn't included."  No, we didn't know.  This is the first hotel we'd ever been to that didn't include a healthy gratuity on in-room dining.  He quickly adjusted the bill to tip her (even after her rude behavior), and she left without another word.  I completely agree with tipping the wait staff, but she could have mentioned it nicely when handing over the bill, instead of insinuating that we tried to skip out on it. . . At this point, our vacation had reached a low point, and it needed to be salvaged.  I walked through the smoky lobby to the front desk.  A Bellagio employee named Michael approached me, and asked what he could help with.  I explained the situation, and he was nice enough, taking notes.  I told him I just wanted out of our remaining nights, with no cancellation fee, so that we could continue our vacation elsewhere.  He set us up for checkout that day, and said he would see what he could do about removing some of our charges, since we'd had such an unpleasant stay.. . When we checked out, the front desk attendant asked us how we had liked the room.  We were honest, "It was pretty bad, actually."  She ignored it, and said nothing else as she handed us our bill.  As expected, we were billed for everything... they didn't remove any charges.  Yet another sign of Bellagio's we-don't-give-a-f*ck attitude.  It was perfectly fine, though, since we were finally free of this run-down hotel.. . We high-tailed it over to Encore, where the service checking in was so characteristically fantastic that it reminded us what a great hotel should be.  And I forgot my toiletry bag at Bellagio.  It took several calls to the lost and found, where I gave "Melissa" the room number, the description, my name and phone number.  She sighed loudly and told me "It's going to take me all night to look through everything, so I'll just call you back later."   After more prodding I finally got it back, and it was another disdained trip to Bellagio to pick it up.  . . This hotel and it's couldn't-care-less staff left a really terrible taste in my mouth.  I won't even be back to shop.. . TL;DR - super smoky and crowded casino, torn-up holes in the carpet and bedding, tiny broken tv's, and a rude, apathetic staff of employees who hate Bellagio as much as I do.
The Mecca of swank.  Beautifully decorated for Chinese New Year  for year of the horse.  Awesome breakfast buffet.  I Just feel happy here!!
I was really let down by the Bellagio, we stayed here a year ago and didn't have a great time but I thought we would try it again. I wish we would have saved our cash for another hotel. This place is really going down hill. Bad service....old looking rooms...bad tvs....horrible losses in the casino...I don't think we even came close to winning anything here this time. Not to mention its over the top crowded. Honestly tey across the street if you want a view of the fountains and not pay an arm and a leg for a room at the Bellagio.
