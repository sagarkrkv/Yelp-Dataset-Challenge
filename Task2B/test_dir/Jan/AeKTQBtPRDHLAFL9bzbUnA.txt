Always busy, sometimes underrated. Love their pork belly. I wish they have more servers because of the long wait all the time. It quite in the middle of nowhere for me. I get claustrophobic and they placed us in the middle of the room so I was quite uneasy.
The food is really what gets the 4 stars! All you can eat dinner for $26 was worth it! The customer service could have been much better :/ our server seemed as if she hated being there and had very little personality when coming to our table. Could've been a bad night for her. The sushi was yummy! But Yama is still out favorite!
I have searched for months for a good sushi place and now I have found it. I went for all you can eat and it is the best deal i have found so far, and that does include dessert.   I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar as you will get a direct line to the sushi chef, they are very attentive and quick to give you your order. Be sure to order the Athena roll
I have been a faithful Goyemon customer for years! It's always the spot I choose for my birthday and other special family get-togethers. The other day my sister and I went to eat AYCE and she came home with food poisoning. Threw up everything on the floor. And she hasn't thrown up in 9 years! We ate the exact same food except I didn't eat super white tuna. I know that super white tuna asks like a laxative and makes people want to use the bathroom but this occurrence showed me that there must be something wrong with their food. I'm not upset but that but more that I kindly called the restaurant to warn them. The receptionist said the manager would call me back and he never did to apologize or thank that I took the time to warn them before they poison other people. She even asked for my name and number. Will not be returning. Very bittersweet since I love Goyemon's food.
This is one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places.  There's always interesting specials on the menu.  I think I had smoked salmon sushi and striped bass as specials last time I went.  The decor is done in warm tones and is Japanese minimalistic.  Everything is very fresh.  It is the only all you can eat sushi place I have ever been to where I order Hamachi and they give me Hamachi Belly without prompting.  Yum.  The only thing bad I can say about the place is they don't have agedashi tofu and soft shell crab as part of the all you can eat appetizers.
Being a very avid and frequent sushi seeker, I enjoy coming back to Goyemon, especially for the AYCE!. . Although their menu is very extensive and broad with variety, I believe I have selected my fair share of must have items after about a dozen visits.  . . Ecstasy roll is always what I order first. Tuna based roll with a topping of seaweed salad and roe finished in a light creamy sauce. Truly fulfilled the expectation of a food high. . . Salmon skin hand roll is simple but just done so right and deliciously.  . . Pork belly is absolutely craveable. Seriously amazing product and execution on the grill. Comes perfectly glistening in a slightly sweet and savory sauce with a refreshing acidic mango salsa to tame that rich, meaty, umami unctuousness. . . All of the deserts are excellent. My favorites being the chocolate mousse, mochi ice cream, and especially the Yuzu sherbet. Its the perfect citrusy, light palate cleanser to end your meal after eating all the fatty fresh fish you can handle. . . Service is really a hit or miss, as well as the wait times, which, at some visits have been disappointing enough to effect the whole meal feel vibe, and having sushi kaya as another frequent option/alternative.
I'm a frequent at Goyemon and nine times out of 10 they deliver.. . The service more times than not is quick and efficient.  There is one waitress there that I'm not very fond of, but most of the other servers bust their ass on a daily basis.  Food is churned out a consistent rate, but don't be afraid to be on top of the servers...there have been a few times when our order was misplaced by the chefs.  . . The wait times during peaks hours are LONG.  Expect on Friday and Saturday night to be waiting up to 1.5 hours for a seat and they absolutely do not take reservations.  However, the wait is very much worth the experience.  I'd recommend heading over to PT's a block down and grabbing a beer while you wait for them to call and tell you that your table is ready.  They're pretty flexible and understanding that it may take you five minutes to get back to the restaurant to get to your seats.  In addition, I would highly recommend going here for dinner, than going during lunch.  The service and food has always been better in the evening than during the day.. . The overwhelmingly majority of the time the fish is as fresh as it gets in Vegas (there was a good two visits in a months time during the past year and a half that my partner and I have been going their where the freshness was questionable.  However, it was temporary.  The next time we visited the quality was excellent.).  They will often have some very beautiful cuts of tuna that are just to die for.. . I find it quite impressive for an AYCE restaurant to be serving this quality of meat.  The range of items you can an order on the AYCE menu is insane, but I love the variety.  I would recommend the following if you're going to be doing all you can eat for the first time:. . Nigiri:. - Yellowtail. - Garlic tuna. - Super White Tuna (melts in your mouth...so good!  My absolute favorite!). - Cajun tuna or cajun albacore (cajun tuna is a special and they run out quick, but I find cajun albacore to be a great substitute).. - Red snapper. . Grill:. - Steamed edamame (I find the the garlic edamame to be far too greasy, stick with the steamed!). - Pork belly. - Super white (it's a special). - Yellowtail. . Rolls:. - Magma. - Sexy girl (the cucumbers pair so well with this roll). - Crispy rice . - Yebeisu. - Salmon skin. . Dessert:. . - Red bean ice cream!  . - I'm not a big green tea fan, but everyone tells me that their green tea creme brulee is excellent.. . If you just want to try a bunch of different rolls, than you can order half a roll for the large majority of the items.  Trust me for the tempura and especially the baked items...you may want too!. . For a quality sushi dinner (that just happens to be AYCE) at $26 for dinner...it's hard to be beat.  You just have to know when to go and hope you don't get the one waitress that will drive you nuts!
tasty nigiri - you'd want to stick to the nigiri and anything written on the board. . must add quail egg on something. . order anything from the grill
This is my go-to AYCE sushi place in Vegas. I always find myself craving not only the sushi, but also the side-dishes and even the dessert. These are my usuals:. . Rolls: . - Sexy Girl (shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna, crumbs, and eel sauce). - Pastel (crab stick and cream cheese, topped with shrimp, avocado, and eel sauce). - Magma (shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon, eel sauce and Sriracha). . Side Dishes:. - Pork Belly (my favorite, but only included in dinner price AYCE). - Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (panko-breaded rice topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce, and spicy mayo, also only included in dinner price AYCE). . Desserts:. - Tempura Ice Cream (it tastes like they use cake batter). - Green Tea Creme Brulee (it's usually only on their board of special desserts). . The rolls are really good, and it's really convenient because one menu has pictures of all the rolls, while the other gives descriptions of them.. . As for the service, they're really good! I never have to usually ask for them, as they're really attentive and come to me as much as they can to check on me.. . The only downside is that the wait times can get really long. Sometimes I've had to wait over an hour. It is a pretty popular sushi place, and they don't accept reservations. Also, they don't typically seat you until you're entire party has arrived.. . Overall, I really enjoy this place. I would definitely recommend it.
The sushi is amazing! We had all you can eat sushi which totalled 33 per person with tip for dinner. We had up to 4 different kinds of rolls per person with various side dishes and even dessert. Yuzu sherbet was amazing. The pixie, spider and hurricane rod were excellent. . . Worth the wait!
Me and my girlfriend go to this place all the time when we are craving sushi. This is the place to come for AYCE. Everything is good here from the rolls to nigiri and the appetizers. Well where to start the pork belly here is the best tender and savory just right, I always have to order it when i come here, its cooked to perfection. The nigiri selection is good, the fish is fresh tasting and not frozen  and the rice they use is not hard not like other places I've been to. The specials they have are really good the salmon belly is excellent and the Japanese snapper is flawless. If you're craving sushi and you're up for AYCE come to goyemon you won't regret it. Just to let you know they dont take reservations sometimes there is a wait to get seated but the wait is worth it.
I think it is a sin not to order AYCE, so this review is only for that portion of the experience.. . This restaurant is by far the best AYCE sushi place in Las Vegas.. . The rolls are delicious, and the option to order half-rolls is VERY helpful is you want to try a vast variety of rolls. The servers are usually attentive; however, they can seem a bit surprised if you can eat sushi like you're a human vacuum.. . I also enjoyed the side dishes. My favorite is probably the pork belly. The dessert is also unlimited (surprise, surprise), and you cannot go wrong with Mochi Ice Cream or the Lychee.. . However, keep in mind that this restaurant does not take reservations. If you are with a large group, you may have a long wait ahead of you, even on a weekday. If you'd like to make a reservation for AYCE, I recommend Island Sushi in Henderson.
Four words!  GREEN.  TEA. CREME. BRULEE.  Another four words...ALL.  YOU.  CAN.  EAT.. . I've been here a couple times and I was full both time!  I will make some suggestions and give some advise when you visit here:. . * If you don't want to wait at least an hour you should during their off hours (i.e. lunch or dinner times).  This place isn't very big, just be warned.. * They are open late with the last seating at 2AM (yes that's 2 in the morning). * If you have a small group or even just want to try something new, don't be afraid to order half rolls (if you like that type of sushi). * Most of the sushi is all you can eat with the exception of the uni (sea urchin) and the sweet shrimp. * Small groups (3 or less) opt for the sushi bar because it maybe first available (i.e. you get seated faster and you get your sushi faster). * Look at the chalkboard near the sushi bar, this has specials and in-season items not found on the menu. . I tried so many of the rolls I don't remember which ones I had, but I remembered I liked them all.  My mom loves the white tuna here.  You wouldn't expect fish to taste so fresh in Vegas but it does!  You must get the green tea creme brulee!  I will be back soon!  I hope I don't forget my stamp card!
By far the WORST customer service ever. . A few months ago the hubby dined with a buddy and was asked to leave after they paid their bill and the server collected the 30% tip. We actually boycotted thisplace but decided to go back because it was close to where we live. We walked into the restaurant sat for 20 minutes waiting for a table during lunch time. Although all the tables were 2 tops and we were 2+ a baby we were never acknowledged. However 2 people walked in and were immediately assisted. When I approached the waitress/hostess she said well you guys are a party of 3. Wow....I actually gotten way better service at fast food restaurants before. Restaurant is decent but I'm not going bother spending my money there with that kind of service.
I wanted sushi for lunch and Goyemon was the closest(lucky me). I just had a few rolls since I wasn't extremely hungry but those few rolls were packed with flavor. very clean inside and the staff is very friendly and quick to get you more roll or fill your drinks. I will come back for the AYCE very soon.
We were out on a Friday night date...our favorite sushi place was sold so we were looking for a new place...we drove around two three different places and finally ended here..they said it was an hour wait...but we waited..(which we never do) and so glad we did...it only took 40 minutes and the food was great!! Service from Shima was even better!! All orders came fast and delicious!! Will definately come back again...
I love sushi! This place has a lot to offer. They are fast with bringing out the orders and are always checking on the table to make sure we are okay and that our empty plates are taken away. I love this place because they have a variety of different rolls for those who like fancy rolls. I also like it because their nigiri is very generous. The slices of fish are very thick and the ratio of fish to rice is extremely fair. The rice sticks out of the fish at most places but not here! It was basically a chunk of fish with a side of rice. Yum. The only reason I rated this place 4/5 stars is because the wait is always super long! My friends and I went during lunch time and the wait was 1.5 hours! I was starving by the time we got seated but I am glad we waited because it was well worth it.
Such a yummy place! Service is so AMAZING!!! I have a seafood allergy and they are always remember and keep me safe!!! Food is so good as well! Will always recommend this place to anybody who wants any kind of seafood!!!
One of my favorite sushi places! Great all you can eat options - with appetizers & soup - yummy! The fish always tastes fresh and the servers are always nice! Volanco roll, red dragon and sexy girl are a few of the best! If you like spicy rolls, try the 9-1-1 roll - my husband loved it but be prepared with a lot of water, by the look on his face, it was hot!
Although it was a long wait. It was worth it because I was able to stuff my face with good food and good company.
So last time I came here with a large group, I expected a long wait. Tonight, I came here with a group of 4 including me. They told us the wait was half an hour. We ended up waiting 1 hour in the cold... Because there was no room inside. I was very annoyed!. . They also kept bringing us items that we did not order throughout the night. I didn't mind the first couple times but after at the end, when we were clearly finished, the server still brought plates over to us thinking it was ours? Meh.. . . The food was still amazing nonetheless. Ate too much and did not save room for dessert. I saw the green tea creme brulee here on yelp but it wasn't on their menu. If I had known they had this, I totally would have made room for dessert. Oh well; that just means I'll have to come again lol
This was my second visit to Goyemon. My first one was about two years ago and at the time I wasn't too impressed. . . I was in the mood for AYCE and was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd try it again. $26.95 for AYCE with a nice sized menu. . . I got a few orders of Nigiri: cajun albacore, garlic tuna, seared tuna, and super white tuna. All were cut nicely and tasted fresh. I got a few orders of baked mussels and a tuna poki salad. Both of which were great.. . Probably my favorite thing about Goyemon is they allow AYCE patrons to order half rolls, score! I ordered a half ecstasy, a half pastel and a half calico along with a pixie roll. . . The pixie roll was my least favorite, it was wrapped in soy paper and the seaweed paper, but the seaweed was too chewy, I had trouble breaking it up. It wasn't like that on the other rolls however. . . My favorite was the ecstasy roll, I ended up ordering another half of that. Then of course tempura ice cream for dessert.. . I should note that I wasn't alone, so don't go thinking I put all that away on my own :). . I gave it 4 stars due to the space alone, really crowded and it feels like your on top of the tables around you, not for the food. Overall this time the food and the service was great, I will be making many return visits.
