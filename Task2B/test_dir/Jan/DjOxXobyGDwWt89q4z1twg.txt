One of the best Ramen places in US. It definitely goes into top three of our Ramen list. . It's a bit crowded at dinner time and you might need towait like 15 minutes. But once we had our food, all the waiting is worthwhile!. It's a small place and we sat at counter. Once you got seated, the service is pretty fast. My bf ordered tonkotsu soyu and I got tonkotsu.. The soup base if very thick and rich, very yummy, feels like a good stew from good pork. And the noodle is just right, not too soft and not too hard. Try eat noodle dipped in soup in one bite, it's heaven. :) I almost finished the whole bowl. The bowl is cheap like 6.95 - 8.95. You can add extra topping if you want. It only comes with chashu and a bit veggie for my meal but the good taste makes me happy enough.. They don't have other sides or appetizers. As far as I remember, only gyozer and some fried rice. If I go LV later and want some Asian food, that'll probably be the first item popped into my mind.
the pork was delicately sliced and the broth was excellent. However, it was over an hour wait and we got there before it opened. it's comparable to the places I've tried in the SF Bay Area but I presume this is the best of Vegas so far.
Waited for like an hour but totally worth it! Gyoza was good but I was surprised it ddn't come with its own special sauce. Ramen is to die for ;)
Hands down the best tonkotsu ramen ever. I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen. It adds the taste to the broth, and it's not too spicy. Wife had shoyu ramen. Also taste great. The broth is not oily at all and the pork (chasu) melts in your mouth.. Place is so small. We came about 5 minutes before they open for lunch on Friday and the line is already long outside. We had to wait for the next available table. It's definitely worth the wait. Service is great too.. Definitely a pace to visit.
First time here. Arrived 30 minutes before they opened, with about 25 people ahead of us. Waited 1.5hrs to get in and after getting inside saw why. This place is small. I would say 20-25 people at the most can dine inside. Ordered the spicy tonkatsu and was not very impressed. I'll try the other new location before I decide on whether to eat at either location again but my initial experience wasn't good.
Best ramen I've had in the USA.. . I used to live in Japan, so I miss having the option of eating ramen. I've tried it at several places in the US, and haven't found anything close until I went to Monta. . . I always order the tonkatsu ramen and request the noodles to be on the hard side, which is called 'katame'. It adds a bit of texture to the noodles and is an option you can always ask for in Japan. . . This is one of the places I always stop at when I'm in Vegas.
First time eating "fancy" ramen as opposed to the top ramen I'm used to at home lol. When I went it was very busy so we had to put our name down and waited about 20 minutes or so. . . We got seated at the bar and my friend recommended the tonkatsu ramen with nori and egg. The messed up on our order and thought we said corn instead of nori but it wasn't a big deal. The waitress brought our our nori in a separate bowl and only charged us for the corn which was 25 cents cheaper than the nori :) . . The ramen was so good! Not too salty and not to watery, just perfect. Also when you eat the pork it literally melts in your mouth. Staff was great also. I will definitely be coming back here!
The first time I reviewed Monta almost 3 years ago (wow!), it was really my first experience with ramen.  Since then, ramen places have popped up all over the valley, giving Monta competition.  And, IMHO, the competition wins.  I won't name my favorite place in this review because we're not supposed to per TOS, but my most recent visit to Monta reinforced my higher regard for my favorite place down the street.  Not that Monta is terrible, mind you.  It has plenty of avid fans, my good friend being one; she doesn't like my favorite place at all.  We came here for lunch last week because she loves her some Monta; she comes here so often that the staff knows her order.  We arrived ten minutes before they opened on a Friday morning and there were already 25 people waiting in line!  Monta staff hand out a waiting list for everyone to sign in on, so that's how I know the number.  When we got in the doors, my friend and I plus one other couple were the last to be seated, so capacity in the joint is about 29 people, if my math is correct; this includes sitting at the counter.  We ended up at the counter and that was actually a fun place to be because we got to watch the cooks at work.  We both had the shoyu ramen and I added eggs and corn to mine.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food; I should have ordered an appetizer.  I usually get edamame, but they don't offer it on the menu--weird.  This is a very small space and once it fills up, the line is steady waiting for people to hurry up and eat.  It's been a while since I've been back here and the ramen is good, but given the choice, I choose the other place.
Its good for young people but its not good for the family.. Waiting thirty five minutes outside and still not getting seat. It's very unorganized when they called the guests. They called whatever they like. People stands and comes inside also they don't have highchairs for your little one..Resto it's very small. It's like Motel 6 Hotel with tiny rooms and dirty.. Pro: only tonkatsu delicious. Cons: Waiting an hour to be from you write down your name until to have a food..            Serve very very slow...They make it very slow so looks like a lot of people a line but actually it's not like that if they serve fast. Their strategy made it this way.. Won't comeback again. VERY DISAPPOINTING SERVICE!!!..
I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.. . Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.. . Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.. . Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.. . Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. . . Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!. Nose ~ Smells good!.. Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!. Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!. Tummy ~ Satisfied.
I was told on several occasions that Chinatown was the place to eat in Vegas. I didn't believe it until I took the first bite at Monta.. . It was a chilly day, and nothing could beat the satisfaction found at the bottom of that ramen bowl. Monta is tucked in a small strip small. There's limited seating inside, but we didn't wait long at all and sat at the bar. I actually prefer this since we could watch the kitchen in action.. . Everything is EXTREMELY affordable. I got a huge bowl of ramen (with a few addition) for the same price as 1 fancy hot dog on the strip. I opted for the Tonkotsu and added corn and egg. We also had the Gyoza to start. The Gyoza were perfect, so light and airy. Dipping them in a mix of soy with sesame oil with a dash of their spices made it that much better. The bowl of ramen was huge! I tried to force myself to finish it because it was so good. I was going to add spices to the broth, but it was fantastic on its own so I didn't mess with it. The noodles were soft and the egg was the perfect addition. I wish I could have another bowl right now with this cold outside!. . What I also enjoyed about this restaurant was the design. It wasn't the typical meh photo with a description underneath. They took the time to take beautiful photos of all their dishes and explain them appropriately. It really makes a difference.. . The staff was nice. The place was busy and they kept everything on pace. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.
On our quest for best ramen in Vegas, this was #2 of 3... . . TONKATSU RAMEN w/thick noodles + egg - Broth is an improvement from Sora, noodles still overdone.  Pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth, sliced thin and complemented the salty broth. . COLD NOODLES(SESAME) rivaled Monkey's Gold Standard of Ramen, Daikokuya in Los Angeles...    A wait out the door did not exceed 45mins, as there are far more tables than Sora.  . . Monkey sat at the bar where you can see all the magic happen.  Sometimes you don't want to know how the trick is done, though.  Watching someone put the cooked pork in the same bin as the raw, troubled my mind on the way out.  I heard it being said, yet to see it happen, Monkey disappointed and feared the future sitting.... . Parking is somewhat better, even though it's a shared parking lot with several other businesses.
OMG!!!!. This place is out of this world!! The menu is short and to the point but wow!! I usually don't give a place 5 stars but this was worth the short wait outside in the cold. Try any of the soups and I added corn for a more comfort food feel! The beverages and food overall was cheap for the quality.  I will be back and I can't wait!
Love the ramen. It was just what I needed after a long week in Vegas. Had the spicy tonkatsu with egg and was delicious. Adding to places that I will be back to while in Vegas.
This place I've heard is usually crowded and there's a bit of a wait but it's not too bad. The menu is short and sweet along with photos just how I like it. The food was delicious! I plan on heading back here again!
Alright, so in the 3 days 4 nights we were in Vegas, we came here twice....I love ramen! I can seriously eat it every single day of my life! They're pretty damn good and pretty close to the quality you would find in Japan....too bad we can't find a place like this in Chicago! I would 100% would have given this place  stars....if it wasn't for the snotty older waitress....My friends who recommended this place did specifically warned me about the older woman who doesn't crack a smile and does not understand the meaning of the word hospitality....Lady, you're bad for business! Either find a job you like or crack a smile and be more welcoming! . . But service is quick like any ramen place should be, and the broth to noodle ratio was perfect! I loved how their noodles were not in a giant ball and it was cooked the right way. You go to crappy places, you get noodles that are over cooked like  olive garden or almost stiff noodles as if ramen is meant to be al dente pasta. Monta's broth was pretty darn good too! I only wish they didn't charge ridiculous amounts for the extra topping....what could be a mind blowing cheap mean turns into a meal where I spent just as much on the toppings as the bowl of ramen itself.
So last time I was here in this plaza I notice 5 restaurants. But Monta had a line just to get in. Like out the door make you think that place must be Good kind of line. If you ain't one of the first 25 ppl in there as soon as they open. You gonna wait. Either way a wait well Worth It. So far The Best Ramen I ever had.
I like this place, but have come less over time because of the crowds you have to fight through to get a table here. If you come on a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 min to get a table since they don't have very many. Enjoyed it a lot more the 1st few times I came here but have been less impressed lately. Seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.. . I've had the ramen, fried rice, and pork belly bowl here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. Sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...I'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten. Hopefully they will look into expanding or adding another location to alleviate the crowd issue here.
Oh lord, ramen at its best!. . This is a must visit place for all my Vegas trips from now-on.. . The place is small, but the service is quite quick.. . Be prepared to wait for quite awhile to be seated if the restaurant is booming.  Due to limited seating and people seeming to socialize with their friends, the wait time may be ridiculous.. . The food is great, but their should be a plan to keep the flow moving.  Other than that, and since that cannot yet be controlled without a proper setup in the restaurant layout, I still give this place a 5 for being as best as it could be.
It is a tradition...and a MUST to eat some sort of noodle and soup combo after a long inebriated weekend in Las Vegas. Monta Ramen is one of my go-to spots upon exiting the city of sin.. . Very small location, but huge flavors!. . Get here early or you will be getting blue-balled by the aroma and presence of the MONTA RAMEN.. . *Oh yes...if you need a place to hang out or wait...I suggest the bar across the plaza...$4 beers and video casino games kept me entertained.. . When we sat down, they had 2 specials: Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkatsu. Both sounded absolutely amazing...it took me a while to figure out which bowl I should get...but I finally came to a conclusion within minutes. I ORDERED BOTH!. . In addition, I also ordered a bowl of Pork Belly with rice and a nice Sapporo to go with the meal. Oh yes, how could I forget...GETTING AN EGG IS A MUST!. . The food came out...everything was heavenly. The noodle was firm to an appropriate al dente - ramen style. The broth wasnt too thick where it came off as a sauce. Hearty, packed with immense flavor, and delicious. So delicious that all the asians DID NOT want to waste the extra effort and time to publish their food on facebook or instagramn. . . My experience was great. The only thing that sucked was the 4 hour drive home to OC + food coma + food baby.. . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. . UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
I have tried pretty much all the ramen place in LA n this place is like the #1 ramen on my list (daikokuya in little Tokyo is #1 tooo!!!) The soup base for the ramen was incredible i've never tasted anything this good (not too salty, n rich in beef flavor, plus the soup is not like liquid, its a little bit thick n jelly-ish). I also order the fried rice.... holy mother of monkey balls.... it was so good I didn't know someone can cook fried rice to this level... this place is incredible. . . A MUST TRY ramen if ur in vegas.
This is the best place in Vegas to have Ramen! Seating is minimal but we'll worth the wait. Friendly service and priceis on point.
Best Tonkatsu ramen in LV in my opinion.  Much better than Sora which was a disappointing experience.
The Best Ramen in Las Vegas. . I have been a regular here at Monta Ramen for quite some time and have been recommending this noodle house for many. . . Pros: Monta Ramen provides a traditional Japanese style ambiance with transparent view in kitchen that portrays confidence and quality in its product. Monta's Tonkatsu style ramen is delicious and perfectly prepared. The broth never gets old and is always ready to fulfill. Monta offers perfectly balanced side dishes (fried rice, gyoza, etc) and options to upgrade ramen dishes.  Service is quick and generally helpful. . . Cons: The size of the restaurant is small and can be an issue when hosting larger parties. The wait time especially during prime hours (lunch and dinner) can be an issue. All parties must be present upon seating. Be weary of writing your name down on the clipboard; my party got overlooked recently and the host sat three parties before mine. . . Overall, the quality of food trumps the service.  A must visit for tourists!
I do not understand the hype about this place. It's cramped, hella dark, and their soup is SALTY. I am a fan of salt, but after eating here, I always get a sodium induced headache. I have tried this place THREE times (in hopes that maybe each timewas just an 'off-night') but every time we have visited, same experience. . . Pros- The service is great, the toppings to the ramen are delicious, and the food comes out fast.. . .... But it's just not enough to keep me coming back.
Excellent service.  Tonkotsu shoyu ramen is my favorite.  Love this place I know it's super busy but its worth the wait. I've never had a bad experience there and I at least go there twice a month. I love it when the manager is the cook she is best!!!
What makes their ramen really good is the chashu. It is tender and flavorful.. Their gyoza is pan fried, but I prefer deep fried.. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's too small & claustrophobic.. There's almost always a wait for a table unless you go during off-peak hours.. Once you get seated, the service is pretty good.
Don't come here for the tonkotsu ramen. . . We came here for lunch and the wait was about 40 minutes.  The service was quick and friendly but the place felt a bit dirty, was a bit dark, and the seating was very cramped together.  . . I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with flavored eggs and seaweed.  Do Not Order this.   The broth was disappointingly salty and thick.   Seriously salty!  I had to go through 2 full cups of water and I still felt that wasn't enough.   After 1/3 of the way, I had to eat the ramen without the broth, which was unfortunate because the broth is what makes the ramen.  On the upper side, the noodles and eggs were perfectly cooked!. . Would I come back?  Probably not.   Again, don't order the tonkotsu ramen unless you want to be on a sodium high.
This is a small ramen shop in the back of a little plaza, there were people waiting outside before I got there (about 9:15pm on a Saturday night), and an even longer line by the time we ate and left (10:30pm). This is typical of ramen restaurants - the service was friendly and pretty quick (minus the waiting for a table part), but the reason for the 3-stars is the incredibly salty broth. I love ramen and have eaten at some of the best places in LA, and this just cannot compare. The noodles and toppings are fine, but the broth is so salty (and almost thick) that I couldn't even drink it. Perhaps it gets salter when it's later in the day, but I would not want to go back.
We came here on a saturday afternoon around 1220 and it was super packed. We waited for an hourish but it's also because we had a party of 9. This place is right next to Raku and a korean restaurant. . . We ordered a bowl of Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with an extra order of egg, kimchee fried rice, and gyoza. Let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....HOWEVER it was better than I expected. I have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than I expected. The broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. The noodles weren't bad. . . The gyoza was really good. It was crispy and theinside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. . . The Kimchee Fried rice was the shiitttt. No joke. I think I'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee fried rice to be honest. It was moist and tasty. So much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. There are restaurants that makes it super dry but Monta made it perfectly. Obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. It was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. We ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.. . I would seriously come back only to get the fried rice...I'm really curious about the takana fried rice too. Service was actually really good and I actually gave Monta a 4 just because of the fried rice...or else I would probably give it a two stars. . . The lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the fried rice, and be happy with life.
I crave Monta Ramen. It's a staple example of decently priced, quality, authentic food that's worth the comeback visit(s). Although fair warning, beware the wait times and lines for this anticipated and sought out food.    . . I have had most variations here and there, but I am a die hard miso fan and prefer to try the miso anywhere. There is only 4 broth bases to choose from along with the occasional special, as well as a nice side menu with a lot of other small dishes to choose from. . . As for the Miso. The salty creaminess with those thick bodied noodles always fulfills the appetite and keeps the taste buds impatient to scoff down more. Simply comes with 2 pieces of Chatsu pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, and mushroom.. . A little skimpy with pork in my opinion, but it temps meto order extra because it really is the best I've ever had. So rich and flavorful and tender. Fat and all should absolutely be savored. You must also pay for additional toppings such as butter, nori, etc. I either get a side of kimchi or the small pork belly bowl which is equally delicious and abundantly layered in a rice bowl.. . I applaud the waitresses for their patience and kindness. The place is almost always beyond busy and full, yet they still handle and attend to customers quickly and with a good attitude. . . I always recommend to friends, but this is a fairly fairly small venue for such popularity (they have also recently opened another one in Henderson) so either have a treat for adventurous self, or go with a few friends, but not very accommodating for very large parties.
I've had a lot of ramen in Las Vegas and Monta is my go-to ramen place; hands down the best ramen I've had in town. I usually order a Tonkotsu or a Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra Pork Chashu (4pcs for 2.50). Occasionally I also get the regular size Pork Belly Bowl.. . Their ramen broth is full of flavor and you can mix and match a variety of different toppings to your liking for a cheap price. They give you a large and filling amount of ramen in your first bowl and if you're still hungry you can order another bowl of ramen noodles (Kaedama) for $1.50. You do need to save some of your broth though because they will give you a bowl of noodles and that's it.. . As much as I want to give this place 5 stars, the only thing holding me back is their service. I always feel like I am being rushed to order, eat, pay, and leave so another party can take my seat. I don't blame them because it's always packed and they have to fit everyone who has been waiting in line, but it does suck when you feel like you're being rushed to eat good food.. . Overall, I love this place. I try not to come here with large parties because of the amount of time it would take to get the open tables. But this is definitely one of my favorite places for a good, affordable meal.
I freggin' love Monta Ramen. This baby is made of mostly Miso Ramen and thin noodles...let me explain.. . I'm pregnant, and Monta Ramen was already an obsession before this pregnancy, been a customer for years...but now...the obsession is on overdrive. The broth, all 4 choices, are always consistent in flavor. Ramen Sora, right down the street from Monta, is a good spot also but the flavor of their broth choices are not consistent; and if I'm craving ramen, I like to know the flavor will be what I expect....and Monta does it for me. . . This place is almost always packed.. . If you're a first time Monta visitor, here are some suggestions based on the embarrassing amount of times I've been there and taken newbies with me:. . Always order your noodles al dente, whether you're getting the thin noodles or wavy noodles. . . If you're into a thinner broth, order the Shoyu Ramen.. . If you're into a thicker and richer broth, order the Tonkatsu Ramen - no jokes, this stuff is super rich...and heavy on the pork flavor.. . Order all the topping on the side, so you don't have to fish out the stuff you realize you don't like. . . My favorite....the Miso Ramen with thin al dente noodles. 2/3 of the time, I order extra noodles after I demolish the first round. . . Hope you enjoy your experience there!
Nothing special, other than the fact that in addition to pork broth they also have chicken broth (Halal friendly!!) Though I've had better ramen, this will do the job when you're hungover. Prices are normal. . . Get there early, as the line is LONG. We got there 10 mins before it opened and still has to wait 30 minutes to be seated--the line was THAT long.
I would have to say that Monta is the best ramen joint in Vegas that I've been to. $7-$8 for a bowl (that's pretty big in my opinion) and it's worth every penny. You can add extra toppings and or even order extra noodles if you're still hungry. They also have a variety of side dishes that you can order with your meal. . . When I go to monta, I usually order a tonkatsu ramen. I like to get thick-wavy noodles instead of thin noodles as well. Ramen usually comes with two pieces of pork chashu, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and green onions.Their broth is flavorful and thick in a way. I swear it's pretty freaking good. The bowl usually comes pretty fast even if the place may be packed so that's a plus as well. . . I also enjoy their pork belly bowl. Their rice to meat portion seems just right to me! And of course, it tastes great!. . If you want to eat at Monta during the night, you have a really high chance of having to wait to be seated. Monta is pretty small and they can only seat so little at a time. If you're patient this place is worth the wait! Another thing, if you have a big party you should make sure that EVERYONE is present. If not they'll let another party go instead and wait til your party is all there.
This is one of two ramen joints in town that are worth visiting: Monta and Fukumimi. The tenderness of their pork belly is amazing and really makes the dish. Their tonkotsu (pork) broth is my favorite, especially if you get it with their special called kuro ramen (black ramen) which adds a black garlic sauce.. . Fukumimi doesn't have nearly as good char sui (braised pork belly slices) but I think their broth is slightly better.
This review is long overdue, but from what I remember, the service was quick, the broth was tasty, and the food was fairly inexpensive.  It's a really small restaurant, so prepare to wait if coming during the meal rush.
This place is amazing. One of the best ramen spots in Vegas. If you have the patience to wait the occasional long lines it's well worth it. It's a pre work meal for me on occasion. It's a same spot so you have to wait a while to get seated. I recommend this spot without a doubt.
Monta is the real deal, go here.. . The restaurant is pretty small and you can almost count that there will be a wait any time of day, in fact, when they open for lunch at 11 there is often a line already forming.. . OK the food:. -Miso Ramen is FANTASTIC,  it is my go to.The broth  is delicious and the noodles are chewy and plentiful, there is also the most tender sliced pork on top. You can also get extra items like more pork, butter, corn, sliced egg, all make your soup even better.. - Pork  Belly Over Rice is a winner, just like it sounds, the pork belly will melt in your mouth.. - Gyoza is the best I have ever had!!. . The atmosphere is nice and the service is quick and friendly.
Awesome pork - tender and flavorful. Broth a bit heavy. Considering it got shut down by health department a while back, I never went back. Very crowded, dark and cramped.
The best ramen in Las Vegas! Simple menu selection and very friendly staff. I recommend the pork belly bowl (best dish in the house) and the spicy Tonkotsu ramen. You won't be disappointed!!
I love this place!  Whenever I want ramen this is the only place I come.  Granted its very small and there is usually a wait for a table but the food is worth it. If you're on the other side of town they're is another location it's much bigger and still had the heat same food
Monta Ramen was the first ramen place I had ever been to in Las Vegas and my first experience with ramen that did not come in a bag or cup. I have been here many times since then and it is still one of my favorites ones. . . The restaurant itself is definitely small and often busy but it is always worth the wait. The tonkotsu is wonderfully porky and now you can get it spicy if that is your thing. My favorite part is the thin, dense noodles. There are days that I crave these noodles specifically and that is when I come to Monta.
The broth here is amazing.  I think the noodles could be better but thats probably a preference if you like the skinny noodles or the Thick noodles.  I'm preferential to the chewy kind.  Place is small so it makes it feel like you are in Japan.  Service is good...and what Japanese restaurant doesn't have good service....overall its not bad...just wish they had thicker noodles
My husband and I went pretty much as soon as we found out about this place, ramen junkies that we are. The thing is, I really wish this website allowed half star ratings, because I would have rated it 3 1/2. What really brings it down in my mind are the noodles. . The atmosphere was fine and the staff are friendly. But the noodles... They are too starchy and separated, and not very fresh-tasting. Frowny face.. The broth, however, was something else entirely. Our bowl of Tonketsu ramen was perfectly salty and flavorful, and the texture of the broth wasn't grainy or too fatty. . The other toppings and chashu pork were fine, but in my opinion, the chashu at Ramen Sora down the street is far superior.. All in all, it certainly wasn't a bad eating experience, but I didn't enjoy my noodles very much, and man can not live on broth alone.
Want a bowl of Ramen from Japan but don't want to fly there?. . Monta Ramen has you covered. . . I order what I consider their best Ramen. . . Their Miso Ramen  7.25. Miso ("bean paste") Ramen which was developed in Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious amounts of miso and is blended with oily pork broth to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup.. . Be sure to order it with extra Chashu Pork. It melts in your mouth. ($2.50). . Be prepared to wait for about 20-30 minutes at peak times.
