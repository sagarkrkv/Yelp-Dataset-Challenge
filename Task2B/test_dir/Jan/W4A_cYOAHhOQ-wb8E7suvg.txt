Overall good show. Some of the stunts were amazing. We sat in the first row and therefor saw many of the flaws which I don't think would be visible from a few rows back, plus we were getting splashed, but that wasn't too bad. The music quality is definitely 4-stars, maybe even 5, but this is really not my style. The visuals and lighting were amazing and the main actress is beautiful, eye-candy, very nice to look at. The show has a little bit of everything, stunts, athletics, funny, serious, beauty, love, lust, SEX, and magic. The only thing I didn't like was at times there was too much going on, hard to keep track. Enjoyable, but not sure this is a $110 per ticket show. If you get a good price, its may be worth it, nice theater too.
Bottom line: every last second was captivating. The acrobatics were stellar, but it also had amazing lighting, dancing and the set is an engineering  marvel. This stage transforms at very step of the game. . . Highlight: the divers were the best part of the show for me. . . Seating: it seemed to me there wasn't a bad seat in the house because is how the venue is designed.
It was beautiful. There were times when I felt overwhelmed because I didn't know where to look because there was so much going on. I liked the circular theater and how the show was performed so that every part of the theater felt like it was the best; it was a large theater but still felt very intimate. My friends had gone to see it the week prior and did comment that they did not expect quite so many scantily clad buff men, but I didn't really find this to be a big problem (surprise surprise). The set was amazing and impressive and the performers were wonderfully talented. Would definitely recommend this.
Sensational and awe-inspiring. Le Reve is a feast for the eyes and imagination.. . From the theatre and ambiance, to the incredible water stage, to the unparalleled acrobatic/aquatic/dance performances, this show is pure awesomeness. . . Everyone seems to be comparing Le Reve with Cirque Du Soleil performances and that's fair because these are among the best cirque-style performances in Vegas. I won't go on to explain all the differences (imp. note: Le Reve is NOT in the CDS family) but here are some things to keep in mind if deliberating between LR vs CDS: LR features less individual acrobatic performances than you may be wanting, nearly all acts revolve around aquatic elements like diving, synchronized swimming, etc, because it is an aquatic-themed show, story is a little more abstract than what you may be expecting, and it is just a little over an hour in length. With that being said, the performances in Le Reve are incredible. I felt that, even though there was so much going on, there was incredible coordination between every performer on stage which translates into extraordinary cohesion. The fact that there isn't a bad seat in the house helps with the experience, not to mention that with every act you absorb the full performance through the nature of the theatre. And though everything is aquatic, what a perfect unifier for the "dream"-like element they are looking to achieve through the show. In regards to the story being too abstract and not making sense, there is cohesion between the acts but the abstract feel is intended; they don't call it Le Reve The Dream for nothing. Also the duration was perfect, you're left celebrating and your senses recovering. Awesome show, highly recommended!
Great show with excellent stunts and effects.  However, I was confused on the ticket purchasing online, so not sure if I got the best tickets.  I am generally good about buying "concert" tickets online by looking at the venue, but I didn't have very good luck with this purchase.  I'm glad we went, but next time I'll purchase different seats now that I know the layout of the venue.
Le Reve was the third show in as many nights so it was at a disadvantage going in.  However, it proved to be absolutely magical and absolutely won me over with the sheer artistry and exuberance of the performers.. . First off, the theater - this alone is close to being worth the price of admission.  Never before have I seen such a masterpiece of design and aesthetic elegance.  It is a HUGE theater but feels more intimate than anything I've ever been to before.  Every seat in the house is a great seat (though some have champagne served LOL). . The show itself is absolute wizardry... beautiful, skilled performers living out the expression of a "dream."  There is no official plot or storyline that I am aware of - the beauty of the show is that you are free to interpret it as you see it, and appreciate the perfection of the execution as you go along.. . Talking about perfection, one thing that made this stand out a little from the Cirque shows I watched the previous night was the fact that it lacked just a bit in technical mastery...  while this may be seen as a knock, I saw it as a delightful manifestation of the really "human" experience and it actually endeared me more to the show.. . Performers, sets, stage, music, choreography, wild acrobatics, scintillating synchronized swimming... you name it, it's there.. . ~ 5 stars - I cannot recommend this enough - you owe it to yourself to watch Le Reve if you get a chance.  You will not regret it.  This, I promise.. . # 305
There is a reason why this is the best show in Vegas. Went there with my family and sat in the spalsh zone. It indeed is like a dream, I would love to give out more details but don't want to steal the thunder. All I will say is dont miss this show. . Even when sitting in the 1st row.of.spalsh.zone we hardly got wet, so dont carry any cover/rain protections.. just sit back and enjoy.
BEAUTIFUL SHOW ROOM. Every angle in the theater I think gives you just as beautiful look into the stage. Even before the show starts when you walk in it's just beautiful. There's a story to it so there's not just Technique and Looks. A must see in Vegas! I'm so glad I ignored those damn 1-2 stars review in Yelp... I have no freakin' idea who would say they fell asleep in this... Probably drunk people only enjoying lap dances.
I must say that this is the best show that I've seen in Vegas so far. I've seen Beatles LOVE and Zarkana, which were both very good, but Le Reve blew my mind away on a whole different level. My eye was irritated that night and I was a bit sleep going into to the later show (9:30pm), but throughout the show I did not want to rest my eyes at all. Every second there was something amazing happening and I just didn't want to miss it.. . Without spoiling the show for you by giving you all the details, I will say that this show definitely gets your emotions rolling. You may feel happy, sad, angry, scared, and excited throughout the whole show. Just as everyone mentioned before: there's not a bad seat in the house. I usually prefer sitting further back from the stage, but this time i sat four rows from the front to sit with my brother and his girlfriend and I still loved the show from my seat.. . Totally recommend this show if you haven't seen it yet!
Our 2nd time!  We saw the show last year and were just blown away by the beauty and every detail of the show - and - there were different elements from last year's show.. . Very well done!  An absolute must~
CORRECTION: . Not a cirque show!. However just as great and I was in major ahhh, astonishment, and amazement. The Dream kept up with my assumptions and overwhelmed me with talent and beauty. . I was gifted 2 tickets at work, section A, row D. It was a Sunday night, and the place was at about 65% capacity so we had no one on either side of us, which was nice. But the seats were big and comfortable enough that even had we had neighbors, it would have been fine. . You could feel the humidity as soon as you enter the circular room. It was not uncomfortable until the very end. The name "The Dream" fits the show perfectly as it takes on you on a journey through a young woman's dreams and possible fantasies and nightmares. Every person in the show is beautiful from head to toe. The movement in their bodies was extraordinary. And it can't be possible for them all to hold their breath that long under water can it? These performers have true talent. . Not to mention the round stage with the water surrounding it, lights and music from all angles. It was like a dream. Yet the story still followed a plot, and made sense. it was not too long, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. It didn't get slow or boring. Every little aspect brought some form of skill and magnificence. . Working in a high rise, this show can easily be recommended to locals, as well as tourists, and I will have people thanking me. I am lucky that I was able to go for free, I would have paid in a heartbeat!
It was a very unique show. Most of it is in, over and under the water. It was definitely a one of a kind performance that could not be duplicated in any other theater.
Amazing show! Visually stunning! The performers are so talented! We had VIP seats, so we had bottomless champagne, truffles, super plush seating, and small video screens at our feet showing backstage and underwater cameras. There is a concession stand inside the theater, in case you wanted beer, wine, soft drinks, or some of that AMAZING smelling popcorn. I would love to see it again!!
We were only in town for 2 nights, and purchased tickets to Le Reve for the first night.  A few hours beforehand, we received an email that it had been CANCELLED.  . . We called the service number immediately to reschedule for the second night.  The phone call took place over a quick 2 minutes, and the rep told us we were all set for the second night.  When we got to the theatre on the second night, we were told the show was CANCELLED AGAIN.  . . When we inquired about the reason behind the series of cancellations, a rep in ticket told us "engineering had concerns about equipment safety and still needed more time to work on it."  When we spoke with a supervisor named Lindabea later, she tried to refute that statement (and was also trying to cut us off when we tried to voice our concerns, by insisting that everything we experienced was no fault of Le Reve / Wynn). . More than just missing out on a performance, we were really disappointed at the opportunity cost!  In each case, the cancellation was so last minute that we couldn't get seats to another Cirque du Soleil show.  We were essentially "stood up" both nights at the Wynn and were not offered another show of equal entertainment value.  . . Most importantly, the question to ask Le Reve staff is:. Why release tickets for sale to a show if you know it's going to be unsafe?  Shouldn't engineering be testing their equipment regularly and making replacements and updates on a regularly basis to ensure top quality?  As soon as there is any suspicion that engineering isn't robust, shouldn't they stop releasing tickets to vendors?  . . I don't want to be supporting an unsafe show at any rate, so I hope otherscan find out more about this if they get a chance.
