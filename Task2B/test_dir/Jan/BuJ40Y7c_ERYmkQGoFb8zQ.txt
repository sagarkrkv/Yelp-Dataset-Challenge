We purchased our room on Hotels Tonight. The place was okay but not my favorite casino. If you advertise free wifi with your resort fee, don't only allow us to get it for one day for free. If that's the case, charge one day of resort fee. . . Check in was really long but I understand due to it being New Year's Eve but I thought they would have had more people on staff instead of two.
I give the hotel a 2- and there Tropicana Nights dinner Dee Skye a perfect 10, go here for the lounge NOT the hotel. My cousin spent thousands of dollars at Trop for her wedding, they didn't have any rooms ready for bride or guests upon late arrival, when I consulted the manager he first fought with me, as I demanded they comp the brides room after hideous service...then after he agreed to comp it, at check out they still had to pay...low class hotel. Poor service of the management staff. Only go for the amazing live music!
Unbelievably disappointing. The room is lovely and the staff was EXTREMELY nice, but the pool is a joke. The only reason we booked this hotel was because it was "the best pool in Vegas."  Not so. It looks like an apartment complex. There is a different pool area that looks like a Mediterranean paradise but....it's closed. This is what you see on the website. False advertisement....  It's owned by a private company and only available if you rent it for a private party.   Additionally, the pool for regular guests isn't heated. They claim it's broken, but it's been "broken" forever. Save yourself and stay somewhere else.
Stay was ok; at least my room was clean and didn't have an awful room experience like what other reviewers were talking about.  The worst part is the resort fee itself of $22.39 (fee + tax)/night which bumped their 3 star to 2 star.  It covers free wi-fi and use of fitness center.  I bought my hotel stay through Priceline, thought I was saving $ until I saw the resort fee.  It made my hotel "savings" not a savings at all.  Booo to that!  Some advice - stay at a better hotel for the same price on the strip other than Tropicana cuz they'll have better facilities and quality products.
Kinda bad location far from the center of the strip. If you don't mind waling this is a really nice place to stay. The rooms are very clean, the pool is beautiful. The casino is okay. I would say that if your looking for a nice pool to relax with swim up Blackjack and a nice lounge area this is the place to be.
By Las Vegas standard this hotel should be one star. The new Tropicana is "lipstick on a pig". The rooms had no sound barriers, you can hear your neighbor talking, flushing, and ....  The service is even worst. No one in this hotel has any idea what customer service and guest relation is about...so don't bother complaining.
Monday at 8pm and the food court is closed till Friday. The Beach Cafe is at least an hour wait for a table (as is room service), 30 minutes minimum for to-go orders.
The refreshed Trop would be great if they kept it up better .  For example, our room in the Paradise tower has two sets of carpet stains, water spots on the mirror, and toothpaste residue in the sink; juuust enough for us to wonder if the room's bed was only made up , and new towels put out only.  . The staff is truly nice here, yet ... There are so few of them! Example- Last night we ate late at the Beach cafe. One waitress, one bartender, one cook, that's it.  . . The Trop feels like an old, neat, historic Vegas hotel that got a cheap update; Hilton could do better with it. My final example is getting hit with the smell of cigarette smoke as you pass through only the first set of doors into the lobby; it gets stronger inside. . . Yet. The new decor is nice, the TV huge, the plantation shutters a great tough , the bed very comfy.  . . It seems to need do little.....
Had a really bad experience at check in that made me feel unwelcome.  The property itself was fine - clean and pleasant enough.  A good physical facility has to be staffed with people that have a service mentality and that work to establish an environment that is welcoming and warm.  The Tropicana has a ways to go to meet what I believe are reasonable service standards for the hotel they say they are.
The hotel is ok. The bathroom is by far drawback. The tub looks old and the ceiling above looks gross. The toilet "ran" all night keeping me half awake. I was too lazy to get up and play with it to shut it up! The rooms cut some noise, but we could still hear noisy neighbors.  We got this on Priceline- not sure I agree with the 4star rating.
As I grew up in Las Vegas I remember the Tropicana from back in the day. Never really had a need to go there since leaving for LA in 93. However, being a Hilton Diamond member for the last 11 years has me trying new Hilton property locations all the time. When I discovered that Doubletree had partnered with the Trop, I thought I'd give it a try. . . First thing I noticed is they had done some remodeling on the main casino floor and what I thought was a nice touch is the little kiosk style bar that is managed by a 3rd party. They have a separate reservation desk for Diamond members inside a secluded room that helps set the tone early. The three or so times I've stayed there I was pleased with the accommodations. Rather than go through what I didn't like, I will just say there was nothing that jumped out at me like, room smelled, stains on sheets, etc.. . The room is fairly modern and looking out at the pool from the balcony suggests to me it's pretty lively during the weekend when it's hot. I'm headed back again this week for business. Relatively good room value & centrally located, I would recommend to anyone looking for a mid-tier room while in Vegas.
When my husband and I first arrived we were excited because we had been on the road for 6 hours but when we arrived we were told we had to wait an additional 45 minutes because our room was not ready yet. We understood because we were told they were behind. . . Once we were assigned a room in the bungalow tower, we came to our room and it was freezing and when we called the front desk they sent someone over to look at the heater for us. When the man arrived he said he would not be able to do anything and we should ask for more blankets. . . There is no fridge or no coffee in this room. Overall, I am not satisfied with this hotel.
I stayed at the Trop during my Vegas Vacation this past week and had a decent experience.  The Lobby, floor, and side lounges/restaurants are pretty, but pail in comparison to other Strip hotels and come across as old and stuffy.  The Room was very nice overall and had quite large.  I was impressed with the bathroom size as well, although the tub felt a little small.  It came with a nice Bungalow couch as well as the King sized bed which is nice if you're traveling in packs I suppose.  . . Negatives:  Well that goddamn resort fee came of nowhere as I booked Expedia, but F me I guess everyone does that BS.  Speaking of BS, Wifi was not free as far as I could tell which SUCKS in the modern age, but again that's the Strip for you.  The bathroom had a couple of plumbing problems.  They were fixing the sink as we arrived but the damn Tub kept getting backed up with 6 inches of water when we showered which was odd.  We gambled a bit on the machines but got our asses handed to us and never hit anything better then a Straight on Video Poker over the course of an Hour, so not too jazzed about that.  Too far of a walk from the nicer places on the strip as well :/.. . Overall it's a decent place to visit if you want to save a buck on your hotel, but I don't think I'll be coming back again.
Everyone that's been to Vegas has seen the Tropicana. It's one of those "classics". Personally, I like the newer hotels, but we had a work event here, so didn't really have a choice. People kept telling me it's actually pretty nice now, given that they have gone through a major renovation. It is now called "The New Tropicana". I was skeptical, but didn't have a choice. I decided to suck it up and give it a chance. . . I soon learned that this is one of those hotels that really pisses me off. The "new" part is just a facelift. I'll explain.... . Upon arriving, I liked that the hotel is so close to the airport. It is a smaller hotel, so less hassle with the cab drop-off. Upon paying the cab, I started to head into the hotel only to find that they actually have stairs at the entrance. Um...I just arrived on a flight and have my carry-on. I have to now drag it up stairs? Thanks! There are only like 5 stairs, but still. I saw that there was a ramp at the very end that looped around and disappeared to the side, so I figured it was just easier to lift the bags up the stairs. . . The lobby was nice and white and clean. The check-in desk was also really nice with everything white and neon backlights. It looked promising! I checked in using the Hilton Honors line, but turned out it was slower than the main line. Oh well. The lady checked me in and I headed to the room. It was in the Club Tower, which was all the way on the other side of the hotel. At least it was close to the conference center. . . However, turns out that housekeeping was just getting to my room to clean it. The attendant was puzzled as to why they would check me into that room, since she had just got to it, hadn't cleaned it yet, and it wasn't cleared for check-ins. She couldn't call the front desk for me. I didn't feel like dragging my luggage back and asking for another room. So I asked housekeeping to let me keep my luggage there and I would come back whenever she was done - 30 minutes. . . Upon returning, the room was clean. It looked fine enough. The main door didn't close by itself since it grazed up against the latch. You had to push it shut. And I had to remember to do that on my way out. The room was like a typical Doubletree hotel - nothing great, but decent. It didn't have any Vegas flair, but I was there for work. . . Things went downhill from there. The next morning, after showering, I grabbed a towel, only to be utterly disgusted. I felt sick to my stomach as I realized that the towel had blood stains on it!! I was in a rush to get to my work meetings, so I grabbed another towel, which thankfully was clean, and used that. I didn't have time to call and complain, but I wrote a note and took a picture, which I will upload here. I was left with a gross feeling all day. . . The work day was long, and I got back to my room late. The next morning, after the shower, I grabbed a towel, and was using it. Half way through, I notice it had big black stains! AGAIN?!?! Sure, it's my fault for not checking before using, but is that the expectation of a hotel guest?? Even after I had left a note for housekeeping the prior day, couldn't they have double checked when they restocked the towels? I left another note and was again disgusted. I went to the front desk to complain. I showed them the pictures. The lady apologized and made a call to housekeeping. I was there during a break and had to rush back to a work meeting, so couldn't wait for her to finish her call, but there was no talk about compensating me for the two back to back days of disgusting towels. WTF? . . Additionally, the stupid message light on the phone in my room was always flashing. However, when I picked up the receiver and pressed the Check Messages button, it just went to a busy signal. I tried this many times. I'm not a light sleeper so the light didn't bother me, but I'm sure it would bother other guests. . . Sorry for the long review, but after these incidents I'm never staying at this place again. The facelift didn't do anything to change the underlying problems of customer service. Having a guest feel disgusting all day because of the uncleanliness of the place is a simple way to lose your customers...especially without doing anything to make up for it.
