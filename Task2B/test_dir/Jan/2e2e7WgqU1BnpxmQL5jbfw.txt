I had the most delicious holiday turkey sandwich here! The line was long, but it moved very fast! The price was fair(for Vegas). The flavors of the sandwich worked perfectly together. So yummy!! I will definitely be back!
This location is pretty awesome! They have a huge menu and the service is fast and friendly! My favorite item is the All American or during the fall The Holiday! Their soups, desserts, salads, and beverages are all delicious and it's always tricky trying not to eat everything when I'm there!
Perfect size sandwiches! We had the tomato soup, tuna melt, and original 1762 (which I would highly recommend!). Delish!
The line looked pretty long when we first come but the food was prepared quite quickly. I would definitely recommend the cannonballs and hawaiian bbq! They taste amazing!! The other sandwiches taste pretty good too. I would say you can't go wrong ordering any kind of sandwiches here. The wraps are not that great though. That's why I give this place a four star.
cheap good sandwich. what's not to like about it. wouldn't say I loved it though. I'd get it if I was not hungover enough to not be able to chew my food.
It seems that the drunken people of las Vegas are 5 star horders. . . 1st: today was the worst food I had @ The Sugar Factory. . Now I paid for an overpriced piece of bread with some mysterious meat they were trying to pass by as roast beef. . . No no no Avoid at all cost
This place has thousands of reviews and Yelpers seem to like it. But I just don't get it. We checked reviews before going so we were expecting something good, at least better than Quiznos, which it is not. I am guessing that people like it because it is a cheap option compared to other prices on the strip. But for my money, Quznos is better. Even Subway. Jersey Mike's leaves this place in the dust. . . I got the jerk chicken sandwich and not only was the sandwich small, and I mean really, really small, but there was hardly any chicken and although tender, it was not jerk. I also got chicken noodle soup and for $3.49 the tiny little container was a total ripoff. Plus, the soup was bland bland bland. It was by far the worst chicken soup I have ever had. I left no less hungry than when I arrived. . . The wife opted for oatmeal, and it was instant from a package. The only saving grace was the banana nut muffin, which appeared to be homemade.. . The entire ordering process is chaotic and confusing. You can order some things at the order station but most of our order had to picked up along the line, which led to massive confusion when it came time to pay, so I ended up with three receipts. . . Overall, I cannot imagine how anyone can go above 3 stars for this place. I could give it 3 because of the muffin, but in reality my sandwich and soup were 2 star quality and the overall experience was not pleasant.. . Would not return for anything.
My three star review is a byproduct of being totally sandwich spoiled, living in the Big Apple. Sandwichs are everywhere, quickly prepared and a weekly staple on my food intake desires. Earl of Sandwich has quite an operation as workers at their stations work furiously in their assembly and preparations. . . Once I observed the line, I could not contemplate eating any sooner than 30 minutes as there were a good fifty people ahead of me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be ordering in ten minutes and eating ten minutes after that. (There must have been 15 people prepping, an army of preppers in comparison to Subway . . The Italian sub was thin on ingredients, not very exciting. Probably a poor choice by me, a NY Italian to order that item even though expectations were at a minimum. Chipolte Chicken Avacado was a nice twist, spicy, creamy with nice chunks of tender chicken breast. Throw in a banana for a buck and you have a fairly good, on the go eating experience. Go check out the Earl if your in the area, you won't disappoined.
I tried the Original Roast Beef and the Tuna Melt... its a pretty good sandwich! I love the fresh baked ciabatta bread. Cheap, good eats on the strip.
They took away my favorite sandwich which forced me to try something different. Now it's just a sandwich shop. It's a good place to grab a quick good meal on the strip for a reasonable price, but nothing to go out of your way for.
We were in Vegas at Halloween and looking for filling, tasty, affordable-eats. I Yelp-searched food near our hotel (The Cosmo) and Earl popped up. It was right across the street (well, Vegas style, out the second floor entrance, across the High-rise crosswalk, and down into the other casino across the street.) Our food service was fairly quick once our order was placed. It filled our bellies for the nightlife. I'd eat here again.
Very good sandwiches! I had the caprese and it was fresh and amazing. I would eat here again for sure. Don't be intimidated by the line it goes by fast!
I love their sandwiches best in town ...
The sandwiches are good but not great. Portions were a lot smaller than I expected. Boyfriend got the jerk chicken sandwich; I have no idea why they call it jerk chicken, when there was no cajun seasoning on it whatsoever. Very heavy on the peppercinis.  The potato salad was delicious, but the mac and cheese was forgettable. I've made better. Given the hype, I had very high expectations and left very disappointed. Maybe I'm spoiled by the SF foodie scene; I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches. This place doesn't even come close to Ike's. If you people ever visit California, go to Ike's for a real sandwich.
Every other time before this current trip to Vegas I would have given Earl's 5 stars. Let me explain...I am a regular here in Vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. Earls is my go to place every single time. One being they are right within the hotel I stay at (Planet Hollywood/Elara), two being they are 24 hours, and number reason being they are the best sandwiches on earth! the tuna melt and Hawaiian BBQ are my top choices while I do very much enjoy all the other kinds! Trust me I want to give this place five stars but here is what got me to give only 4. This current trip that I'm on I haven't had the best experience...apparently since they are open 24 hours they need to "refresh" their system (registers and what not)which is totally understandable. BUT they pick the worse time to do that...12 am, the time that most are heading to earls! And it causes this 10-15 minute wait which feels like forever when you're hungry!!!!!!!!!!! Another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. I find myself constantly having to repeat my Order cause it seems like they don't pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and I notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready! And it can get very frustrating! Despite the delay sandwiches seems to have gotten smaller as far as the filling it's much more less than it use to be. Over all yes I will continue to be a regular here and always be. I love love love love earls here at the Planet Hollywood but there can definitely be improvements!!!!
Good sandwiches and soup, I like em toasty what can I say
Good choice for a breakfast with free wifi. Sandwich is reasonably priced. I ate ham and cheese.
One of my favorite Sandwich shops between Las Vegas and California! Cheap, fresh, and delicious. Love there turkey, cranberry one(They did not have stuffing one night when I ordered very late and it was still incredibly delicious!)
Delicious sandwiches, and one of the best-of-the-overpriced options in Casino food court dining.
If you are drunk and you're in Vegas, heck, even if you're not drunk and in Vegas, this IS the place to be. . . Just try any sandwich and it will taste like heaven because 1) it's probably the cheapest thing you can get in vegas even cheaper than cheap hookers lol just kidding 2) the best drunk hot sandwich you will ever taste and 3) the best next-day hangover sandwich because you didn't finish it the night before . . I recommend the club or the chipotle sandwiches. . . The only downside is that the lines are ridiculous. But you will be with friends so the time in line will go by pretty fast.
Their sandwiches are delicious! I'm glad they specialize in hot sandwiches...I've always thought it kind of silly to go to a restaurant to get a boring cold sandwich. At other sandwich shops, if they ask me if I want it toasted, the answer is always YES! Anyhow, I digress. My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. A lot of flavor and the meat is juicy.. . Good news: Since this location is right in the heart of the Strip in Planet Hollywood, it's open 24 hours.. Bad news: Since this location is right in the heart of the Strip in Planet Hollywood, it can get crowded during busy hours.. . Tip: Sign up for their mailing list. You can get a free sandwich for your birthday.
Best sandwiches, hands down. . I usually write lengthy reviews, but I can't even begin to describe this place. Just try it.
The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich was amazing! Before it even entered my mouth, the smell was telling me this is going to be amazing.
Typical sandwich place. It was a good sandwich though. They had a pretty long line and limited seating. Great for a hangover if you don't feel like eating that greasy cheeseburger! I guess this is a chain, but this is the first time we have seen it. We would eat again if we see this place somewhere down the road.
I'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!. . I came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. . . Let me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!. . So on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. . . Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: "We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap".. . I stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! . . I spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. . . Walking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.. . By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding "WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!". . Mr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), "Corporate happened.". . When I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.. . And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!
Boom! Just as everyone else has said and what landed us here. You must go if your around and want a nice fresh sandwich. FYI, limited room for how packed it is so just be prepared. Nough said
If you're looking to get as full as possible from one sandwich, this is not the place for you.. . However, if you want a great tasting sandwich at any time of the day, this is the place to go! The sandwiches may be somewhat small, but the quality is noticeable. I enjoy going here with friends for a light meal when I do not feel like pigging out. Definitely try The Full Montagu sandwich. It will not disappoint.. . The desserts are pretty tasty too, which was surprising. I recommend sharing the desserts, because they can get a little too sweet for one sitting.. . The area is very open with the rest of the hotel, so it is easy to talk with friends without too much background noise. It's great for a quick, cheap group outing.
How can you not like a sandwich on ciabatta bread?!?!  I got the Caribbean Jerk and it was fabulous.  The sauce isn't what I would think of as a Caribbean Jerk sauce, but I didn't care because it was soo good.  I'm not sure how they toast their sandwiches, but it stayed warm throughout for a long time.
Not sure what the rave about this place.  Decent sandwich at a decent price.  . . 3 Stars.  Chances are I'll be back but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
Surprisingly the prices aren't bad being that it's in a casino. We ate lunch and breakfast there and both were very good. Breakfast sandwich and coffee for $4.99.
A must have when ever you are in Vegas! Open 24/7 can't get better than that! Come here every time I'm in Vegas they should open one in the bay area!
Fantastic Sandwich fresh and very good.  Would definately recommend, better than the average place.
Drunkinglydelicious!!
While staying at Planet Hollywood this week, Earl of Sandwich has turned out to be a very convienient, quick, cheap, and healthy-ish place to eat. It's located right beside the casino and offers a bunch of very very yummy sandwiches, which are great to get to go, to take up to your room.. . I would highly recommend the turkey/stuffing/cranberry sandwich...Soooo yummy.. . Had the mac and cheese...wasn't really too fond of it at all, so I'd avoid that next time.. . All in all though, a very great place to grab a quick bite!
High expectations & setup for failure. We had three extremely ordinary sandwiches.... Capriotti's Bobbie is significantly better than my "holiday feast" pressed turkey.... The original was bland with all the horseradish pushed to one end of the bun
This place was just ok for me. Long line to order food but it went fast. The dining area was packed but we were able to find seats for the two of us right away. They are good about cleaning up the tables as soon as people leave. . . I ordered the chicken avocado wrap which was good but nothing special. My husband ordered the Full Montague. He said that was very bland. . . I would give them another try but wouldn't go out of my way.
This place still never disappoints.  After a fun and drunk night out, any of their sandwiches will hit the spot.  The Earl's Club is always my go-to sandwich.  It is even better with the steak sauce they have on their tables.. . Go get your bricks of gold now!
Really tasty sandwhiches, lots of options and the sides are made in house daily. My favorite would have to be the earles club sandwhich. Open 24hrs between 3pm -5pm seem to be there busiest times.
I ate here for the first time and my friend brought me back a chicken sandwich and it was ok. But when I went back again and had their tuna melt, it was AMAZING!! I already wish I could go back Vegas, just to eat the tuna melt.
I absolutely adore this place! I'm definitely not a sandwich person and don't go out go out of my way to get one, but every time I'm in Vegas, I make a stop by this place(even though there's one in downtown disney). . . Pros:. HUGE VARIETY OF SANDWICHES . Yummy soup & salad options. Reasonable prices. Line can be long, but it moves fast. Located close to Fat Tuesdays (;. . Cons:. Lines are long almost at every time in the day(I can get impatient). I wish portions were a TAD larger(maybe I'm a fatty). Needs more seating for amount of people that come here. . I've tried a variety of their sandwiches and my favorite are the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Tuna Melt. They are so mouth watering, I can't wait to go back to vegas to eat here again! I also love their seasonal Thanksgiving leftover sandwich(turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy, stuffing, the works) and limited edition Philly cheesesteak! Def. try their limited/seasonal sandwiches when you get the chance! Their cheddar and broccoli soup is also delicious!. . Earl's, I will be coming back to you someday because I've never been so excited for a sandwich in my life. EVER.
This was such a great find during my Las Vegas trip over the weekend.  Located in Planet Hollywood, the lines were long during lunch but it moved quickly.  The ordering process is quick and painless and finding a seat can be a tad bit hard during their peak hours but never impossible.   We ordered the All American sandwich, Full Montagu, Chicken Wrap, and the Berry Salad.  . . The All American Sandwich was absolutely delicious and flavorful with roast turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and cranberries.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the cranberry added an extra sweetness to the sandwich which made it a little bit more heavenly.   Please order this during your first time here. . . The Full Montagu sandwich was good but not great.  Consisted of beef, turkey, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard sauce.   The meat was a bit under-seasoned and the whole sandwich tasted a tad bit bland and light.  The Chicken, Berry, and Almond salad was good.  The whole combination of almond, berry, chicken, and lettuce was good.  The vinaigrette that comes with it was also decent and I would probably order it again if I needed a side of salad to balance out my meal. . . This place definitely does not specialize in salad nor wraps so I would stick with the hot sandwiches when I come back.  This is an order-and-find-your-own-seat type of place so don't expect quality service... but DO expect great sandwiches.
Went here while I am in Vegas and itwas delicious.  Prices were very fair for being on the strip, around $7 for a great sandwich.  I had the club and it was one of the best I have ever had.  Service was more then adequate,  location was good and easy to find.
Be patient. The line moves quickly.  Every sandwich I've tried has been amazing.  My favorite is the Earl's Club.
Love this place although there can be long lines at times but over all the sandwiches are great! Not to mention the one I go to is located inside the Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas strip so that makes it a fun experience  also
Ok, the sandwiches here were not bad, but I had a really poor customer service experience.. . We ordered 3 sandwiches, Carribean Jerk Chicken, Earl Sandwich Club, and a Chicken Avocado. Two of the orders came in correctly, but the third did not have any avocado and we were not even sure it was the right sandwich. Our receipt showed the order was correctly entered, so we brought it up to the attention of the cashier, along with our sandwich.. . The gentleman took a quick glance at our sandwich and told the server in the kitchen to grab 2 slices of avocado and then handed it to us. We were stunned.... . In most situations like these, typically a restaurant would offer to make a new sandwich, or at a bare minimum, at least acknowledge their mistake (i.e. "sorry sir, we got you the wrongsandwich"). They were also extremely stingy with 2 slices of avocado - I have no idea how many are supposed to come with the actual Chicken Avocado because we never got one ;). . The sandwiches that were made right were tasty, but also smaller in portions compared to a Quiznos or Subway for the expensive $6.49 price (no drink, no chips).
We love Earl of Sandwich. Our favorites are tomato bisque soup (with croutons) and the tuna melt. Their baked goods are also very tasty. Breakfast sandwiches are good but small.
Note: we only get these sandwiches while catering food, so I'm not sure how the sit-down service is.  But honestly, when feeding 40 hungry auditors, this place is great.  The original, the club, the roast beef, and etc are staples to our diet.  And leftovers are no problem, since the sandwiches are pretty shelf-stable and are good the next day.  The bread isn't soggy and nasty, as you would expect.. . We will definitely be ordering once a week again this year...
Pretty good sandwiches. The Holiday turkey is by far the best, and it's on the menu all year!!! I decided to try something new and ordered the chipotle chicken this trip and it was whatever. This is a good place to stop and get a quick meal before going out when you're in Vegas. Solid 4 stars for the holiday turkey, one star off for the 45 minute line.. . ****IMPORTANT NOTE**** . My recommendation is to go to the OTHER EARLS LOCATION on the strip, as the line at this one is RIDICULOUS. That one is WAYYYY less busy since most people don't know it exists
As far as a deli chain goes, EOS is just about as good as it gets. Great bread, quality meats. The Planet Hollywood location seems better than the Palms location.
Ordered the Italian sandwich. It had ham and salami and tomatoes. Overall it was pretty good. It had a lot of flavor. Not filling but it tasted good. Earls is generally a good place to eat before going out. . . Personally im a bigger fan of capriottis. But I'll be back here.
i guess as good as it gets for fast food. very delicious sandwiches and salads. havent really gave anything else a try. i usually just play it safe and get the hot ham and swiss with a greek salad. salad could use feta cheese and the bread is usually a little soggy from all the juices. either way top of the line when your at the palms. Its actually better than any of the food in the palms. they have gone totally down in my mind.
my kind of golden ticket. these golden bricks are probably my must in vegas. its cheap and fast and its GOOD. i would take earls over any $$$$ restaurant for ONE meal lol. what makes earl's earl's is their BREAD. their bread is so amazing. its so soft, yet so crisp. hot sandwiches are the best. the line seems to be long, but it goes by pretty fast. do not let this scare you!! table is first come, first serve. so be on the lookout!! or you can just take your sandwiches up to your room. . . full montagu - three different types of meat. this is one of my favorites. its very filling since there are so many ingredients. . . caribbean jerk - my favorite. be careful, this can be spicy to some people. i on the other hand, loooooove it! . . hawaiian - go to favorites for those who love pineapples. . tuna melt - it wasn't anything amazing, not my favorite, but still good.. . tomato soup - meh it was alright. i won't get it again though. just stick to their sandwiches.. . but again, i repeat, earls is their bread so any sandwich will be good.
The only place in vegas where I ate and didn't feel like my wallet had been unjustly ripped of all its content. Priced at about 7 bucks a sandwich, the food here was really great!. . My friend ordered me a traditional Italian Sandwich, then we traded and I got half of her Avocado Chicken something Sandwich. Man, her sandwich was good..... I wish I got more of hers but I wanted to be a gentleman and refrained myself. My Italian was not bad either --- made with the perfect texture and really nice bread!. . My other friends got soup and Mac&Cheese from there as well, and all of them left very satisfied :) In all, I think I enjoyed eating here the most out of all the places I went at Vegas. Wheee SAVE YO' MONAYY HERE!!! :D
Soooooo close to being 4 stars, but who makes a Philly cheesesteak with a single slice of roast beef?! Not my idea of a legit cheesesteak.... . There is so much hype surrounding this sandwich shop. Between this location and the one at Downtown Disney, I knew I had to check it out. So after checking into our hotel during my birthday weekend in Vegas, we met up with friends to eat here and I was excited. It was lunchtime but the wait in line was reasonable, and gave us time to decide exactly what we wanted.. . With so many options to choose from (sandwiches, soups, salads), it was like an elevated version of Subway (with actual Subway prices, not elevated Vegas Subway prices). The sandwiches were good, and the bread was perfectly toasted and flavorful, but I was so disappointed in my cheesesteak sandwich. Couldn't they at least have chopped up the roast beef to be the same consistency as a real cheesesteak? My boyfriend and I split that with an Italian sandwich, which I liked better. . . I kept hearing how good the tomato bisque is here, and kicked myself for not ordering that as well to try it out. Looks like a 2nd visit to this establishment is definitely warranted...
I wanted to provide an update. Following my review, Earl of Sandwich customer service did contact me and are offering restaurant cards good for a free sandwich as compensation for my poor experience.. . I do appreciate the team to make it right!
I want to give Earl of Sandwich 5 stars. I really want to. It was good, but I didn't think it was orgasmically good. Perhaps all the hype and high expectations made me feel like I would be eating a slice of heaven.. . I had The Original 1972 and it was delicious. It was a great sandwich for sure but I couldn't really understand what the hype was all about. My theory: People love it because the rest of the food in Vegas is either way too expensive or if it is affordable, then it probably sucks. As other Yelpers have mentioned it was definitely the most affordable and tasty meal in Vegas. . . I was also intrigued by their Earl Grey Lemonade but they ran out of it when I was there.. . Would I come back again? For sure. It beats paying $20+ for a crappy Vegas buffet!
Seriously can't go wrong with the Earl's Club. Turkey, bacon, cheese, yum. And for this kind of price in Vegas... You have to come for your first and last meal in the city.
LOVE the Thanksgiving sandwich - I'm obsessed with it, actually! I really wished we had one in SCV! Even if I'm not hungry and there's one nearby, I will pick up one of those bad boys and take it home for later!
I have eaten here 2-3 times while I lived in Las Vegas and it was good but, by far not the best sandwich around and probably not in the realm of best chain sandwich. I would prefer Quizno's anytime before this. I do enjoy hot sandwiches over cold ones so they got that. I think a lot of the crazy reviews for this place are from tourists from small towns that maybe that can only compare it to Subway or Jimmy John's. If you are in Vegas take a cab and go to Capriotti's or Pop's.
As per my other Earl of Sandwich review I wasn't blown away by this location, not sure if it was because it was 4 am in the morning, my foot had blisters from clubbing or it was just the long line and really average food. But I remember ordering something here and eating it and thought to myself that it lacked flavor in its entirety and the only thing worth mentioning was how awesome the bread was, it had the right fluffiness and it was soft and just melted in your mouth. It was the only great part about the sammich I had. :(. . But definitely a second chance is deserved as I wasn't in my best mood when I went the first time. Lol.
Best sandwiches ever. Period. Must eat there! I took some people from Australia there & told them they were the best in the world and they looked at me all dumb then when they ate it they were speechless haha. This place is sooooo good!!!
