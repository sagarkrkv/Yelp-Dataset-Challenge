Joe's Farm Grill is charming.  The outside setting is awesome....picnic tables everywhere and seating inside as well.  Although I felt like I was in school waiting in the cafeteria line to order my food, it took a little while to get my order in but the food was worth the wait.  The menu options are great from burgers to grilled pizza's and awesome salads I was very impressed and had a hard time choosing what to get.  I chose the farmer because while waiting in line saw so many go by....I couldn't help myself.  I was thinking salad, salad, salad.  The farmer burger was delicious!  . . Please note they do not serve beer or wine or they would get a 5 star rating.. . Enjoy!
Used to be very, very good, but lately quality, consistency and service seem to have slipped.    . . Today We ordered two burgers and a pizza.  After waiting a long while and seeing lots of folks who ordered after us getting their food (including burgers and pizza) I went to to the pick up window where I could see the burgers and fries sitting and cooling while waiting for the pizza.    After several more minutes when the pizza finally made its appearance I asked for and got fresh fries but the burgers were now barely warm and not very enjoyable.  One we had ordered "not pink" was decidedly pink. . . On a previous visit I ordered a Chicken Ciabatta which was edible only after I scrapped off mounds of raw garlic and went back to get additional marinara sauce so it wasn't so dry.. . We used to be huge fans, but if this had been our first visit it certainly would have been our last.  Pretty sad, considering how excellent it used to be.  Somebody needs to be paying attention to what is going on in the kitchen. Can't recommend it these days.
This place is fantastic. I've been here for brunch and lunch, and the food is always really good and really fresh. Most recently, I had waffles and bacon. So. Good. . . The location and ambiance are also great. I like to think of it as the quintessential Gilbert restaurant: family friendly, with that farm atmosphere. There's plenty of outdoor seating, and it feels like you're eating at the park or in someone's spacious backyard. Across the street there are some community gardens that I recommend strolling through.
I don't understand all the hype around this place. Yes it was on TV, but so what? . . Each time I go I am disappointed by something. For example, the salmon is typically undercooked and lacking seasoning. I love salmon so I tried it a few times hoping it would improve, but it didn't. Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible. . . They also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.  . . In my opinion, the food at the Coffee Shop next door is much better.
One of the best restaurants in the East Valley! Literally, love everything, but my favorite:  Portobello Mushroom Sandwich! omgosh!!
Fontina burger is where it's at. The BBQ chicken salad is pretty tasty as well. It's a great family place but is also an easy and quick date night for young couples. My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times together and it's always consistent and delicious!
Great atmosphere, better food. Cool setting for any occasion and did I mention the food is great. Had a good burger, chili dog bomb, pizza solid and breakfast menu is great. Worth the hype!
Absolutely incredible this place is. The food is so fresh they grow it mostly on the farm there. Sashimi grade tuna sandwich was out of this world. Great place to bring out of town guests.
This place is amazing, the food is truly straight off the farm. It is so fresh and you can actually see where they grow the food. . . It takes a bit to get your food, that's because you use them prep and actually make your food, instead of it being pre-made processed crap. . . I will defiantly becoming back soon!
Ok, so Joe's Farm Grill has amazing food.  No question about it.  However, five-star-food is quickly becoming a diminished three-star experience as I have now stood in line for 45 minutes while coming to realize they have not even decided to open the second register.   I find it rude.  Please, Farm Grill respect your customers by opening another register.  That is poor planning on your part.
Food not worth the wait. Stood in line for 50 minutes just to order. Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line. Mentioned just how busy they have been. Saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation. Yep, the entire time only one of their two order windows was open. One.  I guess I'm the sucker and the joke's on me.
Good burgers, fresh ingredients from the Agritopia garden. Anything with their homemade blue cheese sauce or barbecue is amazing! The Dog Days of Summer hot dogs are very good -- just wish you could get them year round.
Fast food quality, with high end restaurant wait times.. . My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where "maybe" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.. . Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.. . I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining.
