I had a great experience here with my friends and family.  We were a larger group with a reservation.  We arrived a few minutes early, but we were promptly seated.  . . We were greeted by our waitress who was more than willing to offer suggestions that were quite reliable based upon the smiles on our faces by the end of the meal.  When we asked about wine, she made some recommendations, but also she had their wine guy, Bernardo come over and greet us.  He was fantastic.  He spoke well and made great recommendations for a group of six with very distinct tastes.. . Our meals were served in a timely fashion.  We were surprised that the items that were made medium rare were barely warm, but we figured that was part of the way food was served here.  The flavors in each of our dishes were amazing.  Nobody left disappointed.
Delicious. Very overpriced for the appetizers, however, the flavors are incredible. Oh Bobby Flay...you are good at what you do...wish you would start cooking Asian style though where portion sizes can feed 20, when there are only four at the table. . . Appetizer: Duck Pancake. - tender meat, sweet and spicy taste. - small portion, wished the dish at least came with two pancakes. . . Entrees: Rib eye and chicken. . The rib eye was flavorful, however, the meat carried a lot of fat and my bf isn't a big fan. The rib eye was glazed with this spicy and sweet sauce. Yep, seems as though Mr. Flay likes those combos and rightfully so! . . I had the chicken and pesto mashed potatoes with a side of walnut, pomegranate and vinaigrette brussels sprouts. All of it. ALLL OF ITT was incredibly  delicious. The chicken was cooked just right and the sauce that it was smothered in had a bold flavor full of the right spices. My favorite part of the meal was the side of brussels sprouts. Just when you thought it was going to be overpoweringly sweet the bitterness of the Brussels sprouts come stomping in. Holy crap... it was so good. . . Drinks: Patron margarita . - average, nothing spectacular. At the price of $13...pass next time. . . Dessert: banana cream hazelnut pudding pie. - no words can truly describe how good this simple dish was. The pudding had hazelnut. That's enough info for you. Order it and thank me later. .  . Free stuff: bread . Don't think this is just an obvious "duh, bread is always free." Get ready to have your mind blown at the tasty bread basket sample your waiter brings you. The jalapeno cornbread with a sliver of melted butter...BOMB.  . . Only downside of the dinner was the chair. Someone placed a giant piece of gum on the edge of my chair....ended up on the back of my calve. Gross. Very. Very. Gross.
Food was incredible!!! Salmon was cooked to perfection. The service was a bit slow, due to it being New Years weekend. Highly recommend the chocolate cajeta cake for dessert!!
Amazing food. Great take on southwest food. The tiger shrimp tamale appetizer was excellent. We also had the green chili burger and Chicken skewer both of which were really good. Topped off with signature margaritas and excellent service. This made for a fantastic lunch.  Highly recommended!
The Shrimp tamales are fantastic. The prk sandwich was picture perfect and delicious. The nice big surprise is the Bread basket is FANTASTIC. The pumpkin cranberry coffee cake is one of the best coffee cake I have had. The service is fantastic and over the top. They are friendly, clean, fast and delicious. Will come here again!!!
The wait for a table was probably worth it but we opted to eat at the bar. Bobby Flay's restaurant is pure perfection.. . First time trying rabbit and that was excellent!!! And the chile relleno's presentation is unlike anything... The lobster tacos for appetizer was brilliant too. The cactus pear margaritas had the color of cactus pear but tasted just like a regular margarita which I didn't mind but I was really hoping for cactus pear flavor. . . So great. LOVED IT HERE!!
This is my favorite place for lunch on the Strip. It's not a cheap lunch, but frankly, it's only a few bucks more than you'll pay elsewhere. At least Mesa Grill will be delicious and memorable. You should be able to just walk up for lunch unless it's a crazy busy time in Vegas. I'd recommend reservations for dinner.. . The burgers! Margaritas! Everything is great. This is also a great dinner spot, too. I love the rub on the burgers and steaks. The location is right next to the the Caesars sports book. If you're seated right, you might be able to watch a game on the sports book TVs through the glass.
Tonight was my third visit to MesaGrill. My past two experiences here were five-star but tonight I rate it four for two reasons: 1. when we arrived the hostess was unfriendly and appeared put off that we were there. We had an 8:00 reservation and checked in at 7:45 and were told to "try coming back closer to your 8:00 reservation time." Definitely not a good idea to have that reception be your customer's first impression. 2. I asked for the salmon well-done and it arrived rare. I know medium to rare is the desired temp but I'm paying $32 and should get it the way I prefer. We also had the pork tenderloin, never a wrong choice. Don't pass on the coconut layer cake. We were seated at a small table right on the main walkway; good for looking into the kitchen, but awful for all the patrons passing by. Our server, Joel was friendly and very attentive, making our seating situation tolerable. If not for the pork, coconut cake, and Joel I would have rated this two stars.
So I have to start by saying I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay's....shows. As for the food, well...I would have to say good but with the variety of options to choose from in Vegas and our limited time there (4 days) I feel like my visit to the Mesa Grill wasn't worth it.. For appetizers we decided to share the Yucatan Chicken Skewers, it was 3 with 2 flour tortillas and one lettuce wrap. Pretty decent start to the meal. For entrees I ordered the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK, hubby ordered the CASCABEL CHILE CRUSTED RABBIT. I asked the waiter how I should have the tuna steak prepared and she said medium however it came out way over done for a medium, kind of a gray squishy mess :( And there was absolutely no mango or spice :( Husband liked his rabbit though. We also ordered a side of the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Pomegranates + Toasted Walnuts. My first time eating brussel sprouts and I guess it was the hot item of the night because the couples on both sides of us ordered it. Overall, it was an ok meal in my opinion, a tad overpriced, I believe for just the food (no drinks or dessert) we were at $125. Would I go again, probably not, although that doesn't mean I won't stop watching him on TV.
Needed to try the pork tenderloin after all the hype, and it didn't disappoint.  Medium is perfectly cooked so that it's tender and just right, not unsafe.  It was delicious and full of complex flavors - spicy, but a little sweet, a little tang, and a lot of goodness.  You wouldn't really notice it, because it's cut into 3 portions, but it's pretty filling too.
Ah, finally I get to come here and try out some Bobby Flay goodness. We walked in on a Monday afternoon and it was surprisingly empty for the most part. . . We ordered:. . Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OH MY GOD so good. The perfectly cooked shrimp with the sweetness of the corn mixed with the creaminess of the tamales and sauce was pure bliss to my taste buds. I almost wanted to order another for my entree. . . Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno: Nice smoky flavor with a spicy kick to it. The cornmeal added a nice crust that contrasted well with the eggplant and gooey cheese inside. . . New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: Disappointing. The pork was tough, dry and lacked flavor. Nothing in it stood out and my husband only ate half of the sandwich. . . There were some issues with the seating that tainted our overall experience. We brought it up to the management and they did their best to make it up to us. Unfortunate situation since I had high expectations for my first time eating here but the food speaks for itself and the majority of what we ordered were unique and flavorful.
Everything is cooked pretty well here and as far as service it's great..besides the overpriced menu there's nothing special you are simply paying for the name of Bobby flay
Great food and service, but the bar is heavy on Tequila
So I asked the hostess if they had vegan options and she said no problem -- our waiter will show us vegan options. When we sat down and told the waiter he said, "Oh we're not going to have anything for you here, so I wouldn't eat here." I said, "Well the hostess said that you have vegan options." He replied, "She doesn't know what she's talking about." He then asked the kitchen, returned and said that they could do this one dish vegan, so we said sure. . . He also said that their dishes were not that spicy. The food came and our vegan dishes were SO spicy that we couldn't eat them; I love spicy food, but they were inedible.. . Additionally, this waiter was SO condescending that a bunch of us were turned off. For example, the other vegan in the group eat a salad that had croutons on it. When it came time for dessert, he said, "None of our desserts are vegan, but since you ate those croutons which I said had cheese in them, you can have the desserts.". . It was not an enjoyable experience at all; I will never eat here again.
Amazing start to finish. Possibly the best ribeye I've ever had. The queso fundito app is fantastic. Wife had the veal chop which was awesome. And the margaritas were some of the best I've ever had. Will definitely return.
I just spoke with the manager (JP) and he was VERY nice about the whole situation, so I will give Mesa Grill another shot next time I'm in Vegas.
We had an outstanding meal here. The food was fresh and delicious and beautifully presented.
The food was delicious!  We came for brunch this past weekend and I ordered the Mesa burger.  Definitely helped with the hangover.  Our waiter was as nice as could be, but it was very obvious that he was overworked.  He was covering an entire section of about 10 tables (all with 4+ guests) and he had a hard time providing enough attention to each one.  This was not his fault, but management's.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido the second we sat down--it arrived nearly an hour later with our entrees.  Our drinks took about 30 minutes to be served.  All in all, brunch with 5 people took nearly 2.5 hours.  Be prepared to wait...and wait.
Pros: . Delicious food, great service, inside Ceasar's Palace and amazing decor.. . Cons: . The PRICE!. . Food Experience:. This was by far one of my most favorite food experiences. It was all just so delicious from the salad to the main entree to the wine. I ate chefs signature dish which was the pork tenderloin because it just happened to be the cheapest dish of $36. However it was heaven in my mouth! Bravo Bobby Flay on an amazing restaurant. Overall I paid $50 all by myself .. . Conclusion:. I completely recommend this place if you have the money.
Iron Chef Bobby Fray's restaurant.. Recommend "Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno" with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese, red pepper sauce, balsamic vinegar.
Wow, what a disappointment.  Had great expectations because I'm a huge fan of Bobby Flay.  The drinks are good, but incredibly overpriced. $14 for a margarita.  I will say, the duck appetizer was fantastic and I highly recommend it and the side dishes were also good, although $10 for a pretty small dish.  My big disappointment was my main dish.  I ordered the veal chop, which was huge.  I was so ready for this, but once I cut into it, it was pure fat.  And at $48 I was sick about it.  After cutting away about half of it, I finally gave up.  Didn't get much to eat.  And our waiter never came back to ask how our meals were, or I would have sent it back.  By the time he re-appeared, they had already cleared our plates, so I didn't say anything.  Needless to say, when my $94 bill arrived, I was not happy.  Don't think I will be returning any time soon.
Don't expect a good user experience at this restaurant they have clearly got more attitude than they deserve. I made 2 trips to try the restaurant The only reason was at the restaurant was to try the burger Bobby Flay won the South Beach burger contest and i was told i couldn't have it. The second time I was told I couldn't get a seat for two hours when they had no reservations booked......they had SUCH attitudes! !! I will never attempt to eat here again they clearly outgrown themselves.
Recommend the tiger shrimp appetizer, the pork tenderloin medallions and the Brussels sprouts. All were delicious. The margaritas were very good, but $16! Even for Vegas, that's up there. All in all a recommended stop.
OMG-this was the best meal I've ever had! My grilled pork tenderloin was delicious; hubby loved his scallops. The sides of roasted brussel sprouts with walnuts and pomegranate nd a warm cornmeal and bean tamale served roasted in a corn husk were delectable. My Mesa Grill Margarita was sublime. Service was impeccable. Idefinitely give this restaurant my highest recommendation. Prices were very reasonable for this class of restaurant.  The cooks, separated from the diners only by a glass wall were very entertaining.
Really Bobby... really?? Another pretentious restaurant trying to serve up  "out of the box" foods. His flavor combinations just did not work, he totally missed the mark. I tried a little of everything and nothing made me want to orgasm in my mouth more like, WTF did you just put in there.... gross and just weird..... And I will eat anything! I got 2 drinks and 2 apps, cost me $100 big ones.... I would much rather lose that in craps in 5 minutes then eat there again.... . BUT! The food 'looked' really pretty....... good job on the presentation not so much on the execution.... What are these? Lobster tacos for Ants?!?!. . There are too many other awesome food choices that are just as expensive to spend money on and have an orgasm in your mouth, sorry Bobby your restaurant sucks the Big one! Honey Badger Chef..... Big famous chef, he don't give a shit.....
Chef Bobby Flay's place in Vegas not bad service was outstanding food was good not awesome but then again it is not Bobby Flay cooking it is a Chef he has hired keep your expectations at that level and you will be pleased.. . The rating was for the service was a 5 for me and the food a solid 3.5 the Capitol Grill in Jacksonville has a better feel, service, and food.. . I recommend it just so you can say I was at Bobby's place but not a regular place to go when I am sure there are MUCH better places like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant , Now this place is Awesome!
I have been several times to Bobby Flays restaurant in Vegas, MESA Grill. Every time it was a great experience for all of us. We tried everything on the menu and we always look forward to try new items on the menu. Brenda is our server most of the times and we love her she is one of the best servers. Please, ask for her when you go there. GREAT JOB Bobby Flay with putting the menu together.
Wonderful! Get the Ribeye you won't be disappointed!
