Paris is a decent hotel.. . Location: Paris is in the middle/upper north part of the strip which is great. It's known for its very obvious Eiffel Tower. Right across the street from Bellagio and Cosmopolitan, Paris is definitely centered well enough so that you are in "the middle of it all." It's within walking distance from most of the big hotels, which is great since traffic on the strip gets really bad after a certain point in the night.. . Rooms: They're not the best (compared to Aria), but they're not the worst (compared to Stratosphere). The rooms aren't tastefully done and beds are a bit uncomfortable, or hard. The bathroom is nice and pretty large; however, the shower has no certain - everything is see through. They do provide you with a bit of closet space; we had two closets, three drawers, and a night stand with three drawers as well. The TV has a lot of Spanish speaking channels, and surprisingly, Chinese channels, which played both movies and popular television shows (American Dad). The English speaking shows were limited to movies, not so popular television shows. Also, you get wifi but you can only apply it to ONE device. The rest you'll have to pay for - a bit dumb.. . Casino/Restaurants: The casino was alright. It's a bit small compared to other hotels, but it is pretty clean. I didn't try any restaurants because when I took a look inside the buffets/restaurants/cafe and at their menus, nothing was quite impressive. Gordon Ramsey's restaurant looked nice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $70 for a restaurant decorated with electric red lights and one steak. The crepe place give out large portions, but you are paying $11. The buffet...well, Ive definitely seen better prepared food. . . Customer Service: I had a unique experience with customer service, specifically security/lost and found. So my friend lost her wallet and luckily for her, front desk told her that security had it. So we went down and they kindly escorted us to lost and found and gave us her wallet. They were very courteous, and were definitely careful with people's lost items, making sure they have identification and that they sign a check out form. Props. Our rooms were also cleaned by noon. . . Location: 5/5. Rooms: 3/5. Casino/Restaurant: 2/5. Customer Service: 4/5. . Overall: 2.5/5. Bump up to three on the rating bar because of the smooth experience with security in finding my friend's wallet.
This is based on impression of two restaurants -Mon Ami Gabi and Factory Sugar. Poor customer service starting from hostess, with attitudes like "take it (long wait) or leave it". Was originally planning to dine at the Eiffel Tower, but forget it, I deserve better treatment.. . I think Vegas has gotten too snob, not realizing that customers do have a choice not to consume, especially given their prices are ridiculously over-priced for quality.
Check-in was a bit of a mess. I had our paperwork confirming that we had 3 night stay there but they had us for only 1 night paid. Luckily the people who set up our stay were with us & after 30 minutes the mess was straightened out and we got early check in without paying the fee. . . The room was a nice corner penthouse room. I will say walking to the rooms down the hall-there is a lot of maintenance that needs to be done! Wallpaper peeling, crown molding falling apart, carpet in need of replacing-I'm sure when this hotel was new it looked far better than it does today. The hotel just looks beat-up. The bed was HARD! I don't think we slept much because of the bed. Even being our room was non-smoking you could still smell the smoke.. . The little Crepe place was fantastic. We also enjoyed Jersey Boys, it was a fantastic show.
We must have been in an old section of the hotel, because our room was very outdated. . . Cons:. -Main room: wooden details and knobs ripped off the large entertainment stand, hideous loveseat and couch (I really wish I would have taken pictures).. -Bathroom: crack in the door, stains on the ceiling, the heaviest blow-dryer I have used in ten years, bad wallpaper, shower curtain held on with plastic clips (hard to move and tacky).. -They are charging a resort fee for Internet Access and Fitness Center use for $22.80/night. I understand if it's summer and you're paying for the pool and towels, but it's winter and I think the resort fee should be waved. . . Pro: Great bed. . Luckily when in Vegas, your room doesn't matter very much! So on to the good stuff. The Paris Hotel has a lot of great restaurants in it and my favorite is Mon Ami Gabi - I go every time I'm in Vegas (you should sit outside to people watch and see the Bellagio water show). Also attached to the hotel is Sugar Factory: American Brassier, which is 24/7 and has a cheesecake factory menu (choices), fairly priced, and they have super fun drinks and desserts! Also, the location of the Paris Hotel is great, there are a lot of things to walk around and explore outside. Overall, I would recommend the Paris Hotel if you can get it for a cheaper rate.
This review is based on the gambling components of the Casino.  The dealers are un-focused and I had to help 3 Blackjack deals do simple math on the deals.  I don't think I would ever consider this place a gambling destination.
This review is for the casino/lobby only. I was not that impressed. . . I was here years ago when Paris LV opened and it was fresh and new. Being originally from Montreal, my French is more than passable, and then it was fun and cool to come into the Paris lobby and speak French to anyone working here. Now, they have no idea what I'm saying as none of the staff I tried to converse with spoke or understood the language. The decor is still adorable and tres Parisienne, with nods to the Art Nouveau metro signs, faux outdoor cabarets, and the adorable patisseries and boutiques along les faux rues Francais. I was disappointed in the drinks my mother and I had at a "cafe" in the lobby; they were overpriced and small (even for Vegas standards). The gal serving us was nice but clad in super-short Daisy Duke shorts that barely covered her nether regions and was about as French as Honey Boo Boo. I was a little surprised - not in a good way - to see pseudo-strippers in thongs and bra-like tops gyrating to music atop an elongated table in the center of the lobby (I know this is Vegas, but STILL!). I swear, I'm no prude, but the atmosphere just seemed....seedier here than in the other major hotel casinos we visited. . . I must make note of the bathrooms, too. The women's facilities were dingy, and some of the enameled ceramic pedestal sinks were cracked. Some of the bathroom stalls were dirty, and some doors had  graffiti carvings on them (at least, mine did). They didn't appear to be maintained well. . . The replicas of the Eiffel Tower and l'Arc du Triomphe were awesome landmarks, and we took a few photos by them. And the few folks we talked to who worked here were friendly. All in all, this is a cutesy place to check out, take some photos in, and then leave.
Cool Hotel to visit and gander about while staying in Vegas!  Made to look like one is outdoors when in the main lobby/casino with walkways and appearances of the outside of an apartment or condo complex.  The Eiffel Tower replica is indeed impressive.  The Paris LV Hotel also exits into a small shopping center (not the miracle mile shops).  . . I didn't do any gambling or order drinks so I cannot attest to the service on the casino floor.  The service at the Eiffel Tower "attraction" was good.  The hotel is also home to some higher end restaurants, including a featured GR steakhouse.. . Based on some reviews of the rooms, it's unlikely I'd stay here, but it is indeed a cool place to visit.
Good to take a look around if you're a first-timer to the Strip, bu tthe Eiffel Tower gets old fast.  Inside casino doesn't smell very good (like cigarette smoke more than anything else) and has very dim lighting = poor pictures. The decor is pretty cute though and Paris buffet is still one of the best I've had on the strip. Mon Ami Gabi is also a great restuarant. But overall the casino layout feels very compressed and claustrophobic (maybe because of the low ceiling that they painted as a 'sky'). It's not one of my favorite casinos in LV.
We ended up getting a pretty big room with nice king size bed, shower, fridge, couch, etc. Bed was very comfortable. We got one meal up to $50 at the restaurant inside the Paris. Perfect location for walking the North and the South strip. Had to eat at Gordon Ramsey's, that was amazing! We would go down to the bars until John the veteran became a dick after our third night down there. He said we had to bet all in every time or he couldn't serve us anymore. Other people around us were asking what that was all about and that they weren't betting all in, so they kept playing. We just think he wanted us gone to get bigger tippers. We're both veterans/active and thought everything was all good, until that. a well. For each their own.
I was expecting to be disappointed, but I actually enjoyed staying here quite a bit. The theme of the hotel was a lot of fun and the location was good. I had a lot of fun at the hotel and would definitely stay here again.. . Keep in mind that if you get  strip view room you'll have a great view of the Eiffel Tower, but you won't be able to see the Bellagio fountains very well because of it. . . You will walk A LOT if you go here as it doesn't have convenient access to the monorail (it's a long a$$ walk next door in Bally's) and everything seems like a 20 min walk. I definitely don't recommend it if you are going to a conference at the convention center. . . TIP: DO NOT get the meal plan when you make your reservation - the food sucks and is not convenient - HUGE crowds and college cafeteria taste is sure to disappoint everyone. There's no refunds 72 hours in advance either, so once you discover you don't want it you are SOL. . . I went in the winter so I didn't use the pool, but it was small and simple by Vegas standards. I also thought the casino was below average, but I'm not a gambler so I'm just basing this on appearance compared to those at Mandalay Bay, MGM, Luxor, Venetian, Bellagio, etc...
Can I give no star? No, too bad. My family and I were visiting all the hotel/casinos at the strip and this one is the worst ever. Rude people, I mean employees.Thank God I was not staying there.
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100. . I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.. . This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.. . My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. . . The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.. . Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. . . 3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!
Rene at the Total Rewards desk is a total jerk.  He's very unprofessional when he called me up and left my party of 5 at the line.  Apparently he can only serve 1 person per party at a time when we all needed the same thing.  The other Total Rewards rep didn't have any problem calling up other parties at the same time (with a professional attitude too).  Rene needs to be retrained and have his attitude adjusted or else Paris is just going to lose more customers than it already is.
Disgusting room. Rust-colored stain on the carpet (they tried to cover it with an ottoman, but failed), poo-colored smears on the wall, every hard surface needed re-painting, and pieces of the entertainment center were missing (but you could see the outline from where the molding had fallen off). The TV cut in and out, and the remote was taped together and didn't really work unless you stood up and held it against the receiver. . . I couldn't sleep, because I had the heebie-jeebies thinking that if this is what it looks like in the daylight, what the heck is going to crawl out at night time? Blergh. . . I realize most people go to Vegas for fun, but I was there for work and would have really valued a good night's rest and a decent hotel room. I was very disappointed, but told they had sold out for the conference and had no other rooms. Yeah, okay, sure.. . Stay FAR away.
Watching Bellagio fountains from my window.  I can't believe the hotel would hold a rave while a conference was happening.  The music was shaking my windows.  They should have faced the sound towards the Strip, not the hotel.  Service and food were good.  Enjoyed being a Diamonds Reward Member and getting things free like in the Diamond Lounge and a free trip to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
I hate you Paris! I don't believe that this is a four-star hotel on Orbitz. I requested a king size bed in a luxury room and instead got two doubles in a room that technically had a "Strip view," but it was actually a view of the pool. Apparently, they ran out of king beds and were unable to accommodate me, even though they had plenty of unoccupied suites available. So much for customer service. Not only that, but the room and the entire sixth floor smelled like cigar smoke on the second night. Wi-fi was free for only one device per room per 24 hours. I felt extremely itchy after sleeping in their sub-quality linens for two nights. The only saving grace was its central location on the Strip.
Was forced to stay here for work. If you like pubic hairs in your bed, weird/unexplainable stains on your sheets, false eyelashes on the furniture, and "fine print" mandatory charges for resort services you didn't ask for/want/need.... Paris is the hotel for you. I believe Napoleon is turning over in his grave.
Just checked in, mini-bar completely empty. Called front desk, they said they no longer stock the mini-bar. Was told it was available for my use. . . No Coke in the hotel, told to go next door!. . No Diet Pepsi in the machine on my floor, or the floor above us. . . No list of TV channels I'm room!
Ah Paris!!! First this place has one of the best locations on the strip! Dead center in the middle of all the action.  When we first arrived I appreciated that they have Valet service included in your stay.  Another great amenity was they are pet friendly.  When ever I can travel with my two super spoiled and adorable yorkies I love to take them with! We stayed in a pet friendly room located on a certain level.  The best part about the room was the view!!!! We were high enough to see it all from Paris down to the luxor's beaming light at the top.  . . The check in process was fast and the customer service was great!  I loved how my yorkies had a place of their own outside and it was too cute seeing them walk through the casino with their sweaters on!  . . Anyhow, I had to take one star away as the furniture does need a much needed update.  There were many cracks, scratches, and pain over jobs.  I wanted to make sure also that we didn't get charged for any extra bite marks left from other pets so any I discovered I let them know as soon as we explored the room.  There was also some pet hair left on the cushions of all the chairs and couch.  I understand it is a pet room but housekeeping should make sure these items are checked as my pets don't shed. We were also suppose to receive some pet goodies as that is part of their luxury pet deal but they never gave us the items so we had to call to receive them.  . . The next star I took off was there was a lady in the room next to us that her dog howled for two days straight.  To be honest I did not mind the howling at all.  We spent muchtime outside the room and I knew the pup was small and probably had never been left crated so no biggy.  The issue I had was we got blamed for the howling one night!!! my dogs do not howl or bark and although I know the rooms were directly connected and linked it was very clear where the howling came from.  We let the front desk know it was not us but the room next door. They did apologize and I also let them know we were okay with the howling since we were right next store. we continued with leaving the room to have dinner.  When we came back there were 3 staff members walking and one of them decided to sneak over to the corner to check on the noise and spoke in Spanish about how annoying the dog was and how they put in a complaint (they did not see us coming around the corner and they jumped with surprise)  Caught red handed! But akward as we passed her to get to our room. . . Anyhow, the military discount is great here and we did enjoy all the things the hotel had to offer an update on the rooms and some akwardness with the pet issue.  I am glad I have this hotel checked off the list it's not the worst but its not the best!
Its too bad to see all the low reviews for Paris. While I agree the place needs an update/upgrade/facelift (minus a star) the outstanding customer service is enough to keep me coming back. . . From the drive in you are immediately transformed to Paris and the minute you walk into registration you remember why you booked a room here. All the decor is very French even the restroom signs are in French. . . The hotel is smaller than the Venetians of the Strip but it offers better customer service an a more intimate experience. It's also nice to walk around without getting completely lost. . . The tables are $10 min during the day with plenty of open tables to go around.. . There is a great central bar that serves tasty cocktails. Go for happy hour to catch a good deal. . . Valet is free at the hotel. . . $20 resort fee includes access to their fitness center so take advantage if you can. . . The bed was super comfortable which was a nice surprise. . . Checkin and check out was a breeze. . . Every hotel employee we encountered was unbelievably nice and helpful.
The two stars are for the fact that my room, while outdated, was very clean. That's the only good thing i have to say about this place. . I got there at the exact time I was told I could check in. Still, I had to wait an additional hour because my room was not ready. The staff wasnt rude, however, they werent very welcoming either. . The biggest bummer was the fact that the sole purpose of my Vegas trip was to drink, party & have a good time. That was not going to happen here. The crowd is an older one. I felt oh-so-very uncomfortable walking from my room to the strip (in my club-ready dress). Almost as if I was afraid to run into my grandmother looking like a.... well, not like the young lady I dress like back at home. Lol! . Anyway, at the end of the day, I had a clean and comfy room. HOWEVER, I wouldnt be back unless the room was comped, again.  . . OH! Check out these pics of the hallway that led to my room....
I stayed three nights in Paris. I requested a room with King bed. They gave me room with two queen beds. Next day, there was availability and they moved me to a room with King bed. Queen size bed was very uncomfortable. King size was not bad. Rooms were very clean. Bathrooms were clean, wide, functional. Check in was fast, although there was a big line. What I really liked about bathrooms were they had closed cabin shower and a separate bath tub. TV was basic, some good channels. It was very quite, had no noise problem. Hotel location is awesome, at the center of everywhere. Elevators worked really fast. My view was back, looked towards airport. I also used their spa company, wrote separate review for it. Paris has good restaurants inside. I also recommend going top of Eiffel Tower, view was spectacular. Monorail metro is also very close, you do not need to leave hotel to get to metro, very convenient. My only problem was that they did not let me use spa the day I checked out, which was disappointing. Overall good place to stay.
Paris Hotel is famous for its iconic Eiffel towel.  Just across the famous Bellagio Water Fountain. Their parking garage is short walking distance similar to Montel Carlo, however be aware is been shared by Bally as well.  You had to walk by army of slow machines and tablets before you can get to the lobby or elevator.  For guess will be okay but if you are a self-parking hotel will not like that idea at all, the check-in lobby had many beautiful Chandeliers.  . . One thing irony, they had dancer near the gaming tablet.  I just do not see any French Connection with that.  However, does had entertainment value and definite can cause distraction to those who play that. . . I was not that fan of their interior style, a fan like it but it does not see too impressive or most romantic.  The crowd was mostly in older 40 and higher.  I do wanted to go up the Eiffel towel in the near future.
