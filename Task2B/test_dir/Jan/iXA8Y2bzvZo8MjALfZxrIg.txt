We stopped in here for a meal while in Vegas. The theme and decor are fun. A must visit for any Jimmy Buffett fan! My mom and I split the fish and chips meal. Very tasty! It was a good portion and filled us up. The service was just ok.
Great customer service! After I comment about a bad experience I had with my pregnant wife getting a alcoholic drink instead of virgin like we ordered. The next day I got emails from corporate apologizing for what happen. I was really impressed with our fast and understanding they were.. . share the nachos!!!
This is always on my list of places to eat at when in Vegas. Love their Coconut Shrimp! Nachos are great too! Margaritas are delicious! Can't go wrong with eating here! Music can be a tad too loud & it makes it hard to hear the waiter or the people you are dining with but its a fun place to eat at!
Margaritaville is a great place to stop by and drink on the strip. It's actually become our favorite place to pregame.. Basically due to our favorite Bar-tender, Tom. The guy makes a perfect 'Perfect Margarita' and makes me and my sibs feel so welcomed. . Thanks Tom! Heading to the strip now, see you in a few!
Fine dining? No. Good service and decent food? Absolutely. . . As a Buffet fan, I like the theme and ambiance at Margaritaville. It's just a fun place to have some drinks, listen to some tunes and grab some food if you're so inclined.. . Stopped by with some co-workers for a no-fuss, easy dinner at CES this week and Margaritaville hit the right marks.. . Our server was really friendly and fast, also quick to fix a miscommunication regarding a side Caesar side salad.. . Drinks were cold and plentiful and my Cheeseburger in Paradise hit the spot.
This review is based off only one visit which was for a company holiday party in which we had an entire section to ourselves.  The catering for the event was pretty good, and the employees were constantly coming around with trays of food and serving drinks.  The atmosphere I thoguht was perfect for a party.  We were up on the 2nd level, with seating on the balcony overlooking the strip.  They have several heat lamps to keep people warm during the colder winter hours.  I am not a drinker, but from what everyone else was saying, the drinks were good too.  I feel like this was the best company party location we have had in the 6 years I have been with my current employer, so hopefully we come back again.
Gotta love some Jimmy Buffet and I do, but there is a limit to everything.!  But when on a girls-weekend..its perfect. The nachos are good..believe what you hear. They can feed 4 easy, so order accordingly. I had a ham panini - it was actually one of the best meals I had all week. Kinda of a Cuban panini... tasty. One chick had the Wedge Louie Salad.. she wasnt that impressed. The iceberg didn't look that great. Another had chicken wings, they were a hit. Service was friendly and considering the crowd, speedy enough. The deco is fun and makes you want to go to Florida. The Margaritaville casino is 'cute' but wasn't very busy. The food is solid, well priced for the portions. A good deal on the strip.
I never would have opted to dine at Margaritaville (despite being a Buffet fan), but went with a group and didn't really have a choice in the matter. . . 1. The food I ordered was good. I had a fish sandwich and fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed it. . . 2. The show that they put on is SO damn hokey that I stared in open-mouthed horror/amazement. It's a good place to take kids; however, it's not my cup of tea. Mostly I felt terrible for the performers who had to put on the show every hour.  The show involves performers on stilts, costumes, singing along, clapping, and a water slide.  And topped off with balloon sculpting (if that's what it's called) hats for select patrons. . . 3. We had a friendly server who was patient with dealing with a large group (9 people) for dinner. She did well except for some issues splitting up the bill. . . 4. The food and drink prices are pretty high and I'll assume part of that is due to the fact that it's Vegas and most of the food/drink there is costly (in my humble opinion). I thought it was overpriced, but it's Vegas so I'm not surprised or complaining. . . 5.  One member of our party had a rare (medium rare, maybe?) cheeseburger and was the unlucky recipient of food poisoning a few hours after we left. There was no doubt that was what it was from. It was not from another restaurant, nor was it the flu. Based on that alone, I have to go with one star.
After ordering a drink that tasted a little funny I returned to the bar and noticed a foul odor and several fruit flies. I looked around and noticed a health code violation.  Drinks were stacked on top of each other and gathering condensation. Trying to be discreet, I told the bartender. He looked at me like I was stupid. I then requested to speak to the manager- this is the kind of thing that will shut a place down! I explained the concern to the manager and he immediately began removing the stacks and agreed with the observation. He then proceeded to wash the glasses over again and place then properly without stacking. Glad they took note of an observation but whydo the bar staff not know proper procedure? Yuck! Sorry I had a drink here!
I was not impressed with the menu. been to a few others around the country, but this one seemed to have a lesser menu. Staff is nice, clean place. nice atmosphere. Way too loud. They play music at "club" levels & you can't hear anyone speaking around you.
Every time I am in vegas I stop off to get dinner here at least once. My wife and I went on 1/21/14 and we were not impressed. For the first time ever we left thinking we would have been better off eating somewhere else. We got two orders of wings, one was waaaayyyyy to spicy and the other waaaayyy to sweet. Ive ordered them at least a dozen times but that night neither flavor was very good. The band playing was so-so and we have for sure seen much better there. We found ourselves praying for the music to stop so we could have a conversation. This was the only time we didn't enjoy our time there and Im sure the food was the main issue. I mean heck the better the food the more fun you have and the more you get into the band that's playing. But not that night.
