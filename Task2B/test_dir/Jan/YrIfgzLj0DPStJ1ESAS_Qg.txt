Nice atmosphere. Didn't take long for us to be seated and have our order taken. Our waitress explained the menu to us and the food was great!
I've gone here every New Year's Day in the last four years. But this time, there no longer serving fresh crawfish.  Frozen only. Not cool.
Fiance and I saw this place on the Man Vs. Food ...and we had to try it on our next trip to vegas. We went the day after New Years Day the place was empty. I was kind of scared we were not at the right location into the menu mentioned that they had been on Man vs. Food..Everything you order is by lb and the price is based on the market price. We ordered kind lobster legs $ 26.99/lb, crawfish $ 6.99/lb, and shrimp $12.99/lb along with some cajun fries. We went w/ the waitress recommendation and ordered all our food with the Hot N' Juicy sauce, spicy. Food was delicious except the crawfish they had warned us it was not fresh, which may explained why it tasted a bit salty. Still good but salty... Overall experience was great. Will come on our next trip to Vegas (may skip the crawfish). Beware...eating here you will get messy, they give you plastic table cover, bids and gloves to eat (eventually you dish the gloves & start getting dirty). You will smell after leaving this place...
I really wanted to like this place.... . So my friend Yannie has been raving about this place called Hot N Juicy.. . "Sooooo good," she says. "Better than boiling crab," she says. "You have to try it," she says. . We were together in Vegas for New Years and decided it was time for me to try it after hearing so many good things about this place.. . We ordered and the employees told us that the crawfish is frozen aka not fresh, so it's discounted, okay that's fair. So when we ordered 10lbs of shrimp for our group. Let me make a couple comparisons we can all relate to.. . Plastic bottle liquor vs top shelf. Soccer in America vs Football. My shrimp vs fresh shrimp. . My shrimp must have been the bottom of the barrel leftovers or something, but it was almost to the point of disgusting. Trying to peel the shrimp was difficult as the shrimp itself would just disintegrate and fall apart. It was like the employees packed a bunch of powder into shrimp shells and cooked it. . . Highly highly disappointed in this place. The ONLY reason why I gave this an extra star is because the sauce was halfway decent.
One of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas!  I'm a Southern girl and grew up eating mudbugs (crawfish) piled high on backyard picnic tables.  It's next to impossible to find really good Cajun crawdaddies outside of the deep south so I usually avoid trying because I'm almost always disappointed.  I have found the mudbug holy trail though!!. . My guy is a Yankee and my mom and I are on a mission to southernize him as best we can hehe.  So one night crawdaddies were brought up and I realized I had a major hankering for the little red guys I had heard good things about this place so I decided to give it a go so I could quench my craving and take my guy's crawdad virginity, two birds, one stone and all that hullabaloo. . . We got there and there was about a twenty minute wait.  We had to wait outside cause the place is pretty packed with tables.  We were seated and our server was very nice and took the time to explain how things worked.  You order your protein (crawdaddies, shrimp, soft-shelled crabs etc) by the pound and choose your seasoning (Cajun, garlic butter etc) and they bring them out in bags.  No plates in this place...the tables are draped in plastic, there are plastic bibs available...you may look sill but they are definitely needed, those suckers might be small but they are seriously messy!  This is not the place to go if you plan to do anything afterwards.  . . We ordered a couple pounds if crawfish with Cajun seasoning and an order of corn fritters.  I love spicy food, he doesn't.  It was a hit with us both, not too spicy and not too mild.  The fritters were divine and a good sized serving for the two of us. . . The big bonus was the price.  The market price of the crawdaddies that day was $7/lb, the next day I was at the grocery store and there were frozen crawfish for $6.75 for a little under a pound and you still had to cook them and do the cleaning up afterwards.  I'd gladly pay a quarter more to not have to do the work!. . I haven't stopped raving about this place and keep dropping hints as often as I can that I'm jonsin' to go back.  I see some more head suckin' in my future (the heads are where all the yummy bits are, if you don't suck the heads you are mission out!) See y'all soon lil mudbugs!
This place is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I've been about 20 times in the pass 5 months I've lived here. The Crawfish is so flavorful. Growing up in Louisiana this is def. A place I would bring my family. This place is better than boiling crab by all means. I think I may go tomorrow for lunch :)
I think I overhyped this place, not only for myself, but for everyone else who came with me. What can I say? I heard great things about this place, but when it came down to tasting the food myself, the excitement suddenly stopped. I mean, the sauce was decent. However, my brothers complained that the sauce was too plain, and that their shrimp and crawfish were not drenched enough in sauce. Also, the sauce was surprisingly not as spicy as the server described it to be. I must say, I certainly did NOT like the sausages that I ordered. Worst sausages in my life. I seriously could not force it down for the life of me. It was also a no-go with the chicken nuggets for me. I recall cafeteria nuggets tasting better... . . Service was a bit slow and unorganized. The place was pretty darn small too. Once the dinner rush started, many parties ended up huddled around the bathroom. Not very comfortable if you ask me. . . I think I might try the newer Hot n Juicy the next time I'm in town. My brothers raved about the newer location being better than the kickin krab (my absolute fav) back at home. Unfortunately, I went with the overall statistics of THIS place and paid the price: cranky brothers and an unsatisfied stomach.
I've been to Boiling crab on Friday and was told Hot n Juicy was better.  So here's my review.. . Food: Boiling crab's sauce to me seems to have more flavor.  The shrimp here didn't taste as fresh.  Maybe I came on a bad night?  The fried catfish was a disappointment as well.. . Price:  Boiling Crab is a tad less expensive.  Not too much to make or break the deal.. . Service:  Boiling Crab.  Our server was really friendly and attentive and funny.  Did I mention he was cute.  I may just come back for him. ;)  Hot n Juicy was friendly but our waitress seemed to be in a rush.  This was a Monday night. . . Atmosphere:  Boiling crab was a lot bigger so I felt less Claustrophobic.  . . Alcohol:  This one goes to Hot n juicy.  They have a bigger selection on drinks.  . . Boiling Crab 4 - Hot N Juicy  1. . 3 stars.  Not terrible... But probably won't be coming back.
All around great and exactly what I was hoping for. Delicious and messy, just how it should be!
I came here and it was my first time trying Cajun food. I loved it! I ate here multiple times and always order the same thing which is shrimp, fries and rice. I always eat with my rice on the table lol. Although this location is small I would come here again...but thank goodness for the newer location just down the street!
Atmosphere was great. Love the fact that you can get messy and not everyone will look at you weird. The waitresses we're ok. I had the fried shrimp basket and it was yummy. The cajun fries we're so yummy but they fried my mouth but I couldn't stop eating them. . My husband had the craw fish and then the shrimp. I wasnt a fan of the craw fish (too much work for to little food) but the shrimp was soo good. Also the corn fritters are to die for. It's definitely a place to try and not everyone is going to love.
Fasten your Bib and Let's get Messy!. . The best crawfish place outside of Louisiana that I have been to. Order your selection of seafood, I recommend a pound each of the crawfish and shrimp, pick your sauce, and enjoy?. . Oh yeah, about plates? Who needs 'em! Your meal comes shaken up in the bag and thrown on the plastic tarp on your table. It's fun, messy eating from there on out!. . I recommend getting the Louisiana Style, spicy. If you want a blend of all the sauces, go for the Hot n' Juicy.
Love this place, always amazing! I get the hot and juicy special shrimp spicy it's so good. The Cajun fries are good too. Can't go wrong here unless you you don't like sea food.
mhhh, so i didn't even know i got emails on yelp...........but I got an email from the manager at Hot N Juicy. That was very thoughtful of them to want to remedy the situation. She wanted to know the date of my visit and who my server was. I really don't remember at this point and to be honest I wouldn't want anyone to be fired because of it. It was very uncomfortable and worth mentioning to the staff just so they are vigilant of their customers water needs and heat tolerance but, again, it was so long ago. Hopefully no one gets seriously hurt and they use my review to train servers. . . As I said in my response to the manager, I'm definitely not upset about what happened during my last visit and I would definitely go back over and over again. I would just be sure to keep the water coming because even if you love heat (as I do), it can get a little bit out of control if you dont have steady stream of refreshments to cool down.
So, I'm the girl who saw this on Food Network Man vs Food and thought, that looks kinda strange! I'm the girl who when my sister and my boyfriend wanted to try it out thought, well, maybe I'll get some salmon or something. NO! Right when you walk in you are hit with this aroma, I can't even describe it, its garlicy, its cajun, it's deliciousnes! I tried a couple of the crawfish, and they were coo, I couldn't really get past the ripping of the heads and what not. BUT, I had their king crab legs, in the cajun seasoning and a side potato and corn and it was probably the best crab legs I have ever had! I craved it the rest of the trip and I have been back every time that I go to Vegas. My last trip was Hot N Juicy trip number 3! The only con? Not enough crab legs per bag!
