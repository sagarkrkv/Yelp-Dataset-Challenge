The food is not good. It looks good but then you taste it and some of it is not edible. Went for New Years day and the fact that there was no line should have been a clue not to go in.. Some of the stations weren't being taken care of. They charged us $45 which is the same as the Paris or Bellagio buffets which are much better
My wife and I were looking for a buffet on the Strip and saw this discount ticket for the buffet so we decided to try it out without doing any research. . . We waited in along for a reasonable time (for Vegas), about an hour  in the early evening. However, after paying we waited a long time to be seated. There were only three employees seating customers and they were also also doing things at the register, helping with drink orders, and things like that. There were many open tables that were ready to go. . . Finally seated, we went to the food and it was QUITE lackluster. It's divided by cuisine (Middle Eastern, American, seafood, etc) and many of the items just looked like it had been sitting for a while.  It was just very disappointing. . . Funally desserts. We love desserts and a big portion of the desserts are cupcakes. Not everyone is a fan, and also no one wants to eat a full size cupcake. Buffets are about sampling lots of items. Crepe station seemed okay. Soft serve only, no real ice cream. . . I think i would've been happier just eating at McD's. I hate McD's.
This buffet is going downhill - I mean WAY down.  When I came a few years back, they won one of those buffet awards on the strip.  I agreed with the win cuz the food was decent and the desserts were exceptional.  Now, 2014 - This buffet will NEVER win that award again.  This dinner buffet is cheaper than other buffets on the strip and you get Below Average food.  Even the desserts aren't as good, majority were cupcakes - I don't care for cupcakes.  I want some good stuff like tiramisu, gelato, cookies, etc.  I love cookies and they had Zero/None.  Line was super long, it was line after line - first line to pay then line to get seated.  There was only 1 person walking groups/people to their seats.  Even some waiters had to come by to seat people cuz everyone was getting frustrated about the wait.  We got there at 5:20, didn't get seated 'til 6:30.  I wouldn't come back here again; don't waste your $ here.
I'm not one to pay attention to buffet reviews because in my opinion on all you can eat joints, "to each their own", but I wish I had listened this time.. . We came here during Christmas week for vacation and had our eyes set on Buffet of Buffets. We waited in line for an hour and it was finally our turn at the register. Turns out B.O.B. prices were increased by $20 for the holidays, but whatever right?. I had a Total Rewards card to get the member discount and figured it'd work for the total bill (just as it had for all the other places I'd been to) but the lady at the register insisted that all adults needed it. So fine, we go upstairs and get them and come back. AND THEN, we give her our gift card that a family friend gifted us, and she claims it doesn't work. Wtf bro (no one else had problems with it throughout our entire trip). So we decide to just settle and pay for just this meal. $200ish for 6 people. We get in line to be seated.. . Once we are seated, we went to get food. I walk around twice, ending up with a slice of Prime rib and some mashed potatoes. There's nothing good here. The crab legs were dry and grimy looking, all other seafood included popcorn/bbq shrimp and baked sole. The only other things that looked edible were the grilled skewers in the Middle Eastern section. The dessert is whack. Cupcakes and cotton candy? . . I get it, even if buffets suck in Vegas, there will still be loads of people, but c'mon guys, be reasonable!
We came here around lunch time with Buffet of Buffets (BoB) pass and we decided to come to see how bad it was. Seriously we didn't come with much expectation, we just wanted to see how bad it was after reading so many reviews. And we can't agree more, this buffet is really bad. They do have food but none of them look appealing even when you are hungry. The dessert station was full of cupcakes which I don't eat even on a regular day. I know you are gonna laugh when I am about to tell you that their steamed jasmine rice is the best they had there. Yes, I mean it. . We are so glad we went there with BoB, we only sat there for one hour. What an interesting ride. I don't know who would want to pay full price to get in this buffet.
How did this place get voted the Best Buffet in Vegas so many times?. . Yeah sure, it's fine and I suppose good enough for its price.. . All it's offerings though were probably below any other Vegas buffet I have been to in its quality. The selection is large but if I was a fan of super dry and tasteless fried chicken or a random taco bar that looked like it was hosted by Safeway, I would be more grateful.. . I don't really think it's worth the money since there are so many other offerings in the area but should you want to see what the hype is about, who am I to stop you?
I may have given another star had it not been for the place being so crammed together. I think they could use to lose a few tables and open up the dining area, also PLEASE pull your tables away from the area where people are walking to get to the buffet. I've never been seated so closely to the actual food. My table was basically IN the dessert section.. . As for the food - there's a lot of selection and numerous "stations" with different ethnic foods to choose from.. . I sampled mainly from the seafood; got crab legs, peel n eat shrimp, some buffalo popcorn shrimp (yum!), some sushi (dry, yuck). Tried some food from the Mediterranean section. Hummus, dates, lamb, naan bread, olives, etc. Okay, but not great, I've had better Greek food elsewhere.. . Mexican, American, and meat carving areas did not interest me, although my Father-In-Law got a nice looking piece of prime rib. My husband also got some fried chicken that he said was quite tasty.. . Desserts - Mainly their dessert section is cupcakes, although I did manage to find some pretty decent cannolis. The cupcake I had was OK, but kind of dry. I honestly don't even remember which kind it was now, but if you have a thing for cupcakes you will love this place.. . Overall - not bad. Of course, my Father-In-Law paid the bill so I can't complain. But would I throw down money here myself? Probably not. I'd go to another buffet around town. . .
The best meal you have ever eaten is really just a function of memory, and the spice market buffet was the best meal I can remember eating. Absolutely everything that I tried had the taste of an intentionally crafted dish, not the thrown together, hurried preparation you might expect of a buffet. I thoroughly enjoyed feasting at this location. Everything from an attentive server, to a good music selection as I ate, was perfect.. . I cannot recommend this buffet more. I would definitely go back. Yum!!
Came here for the lunch buffet. Most of the food was pretty average. There is good variety, but the only good section was the American food section. The meats were all cooked very well. Some of the desserts were pretty good too, like the baklava and creme brulee. There's also a huge selection of cupcakes, but I didn't try them.
One of the lesser buffets in Vegas but decent and nowhere near as horrid as Flamingo's train wreck of a paradise in a retirement home.. . At least they had crab legs which were decent, they had OK prime rib, and they had a decent selection of Mediterranean, Mexican and mid-eastern cuisine.. . An entire two stars off for their Italian section which was just confusing and tasted worse than Souplantation.. . Not as many selections as the larger buffets in Vegas, but at least they had a couple of good items.. . .1 points off for the nasty TVs. Fix the burn-in on the screen or get one that doesn't turn white people into a pasty yellow.
We weren't looking for something hoity toity.. and we didn't want to spend $50+ for a buffet meal on New Years Day. This was a solid option aside from the long wait that we experienced to get a table. We were disappointed to peek over the wall and find entire sections of 10-12 dirty tables with one busser slowly working each table, as we stood and waited for a place to sit. The drink servers/table clearers do hustle but they are likely overwhelmed with the amount of tables they have. Our server kept up on drinks once we were able to order them.. . Our group didn't do the drink package as we didn't feel it was needed or worth it. . . The food? It was just fine.. split crab legs, prime rib that was tasty and not chewy, good fried chicken and plenty of salad options/toppings. They tried to do a little of this, and a little of that.. but it's possible that their quality diminishes because of it - ie. Sushi. Sushi shouldn't be on the buffet unless it's an entire station of just sushi and it's made fresh in front of you by a sushi chef. One platter of sushi on the seafood spread is a little scary to me. . . Desserts were all delish.. we had cupcakes and cotton candy and ice cream, as well as flan, mousse cups and more.. . While in line, I chatted with the ladies in front of me who indicated that they'd been at the buffet a couple of years ago and it was good. I had hope! It's not horrible.. but it's not like some of the top rated buffets on the strip. Of course, it wasn't $65 for a meal either.. :)
Variety,but not quality!
We went there last night hoping to get a great experience well that wasn't the case. We went at 9 pm and the food looked old, most of everything looked like it's being sitting there for a while. I was exited that they had Mediterranean food, the skewers (only two pieces of chicken) were hard and the zucchini very mooshy. Alcohol wise the champagne was ok, wine selection horrible, my husband like the selection of beers. We also took a 4 year old that we had to pay $23 dollars for him in which I think it's insane!!!!!  How much can a 4 year old eat??? We weren't happy at all. Not worth your money
I've been here twice for their dinner buffet. First time they had their steak/chicken/lamb kabobs which was delicious along with their fresh/warm naan bread + hummus. Their chicken kabobs were slighly burnt but I went back for seconds for their steak and lamb. Was a little dissapointed that the second time I went they had only carved versions of lamb. Other notables was their buffalo shrimp/chicken, pretzel rolls and their peanut butter filled cupcakes. They also have little trays like Caesar's for their fried chicken & biscuit, chili, and meatball/breadstick. Decent price for their dinner buffet, try to snag the $5 coupon off the internet while it's still going on!
Will only visit this place if I'm comped.  What my party had to pay was more than $150 for 5 people.  The food was terrible and bland.  We had to wait over an hour to pay $150 for a meh experience.. . Go to the buffet at the Palms, 1/3 the price of this place and it is so much better!
Not sure why so many reviews are outraged and unnecessarily low-scoring: this place is about what you would expect for a Strip buffet that is not listed among the top best. This is not the Bellagio, this is not the Wynn, so scale back your expectations accordingly.. . That being said, it is surprisingly large and when I went on a weekend for dinner just after 5PM, the wait was less than 5 minutes. Maybe some consider that a bad sign, but as we dined business picked up.. . Came using a BOGO Groupon- all you can eat and all you can drink for two for $46. Not badat all. Pricing was not available online to see what locals prices were or which deal was better, but gave it a shot. The $11.50 extra for all you can drink option is not something I'd pay to add on in the future- BF and I each had two drinks (beer and champagne, respectively) and did not feel it was worth it.. . Food is divided up by cuisine style:. Seafood- snow crab legs and shrimp plentiful, but disappointed with sushi. Very little was out and it was all dry and falling apart as if it was left over from lunch or the day before. Was never restocked during our visit. Only consisted of simple cucumber, salmon and california rolls. Avocado in the CA roll was brown, ew. You'd think with crab and shrimp available, there would be a better selection.. . Salad- loved the wedge salads available, haven't seen that many places!. Soups- only chicken noodle and tortilla were available, didn't look appetizing.. . Italian- pastas all looked as if they'd been sitting out, but meatball was tasty. I'm mostly avoiding carbs, so I did not really spend much time in this area.. . Chinese- very generic, did not have anything here.. . Barbecue- BF enjoyed the prime rib, yukon gold mashed potatoes were delicious, barbecue pork shank was tasty! Despite signage for sliders, only fried chicken kept being put out. It was tasty but not my thing.. . Dessert- Tons of cupcakes. Not sure why they're so large, seems wasteful as most people are only taking a bite or two and trying other flavors. Someone probably needs to rethink this.. . Mid-Eastern- grilled veggies, chicken and lamb were all good, tabouli and naan flavorful, lamb tagine was surprisingly true to flavor.. . Mexican- Like the Italian area, disappointing. All food was very basic and appeared to have been sitting out.. . Salad- lots of cheeses, breads, and spreads available here. Opted for a lot of fresh fruit and got a wedge of brie with some fruity bread, very tasty.
The buffet has a beautiful selection.  It is visually impressive.  The food was just OK.  We ate about half of what we put on our plate and then went back to try other things.  There were a few nice meat selections, side dishes, and shrimp that the whole family liked.  The desserts were great.  The endless alcohol option had nasty watery wine.  If you choose that option go with bottled beer, then it is a good deal.  $33.99 for age 11 and up and $19.99 for age 10 and under seemed a bit steep especially with all of the trial and error we went through to find tasty food.  The service with clearing plates and replenishing beverages was just OK.  Don't tip when you check in, wait to see if your server is attentive and tip at the end.  The kids enjoyed experience.  I think my husband and I would have rather been at a steakhouse spending $33.99 on a steak and getting a nice bottle of wine.
