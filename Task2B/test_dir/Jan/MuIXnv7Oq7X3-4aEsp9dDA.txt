Excellent service and food and gluten free options were amazing. Chicken & waffle appetizer (gluten free) was awesome. Fish was large portion and delicious. We would definitely return and recommend to friends.
Tried the late night menu at the bar tonight, awesome food, awesome prices! Service was on point, thanks to Dustin! I greatly appreciate the industry discount for restaurant employees. We'll be back soon to try the full menu!
The chopped salad gets 5 stars, but the entrees get 3 stars, which puts me at an overall rating of 4. I had the scallops and grits...they were very flavorful, but a little too heavy on the oil.  Husband had meatloaf and said it was average.  We both loved the chopped salad though.  I wish it was a littlebit larger because I would be perfectly happy eating it as my entree.
My first time visiting this place and it was a great experience. We didn't have reservations, but the host was getting ready to seat 4 people to a table and that they would be freeing up 4 people from the bar, so BAM, we got seated at the bar in about 2 minutes. Branden was the bartender/waiter and was an absolute crack up. The food was fresh, drinks were great, and there is no reason not to go back.
Excellent food and service.  The meatloaf was phenomenal, as was the PB&B jar for dessert.
Food, atmosphere, and service was very good. I would go back next time in Phoenix.. Chopped Salad was awesome!
Chopped salad, believe the hype :)  its very good.  I'm not vegetarian or a big salad eater but this salad is a great way to start your dinner, esp if shared.  Get the smoked salmon version okay.  What makes its special is the great mixture and variation in texture of the different ingredients.  And I am not a very selective palate eater and cannot usually detect any subtle differences, but this mixture of ingredients screams very soft, to soft to medium to medium hard to hard to crunchy.  Its very well balanced.. . I had meatloaf and it was very good, the sauce they use to coat the meatloaf gravy is very good.  My friend had the scallops and it was cooked very well.  Just right, not over cooked and rubbery or undercooked and raw.  U may think its not a big deal but trust me, not a lot of restaurants can do it properly.. . service here is top notch and everyone is very nice and polite.  the place is a little noisy and can get crowded which might make it a tad noisy to have conversation.  but its pretty good overall and I had a wonderful experience here.
Cool place, very good food. Prices are a bit high for what you get. Service is so-so.
So disappointed - this has been our "go to" restaurant to celebrate special occassions - Last night was our first not so great experience here.  We waited an unusually long time for our dinner.  The waitress finally came over and said "I just checked on your dinner because I felt like it was taking long and they are getting it ready to bring out"....an additional 20 minutes later, our dinner arrived. . . I was so looking forward to the duck that I have ordered at least three other times.  I guess I didn't read the menu closely because they changed the dish....and not for the better - instead of warm, creamy millet or grits under the duck - the duck sat on top of luke warm diced "sweet potato" hash that tasted like it had been prepared hours ago and not a cherry in sight.  Now an amazing dish is just average and I won't order it again.  One of our guest had the short rib and it looked as if it had sat under a light for a while - dry....he said it was ok.  I felt bad since I encouraged him to order that dish based on past experience.  The meatloaf was the only consistently good dish this time. . . Then, since it was a special occasion, we ordered the chocolate brownie dessert....I love chocolate and brownies but this was over the top sweet - I had one bite - our two guest the same and my hubby finished it because he didn't want to leave it.. . We will probably give CPH another shot to redeem this experience but it won't be for a while and I certainly won't order the duck if it is still prepared with the hash.
I came here as part of a large party (approximately 50 people).  The restaurant was convenient to the hotel.  It was nicely decorated but he space was VERY loud.  I can't stand this in restaurants.  Especially if one is conducting business.  . . The servers were very accommodating.  I enjoyed their hospitality.  They brought out a perfect Guinness.  They were always ready with refills and suggestions.  We were provided with some very good bruschetta and even better chicken pesto kabobs while we waited for the entres.. . But here is the rub.  We had a limited menu with 5 selections.  It took almost 90 minutes to get our food.  They had several other parties.  I do not know why they did not have additional staff.  But this is pretty inexcusable.  . . I will say that the scallops were exquisite!  They melted in your mouth.  The corn grits were also delicious although there could have been more grits on the plate.  Come on folks grits are $2 for a tractor trailer load.  How about an adult 3/4 cup portion?  . . Finally, they had some unidentified green on the scallops.  It did nothing for the meal except remind me of baling hay in high school.  This did remind me that I went to school to pay prices like these!?!
This is a fun place for drinks and food. The bar is in the middle of the large dining room. The restaurant is well-located in a hip lively area of Scottsdale, near the art walk and canal area. The food is pretty good for a gastropub, but what I really love about this place is the interesting mixed drinks..and oh by the way, food is decent too. Other reviewers have hit on the high food notes such as chopped salad, lamb burger, and scallops. I could settle for the apps, Midwestern Manhattan, and the atmosphere.
Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.. . They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.. . For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.. . Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. . . Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not liketo take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. . . The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. . . The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. . . For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.. . Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. . . However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.. . Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!
This place is wonderful.  We arrived during happy hour (Sundays until 6 PM) so several of the drinks were half-price as were several of the Appetizers. We had the original chop salad which was fantastic (rate it a 10) and was tossed at the table. We also had the butternut squash gnocchi which I would rate an 8.  We also had the Barada which is an eggplant, mozzarella,  grape tomatoes, kale and breadcrumb dish which i would rate a 9. The only negative of the entire experience was the pork belly pastrami which we found to be very fatty and had to return. Our waiter Sam was absolutely excellent and added to our experience greatly. Overall great Experience.
My husband and I went here for date night last night and it did not disappoint. The service was excellent, and the food was amazing. We split the Kilt Lifter Fondue appetizer, which had amazing flavor. My husband had the Amaro Meatloaf, and before he tasted it he was questioning if $20 was to much to spend on meatloaf; but after he ate it he said that it was worth every penny, and he even loved the roasted zucchini side. I had the Porcini Filet Mignon, which was one of the best steaks I've ever had. We then split the PB&B pudding jar, which was also fantastic.. . We also had a few of their drinks, and I really appreciated the fact that their drink menu is full of unique drinks you don't find at every other restaurant. My husband particularly loved The Im-Port.. . The atmosphere was nice also. More dressy than your everyday dining but also not overly snooty. Like I said, all in all this was a great dining experience and I'm sure we will go back. :)
Sam really made the night exceptional. His knowledge and enthusiasm guided an unparalleled dining experience. Loved the short ribs and of corse the DeLeon Tequilla.
I went to Gibson's in Chicago and never thought I'd find a steakhouse like that in Scottsdale... until I was introduced to Citizens. . . One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of. . . The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.. . Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that'snot an issue for you... go here and enjoy!
Pork belly pastrami. Need I say more?  It is one of the best meats I've ever tasted. Then served as a deconstructed rueben. The cocktails are well thought out and served with a flourish. My  Manhatten with a flamed orange peel. We had several starters. All well executed and served either hot or cold. Just as intended. The desserts are the final touch. Pudding in a jar and chocolate chocolate brownie. The perfect anniversary dinner.
A self proclaimed gastro-Pub. This was a great find. Thank you Phoenix magazine! Service was great, atmosphere nice, drinks well poured and food was excellent. . . I had the duck with sweet potato hash. Duck was tender with a crisp outside moist and Cooked perfectly. Great meal I will be back.
Pork Belly Pastrami - excellent. Chopped Salad - unique. Smoked Duck Breast - delicious. Bread Pudding - fantastic. . Excellent all around.
Very surprised and pleased with the food, service and ambiance. Our server, Gary, was very personable and attentive to our needs.. . The chopped salad is as good as it gets. No need to say more except to make sure you ordered it. Excellent size for sharing with another.. . The grilled ono was very good. Good piece of grilled ono on a bed of pecorino romano risotto cake, spicy arrabbiata, sauteed spinach, balsamic glaze. Highly recommended.
Old town Scottsdale for sure. Old Town prices on food, small portions but tasty. Prices on beers were fair for Old Town but nothing local and nothing too exciting beer wise, as is typical with Old Town the featured beverages are overpriced mixed drinks with fancy names-best to avoid them.  Food as I said had small portions but had an eclectic menu with a lot of variety and was prepared well.
Excellent chopped salad and short ribs
Everything about this place was awesome! Love the cocktails; especially the sangria...the best we've ever had. Order the piggy and waffles and loved it. It was an interesting combination that was fun to try.  Loved the atmosphere..very fun upscale restaurant full of beautiful people.
Food is very creative and slightly avant guard.. Had the short rib with cherry bbq sauce and parsnip puree. It was absolutely delicious.. . Had two drinks, a Tom Collins and a margarita. Both were horrible. I mean just absolutely terrible and I should have sent them back. I've had better drinks from the bars on Mill Ave.. . It can get a little loud in there. And they don't have any cider; hardly befitting of a so called "Public House." But the food is excellent and they do seasonal menu changes.
Food was good but not great. Service was adequate but not what I would expect for that price and location. Probably wouldn't go back
