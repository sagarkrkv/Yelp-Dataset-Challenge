Best place for breakfast on the Strip... newer clean place, huge portions, great price for the quality, and very attentive staff.. . The line to get in can be pretty crazy, but if you have the time to wait, this is the place... you can't beat $8.95 for a simple breakfast platter that's big enough to feed Paul Bunyan!
This was our first time eating here, and we had one of the best experiences. We had the brown sugar banana pancake at our waiters ( 41158 Bryan )recommendation. Wow that was the best pancake we have ever eaten!!!!   The service was more then exceptional. Our drink were never empty, the food was unbelievably good, and the out waiter was very professional and friendly. The portions are enough to feed you for a few days.. . thanks Hash House...and a big thanks to Bryan.
HH is a fantastic place for breakfast! Been to two locations in Las Vegas and both are consistent. Plan on waiting because this place is popular and rightly so.....but it's well worth the wait. I had the dishes from the traditional breakfast to chicken and waffles. If you like pancakes, I highly recommend the Snickers pancakes....yuuuuummm!
The final food spot on this Vegas leg was Hash House. This place was packed, so we decided to bar at the bar. The bartender was full of energy and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the bacon stuffed waffle and the sage fried chicken Benedict. Let me tell you, it was a ton of food. The Benedict by itself was enough for two people, but when you add the waffle it turns into a "You will be Full as hell experience".  . . Good experience and I would definitely be returning!
The food here will feed your eyes better than your stomach. When the food gets to the table there's bound to be ooos and ahhs. But as soon as you eat a bite you'll be disappointed. Maybe even confused. How can something that looks so delicious taste so bland??? Yes the portions are big, but big portions come with big prices. The chicken and waffles can easily feed two people, so I definitely recommend sharing. Unfortunately that means only trying one item if you're not in a big party.. . The wait at 2pm was estimated at 45 min to an hour, but we got seated after 20 min. If you don't feel like waiting, be sure to check the bar for self seating!
Huge portions of food.  Oh my goodness I really like this place.  It was breakfast time servers were in the pajamas,  place was busy but not once were we unattended to.  My fiancee got the Andy sage fried chicken or shall I say man vs food choice.  I got the neapanee hash lunch special.  Both dishes were so good. Food comes hot as there is no hot lamps or microwave as soon as it's done, food is straight to you. Fresh squeezed oj. Bartender is heavy on the hands  This place is a must visit! !
In my short visit to Vegas, this place had a secure spot on my "to-do/must-eat" list. So for my first morning I headed over, sat at the bar and ordered the sage fried chicken ("featured on MvF!").. . Before I talk about the food itself, the staff there were fantastic, friendly and quick, and served with a smile and generous quick wit. That was certainly a pleasure! . . To go with my food, I had an apple juice and here they serve it unfiltered which is just the way I like it. When my (massive) meal arrived, it certainly looked very impressive with a tall sprig of thyme next to a steak knife impaling the food. The food itself, however, was on the bland side given the presentation (and my sky-high expectations I suppose). . . Don't get me wrong, it was all well-cooked and all but with the chicken and everything else drowned in the creamy sauce/gravy, there was not much going on.. . I'm still awarding four stars to Hash House, for good service and presentation. Food-wise it's one star down but only based on one visit and only trying one dish. Everyone else there looked happy!
Bit of a wait but worth it! The bloody mary's are super good- spicy and delish. I got the fried chicken n waffles- a big plate of yummy goodness.. The waffles even had pieces if bacon in them!
another one opens up....another crowded spot. this is my 3rd Hash House and definitely my least favorite one. we were enough not to have to sit through a long wait to get seated on new years morning when we arrived. the place was crowded but i guess we just got lucky. although, by the time we left the restaurant, the waiting area was completely packed.. . anyway, we sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant. our server was nice and friendly, she checked on us frequently even though it was obvious that she was running around servicing multiple large groups. i ordered the andy's sage fried chicken salad while others in my party had the popular dishes, chicken and waffles, pancakes, fried chicken eggs benedict.  my salad, just like all of their dishes, was ginormous! a house bowl of salad with caramlized pecans, apple slices, two pieces of the fried chicken and the big ol' biscuit. i asked for the mango dressing on the side. i have had the sage fried chicken at other locations and this time, my chicken was completely BLAND. what happened???? i was soooo disappointed :( . . i still think they have really good food here with over the top portions at good prices but honestly this experience has killed it for me. i was afraid this was going to happen, they grow too fast, open too many locations and suddenly the quality of food goes down. i really hope they make the proper adjustments soon.
I went to Hash House A Go Go for the first time in San Diego and had a fantastic plate of food with fantastic company. So when I was looking for brunch places in Vegas, and saw that it was conveniently located down the strip, I told my friends and family we were going there for brunch.. . We arrived for a late brunch on a Saturday. At about 2:00 probably. And it looked like there was a long wait, but in fact the queue went by quite quickly. In fact, our friends weren't there yet, so we had to tell them that we weren't ready to be seated. However, since we waited quite awhile for them, we were first in the queue when they did come, so we got seated fairly quickly after they arrived.. . The service is a bit hectic, but our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered Bloody Marys all around, and I opted for the BLT Mary. It comes with toast and a packet of mayonaiise and you get to build your own mini BLT with the garnish. Fun and tasty! Not the best Bloody Mary around, but big and strong enough to get the job done.. . I had the sage chicken benedict and it was really incredible. The other half ordered the chorizo hash and it was also really tasty. Just a lot of food. A lot. Like none of us finished our meals. But that's okay. It's not incredibly expensive for the food you get, and they weren't really in a rush to get us out so we got to chill out and have a good time.. . Our friends who are Vegas veterans (they live close by so get out here quite a bit) were impressed with my choice as they really enjoyed their lunch. I'd definitely come back and go to other locations. Maybetry something else. But their benedicts are so good, it would be hard for me to choose something else.
What I really admire about this place is the emphasis they put on making everything from scratch and using high quality ingredients. It's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (Our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.). . As for the food though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Chicken Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, a smoked salmon scramble and a chicken hash dish. The portions here are very large. Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.. . The star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. . . Everything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it. . . The wait to be seated and the wait to get your food is a little unbearable, especially when you're hungover from your Vegas shenanigans the night prior. But I would come back just for that benedict!
Above average prices with below average food. We ordered the smores latte and the chicken and waffles. The portions are big and look appealing when they come out, however when you start eating it does not satisfy the taste buds. When I eat junk food and put unhealthy foods into my body I at least want it to taste good. Also our waitress was very absent most of the meal. We had to go up to the bar to ask for hot sauce and ketchup. I would not recommend eating here. There are much better options.
Worth the wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. A unique spin on classic breakfast. I had the sage fried chicken and waffles. Yum. Yum. Yum. The hubby had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was almost as good as mine. ;) Only downfall. No restrooms in restaurant. You have to go down to the casino. Kind of a drag.
I ordered an avocado burger thing and I was in a food coma the whole day. The price is definitely worth the quantity and quality you get. It's a feast for your eyes and stomach. Some of the most amazing food on the strip after you go out and its open 24 hrs. Our waiter was top notch with his customer service bringing us all water before even asking what we wanted. I definitely loved that I wish more places did that. I'll definitely be back :)
Trash house a hell no is what I call this place.  I went on the recommendation of a few friends and it was flat out terrible.  I ordered the infamous chicken and waffles and the chicken was atrocious.  All of the people at my table agreed that it was the driest chicken they have ever had.  We literally hadto slug down a glass of water with every bite (no exaggeration).  The waffle was okay with the bacon inside but the chicken was unforgivable.  My friend got the Cobb salad and holy crap was it terrible.  Truthfully I would advise people not to go here unless you are staying at the quad hotel (old imperial) or you enjoy bone dry chicken and terrible food.  I know this review sounds harsh but it was genuinely terrible.. . Also New York times should be ashamed of themselves for recommending the chicken and waffles.  It's actually embarrassing that they recommended this garbage on a printed publication for the world to read.
We loved the Hash House! My husband got the chicken and waffles and I got one of those big ol' pancakes. The chicken was fantastic with a pervasive, but not overpowering, taste of sage. I got one of the brown sugar banana pancakes and it was at least 6x bigger than the ones I make at home. It was SOOO GOOD. I wasn't able to finish it at the restaurant, so we took it back to our room and saved it for a snack later in the day. It was just as good then ;) Definitely recommend.
You want a big-ass burger? Look no further.. . Hash House A Go Go has one-pound burgers by default. Yes, you will literally weigh an extra pound after finishing a creation that takes up most of your plate.. . Will you have a food coma afterwards? Youbetcha. Is it worth it? Absolutely.
Tried the Corn Beef Hash during breakfast morning hour.  Was good...but even though the plate looks big...a little deceiving since most of it was the potatoes.  Overall, a very different Pig/Cow themed restaurant upstairs from the lobby of the The Quad hotel.  A bit pricey maybe for some folks.  With tip and coffee, price comes out to be about $20.  But you're on the strip so that price is probably normal.  I don't know why the wait time was so long since there were many empty tables on the back.  But once at the table, the service was pretty quick.
Word of mouth spreads fast for this place which is hidden inside one of the less stellar hotels of the strip (and I say this in the least snotty way possible). Came here based on a coworkers recommendation of LARGE PORTIONS, CHEAP PRICES (notice the emphasis, he basically yelled this at me). We get there and there is a whole crowd of people and a 1 hour wait time. We patiently wait next to a giant plastic cow until our names are called at which point once we are seated, our waiter informs us its another 45 minutes for food. Based on all this wait time, you expect something spectacular, right? Husband ordered the chicken and waffles and I just got their buttermilk pancake since I was planning to eat his food anyway. Well the LARGE PORTIONS definitely is true. Also, they bring out the food as its ready and not all together so I got my pancake like 15 minutes before he got his food which is kind of awkward but whatever. Chicken was okay, moist and flavorful. Waffles were a disaster, some weird smell. Also, for such large portions, really only 1 small cup of syrup?? I saw multiple tables request a plate of extra syrup cups. Total bill came to $24 for two entrees and an iced tea. I'm sure this review won't discourage those who have already bought into the hype (it's okay, I was one of those) but for those who have discerning tastes, skip this place unless it's convenient for you and there is less wait time. There is better quality food out there in the vast wonderland that is the Las Vegas Strip.
Quite worried about the large portions after reading the reviews, but the sun-dried tomato with goat cheese scrambled egg omelette came in a manageable quantity, and was definitely enough to kick-start a day in Vegas. . Fluffy scrambled egg was what you'd expect from any good quality American breakfast, and the hazelnut mocha overflowing with goodness was a nice complement. . Though the line to get in was long and it was a busy morning, once in the servers were prompt, polite and attentive. Definitely worth a visit if you stay on the strip.
only if you'd like to be fed a trough of food like a pig. disgusting portions. my pancake had an 18 inch diameter. would rather pay for better quality food with normal portions than this mess of a plate. the lighting in here is nauseating. 30 minute meal felt like an eternity in purgatory.
Amazing. Huge portions and very tasty. I got the corned beef hash. Had to take home half. Service was excellent. It was nice to be treated well. I didn't feel like a tourist they were trying to rush out the door. It felt more like a mom and pop restaurant. Highly recommend will come back next time I am in town.
Food and service was great! Definitely bring your appetite! Highly recommend the Sage fried chicken & waffles... they beat Roscoe's, hands down. As busy as it was, our server was very attentive. Expect to take a to-go box out the door. Will come back for sure!
Deliciousness wrapped in a layer of Vegas fun... little too crowded during lunch but plenty of food served, 4 stars
Amazing!! Wish I came here earlier in my trip. We had the french toast, and hh benedict with the tangerine mimosas.. . Food was CRAZY. Large portions and loved how it all tasted. Waiter told us to try the pancakes (which bakes bananas and other stuff inside instead of on top!). . Definitely try the mimosas, so gooood!
FAT KIDS CLUB. . Be prepared for the LOoOoooOong WAIT here.  Good part is you can put your name down on a list and go gamble.  For 2 people the wait was an hour and 15 minutes.  Another way to beat the system is to order your meal to-go it took 30 minutes.. . Trust me when I say you can share a dish.  For the girls trying to hit up the clubs later on at night I suggest you DON'T try to finish a dish and just share.  Unless you don't mind feeling like a torta exploding out of your mini dress LOL.. . The food here is ehhh.... . Chicken and Waffles:  chicken was dry and the skin wasn't as crispy as I like.  The waffles were huge but sort of soft and mushy.  Every bite required a big gulp of milk to wash it down - that dry.. . OG Benedict:  bacon, spinach, eggs over easy and biscuit with a tomato cream dressing which was delicious!  Comes with mashed potatoes which makes everything better (and unhealthier but who cares you're in Vegas!).. . If I come back I'll be coming back when it's off-time for breakfast/lunch/dinner the peak time is just too crazy.. . BTW this is one of the LOUDEST restaurant I've eaten at.
The Rec and Food.. Andy Sage's Fried chicken is a mist. doesn't matter which you get, they are all great. . . Chicken was perfect. Crispy on the outside and moist thru out. Bacon mashed was creamy the way I liked it and Cheese scrambled eggs!. . The Service.. Wait time to be seated 15mins. . Server was great if we were curious anout an item id it was ordered in his area he'd run by with a quick flash.. . Only issue i had was wait time for food but it is to be expected of a kitchen that doesn't use heat lamps or micros.
Stumbled across Hash-House-A-Go-Go's menu on the Internet and couldn't WAIT to try it when we got to Vegas. I was stuck trying to decide between the Sausage Gravy Pot Pie (which seemed like a perfect cure for my Vegas hangover) and the Chicken & Waffles. I ended up opting for the Chicken & Waffles because theserver said it was the second most popular item on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the first, Man VS. Food's top pick, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portions were ginormous, easily shareable, and the prices were reasonable (for Vegas). Plus, they're open 24hrs, so it's perfect for drunk munchies or a hungover brunch.
Anything that opens 24/7 in Vegas is already a plus for me. Who knows when you're gonna be starving after the club or after a long night of drinking?!. . Anyways, we came here around noon time and there was a 5 minutes wait. Not too bad. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu to us. We ordered the Andy sage fried chicken Benedict to share. That thing was HUGE! It was quite tasty but maybe a little too heavy for me. I would love to come back here and try other things they have on the menu.
A good place to grab brunch/lunch on the strip. The food is pretty good and it's reasonably priced. The portions are HUGE, so split with a friend. I was here alone, and had to leave a large portion of my roasted chicken hash behind. The stuffed burgers are as monstrous. There can be a bit of a wait, even when there are empty seats. I'm guessing the reason is that the kitchen can only handle so much at a time. In fact, I was seated at a huge booth within 10 min and my section was pretty much empty, but the waiter did warn me that there is a delay in the kitchen.. Wouldn't go out of the way to go to this place, but if you're in the area it's definitely decent
The wait time is super long but I was lucky to grab a seat at the bar and the bar service was amazing! I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. The portion was enough for three people, I'm looking forward to the leftovers. The cream sauce had just the right amount of kick. This dish was awesome and I can't wait to try other menu items.
Bomb dot com! I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the rude hostess who was giving us attitude in the beginning. But apart from that, the food and service was amazing. I am obsessed with their kiwi watermelon lemonade!! I also ordered their roasted chicken hash ...the first thing on the top of their menu. Delicious! I don't think anything here will be disappointing. The wait is hella long but I guess you can go gamble while you wait (:
Best American breakfast. The portions are enormous. If you like to eat this is the place.. I never usually go to the same restaurant when I travel  but I am returning today I am curios to try other plates
Good food. Poor service.  We were seated in the bar area due to a long wait.  Our bartender/waiter forgot to put our order in.  We had to ask for refills of coffee and soda, and we had to ask for cream, jelly and butter.  No compensation was madefor the forgotten order.
Oh. My. God. . . Can this place really be real? The food here is absolutely INCREDIBLE! So delicious with EXTRA LARGE portions...like, share with a friend. Seriously. We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and both dishes were to die for. Bacon strips placed inside of waffles?! How can you not be ok with that?? Bes thing ever. No complaints just super full bellies and an awkward waddle out the door. We had a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of 5 but we just headed to O'Shea's downstairs to pass the time. Went by pretty quick and definitely worth the wait. The place is open 24 hours which is also a cool touch as it makes for great drunk and/or hungover food. Or just good food in general. Oh and don't forget to try the BLT Bloody Mary!!
Went here with some friends for breakfast after a late night out. We arrived shortly before 10am and the place was packed. We had a party of three and it took about 30 minutes to be seated so be prepared to wait.. . For my meal, I got the meatloaf hash. It was a large portion (as many people mention here), but I have to say it was quite lackluster. The food was very average in taste and even the "hash" was disjointed. All of the items seemed to be placed in the skillet randomly and didn't really have a tie together.. . Overall, this place is pretty pricey, you have to wait a long time and the food is very average. Sorry to say, this place is not worth the hype.
Went into HH LV with my heart set on the French Toast with banana cream, pecans, whipped cream. It was dinner and not on the menu. Inquired with the server if I could get it anyway. She politely declined, with reason. I asked her to please inquire with the chef if he would make it for me and she came back to the table with a big yes! Thank you  Krystie, great server, great attitude. Thank you chef!
Horrible experience from the moment we got there to the last step out the restaurant. Had to wait one hour and when we returned after checking out some slots for about 50 minutes, we found out they called our name just a few minutes earlier. This resulted in about ANOTHER  35 minute wait. Ridiculous. Our waitress seemed nice at first and progressively got less and less helpful. Orders we taken wrong, eggs prepared the wrong way. We asked for a correction and the food had to literally be re- prepared from scratch. I asked the waitress if my meal would have the same amount of chicken as the other chicken dishes and she assured me they were the same. When my dish came out i was shocked at how little chicken was in the meal. I asked her about it and she said it was supposed to be that way. What was she talking about just a few moments earlier, then?! We even asked for the manager because the experience was just that bad. The manager came by asked what was wrong. Mumbled something about getting that issue taken care of. And never heard an apology from him or the waitress. In fact we hardly ever saw him or the waitress again. Not til the meal was over. Wow. We pretty much lost our appetite just from the service alone but the lack of taste and quality in the food didn't help either. Then to top it off, a huge gnat landed and was crawling around one of our biscuits. Yummy. Yeah it's safe to say I regretted going to this place. The food was bland, carb heavy and cold. I think even IHOP or Denny's wouldve tasted better at the same price. I'm sure this isn't going to deter or impact the demand since there are so many rave reviews but my experience does not reflect the majority, sadly. I will definitely be calling their customer satisfaction line if they have one. There are only a few times I've felt insulted and outright sad from poor food and service, and this is one that is high on my personal list. I won't be back here again.
I'd give this place 4 stars albeit for the atmosphere.  A place that does such a good job with breakfast should be in a in a spot where their customers can look out a window.  Yikes.  Good food though!
Delicious food! Big portions! We had breakfast here and it was awesome. Like others said, the portions for a lot of foods are shareable... Especially the pancake! The pancake is the size of medium pizza! It's not only huge, but yummy. As were the crispy potatoes. Highly recommend eating here!
The most delicious brunch on the strip! We waited 30 minutes and would have waited an hour, but we scoured 2 seats at the counter, which was a fun place to sit!. We had a server named Mary I think, so sassy and onpoint with her bodacious coffee creations and witty counter banter. We ordered and split the chicken and waffles huge dish...it was plenty for 2, with decadent coffee drinks to boot, No fresh OJ was the only critique, but I'll return many times for such delicious chicken and waffles!
They told us the wait would be 45min to am hour.  We went downstairs to use our phones.  There is absolutely no reception in there, their only major con. Would be nice if they had free wifi.  It is difficult to have people meet you for breakfast when they can't get a hold of you.  They also do not let you use their phone. We came up after 30min and our name had actually been called 5min prior.  We waited 2 more minutes and got sat at a nice booth. Our server Jason was amazing.  He was very happy which made my mood better. He suggested a wonderful mimosa. Fresh squeezed orange juice.  It was very fresh and a good sweet.  She ordered the tractor combo with a vanilla waffle. They gave her potatoes instead of bacon.  They brought out her bacon quickly and she got to keep the potatoes too.  She said it was the best waffle she ever had!   I ordered the French toast.  The banana and pecans come together with the French toast so well. The toast is very thick. Felt like I had close to a loaf of bread on my plate haha.  Love the portions here $12.95 for each of our plates.  This restaurant is always consistent.  My favorite breakfast in Las Vegas.
Be prepared for a long wait unless you stalk people at the bar, which we did and waited less than 5 minutes. The service was wonderful, and even though the bartender was swamped he was attentive and nice. They were very knowledgable about food prep since I have a gluten allergy. My husband had the chorizo hash- spicy (and I love spicy), delicious, and a great portion. I had the eggs Benedict with the roasted red pepper sauce- I added hot sauce, so flavorful, enough for 2 people. The person next to me had a pancake that looked great- no exaggeration it was about 1 foot in diameter. Fresh squeezed oj was yummy and coffee was good (with free refills).
Boyfriend had the sage chicken and I had an Indiana special ( crispy potatoes, eggs, biscuits and gravy ) and we both loved our meals. The portions on our meals were huge, so we didn't leave hungry. We should have known it was going to be big when the sage chicken was a Man Vs. Food Favorite :) Service was great and we'll be back here.
"1 word... large portions" was what our server said upon greeting us at 3am. Well he was right! We ordered the Chicken Benedict and it was a wonderful combo of mashed potato, biscuit, egg, chicken, spicy gravy, spinach, and perfectly fried chicken. I may have missed another ingredient because they were piled on each other like a mountain. I usually don't like this form of "plating" (if you can call it that). Yet, everything worked and was perfect. I enjoyed it so much, I came back for breakfast... brunch... lunch... linner? Don't judge me, we were just here at 3am... next meal... cut to 3 pm. Ordered the Trucker Breakfast and a Smore Mocha. Smore Mocha was yummy, just hard to drink bc of their "plating?" It was drenched in chocolate syrup (not the drink, but the cup). I had to rip the cup of the plate bc the syrup glued the two pieces together. It wasn't discouraging enough to take any stars off their rating though. The waffle with banana was AMAZING.  So, basically... just come eat here. Be prepared to stuffed and sticky ;-).
Stop with the great reviews. Lets put aside the extremely slow service (it was only 6PM and the restaurant was about 40% full) and the screw up with the salads and forgetting an entree., Everyone has a bad night. So lets just focus on the food. Its just too much mediocre fare. Chicken pot pie.. just mashed potatoes with a boring gravy with more potatoes. Meatloaf - not that much flavor and again with the mashed potatoes. The salad was limp and not that cold.. not fresh.  The waffles are waffles... the chicken is fried chicken. I just don't see the amazement. So - once for the experience. But if you want a tasty meal, just turn around and go to Johnny Rockets - a simply burger will make you happier - trust me.
This is the place to go if you're looking to get your money's worth on the strip. The best items are available all day and are large enough that you can split a single dish with someone or take your leftovers to get two meals out of it (I'm definitely okay with that in Vegas). The bloody mary's don't quite live up to the marketing, but that only brings this place to a 4.5/5, and I'm willing to round up in this case.. . Their fried chicken benedict is fantastic, and while it's not as light as you would expect it to be... it really doesn't matter when it's gigantic and you're already drunk from watching some of the morning games down at the sportsbook bar in Planet Hollywood. Each individual part of the benedict was delicious and the price for it made the entire meal a great value. I've been to several places in other Casino resorts that charge more for the same "quality" of fare and give you a lot less in terms of taste, size, and price. The service staff when I went this last time was friendly and took care of me promptly despite a busy bar. I will always make it a point to visit here when I'm down in Sin city.
Service was very good. I did experience a service failure and the way it was handled was exceptional. My food came out and the chicken was luke warm, granted I did request something different with the meal that could have made for a longer wait in the window. The server immediately took my food to be refired once he was informed. The manager came right afterward to get an understanding of the situation. Everything was resolved immediately. Not only that, the server did not once let it affect our experience. The server continued to offer an above and beyond memory that I will take with me when dining at other outlets. Thank you!
Walked here from the Elara and it was worth it.  Not crowded early in the morning, and service was friendly and attentive.  The food came out much quicker than expected.
