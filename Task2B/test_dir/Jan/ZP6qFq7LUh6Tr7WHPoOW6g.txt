I have never felt the urge to write a review before, but I've noticed that Eat has more positive reviews than it deserves, while most of the negative reviews are buried in the "not recommended" section although they paint pictures similar to my experience.. . The atmosphere is nice, but the service and food are mediocre at best. My party of 3 arrived and were met with a line where no one had been asked for names or the number of people in their party yet. The hostess milled around and offered no explanation. We waited 30 minutes even though there were several empty tables. Again, the hostess offered no explanation. A party of two who came in after three other parties of two-three people was seated prior to us because they asked to sit at the counter (which was never offered as an option to the parties who arrived before). Once the food came, the hostess approached and asked if we needed boxes for our food before we'd taken a collective five bites. We waited about thirty minutes for our check after asking two different people: this was weird because they obviously needed the table...
Went here on New Year's Day and so happy we did! The website said it stopped serving breakfast at 11 but since it was a holiday they had a special menu until 2. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the chicken fried steak. They were both amazing but the shrimp and grits took the cake! The shrimp were huge and meaty and the sauce with the over easy eggs were to die for. The chicken fried steak had an awesome spice to the breadingand was cooked perfectly! The only downfall to this place was no alcohol. Probably didn't need it on New Year's Day! The coffee was outstanding and the passion fruit ice tea was great! It was not sweet but really good. Would come back and try the truffle egg sandwich next time!
Wow, if you can make it out here, you have to, at least for breakfast.  We got the chilequiles and the pancakes, both dishes were excellent.  The pancakes had a great texture, served with maple syrup, and were massive...what else do you want?  oh some sausage, yeah it comes with that too.. . Now about that sausage that came with both dishes, some of the best sausage I've ever tasted, if you like it a little sweet.  The chilequiles you just have to try, so many contrasting flavors and textures that I just can't put into words.... . Too bad it's a car ride away from the strip, but maybe that just means you can eat here without a crazy wait.  And the portions are very generous, don't plan on eating lunch after breakfast here.
I really enjoy eating here, and have tried many selections on the menu, from the pancacks to the oesole, and most everything on the menu.  I have enjoyed every thing i ate, but the menu is getting a little boring.  I really wish there were some new menu items added or changed.  The food is excellent, and it would be wonderful to try some different options, as I'm sure they will be delicious as well.
A little off the beaten path but only by a block. Truffle egg sandwich was incredible! And the potatoes were so well flavored you didn't need to add ketchup or hot sauce. Just an all around great dining experience.
Had lunch here for the first time. One of the best Reuben sandwiches I've ever had, friendly staff, and simply a quaint and cozy little restaurant. Have to go back for breakfast to try their pancakes! I only gave it 4 stars since I haven't tried breakfast yet. Will post another review then.:)
The family and I decided to go here for brunch. It was my first time there and it's a cute little place with a fairly inviting atmosphere. . . I had the Huevos Motulenos and it was fantastic. There is an interesting mix of flavors within it but they all work very well. We also ordered the pancakes. I am not a pancake person, however those were very tasty and I would order them again. . . I will definitely be back!
Perfect meal! Fresh ingredients, extremely nice staff, cool atmosphere, fair prices. Well worth the trip off the Strip. Hidden gem!
Killer cool local place that is the best any day of the week. If your not feeling well the grilled cheese and tomato soup cures all illnesses. The organic cranberry juice is alps really good. Cool atmosphere very laid back great service. If you have a sweet tooth the biscuits are the best in town.
Amazing!  The highlight of our Vegas trip.  The truffled egg sandwich is incredible.  Good coffee too.
It is hard to eat like a local in a place as tourist-centric as Las Vegas. But when my wife and I learned about this place from Yelp, we realized that it would give us a great meal and a respite from the oppressively bright lights and loud noises of Tourist Las Vegas.. . Everything is fresh, the staff is friendly and the prices keep the regulars (I'm certain they have many) happy. I opted for a Veggie Burger, which was fantastic. But everything else I saw come out of the kitchen looked similarly delicious.. . If I lived in the area, I'd go all the time. But, alas, I'm just a tourist, except for those few minutes at eat.
We had Sunday brunch here and everything was fantastic. This is the place where the locals eat in Vegas. The vibe was hipster-ish, but homey and the service was super efficient. Entrees were FRESH and delicious! We followed up with a visit to The Container Park and The Mob Museum. There are some interesting things happening in Downtown Las Vegas. Good to get away from the madness of the Strip for a few hours. If nothing else, you should definitely eat at eat!
The first thing you must know before eating here is not to come here on an empty stomach. I showed up on Sunday morning and waited between 30-45 minutes to get a table for two. The hosts were friendly and kept us up-to-date about the status of our table. Unfortunately, when we finally got our table, our server wasn't as helpful. He had zero sense of urgency and didn't do a good job of remembering our order. A second and a half after we ordered, another employee came back to double check our drink order, which was all wrong. Our food, which was good, was unceremoniously slammed down on the table moments later. I ordered the huevos motulenos and they were great, but not good enough to make up for the bad service. We kept having to ask for things like ketchup, even though there were potatoes on both of our plates. My friend had to ask for a coffee refill twice. These seem like basics the average IHOP waitress can do. Why can't downtown's "hippest" breakfast place do the same?. . What ultimately convinced me not to go back was when the check was delivered. A little note from management was included telling patrons that Eat does NOT split checks because they're so "busy." I just don't think that's good customer service, and I think it's a lie. They probably don't want to pay two credit card fees per check when they can pay one. Eat, this is Las Vegas. Excellent customer service is expected. Furthermore, who do you think you are, Joel Robuchon? Your food is not that good and the restaurant is not a place I would take out-of-town guests or even go back to. They don't serve alcohol, so you won't be able to wash down the bitter taste of bad customer service with a mimosa. Don't waste your time people. Brunch elsewhere.
From the street I would have never guessed this Unique Eat would be so rock star. The place is casual with many regulars of all kinds. I loved how some were very dressed up while others were casually brunching. This was my first time and I felt like the other diners were repeat customers for sure.   The decor is Up-Cycle cool and comfortable. . We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, Pancakes, Spicy Egg Dish (sorry I forgot the name), and Chicken Fried Steak. . I can not stop thinking about the Chicken Fried Steak!  It is so perfectly crispy, flavorful, and FRESH!. Everything was fantastic. The coffee was so good we had to take a bag home with us. . The Chef and Owner made it a point to check in with us and ensure everything was wonderful. . I don't live in Vegas, but I can not wait to visit EAT again. . A +!
Checked this place out with my boyfriend after he had read about it online as well as getting good recommendations from friends.. . The menu was small but everything looked really good.  I ended up choosing the free range chicken sandwich with house made potato chips.  . . Everything tasted so good and fresh.  Really enjoyed the food there and would definitely go back.
Yay for an update with an added star! If you read my initial 3 star review, I said I will return in hopes that the breakfast is above average. Well it was, and again the owner/chef was very much involved. . I sat solo at the breakfast bar. I enjoy this because the kitchen is in clear view and you can see everything that's going on. Including communication and hustle of the staff. The girl who cooked my food even came over after to make sure I enjoyed, and suggested something for next time. I LOVE THE INVOLVEMENT!! From everyone!! . But anyway on to the food! . First off, the don't have beignets anymore, boo :(. They were fresh and perfect and the mascarpone cheese (that is also a goner) went perfect with the bread and raspberry preserves. Instead they do offer a raison cinnamon bread. I passed because I had my heart set on something else. . By suggestion of the waitress I went with the ever so popular Huevos  Motulenos. It is a mix of fried eggs, green and red chili, bananas, black beans, peas, and feta served on top of a corn tortilla. I loved this dish. The chili alone was wonderful and had just the perfect amount of spice and flavor. It also blended real well with the other ingredients. I wasn't a huge fan of the banana, but I do not really eat bananas anyway, so no shocker there. I could see how it accompanies the dish for those who do enjoy them.. I was told next time try to truffle eggs, which I intend to do. . Also, the orange juice was great. Some may not make a big deal about that, but a big glass of fresh OJ with a filling breakfast hits the spot! . It is great to see the success of this place downtown, and I will continue to be a customer and a fan!
I love breakfast joints and finding somewhere near North Las Vegas with a good reputation that's not part of some international chain. It was my first time here and I came with two friends. I was expecting a rush at 830am but we were seated right away and they even had a little awkward table for a group of three. I thought that was really cute. . . The service was great. Drinks and food came out quickly. The waitress made sure we were satisfied with our food but didn't come around often enough to make it annoying. They had a smile on their faces and made me feel like they genuinely wanted us to enjoy our time. . The owner was sitting out in the diner overlooking the operation of the restaurant and even pointing the staff to make sure things were getting done. I add this to point out the hard work and diligence that goes on at 'eat.'. . We started off with the strawberry compote and it was amazing. It disappeared in all of five minutes. (Split this with a couple people before your meal. You will not regret it.) The berries were so fresh and so were the biscuits.  The orange juice is fresh and a bit pricey. I had the Downtown Benedict. The poached eggs were perfect. I loved everything about this place and plan on taking others with me. It is a little pricey. But you will come out of there very satisfied.
Great eatery downtown. Local vibe. Big portions of great food. Be ready for a wait because it is the place for excellent food.
A co-worker told me about eat. being an amazing place for brunch a couple of months ago, so I made it a point to try it out this past winter break.  I came here with my husband at around 11:00 on a weekday and easily found metered street parking.  When we walked it we were greeted warmly by staff and seated within five minutes.  I love the hip atmosphere and decorations.  It was such a fun environment to be in and youcould see the owner going around to tables and meeting with customers..  . Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs so these three dishes were way too much for us, but Yay for yummy left overs later!  Here is what we ordered:. . Chilaquiles scrambled eggs - The sausage on this dish was savory and sweet and amazing.  The sausage was my favorite part of the dish.  The meat was halved and rested on a bead of eggs, cheese, salsa, and chips.  The salsa wasn't my favorite because it was a bit to smokey in flavoring for my taste.  Overall it wasn't a bad dish, but I'll likely explore other things on the menu before in re-order this dish.. . Truffled egg sandwich - I can totally see why this dish is so popular on Yelp.  It was amazing!  The eggs, the bacon (and I'm not even a bacon person, the ciabatta bread, and the potatoes.  I highly recommend this for first times to eat.  It will definitely be a great introduction to the food at eat.. . Short Stack - The best pancakes I have ever had.  They were super thick and fluffy and mind blowing.  A short stack comes with two 1/2 inch pancakes, topped with lots of powdered sugar, with jarred maple syrup on the side.  If you have a sweet tooth this is a must!!!. . When friends and family come and visit in the future, I will definitely bring them here for brunch.
After knowing the Chef's previous creations at PJ Clarke's I was looking forward to a restaurant where she could do everything her own way. I am glad to say her way is the right way. I love everything about Eat. from the restaurants decor and location. Both suggest an approachability and made me feel that this was somewhere where I can be myself. . The menu, as many have stated before, is not that big but I'd rather have a small menu of amazing choices than a huge encyclopedia of a menu with minimal choices. The menu were pages attached to a clipboard, another show on how unpretentious but subtly creative this restaurant is, and cater majority to Brunch items. All menu items, I was happy to read on the bottom of the menu, are bought locally and I could tell by how fresh everything was. . I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich which was suggested on Eater Vegas and the portion was bigger than I expected. It's eggs, bacon, mushrooms and feta cheese on ciabatta bread and it had a side of chive potatoes and a strawberry.  Everything was cooked to perfection! . Overall, food was phenomenal and staff was friendly and efficient. The decor was nature meets industrial meets modern. There's a food counter available if you're alone and prefer to eat quickly while on a lunch break. Check out the art at the entrance of the restaurant which feature aspiring young artists which I thought was a great move on Chef Natalie Youngs part because she knows personally how great a helping hand is so that you can fully realize your dream and with this restaurant I can say without a doubt her dream has came into fruition. I'll be back again.
I loved eat!!! My frustration was to go there and eat the country fried chicken breakfast. Understanding that breakfast ends at 11, we arrived at 10:35 and were told there was a 10 minute wait. That wait turned into 30 minutes, and when I finally was sat, the server and manager were unwilling to grant me the breakfast item I ever so craved.. . Not there fault though! The food was so damn good!!!
My boyfriend and I came to eat some delicious food and we were definitely not let down. I had looked up the menu earlier to make sure they had vegetarian options and I saw a few that sounded awesome, so we went. . . My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits and said "it was my first time ever trying shrimp and grits and I'm glad I tried it at E.A.T." They were butterflied shrimp that looked gorgeous!. . I ordered the Huevos Motulenos and I am so flippin happy I did. Seriously, I could eat this dish every day. They use bananas instead of plantains so it's a bit sweeter but it works well with the spice of the salsas on top. The potatoes that came on the side were massive and so yummy. I devoured the huge breakfast and would do it again and again and againnnn. I am actually salivating thinking about it right now.. . The only reason I gave a 4 star rating was because our server didn't check on us as much as I'd like. I understand not bothering people while eating, but there was a little while that we went without drinks. Nothing too major, I would definitely come back! I plan to soon... :}
Great find. Not something you might pick from walking by. The interior is clean and bright. Better yet the food is outstanding. Went with my brother. He said the Shrimp and Grits were outstanding. The waitress said her favorite was the Corned Beef Hash so I got that and he got the Shrimp and Grits. Mine was very good but his was outstanding. He had pity on me and let me have quite a bit. I live in the south and never had ones that good. I highly recommend this place.
This is our second time here and the food was fabulous bothtimes! I know the place is clean because there were three health inspectors having lunch at the bar (and yes they paid!). This is the new place we will bring all of our friends and family.
Great food and great service. Stripped down decor is appropriate. Place was jam packed and kitchen was slow, but servers were warm and attentive so it didn't matter. Eggs Benny were possibly best I've had. 42 for good coffee, fresh OJ, and three dishes between two people. Good value, great job.
This is one of my favorite places to eat and take friends! The inside is beautiful and comfortable. The location is right in the heart of downtown and across from Container Park. I have taken a few friends here and they have taken their friends here after their first visit.  The menu is so creative and delicious. Try it for yourself. . . PROS: Shrimp & Grits.              Killer Grilled Cheese.              Eggs Benedict.              Coffee (it's a special label)
Brad T. and I were looking for a place to eat around downtown and I checked yelp to see what was nearby and saw "EAT" with such high reviews.  Of course, we decided to come eat here! . . We went on a Saturday morning and it was quite pack, which was okay since I had time to read yelp reviews while we were waiting. I was getting really excited to try their food here and especially when I read that they had beignets!. . ....We got seated and I overheard a waitress saying that they did NOT have beignets due to the fact that the cold weather was not letting the beignets rise properly. ( I was so so disappointed!)  But it was okay, I was still really excited to eat their food!. . What we ordered:. Country Fried Steak (2.5): Unfortunately, I only took a few bites of this, so I cannot review it the best that I can.  However, the chicken fried steak was incredibly dry and I felt like it needed more flavor in it.  The potatoes were good though. . . Shrimp & Grits (3): I, also took only a few bites of this as well because I was also pretty disappointed how it tasted like. Maybe because i didn't like the fact that my bacon was soaked with grits.  But the shrimp tasted delicious and I like how it almost seemed like it was a soup, but it wasn't.  I didn't end up finishing it, Brad T. though finished it for me.. . Pancake (5): BEST PANCAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED! I absolutely loved it! I love how the top its crispy golden brown. Once you taken a bite of it, oh man! it its absolutely incredible! I highly recommend anyone to order their pancakes!. . . Service (2): The service was upsetting to say the least.  I understand that they are busy, but at least just come back to our table at least one time. After our server took our order he never ever came back to check up on us.  For instance, I forgot to ask for maple syrup with my pancakes, so I couldn't eat it until I had to wait for a server to look straight at me so I can wave at them. Overall, the service was just really upsetting.  The only time he came back was to give us our check. . . . Overall (2):  Even though, I loved their pancakes the rest of my experience there was just disappointing.  However, I would like to come back and give them another chance.
Highly recommend!! Everything I have tried has been amazing however, once I ordered the shrimp and grits I have not been able to order anything else.
One of the first places I think about visiting when I am up & early, and hungry. It's just wholesome, fresh food done right with a comforting feel and a refreshingly hip, clean decor. An unexpected surprise that is unique for the downtown area.  . . I almost always go for their short stack of buttermilk pancakes served with your own little jar of real maple syrup. Fluffy, creamy, sweet, homey goodness. Some of the best I've had. Hopefully more variation and play with the recipe in the future. . . Truffled egg sandwich is amazing. Soft fresh bread, sub style with the most decadent but lightest scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms etc. A must try. Also comes with seasoned home fries. . . Tomato salad is refreshing and light. Might just change your mind about the flavor tomatoes can posses. . . Other items to check out-Corned beef hash, biscuits with fresh strawberry compote/ fresh fruit.. . My only con would be that some menu items aren't available from time to time, maybe due to acquiring fresh product? (Paper & clipboard menu) I've also tried some other items that often miss the mark on just flavor.  . . Service from the lady's is great. Always on point and genuinely attentive. Nice, knowledgeable, caring. . . Parking may be a little ways away and most often, pay to park.
The food was amazing. I had the privilege if meeting the owner and she is great. I definitely will be back. Such a great addition to downtown.
I went here for Sunday Brunch (which f.y.i. is a slightly different menu). . Prepare to wait a bit, a sign of any good restaurant. . . They were out of the corned beef hash so I got the pancakes instead with a chicken apple sausage. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast type of person ....rather savory instead. However, these pancakes were AMAZING! I hold pancakes at a high standard because of a place back home that's been around before my grandmother dined there (Liliha Bakery, Hawaii).  The three pancakes are thick and fluffy,  have a golden crust on the outside and a very soft, moistness on the inside. Big bonus: they serve them with real maple syrup.....not that imitation fake corn syrup stuff. I will be coming back for these again!
Fantastic place for breakfast! The Huevo Motelenos were warm and filled the palate with Mexican flavored and spices with just enough heat. The shrimp and grits was phenomenal!
Bad attitude and bad policy overrides any kind of food here. No coffee while waiting - that's a first at a brunch place. Curt responses to EVERY question with a bit of pretentiousness that makes me say, "What did I do wrong?"  Perhaps Vegas is not used to brunch culture.  I cannot recommend this place unless you wanted to be treated like you're not welcome and they don't want your business.
I haven't sit down to eat the food yet and I'm already disappointed with the service. The curt responses from the person seating guests and not offering the same seating opportunity is terrible. Just a basic courtesy that I would expect was missing. The food was just ok. I recommend the sweet biscuits but didnt love huevos motulenos I ordered. It tasted weird with the bananas in it. I will never visit this place again.
Been hearing lots of good stuff about Eat, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. My only regret is that I waited this long. The food was delicious and flavorful. The owner even came out and checked on us. . . The only complaint is the noise level. Its all hard surfaces so everything echos. I would use a sound reduction acoustical material on the ceiling.  We will be back.
Eat has wonderful food. I think the breakfast menu is superior to the lunch menu. There are only 2 reasons I don't come here more often:. . 1. The place is regularly busy, which is fine considering it's a tasty and cozy place to eat. However, the soundproofing is nonexistent and it gets so loud that you can't have a conversation without having to raise your voice. Not my preferred atmosphere.. . 2. They need to serve breakfast after 11 on weekdays, it's too good to take off the menu when other places are serving breakfast all day. I really like  being able to order breakfast for lunch.
Hip diner feel that you'd expect to see in Los Angeles. Lots of people coming here from the local law offices and downtown businesses. Good coffee. Good hearty breakfast if that's what you seek. This spot is a fantastic alternative to the restaurants you'll find attached to a casino downtown. Make a reservation!
