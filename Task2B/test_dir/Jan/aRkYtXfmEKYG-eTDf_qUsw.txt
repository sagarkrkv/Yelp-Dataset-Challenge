After a long and exhausting day all I want is somewhere relaxing. A friend suggested this place! Which it was a great choice! A friend of mine ordered some dessert and I tried and it was yummy. As I am not a coffee drinker I ordered Honey Gensing tea. It was light but still taste the honey and Gensing in it. We were just there to relax a bit not knowing they have band playing for the NYE until count down. We were lucky enough that we found some seats that were on the front row and in the middle. We sat comfortably the rest of the night listening the band playing and was relaxing.
Staff seem happy to work there and very helpful. The breakfast egg sandwich is AMAZING and the scones are delish! Get there early or afternoonish to avoid the rush :-)
Nice place. I like the atmosphere. Food is good and coffee is good. It looks that the place getting good reputation as you eill see a lot of people.
This place is pretty great. Unlike some reviews, I found the staff to be pretty awesome. Even if they are in a bad mood, smile at them and they'll smile back! . . Their coffee drinks are pretty legit and the pastries are some of the best in the area for the price. It would get five stars if they had more selection of coffees but maybe it's because I like my coffee black. Overall, best coffee house in Phoenix so far.
The name of this place says it all. Such a lux place to sip on coffee, read a book, people watch and study. An even more lux place to order a meal too! Ive been here twice and the drive is always worth it. The employees are super friendly, people courteous of seats, very hip, a great find!
This little gem is by far my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix! Or at least this is what I tell people when I am actually skipping off to have a Bloody Mary and Mac n Cheese. It can be a little confusing going in for the first time because you can either order from the line near the entrance or you can go over and sit at the bar area and order there. If you choose to sit at the bar be sure to ask for Luke. I don't know much about this tall handsome work of art but I can tell you he makes THE BEST drinks in the area. Just tell him what type of drinks you typically like and he will whip something tasty up for you. Don't expect it to be quick though... remember... there is an art to getting the best drinks in Phoenix. Be patient and you will be pleasantly surprised!! . I keep telling all of my friends to visit this place but I think I am going to stop so I can enjoy my bloody mary in peace with Luke.
I am not quite sure why people love Lux so much. I mean its good... Great coffee. I pick up beans on the weekends sometimes when its not so packed. But the baristas are inconsistent, there is always a line 20 miles long, and the my dirty chai latte is always and I repeat, always lack luster... . . It's beautiful inside and if you like standing around waiting for a place to sit or crowded around the register then this is the place for you! The decor is shabby chic which I love and the teal typewriters give such a cool touch. The small windows inside allow the light to shine in, just so. If you do so manage find a seat, this is the kind of place you want to sit and write music or to your diary, sketch, or do something of an artistic nature. AKA hipster heaven. . . Breakfast here is really good though. I go to church across the street and sometimes we stop in here after for a bite. The bacon and eggs with a croissant are the perfect little tummy fill for a day of meandering around midtown. . . The thing I really appreciate about Lux (and what ultimately bumps it to 4 stars for me) is that they are a late night coffee stop. While most of the shops in the cenpho area close their doors at 7, you will continue to find the lights on at Lux.
Arguably the best iced soy mochas in Arizona. Perhaps beyond Arizona but my taste testing of mochas is somewhat geographically limited. I would hate to overstate. . . This place has really tapped the arse of every possible stream of revenue. Coffee... fancy coffee... freshly squeezed juice, homemade pastries, sweet and savory, packaged cookies, breakfast lunch and dinner, cocktails. . If you are lucky. Chocolate chip almond paleo cookies- but if you are GF, make sure to ask them to use a different spatula to avoid cross contamination!. . My only gripe - (gosh even typing that word I sound grouchy!)... is that it seems they ALWAYS run out of gluten free baked goods EVERYDAY, VERY EARLY. AGHH! .... Seems like quite the missed opportunity for them. They do a great job at creating what they do, but golly, make MORE. If people ask you all day for these things, and you are always out at 10:00am. hmmm... . . Anyways. When out of GF fresh goodies, you will be directed to bagged peanut butter cookies. Blah. No thanks. . . . Alright enough grouchy lady this morning! I do LOVE this place, love the vibe, the dutch pancake (savory) is crazy good etc. . . . Every Phoenician should know this place. Just saying..
The coffee is good, love the presentation and the pastry I had was delicious. Later I tried the savory Dutch pancake which was pretty good. . . However, the music at this place is too loud and horrible. I went there for a few hours and eventually got a headache listening to their obnoxiously loud and annoying music. Nothing soothing about it. Please change it up or lower volume next time. I'm into all types of music so it wasn't the genre or anything, it simply was not good and too loud.
I live right around the corner and love to walk over and get coffee. This place is amazing, the coffee was a strong and great.  Every single staff member that i came in contact with was fantastic.  . . I have not had a chance to eat anything at Lux but i am sure that it is going to be great.. . There are a couple negative points about Lux.  The lighting inside is rather dark and makes reading while there kind of hard.  The only other negative aspect is that sometimes there is a long wait for your drinks and people who order after you get your drink long before you do.. . But i know that those smallnegative points will not keep me away from Lux.
Cute little spot in Central Phoenix. The coffee and lattes are amazing. The baked goods are good but nothing special.
Nothing beats good coffee, homemade pastries and breakfast dishes.  Everything tastes fresh and delightful. The best yogurt parfait I had ever eaten, smooth, soft with balanced crunchiness from the granola.  Not too sweet, just right!  Wish I could have this everyday.  Will definitely come back to Phoenix for this place!
The coffee is good and the whole place has a great "roasting" aroma.
The honey latte is amazing! The atmosphere is a bit too hipster for this dad...but the java keeps me coming back whenever I'm in town!
How do you loose a good customer? At 5:24 tell them that they can not order the Mac and cheese because you do not start dinner for 6 minutes. Really, what are you McDonalds? You take the order and tell me it willbe a few extra minutes as they set up for dinner. Why would you turn away a paying customer? It was a to go order so the wait would not have been a big deal. I even suggested that and the girl stated that she could not do that. Major customer service fail. Like any customer I have a choice as to where to spend my money. I assume you no loner want me to spend it at your business. Drop the attitude
Hipsters = a subculture of men and women typically in their 20's and 30's that value independent thinking, counter-culture, progressive politics, an appreciation of art and indie-rock, creativity, intelligence, and witty banter . . Lux = Coffee house hipsters like to visit. . . I personally do not think I am a hipster, but when I walked in Lux, I thought wow if I were to open up a coffee shop this is exactly how I would want it to be, Coffee, Wine, in house pastries, plenty of seating, sofas, back room, outside seating, art work hanging, Yes this is the set up I would have, only thing I would change would be the music, I'd be more jazz and blues.. . It's close to Midnight on a Sat night and I'm a coffee drinking fool and am always into finding a local coffee shop, found out Lux is opened to 2am on Friday & Saturday nights, that's pretty sweet to me.  I read the board and saw espresso macchiato so that's what I ordered & asked if they could add caramel to it and she told me I will get a caramel latte.  Ok I'm getting the caramel latte then. . . My coffee order was up, and I have to say I'm pleased with the presentation, very swanky, and the latte itself was good, the creamy froth stayed though out the entire drink, you know how sometimes it fades away, not here, it was frothy creamy all the way to the last drop.  I enjoyed it very much.. . Now I just wish Lux was closer to me, I could see myself coming here often if it was.
Tried this place today on the way to the dog park with a friend. It was crowded and I felt a little out of place since I'm not super "hipster." My iced soy chai was super bland and watered down. I will probably stick to my usual coffee joints from now on. 3 stars for a cute location and decent price.
Perfect for the run of the mill gentrification experience of Central Ave. Pretentious.  But, great atmosphere (once you walk through the Macbook convention).
de LUX! I come here for one thing and one thing only, Lattes! Alright, fine, I come here for their baked goods as well. An eclectic crowd assembles here drinking their coffee and conversing, or deep in their computers. Lux is a very cool coffee house that you can relax for an hour or so or grab a joe and go. Definitely one of the top 5 coffee houses in PHX!!
