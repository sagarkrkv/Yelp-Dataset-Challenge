This is probably one of my favorite places for steak, bread pudding, or when I wanna eat at the bar alone. Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. . . We ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I'm a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!. . For dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!. . This is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :). . *Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!
Steak was awesome but very pricey ..service not so good thet need  to  work on that..
Went here with a large group. Good steak.  Sides were only decent. Overall a 4 star meal.  I would go back if asked, but would not plan the meal here. There is better in town.
Recently had lunch here with my small work crew (3 of us) to celebrate the Holidays. The restaurant was completely dead mid-week so at first I thought maybe we'd made a terrible mistake. My fears were quickly assuaged as our food started arriving. We ordered the lobster sliders as an appetizer to share between two of us, and our other colleague had the lobster bisque. The lobster sliders? Well they are the things dreams are made of, I'm still salivating over them weeks later. Lobster bisque was also apparently outstanding. Fries with old bay, perfectly cooked and tasty. For our entrees, two of us each had the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the other had the steak salad. The steak sandwich and truffle fries were absolutely delicious and I hear the salad was really fantastic. Service was impeccable and obviously we had the restaurant to ourselves, so our every need was catered to perfectly. I definitely will be back.
Great restaurant! The people were extremely kindand the food was excellent. Thanks to the Indianapolis Colts beating the Chiefs, house money paid the bill but I'd be more than happy to spend my "hard earned" cash here as well!
My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico for Christmas. We arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  Fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.. . We started off with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.  For our entree, we each had the bone in rib eye (I had the lobster with my steak) with sauteed garlic mushrooms and country smashed potatoes.  Our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   Side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  We ended our evening with the duck egg creme brulee.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had creme brulee in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  . . I cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!  Staff was incredibly attentive.  They have three servers waiting on you.   They constantly check on you and top your drinks off.  . . Like most fab steakhouses, Delmonico is pricey.  With tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.  . . Like I previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  I have NEVER experienced such great customer service.  . . When in Vegas and you're craving steak, Delmonico is a MUST!
Steak and sides were tasty although not nearly as well prepared or delicious as the food at Ruth's Chris. The pecan pie desert was actually the best part of the meal and the chicory coffee was horrible. Wine list offered $40.00 bottles of wine for over $100.00. Service was excellent which it should be when your paying so much money for your food. Ruth's Chris is much better steak and sides for less money. A fun experience but will not be back for a long time.
Yummy always so good!! I just hate the wait! ! But would definitely go back. The staff are so friendly there. I even got to meet the cook one time AWESOME
Really disappointed by the food.  I've been to several of Emerile's places and this one is not up to par.  I should have left when I saw the stained carpet in the bar and had to clean off the seat at my table.  My cold lobster salad was rubbery,  My fried chicken and waffles were so sweet I couldn't eat them.  Very sad to see this place so run down
This place was not special.  There were chairs in the hallway and lack of attention in the services.  The atmosphere was uninviting and cold.  The food was typical, not so memorable for the price point.
I have not written a yelp review in over two years, however after having Delmonico's I felt compelled to dig up the old yelp account to share my experience.. . I loved the atmosphere. It had a very nice ambiance to it. The lighting was dim and the decor was simple. Attire was dressy/casual. . . Starting with apps, we had the oysters and foie gras. The oysters were exceptionally fresh. No complaints about the foie gras. I also had the New Orleans Gumbo which was good, but I'd pass on the next time around.. . Main courses - Bone-in ribeye was fantastic. The seasoning was great and the steak itself was cooked to perfection. The portion was huge. (Like bigger than my face huge!) It was one of the best steaks I've had.. . Sides - I would highly recommend the sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the twice baked potato. They went perfectly with the steak. Both had good flavor and were prepared just right.. . Desserts - The duck egg creme brulee was good. It was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. I would also recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut bread pudding - it was scrumptious! . . I would say expect to spend about $100/pp. Overall I very pleased with my experience here - from the atmosphere, to service to food; excellent delivery. . . Kudos Emeril!
Such a wonderful place! Came here with a large party (11) and we had excellent service and food. I had the butternut squash ravioli appetizer as my entree. It was absolutely delicious! Together with my salad it was the perfect amount of food.. . The servers were extremely nice and accommodating for our large party. They served all the plates at once --  11 servers were gathered to set all of our plates down together. It was pretty cool! They also went out of their way to make sure one guest's meal was prepared gluten-free. . . They were more than willing to do separate checks, for which we were extremely grateful.
You're in Vegas what else do you expect but excellent cuisine from a world famous Emeril restaurant? Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. . . The menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! . . The must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.. . The next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. . . We will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip. But yes you'll need to save up for this one as your wallet may cry once you see the bill!
Beautiful dining room with exposed, double entry wine cellar with wine BINs from floor to ceiling.  Had a business lunch here and enjoyed every bite.  The Truffle Chips (home cut potato chips tossed in truffle oil, garlic, parmesan, and green onions) are rediculously addictive!  Great banquet space, able to privately seat groups of 12ish up to what looked like over 40.  Definitely would recommend.
Good for the management to reach out and connect with me.  I hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone.
Had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away.. . I looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so I kind of had an idea of what I would like to order.. . For our appetizer, we ordered two Parmesan and Garlic potato chips. I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. . . NEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!. . CAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.. . BONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.. . NOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.. . For our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.. . Can't go wrong with Delmonicos. Def give it a try! Be sure to make reservations.
