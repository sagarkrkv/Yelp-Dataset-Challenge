If your a chocolate lover, must go. If your not, go for the experience. Their chocolate is very rich, smooth, and wonderful. We got their lazy breakfast (eggs, mushrooms, potatoes, chocolate powdered biscuits), waffles, skillet, panini, chocolate glintz, and everything was delicious and rich. I would highly recommend the chocolate hazelnut smoothie, we all thing that's the best smoothie they have, it's very rich and satisfying.
Max Brenner's chocolate desserts are slightly overglorified and definitely overpriced. I didn't do a very good job ordering and got the urban smores. If you come here and are somewhat interested in the fondue, get the sharing fondue because that option comes with the little flame to make your smores and you get all the same elements (chocolate, marshmallows, banana, etc) plus a bunch more desserts to sample and dip into their chocolate! . . Ugh, don't you guys hate when you don't order correctly at a restaurant?! When in doubt, always yelp. ALWAYS. But there was no service (freaking Sprint) so I was outta luck.. . Not that the smores weren't good, but they weren't spectacular. So run of the mill I don't even know why it's on the menu. This is a restaurant with a mission statement dedicated to chocolate, a key player in the dessert world, so I expect every dessert to be superb. . . Anyway, their shakes are super decadent and tasty but also really heavy. I didn't want to move after a couple sips of my friend's hazelnut shake. Definitely a place to share dessert or you'll be slipping into a chocolate daze for days :D (no pun intended) . . Determined to go back and splurge on dessert with the sharing fondue next time.
Best mac n' cheese I've ever had.  I enjoy it with extra marinara sauce and no chicken. . . Salted Caramel Milkshake beats out their pure chocolate granita (their version of their frozen hot chocolate).  Both are pretty great!. . Turkey waffle sandwich was meh.. . If you are a chocolate-phine...come here!
On a recommendation from a friend we came here.  Can I say chocolate heaven?  We had the Italian hot chocolate with those chocolate pops .....very rich and flavor of chocolate so milky and smooth. By far the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted....I savored each sip.  The skillet was delicious and the toasted baguette with the chocolate sauce served as a mini dessert for me.  The sauce is soooooo good.  The waffle turkey sandwich was pretty tasty, but hands down waffle sandwiches from Bruxies in OC, Ca. are much better.  We even bought hot chocolate mixes for gifts and can't wait to come back next time with our kids.  Next time I must try their chocolate martini
I like their dark hot chocolate! But just the dark hot chocolate. The rest of items that we tried were just ok. The rest were chicken wings (I forgot the name but it wasn't the one with nuts on it), a shake and the popsicle fondue. I think the chicken wings got honey on top of it so it's sweet......which was not good. I have sweet tooth but I want my savory food not sweet. So it was a bummer. I think the shake is called the 80's shake. It has dark chocolate (menu said milk choco but I asked them to change it to dark), vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell. I though everything is blended in the shake but when itcame, it's actually a dark chocolate shake or granita, with a scoop of ice-cream on top, and the chocolate shell is on the ice-cream. So the execution was a bit not what we expected, and not appealing to us. Lastly, the popsicle fondue was way way way too sweet. The popsicle is made of vanilla ice-cream, which is sweet already. Then chocolate for dipping is milk chocolate which was way way way too sweet and passed the point of being yummy....I meant the dip wasn't yummy at all. And there was ground pistachio nuts and wafer balls for dipping to make it even more sweet. Don't get me wrong, I like sweet but only to its optimum level. I think it's a disaster when they make things above the optimum point. . . My husband got freaked out by the sweet chicken wings and doesn't want to try other savory items there again. I think we will go back only for the dark hot chocolate. Why? It's not too sweet, but has the real chocolate flavor, and not too bitter or sour. Some dark chocolate is very bitter and sour, but not the case for their hot dark chocolate. I like chocolate not because of its sweetness, but its distinctive aroma. When you make chocolate too sweet, that aroma will be masked and all you are tasting is just sugar, not chocolate.
Max Brenner, please come to LA!  The desserts are not cheap but they are to die for!  This last time my boyfriend and I each got a sundae.  He got the peanut butter one and I got the smores.  The peanut butter wins by far.  I would not get the smores sundae again.  But for the most part you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
I love milkshakes from Max Brenner! There I said it! Hands down the milkshakes I've ever tasted and experienced. Get the chocolate hazelnut milkshake, my absolute favorite. It's like sipping nutella ice cream. Whenever I am in Vegas, I have to stop by here and just have a milkshake and eat their waffle fries!!
Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.. . If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate.". . No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.. . We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum.". . The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars). . We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars). . Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.
Is it wrong to say we craved max brenner's every morning? not just sweets, the fish tacos were on point. mac and cheese was superb, and eating lunch became an occasion rather than a rush to throw food in our mouths. this is a gentle way for vegas to nudge you awake after a long night out.
I've been here twice every time I visited Vegas. Holy crap this place is bomb.  Everything from the sleek chocolat factory design to the food. The food is just amazeballs. I ordered an omelet with chorizo that can with fluffy biscuit. It also came with a warm chocolate sauce to dip your biscuit in. BTW the omelet was huge....I mean huge. Great service + Good food = made dining in Vegas great.
My Review is pretty simple...you love chocolate? You NEED to go here! Great staff and atmosphere, to boot! Truly a Chocolate Lover's Delight!
My gf n I ordered the marshmello pizza n it was good for couple of bits but after awhile it became too sweet n we couldn't finish it. Im sure a lot of ppl love this type of dessert but I don't really like dessert that's too sweet. we didn't try their other food like sandwich or burger or drinks but we did see some bomb looking food while we were there so next time i'll try them out.
Quick stop, you have to stop when you see so much chocolate! Got a few boxes of chocolates and a hot chocolate mug with a permanent straw. They actually have a chocolate bar where you can sit down and indulge, but we didn't have time. CThe service is very friendly and I actually enjoyed spending money here!
The chocolate martini was amazing!!! A little pricey but happy hour is from 3-6 which features nearly half priced drinks. The Mac and cheese was amazing but $15! . . You have to sit at the bar to get happy hour, which made the service so so. You have to save room for dessert!!
I fell in love with their Hug Mugs so much that I got a whole set for my relatives for Christmas! I forgot to get some for myself! . . Aside from that, the atmosphere was good and it's located in Caesar's Palace where all of the shopping is. So if you'relooking for a place to grab food while you're shopping, I'd say stop by this place, especially if you like chocolate. Price-wise, it's fairly-priced here compared to other restaurants on The Strip. I went with a group of 8 friends, and we each got different food items. Based on my meal and from what I observed from my friends, the food is good, but nothing too spectacular. I think the chocolate-items are the highlights and obvious stars of this restaurant.
This is quite possibly the worst place of the strip. The service is horrible and the food is bad and chocolate drinks are disappointing. . Over the past few years I have here a few times. To be honest the first time it was great! It was so good we complimented the manager on the wonderful service and food! The next time we were in Vegas it was a must stop on our list. This next visit was not great, the food was bad and the service sucked, but the chocolate drinks were still amazing...and everyone has a bad night. The next few visit we did not eat and the service was still horrible but stopped in for a chocolate drink anyway. . Well last night was officially our last night and I hope to encourage others to not waste their time and money on this place anymore. The service was not only bad but both the server and manager were extremely rude. . There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas that no one should waste their money or time on this place.
I only had the chocolate and it was amazing! Fondue and hot chocolate oh man it was great! The reason it gets 4 stars is because our server was possibly the worst ever! So rude! Never checked on us once. He was horrendous. I only left a 5% tip and that was super generous!!  If I were rating based on service it would be 1/5. If I were rating based on chocolate it would be a 5/5. I will be back!
Two words: Chocolate Martini.  This alone is worth 5 stars and was the best chocolatey alcoholic beverage I've ever had,  maybe the best drink I've ever had period-but you have to love chocolate and sweet (helllooo, don't go here  if that ain't you). Service was great, despite other yelp reviews, maybe because it wasn't that crowded. Come for happy hour  (3pm-6pm) for 6 dollar drinks and appetizers. Corn croquettes were excellent, sliders were very good and mini sloppy Max (pulled pork) were good. Not as memorable were the intoxi-cake martini, the banana fondue (fondue sauces were great but hot mushy bananas, not so much), and cocoa and chili dusted fries (they were pretty average but could not taste the cocoa). They even have a mini gift shop if u can't get enough of their chocolate....but be careful, if you're driving back to So.Cal., it may disappear before you arrive.
Service was slow the day my friend and I went. Server didn't even apologize for being late, but I'm not really going to complain too much because the food was excellent! Be sure to try a hot chocolate in a hug cup. I had a white hot chocolate with marshmallows and my friend had the spicy Mexican hot chocolate. Since it's Max Brenner, chocolate is of course on EVERYTHING. My friend got the breakfast skillet and it was so HUGE we didn't even eat dinner. Same with my Guilt-Free omelette with egg whites. Cute place for a girls-lunch, since it's in Caesar's and you can go shopping afterwards.
"A new chocolate culture". "Worldwide chocolate craze". . Max knows how to lure his customers in ;) . . Thought this place was another tourist hype, but it's so good! . . Service: walked in early morning, as they were opening. Waitresses were super friendly and conversational, helped us order since it was our first time. . . Food: . . Waffles!!! We ordered the strawberry waffles with white chocolate and it was SO good. Perfect waffles with little white chocolate sprinkles. . . Skillet: Probably the best skillet I've ever had, not just because I was hungry too.. Had all my favorite veggies :) . . Onion rings: a LITTLE bit on the not-crunchy side, but was still fantastic with the chocolate ranch sauce :) . . Fruit smoothie: a $7 dollar smoothie? What's in it..?! Maybe not worth $7, but really good anyway. . . *Tip: it's a bit hard to find if it's your first time. It's on the complete back of the forum shops (the mall with all your bourgeoisie stores ;)) across H&M!
I'm a bartender and my drink was made well. I got the intoxi-cake with white chocolate and it was wonderful. We also ordered the s'mores crepe and it had good flavor. It's really sweet so too much can make you sick. I'd advise everyone to share with at least 4 people.
Max Brenner's is a chocolate lover's paradise. I wanted to order everything on the damn menu when I went.. . My recommendation is to go for happy hour, everything on the happy hour menu is only $6! this is the perfect time to try a few things on the menu without having to pay too much.. . Get the chocolate drinks--they're unreal. The Satisfaction Guaranteed was probably the best alcoholic beverage I've ever had in my life, it tasted like chocolate-peanut butter milk. The chocolate martini was also great, but my friend and I both agreed that the Satisfaction Guaranteed was better. The OMG chocolate chip cookie was meh, don't waste $10 on it. Also, the peach mixed drink on the HH menu was fantastic, if you're not in the mood for chocolate with your alcohol, or just want something fruity, get this!
Came here on my birthday for some dessert. I had no idea about this place until my sister drug me here. It is a very small and unique looking restaurant but very good options to choose from..    This restaurant caters mostly to chocolate lovers which is right up my alley. I ordered the strawberry crepe and my sister and friend ordered the hazelnut crepe. Both desserts were absolutely delicious.
Honestly, I do not understand the hype with this place. The food was overpriced for small portions and nothing special.. . I had the Alfredo penne pasta, some fondue for two, as well as a couple of slices of my friend's oven roasted tomato pizza. The pizza was VERY thin crusted and had a thin layer of tomato sauce as well as some pieces of cheese and tomatoes spread evenly across the top. It was honestly like a few sheets of paper stacked on top of each other for ~$14.. . As for the pasta, it was again, nothing special. There wasn't really anything wrong with it other than the fact that it was ~$16 for like 4 bites. The taste was okay and was probably the best thing I ate there.. . Finally, the fondue for two was ~$25 for a plate of some strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a few brownies and cookies, marshmallows, and a scoop of ice cream. It was hardly worth the price.. . My experience here was really disappointing and did not meet my expectations. The food didn't taste bad but it was definitely not worth it. I will say that our waiter was very friendly, patient, and talked with our group a lot. If it weren't for him, I'd probably rate this place 2/5. I don't expect to be coming back any time soon.
I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I decided to go for my birthday! To be honest, I feel like I could've went someplace better. . . I'm gonna start this review with the BEST thing about this restaurant which is our waiter for the night. I didn't get his name, but he was so friendly towards our party and even gave me a birthday treat as a surprise! He was funny, nice, and didn't have a problem with us teenagers being loud. He was the best. . . Okay, now the food. I shared an oven roasted tomato pizza with my friend for $14 and it wasn't appetizing. The bread was super thin and it looked like it was drenched in tomato sauce and a couple of slices of cheese here and there. It didn't taste like a pizza, more like crackers with tomatoes. I could make it with a freaking easy bake oven. . . I also got the fondue for two, I think it was the one with the most items in it. The dessert platter came with a bunch of fruits, marshmallows, banana tempura, cookies, brownies, a chocolate shot, and the fondue. It was all really good in my opinion! Fun to play with and it all tasted yummy as well! My only problem was that it was $25 and I just think that it can be a bit cheaper. I guess I should've known the food here would be expensive considering the fact that it's on the strip.
If you are in town, you have to try their desserts.  The lunch and dinner menu is fine, but at least stop by and have fondue or a cup of their hot chocolate.  Not too many locations in the U.S. so don't miss your opportunity when you see one!
This is one of my favorite restaurants in town because even after 5+ visits,  I'm always craving another meal! The food is amazing. I know it's a sweet spot (pun intended), however, I've only had dessert once (we're always much too full from our meals). That doesn't mean you don't consume chocolate though - he is the "Chocolate Man" after all. Seating is available in their "outdoor" area, inside (surrounded by the bar and shop), or upstairs. All the seating is enjoyable with the upstairs dining area to be the most desirable (spacious and a bit more private).. . My favorite items from "Things to Dip" are The Smoky Dry Rubbed Chicken Wings ($12.25) with creamy bleu cheese sauce, Waffle Fries dusted with Chili and Cocoa Powder ($6.95), and Black & Tan Beer-Battered Vidalia Onion Rings ($6.95) with dark chocolate ranch. Really, really, really delicious! The onion rings didn't produce the same fireworks as the other two dishes, however, that dark chocolate ranch is seriously amazing. Can I get that with everything?. . "For Your Hands" choices, The Brenner Burger ($14.25) with Max's secret BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and vidalia onion ring and The Best B.A.L.T. ($14.75) with crispy bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and cilantro-avocado mayo, are both amazing. Same goes for their "Perfect Paninis" - the Grilled Chicken ($14.75) is made with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, and black olive pesto and the "Margherita" ($14.50) has oven-roasted tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, and a tomato-basil aioli. They all come with the addictive chili and cocoa powder dusted waffle fries. Drool.. . "Max's Flatbread Pizzas" are also really good and great to share. The "Meaty, Cheesy, Crusty, etc" Pizza (no longer on the menu) had Italian sausage, pepperoni, peppers, and crispy basil. I've also had the Ricotta & Mushroom Pizza ($13.25) with black olives and sun-dried tomato pesto.. . The Really-Cheesy Really-Crunchy Mac & Cheese ($15.75) made with a special 5-cheese blend, tomatoes, and smoked applewood bacon on the "With a Knife and Fork" menu is crazy good. I'm not even "Mac & Cheese" person and I would never have ordered this dish (thank goodness for Ruben), but wow. I couldn't stop eating it. The Sunday Mood Pasta ($15.75) with fresh tomatoes, spinach, ricotta, and tomato-pesto sauce is also, as you can guess, delicious.. . I've only been here for "Max's Brunch Therapy" once and I had the Hang-Over Omelet ($13.25) that came with a scrumptious diamond-dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit, spiced home fries (YUUUM), and pure melted chocolate (YEAH). You would only raise an eyebrow when you read chocolate with an omelet until you've actually had it. See, you don't need to order dessert.. . But, of course the desserts are amazing. I had their popular "The Fantastic Popsicle Fondue" that comes with vanilla ice cream popsicles that you dip into pure melted chocolate, Choco-pops (love these things!) and candied hazelnut crunchy bits ($8.50 for one, $14.50 for two). Interactive, fun, and tasty.. . I could go on and on about the food (I already did), but if you need guidance to just one item, it would be the waffle fries. I know it sounds silly, but they're so yummy! The chili and cocoa powders plus the mysterious "fry dipping sauce" really makes it pop. Also, check out the shop for more chocolate goodies, really cool beverage containers, and a free sample!
