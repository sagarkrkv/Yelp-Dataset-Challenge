Pub not.  Museum feel, open, patio dining, woodsy, with the feeling of it's the place to be.  With over 70 draft beers, and a menu as wide as it is deep = awesomeness.  A bit overpriced for the beers ($9+) and food is my guess for its overall low ratings.. . I got a free pint of bud light (Yelp check-in offer), and a half pound of beef brisket carvery ($19).   Super tender, and super good.  Came with choice of bread, and 2 sauces of choice (creamy horseradish and the mustard trio).. . Sports on the TVs, cool music, and a barrel of peanuts which I went ape for.. . The girls working here would be rated "normal", are wearing Daisy Duke type outfits.  At the bar, professional yet fun bartenders steal the roost.  Especially when double happy hours are promoted: 3p-6p, 10p-1a.. . All in all, a great outing. Thumbs up.
Overpriced bland food. Expensive beer on an expansive selection.. . Housed in the upscale Crystals mall next to the Aria Todd English's PUB has an air of old English pub with enough upscale to expect quality food and a steep check. It lives up to the steep check expectation. Service is good. Server wore a Steelers jersey and took good natured ribbing from the Seahawk's 12th man in good stride.. . Bangers and Mash: This is the quintessential English Pub dish. This is a miss. the mash was prepared correctly but tasted like a mix of fresh potatoes and boxed instant mash. The bangers.... cooked but no flavor. None. Literally tastes like someone pulled the bangers out of the freezer and threw them in a pot of boiling water. How hard is it to season your food?. . Fish and chips: Truffle fries were excellent. Fish was meh. Again lacks seasoning or any sense of flavor. Even Morton's frozen fish has more flavor.
Good food, fun and fast bartenders. We sat at the bar, I think it was much better than if we sat at a table. The oysters were delicious we did a mixed plate of half east coast and half west. Very fresh tasting. I enjoyed the potstickers very much, but my husband thought they were just ok. We split the ribeye. It was cooked perfectly. If you are up to the challenge flip the hourglass and down a beer in seven seconds to get it for free. Hubby completed the challenge, I took a pass. ;) Don't underestimate the desert. The brownie ala mode was one of the yummiest things I ever have had in my mouth lol.
I enjoyed Todd English P.U.B. very much. I ordered a mint chip shake to start, which is kind of backwards, but it was delicious. My friend and I stopped in on our way back from shopping and before getting ready for a show. After eating so much heavy food in Vegas, it was nice to be able to walk in somewhere and be out of there in an hour or less.. . The atmosphere is fun, and the location is great as it is near all the shopping at Crystals. I ordered the lobster cobb, and there was good amount of lobster on the salad, which made me a happy girl and I LOVE lobster. My friend had the roasted chicken pot pie, and it looked delicious as well. . . I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews. For what I was looking for at the time, an easy place to grab dinner in between shopping and a show, ithit the spot.
I like this place it was clean, and had good seating to watch football. drank a lot of beer! the happy hour was ok, I didn't really care for the options offered. oh wait the wings and oysters (strange comb yes) I took full advantage of... . . all in all nice spot for good food in casual setting and good beer.
We came to Todd English P.U.B. for a friends birthday after a night at the Cosmo ice skating rink.  I definitely wanted to visit this place, being that Todd English is a 4-time James Beard award winner.  Yum, I heard the place was located in Crystals mall, so what a great opportunity to Yelp and top notch place on the strip!. . We originally parked at the Cosmo and walked over to Crystals.  There's a convenient over pass, but let me tell you, the restaurant is situated in a little nook in the mall, so make sure you keep your eyes open!  Once you get in the place, you'll notice the round circular lamp chandeliers.  The lighting is a bit dim and offers a romantic/intimate setting.  One of the immediate focal points is the seafood bar.  When I went there, not much of the seafood was displayed, rather a bunch of crushed ice.  We were sat in the back where you say a cool exposed brick wall.  You got to see the expediter station and where the food was being cooked!  I love exposed kitchens.  It contributes to the intimate type setting, like you have a personal chef! Our servers name was Corey.  He was a cool guy, really nice and accommodating.  He checked on our table once in a while and didn't breathe down our neck which was very much appreciated.. . Some restaurants provide a basket of bread before the meal.  This place, oddly enough, gives a small bucket of popcorn.  To me, it says cheap.  I'm not really a fan of that.  I'd put that in the same boat as giving peanuts.  Not something I really expected from a Todd English establishment, but it did the trick.  For my drink, I got the Gnarly Head Pinot Grigio for $11 a glass.  Heads up, if you check in to Yelp, you get a free 12oz glass of light beer!  I got that too :) LOL. For dinner, I got the New Amsterdam burger for $18.  This burger is a 10oz beef patty, shaved pastrami, kraut, Swiss cheese, picklelilly and fatty fries.  I got the patty medium rare which was perfectly cooked, the shaved pastrami was nice and salty.  I asked for the kraut on the side, but should had it on the burger like it came.  Offered a tangy element and a light crunchy texture to the burger.  The fatty fries were little wedges, nothing groundbreaking but they did give a lot!. . At the end of the day, the place was better than OK. I wouldn't mind going back to try the seafood as it looks like a highlight to the restaurant.  Thanks for a great birthday dinner for my friend!
My review will strictly be on what I ordered:. . Lobster Rolls - I honestly got this because apparently this is one of the more popular items.  While these were decent, I would not recommend them to anyone ESPECIALLY if you have never had a lobster roll in the past.  The lobster they use doesn't have a genuine sweetness to it and they load it with lobster claws, which in my opinion, lacks flavor and texturally is off-putting.  For what it was it was decent, but being that it was DROWNING in mayo turned me off.  Lobster is rich as is, so let the lobster speak for itself.  For certain they do not use maine lobster (a more traditional lobster roll approach) because as I mentioned, the sweetness was greatly lacking.. . Sliders - Definitely get these with the truffle mayo.  I do not say this because I am hyped up on truffle, but because I truly enjoy truffle.  Unless you don't mind regular ol' thousand island then stick to that.. . Belgian Beer Flight - loved this, all 5 were superb and different.. . Sour beer - I absolutely adore sours and this tasted as if you bit into a sour apple and chased each bite with a nice red.. . OVERALL:  This place scream pub fare and is a great way to escape vegas life.  It made me feel like I was back in Cali at a local pub, enjoying some eats and brews with good company.. . Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!
It's a bit pricy, but can't expect much else around Aria in Las Vegas.  I enjoyed the chicken pot pie ($18), not being in the mood for a burger.  The filling was just the right texture; rich and creamy without being overly heavy.  Chicken inside was perfectly tender and crust was flakey but not dry and thick enough to really get something out of it.  Served in a large oval bowl which was more than enough for a meal.  Overall, excellently balanced meal to enjoy on a cool evening in the desert with a Belgian beer, or three.
Four of us went at 5pm on a Wednesday evening for Happy Hour/dinner. For HH there is a huge selection of draught beer and wines by the glass that are half off.  There is also a $10/bottle of wine special where you can choose from Cabernet or Chardonnay.. My brother had the  steak tacos and said they were the best tacos he's had.  I had the vegetarian option- the portabello mushroom sandwich.  It came topped with roasted red peppers, spinach, cheese, and aioli.  By far the best I've had, and being a vegetarian, I've had quite a few of these over the years. It also came with a side of pickled vegetables, delicious!. The parents had burgers.  Dad had the huge buffalo style burger, which came with enough fatty fries for at least 2 people.  Mom had 2 HH sliders at $3 each and was full.. We were impressed with the price ($105 w/tip) for a bottle of wine, 2 beers, 3 hearty, fresh, quality entrees, and 2 sliders.. Our server, Kimberly was super helpful and friendly to boot.  We'll definitely be returning.
This review is for when my husband and I were there on New Year's Eve. So, I don't know if this is how it normally is.. . It's a fun atmosphere, the decorations are fun, and they some of the tables have the opinion of pulling your own beers=pretty cool concept.. . They also do a think were if you can chugg a beer in under 2 mins.; they pay for the beer (stipulations apply I'm sure) but people were doing it that night.. . The service was 2/5-they were kind of pushy and not very friendly. . . And I wasn't impressed with the price. We got two beers, and the dirty chips. The bill was 45 dollars. That seems unjustifiably  high to me. . . Won't be back. Too many good places to try to bother returning to overpriced and mediocre.
Fried pickles were amazing, bangers and mashed were recommended to me by a visiting British cop and I loved then.. . You have to do the 7 second, it's easy if you don't picka heavy beer.. . English beer flight was well worth it as well.  Overall I will be back for sure.
Second time in Vegas, second time at Todd English PUB - . . Overall on both trips I found the food to be good - a modern take / update on simple pub food - this trip had the shrimp as an appetizer - good but I also feel like any place on this level shouldn't screw this up - and the New Amsterdam - that burger was great - good flavor with a lot going on.. . My only complaint for this place was prices of some items - I get that its in Vegas and on the strip prices can be a little inflated, but $8 for a PBR and $9 for a Bud Light seems a little steep especially considering I was able to order a great craft beer for just a few dollars more rather than having a BUD....
I came here for my friend's birthday.  She wanted to do something chill but had heard about their lobster rolls so that's what we got!. . Yay:. -Lobster rolls: nice buttery rolls, perfectly cooked lobster with a side of chips.  I'm not a huge fan of lobster because it can get overwhelming and tough but they cooked it really well here.  Plus the ratio of mayo to the lobster was good as well.. . Other:. -Loaded chips: Freshly made potato chips, with bbq beef ragu, cheese and some sort of cream sauce.  The bbq in this is definitely strong. Get this if you like the taste of bbq.  The beef ragu was scarce, barely had any.  One of my friends didn't even know there was beef in it and we had already gotten through almost half.  It's a huge order though, so enough to share.  I had to ask for extra cream sauce to tame the bbq flavor.  Chips were nice and crispy, didn't seem oily.. -Service: it was okay.  Our waitress wasn't that attentive.  It was kind of loud in there but it seemed like every time we would try to flag her down or say something to her before she walked off, we were ignored.  She also spilled one of our drinks on a portion of a table and never cleaned it up even after she said she was going to come back to clean it.
I did't have mane expectation and was pleasant surprised!
Place is pretty good but expensive! Almost everything on the menu is $20 bucks or more! Had the lobster rolls which was good. They have lots of beer on tap.. Pretty fun crowd. If your only in the crystal palace mall/Aria area this is worth the short walk but i wouldn't go out of my way to just come here.
Don't have to say anything more than these four words ... Brown. Butter. Lobster. Rolls. Absolutely incredible. I've never eaten that slow in my life. I didn't want it to end.
Stopped in after seeing La Reve and on my way back to my room at Vdara. It was later in the evening, so I just wanted a beer and something to ensure I wouldn't get hungry in the middle of the night. Well, I did get a beer, but I ended up at Jean Patisserie for some cold sandwiches after the laughable experience I had at P.U.B.. . Initially, my server came across like a pretty decent guy, but after a short time he seemed to be bothered by mother and I. We were obviously not a priority to him by any means. This was very clear when I watched him pick up my drinks from the bar for a moment, place them back down, pick up another party's, and walk out onto the dining floor. This was also very clear when he served us our appetizer before finally retrieving our drinks. Wtf? Is he new? No restaurant I've ever been to has thought that was the acceptable order service. I highly doubt that one founded by Todd English would feel differently.. . My appetizer of fried pickles was also ridiculously soggy. So much so that even though I was very hungry, I ate two bites and couldn't bring myself to take another. Sitting under the heating lamps too long while my server socialized with other, more familiar, patrons? That's my best guess.. . Finally, when I decided I'd had enough of P.U.B. for one lifetime, I ended up having to tell the bartender I wanted my check - minus the nasty pickles - because the server had put my table on ignore. It was like he thought, "Hey, they got their drinks and pickles. What else could they want?" He actually walked past once without a glance since setting down the drinks, but that was all I had seen of him for 10-15 minutes. Again, no restaurant I've ever been to has thought it acceptable for a server to not ask how everything is shortly after serving it. But perhaps I've been living on a different planet, or in the Twilight Zone or something...who knows.... . To summarize: This place sucks. With all the places to get a drink and bite to eat just in Aria alone, I don't understand why anyone would ever go here unless by mistake; like me. Don't be fooled about this restaurant, people. It's nothing like what you'd expect from an establishment boasting Todd English's name, and located in one of the most beautiful hotel and casinos in Las Vegas.
Awesome beer challenge and great atmosphere!  Games and great crowd. Had it twice. More impressed the first time with service but can't complain to much about my second experience.
I had the seare tuna with sake bomb..amazing..the lobster rolls were awesome. .and u must try the Dirty Chips..crey crey good
