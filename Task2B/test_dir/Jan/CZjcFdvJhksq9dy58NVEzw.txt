We came a few days before Christmas and of course we had to pay for the holiday pricing of close to $50/person (which was to be expected during the holiday; not complaining about the price). The line extended all the way outside and around the buffet. I took this as a good indication of how good the food was going to be.. . We were quickly seated (had the front of the line pass). It took awhile before someone came to get our drinks. Seem like they were a bit understaffed that evening.. . ONTO THE FOOD:. . Pho Station: . Not really a pho station since they didn't even have the pho rice noodles. Instead you get to pick either udon or mei fun (Chinese cellophane rice noodles; yes these were rice noodles but they're not the ones you find in your standard bowl of pho). The broth was either the dark broth (which honestly tasted like can beef broth; very salty) or the vegetable broth (which tasted funny). Definitely suggest you skip this station.. . Hand Roll:. To my excitement I saw sheets of seaweed next to the sushi bar. I asked if those were for hand rolls and the guy said yes. So I asked for a California hand roll...  Nope, only roll they make there is spicy tuna hand roll. Great for tuna lovers, not so great for me.. . Crab Legs:. They had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. (Good job! Crowd control.) Once you select your legs, you can ask one of the staff to heat it up for you. The legs were hit or miss. It's mostly just ok tasting legs with the occasional super yummy/sweet legs in between.. . Salad Bar:. Who pays for a $50 buffet to eat salad? I do! (Mainly because everything else just looked whatever... so sad) I have to say, this was the highlight of my buffet experience. Three types of greens you can select from. A variety of toppings.. . Dessert:. Lots to choose from. Portion was nice and small so you are able to try everything. I love flan so I had to try one of those. It was just ok. Didn't bother finishing it. . . OVERALL:. . Would I come here again? I don't think so. For that price I would rather eat at Bacchanal.. . What a disappointing first and last meal here :(
Came here for their New Years Eve serving which I'm guessing is different from other nights, but wow, I'm impressed.. . Beef Wellington, lobster, king crab, Alaskan crab, sashimi, caviar, etc., I walked out of this place in pain since I couldn't stop eating.  Yeah the price was a little steep at $75 for a buffet, but what do you expect when you have lobster tails right?  . . Oh yeah, don't forget about the dessert, flan, creme brulee...
I'm not sure about the previous reviews, but I definitely think that the Bellagio buffet has decreased in quality since I last came to Vegas. . . Price/Wait timeWe came a few days before New Years so of course, like any other buffet, we paid 'holiday' pricing of about $47 per person. The line wasn't long and we were quickly seated within 30 minutes (fast for 7PM), which worried me a bit. Really kind server; she took our drinks and kept coming back to check on us and refill our drinks. . . Food:. - If you love Asian food, or anything remotely related to pho, please DO NOT try the pho. They don't have typical pho rice noodles; it is just other Chinese noodles. The 'beef' broth is dark colored and very salty. It did not taste anything close to pho. It was more like canned broth, not really fresh. . . The sushi bar had tuna and salmon poke, assorted sashimi, and the only hand rolls available are the spicy tuna hand rolls. The spicy tuna hand roll must be specifically requested; spicy tuna and rice portions are small, but the seaweed used is good. Try the hand roll if you like tuna, but I recommend staying away from everything else. I've lived in Shanghai with the bad air and street food cooked with gutter oil so I have a strong stomach, but I'm pretty sure it was the weird tasting tuna and salmon poke that caused me to have diarrhea several hours later. BEWARE. . They had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. It makes it nice since there isn't a huge crowd fighting for crabs. The crabs were okay. I had some that I just ate ice. The crab itself didn't have much flavor. I just dipped the crab into some butter and added lemon juice on, but other than that, it was just okay. . . The meat was good. They had prime rib and kobe beef that I loved. 5/5 for sure!. . I think my favorite party of the entire buffet...was the salad bar. Sadly, it was only because everything else just alright. They have a selection of three greens and a variety of toppings and dressings. Oil and vinegar are on the side of the bar. Definitely get some salad and add some prime rib pieces into it. It'll make your night, since everything else...won't.. . Dessert was just alright. I didn't finish anything. Portions are small, which is nice, so you don't feel like you've wasted too much food when you don't finish. There is a pretty big selection. . . Overall, most likely not coming back. . Food: 2/5. Service: 4/5. Overall: 2/5.
First off, from Christmas to New Years the price goes up to around $50 a head - almost 50% for what looks like the same food that they normally serve.  Crab legs are split in half which makes it difficult to separate the meat from the cartilage.  They're also served frozen, and when I mean frozen expect more ice crystals in your mouth than tasty meat.  FAIL.  The "Kobe" beef was served almost well done which would be sacrilege if it actually were real Kobe beef.  The Prime Rib was actually the tastiest meat I had.  I forget which piece of fish I grabbed, but it had the juiciness and consistency of cardboard so I didn't bother with any other fish.  The mussel dishes were also pretty gross - overcooked and dry.  Most of the rest that I tried was pretty average for a casino buffet, nothing that justified the Bellagio premium or the holiday ripoff rate.  I for one will never be returning.
This is a quality buffet.  Bellagio doesn't disappoint.  Everything about this buffet is above average, from service down to the food.  It's a bit pricier, but it's soo worth it.  Every time I go to Vegas, I come here for lunch.  I really get what I pay for and it's Delicious.  I hope you agree when you take a bite out of a juicy slice of steak or a warm baked cookie.  It's soo good...I wish I could fit more food in my stomach to try everything.
I've been here three times, and each time has been a pleasant experience. The food is excellent, and the waitstaff tries their best to keep our drinks filled up, but a lot of the times, they are either understaffed or extremely busy and you would have to wait awhile to get your water filled. Overall, there is a great selection of high quality food. I am definitely planning to come back the next time I'm in Vegas again.
We came here on a Friday night after Christmas.  The price was high but there was so much food I think it is worth it in Las Vegas.  I later read that this was rated either number 2 or 3 as the top buffet.  The top one, I believe charges over $30 more, so I think Bellagio was worth it being less.
Due to the long line at the buffet at Caesars Palace, I came here for dinner before the Celine Dion concert. I thought the seafood and desserts were going to be good because of the price I paid. The snow crabs were all half frozen and I had to have them steamed before I could eat them. The desserts were okay but way worse than I expected. The Asian food was also disappointed: the Chinese broccoli was nearly tasteless and the miso soup tasted like soy sauce in water. The only thing I liked was the smoked salmon. The tuna poke was also good. But I don't think I will return any time soon.
I waited an hour to get into this place and for what? To eat mediocre food that I could have gotten at any other buffet. The only thing worth eating here was the kobe beef and a couple of the desserts. Those are the only positive things I can say about this place. The interior was nice but it's to be expected since it's located inside the Bellagio hotel.
Good food, nice service. No line today. Lucky me. This is my first time here. My first stop in Las Vegas. Everything goes well. I'm happy. Going to walk on the strip after this.
Variety, Variety, Variety, Variety.  No family can go wrong in satisfying multiple wants at this buffet.  If the line was stupid long I probably would not eat here, but we caught brunch at the right time and all went well.
$50 for frozen crab legs. I mean, it was honestly crab-flavored ice in a shell. The melted dipping butter was even lukewarm. . . The saving grace actually was the pizza. They had 5 different pies and the crust was tasty and the cheese was a good melty consistency. BUT I don't want to pay $50 for pizza. The prime rib was good, the ginger glazed carrots were phenomenal, the macaroni and cheese was watery. The dessert selection was just okay -- the typical cheesecakes and colored squares of mystery. I had a sundae (in case you were wondering).. . All of the food just seemed mediocre. And that makes me sad. Maybe I'm not made for buffets because I always expect fresher food.
Gluten free pizza available upon request. This is a sign of the times.  Let's be honest, Bellagio may not be the latest and greatest hot buffet in Sin City but it' never disappoints and you know what?  the wait time is not 1.5 hours like a few Buffets I won't mention.  The Shrimp cocktail here hasn't shrunk in size and they still offer a good selection of the staple common dishes as well as a few popular trendy items.  Personally they have the best pastry chef.  Case in point, their creme brulee.
I come here for the Alaskan king crab legs and that's about it.  Totally worth the money just for that!
Such a disappointment for the price :( Paid almost $60 for dinner during the holidays and it was a 2 hour wait.  The only way to get in front of the line was to pay $20 and that was way too expensive. First of all, they sat me first while my friends were still paying and the hostess said they would tell them to go to where I was after they paid.  After waiting for 10 minutes for my friends, I get a phone call from my friend saying they were seated somewhere else on the other side of the buffet. Unorganized and I just got there.  . . I went here after being turned away from Bacchanal Buffet in Caesars palace because they weren't taking any more people.  If this is your first Vegas buffet, you probably would be impressed because they do have a lot of food.  However, if you've been to Bacchanal Buffet this place is a rip off especially in the dessert section. I have a big sweet tooth so I love going to Vegas Buffets specifically for their dessert. I don't know if I came on a bad day but they barely had any dessert choices.  There was no gelato, crepes,  and they ran out of macarons. There weren't even any strawberries.  They only had some pastries, cakes, and soft serve, and I think the best thing they had was the creme brulee.  For $50 I expect a feast, and I definitely did not get that.  The only thing that was worth it was the Prime Rib which was delicious, but I can't get over the fact that their dessert was not good at all. The waiters were friendly though, but for being in one of the nicest hotels in Vegas, I sure hope they improve in the future.
We came here for New Year's Brunch. I would've rated it better at its normal price of $17.99, but at the holiday price of $35.99, it just wasn't good enough. . . There was a solid 30-minute wait around 12:30 p.m., but once we were in, it was free flowing. The service staff is very nice, but it was difficult to track them down at times when you needed a refill or new utensils. . . Food-wise, it just didn't blow me away. The Alaska snow crab legs and King crab legs were definitely crowd favorites, and the bluenose was incredible. The various stations also had some good stuff. But the sushi was completely off and the dessert wasn't up to par. The dessert! That's like the key to a good buffet. (Well, not really, but you get my sentiments.) . . Overall, go if it's the regular price and if you enjoy seafood. Otherwise, probably won't be as good as you expected for your dollars' worth.
We came for Sunday brunch and the price was very fair, about $37. The wait wasn't too bad, only around 45 minutes.. . I know you're not suppose to fill up on carbs at buffets, but man, the pizza was so good I could not resist. They has a seafood pizza with shrimp and it was for reals so heavenly *drool*. Also, the crab was great, the duck was yummy and honestly, I didn't have anything that I didn't like.. . . I really want to come back here for dinner sometime! So far it's been my fave buffet in Vegas. I'd choose this place over Wicked Spoon for sure.
It's been a while, but I definitely remember this buffet being really good. Honestly can't go into specifics because it's been too long, but this was definitely my favorite buffet in Vegas before Bacchanal opened up. Owe it to yourself to go and enjoy it!
We did brunch buffet here and it was truly delicious. So much variety. I most enjoyed the prime rib, chow mein, and carrot cake. Worth the money.
Lunch price is pretty fair during the week. $25.99 for a pretty great buffet. . . The standard salad bar is provided, but not as many toppings offered here than other buffets. . . They have the usual pizza, about 3 different choices. They have 3 different pastas, and a ton of bread and butter. . . Glad to see a sushi section. Only rolls for lunch, they later bring salmon and tuna sashimi for dinner (3:30 pm). There is also miso soup, shrimp cocktail and pre-made salads. . . Pesto mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and finally the crab arrives for dinner!. . The best part... Dessert. Almost everything was excellent... Except the chocolate domes and carrot cake. . . I just wish there was a little more variety here. The quality is very good for a buffet, but not excellent. I would come back hands down!
Definitely worth the money. Not the best of atmospheres.
We went for the breakfast buffet which is at $ 20. There was a queue outside but when we got in there were empty tables so don't understand the queue. The server was good kept topping up our orange juice regularly. The ambience is not so great though. There is an omlette live counter which is quite good n they have crabmeat and shrimp as toppings. There was also salads, pizza, softee machine, fruits etc. What we really liked were the omlettes, danish, almond croissants, turkey sausage,waffles. Most stuff was good. Pancakes weren't tat great though, there was a guy making them but I guess the backlog made them cold n not so fresh. The muffins were dry. Not bad overall though. Definitely worth a try.
The staff was really patient with my extremely fussy young son. The price is amazing and the food is delicious, especially for the price. Not the best buffet in Vegas, but definitely very nice, I would eat there again.
I would probably give it a 3.5, but I'm rounding up because it was great service and good food, despite being a little pricey.  Lots of stuff was very good--prime rib, roasted chicken and turkey, "blue nose" (that was the label....does that mean I ate dolphin? Flipper?! I hope not :-( ) and lots of the veggies, creamed spinach being the da best (also yummy--acorn squash, squash soup, broccolini, carrots, mini potatoes).  Desserts were good as well.  We made it for the weekday lunch (around $26) but came later, so we also got to eat the dinner food for the lunch price (since you pay when you walk in).  Overall good, but for the money, I'd chose the buffet at Wynn or Cosmopolitan's Wicked Buffet.  (Have not eaten at Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, a little pricierbut also probably great).
The prime rib melted in my mouth. I could have eaten just the mashed potatoes and been happy.  The carrot cake and brownie were superb. This is high end food prepared by professionals who know how to cook. Well worth the $35 I paid late on a Sunday evening.  The server was attentive and was tipped accordingly. My husband and I enjoyed the food so much, we will be returning again and again, and I live 3000 miles away.
I would love to give this place 5 stars but the lack of green bean casserole kept it from happening. . . The arrogance in the planning in the buffet is most apparent in the void that was not having green bean casserole.. . One year for thanksgiving my mother attempted my grandpas famous recipe and failed miserably.  She had been drinking since four am and ash rested on top of the over boiling gravy from what was at least two packs of stress induced cigarettes she smoked while trying to make dinner for 14 on short notice.  While she isnt much of a chef, the people here clearly are so why couldn't they perfect and serve such a simple dish?. . Get your shizz together and maybe next time you will get all the stars you deserve!
We went for breakfast on Friday Morning and it was really good and well worth the wait. I really enjoyed the eggs Benedict. . The buffet has a lot to offer and I really enjoyed that they would make your French toast right in front of you. The selection was above average and the food quality could be tasted. The waiter was very nice and kept our drinks full. It was about a 20 minute wait which we didn't mind. We would def eat here again.
The buffet at the Bellagio is my favorite in all of Las Vegas! They have a wide selection of choices from all around the world. I really liked their sushi and "Asian" cuisine. They have a little bit of everything for everyone so you cannot go wrong. The price is up there, but it's well worth it if your a big eater. . . Make sure to give them your players card to receive points. Also, if you go near the transition times you might be able to enjoy some "extra" options that you didn't pay for.
It was our first time eating here. The food was just tooooo salty for my taste such as the cream spinach and tacos. The Kobe beef was tough in texture. The strawberries were tart and not sweet. You could see that there were a lot of the staff  in the dining room area chatting amongst themselves. Overall experience was poor. It was a waste of  my money. Will not recommend.
The price was fair for lunch buffet.$22.99 for lunch before tax. Worth to try the steak and shrimp cocktail. Normal salad bar, pizza, Asian food. No sashimi for lunch. Desert was pretty good, but compare to other buffet, not much variety. Won't come back for lunch buffet.
Go here when you're extremely hungry. The Alaskan king crab was amazing, but a bit too chilled. However, they crack those babies up for you in half so you just need to scoop them out with your knife/fork. The smoked salmon? Mmm. They also have mini salmon tarts set in a little phyllo bowl - great bites. Dessert section? I prefer the strawberry tart - amazing. Prime rib? Always cooked at a medium, but the cooks will be more than happy to put it in the grill to increase that well-done-ness. They also have a sushi bar, and the chefs there can make you a onigiri with spicy tuna - yum. Service was pretty efficient. Prices are pretty okay considering they have that much seafood going on.
