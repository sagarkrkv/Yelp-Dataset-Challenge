I loved it when the waiter rolled out the meat cart. A nice education on the cuts of meat they had.. . Rib Cap - Amazing. All the sides too. The rest of the party was also pleased and they ordered Wellington, Filet and the Rib Eye. My picky friend who always complains about his steak? Well - he loved his. Shocking!. . Unfortunately, we were too full to try the sticky toffee pudding. I'll have to enjoy that next time!
Stopped by a few months ago and had 5oz of Japanese Kobe while the fiance had the rib cap. Let's just say that in a back to back comparison, the rib cap didn't even come close in flavor or tenderness (almost felt like prime vs select).. . Service was once again nothing short of perfect...looking forward until my next time out so I can finally feast on the beef wellington!
Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.. . Had the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.. . Staff was very attentive without being intrusive.. . We had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.
HAPPY NEW YEAR! . . I finally get to try this place out! It's a prix fixe menu for NYE... We start off with a Scotch Egg and for my dinner I've chosen the Truffle Risotto and Scallop, Surf n Turf and the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert with cinnamon ice cream butter stick. I also tried the Foie Gras and Hamachi as well. . EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS! . Babe also said I should try the Strawberry Martini - I substituted Vodka for the Gin and it was DELICIOUS!. . I'm not a huge fan of truffle but the risotto and the scallop were SOOO good!! Scallop IS my all time favorite food and they did it right here! . I ordered my steak medium rare - I did ask our server if they under cook their steaks and if I should order it Medium if I really wanted Medium Rare and he suggested that I still get it Medium Rare and it came out PERFECTLY!! Juicy and tastey and AMAZZZING! The lobster tail it came with was a small one, already buttered and SOOOO good!! I made sure to eat it all before trying to conquer my steak because I LOVE ME SOME SEAFOOD! . Unfortunately that didn't leave much room for the steak but I did get a few bites in! . The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was AMAZZZZING!!!!!!!! I forced down a few bites with the awesome cinnamon butter stick ice cream - ugh it was SO good! I really wish I could have forced myself to clean my entire plate BUT we had partying to do and I was in a dress and didn't feel like sucking in my food baby all night! . . Service was fantastic and the food was freakin' phenomenal!! NOM NOM NOM!!!
My husband and I took our twins here for their 21rst birthday. We all are long time Gordon Ramsey fans and have wanted to try this place for a long time.  It did not disappoint!  My husband and I had the Beef Wellington and it melted in your mouth. My son had the Prime Fillet and felt that the outside of it was a bit tough (maybe seared too long). My daughter had the American Fillet Kobe style and she loved it!  We had Mac n Cheese as a side; also delicious. We shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert and the caramel sauce was absolutely amazing.  The service was outstanding.  We were treated so well!  There was asmall glitch with the bill. They forgot to apply our vouchers to the bill (even though we gave them to them up front) and to void the transaction and redo...not that big of a deal...I just hate billing issues.  All in all, we were very happy....loved the "tunnel to London"! The meat cart was really cool and informative! Would definitely go back!
Are here a few months ago, truly amazing.  Service was top notch, use the wine sommelier...we told him our tastes and he was spot on with his recommendation.  We shared the Kobe rib cap and beef Wellington, both dishes were awesome.  You cannot go wrong here.
This place did not disappoint! We had wonderful service and the food was divine! The meat cart that the Mater'd talks about all the different styles of meat was very educational! Who knew there were options with meat? The assortment of breads with the Hawaiian sea salt & butter was awesome. The Caesar Salad we started with had the best dressing. I wasn't sure about the Scotch Egg but it was really good. The filet was the best I'd ever had & the sides were delicious! My husband had the rib cap with lobster tail and he is still talking about it today! .. I ordered the Cheesecake with Huckleberries and my husband had the Sticky Toffee Pudding-both were so good!
Let me start off by saying when you come to a place like this, the expectations are high, as they should be when Dinner is a $100 a plate. The service was excellent, the staff was prompt and attentive. We did not order any appetizers and dove right into our entrees. The bread selection was great, although the volcano sea salt on the butter  was a little gimmicky and didn't really provide much of a difference in flavor from regular toasted sea salt. My lady ordered the fillet, medium. It was prepared excellently, perfectly pink all the way through. It was delicious. I ordered the rib eye, medium. While being cooked well on the inside, it was very charred on the outside. To the point where every bite tasted like char. The steak generally lacked the flavor you would expect from a $56, 28 day dry aged rib eye. The sides were mediocre at best. The Mac and Cheese had the cheesiness and consistency of Easy Mac (with bread crumbs). The potato puree was ok as well, but nothing special. . . . If you are looking for an exceptional steak experience in Vegas, I suggest Carnevino at the Palazzo. Their steaks as sides make Gordon Ramsay's Steak look like Outback Steakhouse.
You can't go wrong with Gordon Ramsay. The environment may be a bit off from a classy fine dining, but the vibe is definitely there. The food and service here is amazing, and definitely worth the money spent. I would return to this restaurant the next time I travel to Las Vegas, though for those traveling through and don't want to spend the hundreds of dollars, please go and grab some coffee and dessert. They have a separate seating for just this and it is absolutely an experience you don't want to miss.
The space is really nice and has an open feeling to it.  Drinks were ordered from an interactive tablet - kinda cool.  It had all the ingredients listed and answered all the questions.. . They come by with a cart of all the meats to show you what you're ordering.  My friend and I bought the bone-in and ribeye and beef wellington and then split it.  They put each half of wellington over potato puree on its own plate, but the ribeye came on its own plate, and we had to divide it ourselves.  I imagine that was a presentation thing.. . Everything was dreamily delicious.  The sticky toffee pudding at the end was pretty good.
I went to Vegas for my friend's bachelor party,  decided we wanted to eat at a classy place, and ended up at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse at the Paris Hotel. There was 8 of us and the hostess gave us a short tour of the restaurant before we got seated. The waiter showed us a display of all the different cuts of meat they offered and displayed full knowledge on the wine selections (I tested him just to be sure). . . I ordered the English Chowder for my app, it was displayed nicely but tasted OK. I was surprised about my main course which was the Roasted Beef Wellington, this dish is highly recommended!. . Service was excellent, the manager came by a couple times to check up on us, waters were never empty, and we never had to pour our own wine. Only down side is that the portions were a bit small but that is what you get when you go to a fine dining restaurant so don't expect to stuff yourself unless you shell out some $$$.. . Overall it was a great dining experience! I'm gonna take the gf here on my next visit! 5 stars for Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse!
I was invited back by the manager Amanda about a year and a half ago. We saved her email and had a trip planned to take my sister n law and her fiance to Vegas in December, They are both physicians visiting us from Europe. So Amanda made a reservation for us on Saturday 12/21 at 7 pm. She was very helpful with this process. . . When we arrived we had a seat in the bar and was taken to our table promptly. We were introduced to Amanda and our waiter. First we ordered wine (of course) two of us had The Prisoner. We got a couple appetizers Foie gras, onion soup, and the beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything was very good.. . For dinner, two of us had the beef Wellington (very moist filet, melted in my mouth, perfect toasted phyllo dough and perfect taste). Kobe filet mignon was also ordered and that was very good, we got three sides, creamed spinach (very yummy), fingerling potatoes (delish! Omg yummy amount of salt and I believe Parmesan cheese), then I tried the mushrooms again and they were better than last time not too salty, my sis n law loved them.. . Dessert!!!  Exquisite, Heavenly, sinful, we ordered the toffee pudding. It came with toffee butter ice cream. The presentation was fabulous, the ice cream was shaped like a stick of butter and the dessert was a great size but we definitely all wanted more it was sooooooooo good. That alone I would go back for. So don't miss out on that, please. . . Hands down I have to say the service was phenomenal! The wait staff was exceptionally informed about the menu and catered to our every need. This is what you expect at a fine dining establishment and they definitely delivered.
The restaurant is cool and the service is amazing, but if you're looking for the best steak in Vegas, go elsewhere.  . . The breads, appetizers and desserts are scrumptious, but I just couldn't get over the bland sides and average steak.  I had the stuffed baked potato and it was terrible.  The skin was so hard that it must've been cooked hours before and then microwaved before being served to me.  The cheese sauce was overly sweet and tasted a bit off.  The tempura green beans were bland.   . . There was nothing wrong with the steak, but it just didn't wow me.  I've had better steaks at home.  When I'm in Vegas, I go to Del Friscos.  Their steaks are always amazing!. . Lastly, I do not appreciate being told how to eat.  Two people in our party wanted to try the tasting menu, but we were told that either the whole table needed to order it or no one could.  That is ridiculous.  I am a paying customer, and I should be able to eat what I would like, when I would like.  Nicer restaurants should be more accommodating and have the ability to prepare different plates for each customer.
I have been wanting to go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants for years!  So since I was planning a trip to Vegas anyway, I booked dinner there as well.  I was super excited!!! It's located in the Paris hotel and casino which is lovely and charming (unless you want to win money....in that case RUN away from Paris!). . . The restaurant itself looks lovely and modern. . . The waiter (I don't recall his name) was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful.  Although at times, he would get busy and we would be waiting 15-20 minutes for something.  It got pretty irritating.. . The food...I got the Beef Wellington and my sister got the Eggplant Wellington. Both were delicious!  The pricing?  Expensive...  I wanted to get the Ale Onion Soup...but at $18 a pop, I just couldn't bring myself to spend that much money for a little bowl of soup!  We also got the cheesecake dessert which also was expensive and it was about the size of my thumb...couldn't have been any smaller.. . In short, the food that we ordered was quite tasty but the prices were ridiculously high  and the service was often super slow.  That is why it only gets 3 stars.
When going to Vegas, I don't find myself being lured by the sound of the slot machines, nor the crazy clubs that peppers the city. I am more into trying the new restaurants, mostly by celebrity chefs.. . Gordon Ramsay Steak is located in the Paris Hotel.  The restaurant is designed to look like the chunnel.  The rail connecting England to France.  Located above, is what appears to be scribbled neon. Just scribbles.  The hostess later informed me that the design is to be Ramsay's chopping movement. Interesting. . . The ambience was nice. The staff warm and friendly.. . . Ordered:. ***Smoked Tartare : What a delicious show, comes to you in a smoked filled glass dome.  As the server lifts the dome, you are hit with a delicious smoke. Chopped, rather than ground, the meat was season wonderfully. . Petit Filet Mignon: Cooked wonderfully. ***Beef Wellington: Prosciutto and mushroom wrapped filet.  Quite delish.. . Sadly I wasn't able to have dessert.  :/. . Next time. . . . *** Favorites
We have long anticipated having dinner here and with all the hype over Gordon's celebrity and the Hell's Kitchen competition, it did not let us down. The service was exceptional: from giving us an ipad with the drink menu on it allowing us to email ourselves information on the wine we drank; to cleaning the table of crumbs and replacing the cutlery between each course; to placing our plates of food on the table simultaneously with 2 servers. The food was fantastic. Melt in your mouth, and even though we were stuffed we had to have the toffee pudding which was to die for! We will visit again on our next trip to Vegas!
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't quite excited to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I've been to the Fat Cow in Los Angeles, but it's not the typical Ramsay flair or fare. We dined in October 2013, and I can see many menu items have already changed seasonally, which I like.. . Steak met every one of my expectations. We sat in a more private room on the second floor and though we were right next to the central walkway to the room, the staff was considerate and tried to give us space and privacy. I began with the Foie Gras, as it is illegal in California, and my heart melts over a properly cooked Foie Gras. Sure enough, it was moist and soft, and came with a pumpkin waffle. I've got to say the thought of a waffle cheapened up the dish, but the flavors and textures were spot on.. . Before ordering, we were shown a cart of the different steak cuts they offer and explained the difference between each. Don't come here if you're an animal activist vegan (though the name Steak should have told you that).. . With dinner, I had a glass of Justin cabernet and though it is the cheapest cab on the menu, it is a fantastic choice from Paso Robles. I couldn't resist a Beef Wellington, and I was happy to receive a perfectly cooked dish. Fine dining is often associated with small portions, but between the appetizer and main course, I was completely satisfied.. . Thank you for a wonderful meal.
Food . ======. $52 Beef Wellington. $17/18 Kurobuta Pork Belly. $18 Clam Chowder. $10? HX Antioxidant Cocktail. $44 Fish & Chips. $6 Heineken. . The chips in the fish & chips was nice, as was the Antioxidant cocktail. Rather straightforward recipe, but it is awful rare to see acai berry liqueur. The Pim's Cup looked rather delightful as well. . . The clam chowder was decided all-round as weird and disappointing. It was my mother's main dish and she didn't like it at all.. . The pork belly was recommended as the crowd favorite from the appetizers and I know I wasn't impressed, but if it's kurobuta, then I've had it in Japan by people that seriously worship the animal. It couldn't compare. . . Lastly, the Wellington. My fandom of it and my tastebuds disagreed. I want to say I liked it but I'm pretty sure I didn't. Pastry dough is often my favorite part of a pastry (like pie crust, or pate chaud), but on the Wellington it played such an insignificant part. Then the prosciutto. I loooove prosciutto. Throw it on pizza, eat it on crackers or spinach or mozz cheese. Mmmm. In the Wellington, it was a brown limpid thing. As for the steak, it was cooked to preference, but beyond that, I don't remember much flavor. As high end restaurants I've been to go, Mastro's Steakhouse in Costa Mesa, CA was soooo much better. . . Decor. =======. All red, dark, and moody. As a popular restaurant, I think they needed more chairs than were comfortable, because I honestly did not like our seat. Across the way from us was a nice alcove, those bud-shaped booths that use the seats as walls, but they tower to the top for privacy. . . The light arrangement in the center is supposedly the motions of Ramsay as he makes the Wellington. It's also the same pattern imprinted on the menus and who knows what else. . . Service. ======. The female servers are all dressed in the same black dress, which gives it a nice Vegas. There is the meat block with the explanation - helpful. The service was neither superb nor awful, so I guess that means it falls right at mediocre. Someone else was right; some of the policies just kill you, like with the tastings. My mini-hurt was that everyone at the table had to place their order at once. I was set on Wellington the minute we decided we were going to Ramsay but it takes 30/40 minutes or so to prepare from the moment you order it, and while I would've liked to order it as we placed our drink orders, had to wait till the rest of the entrees were set to order as well. . . Extra!. ======. - Even without a reservation, seating is pretty quick. . - I think they ask everyone to go to the bar first; just their thing.
I had the bone-in ribeye -- twice.  I've had steak all over LA and I have to say this is at the top of my list.  The service was also exceptional and everything we ordered, including beef tartar, fish and chips, and sticky toffee pudding were amazing.  The next time I go to Vegas, I will definitely be back.
Great steak which was the most important thing, got the Porterthouse for two.  The stuffed potato was minimalistic (not stuffed) and totally uninspiring.  Waiter was a good guy, hostess was a post high school vacuous tart who clearly wasnt listening.
Be prepared to pay a little here. We of course had to come because we love Hell's Kitchen, as I'm sure that is why most people go there. We sat next to the kitchen, which was great for me, because I love cooking and watching. My hubs just decided to splurge because we will never be there again. You only live once right?! I was thoroughly impressed with the iPad wine menu and drink menu. Lots of wines, but they weren't price friendly. They should have more wines priced under $75 a bottle. Not everyone can afford this and the average population that watches this show are of middle class. Service was excellent. We ordered the Pork Belly for an appetizer, although the flavor was there, we really only got to experience a little bit of meat, it was mostly fat. We have had way better pork belly in Germany and other places. $18 for 2 little bites of meat is not worth it to me. My husband liked the meat displayed that they personally brought to the table. I was a little turned off by it. We decided to order the Wellington being fans of HK, but mine was cold in the middle. So after all said and done, we spent a total of $230 for just my husband and me. We didn't even have dessert. I guess we can say we've been there!
Saturday night for 6 people we didn't get a table until 10pm.  We we shoved in a hidden room meant for small banquets,  The decor was average  dark wood paneling etc. The staircase was sort of nice 26 stairs my friend counts stairs.  . . We started with 15$ drinks at the lounge.  The antioxident was very tasty with acai liquor and lemon,. . Three people ordered the wellington and we waited the 45 mins.  I don't love red meat but when in a steak house I can't eat the fukishima Pacific salmon can I?. The filet was as expected perfectly cooked and lovely.  People loved their wellington, though commented that is is slightly over salted.  I expect that from American cuisine though.. . My complaint is that the mac n cheese with truffle was delicious, though salty,  the side of asparagus for $13 dollars was cool.  In fact all my food felt like it was not hot but like it rested for ten mins.  . . The male waiter parade for food service was fun.  6 men bringing food. Though the forgot 2 items.. . I had the french press coffee which was over cooked.  It shouldn't be longer than 4 mins.  When I quizzed the waiter on serving time he didn't know.  The chocolate served with it was cool. very European.. . Overall people were satisfied.  For such fine dining at over $100/pp  I expected excellent food service and hot delicious food.  None was provided.  Very average.  It felt more touristy delicious and not foody delicious.  I want a mouth orgasm!! . . I would pass next time.  Though good no one craved a return experience
Wellington, toffee pudding and Mac and cheese was DELISH!!!!!! My friend had the steak and they said it was amazing ;)
The stars given are strictly for the food, which was amazing.  We were extremely disappointed in the service here.  Maybe because it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant the staff is supposed to be aloof and not very accommodating- taking on Gordon's television personality of hard-ass, but we were not impressed and aren't likely to go back, we'll happily go back to our usual Craftsteak while in Vegas where the food is amazing and service is superb every time.  . We sat at the bar and our bartender didn't pour me a taste of the wine I ordered, just poured the glass and walked away, luckily I was happy with it.  The bread selection was great- 1 star for that.  We ordered a filet, bone marrow, spinach & potato puree- all was amazing- 1 star for that.  We let our bartender know we were sharing, apparently he couldn't be bothered to communicate that to the kitchen or runners, the steak was placed in front of my bf, the bone marrow between us and the sides at the top of my bf's setting... not even a warmed plate was left for me- apparently they thought I wasn't eating or was going to eat off of my bf's plate while in a nice dress and he was in a suit... far too likely i would have spilled on us so we asked for an extra plate.  When I've ordered bone marrow at other upper steak restaurants it is served with toasted bread, makes sense right?  Ours was not and when we asked our bartender for some sort of toast or bread he acted annoyed and like we were asking for something ridiculous or out of the ordinary.  . We weren't really checked on, we weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks, I don't remember being asked if we wanted dessert- everything we ordered was well worth the price because it was delicious, but don't expect friendly, courteous service as being included in the price.. A week later after we were back home my bf was checking on all of his charges from our trip and was surprised by our lower than our norm total for an upper steak restaurant dinner out- I reminded him we didn't have a friendly, chatty, helpful bartender who cared to find out we are usually 3-4 drinks each diners and we never got the chance for a second round.  . Too bad for you Gordon Ramsay, your staff didn't pump us for the $$ you could have made off of us.
Had to go here because we're huge Hell's Kitchen fans. Be prepared to fork out $100-200 easy. Our's was right at $200 for a appetizer, wine and our wellingtons. The Ipad wine menu was amazing and very impressive. Our 2 waiters were very impressive and that just set the bar for how every waiter/waitress should be. Very very very expensive wine available or you can get the $45 bottle like we did. Wish they had more wine for less for the middle class. The $18 pork belly wasn't worth it. Full of flavor but also fat.. The Wellington's were amazing. We cut down the middle. My wife said hers was almost cold, mine was pretty warm. All I have to say, is I love wellington's!! . If you only have 1 place to splurg once a year, this is your place. Dress up and have a hot, nice, relaxing date night!
Our group found our steaks to have too much fat to meat ratio, which was a bit disappointing, however the sides were out of this world.  The beef Wellington is what you want to order here.
This place was great!...its not in one of the newer and hotter hotels on the strip (Paris), butnthe food and service were spectacular. I went with all the signatures and they didint disappoint.  Beef Wellington was tender, juicy and full of flavor and for dessert we had the Toffee pudding. MAN O MAN the thought of toffee flavored pudding put me off a little bit, but damn I was wrong, it might be one of the best desserts ive ever had. The drinks,apps, and service were top notch, I really recommend a visit.
I wasn't sure if there were cameras around, because it felt like I was in Hell's Kitchen. We ordered the pork belly, poached lobster, smoked beef tartar, all were delicious. First course, market salad and English chowder, not impressed. Second course, 24 oz rib chop, 18 oz NY strip and chicken with tikki masala spices, all unpleasant. Third course, sticky pudding, some cheese cake, these were good. . . Here comes the worst part, we ordered drinks all specialty cocktails, before we can say anything else our server bolted. A busser quickly gave our waters and breads, cocktails come in 15 min, apps next 15, at this point we have finished apps, drinks and half the bread plate, main course 1 hour 48 min after cocktails were served, dessert took another 33 min after we were done. We didn't even finish our main course we were so full from waiting. We had to ask server where are food was and all he said was it comes out when done, WHAT? But i see the manager on duty coming out the back, mouth full of food and didn't even come by to see how we were. Clearly we looked frustrated with our hands to our heads or face looking very disturbed.. . I know this business well, and understand it can be busy or kitchen maybe overwhelmed but to have managers and servers like we had was an epic fail for this place. I have booked a group here and they were so happy with everything. We just happen to be there when the drop out staff were working.. . Im so disgusted and upset that i don't even want to bring any business here anymore. Go to Stripsteak instead!
I wholeheartedly wish Gordon Ramsay would read this review himself or any management level that run this location.  We went to your restaurant on December 25th to celebrate Christmas as a couple and enjoy a wonderful experience of food and dining.. . The saving grace for 2 stars is because the food was actually great, everything else was just "sad".. . We were 10 mins ahead of our reservation.  Walked up to the hostess' area to get laser scanned treatment from head-to-toe from their "Queen Bee" hostess (the one that stood behind the podium and the only one who wore ballet flats) I don't think even TSA did that to me.  Husband told her our reservation time, and we got evil eyes flying draggers throwing at our direction from all 5 of them. We had interrupted their gossiping session.  The response was that we could go in and get a drink or wait outside as our table wasn't ready.  Then, the 5 of them went back to their gossiping session. P.S. We were dressed according to their dress casual - jacket, heels, cocktail dress etc.. . So eventually we decided to go in and get a drink and wait.  One of their hostess's job is to open the door, nothing more or less.  She won't tell you the direction or hook you up with a chair or give you the drink menu or anything.  She apparently is there to only open and hold the door. A door stop can take care of it if that is the personal touch Mr Ramsay was looking to achieve.  . . We adventured our way in the bar area, standing awkwardly.  Husband pushing his way through the wave of diners to the bar, obtained the drink menu from the bartender.  Mission achieved! We finally sat down and moved to a corner table, a cocktail waitress came up with the iPad with all the drinks in it.  Ah, I was in a better mood at the point.  The cocktail waitress came up and asked what we wanted to drink, and we were about to put in the order.  Our "lovely" hostess popped right to our face and told us our table is ready.  An evil eye sight exchange happened between the cocktail waitress and the hostess.  Not sure this is the theme of this restaurant - plenty of cat fight atmosphere or they took pleasure creating  an uncomfortable setting for the patrons.. . Move forward, we arrived at our table.  Further sad atmosphere.  There were about 5 tables that are located at the back corner of 1st floor.  All I can see is the entrance of the staff area, not the kitchen cooking area.  It is literally the entrance of the staff before they get on the dinning area.  You can elbow your next table.  I in fact we ended up starting a little chitchat with next table diners.  It is pretty normal in New York City restaurants, but not in Peter Lugers, Charlie's in Florida, or even Morimoto, or his arch-rival's Mesa Grill.  "Steak" was frankly not in the same level steak house that Gordon Ramsey would even be willing to compare himself.  Some simple screens or other aesthetics would easily correct this, but it certainly needs something.. . We ordered a bottle of red, Onion Soup, Beet Root Salad, Rib Cap, Beef Wellington, Grilled Asparagus, Chocolate two-way, Toffee Pudding.  I like the vegetables and side dishes more than I do with Beef Wellington.  Little that I know I forgot to order the sauce, and of course our waiter didn't bring that up or even provide advice on how we should do it.  In fact, my husband goes to fine restaurants and relinquishes control to the chef.  His feeling is that if he is going to be eating top-level cuisine, he should trust the chef's tastes.  The waiter stated that everything must be put in the same time, and if you forgot something and do not know your way around ordering...yup...pretty much SOL.. . I adored the kitchen staff and their work, but front of the house probably the worst I even seen in the same category.. . In all fairness, I like Gordon Ramsay's Rib Cap more than Bobby Flay's Rabbit dish, but I don't think I would come back to this exact location again.  Mr Ramsay, please do your magic and correct the situation there.
Absolutely the BEST steak I've EVER had!!! Perfectly prepared. Had a dozen raw oysters on the half shell which were excellent. No fishy smell or aftertaste. The sides tasted unbelievable. I had the asparagus, mashed potatoes & Mac  and cheese. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be eating here again.
Fabulous coffee and donuts!!!! Dennis and Johnny were amazing!! And the beef Wellington was pretty good too!!!
After such a great experience back in July (see Gregg M's review) we decided that this would be the perfect spot to go for a wedding "reception".  Special thanks to Sandra B from group sales at Total Rewards for making this group reservation for us.. . The meal was everything I wanted it to be - impeccably delivered and absolutely delicious.  I could not have asked for better service.  I would say there was only one thing that may have put a damper on things had I not been in such a wonderful mood - but more on that later.  My husband and I decided to get the Hells Kitchen tasting menu.  We chose not to get the wine pairings since we wanted people to get what they felt like drinking, rather than be limited to what was part of the wine pairings.  The sommelier was on hand to help us out with decisions.  . . i personally decided I wanted a cocktail to start out with - though I don't remember the name of it, it was delicious with cucumber and gin and other subtle flavors that made it very refreshing and a perfect beginning to our meal.  . . As with our previous visit, the amuse bouche and third course were exactly the same as our previous visit.  The scotch egg was as delicious as I remember it from July andthe Beef Wellington - sublime.  Though I will say after making it with a friend for New Years, I wish I this version would have had more of the duxelles that helps make the Wellington what it is - delicious . . The differences:  The first course was a beet salad.  Perfectly roasted beets with a hint of horseradish and the second course - though it was a scallop risotto, the risotto was made with farro, black trumpets and pecorino cheese (I have to say I think I liked the differences!).  . . Though this was not a different course - it bear mentioning all by itself.  Dessert.  How can you not like brown butter ice cream?  Pair that with some sticky toffee pudding and you have the best dessert ever (yes even better than chocolate!).   Heaven!. . The only down side was the cognac service.  I really wish they would have explained to all of my guests what cognacs they had and what the price points were.  They brought out the Louis the XIII for this service ($200/glass) as well as some other much less expensive choices.  Though there were a few people who know cognacs and can truly appreciate the differences in a Louis XIII, I'm not sure if all of the guests that ordered Louis XIII would have, had they known its cost.  For the most part - some only saw the pretty bottle.  . . Even with this one slight hiccup - We still had a 5-star experience.  Thanks for a great meal!
This is a fantastic restaurant with a great vibe tucked into Paris Las Vegas. Tried going here two years ago, but they weren't open yet. And since I am regularly in Vegas for business and we are huge Ramsay fans we decided we would try it. . . We did the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairings. Each dish was superb. The Wellington, was out of this world and the wagyu rib eye melted in your mouth. The drinks were stuff and always refilled. . . Donnie and Eric were fantastic. Definitely one of our favorites on the strip.
Oh how I love this place for a great steak. Surprisingly the place is pretty casual. My order of an 8 oz. Kobe beef (American Wagyu) Rib Cap in medium rare is definitely a winner. It really melts in your mouth. For side orders we had Fingerling Potatoes which is a little on the salty side, and Spinach sauteed with Parmesan cream. With a couple of drinks, just be prepared to spend over $100/pp because even just a bottle of water (imported from Wales) will cost you $8. But, hey it's Vegas. We'll probably go back only for special occasions.
Demi roasted bone marrow and brioche... need I say more?. . I recommend you stop eating 24 hours previous to your reservation, as you'll be shoveling marrow smeared brioche in your food hole as though you were playing chubby bunny for your life!. . Mmmm that brioche. Give me a minute. MMmm. Oh! Everything else was excellent too!
I love good food. I like great service. I enjoy hip atmospheres. Not only did Gordon Ramsey Steak deliver on all fronts, it blew past all expectations and flew through the roof.. . It's all been said: look at the sheer number of reviews this place has. But I'll never forget the Alaskan king crab. Or the mac n cheese. Hell, even the sticky toffee pudding was some of the richest and most decadent I've ever tasted. That's right; I've written two paragraphs without one word mentioning beef.... That's because I don't eat beef and yet I'd come back to this spot in a heartbeat.. . Our party of 5 had a range of dishes..... From oysters, foie gras and crab legs to start to tuna, sea bass, beef wellington and an actual steak for our mains. The sides were Just as tasty as the mains and dessert mixed with coffees and chocolate spoons filled with liqueurs just topped the entire experience. . . We had too many cocktails and enough wine for a village .... Which made it all the better. If you're looking for a mouth-watering dining experience....... This is your place.
2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100. . Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!. . GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.. . We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.. . While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.. . I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.. . Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.. . They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.. . What we ordered:. . --BREAD--. Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!. . --DRINKS--. PIMMS CUP: . Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.. . WYDERS PEAR CIDER:. The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!. . --STEAKS--. BEEF WELLINGTON:. So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.. . KOBE FILET MIGNON:. My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!. . --SIDE DISH--. TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:. I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!. . --DESSERT--. STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!. . Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!
Expensive, but worth it. Lots "wow" factors. We want to go there again.. Ramsey's "Hell's Kitchen" winner, Chef Christina Wilson works there, she was very kind and friendly.. . We had a new years eve course. . Each of us (4) ordered different selections; oyster, beef tartare, Kurobuta pork belly, Hudson Vally Foie Gras, Hamachi Crudo, and more.... . Coffee comes with complimentary three different chocolates melted on spoon,. They gave each of us a complimentary gift bag at the end of dinner with Gorden Ramsey's autograph on his photo and menu inside the bag. . . Service was great, waiter/waitress kept eyes on customers.. Awesome experience.
My husband and I wanted to have something special for our anniversary so we decided to fly in to Vegas to have dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak and OMG this place is freakin awesome!  Service and food was really good! I took away one star because the place was not as romantic and high class as I thought it would be.  The music was way too loud.. . Our menu consists of:. . Half dozen of fresh oyster - there's oysters from different areas and it was extremely fresh!. . Hamachi Crudo - topped with unagi and salmon roe. . Maine lobster appetizer - I've never had lobster that was so flavorful and soft. . Foie Gras - must have! Buttery and melts in your mouth!. . Beef Wellington - gotta go GR signature dish!. . Kobe Filet - a steak that is so so flavorful and so tender that no chewing required.. . toffee bread pudding and butter ice cream - the butter ice cream was extremely different and yummy.  I didn't care much about the bread pudding.. . Drinks - strawberry martini and side car. . Overall, our bill came out to be $360 and we feel money well spent!
I hate that I can't give Gordon Ramsey Steak 5 stars!  My wife and I planned our Vegas trip 6 months in advance and the number one thing I wanted to do was eat at one of Gordons restaurants,  especially GR Steak! A week before our trip went to make a reservation and all his restaurants stated they were booked solid for 8weeks! But what else would you expect, it's a GR restaurant, so I was disappointed.  We get Vegas and we're walking threw the Paris hotel and just to make sure we asked if they had any open reservations and to our surprise they had quite a few and made a reservation and we're beyond d excited!  We get to the restaurant which is amazing in and of its self.  We take our seats and I'm not sure if it's how they do things but it seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks and food, which we overlooked because we wanted to enjoy every minute. We order our food our first course arrives the British Ale Onion Soup, and it was amazing!  The best onion soup I've ever had, rich in flavor! I was sad after I ate it all because I didn't want the soup to end. For main courses my wife ordered the Roasted Chicken and I ordered the Beef Wellington, the roasted  chicken was beyond tender and juicy, the wild rice and crispy chicken skin complements the chicken very well. The beef Wellington was the best thing I've ever eaten! Definitely recommend it! You won't be disappointed. . . Now the reason I couldn't do 5 stars was because the service was decent, when your spending well over $100 a person you expect a certain level of service.  We ordered a side of Brussel spouts which didn't come out with the main course, we let our server know  and for about twenty minutes he would keep coming to the table and telling us there coming out but they never did. So we just cancelled them. And lastly at the end our meal after we had told our server we wouldn't be ordering dessert it literally took our server about 30mins to bring our check!  But the server assistant was phenomenal! Always kept our glasses full, checked in on us often but not to much, he was extremely professional, well mannered just an all around great guy! . . So in conclusion even though service was not what we expected the food more than made up for it!  Maybe just a bad day for our server, we all have them. But next time we are in Las Vegas we will definitely be going back to GR Steak!!
I wanted to hate it. Seriously, but the truth is that everything was unreasonably delicious.. . Here's what we ordered:. . Cocktails: BF ordered the Sidecar and I had the English Garden (loved both, but the English Garden was over-the-top delicious. Apps: We shared the Foie Gras with pumpkin waffles, and Hamachi Tuna (I believe), loved the tuna, but I wasn't overly fond of the foie gras. It wasn't bad or anything, it just didn't knock my socks off.. Dinner: My man had the rib-eye and I had the cap. The cap was perfect for me, not too big, succulent and juicy. Excellent.. Side: We only ordered one side, and we honestly didn't need more. Carrots with chicken skin. Excuse me, I didn't know I liked vegetables that much!. Drinks: I had a glass of rioja and the BF had two Innis and Gunn.. Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding. To. Die. For.. . Total tab: under $350 with tip. That is an excellent value and I would visit again in a heartbeat!. . Our waitress was excellent, cheerful, polite and attentive. Other staff were very helpful and made sure we were both pleased as pudding. . . The environment is a little loud, but nothing out of the ordinary for Vegas. Our little neck of the restaurant was filled with big Ramsay fans we excitedly jumped in to talk whenever we ordered something. It was a lot more casual than I expected, but that isn't a bad thing.. . We CAN'T wait to head back! YUMMERS!
Amazing amazing Vegas steakhouse experience. I went with some friends to celebrate a birthday and everyone from the moment we walked through the door provided incredible service. . . Since all of my companions are in the food service industry, staff could have been overly familiar and not provided the best experience but that was NOT the case. . . Food: scallop risotto was 2 bites of perfectly prepared heaven. Beef Wellington was exquisite. Hamachi had a nice twist. The 3 other cuts of beef were all on point. Side dishes were all unique and tasty. Desserts were to die for. Seriously, there wasn't one thing that I wouldn't want to eat again. . . The night got hazy because wine was plentiful but there's one thing I'm certain of: I'd be hard pressed to have another epic steakhouse experience like this one.
Honestly- I wasn't exactly impressed. My husband and I ate here over the weekend and I was somewhat disappointed. Presentation and service was nice.  The food was good. I've had better at a high end steakhouse. I don't mind paying $$$$ for food that I enjoy but $250 for just ok wasn't satisfying for me. But I guess I can say I ate there once
I've really been disappointed and burned in the past by a number of "Celebrity" Chef's.  Morimoto, Lagasse, Colicchio, Wong...  All perhaps too distracted by their next TV show or book deal to maintain the standards that brought them notoriety. . . This is so NOT the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris on the Vegas strip. . . From the moment that I was greeted and escorted inside via "the tube".  I had a feeling or perhaps sort of a cautious hope that good things were in store. . . Being a fan, I ordered the Hells Kitchen Tasting Menu which comes with a take home menu and autographed picture of Chef Ramsay in a little folder. Pretty neat and we haven't even ate yet. . . Bread was first to come out and the selection of four types of still warm bread gave the meal a huge head start (star-wise). Each was delicious. . . The from there the meal was a big crescendo. . *Scotch egg- perfectly cooked w yolk still soft. . *Scallop risotto- perfectly seared scallop on creamy, just right risotto. . *Roasted Beef Wellington-  My first Wellington!  And the high standard to which all others shall be held. Tender, moist, perfectly seasoned to accept the compliment of the demi-glace. (I believe that's the last time I use "perfect" in this review. . *Sticky Toffee Pudding- I'm not a big dessert guy but I've been having some stelar sweets this trip and the STP at GRS is ridiculously, plate-scrapingly good. Seeing it on TV, you can only imagine how good this is. . . Prime ingredients. Properly prepared and presented with caring and skill.  Served by by a staff that elevated a great dinner to a true dining experience. My server Donnie and the front of house staff did an awesome job. I truly felt welcome and at ease. . They really do a good job of taking the masterpieces created in the kitchen and presenting them beautifully. . . Props to the whole crew and congrats to Season 10 Hell's Kitchen winner Christina Wilson!
Have ALWAYS wanted to go to a G.R. restaurant!!. . The place is very nice, the service is excellent.... . Now I eat A lot of steaks and have been to MANY steakhouses.  I was really disappointed in the flavor of the steak.  Very surprised I must say...
We had the recommended flagship 5 course dinner which with a couple drinks pushed about $200+ per person. Although the food tasted pretty good, the overall atmosphere and meal as a whole just fell far short of my expectations.. . The courses are very small and take a while to prepare. The beet salad and mushroom risotto were very good but tiny. The main course was beef wellington which surprised me since it wasn't one if the better cuts of steak and is baked in a layer of pastry dough! I guess I just didn't realize what that was. For the cost and the name of the restaurant being "Steak", I figured a better non-breaded cut of meat would have been the flagship recommendation.. . The desert was also way to big a rich to even get through half of. For a Ramsey place I just expected more finish.
