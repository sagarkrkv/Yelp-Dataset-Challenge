We love this place and I wish we had one in San Diego...or maybe it is best that it is sooo far away.  Best left for occasional visits to Vegas, because it is THAT good.. . Plus there are plenty options for the Gluten Free society, which was a plus for my MIL.  . . The meat was all seasoned wonderfully, the space is large, customer service friendly and attentive.   Must do when in Vegas!
Oh how I love thee... Just thinking about my experience here makes my mouth water. I was very pleased with the quality of meat served in Texas de Brazil. For those who have not been to a Churrascaria before, servers make their way through the restaurant with meat on swords which they offer to customers if their cards on the table are turned green side up. There is also a salad bar that offers a variety of cheeses, olives, smoked salmon (my favorite!), asparagus (also a favorite!), bacon, salads, variety of Italian salami, sauteed mushrooms (yes please!), rice,  sushi, fresh mozzarella, au gratin potatoes and probably a bunch of other stuff I am not recalling. I would not advice filling up at the salad bar and may be grabbing an extra plate for your meats as they will start flowing to your table. . At the table you will get garlic mashed potatoes, cheese bread (yum!) and sweet plantains. AND THEN! As mentioned prior the meats will start flowing... The parmesan crusted chicken, bacon wrapped sirloin, garlic rubbed house sirloin were my favorite. The variety of meats is extensive and fluctuates between pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. . If you develop a need for a sweet satisfaction after your feast, there is always desert. The Brazilians cheesecake was delicious, Creme Brulee was.. eehh ok.. Your beverages are not included in the price so be prepared to pay extra and they serve pretty good cocktails. I'm pretty sure that the tip is split between the waitress and the carvers (don't quote me on that) so remember that when tipping.
Was very good busy inside but they still had good service. .i ate too much lots to chose from
Make sure you don't eat anything for the whole day before coming here! The salad bar is amazing with tons of items to choose from, and the meat... Wow! Every single one of them is delicious. My husband and I come here very often and the service is always great, super friendly staff. A+!
We think this is the best Brazilian all you can eat place.  The decor is dark and sumptuous.  The salad bar is stocked full of goodies.  There is always a giant wheel of carved cheese to savor.  The lobster bisque is divine.  The charcuterie is always good.  . . The meat the meat and more meat.  Tender is the filet mignon.  Try the beef ribs when they are done right - just melts in your mouth.  I don't like fruit in particular but I like them sweet banana things they give you.  . . The service is good.  The waiters trytheir best to deal with a huge crowd.  You can order what you want instead of waiting for the cowboys to come by with their offerings.  They don't always get it to you right away though.  . . The weak point is the dessert.  I wouldn't pay on top of your meal price for extra desserts.  They aren't that good.  Eat more bananas.  :). . I also subtracted a star because I think we got food poisoning there one time.  I suppose it is the risk one takes when food sits out and there are a lot of people around.  :(
Too pricey. No drink refills. Weird stuff in salad bar. Great tasting meat though. All you can eat too. Great variety.
Excellent food quality and quantity.  Loved this experience.   Only suggestion is a "smaller" lunch for a smaller price.  $30 per person for a lunch seems spendy.   It was worth $30, but I couldn't come close to eating $30 worth for lunch.  Overall great experience!
Amazing amazing amazing.   Food is so good.   Try the salmon at the salad bar.   Eat their silion steak.   Meat overload... Must shut downnnnnnn.
Some places my eyes are bigger than my appetite and I eat until I feel like the guy at theend of Monty Python's the meaning of life,. . Maitre d': Good evening sir and how are we today?. Mr. Creosote: Better.. Maitre d': Better?. Mr. Creosote: Better get a bucket. I'm gonna throw up.. . Good thing they didn't bring me the after dinner mint.. . I have been to a few of these Brazilian Churrascarias and usually find them to be overhyped.  Over the last 10 years, when I have been on a plane looking through Hemispheres or another airline's mag, there is always a Texas de Brazil ad jumping out at me and I say "I have to try that".  So finally I got to try it and I must say, for the most part, it was heaven on a plate.  . . Short explanation for those who ask "What the heck is a Churra whatica?"  It is like dimsum for Meat lovers.  Waiters roam the room with meat on skewers and ask if you want some or not.  Don't worry about the button that says green or red because they don't really pay attention to it.  The meat is rubbed with spices and barbecued making it juicy and flavorful.  . . First though, you get a small hot/cold salad bar which included some very good lobster bisque.  So good several people at my table including myself felt that we could just eat lobster bisque all night.  Butttttt, NO. We had to sample more.  Buffalo Mozzerela, Artichoke, sauteed hot and cold mushrooms, scalloped potatoes, salad, bread, cheese, salami, proscuitto, and more.  WARNING, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, no matter how yummy this stuff looks, do not, I repeat, DO NOT, fill up on the salad bar.  The best is still to come.. . Back at the table with an iced tea waiting, the waitress brought out little trays of garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas.  The mashed potatoes weren't bad but really, they are the last thing you should put on your plate as they will fill you up faster than a gas station attendant named Barry Allen (obscure comic book reference).  On the other hand, you will want to eat the bananas as they are sweet sticky confections almost desert quality.. . Finally, the first waiter with meat skewers nears the table.  Everyone falls into a hush wondering what our first taste is..... and it is sirloin, well seasoned and juicy, with rare, medium and well on separate skewers.  Before we knew it, our plates were filled with lamb chops, sausage, pork, beef ribs, flank steak, pork ribs, chicken, and bacon wrapped filet.. . All the meat was very properly cooked and juicy.  The ribs were a little fatty and the one i received was way over seasoned but the lamb chops were excellent, the filet of course good, and my favorite, the pork loin, one very overlooked cut of meat, IMHO, was excellent.   Don't be afraid to tell the waiter "no mas" or your plate will be piled to the roof.  The food does begin to taste the same with the seasoning but the flavor of the meat is never overwhelmed.. . BTW it is always the thin ones who eat the most and our group was no exception.  I was very controlled and did not have too much despite my eyes telling me to eat more.. . I did sample the bananas foster pie which was excellent.
It's a meat frenzy. I think I'm in heaven!  Texas de Brazil does it right and i've never walked away with an empty stomach.  Aside from a well stocked salad bar this place offers a great ambiance and service.  But you don't come here to eat a salad, you come for the meat and they bring plenty of it right to your table.  It's simple and not over seasoned which in my opinion makes it taste so great.  . . My suggestion, skip the lunch and save room for dinner at Texas de Brazil.  Your stomach will thank you.  It's Legen....wait for it... DARY!
On top of the excellent food,  the staff is amazing.   The manger walked over just to see how we were doing,  he was fantastic!   Great all around experience!
My favorite brazillian bbq anywhere - we try to hit this place up every time we're in Vegas.  The meat is always really good, but what sets this place apart from the rest (including Fogo de Chao) is the salad bar.  Other yelpers have said it already, but I'll reiterate - the lobster bisque is amazing.  They also have sushi, sauteed mushrooms, cheese, and some of the best cheese bread I've eaten.  And for the ladies - this place is full of attractive male waiters, unlike the rest of Vegas which pretty much caters only to your husbands/boyfriends.  It makes the phrase "Bring your meat over here!" mean something completely different if it's me or my wife saying it :-)  A must try in Sin City!
The lunch is fantastic, but requires RSVP also. They serve the same meats selection as dinner with the cheaper price! The salad bar offers fresh and flavorful green. My favorite meats are picanha, flank steak, beef ribs and filet mignon (which is little dry, but it is good). All the servers were friendly and attentive. It was a great time for me, and I would definitely come back for More!
If you are a meat eater, don't even bother to read the rest of my review or any of the other reviews.  Run, don't walk to this place and get more than your fifty bucks worth of lamb chops, and lamb shoulder, and sirloin, and ribs, and sausage, and strip steak, and ....you get the idea.   The meat was glorious (just avoid the well done cuts).   Minimize your time with the salad bar, and the mashed potatoes, and the plantain (or was it banana?).   Stick with the meat until you can't eat anymore.   Tell them I sent you.  Reservations recommended, go after 8:30 when the dinner rush is over.
It was alright.  It bothered me how loud the music was playing, it made the other people in the restaurant talk louder to hear them.  It bothered me that they have no table cloth and after a while blood is smeared all over.  It bothered me that the meat cutters would a lot of times by pass my "red" card and start carving me meat because Joey M. had a "green" card.  The meat itself was mediocre, it needed more seasonings.  It was fine as long as you have it medium rare, but medium was really dry and a little chewy.  The shrimp at the salad bar were the small shrimp, in fact the shrimp at Red Rock Buffet for $15 a person were bigger.  I'm just saying for $50 a person I expected more.  I expected Fogo de Chao so next time I will just go to Fogo instead.  I would rather go to Fogo on my birthday pay for the meal, then go to Texas de Brazil and eat for free.  The tap water tasted funky too.
We made a 6:30 reservation and weren't sat until 6:50, which isn't a big deal but we had $750.00 tickets to a show that started at 9 across town. Unfortunately because of this as soon as we were sat down we stuffed out faces with GREAT food. Ate way too quick and were over stuffed immediately.. . There bread is amazing, all the meat was great ( a little salty though). . Sides were all well prepared as well
You see, having a good server compliments your dining experience. We got lucky to have Leedke for our server. He is phenomenal. Granted that he gave me three servings of the banana with cinnamon since I'm a sucker for plantain. Anyway, the buffet of side dishes is superb. The meats were exceptional most especially the sirloin. My husband likes his meat rare, and rare he got. Only thing I can recommend for improvement is the level of saltiness of the meats. They're way salty (and I like my sodium).
Where do you go in vegas with a group of 12 hungry guys? TEXAS DE BRAZIL!!!!. . We arrived there on a Saturday afternoon about 1230.  Doors opened at 11am so figured there wouldn't be much of a crowd.  As i walked in, the placed seemed very upscale with table linens, glass goblets, fancy decor and hostess station.  I walk up to the hostess asking for a table of 12. She kinda looks at me in a strange way as if we were a bunch of ghetto asians.  I have to say we were dressed casual in jeans and tshirts but we did noticed some other customers were dressed in shorts and flip flops. She says we can not seat you until your whole party is here and i said, they are all here and showed her.  Then she says give me 15mins to prepare your table. In my head, why didn't you just says, your table will be ready in 15mins. SMH.. . After we got seated, the waiter was very friendly by asking if this was our first time eating here and if we know how this works. Everyone had the jest of how the process worked but the waiter still explained it.. . Started off with the Salad bar to get my veggies in my system and to get my metabolism going. Cant just dive into the meat and get super stuffed right away.  I have to say the presentation and freshness of all the foods was excellent and looked marvelous.  My favorite was the marinated shrimp and smoke salmon.  They did offer a lobster bisque as a soup but didn't want to get a bowl of it as i know its super rich and made with heavy cream.  Also it will take room in my stomach and less room for the meat. . . Now comes to the meat. We were served top round, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped with bacon, flank steak, chicken Parmesan drumlets, sausage, lamp chop, beer ribs, short ribs and pork ribs. Out of all those meats, i'd say the best was the top round because it was very tender, juicy and full of flavor.  The skin was grilled and had a small crunch to it which made it extra good.  As for the not so good one was the lamp chop since it still had the lamby taste.  I had lamb chops at other restaurants and it didn't give off that taste. . . Overall, If the hostess treated us better, i would definitely gave this place 5 stars, no doubt!!
