Been here 3 times and it's always a pleasure. This last visit was dinner on New Years Day so seating was tough but luckily,  I'm a Diamond Rewards member at Ceasar's so got it pretty fast so thanks to the kind hostess.  Kimberly,  who served us, was very friendly and accommodating.  She always check on us to see we got everything we need.  Was not that hungry so just had the slider burger with cheese and bacon which is cooked to perfection. The wife had the veal chops which is delicious so only bones was left.  Bill for 3 adults and kids was $211 after Total Rewards discount.  Will definitely come back.
They don't have ranch dressing and you better bloody well not ask for it! . . I guess this is the restaurant people go to when the line for the buffet is too long. . . It is over priced. ($9.00 for 7 green olives!) Kinda pretentious and mean. . . Thet mac and cheese wasn't bad.
Overpriced mediocre food. I really didn't enjoy the food and no matter what do no order the beet salad! By far the worst one I've had! So disappointed.....
Disappointing at best. Food cold. I sent mine back and they microwaved it I think. Unremarkable in every way except the overpricing. Boo.
My boyfriend and I dined here on December 27, lowering our expectations after reading some of the recent reviews. We were pleased with our overall experience. We arrived around 7pm, were seated immediately without reservations, and were well-monitored by relatively friendly staff. We both got the fish and chips with some drinks. There were four huge fillets of fish and plenty of chips (fries), and everything tasted great. No disappointments! We should have split the dish (and I wish our server had warned us of the portions but it was our responsibility to ask). The beer and my cocktail were good (I got the mocha martini) but both arrived at the end of the meal, which was annoying . However, our server apologized for the wait, explaining that the bar was backed up. I liked the decor of the place, the servers' and host/hostess's uniforms were really cool classic British punk themed.. . My only significant complaint is regarding the few tables behind the host/hostess counter. The table was very high compared to the low-resting chairs and made for an uncomfortable dining position. The table was also a bit wide and it was difficult to have a more intimate evening when we were seated so far apart and had to have a shouting match over the casino music.. . We may be back again but I want to check out Ramsay's other establishments.
I might go 3 but since this has Gordon's name on it ill make it 2. Frisee salad was underseasoned and bland. Mussels and clams showed up with a bunch of unopened ones. Service was a tad slow. Second time I've been underwhelmed by a ramsay restaurant. Pizza Antica in lafayette ca has better salad and mussels. . . Definitely not Hell's Kitchen craziness worthy.
Is there a zero star option? Because, that is my rating.  Extremely disappointed and offended. When I arrived at the Pub and Grill, I noticed that the establishment was extremely empty. I thought this was odd since it was New Years Eve and the strip was packed. the hostesses did offer an ala carte menu, as I was not interested in their main menu for the evening. The bar was open seating, so I decided to eat there since other establishments looked really busy.  My friend and I were hungry since we hadn't eaten in a while. At first the waitress seemed very friendly, and she offered us drinks. We ordered a pear ale, and it was very tasty. We didn't see the waitress for quite some time to order our meal. When she arrived, I ordered the sliders. When they arrived I was extremely disappointed. First of all, it took it seemed forever for the food to arrive. Secondly, the burgers were just buns and a burger no toppings. The buggers were the size of a quarter, they were extremely dry, and lacked taste. After visiting Gordon Ramsay's burgers we had very high expectations.  That establishment was phenomenal. Gordon Ramsay's burgers had a very friendly and helpful staff, and excellent, I repeat, excellent tasting food! The sliders that I received from the pub and grill were sub par. After I was finished with the disgusting sliders, I didn't see our waitress to receive our bill for more than 45 minutes. I even held my card up for at least a half an hour with no response. I would have spoken to the restaurant manager, however we were pressed for time for the firework show. I did write a note on the credit card receipt about how it did not compare to Gordon Ramsay burger, and that I was disappointed. To top it off, 20 percent gratuity was automatically charged to the bill. I did not feel that the waitress who neglected us deserved to receive 20 percent. I will not go back to this restaurant, and I will not recommend it to anyone I know. However, I highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay's burgers!!!
Worst service I have ever received in a restaurant!! If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be embarrassed to put my name on it. I was there on New Year's Eve and the restaurant was empty. Their dinner special was 100.00 per person. We asked if they had another option and were given their ala cart menu. My friend and I both ordered the sliders and a pear ale. We waited for a long time for our food to arrive. When it did I was shocked at how small portion was. The sliders were about the size of a half dollar coin and were nothing but bread and dried out burger. I only ate one because I was having a hard time swallowing the dried out mess. After receiving our food our waitress didn't come back. I then asked a busser for a to go box ( I would have just left the food but for those prices I was taking it with me), he didn't return. When we saw him again my friend reminded him I was waiting for a box. He apologized and brought me one. My friend held up her credit card for at least 30 minutes trying to get our waitress to bring our check. Finally when the busser brought my to go box we asked him to get our waitress to bring our check. We noticed that a couple who were seated about the time we got our food had still not had anyone approach their table and take their order by the time we finally got our check. When we received our check we found they had already tacked on a 20 percent gratuity. I guess they do that because they would never receive a tip otherwise. My recommendation.... Don't Go There!!!
Would have given it 4 stars as the food was good but service was not.  Started out good enough but halfway through our meal our waiter came to our table, shook both of our hands and then informed us he was going home because he was sick.  Wow!  Thank gosh we had hand sanitizer.  I then asked my next waiter if I could speak to the manager and he asked "why", that was odd....none of his business but I told him anyways.  Finally the manager came by and when I told him about our sick waiter shaking our hands he said "I know, he's been wanting to go home for over an hour".  So...the manager knew he was serving food and was sick.  we did get free desert but I'm surprised with Mr Ramsay's focus on service that he would have a staff this clueless working there.
I came here initially at the opening for a yelp event with my sister as her plus one.  It was memorable and the food was great.  I just returned since my first visit and unfortunately I can't give a rave review anymore. My sister's onion soup was delicious however at the bottom she found a little plastic surprise.  No good. Then our entrees came. She ordered the fish and chips.  The chips were stale,  not even warm. I had the Shepard' s pie.  Flavor was great however it wasn't heated all the way thru unfortunately.  I really wanted to like this place.  But between the very slow service and mediocre, overpriced food I will not return.  "Damn, such a shame" -Gordon Ramsay
*  Welcome Experience. -  Ordinary. . Nothing to note here.  . . *  Establishment. -  Outstanding. . Incredible!  It's Vegas!  BIG and LOUD like it should be!  Casino dining!. . *  Service. -  Discouraging. . The people were friendly enough but you had to flag one of them down to get anything done.  Busy?  Yes but is that any reason not to provide reasonable service?  No.. . *  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation. -  Encouraging. . The food here was INTERESTING and executed fairly well but was definitely not as good as I expected.  $28 for fish and chips?  That should be done VERY WELL not JUST OK.   . . *  What I'll remember. . -  The unique decor and ambiance is very cool.  . . *  What I can't wait to forget. . -  The intermittent service issues - AND the menu has DUAL pricing, less for those who have a total rewards card.  We gave the total rewards card with the payment.  They never applied it for the reduced rate.  We had to ask for them to give us the reduced pricing.  It took forever and was SHADY.... . They should have just APPLIED it without me having to call them on it.
Gordon Ramsey is a nice place to grab dinner with your coworkers and friends. On game nights it gets a little loud with the all the excitement!. . The food portions were perfect, and well presented
The only reason we came here is because we were watching a concert and wanted a resto close by. I would suggest skip the food and stick with the beer. The beer selection is really good but can't say the same for their food. Some of the items that were decent: frisee salad with mushrooms, duck rillettes, mac & cheese. Don't order their sliders, super dry, tasteless and nasty. If Chef Ramsay saw the sliders I got, he would toss it across the kitchen. Their service is pretty good, the server was super friendly. Overall, don't come here unless you want to drink a few beers before a concert.
Modern but relaxing pub that features elevated British pub food in a comfortable and lively setting showing sporting events from across the world.The centerpiece of the restaurant is a striking bar with an array of beer taps and a backdrop reminiscent of iconic British telephone booths.. . Went with a large group and we enjoyed every single dish we tried: deviled eggs, English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, a selection of sausages, fish and chips, pub burger, butternut squash soup, pork and duck rillettes, beef check sandwich and their roasted jidori chicken. All dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked - truly can't decide what we loved the best (although I have to admit, these were some of the best fish and chips and shepherds pie I've had to to date).. . It was also relatively affordable (although make sure you have the Caesar's rewards card to get the better pricing on the menu). Our waitress was attentive and courteous.  We will surely be going back.
It's sad to see anyone not have a great experience, as we did here on our most recent visit. We had reservations and were seated immediately. There was a line to check in. Thankfully, our table was ready.. . I love the modern old pub feel with images of London all around. Gosh, we ordered enough to share and seriously, everything was so good! I had he'd the pork chops with a chunky apple sauce- chops were cooked perfectly. Fish and chips we're not oily and had just the right crunch-the fries are just the way I like them crunchy in the outside and soft on the inside. Braised pork belly- oh yeah a winner. I can't even deep scribe the taste really just that I was so happy eating it. We also had the home made pretzels with the mustard dipping sauce. Great with beer! We shared the toffee pudding and I had to stop myself from finishing it had to share win other, plus I was so stuffed that I didn't want to roll out of there!. . The service was excellent and entertaining. I think the waiter knew what he was getting himself into when he first met our party. This was such a great time you can only go in and experience it yourself.  Definitely visiting again on my next trip to Vegas. Love the pups painting at the bar!!!
for a chefs restaurant it was incredibly disappointing. Horrible service-it took the food 45 minutes in an empty restaurant, and when we finally received our food it was mediocre at best. I won't make the mistake of thinking that a Gordon Ramsay restaurant will be good based on the name again.
Way overrated burger. Hard to believe when paying 21$. The service was good it's a shame the food didn't match.
Please note:  I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. I decided to check out his restaurants to see whether they meet the standards he professes. I think they exceed!. . 1. Sevice: This is the second of his restaurants I've visited. When I returned for a second go the waitstaff remembered me by name! :-)  They are all wonderfully entertaining and attentive gentlemen! I advocate eating at the bar.  They are talented, too! Describe the flavors you're craving and voila they will make or recommend something delicious.. . 2. Food: Need I even comment given my caveat? I have had the: Scotch egg, heirloom carrots, Queen Vic Curry crisps & the chocolate triffle.  . . The heirloom vegetables are amazing, savory and just the right texture.  No floppy, flaccid carrots here!. . The triffle is a snowballing surprise.  It is like consuming a chocolate cloud.  The tiny cookies served beside it hold multiple mysteries themselves.. . As you can see I did not try an entree. I must share that a side and appetizer or a side and a dessert are plenty filling.  Plus,  I'd already been to BurGR so I wanted to try things that were new to me.  . . 3. Ambiance: Fun and relaxed even on busy evenings. I don't think any sourpusses are allowed in here! Furthermore, I found myself seated beside Englishmen who were endorsing my selections.  . . Any future Las Vegas trips will include a visit here!
Just stopped in for drinks but those drinks were worth a review. I had the Pub Crawl. A ginger and bourbon concoction that was fantastic. Wife had the Blueberry Smash. Awesome and I don't generally even like blueberries. Our bartender Tom even gave us a free drink experiment using basil, ginger and lemon. Don't even remember the liquor base but it doesn't matter. I think we'll be returning this week for dinner because the fish and chips next to us looked and smelled amazing.
Started at the Charlie the bartender greeted us well he recommended three IPA beers that they had to serve I had a dogfish head I highly recommend having one shortly after the rest of my party arrived we sat and had lunch we started off with two appetizers the pretzel sticks were amazing and the deviled eggs was like something I have never tasted they were phenomenal! Lunch came out I had their fish and chips the fish was so soft great taste are server was very attentive great costumer service I will be back soon.
Very good. The waiter was very helpful and friendly, and the food was great. Our table had the fish and chips, shepherds pie, shrimp salad and their equivalent of french onion soup. Everyone tried everything and everyone was very pleased. Good drink selection. Would recommend coming here.
The service, food, and atmosphere was outstanding. I made a reservation the day before. We were seated promptly upon check in. I will definitely be back.
Great service and food was real delicious and came out pretty quick. Loved the vibe in the restaurant. I had the beef sliders. They were a little small in portion, but very tasty.
Four of us shared Braised Lamb Shank, our favorite, Braised Pork Belly, was fatty, Roasted Jidori Chicken, dry so dry, and Fish and Chips, same as most places, mushy peas were a hit.. . We asked our waiter what he recomended and he just said it's all good.  When asked specifics, he said the same thing.  He either hates the food or he hasn't tasted anything.
Stopped in for a quick drink with friends and we all ordered the same thing - the goodbye blue sky. It was a really delicious cocktail and I could of had at least 2 more!
This was a good experience.  This restaurant was somewhat empty at 8pm on a holiday weekend night, even though the restaurant was hosting an international rugby team and a chance to speak with them.. . I ordered the fish & chips, one of the starred items that was noted as a favorite.  It was very good but not excellent - I like the fish n chips by Elephant & Castle better.  The fish was small, the menu ala carte.  Lemon and malt vinegar had to be requested after the food was delivered.  Meh.. . The service rode the line of slow-attentive.  Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and we were left for long periods unattended.   I was sad that no pub burger was in sight on the menu.  We were not offered bread while we waited.
My husband and I made a quick stop here while we were walking through Caesar's, and I'm glad we did.  We were immediately taken care of by Ramon - super cool.  I ordered the pub spots.  The spots were tiny but were definitely packing flavor.  We can't wait to return to try something else!
Strip casino dining in its purest, most naked state of corporate cynicism. Enormous space packed with unsuspecting diners, a cautiously daring menu, an army of impersonal wait staff buzzing to and fro, European sports on surrounding flat screens--everything about this place feels like it was washed through a series of trend spotting gastro-bots. But at least you get to wait way too long for your food, and as a special feature it's all ridiculously over priced. A pint of bass will run you ten dollars. Ten. Dollars. For a pint. Of Bass. Let that sink in. Two of us ordered fish and chips and one went with hangar steak, all served with French fries. Thirty minutes later plates arrived with luke warm, flaccid fries and serviceable proteins. The fish is substantial yet flaky and comes with a tarragon tartar which is a nice touch, but the whole thing lacks any kind of contrast in flavor or texture. Hangar steak was cooked properly, end of story. Hardly deserving its thirty dollar price tag. The table shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which I have read much about. Moist cake, small scoop of generic vanilla ice cream, and standard warm toffee--enjoyable, but unexceptional. Overall, the "pub" fails miserably for how much it promises yet doesn't even attempt to deliver. More proof of the inherent evils of scaling ever upward. Everything about this place, the size, the insane prices, the vague service, the thoughtless dishes, exists merely to support its own fat, bloated fanny.
I really liked this place! I came because my husband had come with a friend during Nascar Weekend and raved about the lamb burger. The lamb burger I had was amazing! I also hadn't eaten any real food for about two days (We were there for a convention) so I got the carrots and brussel sprouts for a side and they were perfect and al dente and very flavorful! I can't wait to go again!
I have no idea how this place is only rated 3 out of 5 stars.  This place is amazing!!!  Although it was a while back when I went (Summer 2013), it was the best food I ever had in my life.  The braised beef or whatever I had was AMAZING.  I don't know if it was because of here, but I was on the toilet for the next 24 hours, but it was all worth it.  No joke it was amazing.  My friends salad may not have been the greatest, but the 3 course meal that I got was absolutely perfect.  Not to mention the waiter we had was a really nice guy.  He heard me and my friend were from Hawaii and how big of a fan I was of Gordan Ramsey, he hooked us up with a couple of cups, matches, and I even took the napkins cuz it was all Gordan Ramsey labeled.  This place was by far the greatest restaurant I've been too and I can't understand how it's not rated anything less than a perfect 5.  From the appetizer, meal, and desert...  It was to die for.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.  Better yet, open up in Hawaii please!!!
do not go here!  horrible staff!!!  we had the worst experiance at this restruant that i have ever had.  staff is extremely rude especially the girl who thinks she  is tuff pouring water. food took way to long, we had to leave without are food because we were going to miss are show.  are waiter hardly came by to update us on are food, we sat for an hour waiting on a chicken breast and fish & chips.  are waiter came by once and told us are food is being plated, 20 minutes passed and no food!  then he came by again and said the cooks want to make sure the chicken is cooked all the way.  sorry, chicken breast dont take an hour to cook.  the girl who was walking around pouring water said to us "there is nothing i can do".  shouldn't be in that line of work with that kind of attitude.  will never go close to this place again!  gordan ramsey should be ashamed to put his name on that place!  and, im typing in capital letters i want everyone to read this.
