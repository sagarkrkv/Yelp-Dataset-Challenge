Never will I book to stay at this hotel with my family again. The pictures online do not compare to the condition of the hotel is. The entire casino is NOT smoke free and the smoke just stays in place. No filtering system in place.. . Restaurants inside were okay, but most of the staff were not very customer friendly. If you are having an off day do not step into this hotel.
Never again. Disappointed. If you plan on going with children please be aware that the place is a heavy hot box. Rooms were decent.
This is an old family style hotel, which is evident in the lack of hotel room mini bar, which was given a circus theme.. . Our room: Although spacious, upon entering the first light switch was blown which meant you had to fumble through the room to find a working lamp. The bathroom also needs some serious attention as there are water stairs on the walls and the shower cannot fully be turned off, meaning you listen to dripping water all night. The lack of mini bar, fact there is no menu for room service or television channels was also a negative. . . The hotel: This is an older hotel so between the old and worn carpets alongside the serious spend required to update the whole building, this is not a place for lovers or high-rollers. This is a hotel for families. . . The hotel in general smells of stale cigarettes and while the staff checking in are tops... This has to be more about the hotel. . . All said, if you we coming to Vegas with a group of money minded friends to get hammered and visit another casino you should be fine. If you are working, go somewhere with good wifi and a clean shower. Not Circus Circus.
we had a good time with our nephew here who won a few stuffed animals for our baby. sure it's a zoo, or rather a circus, but i think it's just fine for what it is. just bring lots of hand sanitizer and avoid all the kiddie germs.. . big extra props to the worker who saw our stroller and puzzled looks and led us thru the back way over to the midway.
I cant believe! I came here with my friends.someone took a lot of our money. Around 1000$.I asked a security what wrong with a door,its locked last night and opened in the morning.he said he didnt know, he had to check everything and let we know if he know  something.oh my god.they dont have camera and we cant check .i never come back again.
Very bad hotel.  There is no ventilation in the rooms, everything is really old.  Also, it's in a bad part of Vegas. The whole experience has been terrible
Only reviewing the breakfast buffet.. . $15 per person, best deal on the strip. The food is decent, when you remember what you are paying and where you are paying. The made to order omelet station is outstanding, delicious and fresh, you can also substitute egg whites which I liked. They have EVERYTHING here. Eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, biscuits and gravy, country fried "steak", pancakes, waffles, "special" eggs, rice, beans, french toast...I could go on. It's huge and you won't go hungry. Being a little hungover going in it was the perfect way to satisfy my need to eat a lot of really bad food. They also have an assortment of pastries and fruits if you're interested. . . Side note: this place actually feels like a circus. There were SO many unsupervised children running around it was out of control. They are all crying and screaming and throwing food everywhere. It felt like a trashy Denny's. I don't think I would ever eat here again.
This is one of my favorite places to gamble in Vegas. I basically came to this casino as a kid and spent hours in the arcade. It is a great place for children to win toys and adults to gamble. There is also a free circus act show that is fun to watch up in the arcade. I would recommend signing up for the rewards membership if you are an adult!
Love it here. Food is decent. Arcade for kids and Free Circus Acts. All the service here is great.. . Good Place Overall . Only downside it is away from the nice parts of the Strip
Seriously,  the people that bring their children here should not be parents.  The place smells like cigarettes and urine,  everything is dingy, shady people all over...  Need I say more? . I walked around just to see if this place lived up to the reputation it has,  and honestly a place with an on-site trailer park and stores shilling 99 cent jewelry in glass display cases as high end merchandise really doesn't strike me as kid friendly.
Horrible. That is how I describe this place. Check-in SUCKS . 30 Guest standing in Line but 3 employees working. Employees no smile on there face as if are forced to work. I only stay at this place just because my 2 small kids.. Nothing good about this place. No microwave and refrigerator. Wifi free but very SLOW.
Ok, it gets three stars. Last year, two. What's changed? The smell of smoke is getting further and further away.. . We stayed in the West Tower. Avoid Manor court unless you're budget bound. In January, the pool is closed. Fuggetaboutit.. . There are small improvements. Food is just a bit better, like coffee. The shops aren't mindless tchotchke stores, although they get there.. . Then there are the time-share buzzards that troll the lobby, dressed like they were hotel staff. They chat you up like a Turkish rug salesperson, offering free tickets, but it's all about selling time-shares. These trolls seemed to be sanctioned by the hotel, which dropped the entire rating from a four to a three-star. . . Add in the Resort Fee, which ought to be illegal, and the price of Circus Circus gets less and less attractive. Maybe I should go back to a two-star. Nah. The rest of the staff was pretty helpful.
Stayed here on two different occasions. The first was in the West Tower. Clean & remodeled. The second was in the Casino Tower. One word: COCKROACH. It also smelled strongly of detergent and the carpet was worn and badly stained.. . I did like that there were shops and many places to dine at. Also, another plus was the large variety of slot machines.. . If you want to avoid all the children, go while school is in session. We last stayed here in early November and it was really mellow.
It's hard to rate a place like Circus Circus. Most only stay at this hotel for budget reasons, and even when most KNOW what they're getting themselves into, they still backpedal and complain. . . "You get what you pay for!" Remember that saying?. . You want to for a 'cheap' hotel? Well, you're going to get one. . . I chose to stay at Circus Circus for budgetary reasons, and It wasn't bad for the amount of money I paid. I booked through hotels.com and paid about $30/night for their newly renovated West Tower. The check-in lady gave us a room on the highest floor, and faced us towards the strip. I don't mind our hotel being at one end of the strip than the middle for what I was shelling out. Our room was clean, air conditioning was perfect, and our top-view was great. . . The reason I only gave this hotel 3 stars is because of the insane lack of ventilation in the hallway next to the casino room elevators(next to buffet). The smell is SO strong it's hard to miss.. . Some reviews state that this hotel is not good for kids even though it's marked for them. I hate to tell you this, but no matter where you go...this is vegas. Smoke, alcohol and half naked ladies will follow you no matter where you stay. . . On a budget? This is the hotel for you. Try to stay in the West Tower--nicer rooms.
We stayed here in 2012, unfortunately we had to go back home a day early but still had a lot of fun. We are going back this April, with our 2 boys. . Can anyone tell me if you can actually walk to Tacos el gordo from here? Is it to far? Thx we didn't get to check that out last time!!
Every time I Come To Vegas This Is My Go To Hotel. I Always Book The Skyrise Tower Which Is The Tower To The Right Of The Hotel...It Has Easy Access To The Pool And Has Its own Little Casino. The Rooms Have Been Renovated So They Are Clean and New...The Bathrooms Are Very Spacious As Well. The Only Downfall To This Hotel Is That Its Towards The End Of The Strip But I Dont Have A Problem Taking A Taxi Or Walking. The Prices Per Night Are Very Good Anytime Of The Year. I love That there Is No Deposit So I Dont Have To worry about There Being A Hold On My Card And The Resort Fee Isn't Ridiculous. They Have Great Customer Service As Well...And Of Course I Love Their Breakfast Buffet...Everything Is So Fresh!!  Ive Been Coming Here Since I Was A kid And Would Hang Out In The Adventure Dome Im An Adult Now And Still Like to Frequent Some Of The Rides! All In all Circus Circus Will Always Have My Business!
My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We needed an inexpensive room for the weekend. Checking in was easy, staff was quick and courteous. We were told we would be staying at the Manor. The benefit to staying there was our car was close for us to use. However, you are not attached to the casino. The room was older as was the furniture. The king size bed was very new and very comfy, as were the pillows. We had a keurig for am coffee (something our friends at a higher end hotel didn't have). . My huge complaint is that 1 1/2hours prior to checkout our water was shut off. ( no flushing the potty, hot water to shower, washing your face/brushing your teeth). Water was returned 10 mins before we left. . This was not my first time in Vegas but it was the first and last time I will stay here.
Smoke filled dump. Pass. Also the employees were the least friendly on the strip. Impossible to reccomend .
Do not book your room at the MANOR. It's literally across the street from the casino and is a much older type room. We booked our rooms here with a group of friends through expedia and thought we got a great deal , but NOPE! We ended up paying extra for the upgrade and stayed at the main tower. It was about $25 more per night. Rooms are smelly and old. I don't think I will get a room here again. The casino however is a great place for entertainment for both adults and kids upstairs !
