Hands down ... Best breakfast in Vegas ... This is the second time we came and we loved it. The food is fresh (salmon with egg Benedict), tasty (crepe) and delicious ... and the service is great. Even the home coffee is better than average.,,. . The location is great by the Strip so we could eat with the view of Bellagio, Paris (it's in Paris), etc.. . A must try when you're in Vegas !
One of my favorite places to eat on the strip! Being a local, you don't want to pay high prices and at Mon Ami Gabi you definitely get the bang for your buck. I am a steak and potatoes girl. Steak is phenomenal and although the entrees do not come with potatoes, the frites are equally as tasty. The sangria is a must try for everyone!. . Try to sit on the patio or in the back room to enjoy a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine!
Great atmospshere, food,  and people. Right in front of the bellagio. The food is very tasty and you can't beat the view.
we had eaten there for dinner but wanted to try it for breakfast.  All I can say is be sure to have the French Toast.  OMG, to die for.  I'm not a big eater but believe me I ate every single bite.  It was some wonderful bread with blueberries on top and a delicious blueberry syrup topped with real whipped cream.  My husband had his usual omelet which came with potatoes and toast.  He said it was one of the best he's had.  I looked over at the table next to us where the people had ordered quiche.  Normally they are slices, these were huge pies.  Next time that's what I'm having and there will be a next time.
Great service, great food and affordable price!! If you want to eat outside at the patio there's no reservations available, you'll have to wait for at least 30 mins depending how busy it is, but it is all worth it.you get a great viw of the Bellagio fountains while you have dinner!
One of the best places to go. Service is amazing, view is great and food is always yummy.  Been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout all my vegas visits. They never disappoint. The steak sandwich is great to share. The baked goat cheese with warm bread is always a hit. There's a Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Just a great place. Make sure to call ahead for patio seating. Heat lamps are on outside when it's chilly. Table by the window inside is perfect too. Enjoy!!!
After reading various reviews, I decided to take my friend here for breakfast.. Our waiter, #21, was very friendly and helpful.. Coffee was great. Food was delicious. . Patio seating a are first come first serve.
One star because there's no option of no star. This is a place that leaves a bad taste starting from the hostess. It was a nice 1/3 Friday noon that one thinks it must be nice to sit at a patio overlooking the Strip people traffic. There were at least 4 girls at the entrance (not sure if they all were hosts). Separate lines for patio versus inner sitting. When asked how long will wait be for patio "45 mins to an hour, sit inside no wait". OMG, rude! When I decided to sign up for patio, given a pager, "don't walk past the white bridge/stairs, and no outside coz no signal". Rude the second time. Finally it's my turn to be sitted. "Are all of you here yet? if not, you have to wait till all of you here" "My friend is not coming, just myself." Hostess face twitched. "Well, you'll have to wait for 1 person table" What is the difference between 1 or 2 person table. At that point, I decided to leave, no turn back.. . It's true that Vegas the Strip is famous travel destination, but customers are not chopped liver, especially having to pay insane double to triple prices for mediocre food one can find in other metro areas. I'm done with Vegas, not coming back in several years. Or will not dine at the Strip!
Excellent service and ambiance.  Breakfast was quick, fresh and delicious!
This place would get two stars if it wasn't for it's great location and view of the Bellagio Fountain. . . I was in town for a real estate seminar and my business partner, his wife, and I decided to dine here. . . Positives:. 1. Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip.. 2. If you're seated outside for dinner, you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.. 3. Dimly lit and romantic setting.. . Negatives:. 1. My iced tea was not refilled for 20-30 minutes. The staff is seemed so busy and the service wasn't that great.. 2. My medium rare steak was very thin and overcooked. I don't get how they can cook a very thin steak medium rare...I was expecting better tasting and thicker.. 3. It's very loud inside. . . Tips: Use Open Table and make reservations the day before or you'll wait 45+ minutes.
This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I am in Las Vegas, Nevada. Great for a date, family or friends. The filet mignon merlot steak is excellent. It melts in your mouth (Got mines done medium rare). Very tasty. For appetizer, the chicken liver patey is also an excellent choice.  I recommend that you use the baguette bread that you get as starter as it tastes better with it. The French onion soup is alright. You can't RSVP to sit outside in the patio area. This is first come, first serve. It has a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. You can however, RSVP for inside through Open Table.
This is a good, affordable French restaurant.  Food is probably 3 stars.  4 stars for the ability to eat on the patio.. . We ordered primarily side dishes and sat outside on their patio, watching people walk by on the strip and sort of seeing the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The french onion soup and ratatouille were solid.  Not the best in the world, but good.
Wonderful location for brunch, the Bloody Mary bar is a treat , quick and pleasant service.
Mon Ami Gabi was so good for lunch, we went back for breakfast. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time. You can't sit on the patio which is only first come first served, but we got a table just inside the patio so we had a similar view and I couldn't see it being worth the several hour wait others went through to sit on the patio. Getting seated immediately was much nicer.. . The service is a tad bit slow, but if you go knowing that, it won't bother you much. Plus, it's a restaurant attempting to recreate a Parisian dining experience, which is much slower than the meals we're used to as Americans. This restaurant works like a well-oiled machine and food was consistently great with interesting specials offered.. . The reason we chose this restaurant was because I can't eat gluten and this restaurant was rated as safe by people with Celiac disease so I trusted this restaurant to prepare me a good quality meal that wouldn't make me sick and they delivered twice. For lunch I had a burger on a gluten free bun which was delicious and cooked perfectly with Bleu cheese on top. The thin fries they serve were also great and we were assured everything was prepared in a separate section of the kitchen to avoid cross-contamination. The staff made me feel very safe eating there which is very rare. My meal even came with an allergy stick in it and the person that delivered it stated it was gluten free as well. Having all the staff on the same page and having these quality control pieces in place is the best way to cater to allergies in a restaurant. Also had the creme brulee which is well worth over-stuffing yourself.. . For breakfast I had gluten free French toast with a blueberry sauce and fresh whipped cream. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, even when I used to be able to eat normally. My bf had the skinny pancake (crepe) special with cinnamon and Nutella and hazelnuts. The waiter apologized for not being able to make gluten free crepes or waffles but that was fine with me and expected, although I would say it isn't hard to find a good waffle and crepe gluten free recipe if Mon Ami Gabi wanted to send their gluten free customers to heaven. . . All and all, great atmosphere, a relaxing meal, and outdid my expectations and I didn't get sick. Totally awesome. Merci, Gabi!
This review is just for the Bloody Mary bar that is offered on weekends. I love visiting Mon Ami Gabi when I visit Vegas, andI always  go for the weekend brunch.  The food at the Brunch is excellent, but the Bloody Mary bar has gone downhill over the past couple of years.  A couple of years ago there were plenty of condiments to use ... Pickled asparagus, good quality olives, and an assortment of condiments .  Now they have glasses full of things you can't even use, they are just for show.  This past weekend they did not even have horseradish !!!! Can you imagine a Bloody Mary bar without horseradish?  Hey, we are paying for a good Bloody Mary , if you can't afford to stock your condiments than either raise the price or get rid of it.  Shame on you Mon Ami Gabi... Who is the manager that came up with the brilliant idea on chincing  on the condiments ????
Yup, believe the hype and rating, this place is definitely worth trying.  Made a reservation and at 6pm they had seats available still on the patio where the view is definitely worth the wait if there was one.. . I went with the french onion soup which was pretty good, though would've preferred if it had a crispier crouton on top instead of something a little too mushy.  That was pretty much my only complaint with this place.. . For the main meal I had the steak bordelaise and I was very happy.  Huge portion, steak cooked nice and rare, great sauce, and the frites were very good.. . If you're in town and looking for a very reasonably priced dinner that will leave you full, this is definitely the spot.  I just wish we weren't in a rush to make our show time, otherwise I would've happily stayed for dessert.
Always a staple of our Las Vegastrips. A must for breakfast. Fresh whipped cream on our french toast. Sausage that is house made. Attentive staff, even if there are issues they are on top of things.
Breakfast AND Dinner are amazing! The staff is pretty wonderful too! A+
Excellent breakfast menu, they just need to hire more staff to have a better service.
After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for my birthday for lunch time. Both my husband and I think that the experience was very disappointing. First of all, the food was just ok. We got the steak frites, since we had better somewhere else, we think the food was just ok. We wouldn't call it good or great anyway. Besides, the service was not great. I think we unluckily got one that didn't do well (meanwhile I saw another server was very sincere with his customers, I wish he was our server). Restaurants need to know that the service from the servers could affect customers' dinning experience in a great extent. Our dining experience was negatively affected by our server. It totally wasn't a happy birthday meal. By the way. my husband noted that it was for my birthday on the reservation, so I don't understand why they didn't make it more pleasant for someone who is having her birthday.. We are not gonna go back even if someone wants to treat us there, why waste my time in an unpleasant restaurant?
A great option for brunch on the strip.. . I went here twice for brunch in the past couple weeks. A few tips:. .  - Make a reservation as it gets packed pretty quickly.  - Don't sit outside on the patio unless the weather is nice or you don't mind eating with your jacket on. The heat lamps are not very warm (we quickly got up and moved inside).  - The cafe area adjacent to the patio is probably the best area for brunch. Very light and sunny, but sheltered from the cold/wind..  - If you drive there, plan to arrive early as you have to walk all the way through the shopping area and casino to get to the restaurant.. . For brunch, I've had the brioche french toast and the corned beef hash. French toast wins hands down unless you want something savory. The smoked salmon platter is fairly generous and the benedicts all looked very good.. . Service was good and prompt. I had my coffee refilled several times without asking. Note they add gratuity for parties of 5 or more.
I been to Mon Ami Gabi before and their food is really good too and i want to come back its just i don't really go to the Strip much but once i go to the strip again i will come back and try new menu.
I've heard so much about this place so for this family trip to Vegas we decided to check it out.  We went for lunch instead of dinner because it was cheaper and it seemed more like a lunch place.. . ATMOSPHERE: We made reservations so luckily we got seated in the "greenhouse" area, where it's all open with glass so you get to see outside but it's covered/enclosed so you dont have the heat/cold or wind.  It was perfect! Very pretty/and bright.. . The inside looked kind of dark so I guess for a romantic dinner it would be nice but for a lunch the greenhouse area was perfect.. . FOOD: They give you a baguette in the beginning, which was very crunchy and soft on the inside and still warm when they handed it to us.  . . FRENCH TUNA MELT TARTINE - If you didn't know, a tartine is basically an open faced sandwich.  It tasted like it says - tuna melt, so you taste tuna salad with lots of different veggies and toppings on top of the crusty bread.  Bellpeppers, onions, artichokes...it was good.  It also came with a little salad on the side, which was nice.. . All of the hot sandwiches (which this is) come with french fries on the side.  They are very interesting and you can tell they make it there.  They are flat and thin, some are more crispy and some are more soggy but they were good and a nice addition to the sandwich.  . . SALMON SALAD - My sister got this and said it was good, it came with a good amount of salmon and the entire entree was definitely plenty for lunch portions.  My mom accidentally got the "mixed greens" which was a small plate and she added salmon to it, but my sister's salad looked much better.. . Overall - I'd suggest making reservations for lunch for a light but great lunch where you feel like you're in paris on the street at a cafe.
Have you been to Paris, France? If you haven't this is the best as it gets to eating in Paris, France. Eating here for the first time reminded my family and I of eating in Champs Elysees. Everything on the menu reminds you of France. My favorite dish, being the beef tartare. (raw beef). Although a bit different from the French Version. The French version the tartare is soaked in worsestershire sauce and an a raw egg on top, which you mix in later. Though the Las Vegas Version was quite edible. Needs more bread though for the tartare. The frites (fries) were quite good, although the frites in France were like big potato skins like thick and huge. The fish (skate) that my brother had ordered was pretty tasty. The one dish that caught our attention the most was the french onion soup. It was served just right. Since we weren't driving that day, it was perfect to drink some Frangria. (mixed wine with fruits). How much better can it get? It does get better, since we were sitting outside with a view of the fountains of bellagio. So, every 15 minutes, we had a fountain show of the bellagio! Sitting outside with such a view earned this rating the 2 stars. Try to arrive early, as it gets really busy! This is one for the books.
Love to eat here and watch the fountains.
Okay let's start by saying that this has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants after this first visit of mine!!!. . This is my 9th visit to Vegas in the past 2 years and have never been to mon ami gabi until now. I've always wanted to but just never had the chance to! And I cannot believe on what I was missing out on! Let's start by the staff being super friendly! And of course the location, dead center of the strip across the bellagio fountains in the Paris hotel! Cocktails were on point! My favorite was the Parisian Romance! Next we'rethe AMAZING appetizers! The escargot that was covered in garlic has to be my favorite! We also had the mussels and the duck which was just as yummy! I had the mushroom soup and it is the BEST! I can't forget the warm and toasty bread they serve you with butter and carrot musse! Then came the desserts...we had creme brulee and the white chocolate bread pudding which was so heavenly to the last bite! I look forward to coming back here again and again and will make sure I try everything on their menu! So glad to know that they have one in Chicago! Hopefully they are just as good as the one here in Vegas! Prices were very reasonable and worth it! Definitely will be back and hope you will enjoy it just as much as I do! Bon appetit!
Loved this place. Service exceeded expectations, food was delivered quick and hot with just the taste and flavor I was looking for.. Thank you!
We loved this rest to eat and watch bellagio fountain show at night time.. So romantic..everytime when we were in vegas, we stopped by this rest to eat and enjoy free show.
I really liked it. I had the steak sandwich. The rest of my partly liked their food in general. The bread was good too.
Based on so many other Yelp reviews of this lovely French place, I decided to have my dinner here on my final night in Vegas. Since my plans for the day concluded earlier than planned, I arrived at Mon Ami sooner as well and JUST managed to nab the one remaining patio table.. . What else is there to say beyond what has already been waxed lyrical about Mon Ami? Not much really. The service there was excellent, the food was top notch (French onion soup, ribeye steak frites done medium, a glass of Gigondas, finishing with creme brulee), and the view was fantastic. Loved every minute of my meal there, and I would strongly recommend Mon Ami to anyone considering a beautiful dining experience on the Strip.
Been here twice now: Once for dinner and once for brunch.. . Dinner was definitely good especially if you get to sit on the balcony overlooking the strip and the bellagio fountain. Food and service were excellent as well.. . Brunch though, by far was a much better experience. Sat out in the balcony as well but the food was amazing. The cornbeef hash my gf had was the best i've had.. . The wait was 30 min. which was to be expected on a Sunday around 11AM.. . Will come here again for brunch... and so should you.. . Good to take friends, family, coworkers, date, and customers.. Make sure to sit out on balcony and take sunglasses during the day.
I had the Filet Merlot, Medium-Rare paired with a glass of their Malbec. . . The restaurant had a great ambience, and the wait staff was able to handle the crowds effectively. I was surprised they were able to handle our party of approximately 20 people. Outstanding!. . The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the quality of steak. I have had greater filets in the heart of cattle country back home in Oklahoma. Overall, the restaurant was very good.
My go-to place for steak in Vegas.  Love their Fillet Mignon with merlot butter reduction.  Served perfectly cooked and oh-so-tender with each bite.  The pomme frites are consistently crisp every time!  If you go for brunch, their bloody marys are a must try.
Had the Brioche french toast and eggs Benedict.  First class and creative all the way and quite reasonable.  Well done.
best place for brunch!. . always make a reservation so you can be seated at the balcony. . . (good food with a nice view of the bellagio and its water fountain show=the best). . must try is. their french toast #1(never pass it),. i also like eggs benedict w/ smoke salmon.. creme brulee is love. my cousin like her quiche lorraine (its just too big for 1 person tho) . pair every thing with orange juice or mimosa maybe :). . a must go to place!
had the lobster bisque and the lobster roll which were both excellant.  I might return here, places to eat in Las Vegas are every where so one day ill return
Definitely a fan of Mon Ami Gabi. . . After an underwhelming  trip to a different French restaurant in Vegas about a month ago, I was psyched to get another chance to get my steak + frites fix and Mon Ami Gabi didn't disappoint.. . French onion soup - beyond delicious. Bone-in rib eye with Bearnaise - now THAT is what steak should taste like. It came out more medium rare than medium, which is fine by me. Perfectly seasoned and wonderfully flavorful. The sauce was rich and delicious as well.. . For sides we went with the garlic spinach, which was honestly just kind of "m'eh", but the pureed cauliflower was awesome.  . . No room for dessert, though I'm sure it would have been great. . . Definitely a place to hit up in Vegas - Mon Ami Gabi has great ambiance, service and really reasonable (by Vegas standards) prices. Winner.
There is another review which mentions reserving to get seated at the balcony. She must have meant the dining room, b/c Mon Ami Gabi does not take reservations for the balcony (it's first come, first served). All reservations go to the dining room.. . We made a reservation via OpenTable and was disappointed that they did not honor our request for a table against the wall (I hate sitting in the middle of the room), but the server overheard me grumbling and volunteered to move us without being asked.. . The food is fantastic. We love the escargot and their steaks are always super yummy. If you are seated in the balcony or any of the tables next to the windows, you get a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains. Very romantic. :). . This is our favorite restaurant on the strip due to its ambiance, affordable prices and location. We go back every time we are in LV!
This place is excellent. My friends and I were looking for a reasonably priced place for dinner and I am happy we stumbled upon this restaurant.. .  The ambiance is semi-romantic and because we came on a week day, there was no wait to be seated. All meals come with complimentary bread and butter. The portions were filling for one person, and the food was also delicious. I ordered a chicken and cauliflower mash dish, whereas my friend ordered the salmon and quinoa. The chicken was very tender and was not dry at all. The salmon quinoa was also very fresh. We both ordered an expresso for dessert and it was just what we needed before a night out.. . Would definitely come here again whenever I am in Vegas. (:
I came here for lunch during the holiday weekend and the wait was about thirty minutes. I wish I made a reservation for the balcony because it overlooks the beautiful, Bellagio fountains! . . They start you off with complimentary bread and it is really good, I'm surprised they didn't make me pay for it at all. (We asked for extras, two times.) I ordered the salmon with quinoa - beautiful! Cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. The frites here are amazing, I still can't forget how delicious they were! There were only a few left on the plate, and being rather greedy, I had to snatch them up to bring home. It was that good. The steak is also cooked beautifully and wonderfully flavored. . . The service here is really friendly and I was expecting them to be not as friendly (because it was Christmas day and most of the service I had encountered throughout the day at several other locations was rather unpleasent), so I was really surprised at how happy and patient all the servers were! Really professional! Only thing I wasn't so pleased was the time it took for my server to take our order, she came in about 20 minutes after we were seated! But the food came out rather quickly, so that's a plus.
Definitely a fan of this place! We picked this place due to the yelp reviews. The steak was great! I had the hangar steak and the hubby had the Steak diane. He loved mine more than his. I didn't really care for his, it was very tough and not much flavor. The ambiance of sitting out on the patio, watching the bellagio fountain was amazing. The wine selection was good. We enjoyed a very romantic night here. Make reservations. We waited around 2 hours for a table.
My favorite restaurant on the strip. Sitting on the patio you get a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and the smoked salmon is the best smoked salmon I have ever had!
Excellent food and service. We had the Waffles with Caramelized apples and the Steak and Frites. Both were very flavorful and would highly recommend them.
I love this place! Went here for my mom's birthday dinner with some of her friends who had been there before. I got the french onion soup which had to have been the best french onion soup of my life. For dinner, I had the entree sized scallops with brussel sprouts. I don't usually like brussel sprouts but this place happened to make them phenomenal. Overall, an excellent place. I'll definitely be going back. They also give you their recipes for certain things if you ask ;)
Easy to get a last minute reservation to this restaurant so we had dinner here on Saturday night.  I ordered the Filet Mignon - Merlot Butter & Red Wine Reduction.  Our entire table of 4 ordered that but our steak came out cold.  I would really prefer to have my steak nice and hot where I have to watch out burning myself with the plate.  The baguette that they serve to the table was very good.  Overall, an okay experience.  "Cheap" for Vegas standards.
If you ever get a chance to eat here, I suggest you try the croissants. Everything was super delicious! Even my mother, who is very picky towards non-Vietnamese food, wiped her plate clean. Everything was a pretty nice portion, the price is decent although if you let your stomach rule, the bill might end up quite high since everything is drool worthy just from the description (this is from experience, guys).
Amazing! Fresh bread and they keep it coming. Food was amazing. Waited for the seat outside and well worth the wait. Front row to the Belagio water show and watching all the weird people walking by. A must eat if your in the area, but have a little time to wait. You won't be disappointed.
Firstly, make a reservation at this place! Do not wait in line for over an hour like the majority of tourists who come to this place.. . As for seating, a table on the patio with a great view of the Bellagio is the way to go.. . The food is tasty, but the French steaks are too thin for my taste. After one steak, I considered ordering one or two more plates. The fries are also unique and definitely worth a try.. . During busy times, it is also apparent that the staff wants you to leave as soon as possible. Oh well, business is business.. . I am by no means a regular at this restaurant, but it is definitely wroth a try.
The view of the Bellagio is excelent. The food is good. A good option for lunch. To have dinner I would prefer other places.
Really great restaurant. A little pricey, but across from the Bellagio fountains and the food was amazing, so well worth it.
Yummy!!!!  I am in Vegas often and this is a staple restaurant for every visit. I prefer the dinner menu over lunch. Make sure you visit this restaurant.
Came here for a late lunch and got seated at the patio within 10 mins. You should always ask for the patio seating if the weather is nice because it is right across from the Bellagio fountain. Service was good and the food is not too expensive and pretty good! I would definitely come back again :)
We were a little tipsy after playing the penny machines and decided to spend our pennies on some steak at Mon Ami Gabi. Prices were reasonable and I enjoyed the ambiance as it felt really romantic and intimate. Our server went beyond and out of his way, when he discovered my bf grew up in Wisconsin and had the chef make a custom gravy with some cheese from Wisconsin. I had a steak with fries, and I have no complaints. It's always a great surprise when you are met with excellent customer service. I didn't notice anything about the dress code since the bf was wearing a hoodie, but overall great experience for dinner.
TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. Soft baguette wrapped in a paper bag and tasteless butter, oversized quiche and cold& dry fries, in spite of that the daily special lobster soup and cocktails were okay. Maybe it's because we missed the highly-rated brunch time so we got crappy lunch...
The perfect restaurant, I dined at the one in Chicago, and when my girlfriends and I wanted to go to dinner before seeing O! at the Bellagio, I suggested this as teh perfect place.  A nice restaurant, moderately priced, great service, and RIGHT across the street from the Bellagio.  It's awesome to have the fountains go off as you're dining, and the atmosphere & food is great. I would recommend to anyone!
We get a gift card for this restaurant every year for Christmas.....it's one of our favorites. Breakfast is awesome....steaks are divine!
Too much hype and too many reviews leads to lower in quality of food and service. It's a shame because I can tell that food can be so much better but the kitchen and service staff are probably in a rush to get food ready and turn tables. . . My steak was good but frites were cold. Appetizer came only one minute after ordering which leads me to think that there were a bunch made just ready to serve. . . Perhaps it was because I went during a busy time but if I do go back again, I'll make sure to go when it's not so busy.
it's a must go place
You gotta try this place when you come to Vegas. And you gotta make sure you reserve patio seating! If you're coming for dinner, make your reservations after 7pm, that way the Bellagio Fountains will go off every 15 minutes. It's so gorgeous and such a prime location on the strip. We ordered cocktails and the baked goat cheese-- everything was fabulous! Wonderful service as well.
The food and service is average but I have to give this restaurant 2 stars to compensate for all of the high ratings its gotten. I think this restaurant is so popular because of the great view.
Had a nice little meal here the first night of a conference I attended. I've been to the one in Chicago, and liked it, and there aren't any real complaints here, either.. . Started with the baked goat cheese and tomato sauce. It was tasty, but I'm a sucker for any type of goat cheese-based dish. My main course was the scallop dish, and while there were 5 scallops on my plate, they were paired with a few measly mushrooms and it just didn't go well together.. . The view was great, though - we sat instead by right by the windows facing the Bellagio. It was like dinner and a show.
Our last meal in Vegas and we came here. We sat on the patio (in January!) and had the best meal we've had in the 5 days we were here. Perfectly cooked filet mignon with Merlot butter and good little French "frites". Great gluten free menu, a gluten free bread and olive plate, and special allergy tags for food.
Try to reserve a table in the atrium, with a view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  Wonderful place for a casual brunch, the restaurant does a great job of transporting you away from the gaudiness and bustle of Vegas, even if for only an hour or two.  The brunch was delicious, a recommended morning stop in your Vegas culinary adventures.
A very nice place to go for lunch especially. The food here is very good and in the warmer month sitting outside on the Vegas Strip is quite an experience. Try the scallops! It's a bit pricy, but the location when you sit outside is very nice!
My Las Vegas trip is not complete until I come here at least once. My favorites are escargot, baked goat cheese, Frangria, seafood crepe and much more. Service is always excellent but for the one time when Gabriel who seemed like he wasmore into himself than anything, "took care of us." Other than that their servers are pleasant, attentive and down to earth. If I had a place to go in San Francisco that was this classy, affordable, approachable and comfortable, I'd be there at least once a week! Love u Mon Ami Gabi!
Came here on a Thursday afternoon, my party of two waited about 15 min for a patio seat. The patio seats are highly coveted since they are great for people watching, but terrible for sun burns and flies.  Located on the strip at Paris, across from the Bellagio fountains, this restaurant features a fancy decor inside/more lax on the patio, moderately priced items, and delicious food. . . -chicken and brie sandwich: with caramelized onions and green apple slices, came with their flat salty fries and a mini salad, this sandwich was very very good. Not heavy at all. The combination was divine. . -grilled cheese duck confit: also came with their flat salty fries, mini salad, a berry/ginger fruit compote. This was very heavy and greasy. The sweet compote is a must add to the salty duck. Overall good, but definitely share this dish as a whole sandwich would be too much, unless of course you plan on just lazying around for an hour or two after. . -free birthday dessert: puff roll with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream inside, drizzled with chocolate sauce. good. can't complain about free. . -marquis de la tour champagne: light, bubbly, fun. . . I'd come back for the breakfast and their french onion soup, just to see what all the fuss is about. Til next time.
Great steaks!  Great service!  Scott, our server, was perfect!  Make sure you are out on the patio so you can see the water show at the Bellagio while you eat!!
Wonderful staff, very attentive. Food was good- but the drinks-holy cow! Stronger than a mutha*+%#! Not that there's anything wrong with it! :) plus they cost a pretty penny so- I'm just saying watch yourself if your little like me, you'll leave out of there loaded!
My friend and I made this our first stop when coming to vegas last weekend. We arrived at 11pm, an hour after our reservation but hostess seated us outside right away. We loved the view of the bellagio fountains outside on the patio. . . We ordered light and went with the parsnip curry soup and the escargot. The soup was rich and very delicious, though small portion. The escargot was chewy, but equally as good with lots of garlic and butter. The leftover sauce from the escargot goes awesome with their fresh bread. . . Even if it's cold outside, they still have the heat lamps so you can still be comfortable and enjoy the people watching and fountains at night.
Food is AMAZING. Service is subpar. OK, we came in with 18 people, but just split the checks if we ask for that. Again, steaks were to die for, but our waitress was only OK.
Came to celebrate my 24th birthday dinner here and I was more than happy with the view, the service and the food. There was a bit of wait but that only allowed for a celebratory champagne toast at the bar. we were seated outside where you can watch the Bellagio water show as you dine. I didn't want it to end
We made a reservation... So trying to check in was frustrating because thy have three different hostess stands, and the hostesses were super rude. I finally find the right one and then I have to wait 20 mins for my reservation. When we finally are about to get seated the hostess offers us a able outside, then the hostess next to her tells her not to offer it to me (seriously). So she apologizes and says I can't have it. Ok?! A guy walks up right behind me with his buzzer and offers him the table outside. Did that just happen?! Oh wait, it did....Possibly the worst first impression of any restaurant I've been to. If my best friend wasn't so excite to eat here I for sure would have walked off.. . Lets get to the food. I ordered the special. It was medallions wrapped with bacon. And to be fair the waitress said you could not request how you like the steak due to bacon having to be cooked a certain temperature.... My medallions were so over cooked they were like hard little poker chips... And were as chewy a beef jerky. Possibly the worst steak I've ever had. They were a dark brown color the ENTIRE way through. Gross.. . The only good thing that happened during the entire meal was our server. #74. She was awesome! . . I considered ordering something other than steak, but since this place seems to be known for steaks I decided to go with it. And since I was ordering a steak I wanted one of the better cuts. If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a "reservation" for this place. Complete disappointment. Vegas has some amazing restaurants don't waste your time and money on this one.
Wow, what a great restaurant! The service was excellent. They heard my husband had to go on a conference call and escorted us to a quiet end of the restaurant. Our server was friendly and very attentive without being intrusive. I am gluten allergic and they had options and substitutions readily available. I had the turkey egg white omelette, which was very tasty, healthy, and filling. Hubby had delicious chicken sausage with hash browns and eggs AND the berry pancake, all of which he loved
steak sandwich /w au ju dip - thumbs up
Glad I wasn't in a hurry. Took about 75 min. To get our food. The table of 8 who gave there order got food their food 30min before us. We had great view patio seat, but something not right with how kitchen is run.
I always loved this bistro/restaurant.  Ever since it opened with at the Paris Hotel, I have been a regular diner.  When out-of-town friends come to LV, I always suggest a little repast at Mon Ami Gabi - on the Strip with the crowds below you - directly eating on the verranda outdoors area - what bliss...a great omelet is made there.  The one  thing I can say to anyone is always try the bread first - a good restaurant has good bread - and so MAG has it!  Enjoy their pommes frites if you are having a luncheon dish, too.  Viva la Mon Ami Gabi!
We went here for breakfast on our first morning in Vegas and loved the service, food, and location so much that we decided to come back for dinner for our anniversary later in the week! What a great decision!! We had the French onion soup, steaks, and a bottle of wine... Everything was FANTASTIC!!! Our server, Martin, was so great! He was knowledgeable, friendly, and timely! We let him (and his manager) know how great everything was and how much we appreciated the experience and they were so happy that they offered us a free dessert and comped our bottle of wine!! Not only was this whole dining experience above and beyond our expectations, we had asked to sit outside and they were able to accommodate that request in under 10 minutes, so we were able to enjoy the bellagio fountains the entire time!! We HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone - we can't wait to go back!!
Never disappointing. Patio seating is a must on nice days. Today we were told 15-30 minute wait but were seated within 10. . . Great view of the Bellagio fountain. Salmon eggs Benedict are amazing.
I usually do not go to French restaurants because they are over my budget but here the pricing was moderate. The food was excellent. We hard scallops which were very large and cooked to perfection. We also ordered  a cheaper cut of meat which was as tender as a higher cut. A balsamic reduction that was perfect.. Salad greens very fresh. The best part is I ordered wine by the glass and it was very good and reasonable ( $9). The waiter was very pleasant and the food come out quickly. The only down was after we where seated it took a while for our waiter to show up about 15 minutes but we did not mind we where seated outside and the water fountain show at the Bellaggio is excellent to watch ,we also were able to enjoy a street performer about 30 feet away on sidewalk.. Total bill for 4 was 175.00
Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #24 - #365. . If you want to experience French cuisine in a romantic or casual setting, than, "Mon Ami Gabi" is the perfect choice for you. This restaurant is located across from the Eiffel Tower ride in the casino and along the Vegas Strip where you can watch the Bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. Everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the French FOOD!. . I came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. Every time I dine at Mon Ami Gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. . . Some of the items I've ordered in Mon Ami Gabi:. . +Oysters  Du Jour - $15.95. +Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - $13.95. +Onion Soup Au Gratin - $9.95. +Caesar Salad - $11.95. +Filet Mignon - $35.95. +Au Poivre Burger - $13.95. . Everything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. If any of my friends of family were visiting Las Vegas for the first time, than Mon Ami Gabi would be on my, "Must Do List!" Especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. . . Tip: Book a table in advance!. . Bon Appetite!!
The food here was delicious! I went here with a large party for a bachelorette brunch. Service was good and prompt even though we had to wait for the rest of our party to arrive. Got the mushroom, chicken, and brie crepe as well as the mussels to share. The half portion of mussels was actually very large with a lot of mussels for only $11.95. Also sampled my friend's butternut squash quiche which was yummy as well. The french onion soup had a very strong onion flavor and was loaded with cheese on top so that is a good item to order if you like french onion soup. Their fries are good too - kind of flat but wavy. My other friends ordered the seafood crepe which looked great as well with large pieces of succulent shrimp. Other girls had the steak which is the same cut but comes covered with different sauces depending on what you feel like. Didn't get to try a bloody mary but they had this awesome bloody mary bar where you can deck out your drink with whatever you please!
This is a great spot to grab lunch with friends and enjoy some good food. There is nothing mind blowing about this place, however they have better than average steaks and seafoods along with with their sandwiches. It's casual-upscale dining if that makes sense.. . Recommendation: get their seafood platter as an appetizer. It worth the price.
I always walk by here and eating on the outside patio seemed so perfect.  The weather was perfect and sunny.  Anyway, the wait was a bit long and we decided to sit inside.  . . I was expecting good food, like really good food and probably small portions.  Anyway we ordered the French onion soup and the beef hash with poached eggs.. . The soup was too salty, we received 2 pieces of potatoes with the eggs, and the eggs were a little overcooked.  The hash was decent.  . . Honestly, the bread they gave us to go with the meal was the best-nutty soft with butter and fresh jam.. . I don't' really see what the hype was, but I still enjoyed my time here.
I had the most amazing meal at Mon Ami Gabi with my girlfriends! Our server (Louis or #67) was amazing and ever so accommodating. Imagine 4 girls with a million questions about the wines and menu?!?!? Most servers would get really impatient, but not Louis he took his time to answer our questions and make sure that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. . . I had the escargot as a starter and the hanger steak with the Macaroni gratin. Can I say that I am craving that meal again.. like right now. Writing this review is making my mouth salivate like no other! Every bite of that meal was to die for. Everything was prepared perfectly and not a step was missed.. . I highly recommend this place and I totally recommend sitting out on the patio to watch the water show at the Bellagio. Its atotal romantic place for you and your boo or a great place to have a fine dining experience with your girl girlfriends. . . Can't wait to visit Vegas again and try their other menu items!!!!
Steak Frites for under $30 that is better than the $60 steak I had at N9NE the night before.  And the Duck Confit.  Sooooo good.  . . This was the most unexpected meal I've ever had in Vegas.  It is now a regular stop for us when in Vegas.  We can enjoy a great meal but not have to drop $100 in order to do it.
This place is amazing! From the view of the water show at the Bellagio, to my absolute favorite, steak a la Fritz! Incredible service & staff!
Great atmosphere and delicious food. I enjoyed the melt in your mouth steak and the creme brulee dessert. I recommend sitting on the patio. It is worth the wait. Make reservations for best seating times. Friendly and responsive staff.
We went there on Tuesday afternoon around 1 and waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was no problem except the hostess walked us right past a great table set for two and gave us maybe the worst table on the patio. That's the only reason I'mdocking one star. . The food was amazing though. Mark, our server who was great, recommended the ahi tuna salad. It was absolutely delicious. The salad was very refreshing and the ahi tuna was perfect! My brother had the ahi tuna burger and practically inhaled it he liked it so much. Then for dessert he got the white chocolate bread pudding and he loved that, while I got the lemon-lime sorbet. . The service was great as well. Mark was very helpful and charming and we'll probably ask for him the next time we go. . All in all, great service, great food! Thanks mark!
I was pleasantly surprised by this French gem on the Vegas strip in Paris Paris. We arrived and only had to wait 10 minutes to be sat on their huge patio area. I could see why they had a specific wait list for this area. . . When we were sat I was disappointed that we had missed the brunch menu by 30 minutes. "NO WORRIES" says the server "I'll check with the kitchen to see what we can do." She came back with brunch menus and took our drinks orders. Ummm yes! Thank you! . . I ordered the flat ribeye and eggs dish with hash-browns. It was a good dish. Nothing amazing. Exactly as I expected. My boyfriend had the French toast with whip cream and blueberry compote. I had a bite and was totally jealous that I didn't get that! . . I would highly recommend anyone who goes to Vegas to check out Mon Ami. The service is on point and the patio is amazing to have brunch on!
Awesome and yummy! A little crowded and noisy. Wished we could've sat on the patio, but there are no resv for that....got lucky with that the first time we went. Would def go back.
I made reservations via Opentable a day later than I wanted to by mistake. I show up with my party of 4, and they managed to get us a table anyway within 20 minutes. Right outside of the door are some penny slots, so we killed some time and got a couple complimentary drinks while we waited.. . You'll definitely want to make reservations in advance, as this place is always packed with an hour wait during dinner times. Even on the weekdays. . . The ambiance (inside) is very relaxing, classy, and fit for both casual attire and dressing up. It's a great place to take your date. It's not too noisy, so carrying a conversation across the table is easy. . . The prices are reasonable for Vegas. I believe our party paid an average of $25 per entree. . . I'd definitely come back, but next time I want to sit outside to people watch on the strip and watch the Bellagio fountains in action!
one of my favorite restaurants.  I've been to the Vegas location 3 times and one in Maryland once...always fabulous!  I love the hanger steak, the french onion soup, and the frise salad.  So great to sit out on the patio and enjoy the night!
Loved the food...loved the service, but the view of the Bellagio is the best!!
Always outstanding! Worth it for a nice dinner out in Vegas.
I am a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi. I used to go the Chicago location quite often and miss it a lot. This was my first time trying the Vegas one and I LOVED it! Our server was actually French (Canadian) and had a lovely accent, which contributed to the positive experience. Although, I am disappointed that they couldn't do a Picon Beer. This is a beer & liquor combination that you find all over France. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about this place. Hands down, best patio in Vegas for dining. You get an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, which seem to go off every 15 min or so. The lights of the Paris Hotel & Casino are also a sight to be seen whether you are looking at their balloon sign or at the Eiffel Tower. . . The menu is moderately priced for anywhere, let alone, the Vegas Strip. I had the steak frites with Bearnaise sauce. So yummy! Yes, it's a thin piece of steak, but it's a large piece of steak and was perfectly cooked. I also tried the pate' as a starter. It was tasty, but not the best I've had. I love the fresh warm baguettes they bring to your table along with the complimentary carrot salad. The meal was such a wonderful experience, but the drinks were inconsistent. I had a side car that was almost all orange liquor and very sweet, but one of my friends ordered a couple of the same drink and they were both stronger and not as sweet. Not sure what was going on with that. . . The vibe is casual, but you can also dress up if you like. The patio is warm enough even on colder nights because of the heat lamps. The only thing that took me out of it, was the guys flicking those porn cards on the sidewalk in front of us. There were all kinds of shady characters hovering around, so ladies definitely don't leave your purses close to the railing. . . The decor was very French bistro and looked so similar to the Chicago location. It's just a lot bigger and not in a historic building. They even have the wine carts! I give this place four stars for the food and service. I didn't give them a perfect five because of the drink issues. Every nice restaurant should know how to make a classic drink like a side car, especially if I'm paying $12 or more for it. . . I will definitely return. The prices match my budget and I love the menu. Can't beat the view either! Gabi, you are definitely Mon Ami!
Shame on me for ordering such a mundane thing as a burger at this place.   But the gruyere cheese got my interest and I wanted their fries.  I specifically asked for a medium rare burger and what I got, of course, was a well done burger with literally a paper thin slice of cheese.  It was $13 and did come with their fantastic fries.  The burger was not made on the premises and was in fact pre-formed.  That's ridiculous.. . I waited at least 15 minutes for the replacement.  There was no offer to take it off the bill..I took it off the bill myself.  Horrible on-site floor managers.  They could care less about your dining experience.  I wrote to the corporate offices of Lettuce Entertain You.  They never wrote back.. . Beautiful looking restaurant.  Good luck and I hope you have a better dining experience than I had.  There are too many other more worthy places to eat IMHO.  Go to Spago where I have been many times over the years and NEVER had a bad meal there.
I've never really been a fan of french food, but this is hands down my favorite french restaurant. I make sure to come here every time I'm in Vegas.. . I've tried the beef wellington, skate wing, garlic spinach, bread pudding, lobster roll, cauliflower soup, seafood crepe, and french toast. The complimentary bread and butter are so good, I can eat it for days. I thoroughly enjoyed most of the things I tried besides the beef wellington, skate wing, and french toast. The beef wellington and skate wing didn't suit my taste. I'm not a fan of the texture of skate wing and discovered I hate capers after trying this dish. As for the french toast, I felt like it was missing something.. . Service is very friendly and nice. This place is great for a romantic date or for a casual brunch. I'll be coming back very soon :D. . P.S., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people. The bf and I almost died trying to finish it.
We had a wonderful dinner there last night ! My husband's bone in rib-eye was superb! And my blackened cod melted in your mouth. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas!
One of the most pleasant dining experiences I had in Vegas. It really does have a French feel, except here you get butter with your fresh baguette. You also get a small cachepot of fresh radish slaw. Magnifique! . . There is indoor and outdoor seating - the further indoor you go towards Paris casino, the darker it gets. I sat in the middle area - not outdoors on the strip and not indoors towards the cave-like setting. It was perfect!. . I split the half roasted chicken with pommes frites and a side salad. These are no ordinary French fries: thinly sliced and fried to perfection, they are highly addictive! Dinner for two (splitting a salad and main dish) without wine came to around $35 or so. Not bad for Vegas!. . Our waitress was pleasant enough, but not overly personable. That has been my experience with Vegas, it's such a touristy town that the customer service seems pretty impersonal but still gets the job done. Most likely the couple you serve tonight will not be around to come back again next month unlike establishments in your local 'hood.
Reallly good Steak Borderlaise, substituted the frites with mashed potatoes, really set the night! It was reallllyyy packed that night during CES, but the service was impeccable and friendly, and we say free fountain shows across at the Bellagio. One of the best steak I had during my trip, and even the creme brulee was the right amount of softness.. . Really recommended, and make reservations!
I have been told that this place is really good.  Even walking by, this place always seems packed with guests.  And after reading a bunch of the reviews, I thought going here was a must.. . Placed a reservation.  Reservations are for indoor seating, I believe.  If you want to sit outside, you have to actually go there and be put on a list and wait.. . I ordered the corned beef hash with mushrooms.  Absolutely delicious.  The poached egg may not be much, but it really added some flavor when you poke at the yolk.Hashbrowns?  Wow.  Not your typical diner hashbrowns.. . There was also a build your own Bloody Mary bar.  I thought that was pretty cool.
Professional job...can't complain... staff was pleasant...food was nice... view from outside was really enjoyable...winner.
Expensive but good. Boyfriend couldn't get enough of the coffee, said it was good and strong. I ordered the apple waffle and it was great, he ordered the lemon skinny pancakes (crepes) which he said were good. I tried the crepes and they were okay, but I'm not a crepe person.
This review is based off of one lunch experience, but they earned every one of those five stars.  Our server was exceptional.  Quick to help out with anything and anticipate needs, knowledgeable about the menu, able to answer any question and make recommendations, and friendly on top of all of that.  One member of our party requested a gluten free menu (they are not allergic, but generally just avoid gluten) and almost immediately after, we were brought gluten free bread as well as the normal table baguette, which was not asked for, but the desire was anticipated.  They were willing to allow us to have an extra join when that person arrived earlier than expected, and were more than happy to hurry his food to help us make a show.. . The food itself was delicious, the portion a great lunch size, not too big but enough to fill you and allow you to keep on going until dinner.  In our group we ordered a salad or two, a steak sandwich, and a variety of burgers.  Not one person had a complaint, and everyone walked away discussing how good their meal had been.
One of the best restaurants in Vegas for the price. Always reasonably priced and delicious. I always get the baked goat cheese for an appetizer. So good and the waiter brought us extra garlic bread for it. I ordered the seafood platter to share which came with a whole lobster, prawns, oysters, salmon, and a seaweed salad all for $50. Talk about a deal! We sat on the patio which was great because we were able to see the fountains at the Bellagio. It was also heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We were about to order dessert when we realized we were running late for a show. We had already ordered cappucinos so we asked our waiter if her could make them to-go. He put our drinks in to-go cups and brought us our checks very quickly. I always enjoy coming here for the great food, nice atmosphere, and reasonable prices.
We dined here on Thanksgiving for a romantic dinner. We sat outside under the heat lamps looking out toward the Bellagio fountains. Our server Jose was kind enough to offer to take our picture & provide us with what felt like special attention despite the crowd that night. Our steaks au poivre were done perfectly and Jose was helpful with suggestions for sides & desserts. Overall, we had excellent service with delicious food. We will return!
I want to give 5 stars alone for the restaurant being so accomodating when I tried booking a large party lunch reservation for my birthday weekend. Drew, their group event planner, was very helpful with the reservation process, willingly changing our reservation time and at the last minute, changing it from a large party (12 people) to only 4 people for lunch.. . However the food was ok for the price and ambiance. We were seated at a table next to another 2 top table literally inches away from us ("rubbing elbows" is an understatement." The servers were nice, attentive and well informed of the specials. I went with the lobster roll, which was stuffed with lobster but was too creamy for my taste (I favor traditional New England lobster rolls that highlight the lobster with basic butter.) My chips started out crispy but were bland and tough to chew by meals end. I liked the idea of my boyfriends open faced tuna melt sandwich, but preferred eating his fries which were crispy and seasoned well. My girlfriend got the seafood crepe, and she said the scallops were cooked to perfection, but very pricey ($19) for what you got. Her husband scarfed down his corned beef hash and eggs, but the portion was so small, he finished my lobster roll for me.. . I might have given another star if we were sat on the patio but it was a 45 minute wait! Overall, It wasn't bad but I would check out Bouchon for a bigger brunch menu next time.
Came here with a few friends as a "formal dinner night". An excuse to try a new place, an excuse to dress nice, and have a nice dinner with friends that came from out of town to visit. . . We had reservations made and were quickly seated soon after arrival. We had been taken to a table inside. but upon request, we were able to get a table by the window to have a nice view of the bellagio fountains and the outside. . . Service was really good, and the waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. With an introduction of the day's specials as well as recommendations, it helped on deciding what to order. . . For myself, i had ordered a Hor D'oeurves (id just call it an appetizer) and an Steak Frites (entree xD).. . Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - Oven-Roasted Snails in a garlic herb butter. VERY buttery and herb filled. Escargot tasted great and seasoned perfectly. The garlic herb butter was DELICIOUS and went extremely well with the complimentary bread that was served. Before i knew it, i was cleaning the escargot tray with the bread, not a drop of garlic herb butter was left ! mmm ! yummy ! . . Bearnaise Steak Frites w/ classic bearnaise sauce - Thin cut of steak with a mountain (not exagerating, there was a seemingly endless amount) of hand-cut fries. As for the steak, i had ordered medium rare. Come out a little more towards medium to medium well. Didn't really give it too much thought. The cut was quite thin. To get it seared on each side and edges, already puts it quite cooked. The bearnaise sauce was pretty good. Creamy, slighty sour, bright flavored sauce. Matched the steak pretty well. The hand cut fries were thinly cut and fried. Given a large amount. I dont think i finished it. . Overall, for the price of everything, the view, and the ambiance and experience. It was really good. With the weather allowing, it would be great to sit outside
On our last night in Vegas, on our 13-year-overdue honeymoon, my wife and I were taking one last stroll down the strip. We wandered into Paris Casino, feeling hungry and just looking for something different, so we tried this place. It was a very enjoyable experience. We ordered the cold seafood platter for two- lobster tails, oysters, shrimp and salmon, along with a glass of wine for each of us. The staff were very friendly despite our being obvious tourists, our server went on at length about the wine and she made sure we got just the right wine to go with our meal- she really knew her stuff! Service was very fast despite the place being packed, and the food was wonderful. The server was right on target with her wine suggestions, they were perfect with our seafood. The fresh bread and butter with the meal were a nice treat as well. They also found the perfect romantic spot for us to sit- a candle lit table for two indoors (it was rather chilly outside) with a clear view of the fountains of Bellagio across the street. Our quick stop to eat turned into a romantic candle-lit dinner, what a nice way to end our vacation. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 was because it was rather pricey- our food, one glass of wine each and the tip came to $90. But  funny enough, I had just won $90 playing blackjack in the Mirage so I guess it was meant to be!
My review is based solely on brunch. I would have to say, if I was to return, I would return for dinner, not brunch. IMO the food is way too heavy for morning or even mid-day. My hubby and I had the french onion soup as recommended by many reviewers on yelp. I found it too cheesy. . . and I am a person that likes cheese. My hubby got corn beef hash which he seemed pretty "meh" about. Not bad, not good. I ordered a tuna melt. It came open faced, with a thick slice of cheese melted on top. The tuna was mixed heavily with olives and olive juice. My first bite was so salty I could feel myface swelling up already. I decided to preserve both the sandwich and the fries for the homeless man sitting outside the restaurant. My appetite for food had vanished and I proceeded to order cocktails. Cocktails were good. Service was great. Ambiance is what gave my review two stars.
Very nice place...get ready to drop some cash tho.
This place is such an awesome dinner option on the strip. Really delicious French bistro food at a great price. View of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio, although they only accept reservations inside, if you get the right table you can still see the show.. . But the real show is the food. Steak frites, fresh fish, oysters on the half shell, delicious soups and a really great wine list with variety and affordable options. Love this place.
Everything was delish. Our waitress was number 71 aka Michelle. The food came out quickly despite the restaurant being very busy. Everything was cooked to perfection. There was sort of a clusterf*ck after we checked in  it seemed like there were a couple parties waiting to be seated. All in all I highly recommend this place.
The best little bistro on the strip.  Great views of the Bellagio fountain if you sit outside.  I say "if" because one trip it rained and we had to sit indoors.  Who knew that it rained in Vegas?. . Breakfast, Breakfast, Breakfast.  This is what you do here.  They have an amazing breakfast.  French-inspired.  Get the Eggs Benedict.  I go au naturale and get the style with the Canadian ham, but one trip they had it with smoked salmon.  I am not sure if this is a permanent item, but it was damn good.  Also, grab a Blood Mary.  . . Imagine snacking on perfectly poached eggs resting on top of grilled Canadian ham and piggy-backing on an English muffin.  Now imagine the Bellagio Fountains go off as you take a sip of your Bloody Mary.  . . Lunch and Dinner are great too and you will see more fountain action during this time, but it may be difficult to get a table outside.  Also, you will have to tolerate the transformers, batman, porn slappers, and other craziness on the strip.....because you are right there in the thick of it.. . I say you reserve this as a place for breakfast.  They deliver with taste and price.
Apparently the last time I ate here I gave up meat for Lent, well well well what do you know? I am now a vegetarian :). . There wasn't much vegetarian options but it could be my fault, since I didn't ask. I did see on their menu that they had Gluten-Free options. Pretty cool.. . I settled on ordering the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche. The cole slaw on the side was bit salty but I finished it. My quiche was a bit plain but I loved it & thought it was delicious. Nothing "food-coma" induced but juuuuuuust right :). . Service was good, as usual :). We always make a stop here whenever we are in LV, it's a must!
Great food and ambience! I love being able to sit right on the Strip and people watch while noshing on the most delicious ham and cheese crepe I've ever tried! The butternut squash quiche was pretty good, too, but the crepes are to-die-for!
Worth the wait to get the patio if you aren't in a rush as you get lunch/dinner and a show.  . . The food here is also very good and I'm a big fan of their bloody mary bar.  Meat stick?  Check!
This place was amazing, and much better than expected! The first day we ate here; we all had a nice beverage to get the morning going and sat near outside but not so near that we heard street noise or felt the cool air. . . Everyone loved their respected dishes. We ordered; Salmon Plate, Croissant Sandwich, Chicken/Brie/Apple Crepe, Blueberry French Toast, Eggs Benedict, Bacon, Breakfast Potato. . . Total for all of us was $140, which is not bad for 6 people plus drinks and tip. . . My friend and I returned the next morning and had a bagel with cream cheese and potato's - which again were fabulous. . . This is definitely my new breakfast spot!
Super surprised by the quality of steak at this place. We had a group of 10 for dinner. The waitress was calm and a damn good sport for taking care of us the way she did. Everyone was happy with their meals. $38 for a bottle of red wine in vegas that was pretty decent?! Major score.
