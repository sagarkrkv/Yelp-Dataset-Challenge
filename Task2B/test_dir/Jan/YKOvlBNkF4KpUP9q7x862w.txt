Great meal and atmosphere!  Had the chorizo porchetta and pumpkin bread pudding.  Salsa and table side guacamole were also really good.  All the food was beautifully presented and the service was excellent.  Only complaint would be that most of the seafood listed on the menu had been changed or wasn't available that evening and no one told us until we ordered it.  They should change that on the menu or have the server tell you before you order.
This was our "splurge" dinner while on vacation over the holidays.  We picked The Mission after visiting the sister restaurant (House Brasserie) on the Scottsdale food tour earlier in the week.  The restaurant is beautiful, but the seating is a bit tight.  We enjoyed talking to the couple seated next to us, however, if you're looking for a more private dining experience this might not be the place for you. . . We started with the guacamole, prepared table side.  It was okay but the salsa was actually much better.  Dinner choices include typical meat/seafood entree dishes or tacos (3 small tacos).  My husband had the Malbec braised short ribs.  It was a very generous portion of meat served on a very minimal portion of a vegetable.  The menu indicated they were "crispy potatoes" but they looked and tasted more like a plantain. The tacos I ordered came as described - three small steak tacos.   As a side dish we had a ridiculously large order of mixed regular and sweet potato fries with two dipping sauces.  We ate less than 1/3 of them, in part because there were just too many and also because they were not as tasty as the rest of the food.  . . I can't comment on the drinks, but the menu looked interesting.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Our water and ice tea glasses were filled constantly.  Because of the proximity of tables I could not help but overhear the party next to us and their constant questions and demands of our server.  She handled them all politely and as patiently as she possibly could.  . . Overall, I think this is a very solid choice and we would return to try some other dishes.  The service is outstanding
Pork shoulder tacos for two.  Street corn. Duck empanadas. Table side guac is good but not sure it's worth the 12$ as it's a small portion and hello-- so easy to do at home. . It's fun to make dinner into a tapas affair with a bunch for the table to share. Portions are small so the bill can get high quickly especially with drinks but it's a cozy and romantic ambiance. I love the fire outside on the patio and the banquette seating inside isn't too terrible either but for a truly special night I'd ask for a booth inside if you can't sit on the patio. I'm not sure how accommodating they are as I've never had any issues but it was a yummy dinner. . . Service was attentive but invisible which is kind of nice sometimes! No problems except fitting into my jeans the next morning!
After living in San Diego for 15 years, I will say that The Mission in Scottsdale has the best Mexican food I've had.  They have a roving guacamole cart...ORDER THE GUACAMOLE!  Someone will mix it up right in front of you, and it is so good that I did not stop eating it, even as the waitress was kindly going over the menu at our request...munch, munch, munch.. . Please also order the Malbec-braised short rib tacos.  They put one slice of dill pickle in, and coupled with amazing sauce and the meat, your tastebuds will be in absolute Heaven.  Provided you can stop eating the guacamole long enough to enjoy anything else.
The food and service was awesome! Short ribs were amazing and the presentation of the food was very classy.
Ok. On the advice of a few friends who have been living in Scottsdale for a little while, I decided to take the gf here for her Bday as Mexican is her fav. We're both from Manhattan and are used to getting damn good street tacos and decent Mexican food. So we come here dressed casual chic and apparently the hordes of locals, many of whom I suspect make 30K a year but acted like they make 1 million plus, were dressed in suits and such. Keep in mind, I am in investment banking and my gf is in fashion so when saw this, were were giggling inside. However, this apparently warranted sub-par service as the waitstaff was apparently ignorant and knows not what they do. No surprise here as Scottsdale and most of the area can be accurately described as trailer trash trying really hard to pretend they live in a real city and actually have real jobs. So what we do is what we always do when we try a "hot restaurant" for the first time, we order the one dish that a place like this should never screw up. We orderedtacos. The meat tasted like it was pulled from some frozen TV dinner box, smothered with way too much sauce and overly salted. We decided to end the night right then and there. It was an absolute disgrace. We have had much better tacos at holes in the walls on random streets in NYC. I still don't understand how this place gets such raves and high reviews. Maybe they've never tasted real, authentic Latin/Mexican food before and this is the only thing they have to benchmark against. Such a sad state of affairs, like so many things in AZ.
This was recommended to us as a fun evening.  So, we went for a girls night out and in celebration of a birthday.  Our reservation was made for 6:15pm on Friday night -- and it was swamped.  The hostess said she would get us seated within a couple of moments of our arrival, but instead, we were scooted around by another server asking us to wait in a dark lobby area.  We sat there for 20 minutes and no one came to seat us.  . . Eventually, we inquired as to our reservation and they agreed to seat us (fairly certain they simply forgot all about the 4 of us).  We were seated in the very loud, very crowded bar area and staff and customers continued to bump into our table and chairs the entire evening.  We really hated that.  . . As for the food -- top notch!  The guac was amazing -- we actually ordered more after finishing off the first serving -- but it never came.  Two of us had the steak tacos and raved about them, one of us had the squash tacos and thought they were ok, and I had the scallop tacos -- which were 66% awesome (one was over-cooked and tasted like sand) the other two were amazing!!!  . . Because we came for a bday -- we also had dessert -- bananas/pb & the churros.  Both were fantastic -- and we highly recommend indulging in dessert.  . . Overall, we might consider going back.  The atmosphere and staff were not the best -- but the food is really wonderful!
We just happened into this place early on New Year's Eve with our (well behaved) four-year-old while in town for a football game. We were not expecting to even be let in! Luckily, no one cringed and just let us know they'd squeeze us in if we thought we could be done by the next reservation at 7:30, which was no problem and completely understandable. Table side guacamole and pork shoulder tacos were amazing! Highly recommend and really nice people.
The best pazole in town! A beautiful and romantic-chic atmosphere, delish guacamole made at your table and a variety of beer, wine and tequila as well as mixed drinks to choose from. Me and my friends love going here!
I have been here a dozen times and have sent numerous clients here. This was the worst experience ever and when asked for a manager Brian Adams was very unhelpful. Last time I was here with client he was intoxicated. This will be the last visit and referral. If I could leave zero stars I would.
Every time I get the opportunity to eat at place that can remind me of my madreland I'm always a sucker to try it.  Most times I'm not impressed because... See review for all the other Mexican places I have ventured but other times it's a great experience and treat. . . Meantime I decided to go out with my team and we looked forward to this awesome atmosphere and restaurant located in old town Snobsdale. We made reservations and ended up with Lauren our server for the night.  We ordered appetizers like the Guacamole and the cheese plate.  The guacamole was good but nothing beyond what other local joints can do and I was not impressed with the portion which was very small. The cheese plate was not my favorite.. . We kept getting pushed to hurry and order and we were still having cocktails and waiting for another member. The server said if there was any chance we can call our friend to order her food because they needed to serve more guest?? What the French! Did we just get checked at a high end restaurant and were told to hurry up?! . . By the time we got our food I was really annoyed.  Here I am bringing out my team and although I understand you have a busy place, get over yourself and make sure your hostess doesn't seat us if we don't have a party versus making such a classless move.  Foul!. . The food was okay but my experience just bummed me out.  I talked to the manager, Brian and he said it was a tough balance and hoped we can understand.  We will see whether I would ever do this again.  It's not like I do this every once in a while, I'm out and about all the time.  Boo
4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because it's a good day :)...here's what we grubbed on @ El Mission:. *Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze- get it! My favorite thing on the menu. *Grilled street corn: bueno, but not quite as good as the street grilled variety in Mexico . *Lamb rib appetizer- fatty and not too much meat...but the good bits we're awesome!. *Mahi Mahi tacos- decent, but save the fish tacos for another time and place!. *Espresso churros & milkshake- a tasty and fun dessert...couldn't taste the espresso, but it was fun to dip those crunchy morsels!. . Our server was also very knowledgeable - will definitely be returning to the Mission!
Great food and drinks! I also love the atmosphere...not always the best service, but worth it for the food and surroundings.
Definitely try the guacamole, crispy pork belly, and the margaritas! They make the guacomole right in front of your yable! So delish!
No matter how good the food is, how you treat your customers is what really distinguishes a great restaurant.  Tonight we came in to dine and were told all they had was outside seating.  This was not told to us beforehand, and if we had known we would have come another evening, as we don't care for outside seating.  Instead of accommodating us, we were left to take it or leave it.  So we left.  We know the food is very good, as we've been to the restaurant many times before--we live in the area, as opposed to the many patrons who are visitors.  So, MIssion, when the economy tanks again or it's summer and you need the local residents to help you make it, good luck.  Not to say we won't be going there again, but we certainly won't be recommending you to our friends and visitors.  And by the way, Los Sombreros was thrilled to welcome us back and the food is just as good, if not better!
We had a reservation at 8 for a group of 7. We showed up a little before 8 and they told us they were just getting out table ready and asked if we could wait. Literally 5 minutes later, a waiter brings by free mini sized margaritas as a thank you for being patient. Already in an awesome mood.. . The drink menu is extensive, and just about everything is great (I would know because we all swapped drinks and tried each others).. . Food: you must get the guacamole as a started. But caveat, do not overeat chips or you will be full by the time your entree arrives! I ordered the butternut squash tacos, which were so good. Everyone else got steak or fish and also loved their dish.. . Great ambiance, great service, nothing but raves about the food and drinks.
You've got to get the guacamole & pork shoulder!  Cool atmosphere and great food...we loved this place! Service could've been a bit quicker but the quality of the food made up for it.
We came for brunch on Sunday and being it was our first time we made reservations. They were probably not needed at 11am, but it did get a little busier as morning turned to afternoon. We asked to be seated on the patio and the hostess seemed somewhat confused. When she took us outside she tried to seat us right next to the only other table on the patio. We said we would prefer to sit on the other, empty side. The next couple that came in was seated right next to us!. . The menu looked good, but the brunch section only had about 5 items, not much of a choice. The server was friendly and recommended the huevos rancheros, she asked if we wanted meat, my girlfriend said no as she is a vegetarian. When it came it had pork, but the food runner was quick to correct it.. . I asked for her recommendation between the red or green chilaquilles and she wholeheartedly said green. Seeing that the green had cilantro and the red didn't , I went green - they were good, but the green was chicken and the red was pork and everyone raves about the pork here, maybe I should have got the red.. . The talk of the town here is "try the guacamole" and while it wasn't bad, making it tableside wasn't much of a show and one avocado certainly wasn't worth $12. The awkwardness started when the guacamole was finished and plopped on the table, but the chips didn't arrive until a good 5 minutes later. Wasn't sure if I should be eating it with a spoon or not.. . Mimosas and bloody marys were half off, which was nice, but when I ordered a second one it didn't arrive until well after I was finished eating and then only after a reminder.. . Maybe it was because we came so soon after they opened and maybe everyone was still hungover from Saturday night, but the hostess, server and cook just weren't on their A game today.
Lovely place, this is where we like to take out of town guests for local cuisine. Excellent drinks & ambiance, make a reservation in advance weekends are very busy!
Horrible horrible experience. We went to this restaurant specifically due to their allergy friendly menu options and rating. We announced the food allergy and she very clearly understood it when we ordered but the waitress ignored the food allergy, served us food that made one member of our party exceedingly sick, spent the night in the hospital and ruined the entire next day, our only full day in Phoenix! The manager was very nice in person but asked me to follow-up then never returned a call. I just made call number FOUR and neither Bryan Adams nor partial owner Brian Raab have responded! So disappointed. To boot, they billed us for the dinner! HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE.  Lastly, we had reserved a 845 table, were told when we arrived it wouldn't be until 915pm but then they magically got us in 2 minutes after we had drinks in hand from the bar.
Favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for groups and dates. I had my birthday brunch their this year with my twin sister and they accommodated us great for a large group of 20. Sunday brunch buffet is the best for the pork tacos, all you can eat for $16. The ghost sauce is amazing but use with caution. Also ask for the baby taster frozen margaritas of the day. Then order them mixed if you like both of them. Best margaritas in town. Be bold don't go with a skinny one here. They are worth the extra calories. Table side guacamole is MUST HAVE!. . ENJOY!
