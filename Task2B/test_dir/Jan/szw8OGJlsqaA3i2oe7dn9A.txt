I am here only for their desserts. I am not a dessert person but am definitely impressed by its cute decorations! After passing by it one time, I decided to give it a try. I ordered a scoop of coconut gelato and love it very much. I want to go back and try other flavors of gelato and cakes next time I visit Vegas!
When I walk pass by.... WOW! Beautiful cake decoration! I can't resist to stop & check out the store... and of course take lots of pictures!!. . Checking out the prices for the merchandise they are selling... kind of pricey. Maybe because it is the pastry shop in the hotel.
I just had the blueberry cupcake.. Omg.. Divine! I was scared that it would taste fake crappy because of the bright color on top, but it's not fake tasting at all. When you dig a spoon in, there are layers of different kinds of mousses and creams. . I will post pics
This was my first time trying gelato, and I am a fan. Jean Philippe has other assortments of treats and goodies ranging from drinks to cakes. Their display of these goodies will make your mouth water.. . The prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, but I guess it's because it's right in the middle of everything (casinos, sites, shopping). My one scoop of tiramisu cost about $3.75 + tax. It's not at all outrageous, but it could have been a tad cheaper. I don't recommend getting the tiramisu. The caramel brulee tasted pretty good as I stole a sample from my friends. If you are unsure about what to get, you can get samples and test out the flavors yourself. . . This is one of two locations in the area. I believe the other location has a chocolate fountain because I did pass it along the way. I would say give this place a go, but Iam sure there are other places selling gelato for a lot cheaper.
Best pastries ever! They are almost too pretty to eat!
I passed the JP Patisserie in the Bellagio one evening, but after seeing the huge line I decided against it (there were crowds around the chocolate fountain, which is very cool to see in person). Tried the ARIA location, the line is just as big, even at 10am! My boyfriend and I came to try to some breakfast...and couldn't pass up dessert while we were at it. We got a couple sandwiches, some coffee (chai tea latte for me) and a couple desserts. I tried the Trio and he got the red velvet cupcake.. . Although it was a bit of a wait, it was worth it. Everything from the drinks to the desserts were on point. It was a challenge to find a place to sit, but a couple ladies saw us waiting and got right up since they were just lounging.. . The sandwich I got was the Turkey panini. It was juicy and the bread had a great crunch. All the ingredients were very fresh (the tomato was extremely juicy). I'm not a big fan of mayo but they mayo they used was delicious. Whole sandwich gone in less than 3 minutes.. . The best part, of course, was dessert. The trio featured a rose and raspberry macaron, Snickers cake pop, and a creme brulee, all on a chocolate base. The cake pop was the most surprising as usually cake pops are a dry mess, but this tasted exactly like a Snickers ice cream bar! My absolute favorite, though, was the rose macaron. Best macaron I've ever had. I wish I had gotten the large macaron instead of the trio! The red velvet cupcake was different, butextraordinary. Every layer was rich and flavorful. . . Everything in this place looks delicious, I wish I could've tried it all!! It can get expensive once you start adding things up, but everything is worth the price it was given.
My ham and cheese croissant was extremely soggy with no body or texture was completely messy. I can get a better croissant at a hole-in-the-wall donut shop for $2.
Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #23 - #365. . If you're looking for that Vegas experience with seductive desserts, than I suggest you go to Jean Philippe Patisserie inside the Aria casino. I was craving for some dessert and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg on the strip for some sweets. So, I went on to MyVegas page and bought a Crepe coupon for 10,000 points and I ended up saving myself $10! . . How sweet was that!. . Very very tasty and it just melted in my mouth. I ordered the Chocolate Crepe with Raspberry sorbet and added some fresh strawberries.Mmm Goodness, I was in Crepe heaven, it filled me up to the point where I had to skip dinner. . . Next time I'm at Jean Philippe, I'll try those savory pastries and some sorbet while I'm at it by using MyVegas points to comp my meal.
Tried many things at this Patisserie when I was staying at the Aria hotel in Vegas recently.  The coffee, tea, and orange juice are good, as is the dulce de leche gelato.  The pastries are very rich and filling.  The tiramisu is not the best but it is good.  The cheese danish is big and tasty.  As for the salads, the Asian salad is good (comes with shrimp, not chicken and it is prepackaged).  The wrap sandwiches are pretty good as well.  The only thing is the line can get crowded with people merely wanting to take pictures of the pastries.  The prices are on the high end definitely, but for Vegas that is to be expected.  I would definitely come back here again next time I'm at the Aria hotel and I want to try the crepes.
Desserts are amazing! I had the pistachio gelato and tried one of the cheese cakes. Not only do they taste divine, they look great. The service was great and there was not a long wait. Everyone was friendly. . . You can also order cakes there for different events. You do have to give them 24 hour notice though.
This place is amazing.  Fantastic crepes, and an eye dropping dessert line up.  Great quality!  It is on the pricey side for the amount, but it doesn't disappoint in taste.
Every time we go to Vegas, we HAVE to stop by to get desserts from here. Everything we've gotten has been fantastic! My family and I are the toughest critics when it comes to desserts, so trust me when I say this place is amazing. You won't find quality like this at your local bakery.
Amazing desserts! Beautiful and delicious. So many options -- it took me a while to decide what I wanted. Thankfully, there was no line when we stopped by in the mid-afternoon. Most of the cakes and desserts are in the $7 - $9 range, which seems reasonable to me considering the quality and presentation. . . I treated myself to the Sweet Trio, one of the larger desserts, as I assumed that my husband would want to share it with me. (Turns out he didn't want any dessert, so it was all mine!) The Sweet Trio comes with vanilla creme brulee, a raspberry macaron, and a caramel peanut cakepop. It's served up on a little tray that's made of chocolate. Everything was delicious and perfect with a glass of sparkling wine. . . Jean Philippe Patisserie is a must try when you're in Vegas!
Where do I start? Jean Philippe does not mess around. Everything is good. When you order it always feels like you are going through an amazing buffet and want to have one of everything. It's not a buffet though, so you will have to pay for each item, so be careful. This place is expensive, but it's really worth it. All of the food is high quality, fresh, and delicious. . . Some of my favorite items:. -The turkey croissant sandwich. -The paninis (all of them). -The quiche with asparagus . . Dessert. -The chocolate eclair is hands down the best one I've ever had. -The strawberry tart. . Chocolate:. -All of the chocolate is good. . Nougat:. -They are all good. Recently got some raspberry and pistachio . . Crepe:. -I have only had the sweet ones and they are great. I need to try the savory ones next time. . Drinks:. -Mocha and hot chocolate are awesome. -Orange juice (so fresh). . You really can't go wrong with this place. If you are in Vegas, then you have to stop here.
Jean Philippe, you are a genius! Wish I was there when they had the chocolate dragon for the year of the dragon. . . I stayed at Aria recently and walked by this patisserie as I was going up to my room. Decided to pick up a few items for lunch. We came here three times during our stay. The first time we had the cobb salad, which was very good. Second time was chicken pesto sandwich, croissant sandwich, raspberry rose macaron and fruit tart. The last time we had a chicken pesto crepe from the crepe station. I am a sugar fiend, so I will get dessert pretty much every time I eat out. I would say that the raspberry rose macaron and fruit tart, while beautifully arranged and presented, are not worth getting. The flavors did not leave a lasting impression. The crust to the fruit tart was too thick. On the other hand, the savory items, especially the chicken pesto sandwich and crepe (if you like pesto) are a must try. . . It is quite pricey, but I definitely recommend trying this place out if you are in Vegas. I also love how they open late (:
Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria has such a beautiful presentation of deserts and gift items.. but what I ended up having was the Apple Sensation Crepe.. a long wait but worth it! It was one of my MyVegas facebook game rewards so it was a nice treat.. tasted great.. The service is very professional and efficient.. I tried the Berry Crepe on another visit and it was excellent also.. Only issue is it can get cramped here it is hard to find a seat... . If staying at Vdara, Aria is about a 3 min walk and Jean Phillippe is conveniently located at the Aria entrance closest to Vdara.... Looking forward to trying a beautiful desert here next time!
Jean Philippe is absolutely superb. The food is of the highest quality and the flavors are complex, varied, and most importantly delicious.. . I've only ever had desserts at Jean Philippe but I would have to say that's what you should be getting when you go there. I've tried some of their chocolates which are very good, and a friend once had their creme brulee which he said was top notch as well and cooked well.. . But my favorite thing at Jean Philippe has to be their gelatos/ice creams. They are some of the absolute best ice creams I've ever had as they are just so full of flavor that lingers just long enough in your mouth for you to truly savor the wonder. My friends and I agreed that their cookies and creme was one of the best ice creams we've had in our lives. I'm also a very big fan of their dulce de leche. . I should point out that the Jean Philippe at Aria and the one at Bellagio do have slightly different options and some of their flavors presumably rotate.. . Can't recommend Jean Philippe highly enough
I love gelato..they have so so many choices..the nutella crepes are amazing..and key lime pie is the best!  U must try everything
This is a must when you are in Vegas.  Love everything about this place.  It's like you are in a bakery wonderland.  Everything is a work of art.  Their sandwiches are delicious, too.  My only advice would be to check your order before you leave.  One on occasion I was missing a sandwich and it was too much of a hassle to go back to get it.
