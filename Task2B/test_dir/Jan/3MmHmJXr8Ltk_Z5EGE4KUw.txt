Incredible menu! I came with a couple friends for what ended up being a 3 hour dining extravaganza! . . The staff is very attentive and the selections are so awesome! I love the antipasto misto which is a generous selection of meats cured in house. (Mario's family has a amazing deli in Seattle where they also make cured meats) . . The Tagliatelle is covered with sweet earthly porcini mushrooms. I also love rabbit ragu, the lamb ragu and the Anolini which had sweet lobster with it!. . The pork chop was huge!!! I also tried the 3 triple lamb chops which were sooooo melt in your mouth amazing! The short ribs were also quite delicious too!. . The dessert was basically a ton of items the chef sent out to my table. There was panna cotta, a tiramisu, a torte, and canoli. . . The chef also sent out a couple types of Grapa, sorbetti, and gelato. . . It was such a great experience! The bill was probably about $250 a person, but it was pretty awesome!!
The bone in ribeye is simply amazing! Our server Carlos was attentive and knowledgable.  We were checked on by two managers and thought the service was very appealing. Our wine (Italian) was perfectly paired and delicious. The salumi plate showcased several amazing house cured meats and was a nice way to open up. We would come back for sure.  Keep it rockin Carlos, thanks for the recommendations.
I have been to Carnevino several times, and I have never been disappointed. I love walking through the shops at the Palazzo before dinner. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, and they always do a great job accomodating those who eat gluten free. On my last visit, two of my friends were gluten free, and they were able to eat almost everything due to the variety of gluten free options.. . On this visit, I started with Zach's chopped salad with salumi and parmigiano. Delicious!! Our table shared a few pasta dishes. The most notable were the orechiette with sweet sausage and brocolli rabe and the bucatini with amatriciana sauce. I loved the way the orechiette soaked up the sausage bits. Yum! The pancetta in the bucatini dish was fabulous as well.. . One friend and I had the florentine porterhouse for 2 and it was outstanding. They carve the meat tableside, and it is a really fun experience. The beef was perfectly cooked, it was just unfortunate that I was already full by this point. The italian brocolli we had on the side was garlicky and scrumptious. . . We were beyond stuffed by this point, so we passed on dessert, but every option on the menu looked delicious. Carnevino also had a vast selection of Italian wines, and the staff is incredibly helpful in aiding in pairings and such. I can't wait to go back!
This place is definitely one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas based on taste. Pricing is a little outrageous.  Food is cooked in lard which is what makes everything tastes great.  If I made my steaks with lard it would taste great too.. . Ambiance and service is 5 stars.
I have been back two more times since my first visit and have had excellent service and an excellent meal each time.  We always order the riserva steak, and we are always happy.  It seems like hit or miss with other reviewers here, but so far I can't speak highly enough of this place.
Truly a meat lover's paradise.  Got the Beef Tasting menu and overdosed on beef .  BBL Aged ribeye was fantastic.  Carne cruda was excellent.  Highly recommend those 2 dishes.  Tasting menu portions are pretty large so not sure if it would be worthwhile.  You may be better off sharing plates of the same dishes rather than forking out $150 pp.
A good restaurant, but well below my expectations. Delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel. . . The food was fine, but expensive, and not better than Dolminicos, so the decision is easy for me.
Yo player, Carnevino is the trill deal. I broke a "vegan for a month" challenge to eat at this place and let me tell you, I did not regret doing it one bit after my experience.. . My friend and I are like a nice steakhouse team, always looking for the best place that we can find. Lucky for us, Las Vegas provides many options.. . So we go on this spur of the moment trip to Vegas and have already decided that we are going to go to either Craftsteak or Carnevino. What did we do to decide? The same thing everyone else does- look on yelp. When I saw the reviews for Carnevino and how everyone seemed to complain about sub-par service and quality of steak & sides, I wanted to go here about as bad as someone wants to go to an STD clinic to find a date. Forreal, yall m'f*ckas write some compelling ish on this site. . . Anyways, I tried to make a reservation at Craftsteak and they were booked. So were GR Steak and Delmonico. What were we to do? The only thing we could do...make a reservation at Carnevino and accept the punishment our patience and taste buds were about to endure. Boy were we wrong.... . The hostess on the phone was bubbly as can be, made us an immediate reservation and convinced us that this was the best possible choice. I'm easily swayed, so my attitude about this place changed almost immediately.. . We get there and are seated immediately by another (maybe the same) friendly hostess. Ambiance was on point. White table cloth, dim lit, comfortable seats, bookcases, and even a Persian rug! Our server JT was not, and I repeat WAS NOT Justin Timberlake. Disappointing I know, but if you translated his serving skills into  singing skills, he would have been better than Justin Timberlake, word is bond.. . The ciabatta bread was soooooo damn tight! it came with butter, and pig fat blended with spices. Sounds gross, tastes okay; I wouldn't kill a man for it. Unfortunately, this is what kept Carnevino from getting the 5th star. I think they could do better.. . We ordered the Ribeye for 2, mashed potatoes and mushrooms. These dishes... I would kill a man for.. . The mashed potatoes had an effin' poached egg in 'em that one of the homeboys working there broke and mixed in for us! Dude, upon first bite I seriously said out loud "that is what mashed potatoes should taste like. Someone call Merriam-Webster, and tell them that Carnevino just redefined what mashed potatoes are.". . Mushrooms were dope, had a balsamic glaze or something, but not much to elaborate on.. . Most expensive steak houses all taste the same or close to the same with only minor differences between them. The steak at Carnevino was unique and in a class of it's own. There was a perfect crust on the meat, and if you told me that it was only seasoned with salt and pepper, I wouldn't believe you. It was cooked PERFECTLY and was served hot. It was so tender, flavorful and overall perfect that if you told me Jesus himself cooked it, I would totally believe you.. . We received a couple of compliments from the chef, some cheese balls and shortbread cookies, both of which deserve honorable mention.. . In conclusion, If you want amazing service, amazing food, amazing ambiance, but most importantly an amazing experience all at a decent price, go to Carnevino. If you don't want any of those other things, go to Cut and I'm sure you'll be satisfied.
We went to dinner on a Sat night and had wonderful service.  We read the reviews and had the beef cheek ravoli and the pasta that he is known for an the aged steak.  It was good, but not amazing.  We had an amazing dinner the night before and for the price expected more.  The waiter was excellent and took great care to explain all the detail that goes in to making each dish. With such detail, you would expect amazing...and again for the price.  I expected to bite into each dish and say Wow, I have never tasted anything like this...and we had, for less other places.  I think you can do better, but it won't be a bad meal.  However you will leave hundreds of dollars behind!
I ate here with my family back in December of 2012. This was our first time eating here and it did not disappoint. I had the cowboy cut Ribeye for one ($95). My wife and one of our daughters had the filet ($55 each) and my other daughter had the butterfly pork chop ($45). The sides were excellent. Salads fantastic. Wow, and the yukon gold garlic mashed potatoes with marscapone and an egg on top was unbelievable!. . If in vegas, and you want a great steak in a fabulous hotel. This is the place for you
Beautiful resturant in the Palazzo.  It was recommended by a friend of a friend so we decided to check it out.  We knew it was going to be expensive so we were hoping to have socks knocked off... unfortunately that did not happen.  We decided to skip the appetizers an go for "the mid course"...the spaghetti ai frutti di mare..translation spaghetti with some seafood sauteed in a tomatoe based sauce.   The seafood included shrimp, calamari,  scallop and a very, very..small lobster tail - the sauce was very simplistic and lacked depth, the shrimp was not fresh, it had that "bleachy smell/taste" and the pasta was a little too aldente for our taste.  On the positive the rest of the seafood was fresh.  The highlight of this course was actually the freshly baked chabata bread which came to the table warm and steamed when opened.   . . We were also given two cheese fritters (on the house) which resembled doughnut hole that were delicious.   . . For the main course we ordered the dry aged bone in ribeye with three sides - the caulifower, mash potatoes and the eggplant.   Out of the three I would recommend the eggplant and a distance second the potato (which comes with cheese an egg on top of it) - only because it made the potato very heavy and filling.   The caulifower was aweful...under cooked with little or no flavor.. . And now for steak....it was beautiful to look at...it came to the table with two waiters - one of whom preceded to sprinkle some sea salt and olive oil on the steak and carve it up into evenly sliced portions.   We order it medium well and that was achieved,  however after that the flavor and taste were okay..maybe we should have ordered one of the many sauces which came ala carte but was not recommended by our waiter.   Speaking of waiters, we only saw ours three times, once to take our order, once to ask us if we wanted desert and next to give us the bill...the most attention given to us was by a young lady with a water pitcher who would diligently fill our glass of water if she noticed it was not topped off...bless her heart.  On the subject of water, since neither my buddy or myself drink alcohol and are watching our sugar in take we ordered water...what we got was "tap water"....really for the amount of money we paid ($220 +) they could not give us some filtered agua.... . In summary...find another steakhouse that will give you a better value for your money...but if you do decide to go...order the chicken. . . Would recommend Mario Batali (who I am a big fan of) do an "...under cover Boss" to do some QA/QC on this beautiful location.
Beautiful restaurant, but don't want to pay for atmosphere. Grilled octopus was delicious. Chopped salad was ok.    Rib eye for 2  priced at $74. Each was very overpriced.  I did not finished my portion and asked to take with me.  They did not give me what I left on my plate.  Would definitely not recommend.  Service was just ok.  If you have to waste about 2 1/2 to 3 hours for dinner this is the place for you.  Overall very overpriced.  Delmonico Steakhouse is a much better choice at the Palazzo.  Take my advice if you are looking for an excellent steak.
Food was ok, we had steak it was cold and overcooked, we couldn't return it because we waited so long to find our waiter again,  the place was not busy.  Service was poor we had to ask for sides menu since weren't given one and there were no sides on the main menu.  Wine seems bad or old they keep 30 bottles on a table in the middle of restaurant and run it over when you order, but it almost looks like they refill them since wine was nasty, they ran the wine threw napkins when pouring into your glass, gross. ..We went to Delmonicos the next day NYE and had an amazing meal and wonderful time.  Skip this wanna be steak house .
ATTENTION LAS VEGAS !! B&B Hospitality is acquiring all of the best mixology talent in the city!! Act now before it's too late. Actually, it might be too late already. Carnevino has built what I believe is thebar staff equivalent of the New York Yankees. I think some were even wearing pinstripes! And not only that, their 2nd stringers make better cocktails than a lot of first string teams in that city.. . As far as I can tell it's Adam Rains and Eric Hobbie who go yard on every cocktail. Now I'm not talking about making the best gimlet or manhattan (which they may) I am talking about sitting down at the bar and saying something like "I like the smell of the desert after it rains. Make me a cocktail." or "I love pepper but hate cinnamon. Make me a cocktail." or  "I like the smell of a rosemary garden but only when the sun is 3 o'clock high on odd numbered days in August. Make me a cocktail". Or by just simply ordering off the menu and having them pair it with whatever concoction they deem fit. They might have something in their repertoire to fit your needs or they might just create a brand new cocktail right there in front of you.  These guys are at the forefront of the the new mixology scene in Las Vegas and are contenders for The World Series every season.. . Next at the plate we have David Cooper and Dominick. I didn't have as many cocktails by these guys but they are also first stringers on the Bronx bombers of the strip and I can't wait to experience more from them on my next trip out. Dominick is a monster at egg white cocktails (a personal favorite of mine) and made some very stunning examples. He may have even converted a non-cocktail drinker with one of them based around scotch.. . I also had a couple of cocktails by Jay. He was just brought up from the farm team and has great natural ability and instinct but still looks to the veterans for assistance. But this in and of itself shows that he has respect for the art and knows there is work to be done. You don't ever want to call this kind of thing too early but with his enthusiasm and eagerness to learn and a lot of work, I wouldn't be surprised to see him in Cooperstown one day with the rest of the players mentioned above.. . Supposedly Carnevino is some sort of steakhouse. Best on the strip some say. Best in the country some say. But I wouldn't know. I go here for world class cocktails and I end up learning as much as I do drinking. Well... slightly more drinking than learning but you catch my drift. My point being, don't let the lack of some trendy nuvo hipster mixology moniker or the fact that this is a steakhouse and not a "bar" scare you cocktail junkies away. Hit this place early, grab a seat, and be sure to wear your batting helmet because you won't want to leave until you fall off your stool.
You didn't offer a Zero. This place has good food but is overpriced and the music they pipe in that prohibits conversation should get someone an opportunity in another industry.
Great good but very pricey. I have eaten here a few times all with same results. Good food, good wine, good service and huge bill at the end of the night. . . If you are looking for a quick dinner I HIGHLY recommend sitting in the bar and getting the Carnavino Burger. Has to be the best burger on the planet. The beef cheek ravioli and octopus are both outstanding starters as well. . . Word of caution and the reason I gave four stars and not five. The sommelier poured our wine and then poured himself a short glass to drink. This was not a taste before he poured ours it was a few good drinks worth that he took as a "roady". I likely would not have cared if he asked first but it's a little annoying since it was a $250 bottle of wine and he did it as it was a course of regular business. . . Overall good place for a burger or steak if you are held captive at the Palazzo or Venetian at a conference.
Great place although very expensive.  The service is good but strange.  People seem not to be trained in working in fine food. Very good but ordinary service. Atmosphere is nice but the music was very loud and all Elton John. Strange for Italian fine dining.
This place was good but not the you have to be careful about the temperature of the steak when you order..... Medium is really Medium Rare.
Vibe - Grande lux steakhouse. Price-- Very expensive. Service- non existent . Bathrooms- Very good. Wine service- Excellent. Wine Prices- Extreme. . This is my third visit to this place. My first review was a rave review for Carnevino. Tonight it all changed. The service was so off that it ruined our dinning experience.  The main course was served while we were still eating our salads. After that the servers disappeared. No bread refills no filled water glasses etc. we even had more guests join us. But the staff did not extend our table until we asked five times. We even had to ask for menus for our two guests three times. . . Caprese Salad- great presentation. Cherry tomatoes on the vine, creamy delicious basil pesto and burata. . Chopped salad- good. . Ribeye BBL $144 for two and the Porterhouse $144 were both huge like on previous visits and satisfied.. . Brussels sprouts were burned. Mashed potatoes with poached egg and ham was excellent. Brocollini was tasty. . Desserts- Skip them. Cannoli, coconut flan, spoiled cheese tiramisu and the whiskey cream are not worth the calories . I couldn't believe the server said the marscapone was not spoiled. The entire table spit out the tiramisu. I guess we were wrong. . . The management was so off tonight that I can no longer recommend Carnevino. The staff is trained to upsell and push apps and drinks that it forgets the most important thing, the customer.. . WIGB- No
Visited this establishment with my uncle, who frequents Delmonico, but wanted to give this a try.. . We arrived about 10 minutes early and were told there was one couple to be seated ahead of  us, but we could have a seat at the bar. There was no seating at the bar, so we ended up standing at the end of it in front of the cocktail station. Maybe that was bad bar etiquette on my part, but still. Considering we were standing right in front of the bartender, we were never even offered a drink or a better place to wait.. . I don't have much to say about the food. I ordered the salmon, medium. It was cooked to perfection, but really lacked flavor, and the brussel sprouts were burned and oily. I've had much better at Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill at a much lower price. . . After we received our entrees, our waiter was not to be seen again. He did not even return to check on the meal. He only came back to up-sell us on dessert, which also was unimpressive. We ordered the pistachio gelato, which was nothing to write home about. . . Honestly, the best part of my meal was the dry rose I had at the beginning and the blood orange tea I had at the end of it. The tea was wonderful, and the young girl that brought it to us (see also was very attentive about our water the entire night), gave us the best service out of everyone. . . My uncle, who is VIP at many establishments in Vegas, left saying "Delmonico is much better."
