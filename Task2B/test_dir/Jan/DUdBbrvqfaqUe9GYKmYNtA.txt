I'm going to give this hotel four stars because the people are always so nice to us and take care of us but there are cracks that need to be fixed.  First of all we go to Vegas at least three or four times a year and always stay at the Mirage.  we like the fact it's smaller and more intimate than the bigger hotels and the Oasis pool is wonderful.  However, their rooms are starting to show their age and need a huge makeover.  We were sitting in our room and heard water running.  Went in the bathroom only to find water pouring out of the light fixture over the shower from the room above.  Called maintenance, someone showed up but did nothing and left.  We could see where the ceiling had buckled.  Since we were in a tower king room, there is supposed to be a whirlpool bath - there was a sign how to operate it but the tub was just a regular tub.  On top of that I contacted the CEO to let him know of the problems, never received a reply.  Not good form for repeat customers.    Only one who seemed concerned was our casino host who I contacted when we returned home.
Nice restaurants, cool lobby, and pretty cool volcano show. . . The rooms are excellently decorated and the beds are comfortable however the doors are so thin you can knock them down and roll joints with them. It's noisy but luckily it's Vegas so it's mostly drunk sleeps anyway.. . Very spotty internet - disconnects every few websites. Makes it hard to write Yelp reviews.
Perfect service and excellent rooms! I had awesome experience and definitely will use it again.
Wowza! What a fabulous hotel! You walk in and are inundated with Vegas - a giant aquarium greets you as you check-in, there are advertisements for all the Mirage shows, everything is slightly gaudy and glitzy and loud. Then, after check-in, you step into a gorgeous atrium that borders the casino. Having never really been in Vegas, I didn't know that you always have to walk through the casino to get to your rooms. We had a two bedroom suite, so got our own set of elevators...how fancy! Our room was stupendous! It was on the "A" level, with fabulous furnishings accented in red, lots of space, an amazing master bath, and a complimentary fruit bowl. The only downside was that the windows were covered in the outside wrap that advertises "Love," the Mirage show, so it kind of blurred the otherwise stupendous views.
Stayed at the Mirage on New Years Eve. They have made many changes for the better. Casino floor has all new everything room was super clean and the TV's brand new. I stayed here 2 other times in the past and I see so much positive improve my I had to share. . . Happy new year!
We're do I start. Well first I want to say that I use to love the mirage but after my last experience there I'm not comming back . My sister and I went to Vegas because we we're attending the latin grammys we were staying 3 nights . The first night we were there our room had two room I assumed because the door was open and the way the room was angled it made sense so I stayed in the other room but that was not the case security came the next morning and told me that's not part of your room I said (politely ) I'm sorry the door was open and I assumed it was one big room . Then security told me "well you have 15 min to get out or I'll make you get out" ummmm ok so I moved to the other room no problem and house keeping came and locked the door that joined the two seperate rooms . That evening at 5 am first a women opened the supposably locked door and told my sister and I to get out this was part of there room and we told her no it's not just the door now . Then she does 2 seconds later her husband opens the door (mind u thank god we weren't sleeping in our underwear) and starts yelling at us and we call security and they came and " re locked" the door . Then ! That next evening ( our last night) my sister and I went to dinner for 1 hour! We came back to our room to find that the other people broke open the door from the joining room and went through our things and stole my wallet my LV wallet at that and! Smoked mrijana in our room . We called the manager and they moved us to a other room but that's it! No complimary room they didn't offer our money back Nothing ! I could not believe our experience there ! So awful ! So please beware! And make sure you hide our always keep ur belongings in a safe place if u stay there
Parts are new and some parts are old. I'd rsate the room cleanliness about a 4 (on a scale of 1 to 10). If you like residual pubic hair in the bathroom floor, carpet and bed  from previous guests, then you'll have a festival at The Mirage.. Carnegie Deli (for breakfast a la carte) seats about 20 people, so bring your patience with you.
I feel like home at the Mirage. I've been staying here for over 8 years and have nothing but great things to say about the rooms, service, the Carnegie Deli, the pool, it's all classic Vegas with updated decor. . . The Mirage is in my favorite part of the strip which is centrally located next to Treasure Island, Caesars, and across the street from the Venetian/Palazzo.
The Mirage is kind of the Mendoza line of strip hotels.  Everything is nice, but not glamorous.  The prices are a little high, but not ridiculous.  The buffet is okay, but there are better.  Table limits can get a little high, but Casino Royale is across the street.. . If you want to walk the strip, this is a good place to stay.  I personally enjoy driving around and hitting downtown.  The Mirage is in a tough spot to get your car in and out.  If you can stay here at a deep discount or on a comp, I would not hesitate.
The Mirage screwed up by sending me to a room that wasn't only booked but already occupied. This was annoying considering I had to walk through the casino with my luggage to get back to the front desk an then back to the new room. Without even complaining they upgraded me from the Resort King to the Tower King. I asked for a room with a strip view they accommodated me. If it wasn't for that I'd give them 3 stars. . . The room wasn't as modern as some Vegas hotels but it's not ancient. The casino isn't big but it isn't small. I would've liked more restaurant choices. The only choices for breakfast were Carnegie Deli which was packed and the buffet which was expensive. Paradise Cafe was closed for the season and the other restaurants were only open for lunch and dinner. I wasn't impressed with the nightclub 1 Oak but I can't blame that on the hotel. . . I like the location of this hotel. It's kind at the middle/north end of the strip. While the view from my strip view room wasn't as great as some hotels it was still very good. Although I haven't been there recently, I highly recommend going to Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. . . I'd consider staying here again for the right price but not until I try out other hotels first.
Just checked out this morning after a 4 night stay.  This is a solid hotel but next time I will stay elsewhere, probably the Bellagio.  The standard rooms are spacious but as others have said here, the bathrooms are TINY.  Closet is very small, too.  The bathrooms are about 5' wide (just wide enough for double sinks) and about 8-9' long.  Tub is just a standard crappy tub with a curved shower bar.  There are nicer bathrooms in low end Marriotts.  The beds were comfy and it's a plus that they had two queens in a room and not doubles.  . . Overall the hotel and casino feel a little run down and the clientele leaves a bit to be desired.  I think the Mirage's best days are over.
I had a legitimate beef with my stay at the Mirage.  Upper management got involved and they did the right thing by me.  This is a beautiful hotel and their rooms will not disappoint you; try and get one facing their volcano display if possible.
This was my first time staying here and I was impressed. The room was very nice. We had made a reservation for a king size bed room but when we arrived they didn't have any available so they gave us a two queen size bed room with a strip view instead. It was a very nice upgrade. We could look out of our window and not only see the strip but see the dolphins playing in the Secret Garden.. The bed was soft but still firm. The room was very clean and they maintained that every day. My girlfriend and I had a good laugh over some of the interesting items in the mini bar. Some of them weren't too unreasonably priced considering it was a mini bar in the room. We of course did buy anything but if you really need something you wouldn't be completely robbed.. A few times we needed a wake up call just to make sure we got to some breakfast reservations that we had made. The people on the phone were very nice and the call came exactly when we asked for it.. Parking was easy. Some times you get a great spot if you are lucky. It was easy to find everything. I only got lost once. By the time we left I had the layout down.. I would stay here again but I also want to try some of the other hotels on the strip.
Stayed in the one bedroom suite at the Mirage and loved it! One of the best hotel experiences. Our room was beautiful and had so many little extras. Our jacuzzi tub came with bath salts and the bathroom had a toothbrush, toothpaste, and razor, and shave cream. Overall we just loved the room and the service we received while staying there.
This place sucks. . With so many places to stay in Las Vegas Why would anyone stay at the Mirage? My wife had a conference at the Mirage so we were stuck there.. . As my daughter and I were walking through the casino (the only way to get to the elevators fron the front) one of the casino bosses rather rudely informed me that kids aren't allowed in the casino.. . Our daughter was looking forward to swimming in the pool unfortunately there wasn't any water in it. The Jacuzzi was cold with cigar butts and ashes around the edge. Great for a kid.  . . When we got out vehicle from the Valet we found that they broke part of the door handle. Now every time I go to open the drivers side door the trim falls off and we're reminded the lousy care we received. . . Of course they won't take responsibility for the damages.. . Las Vegas as a whole is a bit of a let down, just a bunch of drunken squank. I fail to see the appeal of Las Vegas. I guess you got to be drunk the appreciate it.
Excellent service all round, especially the front desk, rooms are great particularly for an older hotel, bang in the middle of the Strip action, great value.
