FYI: There's a Wolfgang Puck Express in the MGM on yelp that is actually referring to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill in the MGM. Not sure where the confusion is coming from, but just a heads up. It's a nice open platform across from the Cirque Du Soleil Ka theater that serves decent pasta, and also offers meat (burgers) dishes, seafood dishes, and assorted appetizers. . . Came around for dinner and were seated, water glasses filled, and drink orders taken almost immediately. They have unlimited, complimentary bread, which was delicious! Majority of the menu was either spaghetti, pizza, or meat (burger, fish, steak). We all ordered a different type of spaghetti. I'd highly recommend the linguini with Manila Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Chili, Wild Oregano because out of all four dishes, that one was the best. My friend did add lemon to give it a little kick.. . We ordered two marinara sauces - Housemade spaghetti and spaghetti&meatballs. They're your generic spaghetti with basil, tomatoes, and garlic, only differences was the type of tomatoes and that one had meatballs and one did not. Both of these dishes were so, so, SO salty that I drank about three giant gulps of water per spaghetti bite. And normally, I LOVE salt. I had pee like crazy pregnant woman afterwards. o___o. . The last dish we ordered was the Wild Mushroom Agnolotti, Sweet Peas, Caramelized Shallots, Parmesan. It was pretty good if you like more dough-y, lightly sauced pasta. I personally did not like it and felt it could be more flavorful, but each to their own. Also, they don't put salt or pepper shakers on the table (arrogant? or doing a classy look?) and they did not offer parmesan (even though they offered the table next to us parmesan. hmm why?).. . Overall, food: 3/5. Service: 3.5/5.
Delicious pizza!  Can't wait to go back.  Service was awesome and I loved the atmosphere.

We decided to eat here on a whim before our KA! show and it was a pretty good pick. We got there at around 7:30PM on a Monday night and there was no wait for a table for 7 people. We were seated promptly and our server was there almost immediately to take our drink orders. The menu is not extensive, but that was a plus for me as we were in a bit of a rush. The prices seemed a bit steep (I mean $27 for spaghetti and meatballs?! Common!), but the portions were quite large and we all had trouble trying to finish our meals.. . Food:. Meatball Pizza--This is a very good sized pizza and I could only get through about half of it before I hit my limit. It was pretty good but there was a bit too much meat on it for my liking, especially for a thin crust pizza.. Spicy Spaghetti and Meatballs-- This was pretty good, but for $27 I'd pass.. Cheeseburger-- I haven't actually tried this but everyone on my table who ordered it had no leftovers so...it must have been aight..... Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese sauce-- These are soooooo good! If you like blue cheese or cheese in general you'll love this! Oh how I wish I had some in front of me right now!. French Fries-- Would I go back to a restaurant specifically to eat french fries? If they were Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill french fries, hell yeah! So good!. . Service was quick and our drinks never ran low. Overall a pretty good pick.
DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!!!!!The only restaurant still open atthe MGM after 10:00 PM. My sister and I ordered a salad and it was over whelmed with raw onion.  So all I could taste was onion.  So I told the waitress that the salad was over whelmed with onion and I couldn't eat it.  She had a attitude so I just decided not to reorder anything.  Then the manager came and try to fix the situation and offered me something else.  So I decided to get chicken noodle soup.  That's pretty basic it hard to mess up soup so I thought.  It was flavor less and there was veins threw out the chicken.   I was done at that point and grossed out.  You would think that a restaurant of that stature would make sure there food was Delicious.  The whole time we were eating the waitress was giving us attitude.  Big mistake,  I would have left you a great tip after all your not the cook idiot!
Meh, expected more from a such a well known name, then again I doubt how much influence Wolfgang Puck himself has in this place. Location is actually horrible, it's an open layout overlook the Cirque Ka theatre (which filled up quickly) and the smell of smoke from the nearby casino nearly made me lose my appetite. Food itself was so-so. For appetizer we ordered the crispy fried calamari, pretty good although I would have preferred marinara over the lemon aioli. For entree I ordred the white pizza with chicken, spinach, garlic and feta. Pizza is large enough for 2 people to share, I barely ate half and boxed the rest. Once again, alright but nothing to brag about. Husband ordered the grilled salmon, once again nothing special. Which is my ultimate conclusion about this place, alright food, nothing special. With the plethora of options in Vegas and on the strip, I would pass on this one unless you are looking for something convenient and moderately priced. Side note, right across from this restaurant is Joel Robuchon, a 5 star (and extremely price) French place. What a dichotomy of choices !
Usually I like this place as I have been many times but this time I did not like the food. The caesar salad was too spicey and I had to ask for a new one. Te new one did not have peepers but still tasted spivey. I got a margarita pizza and ask for ham and mushroom toping but they did not have ham. They offered pruciutu instead , which I accepted, big mistake as it tasted horrible. Service was ok so I am giving it a 3 since other times I have liked their food here.
It seems like every time we come to Vegas we always end up here for brunch. Of course food here is delicious, I haven't bad anything that I didn't enjoy from here. However, the wait time for the food to get to your table could get a little long depending on the time of the day. . . Steak skewers and the French style omelette are my very favorite. Cannot wait to come back next time and try their pizza!
Had a late lunch here one day and was very happy. Shared the steak skewers and the meatball pizza. They were both very good. Service was great, although it may have been because it was an awkward time and we were almost in the restaurant by ourselves. Very good!
Excellent food and prices unlike Most Vegas restaurants in the main hotels they are not pushy or posh. Simply good food at reasonable prices on a main hotel. (MGM)
I came here for dinner with my boyfriend. We ordered the $38 steak, $26 linguini with clams, $11 potato chips, and $16 steak skewers.. . The food was great, the service was the best I ever had. The staff is so friendly!
Excellent food and fun atmosphere. I've been coming here for several years and we have never been disappointed. . This is a great bistro with excellent dishes at reasonable prices.. Even eating at the restaurant bar is very pleasant.. Our server tonight is Sara and she is exceptional.. I would recommend getting a reservation on weekends which is very easy to do.
What's the top go-to food that's thought of as a classic Vegas drunchie meal? . . Steak and Eggs, baby.. . And I'm surprised to say this but Wolfgang serves up an awesome steak and eggs dish. Pricey ($~29.00), yes, but it's totally worth the extra bucks. Not to mention, the plate can easily be shared between two if you aren't super hungry (but you know you need something in your stomach to deter a potential hangover in the morning). . . Grilled Steak and Eggs with Tuscan Potatoes and Herb Hollandaise Sauce. Mmm doesn't that just sound good to you? . . The steak, ordered medium rare, was cooked beautifully (none of that tough dry steak nonsense here). Loved how as soon as I cut into the meat with my steak knife, the firm flesh revealed a warm red center. Juicy, flavorful, well-seaseoned deliciousness.. . My friend and I asked for sun side up eggs, which were perfect for eating right over toast (you can choose sourdough, wheat or white, served with butter or jam on the side), and them tuscan potatoes were bombdiggity. They reminded me of smashed potatoes except they were prepared in a way where crispiness was not compromised. Dip with ketchup and you've struck gold. . . I don't think I could eat steak and eggs anywhere else... I've been spoiled so. I'll be sure to return the next time I'm in Vegas for crazy drunken shenanegans!
I was not very impressed. I had the prime rib burger and it was overly greasy and the mayo or whatever sauce was on it was too much. The fries were tasty though.  . . Overall you can get a better meal elsewhere, but I will say the price is fairly reasonable for the location right in the middle of the casino.
Menu offers nice choices after hours, a rare thing in Vegas. Most other after hours places have very limited menus. The food, however, is average or mediocre, acceptable but far from great. It's not bad, but not too enticing either. Portions are fair, deserts satisfactory. Service is good, one of the redeeming points. Extra points for being open all night. But overall, you'll eat there because there are very few better choices after hours, not because of the yummy factor.
Awesome crispy roasted potatoes with the ribeye.  Service needs some work. Good food and atmosphere. Worth a try, just good luck with an upbeat server.
I was at the MGM for an afternoon of playing and decided to stop at Wolfgang's for lunch.. I was immediately seated at a nice table and the server was there before I sat down. He took a drink order and was right back. He was very attentive and knowledgeable.. I had the fish and chips, the fries were awesome the fish was pretty good. The slaw was also good. He told me locals get a free dessert. I had the Creme Boule. It was really good!. All in all a enjoyable lunch. The staff was great the food was wonderful!
