Slow and rude service and terrible food.  You have to be drunk to enjoy this place.  On the upside, the beer is nice (however unmemorable).
This place is great. I know it's a chain now and I was here for it's opening years ago, and I've been to the real Hofbrauhaus in Germany, and I can still say this place is worth it. It's always a fun experience with all the excitement of the bands, singing, dancing, classic bits, and entertainment. The food is great, although it doesn't top Cafe Heidelberg, but here you get all the entertainment and I think that place closed anyway. This place is a Vegas MUST!
You want a good time with fantastic entertainment, come here!!!! It's always Octoberfest!!! Friday and Saturdays is the best. They have a drinking contest and a stein holding contest. The good is good and the beer is great!  It's roughly $14 for the huge stein of beer. If you win any contest you get to keep your stein which is rad! I take my friends here who are visiting and they always have fun.
Without a doubt, I enjoyed the food and German beer that was served.  The servers did a good job and were playfully entertaining.  Unfortunately, there were two big negatives that detracted from the experience:. . First, the room is so noisy that you can't have a conversation with your fellow diners without literally shouting at each other.  There is a pretty even mix of crowd noise and live band music.  The band's sound was lost in the noisy room, but from what I could hear, they were not very good.  The seemed to alternate between trying to play German beer hall music and playing old pop hits...like CCR songs.  They need to decide what they are trying to be.. . Second, when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  Based on that alone, I will not be returning for another meal.
Atmosphare super, Essen Kantinen Niveau, Preise hoch.. Fraglich ist ob dieser Hofbrau Abkommling schwarze Zahlen schreibt. Irgendwie beschleicht einen das Gefuhl, dass die Idee zwar super ist, aber wirtschaftlich nicht aufgeht. Recht uberschaubare Gasteschar an zwei Terminen, die Halle ist einfach zu gro, dass wirklich Stimmung aufkommt. Auch wirkt das ganze Konzept recht aufgegockelt, eher Fasching Style. Man will dem Amerikaner hier was vorspielen, wie Bayern ist. Fraglich ist, warum andere Nationen wie japanische Restaurants oder chinesische Restaurants das nicht notig haben. Die sind weltweit einfach authentisch, wir mussen einen auf Fasching machen. Warum?
Nice "German" restaurant.  Great selection of dishes except for lack of pork knuckle (Haxen) on the menu during week nights (I was informed that they only serve that on Saturdays) and chicken Schnitzel (not terribly authentic I know, but a few people in our party preferred that).. . Ambiance: Very nice.  A bit noisy, but we were there to have fun, and noise comes with beer and fun!. . Experience:  It was fun - saw a lot of guys get slapped on their back side with wooden paddles ... the servers that were doing it were not showing any mercy!  The music was a bit weird:  American music performed by what looked like a German band in German style ... I didn't get that!  . . Service:  Helpful servers.  She answered all our questions nicely.  Food was served on time.. . Food:  Pretty good but I guess it could have been better.  I had their pork in hunter style (a thick sauce with mushrooms) with Spaetzle.  . . Credit Card:  Why do they want to charge a fee of 3% if you use a credit card?  Why can't they pay around 2% credit card fee like every other restaurant?  Is this a way to push you to pay your bill in cash?  This didn't make sense, and it was not convenient at all.
This place is 100% authentic.....if your standard of authenticity permits the use of Oscar Meyer hot dogs in a German restaurant.. . I can't believe people think this place is good. I remember going there with a friend. I started off with a German salad. It sucked. I felt like I was eating a turd salad. When I received my entree, we both kind of looked at my plate and my friend acknowledged before I could say anything that it was indeed a hot dog that had been placed on my plate instead of a German sausage as advertised.. . I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.. . This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!. . I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.. . And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard. And don't forget to play some annoying German music and sing "ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy".
Great place to go if you feel like some bratwursts, beer and some loud music while having some good time. I got the plate with 4 different sausages and my wife got the Wiener Schnitzel with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, of course. half a littler of Heffewiesen went down pretty easy after all that food! It was early and kind of empty and the live music was loud, something that I would probably enjoy later in the day and after some more beers. Good for a break from the strip if you have the time or exhausted your options there.
Great place to go off the beaten path in Vegas if you want to escape the casinos! Great atmosphere, great food and beer, and great service! I had a combo sausage platter appetizer that was excellent! Everyone is in a great mood at this place! I definitely plan to visit again!
Love the fun and festive atmosphere here!. . I've tried a good amount of food here on a couple of occasions, and I think it's just the German cuisine that I don't have the palate for...Don't get me wrong, the food is good and enjoyable, but nothing really stands out to me.  Come here for the drinks and the atmosphere!. . I'd recommend trying the Fresh Baked Pretzel to start. Love it! All the dipping sauces were great too...and this thing is huge!  Very sharable.... . I've tried most of the Sausages, Potatoes, Spatzl and Sauerkraut. My favorites were definitely the sausages and potatoes!  They all have unique tastes...but no extraordinary items to touch base.. . And definitely try their Hofbrauhaus Hefeweizen. It is outstanding! . . To finish, we tried the Hofbrauhaus Sweet Platter: Kirschtort, Tiramisu & Cheesecake. They were all pretty good, and came with a melted creme cheese like sauce for dipping/pouring :). . Have fun!
We came out here for a friend's birthday on Friday night.. . Being an avid yelper, I decided to read up on some reviews. . After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  I was really worried that  I wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...I'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol. . So...we got there, and walked in, and were seated.... What a HUGE hall!  . At first, I was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  Oddly enough, the more I ate and drank, the better I felt. ;). . The atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  . Its loud.  There is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.. I had a blast.. . I personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  Maybe in the bedroom with someone I know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :). . Now onto what was ordered:. . Beer:. I ordered the Hefeweizen, which was awesome.  The half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...I'm a slow beer drinker.  The other beers were really good too.  (I tasted everyone's.). . Food:. I ordered:. A pretzel:  Pretty good.  Salty, but not overly so.  . The potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  THIS was delicious.  I'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  The salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (I'll upload a picture as soon as I can.). German Potato Soup:  This was DELICIOUS!  My favorite of the night. :). The Majoram/ (Veal sausages):  Since I'm not a big fan of pork products, I had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when I saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...Iopted for those.  They were tasty.  2 sausages served over mashed potatoes, with a red cabbage sauerkraut.  (I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage.). . All in all the quality of the food was good.  . However.... Between myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  . I could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.
I've been to the real thing in Munich. This is not at all the same thing. Also, I didn't have a very good time:. . - I didn't see a single beer come out that wasn't under-poured. There's a line on the glass for a reason.. - Service was incredibly slow.. - The waiter billed my beer wrong and instead of fixing it threw random cash at me to not tell his boss.. . Also it's off the strip, which makes it kind of a pain to get to.
