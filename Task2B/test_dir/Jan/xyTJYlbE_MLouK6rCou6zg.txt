Vine a este resturante porque era recomendado como el mejor de Las Vegas de hamburguesas.  Llevaba espectativas muy altas porque me gustan mucho las hamburguesas.  Pedi una de cordero, que la carne estaba muy bien hecha y de buen sabor.  Pero definitivamente no han sido mis mejores hamburguesas.  Si recomiendo ir, talvez no debi de haber pedido esa.
We were so excited to come here given all the great reviews, but we were unfortunately disappointed. Our food took almost an hour and when it came there were several mistakes. Our medium well burger was medium, there were no grilled onions on my burger and my friend's burger had an egg that was not cooked all the way through (even though he specifically asked for that). Pluses were the fries (we tried every kind), the truffle mayo and the hang over sauce and the salted carmel sundae. The Kobe burger was just ok.
I had the Hubber Keller's favorite but instead of Buffalo had it Angus Beef and it was delicious. My wife built her own and it was spectacular!. . One star off: "Skinny" French Fries weren't as skinny as I was hoped. They were more like regular McDONALD'S fries except 1000% better! And building your own Burger can get expensive quickly!
As far as veggie burgers are, this is an elite burger! You can get it with 30+ toppings, and no mattet how you havevit, you can't go wrong! Love love love!
Great burger, delicious onion rings and friendly staff. We even had our own tv in the booth to watch football games. . . We came early and had no problem getting a table. The only downside, was the really, really nasty ladies room. Call me a snob, but that is an important aspect of the total dining experience.
Burger Bar is a lunch-in-Vegas staple. The sweet potato fries are excellent, and the meat is always fresh and all-natural, if not organic. I generally order a buffalo or kobe burger, and every burger I have had has been cooked perfectly to my specifications.. . Next time, I will try an adult milkshake. Yum! But I try not to overdo it on lunch in Vegas because my friend and I always do big dinners when we meet up in Vegas it seems.... . A friend recommended Burger Bar to me the first time I ever came to Vegas, and I have been every time since. It's really so much fun!
Its ok i liked their burgers.
An amazingly specific type of burger with lots and lots of truffle options. Ended up spending something like 30-40 $ on my super customized burger but it was worth it considering what I'd been paying for everything in Vegas.
So the first three times we went here, 5 stars for the food, and 4 stars for the service.  . This time, 2 stars for the food and 0 stars for the waitress.. . New Years week my sister was in town and we decided to take her there since she has never been to Vegas.  Unfortunately nothing we told her was true this day.. . Our meals came our before our appetizer, our drinks were not refilled even once, and ALL of our orders were wrong.  Every single one, and two people ordered a salad, which I feel like should be the easiest thing to make.  Every time we asked our waitress for something she wouldn't even let you finish your sentence before she walked away.. . None of us left anymore than some change and in the tip section I reminded her that "NOT EVERYONE IS A TOURIST, SERVICE DOES MATTER".
The waitress was not a fake "over the top" nice waitress but rather a more genuine nice person. The burger as cooked perfectly and the ingredients were high quality. I also asked a milkshake that was pretty good. To finish off they also have Italian expresso! Perfect meal! I definitely recommend.
Kobe burger was pretty good and the chicken wings (hot) were a nice side. Fries were tasty and the service was alright. Not a fantastic meal but would eat here again next trip to Mandalay Bay.
We stopped in at around 8PM on a Friday night and only waited about 10 mins for a table for 6. Our server was on point even though he was also tending to a table of about 16 and upon getting seated had our drink order put in.. . The restaurant was quite skinny but went back quite a bit with the bar to your right going almost the entire depth of the restaurant. The atmosphere was great, kind of like a sport bar/club/family restaurant...if that makes any sense. We had a booth towards the back of the restaurant which had its own TV with a college game on. The music was loud and you almost have to whisper into someones ear to be heard, but that why the atmosphere was so great!. . The food was drool-worthy! I had the Hubert Keller burger with bacon and it was awesome. It was a good sized burger with wine reduction shallots, sauteed spinach and blue cheese, it came with skinny fries (which were just ok) and was about $28. Our table also ordered onion rings, which were also just ok, and mozzarella sticks, which were pretty good.. . Everyone pretty much licked their plates clean (even the one in our party who ordered the Vegas Vegan) so it must have been pretty good. Common, Hawaii, you need to get your burger game on!
Just a great burger.. . Waiter was great and helpful. We designed our burgers. Unfortunately they made two if them wrong.. . Burgers tasted great. Beer menu is huge and has some great beers available.. . Kobe burger is a must. Those who didn't order it...regretted it.
I absolutely love coming here. The food is fantastic, the staff is very accommodating and friendly. I love bringing people who are visiting and locals, as well.
Great food...Great service
I love Hubert but,  not impressed.  I wanted to love this burger, I wanted to crave this burger in between trips to Vegas. It was overpriced and underwhelming.  I'm sad
Horrible burger. Pale color, no flavor, pretty bun but very greasy. Fries were delicious, fresh and hot. Service was ok. For a place called burger anything you'd expect good burgers. This isn't it.
Best burger experience ive ever had so far in vegas!. . When we got there me and my bf had already perused the menu all week deciding what we wanted to order so I was thrilled that the food lived up to my stupidly high expectations. . . I ordered the burger sliders as an attempt to test my taste buds to see if I could tell the difference between the different kinds of meat. Long story short...I couldnt. But it was still nice to get a variety of toppings on each one so that you dont get bored. The best thing though for me was stealing some of my bfs truffle mayo (which like all the condiments/sauces comes on the side) and putting it on each of my sliders. It was sooooo goood. Now im a sucker for anything with truffle so thumbs up for that. One thing they should do is let you order some of their toppings even if you are not making your own burger. Next time I think id want to try the truffle sauce. . . Bfs burger was kobe with foie grais and some other stuff. He said he couldnt really taste the quality of the kobe either. The kicker was the foie grais which they give a generous amount of. Next time he said he would just order the angus meat as long as he had the foie grais. . . Even as we were leaving and throughout that weekend I could not stop thinking about those little burgerw with truffle mayo. Burger bar I will be back!
Awesome Bison burger!!
Truly the most overrated burger I have ever had.  Please dont go there thinking this is some super place because it is not.   Totally, totally over priced, 4 of us went there for my birthday and all ordered different burgers.  One in our party order the Classic burger....you should have seen the tomato and lettuce on the plate...NO way that was cut fresh for that burger.   $15 for a chef in the back to pull old tomatoes out of a bin.  I ordered the Peppercorn burger which arrived barely warm at best.  $16, really???? Milk shakes were OK but nothing special...all in all, $120 for 4 People, for lukewarm burgers with old garnish.   NEVER again,,,,,go to Steak and Shake,   better burgers and you will have $80 bucks in your pocket.   I just hope this review saves one person the Dissapointment I had on a Birthday dinner
Been here a few times, and Burger Bar is great.  I love Hubert Keller restaurants, and Burger Bar is his casual burger place.  I have always had a great meal, with good service.  The TVs that they have in the Booths were great for watching football.. . We came here on a Sunday late morning, and with football and pitchers of beer, this meal made for a great Sunday Funday.  You can't really go wrong with your selection, as long as you put on the burger what you like.  Great idea, great food, great service, great atmosphere.
Very happy with service and food and staff. The BBQ and buffalo burgers were great. Med-well pink trough out as I requested. Try the fry sampler. Highly recommend oh yah try the shakes.
Not sure if can add anything too restaurant that has over thousand reviews. Why not?? It was not even my idea but after pre drinking for concert at the House of Blues, no dinner, and concert of heavy metal Amon Amarth nothing better then going carnivore style. Me and two other friends went too concert headed up too Burger Bar. I always wanted too check it out just never got around too it. Now knowing location so close too House of Blues looking for greasy food soak up the alcohol Burger Bar solid solid choice. . . It was my first time so had no idea the menu worked. None of us have ever been here so asked our waiter questions. He did awesome job of explaining everything too us. You can either build your own burger or go with ones that have on the menu. We optioned for the the ones that not build your own cause other ones it comes with fries. Maybe the build your own does but as far from my four PBR recollection or more  in could is negative. LOL!  I had the Peppercorn Burger. It was awesome. I know drinking but still the balance between the dijon mustard spread and the peppercorns (plus the peppercorn cream sauce serve on the side; put some of that cream-a-licous on top) slice tomato, lettuce, and onion. It was nice hearty burger at the perfect time in life. The burger meat was cooked perfect medium. The only thing that was disappointment was the fries was average at best. The burger which reality is the reason come here was Awesome. . . Service could not say what an amazing job our waiter did! Not only with the questions. Two of my friends had the craving for nice over easy egg on top of their Hangover burger. You can add too the burgers already on the menu item ones. One of my friends notice his egg was way over done. The waiter apologize went back fixed the problem and came back with perfectly cooked over easy egg. You know perfect second break that seal have the egg yolk spreading all over its the bomb. Just knowing that do over easy egg right way on any burger. Always reason for me too go back! . . Pricey. It Hubert Keller and on the strip so comes as no surprise. Too see $60 burger on menu blows my mind. Still most of the burgers average $15-20. I think your definitely getting quality burger. Fries could be better and meet the standards they set with the burgers. Just my take.
Solid burgers, but not sure if it's worth the price. I got the American Classic burger. The bun was nice and soft and the bacon was crisp. Wish the cheese was a bit more melted. I ordered it medium, but it came out to be more like medium well as it was not very pink in the middle. I was pretty disappointed in the somewhat limp fries. They should come out more crisp. As a caloric  indulgence, I also got the Black & White milkshake. For $8, I really wish that there was more milk shake and less whipped cream! The glass is also very tall, skinny, and deceiving. You think you get a lot of milkshake, but you really don't. And there's no stainless steel cup with the overflow. Sad face.
I never seem to actually eat burgers here. Though, when I do, whichever burger I get is usually pretty good. I tend more towards appetizers, sides, drinks, and desserts here. One of my fav things about this spot is their great beer list. It's not crazy awesome, but it's pretty darn good. And you can create your own sampler of the different beers too. I'm also a fan of the trio of fries. Fair warning: It's an insane amount of fries - don't attempt to eat it on your own. You can get to pick 3 different types of fries (or rings). I really like the fat fries and sweet potato fries. And then you can pair that trio fries with a sampler of dipping sauces. Oh my! I do love me some dipping sauces, so I'm a total fan of this sampler. Every single sauce I've tried so far has been great. And then there's the adult milkshakes, beer floats, etc., etc. There's definitely a LOT more to the Burger Bar than just burgers.
Wow this place is pushing 1700 reviews? I'll throw my brief one in and watch it get lost among the rest then :). . I opted for the Hangover Burger simply because anytime I can get a burger topped with a runny over-easy egg I go for it! The burger was superb and the side of fries were decent and my plate cost around $14 which is to be expected at a joint right on the strip. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive as they could be while the place was pretty full. All in all, not a bad pit-stop after a concert at The House of Blues or perhaps a long night of shopping.. . Their dessert options looked quite intriguing however I have not yet gotten a chance to order off of that menu.
Great casual spot!. . Tons of burger choices, you can customize however you want. My boyfriend got the Rossini with Kobe beef, foie gras and truffles, then he added lobster. I was very apprehensive because I feel like a burger doesn't need all those additions but it was pretty good, he loved it. I got the sliders and got to try three different kinds of burgers, they were all great especially the Buffalo! The fry sampler is perfect because you can pick three sides to share. The sauces for the fries aren't that impressive so save your money for a shake! . . The flights of beer are super fun, you get a choice of six different kinds.
Wow! I never even knew this place existed and now I can't wait to go back. My amazing girlfriend brought me here on our recent Vegas getaway. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Yes I just said that. One of the best burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of them. I love cheeseburgers. I think I am ruined on burgers after this.. It is a nice place. One long bar with tables and some cool booths. I think it is great that they can text you now when your table is ready. No buzzer to carry around and if the wait is long you can wander farther away. It is a sign that this was the busiest place in this little area. There are a lot of other restaurants in this little area but this was the busiest. I now know why.. You can build your own burger and shake. Anything you want. Really anything. If you really go crazy you can get a $100 burger. You think that is crazy but I would say from the first bite you would say it was worth it. Mine came in about $20 and it was so good. From the first bite to the last. I didn't even get anything crazy. I just got an Angus patty, cooked medium, jalapeno bacon, Swiss cheese, a fried egg and their spicy ketchup. It is tempting to pile stuff on because you see so many toppings that you like but trust me 4 is enough. Too many and you have too many flavors going on and you overwhelm the burger. Mine was just about perfect. Cooked just right. It feel apart when you bit into it and melted in your mouth. The jalapeno bacon and the spicy ketchup had just the right amount of kick. Just what I was looking for.. For the shake I got chocolate ice cream with Oreos, hot fudge and mini marshmallows with whipped cream on top. The straw is huge. Almost hard to get your mouth around but big enough so nothing gets caught. It was so good too. Creamy and chocolaty. So good.. The service was great too. Water always full. They gave us time to pick out exactly what we wanted.. I really can't wait to go back. We almost went back a few times but wanted to try other places. Guaranteed when we come back to Vegas this will be one of our first stops. For sure.
Awesome food.Great Service. This place you pay to play in this sandbox. Worth every penny!
Oh man this place is good! Love to build my own burger with lobster on top!! The staff is very friendly and helpful when asking questions and the women workers here are HOT! Anyways i go with the spicy lamb burger which is a favorite, orion rings and shakes are just awesome I like this place a bit better the BLT burger at the Mirage due to a bigger menu and drink selection. When i think about a good burger in vegas i think Burger Bar!
Great beer selection, good service and one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.
Haven't been there in a couple years, but this place has great burgers and a good beer selection.
This place has amazing burgers and I love bringing out of town friends here.  To me it is the original gourmet burger restaurant in Las Vegas and still the best.
Very delicious! My boyfriend was able to try a Buffalo Burger and he was SUPER impressed, and wouldn't stop talking about it the rest of the night. My burger was a well done Angus Beef patty with aioli sauce and avocado. The fries were also amazing, and since we ordered the fry sampler, we even had fries to eat the next day!. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey, but since it was on the Strip I expected it. . I would definitely visit again. :-)
I was looking forward to checking this place out. The prices are decent and heard good things. So my expectations were high. While the burger was good it wasn't great, it didn't wow me by any means. The Burger spot inside New York New York is much better.
