I love random little places like these, they really surprise you sometimes. . . KoMex has some really good food- just pick anything off the menu, you won't be disappointed. Delicious & ADDICTING food, service with a smile, what more could you ask for?
KoMex is one of my favorite go to spots in town. The fusion nachos and fries are always a good choice. Last time I went I tried the fusion pork belly tacos and loved them. I don't think I've had anything here that I don't like.
We've been going here since it opened, never fails to disappoint, always fulfills that itch.. I want to have a relationship with the spicy pork. :drool
Food was pretty good . Service was excellent, parking was a bit of a hassle, but otherwise great place to try
I knew about, but hadn't tried the new Decatur location.  I knew all was well when the owner came out and said "Welcome back--we haven't seen you in almost 6 months.". . I went with the Bulgogi burrito and my son had the beef burrito.  excellent as usual.  What more is there to say other than that we will be back to try more of the fusion items....
Bulgogi nachos are amazing.  It's a Korean fusion restaurant, and they definitely did it right.  . . It's not fancy. It's in a small strip mall way off the Las Vegas strip. But if you're in town and willing to venture off the strip for some good eats, this is definitely a place I would recommend.  . . Service is sub par, but I didn't expect anything fancy from a tiny strip mall restaurant. The food didn't disappoint.
I checked out KoMex the other day.  I got the kim chi fried rice with chicken.  It was saucy and spicy and in a way...comforting.  It was nice to remove myself from the hustle from the Strip and sit down in a nice little hole in the wall restaurant.. . I also tried the burrito.  It basically was any other burrito that I would have gotten at a mexican restaurant, but with bulgogi.  I kind of wish there was a sauce to go with it though.. . The crew is really nice and attentive.
Great food might be an understatement, even better prices! Love Komex Fusion, only reason I gave it a 4star, is it could use some major scrubbing inside but if you are willing to look the cleanliness the rest is great.
Service and food quality at Decatur store has gone down since expansion/new store both time I have called since.  Can the owners come back please and show the new kid on the block your style of service and quality of cooking?  When I just told the new guy how I felt since the change, he said OK fine if I didn't come back.  He answered the phone at 8:25pm and told me they were closed even though the website say until 9pm for both stores.  Really your going to be there for a while still taking care of what sounded like a loud full restaurant and cleaning up why argue with me and loose a good customer that use to tell everybody how great this place WAS.  He said no, I am looking at the site on my phone and it says 8pm close, maybe he doesn't realize mobile sites can differ from main sites but regardless don't call me a liar when I can clearly see the posted hours on my computer.
After my first KoMex experience, I have driven out of my way many times to eat at this place. The food is that good! I recommend just about anything on the Fusion section of the menu. My favorites include the following: Bulgogi Cheesesteak, Fusion Burrito, and Fusion Tacos.. . The only food item I have disliked here is the Fusion Chimichanga. It was too greasy for my taste. I felt a bit nauseous. Other than that, everything else is gold.. . The new location on Buffalo is also much bigger than the Decatur location, but it seems understaffed. However, the food is just as delicious.. . Tip: Put kimchi on everything!. . The service is usually great, and I am happy to see this local family business succeeding. I highly recommend it.
Enjoyed lunch here on 01/15/14. Bulgogi fries were good, not sure what I was expecting. Wontons were awesomely delicious. Quick service when calling in an order. Next time I will dine in and I will definitely give them another try.
I came here after seeing Komex on multiple lists for foods to try in Vegas.  I don't see what the big deal is.... . I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!. . Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.  . . To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.. . Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.. . Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.. . But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entree failed to pass my taste test.. . My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK..... . As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae...
Korean and Mexican WHATTTT??? Wow there is something to be said about Fusion Food. We stopped at this place when a friend jumped on Yelp and saw the fab reviews.  It is in a strip mall with tight parking but so worth the extra effort and time.  So inexpensive especially in a town where I am always shocked at the cost of Mexican Food. I had the fusion tacos and they were delish!. . Love finding little gems like this.  It's a place worth driving to and checking out. You will not be disappointed. If you are picky on ambiance take it go.. . Geez this review is making me want to take a trip back to KoMex as we speak : ). . Did I mention just saw they opened another location on Flamingo/Buffalo woot woot!
When I heard of komex is was like whats that... After I ate   some food from Komex I was like OMG this is the best... I highly recommend eating there..  service is outstanding just like the food... Who would have thought Korean food mexican food mixed tasting so great together.... well its awesome and so delicious that im addicted to eating there on a weekly basis....
The Fries! Get the Fusion Fries!. . This place was a PERFECT blend of Mexican and Asian fare. The fusion dishes are really creative and they blend together in perfect Korean-Mexican fashion. The place is not fast food, it is very high-quality food, but you still won't wait long for your meal. I think it took less than 10 minutes for all our food to come out, and we ordered a lot.. . The fusion fries were my favorite, and a half order is big enough for probably 3-4 people. The pork lettuce wraps were a great appetizer, they had a little pico from the mexican side, and the meat was from the korean side. Another perfect blend. The bulgogi chimichanga was huge and delicious, and you definitely can't go wrong with this order.. . I was very happy with everything I ordered and really want to go back the next time I'm in town!
Omg! Omg! So delicious. I tried this place with my Co - workers and we all feel in deep love. Amazing. Every one have it.
Awesome kimchi on my Mexican.  It's hard to find good Mexican out here but found a place that uses a lot Mexican food with awesome pickled and spicy Korean flavor.  Super affordable.  Bring your stretchy sweat pants...
I was so excited to try this place.  I think maybe sometimes anticipation makes for a huge let down.  . I'm from LA.  I am Korean.  I live in Ktown.  I grew up on the best home cooked Korean food around (shout out to my Ma!). I also have access to the BEST Mexican food around.  LA has it going on.. . So maybe...just maybe...these things worked against me in this instance.. . I wasn't impressed with the Korean or the Mexican aspect of this place.  Neither really stood out.  I was thinking like Street taco style tacos with Korean spice.  . My mom pointed out that she and I could probably do better putting kimchee on street tacos in LA.  . . I tried the chicken, pork and bulgogi tacos, the kimchee fried rice with spam and Spam musubi with fried egg.  . -The tacos were just okay.  The meat in all three really could have been kicked up a notch.  They weren't memorable at all.  Not even the slaw on top had any flavor.  I had to drench with hot sauce (sauces are really good.  they come in a holder with 3 sauces) and tons of lime juice.  I do really like that you can get them with tortillas or in lettuce cups.  add a star for that. . -The kimchee fried rice was just too...mushy.  And the spam was chopped so fine and tiny that I couldn't taste it.  Either add more or don't cut them so tiny.  I want to taste the spam.  Why else would I order it?. -spam musubi with egg.  can't mess that up really.  . . Service was kind of slow.  We had to ask our server for stuff or just get up and get it ourselves.  A few times she just ignored us completely.  Whatever.. . I don't want to knock this place. I give them mad props for the creative aspect.  Another star for that.  They have a good following here.  I'm just saying...if you're used to really good Korean food and really authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place for you.
Ordered 2 items. . . Best thing to come out was the chips and salsa that were comp w the meal. Crispy and delicious but doable at home. . . Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice - very large serving. Fried in sesame oil which I like. Very good but not necessarily unique or hard to find. . . Pork belly Fusion Taco - Disappointing. . Pork belly = Meat and Fat. Hot pork belly fat is heaven on the roof of your mouth. After it cools and congeals a bit it heads south in taste and texture. That's how the fat part was in my taco. Had to spit out a few nuggets. . The meat part was like marinated jerky bits. Very chewy though flavorful.  . . Probably won't be back. Mainly because I'm from Hawaii and there are a lot of places I'd like to try in Vegas so you gotta hit hard on your first try for me to come back. . . Oh and there's nothing free w Yelp checkin.
