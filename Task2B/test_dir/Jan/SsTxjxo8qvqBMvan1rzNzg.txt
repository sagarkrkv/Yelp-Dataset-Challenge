Yummy. The food here is amazing it is the best for you can find in all lost Vegas the specially after a long night out and about and partying and drinking and having fun this is the place that we went to right after New Years Eve it was packed but it didn't matter great service they even include people coming by to provide pictures to provide more alcohol for those of you that are hungover and also provide other amenities that you don't normally find any other restaurant the onion is great the decorations are like from the 70's and 80's altra altra 80 ish I guess you could say um and go in the Fireside Lounge because you'll never believe how amazing it is and check out the shack carpet
way too much food, couldnt finish it all, pretty good, eggs were cold.
Great food, huge portions. . . I highly recommend this place for families, don't be scared to share! Your waistline will appreciate it.
There is so much character here, it's hard to focus!  There is one person seating you, another coming around for cocktails, a third for drinks and then there's your waitress.  What a system!  It's interesting to see it all.  We dined on New Year's day and while it was definitely crowded, we only had a few minute wait.  The food was delish!  My no-bread eating husband ate all of the toast and then mine. We ordered some omelets, which are made from 10 eggs by the way, and only ate about half of each although I wished I could eat more.  Overall, great vibe, great food and the prices weren't too bad either.  Worth the experience!
Forget what you heard. Yes, the decor is horrendous. Yes, the servers are dressed in severely dated threads. And yes, the wait can be long and cramped. It's all worth it once you sink your teeth intoone of the best hang over meals in Vegas.. . I had the tostada omelette and a huge mimosa. I also got to taste the chicken fried steak. Everything was delicious.. . The service is friendly and efficient. . . Just go!
Yep breakfast here like everyone else..good portions good service. .And a bit of a wait but worth it
If you want quality food and bang for your buck.... This is the place to go!!! Delicious breakfast food and a unique atmostphere. Fun place to go with friends and family
For the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at The Fireside Lounge for drinks and appetizers at Happy Hour.  This place is a Las Vegas icon.  Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.  . . To be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.  . . My drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:. . -Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.. . -Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!. . -Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.. . -Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!. . -Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.. . -Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!. . I know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.  Nothing that really blew me away.  I would go back because of the status of this historic icon.
It was off again to Peppermill for another great meal!. . This time I enjoyed a Spinach Salad with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy French-style Dressing (although Hot Bacon Dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine Gyros with soothing cool cucumber Tzaki Sauce, tomatoes, and White Onions.  The large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on Red Potato Salad.  . . Other guests in my party savored a Gourmet Chicken Salad, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, and Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, and crispy Hash Browns, along with an excellent warm Bran Muffin that I sampled.  The ambiance here is always upbeat, casual, and comfortable.  And service was very good.  My only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after I finished it.. . I will surely return another day for more fine comfort food!
I have to update my review - imagine my surprise, when after seeing a magic show with the kids at the Riviera, we passed the Peppermill. Wait a minute - I swear I have been here before. Maybe it's sad when you have to consult Yelp to figure out what you did about 3 years ago, but I did.. . This time, we were here with the kids, and we had a fantastic night - maybe the best night of our whole trip, because after feeding Thing 1 and Thing 2 a massive burger / pancake / french toast / whatever the hell they ate they insisted on having a dessert. . . " Too much food " we said " you'll never finish it ". . "OH YES WE WILL". . "Wanna bet?" Oh yeah baby.. . The largest banana splits I have ever seen in my life arrived - they must have had 5lbs of ice cream and four bananas apiece on them, there was no way the boys are going to finish them. They approached their task with grim determination. After a few minutes it was clear they were not enjoying themselves - this was work.. . " you're not allowed to stop - you have to finish them ". . " what sort of parents are you guys that you are making us eat this -this is force feeding, this is torture - you guys are completely irresponsible". . Jesus, I laughed so much. It was fantastic. Great service, great food, great value - and they had a Fog Cutter on the menu - it was a bit sweet, but it was decent enough.
The portions are large, but at $29 the ribeye was very fatty. The dinner salad was large, but why do so many places serve that gelatinous Italian dressing that may or may not have oil and vinegar in them?
Keep it simple with your order and be cool to the staff lol. . 3.5 for the fireplace but not nearly as nice as I remembered but sold place to get your late night or pre-game grub on.. . Heck I should just give them 5 stars cuz the fireplace closes the deal every time!!!! Luck be a lady tonight ;)
Everything you read in reviews for this restaurant is true. When you enter the restaurant you are seemingly transported back in time to an earlier Vegas. The service is outstanding, with separate waitresses for your food and cocktails. They mix a mean bloody mary! You better bring a huge appetite because the portions here are incredibly large and tasty.
A las vegas instution! This place defines las vegas. There something here for everyone. Drinks, good food, and a excellent atmosphere. They have a huge cocktail menu, with just about any drink you can think of. There fireside lounge is what they are known for, its a comfortable setting with purple velvet booths and big screen tvs. The menu is just as big serving classic diner comfort food. Great staff always friendly, and never had a bad meal here. The prices are very reasonable too, and you never leave hungry.
Amazing food - seafood is so fresh & all the food we ordered was delicious!! Wonderful service too! A must any time of day!!
It wasn't what I remembered when I last came here. The food was mediocre and the service wasn't great. It took awhile for my husband and I to get our food, considering the fact that there were 4 chefs in the kitchen. On top of that, they forgot one if our side orders. . . I was a bit disappointed this time around, and in pretty sure my husband washed his hands with the place. Too bad...
Open 24/7 - one of the most convenient places to eat by the strip. Love the atmosphere, food and service are great- mornings are packed so try to avoid!
Boy, did the Peppermill hit the spot! First off, walking in is as big and wonderful a trip as anyone who appreciates neon would describe it. It's kitschy Vegas at its best. The seating is arranged in these amorphous islands of booths, which makes us feel like we're all neon jellyfish in the middle of the ocean deep, and it's enchanting. . . The diner food is also as good as it gets. The three of us discovered that we are all "breakfast for dinner" people, and we freaking chowed down, sharing parts of our ginormous meals with each other but still managing to clean most of our plates.. . French Toast Collage - So good, and I'm so glad I got to share a couple of my squares so I didn't have to eat them all myself. Eggs, bacon, sausage, all perfect.. . Steak and Eggs - Very good, quality steak, sunny side up eggs, and I tried the wonderful toast and real strawberry jam also. . . Veggie Omelet - Well received. . . Definitely returning to the Peppermill!
Went to The Peppermill the other night for a date night meal. When we sat down the buser came and greeted us for drink orders. He was very friendly and funny. Then the waitress took our food orders. She told us the servings were big and she wasnt lying! Late night and we both ordered breakfast. Everything was amazing. My girlfriend in particular loved her hot chocolate and the already ready sprinkles that they have at every table! She always notices little things like that. After the meal, we paid and went next door to check out the firepit. It's in the bar and lounge area. We sat at the firepit and both had a drink, enjoying the warm fire and the good tunes playing. Looking forward to going back as this is now our favorite late night spot!. . -J. Soto
Don't judge this book by its outer cover.  Great breakfast, great service and the coolest lounge in the back for late night.  I wish I had discovered this years ago
In town for a convention and needed a non sports book place to watch a hockey game. Web and Yelp mentioned they had a comfortable bar so I decided to check it out.. . My bartenders Denise and Ruth were wonderful. The place was very busy but my drink was always full, they delivered my snacks, and were even able to help me charge my phone!!. . Since I was watching the game I stayed at the bar, but the lounge looks great and I will check it out next time I'm in town. There are comfortable booths and a great circular fire pit. The waitresses were also very friendly. . . The margaritas were good. Can't speak to the food because I only had chips and salsa, but the restaurant and waiting area were packed when I was leaving. Might not have the big chef name or be associated with a casino but it suited my needs perfectly.
Had a fun time at Peppermill. Servers were friendly,  decor was wonderfully cheesy,  the food was as better than expected. Well, dinner was better than expected. Dessert was disappointing. We shared a strawberry shortcake and it was underwhelming. They used  strawberry syrup like from McDonald's and a flavor less cake. I think it's because there are do many great places to get dessert in this town,  I'm surprised when something on the Strip disappoints. I would go back, the lounge and entrees are throwback classics. And we really enjoyed the server.  Just know there are better sweets all over this town.
Old school, big portions, ask for fresh jalepenos and if you want to see locals other than the staff, go in the middle of the night.
There were three of us together wanting to get some grub and right when we walk in we already knew their was going to be a wait; it was pretty packed - the receptionist said that it was going to be a 25-30 minute wait, which ended up to be 1.5 hours! I also noticed that she told that to every single customer that and they ended up waiting just as long as we did if not longer. The decor is different, unique. The waitresses were on point and it seemed like they all worked together. The food was pretty good - worth the wait, it was an awesome amount of food too! Besides the receptionist lying about the wait it ober all was a good experience. Also, a lady walks around and asks to take your pictures which was actually pretty nice rather than annoying because well you are trying to eat,  we ended up buying the pics too!
Classic. Old School Vegas Gem.. . Great food and service.  The Lounge by the fire is one of the best places to hang out and drink with your friends.  We spent "Super Bowl Saturday" here.  We relaxed in a big booth by the fire and enjoyed specialty cocktails way into the night.  Then went and rested up for the Big Game in 2004.  Fun times with good friends are where memories are made. 10 years later and I still remember the time..... .  Love this place~
We first came to the Fireside Lounge just before Halloween. I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would "treat you like big shots" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.. . Then we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.. . Now here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, "you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated." We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No "thank you for dining with us" or "have a nice holiday" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. . . I would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee.
Loved this place! It's open 24 hours and after a drive from Southern California was a welcomed treat. The vibe was very casual and low key.. My husband looked on yelp for a restaurant for us to go to late. Most hotel restaurants close at 10 or close to that. We were seated right away. We ordered a scorpion (6 shots are in this shareable drink) Our food arrived quickly. Portions were huge!!! We both ordered steaks. Amazing! . We will defiantly be back.
I liked this place a lot. Ate here late one night with my mom while we were visiting Vegas for her birthday. I had chicken soup and a BLT and I wish I had been hungrier because the sandwich was awesome. The soup was only okay, but the service was fine and the prices are good.. . I also tried a drink called the Ultimate Mudslide and it was fantastic. Highly recommended. It was like an alcoholic milkshake.
So their food isn't all that bad. However I ordered an omelet with no cow cheese (my allergies were acting up) and realized after a few bites they had put both goat and cow cheese on. There was some crazy stringy cheese action going on. I sent it back and the manager Martha brought it out 10 minutes later to point out how there was no stringy cheese. And of course tell me I was wrong because that's the best way to keep customers in their place. Obviously the stringy cheese quality goes away when it's cold!! Way to go Martha! A plus service!
The waffle with fruit was the best breakfast I had when I was on vacation in Vegas. My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries that were cooked to perfection. Might look like a strip club when you walk up to the place, but the food is delicious and well worth it.
They give you alot of food... and I don't blame them for trying to get it out the kitchen because its horrible.  The fried steak meal was bland. . It was like eating hospital food. The beef nachos are way over priced, the chips were old. I wouldn't recommend it.
Been here a few times now. Tried the Happy Hour Chicken Quesadilla and it wasn't that impressive. Green pepperswere located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their "girly" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town).
Love coming to the place. Open 24 hours and still awesome!! Friendly service, reasonably priced and great service!   I'm a huge fan of their breakfast options and they are usually very quick on service.To be open 24/7/365 is awesome!  . They do get very busy at times so depending on the time you may have a wait.
This restaurant has been here since I was a little girl. And it is excellent! Always has been! The breakfast is beyond compare! The wait was a little long, but well worth it.. . The eggs are made exactly how I like them...every time I am here!  The hash browns are perfection and bacon is crisp yet juicy!  . . Coffee...to die for!  I love the sugar-so whimsical!! . . It's hard to mess up breakfast food but it is perfect here,,,every time and with a packed house!
I go to Vegas maybe 4 times a year and always come here everytime. The drinks. Are good I have ordered steak , wings salad , soup everything. Is always good but it's become. More of a tradition to always go. To pepper mill I was recommend by a valet worker at the Cosmo after leaving the marquee night club I ask him what was open and he said pepper mill so I told the taxi and ever since then I'm always a regular when I'm in town lol
