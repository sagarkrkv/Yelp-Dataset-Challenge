Came here for the Ne-Yo event on NYE 2014. I have to laugh that people were verbally complaining about the event while the were still on the dance floor. When we were heading out a guy walked out yelling "Horrible, horrible" to everyone in earshot. It was...well, bad. We didn't see any sign of Ne-Yo until after midnight, and by then he was so f'ed up that everything he said and sang was just pathetic. For $100/guy and $50/girl, all they did was blow paper confetti at midnight. The entire experience lacked anything special. With that fat of a cover and no live music performance by your headliner, you should at least hand out some cheap champagne. . . 3 shots of well vodka and a vodka martini were $56. The entire club (which has multiple rooms of different styles of music and no real room to dance in any of them) has donated all possible space to VIP booths. Many of those are nowhere near the action, so you have to get up and leave, making your booth susceptible to theft. I don't recommend bottle service at this club. I'm glad we didn't go for it. If you aren't a VIP, however, good luck finding anywhere so much to even lean, as they've profit-maximized every square inch of the interior. . . Additionally, so many people were chain smoking within an area of so little ventilation that I became literally sick to my stomach and had to excuse myself from the club entirely. I'm pretty used to the nasty smoking liberty people in Vegas abuse, but this was a little overboard. . . Music was house/EDM samples, nothing Top 40 or dancey. Nothing unique to the DJ stack at all - you'll find these types of mixes anywhere. Pretty weak. Pro's of the club were the bouncers/security (who I found to actually be pretty accommodating), the cleanliness, and the multi-room concept. The decor also differed between the rooms, which was cool. . . Alllovelies aside, I don't see myself returning to this club.
Pure isn't.. . It's in Caesar's, and has a lot of gansta-looking staff protecting expensive bottle-service couches, whilst the DJ plays twerking music that's both not exciting, and isn't very danceable. It costs about $50 for a couple to get in, to start. There's a dress code, and I'm not sure what it is. I got in, as did my friend.. . The facility is quite beautiful, and there are two bars. Drinks are expensive+. Music? Nothing I enjoyed and the DJ kept the rhythms unprogressive. It was a waste of $$$$.. . Lots of wannabees and lounge lizard types hung out, watching as the twerkers did their thing. Women in club gear tried to look beautiful. A few couples actually seemed to be having fun. . . My suggestion: if you're a voyeur or wannabe, run, don't walk to get here. The restaya, there's better money spend.
For all the times we've been to Vegas, this is the first time we chose to get bottle service at a dance club.  This is most likely due to having it be a group of us rather than just Gregg and I.  . . Pure was where I chose to go to for the "pre-wedding" party; a combined bachelor/ bachelorette party.  Let me say - going VIP with a group is definitely the way to do this.  Otherwise, you wouldn't find me on the overcrowded dance floor, nor would you probably see me in the club at all.  So thank you Pure for the great time.  You may be asking why I gave it only 3 stars.  Everything about the night was great - from the escort to our table, to the drinks made on the spot.  There were only two dark spots - the starting DJ and the overpriced bottles (not unusual in a club, but IMHO more overpriced than other places).  The DJ seriously need to play a good song and let it play all the way out rather than only playing 30-45 seconds of it and then switching it.  It was a total bummer to be shaking my tail only to have the beat change so often  Thank goodness for DJ #2 who brought the energy level up and kept it up the whole time.  Unfortunately by the time he got there, it was almost time for us to leave (I didn't want to fall asleep during the wedding vows).. . Would I go to Pure again?  I'm not sure - perhaps with a large group again I would, but I would hope that they have a DJ that keeps the energy going all night (from the time they open to the time they close).  Otherwise I'm not sure if the price of the drinks there would be worth it.  For me, the whole point of a bottle service is to make sure you can dance, drink and have fun the whole night.  After all, if we aren't going to dance, we might as well go to a bar where we can hear each other talk.
I've had some very memorable experiences at Pure. The 3 times I've been there, we've usually ordered a bottle to avoid having to wait in 1-2 hour lines and also to ensure that we have a place to sit. During all three of these visits, the service was excellent; the security was friendly where it counted. Pure stood out as "The Gold Standard" of what a nightclub in Vegas should be. This is what brought the stars to 4.. . During my last visit (which wasn't bottle service) the experience just wasn't there. Obviously I wasn't expecting the same royal treatment you'd get with bottle service, but since I was in a smaller party we thought we'd base if bottle service was necessary on the vibe we got at entry. Long story short. We waited for a drink. Walked out.. . Pure- Get  your game up.
Well I was here last night. We reserved a VIP table. Service was good! We have been seated somewhere far from dance floor. But we agreed on one condition, they promised to seat us closer as soon as they get a chance. But they never did. The atmosphere was awfull. In other words, the class of Pure was dropped compared to 2-3 years before. No recommend and will never go again.  I've been told we can't smoke cigar, but people next table were smoking cigar.
Let me tell you my experience . The first time I went there Thursday January 23rd 2014 was with my bf . I was let in and it was fun . My bf paid 10$ because I guess we were at the guest list . The reason why I put 2 stars was because the drinks are ridiculously expensive but you know it's Vegas . A bottle of beer is 9$ or other mix drinks are 14$. The dance floor for me was really small even though you can dance anywhere and there are tables to hangout with . The bathroom was kept clean . The VIP tables takes all the space . There are 2 bars and the bartenders are very friendly (maybe for the tips) the ladies gets a free drink till 12am only with VODKA AND SOME SPRITE , coke (typical sodas) . I mean I heard other clubs gives away free drinks till 1am with more choices . . . THE SECOND TIME I WENT Was last night . I should have never came back. We were at the guest list line  until the bouncers checked my I.d. Saying that it wasn't me. Asking me about my middle name and when I graduate high school. The picture I had on my license was 4 FUCKING YEARS AGO , I look totally different PLUS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE DMVS OUT THERE THAT HAS POOR QUALITY CAMERA. The middle name I had in my license was my moms maiden name (I guess in my tradition you have to put your moms maiden name). Asking me how to spell it and I did correctly and they still wouldn't let me in. EVEN TRIED DOING MY OWN SIGNATURE .and asking me if I have other card that has my name on it(which of course they didn't look at) I'm not saying all this because I am mad about that I'm just saying that this club isn't worth it at all. . . IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CLUB TO GO ASK PEOPLE WHO LIVES THERE LONG ENOUGH .  . . MY ADVISE : make sure you look like your IDENTIFICATION . Have plenty of money to spend for drinks . I GUESS THE BOUNCERS ARE MORE STRICTER  THAN THE TSA AT THE AIRPORT .
I like the look of the club on the outside. Their host outside the ropes are cool and make sure if you have a table your not waiting long. Love the look of the club inside. Didn't like the music so much the DJ was all over the place. The bathroom is in the worst location you have to walk threw the dancefloor all the way in the corner. I would have to say it is a so-so club.
