3.5 stars!. I came here on NYE and waited for 30 minutes for a slice of white pizza for $5. The pizza was good. I prefer my pizza with thick crust, but the flavors were there. I think that $5 for a slice is a little high and the wait was too long, but it's Vegas on NYE so I understand.
Yay first review of 2014!!!. . I've been hearing a lot about this place, good and bad. I love pizza, so when a group of friends couldn't decide on what to eat, this place was the perfect spot.. . There's no signs, just an open door leading into a picture framed hallway. You look up at the simple menu. Immediately we noticed NO RANCH. Dang!! It's ok though. The pizza was still good without it. It's about $5 a slice for a plain cheese pizza, but with 5 of us, a couple dollars more per person got us a fresh whole pie. We opted for the white, which comes with mozzarella cheese and ricotta. It was quite tasty!!! A little but on the greasy side, but that's what happens when you order a pizza that's ALL cheese. . . It was a solid pizza spot, but for the pricing and the fact that there's hardly anywhere to sit, I'd still rather have Grimaldi's.. . P.S. This would be an awesome spot if I was drunk!
Cosmo, you're a freaking genius.. . What better way to attract all the drunkards but with a "secret" hidden pizza joint. Too bad it's really not a secret anymore. :(. . Anyways, secret pizza probably has saved me more than I realized. Especially on a drinking night, you gotta get that pizza fuel to get you through the night. What better way to end your night of drinking, dancing, clubbing but with some hot fresh pizza?!. . It's a better deal to just get a whole pizza. A 5 topping whole pizza come out to be around $35. For Cosmo standards, I think that's freaking worth it. Even if it's just for two people, just order a whole pizza, eat your couple of slices, then take the rest up to your room. And voila, you have breakfast the next day. The greatest thing about the Cosmo rooms is that they have microwaves inside the kitchen area so you can nuke your pizza the next morning for some hot breakfast or be like me and eat it cold. . . Also, if you get lazy and you'restaying in the Cosmo rooms, they also deliver. How awesome is that? . . Anyways, their pizzas are actually pretty tasty so it's a win win for all!
OMG why did I have so much trouble finding this place!? It was like trying to find Platform 9 and 3/4. Got directions from 3 different employees working at the Cosmopolitan too. Blame it on the A-A-A-Alcohol! No, but the Fat Tuesday probably had something to do with it. My brother and I got here eventually. It's a tiny hallway in between two bigger restaurant (can't remember the names). The hallway is filled with pictures frames of old school favorites like Frank Sinatra and J. Travolta. Don't forget to capture a few photos in this Hallway of Fame. . . Pizza pizza pizza! Lightly crisped with a constant chewy texture after. Get the white cheese! That's all I can say. Didn't realize how fast I ate that slice. I love me a good slice of pizza, and now I have a pizzeria to go to in Vegas if I'm ever having a pizza craving.
Okay this place is pretty good but it's obviously not a secret anymore -_-. . The White Pizza or whatever is suuuper good. I love cheese and creamy pizza :3 yummyyy.. . . But I have one freaking problem... THEY. DON'T. HAVE. RANCH. -____-. . i love my pizza crust with ranch and I was sho sad. They literally have it on their menu board. . NO RANCH. . . :( sadness. . . But their sodas is unlimited refills FYI
Went here with a group of friends since ice skating was not going to happen that night. What a secret it is with no sign above the entrance. . This is a place to order and then head out. Only a small counter to sit at. This place gets packed. No room to stand/sit while waiting for your order. Pizza by the slice or get an entire pie- your choice. Beer options are very limited. I appreciated the complimentary water.
Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  . . Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! . . Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat). with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. . . Happy Eats!
Located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo, you will find a long, dark hallway covered with old schooled vinyl records that will lead you to the secret pizza joint! One of my favorites. You can order by the slice, which is $5/pop, or what I usually do is order the whole pizza back to the room to eat. It's definitely worth it even if there's only 2 people because you can always microwave it for another time! Be sure to call and place your take-out order about 40 minutes in advance to avoid any lines! They have an assorted variety to choose from, but my favorite is their white pizza, which is filled with garlic, cheese, and olive oil. Perfect after a long night of drunken fun!
Pizza is really as good as it gets in Vegas.  However it is really pricey.  $5.00 a slice and $25.00 for a large cheese is the most expensive pizza I've ever seen.
Got their burger and wings no flavor what's so ever. Huge disappointment. One star cause service was ok.
We had ended our night at XS and wanted to try Secret Pizza, so we made the drive and weren't amazed. The line is long but it moves rather quickly.. . The others got pepperoni and sausage & pepperoncini, both just ok. I got the white pizza, flavors were delicious. Sadly, they don't reheat the slices, so ours were cold and our cheese hardened.. . Perfect for a night after Marquee, but wasn't worth the drive for us.
You know the drill.. . Go to Marquee.  Get drunk and have a good time.  Leave early enough to grab a slice from Secret Pizza right next door.  Honestly I never remember what I get here, but it's always good and not just because I'm drunk half the time.  There's usually a line especially at these odd hours, but the line moves pretty fast and it's oh so worth it.  This is one of my top 2 post-club foods right up there with Steak & Eggs at Tuscany's.
I have dreams about this place.
Secret Pizza definitely hits the right spot... especially if you are drunk/tipsy/buzzed from a night at Marquee.  I would leave clubbing early to beat the 2am long line, but I'm a fatty.  Even if you want to just fall asleep and go home, this pizza is worth the extra 30 min out.  Just go upstairs to the third floor and find the tiny little alley with drunk people leaning on the wall in line.  The white pizza is amazeballs and always ask for it even if you don't see it.  Sometimes they have a pizza waiting under the table!  Shhhh!  Secret pizza...
Came here after club hopping, and I truly thought it would be just a normal eh ok pizza but boy was I wrong! Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had! I got a slice of the veggie and man everything from the sauce to the crust was perfect !!! Def. Coming here again  when in town. Also the name of this place is truly fitting.
I bet you'll know at least one person who knows where this place is! You go through a hallway and enter this magical little place cooking up delicious pizza. You start with a base slice and you can add as many toppings as you want (you pay per topping). They kinda just pile everything on there, so dont get too carried away or it will be difficult to eat. Also, don't be fooled by the selection they have on the counter, because they have a lot more under the table! . . Crispy, hot, and delicious mmmm. While it's a bit steep at $5, I'd still come back here! . We went around 2 or 3 on a Saturday and there was no wait. WOO! but I hear the line can get pretty long
So at 1:00 am - your hungry... Where do you go? This place!! The pizza was hot , fresh, and delicious!
I LOVE SECRET PIZZAAAAA !! . . Being a Californian there's not a lot of pizza joints that  satisfy my needs when it comes to pie. Secret pizza hits the spot, being the foodie that I am it's totally worth the 4 hour drive down to Vegas ( YES, IT'S THAT AWESOME ) and order a box of pie from here. I recommend pepperoni ( can't go wrong with that right? ) and the white pizza, the pepperoni slices are SOOOOOOO good, its unlike what I tasted before, I feel like I haven't had true pepperoni untilthat day I had it here at Secret Pizza. And the white pie... Oh my god. I've never had white pie before and I'm glad I lost my white pie virginity here LOL, sprinkle on some red pepper flakes and your slice is solid. . This was all i ate on a 3 day trip to Vegas while staying at the Cosmo, every day... I just wished they delivered :(. . The second time I came here wasn't as flavor packed as the first but I still love it anyway :). . As far as ordering goes, I would definitely call in and order ahead of time if you're planning on getting a fresh whole box of pizza. YUM. If not they have a selection of pizzas by the slice you can choose from and they reheat it in their oven for a couple of minutes for you so it's nice and hot for ya. You can even watch them make pizza I front of your own eyes if you get bored waiting, I find it pretty entertaining. The guys that work here are nice and I'm glad that they are, it just makes the pizza here taste even better.
For any drunk club-goer in the wee hours of the night, this place is a dream come true. I went to Vegas for work recently and arrived to the hotel at midnight after many delays and hadn't eaten dinner. I was able to run downstairs and get a piece of pizza in 15 minutes. This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.. . I got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you're at the club and have found "someone special", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you'll have garlic breath for the rest of the night. The white pizza was great, and I was sober and hungry, so I'm sure if you're inebriated, it will taste even more delicious. . . I came back the next day after going out and drinking a lot and got the Supreme pizza. It was good, but not as good as the White pizza.. . Great for a late night slice of pizza after drinking, or when you need a quick bite to eat. They have a cooler of free water & cups so you can hydrate after a long night out.
Damn good pizza, tucked away inside the Cosmo. My usual go-to spot back when they were doing the free shows inside Book & Stage.
Cheap! Fast! Amazingly delicious! What more can you ask for?! This place is perfection! I love the white pizza the most and of course good 'ol pepperoni pizza. They even have Sicilian pizza which is yummy! They tend to have long lines at night so I normally go for lunch and its faster. . . Love this place and its now my go to place when I go to Vegas. Its a must! The closes thing to real NY pizza on the west coast.
$5 a slice!. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g#X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g. . Sure them be some damn good slices of NY style pie, but damn Gina, even in Vegas $5 felt a bit steep for cheese and bread. Just know that if you go on any busy night, it will be a long wait in a long hallway. Bring some drinks or something to kill the time. . . If the line is out of the hall, expect to wait almost an hour for above average $5 a slice pizza.
Holy Smokes!. . I will start by saying that this place has the BEST pizza I have eaten in a while, (next to chicago deep dish in chicago) but this place is DELICIOUS!. . I had to wait about 30 min for the line, and I ordered a full pie and normally it takes 25 min but they messed up a few times and ended up waiting 45 min. I was extremely hungry but it's understandable that sometimes people make mistakes. The worker did give us a free 2 liter bottle for making us wait extra. . . I got the normal Cheese pizza, size of this thing is HUGE. It was 25 bucks even split between 6 people which was less than 5 bucks a person! Definitely a good price for something in Vegas. . I woke up wanting more of this deliciousness. will most definitely come back again and try calling in my order next time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
There's not really much to say because I can sum it up in 4 words. . THE BEST PIZZA EVER!. Done! . A must try Go NoW!
I wouldn't say this place is cheap.... But their pepperoni is soooo good. but they were a little stinchy on their sauce though.  Not the best pizza I ever had but it's pretty good.  Maybe it was just over hyped for me.  . . 4 stars - Chances are I'm coming back.
This place is actually pretty good even though when we first saw the pizza we thought it wasn't gonna be good lolol anyways we went there late night n not line! GOOD! n I order the meat lover n the white cheese pizza n there are both surprisingly good!! especially the white cheese pizza! this place is really cheap n probably get a lot of ppll here after clubbing cuz it right next to the marquee exit lol plus cool door way tot eh place too hahah
Pizza was Hot & Fresh. I love when the cheese stretches after you bite it. That's how you know its real ;) I love the concept of the location. You have to FIND IT!!! Cashier was talking too damn much and caused a long dredding unnecessary line!! Serve the pizza, crack a joke a move on!!!!! Two slices cost around $15 with no drinks.  You get what you pay for !!!! Sooo good!!!! I will return!!!!
Awesome tasty thin crust pizza. Ask for pepperoncini peppers. Not much seating and a bit hard to find. On the 3rd floor in a narrow alley behind the pool table.
Delicious pizza! If you are tired of getting Earl's for a quick but yummy bite, head over to Secret Pizza. The slices are large, hot, and filling. I must have eaten here three times in one day when I was in Vegas.. . Got the sausage with peppers, cheese, and margherita. All of them were yummy but when I had the sausage with peppers one cold later that night, it was extremely salty so not sure what was going on there.
$30 for a whole white pizza. It's not cheap but what would you expect on lv strip unless you are getting fastfood? . . I had the white pizza to go and it was pretty good but not the best I have had. Next time, I'll just get a few slices of different flavors.. . The place is a bit tricky to find. It is located 3rd floor cosmo right off the escalator and right nexg to the steak place. You will have to literally just go in the hallway that looks like it is leading you to a game room.
Felt like I just grabbed a slice on the boardwalk. Yelp reviewers are right on with this spot. A tiny place tucked away on the third floor of the cosmopolitan. I'm not a huge pizza gal because I don't like a lot of bread and red sauce so this spot maybe me very happy. Crispy thin crust and the offer white slices. Great oil and garlic flavor. Two slices were too much but who knows when I'll be able to have a great slice like this again.  Perfect for lunch and in assuming amazing after drinking.
My friends and I hit up Secret Pizza on our last trip to Vegas, and it surely didn't disappoint!. We had heard so much about it from friends, and on our last night out we stopped by around 2 am for a slice. The line wasn't real long when we got there, but it was out past the hallway by the time we left!. The whole experience is pretty awesome. You can't smell the pizza outside of the hallway, and there is no sign, so it feels like you've made a quirky little discovery when you pop in.. I am a pizza purist, so I stuck with a regular pepperoni. It wasn't the best pizza I've had, but it was pretty great! Not too much cheese or sauce, and it was so hot and fresh. We waited a couple minutes for a fresh pizza because they had just run out of the pepperoni, and it was so worth it.. I definitely recommend Secret Pizza to anyone, whether you're looking for a bite after walking the strip, or you've got the munchies after a few hours of partying. It's cheap, fast, and delish!
I've been to Secret Pizza twice now (most recently this past weekend) and I give it an average rating only because of the quality of the pizza. Granted, it is a great place eat at 2 am when you're wasted and hanging out at the Cosmo. I felt like the price paid ($5/slice) for the portion size given was unacceptable.  I know it's Vegas, but you can get a slice twice the size for $3-4 in New York City a.k.a. The mecca of pizza. They also didn't have much variety this time.  I had a sliced sausage and pepperoni pizza which skimped on the sauce and the crust was too chewy.    . . We waited about 30 minutes in the line which we didn't mind so much, but it's kind of a letdown when you're overcharged and don't feel completely satisfied at the end. It's still decent drunk food, but I would never consider going there in any other circumstance. . . Being from Texas, I didn't really understand the whole "No Ranch" thing.  It's just ranch dressing.  Its not that expensive, you could probably charge a small amount for it and still profit and make tons more customers happy (This is for all of us in TX and the Midwest who require ranch dressing).. . Next time you're in Vegas and it's late and you're drunk and hungry, consider Secret Pizza for a fix, but realize there are other options that are just as, if not more appealing (Hash House a go go, Earl of Sandwich, etc).
Secret no more! :O. . After a long night of dancing the night away in KILLER heels you can't help but want to eat some delicious comfort food, and what better place to get it than from a place that calls itself Secret Pizza, everyone loves a good secret ;) If you didn't know about this place before hand, you would probably miss it, and it sure isn't a place to miss! But once you walk down that infamous hall way of frames on frames on frames into this lovely secret spot and smell the lovely aroma of yummy thin crust pizza you'll surely be happy to have found this hidden gem. . . My GO TO dish of course is everything! Order any kind of pizza and your taste buds will be happy little campers. I personally like to keep things simple and stick to the mushroom pizza, so delicious! With a few drinks in me, I could probably eat a whole box of pizza from here easily :P. . Try to beat the clubs closing or you will have to wait in a long line for your yummy goodies along side of a bunch of drunk barefoot ladies! X.X. . Happy eats, loves! ^_^
Pretty good pizza-- however, it's definitely not a secret anymore as the line was out the door at 4 am. Get the white pizza, it's as good as everyone says. At $5 a slice, it's not cheap for pizza but it's pretty decent for Vegas. Perfect place to go grab a late night bite after dancing all night at Marquee.
Came here based on a recommendation from a friend. I dont know how else people go here besides that because it is so hard to find! It was hard finding it even though we knew what we were looking for. There are no signs to get to the restaurant, but we were able to ask someone that worked there and we were pointed in the right direction. . . Its a really neat place. Cool pinball machines and records on the walls and they serve their beer in red solo cups. There is not a lot of room to eat, but if you take it to go and eat it your hotel room that works for larger parties. My favorite pie is the white pie! Its amazing and a gem on the strip!
My friends led me here and I didn't even know this place existed next to Marquee. I came here pretty sober so I didn't actually find the pizza place to be all that tasty although I could imagine how amazing it would taste as drunk food. . . It was $5 pizza per slice and only $25 for a pie so we tried to order one. They told us it would take 20 minutes and we were strapped for time so we ended up just ordering 4 slices of pizza. Next time, I'll be sure to place an advance order for the pie.
Secret Pizza lives up to its name. It has no sign and I have no idea how I found myself to this restaurant.. . Each slice is about $5 and the slices are decently large. I thought this was pretty expensive. The pizza is just normal pizza to me as nothing was really special about its construction or toppings. I thought that the slices were very flimsy and it would have been better to eat it with a knife and fork.. . There are not many seats for this place so prepare to stand and eat (there is nowhere outside either).
The name says it all since it took me about half an hour to find it. Yes being 3am and having a few of drinks didn't help my hunt but if you blink you miss the narrow hallway entrance. . There was a line but it moved quickly and finally it was my turn to order, I place my order quickly since I was starving. Once I got my two slices i went outside since  there was no place to sit and I was in pizza heaven. This pizza was the perfect combination of sauce, cheese and crispy crust.
So disappointed with this pizza!  I was looking forward to trying this place for the longgggesssstttt time!  It took me my 11th time to Vegas since I turned 21 to finally find this place (or at least really make an effort to go) and was so let down!  I'm generally not a fan of pizza but I can enjoy a slice every now and then.  When I got  that slice of the White Pizza (that everyone raves about), I wasn't impressed at all for the $5 that I just spent.  I love garlic and I love white sauce and I don't mind ricotta cheese, but it was just something about it that slice of pizza that was not my thing... the slice didn't even seem fresh and was barely warm.  :c. . It definitely wasn't amazing pizza sober.  I dunno about all y'all drunchies but maybe I'll give Secret Pizza another try the next time I come.  Just super disappointed that I hyped this place up anticipating that this place was going to be good, only to be let down..
Secret Pizza, you sneaky little devil. This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their "secret" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.. . After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!. . Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.. . Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, "Did you just see that?" while one other patron yelled out "Does that get you free toppings?" Hahah, we all laughed.. . Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :). . So my verdict?. . Worth the wait? Unfortunately yes.. Will I come back? Oh you betcha'. Will I save pizza for the next morning? No, it's definitely better hot... unless you have access to a microwave!
Nope not a fan of this place! Pizza was OK but for sure not worth the price! I wouldn't venture back here anytime soon. This place is at the cosmo hotel and casino 3rd floor.  Lucky i didn't have to wait in long lines. I ate half of the pizza and the rest in the trash..
Hit up some pizza after marquee.. . Dare you to find something better after leaving marquee within 2 min.. . Perfect spot with great pizza.. . Celebrate life.
I honestly think this is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas. I mean I don't go out of my way to come here because driving on the strip is a bi...atch, but if I happen to be at Cosmo I will do ANYTHING within my power to stop by Secret Pizza. . . Their white pizza is the definite winner. The gobs of different cheeses that they use are just too delicious. Pepperoni and sausage is a close second! They use thick slices of sausage that just complement the rich tomato sauce perfectly. Their crust is chewy and crispy at the same damn time. . . If you come here you have to order an entire pizza regardless of how many people are in your party. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza! Just be careful to wait a second so you don't burn the roof of your mouth. . . Now excuse me while I go reheat a leftover slice of white pizza in my kitchen.
Tomcat: What do you want for dessert? . . Pizza Cat: Pizzzzzah! . . Tomcat: We just had dinner. . . Pizza Cat: Yes, but we didn't have pizzzzzah! . . So. that sums it up. +1500 reviews, there's nothing that Pizza Cat can say that someone else hasn't said. Pizza Cat says it's a great 'za. She liked the combo pizza the best, even better than the pepperoni pizza. It was so good, she finished the combo pizza it its entirety, even after eating half the pepp slice AND eating a full dinner. . . Only negative is Pizza Cat was annoyed at the mess, especially since they were paying outrageous prices for slices of pizza. She gets it, it's suppose to be a NY-style pizzeria, but it doesn't have to be that authentic! Clean tables and clean condiments would be nice.
First off, thank you to everyone on Yelp giving directions to this "secret" spot - my brother made it sound very mysterious, so when visiting Cosmopolitan while walking the Strip, I told everyone we had to check it out. We lucked out going around 3pm with barely a wait (I'm sure late night it is crackin'). It's a cool concept, I'll give them that. The fact that there is no signage and the corridor is only marked with records makes you think you are going down a hallway to a restroom or back alley. But the blaring music and everyone outside standing around eating pizza slices makes it a dead giveaway. . . For its prices, it's decent pizza. They have a handful of slices to choose from, so I went with my typical white pizza - how I wish they put spinach or another type of green on top! My friend's husband got one with meatball topping and my boyfriend got traditional pepperoni. Our slices were warmed up quickly (my boyfriend lucked out with a fresh slice) and we grabbed our drinks and sat outside the pizza place near the pool table. . . Crunchy thin crust covered with decent toppings and lots of cheesy goodness - it's hard to go wrong. But I've had great pizza slices all over New York and San Diego, so I can't say its the best pizza I've ever had. I would love to give it more stars, but with all the pizza places that serve slices late night around Vegas (the one in Aria is just as delicious), Secret Pizza has some competition.
It's a secret. It's pizza, and it's good. That is all.
Secret pizza place...not much of a secret anymore! Especially when you make your way there after going to the club in the wee hours of the morning and there is a line that looks so intimidating that you want to turn back. Then someone walks by with their fresh from the oven slice and you decide to wait it out..this place is worth the wait for sure!
Had to get directions twice to find my way there and still have no idea how to get to this place. But the pizza was awesome and cheap. Probably more awesome at 2am.
S.S.A.P =  Secret Soggy Ass Pizza.  Albeit the ingredients were all fresh and great quality the execution of the pizza fell apart...literally.  The crust could not support the fats from the cheese and meats which made the crust completely marry in with the cheese to create this flimsy, greasy slice.  I understand that who makes the pizza makes the difference in the outcome so maybe the cooks had an off day.  I went in at around 1 pm on Saturday on 1/25/2014 and had the white pizza and meat lovers.  There was no line but was told by some that the line is usually off the hook.  There is so much more to experience foodie wise in Vegas, especially off the strip.  If you are looking for a cheap eat in a pizza form Bonnanos on the strip does the job and a much better tasting slice or if you want similar to east coast style pizza  Grimaldis at the Venetian is amazing...pricey but worth it.  Foodies leave this place behind to the drunkards coming off that club high and let the grease soaks up all their sins cuz lord knows this place has enough greasy pizza to purify everyone in Vegas!
Amazing!!! First of all, I loved the idea of it being this little hidden gem. This is why it was on our scavenger hunt created for my 30th. The pizza was delicious but the service (particularly of Ray the pizza chef) was outstanding. Such a nice guy that was so fun  and really went out of his way to help us with our scavenger hunt. I would stay at Cosmo next time just to have this pizza place steps away. :)
