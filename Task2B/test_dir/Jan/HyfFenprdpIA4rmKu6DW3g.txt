Cook on day-time is super surly.  Steamed clams was recommended but was disappointed as there was a flavorless broth.  Had to add salt! Hardly any herbs, little butter, and over-all, tasted like a tiny bit of clam base straight out of a jar from Smart and Final mixed with a little water.  Also over priced, wait was horrendous and walked out smelling like an ash tray.  But the beer was nice and cold and the bread did not disappoint.
Seriously Am I missing something here? . . After reading these incredible reviews we came here at 3am, waited about 30 minutes in line even at that time. We overheard the customers in front saying they had waited 2 hours in line before. . . So you think hearing that you are in for a transcending, mind blowing almost hallucinating experience from the pleasure of what you are eagerly awaiting for right? . . Nope. The oysters were orange in color, suspicious flavor and one of them was bubbling. The worst oysters I ever had. We felt queasy after. . . We also watched the cook use frozen seafood to make all the other dishes as we sat around the bar.
This place has hundreds of reviews so I can't imagine what I have to say that is different, so I will just say this: the wait time to get a seat is ridiculous. I was thinking to myself that this food better be phenomenal in order to justify the wait. And you know what? It was. I got the jumbo pan roast (shrimp, crab, lobster), and the wife got the crab pan roast. Both were extraordinary. So, check out this place, but be ready to stand in line a long time. In the end the wait is well worth the patience. I would return in a heartbeat.
When visiting Vegas make sure you stop by Palace station and visit the Oyster Bar the best pan roast in town!!!!
This is A MUST when visiting Vegas.  I always try to have at least one meal here when I go to Vegas.  It's off the strip but well worth the drive or taxi.  . . I almost always order the Pan Roast with sausage.  It's the best!  It has seafood for seafood lovers and also for those that don't like seafood, you can get chicken and or sausage.  The sauce is creamy and buttery.  I'm not sure how much cream or butter they put in it, but they make each bowl fresh.  It's cooked in the steam kettle that takes about 20-30 mins to make.  It's worth the long wait, even 2 hours when I go at peak time.  I think there are only 11 seats so I wouldn't recommend for a large group.  . . Go at odd times to eliminate the long wait and small groups are recommended.  . . I usually like the smaller oysters but theirs were pretty large but were very fresh.  If you're not a huge fan of large raw oysters, don't get them, save your stomach for the pan roast. . . Their portions are pretty big so sharing is a good option or left overs for the next day is always good. They will happily pack it up for you and even give you another bowl of rice.  . . Service is pretty good so I'll always return for my pan roast.
First time to the Oyster Bar. Was looking for an oyster place to try out in Las Vegas and this place had the most reviews. They have only one type of oyster. I forgot where the origin is from. It tasted alright. It was juicy but didn't taste as good as what I had from Seafood and Company and Neptune Oysters in Boston. It had a clean taste. I was expecting a lot since this place is an osyter bar and had a lot of good reviews. However,  I highly recommend the New England calm chowder. Very tasty and don't forget to add the tobacco sauce to the soup. This place is opened 24/7. The only drawback is that is has limited seating and it is bar style seating arrangements so it may take awhile to get seated.
This is a must when visiting Vegas! The place is small and has about 16 seatings so be prepare for a wait! The food will make it worth it though. We usually go around 4am after we leave the clubs, but even then we sometimes have to wait around 20 minutes.. . The server/waitress and chef are always friendly and attentive. I especially like how the chef is able to make all the food in front of us while still carrying fun conversations with everyone at the bar! They seem to remember their regulars as well.. . Their pan roast is a must get. It is a creamy blend of different seafood flavors. If you can handle spicy, get a level of 5 or more. I didn't taste any with 5 so next time I will up it! Their clam chowder is also amazing. What stood out the most for me are their oysters!!! They are big, fresh, and so juicy!! I have to come here at least once every time I make a trip to Vegas.
I was a pan-roast virgin prior to coming here and our friends insisted we make the trek from our hotel at 11pm at night.  The line wasn't bad at all, we were 3rd in line but the total wait from beginning until we got our food was probably 2 hours but it was sooo worth it!!! When I took my first spoonful of the house pan-roast with lobster added, it was basically an orgasm in my mouth.  I was in foodie heaven!  . . And, big shout out to chef Holloman!  The dude is hilarious, clearly loves what he does, and is great entertainment for all of us!  We came back the following night cause we were hooked and he wasn't there and it just wasn't the same.  . . Anyway, my mouth is watering just thinking of this place.  . . We tried a similar place afterwards in LA that claims to have stolen the chef from Oyster Bar but it was NOT the same.  This will be an obligatory stop every time we come to Las Vegas!
The wait was 3 hours for 4 people. Finally we sat down and this was the experience:. . Ordered the clam chowder, crab salad, dozen oysters and lobster pan roast. The food was excellent and very flavorful...I give that 5 stars. . . Now the customer service was not as good. I don't know the chefs name who cooked our food, but our server was Chrystina. Now, she works very hard but can have an attitude. She was talking bad about the couple who had just left before us, which is unprofessional. She rolled her eyes and had an attitude when I asked for a second order of bread...I was starving after waiting for 3 hours! Also, she and the chef who came in for the next shift we're arguing and going back and forth. I did not wait 3 hours to have to experience this...I watch enough of the Real Housewives series to get all the drama I need. I don't need it while my family and I dine. . . To summarize, I give the food 5 stars and the customer service a 2.5.
This is one of those places that is a must before leaving Vegas. The palace pan roast appears to be the most popular and is the only item I get whenever I get a chance to dine here. Maybe next time I'll be brave and try something new. It's just an open bartop with bar stools that only seats enough for about 12 people. So for the rest of the people...ya gotta wait in line! That's the worst part when you're already hungry you not only have to wait in line, but you get watch others before you feast upon all that delicious goodness! Their clam chowder is also very tasty and is a great starter before your meal. But definitely get the palace pan roast!! Don't leave Vegas without it!
When people tell you that a restaurant is more than about food and that it's also about experience...well let me tell you there's a lot of truth to that. The service is good, the chefs are funny, and the food isn't bad. The Oyster Bar is good, but I really can't see myself going back or consistently placing it in the top five of Yelp due to a couple things out of their control.. . The food was good. I had the clam chowder, combo pan roast, and seafood jambalaya. The server told me I was able to get a 2nd entree because there was no line at the moment. So I guess yay for my inner fat kid. The clam chowder was good, the oven pan roast was also good. A lot creamier than I had expected, almost like a tomato cream based tom kha gai from a Thai restaurant. The jambalaya was actually really good, some people at the bar were complaining that the gumbo was too salty so I went with this instead and it had a nice level of spice, not salty, and good meat. Honestly, it was good and I enjoyed it but I don't think I would ever be out with a group of friends and think "Hey let's go to the Oyster Bar." But it's still worth a decent amount of stars.. . Where it loses stars is its size as noted from prior posts. It seats 16, has only 6 of those seafood pots and these dishes take some time to make. The server said I was lucky and got there with no line and that it's an average of 45 - 90 minute wait. A wait isn't a big deal if the food is worth it, but the food isn't so knock your socks off amazing that you can't find something comparable if not better within a 10 mile radius of Palace Station. . . For the time I was there (during the day), I saw a guy box out [basketball term not boxing punch] a random woman who almost fell to the floor for one seat, a random guy mouthing off to the chef for no reason and should've gotten hot soup thrown on him, a grandma almost bitch slap this meth head for grabbing her bread, and a drunk with a sweet ass Stardust shirt fall asleep face first into his clam chowder....I almost needed the Heimlich because I was trying not to laugh so hard I almost choked. Serves me right I guess. Then the lady next to me, turned to me and said "this is nothing wait until dinner time it gets worse, there are actually yelling matches and fights out here." Now maybe she could've been exaggerating but it already just seemed like too much weirdness. All in all it was still good though. If I happened to be at the Palace Station I'd eat there again but I don't think I'd put in the effort to come back...food wise...people watching wise I'm all in!
Yes you may have to wait during the rush, but it is well worth the wait.  I've never had a bad meal here. Hubby and I like to come during the off hours, (2am) because there usually is no line.. . The pan roasts are excellent and the service is great. It's fun watching 2-3 people create yummy seafood greatness in such a small area. It is like watching a well choreographed dance at times.. . The late night oyster specials are a good deal too!
What can I say?  I like this place a lot and their pan-fried is the best!. . There is usually a long wait here (sometimes over an hour to 1.5 hours) but let me tell you its worth the wait.. . The soup portions are so big, I usually just share with my wife while we eat oysters.. . I notice a lot of regulars come here which says a lot about this restaurant and its great food/customer service.. . Highly highly recommend the pan fried.  I also like the Jumbalaya but to me its all about the pan fried.. . Its spicy so i would recommend getting something under medium if you can't handle spice well... or order something else.. . They also have beer specials for cheap after 1am.
Good food, friendly banter - what's not to like?  The place is tiny and sometimes the wait could be long, but it's one of the few restaurants in Vegas that would survive in other cities.  . . You sit at the bar with like 20 seats total.  The food is freshly prepared before your eyes.  The crowd is a pretty interesting, I saw one women take a nap in the middle of her meal.  . . I tried the lobster pan roast, house gumbo, oysters, and clams.  Everything was pretty darn good and portions are very generous - so be careful not to over order like we did ! .
As someone who doesn't like to wait in a long line for food, I have to admit, I'm willing to wait the hour or two for this place. The wait depends on when you come here. If you think coming late at night will help you avoid the crowd, think again! Odd hours like early morning or mid afternoon are actually your best bet. There is a higher chance of a huge crowd around late night or after clubbing. . . Service here is fantastic. Everyone is chatty and friendly. It's definitely a cozy bar with about 18 seats. It's probably best to come here in groups of 2-4 and not a huge group. The seating arrangements will make it extremely difficult to have your party seated together and at the same time. But everyone is friendly and will try to make room for your large group so you can try your luck.   . . As for the food: . . Oysters by the dozen - One of the best oysters I've ever had. It's a pretty platter of 12 oysters with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and slices of lemon. Most of the time, very fresh. They chuck them on the spot. There was one time that it was not very fresh when I came around winter time. Other than that one occasion, most of the time, it's absolutely delicious. . . Pan Roast Comb- Hands down my absolute favorite! Highly recommended. It's a great combination of cream, tomato, butter, and brandy with generous amount of shrimp, crab, and lobster. Also comes with a scoop of rice.  It's delicious and creamy, with a nice kick of spice. It's been the favorite amongst those I take to eat here. . . Bouillabaisse - Broth with generous amount of shrimp, crab leg, lobster, mussels and clams. It's pretty good, but not as good as the pan roast in my opinion. . . House Gumbo- I personally don't recommend it. It's a combination of shrimp, crab, and lobster, with Andouille sausage and okra. I ordered this last night and probably won't order this again. It's not that good in my opinion and I would much rather order the pan roast. . . New England Clam Chowder - Pretty good. A decent sized bowl with large amount of clam meat. It's nice and creamy, although it can be a bit heavy. . . *I think your experience also depends on who is the chef. I wish I remembered who made my pan roast during the summer of last year. It's still the best one. The chef was amazing with his fast efficiency and execution. I was amazed watching him at work. My food came so fast and was sooo good. Then I went a few months ago and it was a different chef. I seriously question if he was hung over. He spilled oil off the sides to so many times and missed spices for so many of the pans. I was frustrated just watching him.
This place is incredible! I've come to Vegas so many times, have tried so many restaurants/buffets and this place is the one I am always craving for! The line is always ridiculously long so I decided to come at 2am on a Thursday night, still waited an hour to get seated, but when I was leaving at 3am there was no wait so I guess that's the time you need to come if you don't want to wait in line. I am never a fan for oyster but people I've come with said their oyster is very good! But gumbo is a must-get if you come here, there is spice level 1-10, people seem to like it spicy but I like my gumbo at spice level 4 just so that my anus wont explode during my trip. This place is open 24 hours btw!
I first came here many a year ago, and I remember the New England Clam Chowder being absolutely amazing. It wasn't so much this time. It was very flat, but my friend's etouffee was pretty great. . . This was our third attempt at going, as other times, we just didn't have time to wait in the line (which I never dealt with back in the day, but I guess word got out).. . It's still really good though.
Love it!! Went there for the first time in Dec 2013 with a friend and was told the wait will be long because it is just a "bar", which it really is just a bar.  We went on a weekday (wednesday night) and waited at least 30 minutes to be seated.  Don't let appearances fool you because the food is amazing!  I had the pan roast and it was delicious.  Generous serving for the price.  Well worth the wait.  Will come back and eat again.  Not a place for big parties because seating is very limited, I believe only 24 bar seats.  But you must try at least once and you will be hooked.
Oyster Bar is a no doubt a hidden gem in Las Vegas, from what I heard there's an another location in Harrah's but price is higher and probably more crowded since is in the strip.  One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.. . Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.. . Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.. . The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.  . . The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.
If there's a line, it's worth the wait.. . We came here after a night of bar hoping on the strip, and while I was skeptical at first, I'm glad I waited. Don't expect San Francisco fresh seafood (otherwise it would have been 5 stars) but they know what they are doing. A group of 4 of us, we all ordered something different and were all more-than-happy with our meals. The beer I had here was damn good too!. . The hotel it's in isn't that awesome, but it's worth the short drive.
Pan roast was delish, but not necessarily worth the 1.5 hours we stood in line for. Pan roast is basically a tomato bisque filled with seafood and/or chicken/sausages depending on what you order; don't get me wrong...it was really delicious, but that wait DOE! :/
Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.. I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.. I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.. I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) . First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.. PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.. The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.. I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.
I had the Manhattan Chowder and the seafood jambalaya. Both were pretty good but tasted pretty similar. My bf had the  etouffe and that also was very similar. I didn't try the gumbo although it looked identical to everything else.  Very cute experience. I would go back maybe if I had another Cajon craving since this is the only place in vegas I've found. It's a decent place to eat but if u compare it to real Cajun food than u will be a little disappointed.
Not impressed.... . I waited in line for over 2 hours hoping the long wait would be worth it.  Unfortunately I was disappointed (and this was even after drinking 2-3 beers while standing in line!!!).  When my bf and I were finally seated, we ordered more beer, a dozen oysters, a cesar salad, and the gumbo.  I won't rate the beer because it's kind of a given (haha).  The oysters were good- well prepared, fresh, and came out promptly.  I know I can't expect much for a salad from a seafood establishment but the salad was pretty salty and not very fresh.  Plus it was kind of pricey for just lettuce and croutons!  It's cool you see your gumbo or soup made in front of you since you sit at the bar.  However, I wasn't impressed with the gumbo itself.  I know traditional gumbos add file powder to thicken it and it can be a little bitter, but our gumbo was very much on the bitter side (if that makes sense).  Although it's maybe not a far comparison, I much prefer the gumbo at Emeril's Fish House at the MGM.. . Again, unfortunately this experience wasn't what I had hoped especially after seeing all the great yelp reviews.  Maybe I was just cranky I had to wait so long!
Went here on a Thursday Jan 16. I think we got there about 10pm ish. Fyi this is a actual bar that has been converted. I would say max seating capacity is about 18. When we arrived there was about 6 people ahead of us so the wait was about 35 mins.. This place is worth the wait! If you have never had steam kettle prepared food this is the place to try it! My wife and I both ordered the "Palace Station Pan Roast" with lobster added to both orders. You get to select the spice/heat level of the dish. We kept both to a level 3 & that was pretty mild.I did see them make some level 10 using fresh habenero chili in it. And over heard the chef saying that they make one using ghost chili. All of this for me pretty much would waste the taste of the shrimp, lobster, crab etc.. Anyhow our Pan Roast was the best we have ever had! And we have 2 places close to where we live here in so cal to compare it to. The Boiler and Ritter's SKC both of these places have ties to this place.. We also ordered 2 tiger shrimp cocktails. They were top of the line severed with a home made cocktail sauce with fresh ground horseradish. The quality of the shrimp were top notch.. OK here is some advice........DO NOT come here if you are in a rush. Don't come here if you are impatient .Don't come here if you are not up to standing in a short line that moves very slow.. For us it was well worth the wait. Watching the staff prepare the dishes was a show in its self. Hangin out and chatting with the locals is way cool also. Most of the patrons that were here when we were, were locals and return customers.. It was nice to get out of our 5 star blah of the Aria and the ol 45 dollar buffet blues to have something different and tasty! We will definitely return here!
This is my first positive Yelp review for a restaurant that you should grab a bite before going to, it is that slow and it is that good.. . I took off the one star because it is only the second best Oyster Bar I've experienced (the other was in New Orleans and was washed away by Katrina), and it is not uncommon to have to wait for well over an hour to get a seat.. . I've hear of another place over here on the west side that might give Oyster Bar some competition.. . Stay tuned for more...
We needed hang over food after a long NYE. Lucky for us, most people were still hung over in bed, because we arrived at 11:00 am on New Years Day and we were seated immediately-score!. . The server and chef were funny and friendly. Loved that the food is made hot and fresh right before your eyes. We were given dinner rolls to munch on, but I was told to save it to dip in my food. We ordered the Palace Pan Roast and Gumbo. My favorite of the two was the pan roast; it was packed with shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and crab. The gumbo was good, but not as good as my mama's:) . . This place definitely hit the spot. I'll definitely return to try the etouffee.
Here's the rundown:. . - Unique, small, just a bar location inside Palace Station casino. - Waited 15 minutes for two seats at 6:15pm on a Tuesday evening. - Wait looked to be 45 minutes when we left. - Didn't count the seats, but less than 20, all around the bar. - Good personalities in chef, waitstaff. - Watch your food be prepared, including cooking in unique steam pots. - Oysters, Clams, and Shrimp appetizer was very good.. - Enjoyed the Pan Roast ... had no idea what a pan roast was until eating here - loved it.  I had the "combo pan roast".. - Asked how spicy I wanted it, from 1-10.  Asked for 5, but should have said 6-7.. . Conclusion: I'd go back and enjoy another pan roast and the fun setting and service!
I read on yelp that this place has great food so I thought I'd stop by since I was in Vegas. First off there isn't much seating at all, I think it's less than 20 seats. Anyway I went on a cold day so there was a line and I waited an hour half but it was worth it.. . My friend and I ordered the fresh dozen oysters and you get to watch them crack it open for you. Then comes the long wait for the good stuff, the seafood gumbo. I gotta say that this was one of my highlights of my trip (and I won $$$ gambling). I haven't tried much gumbo before but I gotta say that this was worth the hype. The sauce is great for the seafood and I know my gf will like this because she doesn't want her seafood tasting too much like "seafood". The sauce is a little spicy and they ask how spicy you want it from a scale of 1 to 10, I ordered mine a 4 yet it was still spicy so keep that in mind.. . Overall I'm impressed by how one dish makes this place popular. The seafood gumbo is now a "must have" whenever I'm in Vegas.
Actually got seated the second day we tried, and it was excellent.  Went at about 1:30 PM on a Saturday, no-go; wait would have been 2+ hours.  Returned Sunday morning at 0930, three of us were seated immediately, SCORE!  The dozen oysters were big, fresh and tasty.  Each ordered the combination pan roast, with my brother and I asking for 10 on the heat scale.  Several regulars warned us off of that, but we pressed any way.  It takes a while to cook, but it is worth the wait.  The level 10 had quite a kick and was delicious.  .   The only "complaint" I have is that the pan roast retains heat (temperature) like molten lava, the stuff just won't cool down.  Be careful.
Pretty sure this is where 90% of all crazy Vegas stories happen.. . Ate here a couple times last weekend.. Visit 1: Nearly got into a fight with a berzerker Chinese tourist.. Visit 2: Watched a large sassy black woman yell at guy for 30 minutes straight about Viagra. I don't even..can't..brain good.. . Etoufee wasn't for me.. Wayy too salty. Much as I'm ashamed to admit, probably a little too spicy.. Learned my lesson.. Got a 3/10 on the chowder.. Perfection.. . It's like all the seafoods combined.. -Lobster.. -Shrimp.. -Clams.. -Crab.. . Creamy, hot, and filling.. You want this.. Especially at 3am after a night of raging.. . P.S. Don't go at 3am.. P.P.S. No seriously. Don't go. Epic line.. P.P.P.S. It's not even like it's that many people waiting in line. They small batch it and cook it to order, so it just takes awhile for the food to finish. Minimum 1 hr wait.
We've been here twice now for the famous pan roast, and the second time I thought my stomach would literally explode.  Let me explain.  This place is #2 on Yelp's Best of Las Vegas restaurant list.  I never even knew what pan roast was until there was a Yelp Talk thread devoted to it.  Pan roast sounded like some kind of pot roast to me where beef or some meat was roasted in a pan, right?  Wrong.  Pan roast is actually like a giant bowl of lobster bisque with crab, lobster, and shrimp, if you order the combo pan roast, which is what I have gotten both times. And, with that giant bowl comes a giant spoon to eat with. Located inside the Palace Station, the Oyster Bar only seats about 16 people at a time because it is indeed a bar.  People line up patiently for their turn to be seated and served, watching their food being prepared in front of them.  The first time we went, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon and waited for 70 minutes.  Really.  The second time, we got there at 2:00pm on a Friday and waited about 30 minutes.  I've heard stories of people waiting for 2 hours or more.  We talked to a couple in line ahead of us who stay at the Palace Station when they visit just so they can eat at the Oyster Bar.  Service is always friendly and it's fun to speak to your fellow diners; everyone is in a good mood there, maybe because they're finally sitting down and getting their fix while other people wait in line behind them.  . The bread and butter is good and so is the New England Clam Chowder.  Those are the only other items I've had there, but that's all you need to know, really.  If you've never had the pan roast, you should try it at least once so you can taste what all the fuss is about.  It's so good that you just keep eating it, even though you're full, hence the stomach-about-to-burst feeling.  Just try to go on a weekday in the mid-afternoon or some other odd time; they're open 24 hours.
So we're in the middle of the desert -- you know, Vegas -- and we are craving good seafood. It's our first time in Vegas, so what do we do? Consult Yelp!. . The Oyster bar had great reviews and didn't look too expensive, plus it sounded like a great adventure, so we dropped the address in our nav and headed to Palace Station. It was quite a change from the upscale casinos we had visited on the strip, but it was a classic. We found the line and one of us waited while the other made drink runs, and we waited about 40 minutes with 8-10 people ahead of us. No worries, though -- there was great people-watching and we could take turns playing the slots a little bit while we waited.. . Really, the wait was worth it. The oysters were really fresh, and watching Holloman make our pan fried was definitely entertaining. Everything is made in the steamer right in front of you and you can watch every step, request yourspice level, and add or adjust ingredients as you like. The portions were generous and the company was fun. . . The next time we are in Vegas, or even just driving through, we'll stop by the Oyster Bar for sure!
If you can go when Bob and Dolores (probably bucthered the spelling there) are working, do it.  Bob is a fantastic chef and Dolores is a speedy and friendly worker.  . . It's all about the combo roast with the shrimp, crab, and lobster.  I've been going here for years now.  The quality hasn't changed, but the lines have gotten bigger.  . . Expect to stand in line during the lunch/dinner rush for up to 2 hours.   Well worth the wait if you can hang.  Just get some drinks at the Irish bar across the way and play some of the penny slots that are next to the line.
Food was delicious!  So glad I found this place on yelp.  Just happen to be in Vegas and did not want to do the buffets.  Looked in yelp and read the reviews.  So glad we tried it.
