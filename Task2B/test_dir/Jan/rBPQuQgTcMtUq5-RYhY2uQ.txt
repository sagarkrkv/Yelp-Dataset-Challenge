This buffet reminds me of Golden Corral which I can go to for a third of the price. It is dated and dirty. Everything seemed so unhygienic.  I had a hard time eating much. The food was overcooked and dry. It did not seem very French at all. I would not recommend this place at all.
Comparing with the price the food was great, especially the dessert was what you expect from a french pastry. and I love the design, a  wonderful place to seat for food
Years ago, we came here for dinner buffet, and this time we came here for breakfast buffet with Buffet of Buffets (BoB) pass. The breakfast items tasted good and I think I like the breakfast more than their dinner. There was nothing fancy but got some good breakfast items that were freshly made. We got to choose hot chocolate as our drinks as well. . It was an ok breakfast buffet, but not something I would crave for. It's probably our first and last breakfast buffet there.
Oh Noooo Oh Noooo....Terrible Terrible....Let's start with the 1 Hour and A Half (1:30) wait, Once me, wife and 1 & 3 yr old made it in we were in for the worst of this experience. Oh and don't forget if your kids can open their eyes and say bah bah they're in for $19.95 EACH. So with a groupon for me and my wife and a dumb $3.95 bottle of wine which i still have laying around the house somewhere, did i mention my 1 yr old and 3 yr have to pay $19.95 each?...that was only part of the bad experience once in we didn't know what to eat because there's nothing edible to eat. The menu is horrible i tried 5 times to go around the buffet and everytime i will come back to the table with an empty plate no matter how hard i tried, i will pick up one item out of frustation and back to the table, the crepes nothing to brag about i didn't even eat it all tried two different ones both unfortunately had to go to waste the fruit tasted spoiled like it had been sitting out like a week. Thankfully the groupon save me a couple of dollars otherwise i swear i would have somehow someway ask for a refund at the cost.. . I feel bad throwing food away that's why i didn't fill up my plate cause i know that's what i would end up doing but for some reason i managed to control my frustation and disappointment but now that i'm back at home i feel like i should have done just that one plate at a time just dump all of it away i would have save hundredths of people the terrible views of the bland, tasteless, old, hard overcooked food. I'm hoping this happen cause it was during christmas holidays and workers were hating everything about work on those days but i'm not going back to find out if that's what it was. Oh no not me not ever stepping back in there and lord have mercy on those who still go there after they read this review.
First visit here.  And the first thing I noticed is that it's smaller than Rio.  A lot smaller.  Not that it was a small buffet, but it's difficult not to compare to the Rio.  Selection was a little limited, but it had good food. Custom crepes were cool.  They had both "savory" and "sweet" crepes.  I didn't like it as much, but other people (including my wife) seemed to like them a lot.   Other than the crepes most of the dishes were not as French as I expected.  The obligatory chunks o' meat (turkey, ham, prime rib) were there.  Ordinary sides.  They had some dolmas (which were unique).  And their mac and cheese was really good (because it appeared to be made with good pasta and cheeses, not the usual orange sludge one often finds).. . Again, the food was good.  But mostly similar to other buffets.  I really had hoped for more of a French food buffet here.
This was my first "Vegas Buffet" experience and I was utterly disappointed.. . I found their crab legs too salty. I wanted to eat like a mountain full of crab legs just to feel like I've eaten my money's worth but I couldn't even get myself to finish eating just one. I had the same issue with their "macarons". I've put that word in quotations because I felt like I was eating something out of this world. It tasted so weird we couldn't decide if it was lime or pistachio. I will attach photographic evidence to this review and let the photo speak for itself!. . We went around brunch/lunch time on a Friday and the service and overall feel of the place seemed pretty hectic. And there was only ONE WOMEN WASHROOM STALL for the entire buffet. Incredible.. . Maybe I had high expectations because the line up going into the buffet was insanely long (actually out of the 4 buffets we ate at in Vegas, we had to wait the longest for Paris).. . Not worth it.
The setting at Le Village is a little off in my opinion.. Atmosphere feels stuffy and there wasn't anything particularly drawing or fancy about it. The aisles are a little confusing to navigate because they stretch all the way around the back and have a center island.. . I would say I enjoyed having champagne being brought to me for brunch but I can't justify the quality of food and its appeal. Visually speaking, it wasn't a lot. Everything is pretty standard fare for a non-$50 Vegas buffet.. . The good is that there are macarons (which I adore!!!) and crepes!. . Quick Tip: Make reservations through Open Table, there was an intense line when I went!
Love this place.. Used to stay at Paris and usually every time, we'd stop by this place for lunch of dinner.. . This buffet is good quality, nice ambience, and affordable.. . I'd also throw in there that not everything out there is a homerun. It is a buffet so there are times when things sit there too long or have the occasional bad batch... just use common sense and don't eat those.. . Good to take friends, dates, coworkers, and potentially customers.
All you can eat for less than $30. Good food and free champagne before 3pm on weekends if you want.. . Everything from sushi, pasta, tosteaks.. . Good service too.
Wasnt worth $30 came here for brunch .. I was so dissapointed with the food wasn't satisfying at all , and there wasnt alot of different food choices aswell, the desserts were stale and had  a freezer burn taste to it.. def was a waste of time and money .....have no idea y some reviews on here gave this place good reviews... this was the worst buffet ive been to in vegas ....
One of the most enjoyable aspects of this place is the ambience.  Really transports you to a little Street in France. . . Definitely try the crepes!  I started off with a savory crepe which had mushrooms and spinach,  It was absolutely delicious. . . I then tried some pasta with truffle cream sauce that made your mouth water it seo good.  I sampled some lamb & Prime rib that were very good,  Some German like sausages with Kraut, smoked salmon with an assortment of cheeses, some salads and an assortment of other things.  Everything I tried was a party for my palate.  . . Then after my meal I sampled the caramel apple crepe and the strawberry, blueberry, raspberry crepe that were to die for. . . We had a large group and they made us pay 17% gratuity that I thought for a buffet like this was a bit much. Especially when the service is not quite a good as the last time I ate at a Golden coral.... Lol.  . . If you're picking and choosing I would definitely go to Bacchanal in ceasers palace over this one.  However it is worth a try.
There were a long line outside its entrance. Thanks god that we made a reservation and were seated right away. The place was nice and served more free drink options than other places. We went there for our last meal of the Buffet of buffets pass, so we did not really have much space for food. But the crepes were soooo good, that we have 4 of them. Totally worth the waiting and extra calories of over-eating. Good crab legs and desserts too. The salmon and    flounder were the best I had for years.
When it comes to eating at a buffet you, of course have to have a strategy.  Know what you want.  The make very good Brussels  sprouts, duck and other things.  But they also ruined the macaroon. Not impressive!  But hey it's vegas baby.
I love this buffet. I went in not expecting much as i have not had experience in quality buffets before. I loved their clams, shrimps, pork belly, and some kind of pasta and mushrooms in cream sauce. The crepes, you must try! We shared three crepes at our table and my favorite was number 2 (with lots of berries). Also, the macarons are not the best I have had but they are good. They are just a tad bit sweeter than I would like them to be!. . The only negative thing about this buffet was the slow service. If you are someone who just cannot stand this aspect of a dining experience, I would not recommend going here. But your waitresses will get to your table and you will be well on your way to having one of the best buffets of your life!. . Overall, I love levillage for their food and the french atmosphere. I would recommend!. . Another tip: Use groupon! we were a party of 3 and used groupon deal for 2 ppl ($35) and normal price for 1 person ($29). Pretty cheap for a quality buffet!
I was Very disappointed with the experience.. The cheese bar had 4 cheeses none of them European.. I did not expect muenster, cheddar, smoked mozzarella, and pepper jack to be on a French theme buffet.. The place was moderately full and it was an hour wait on line.. The service after we were in was horrible.. When i asked the waitress, what did they have for red wine, it was as if I was talking another language. Is French theme she should be able answer me knowledgeable.. Avoid if you can. 4 for lunch 135.00
We decided come to come to this buffet during our trip to Vegas simply because we couldn't make up our minds as to where to go and we just happened to be at Paris that day. The line looked long when we arrived, but it didn't take long to get to the front. Each person was almost $30 if I remember correctly, $24.99 plus tax came out to almost $30 on a weekend lunch. We were seated in an appropriate manner that didn't take too long, thank goodness. We got tables for 6 in an almost room like area where it was slightly closed off, which made it a little quieter.. . FOOD: I don't remember anything that stood out, had the usual meat slices and mashed potatoes and vegetables. I also had the shrimp cocktail which were relatively fresh with a good crunch, the cocktail sauce itself tasted really weird almost like medicine. I was really grossed outby it, definitely didn't get seconds on that. They were all pretty meh, I only ended up having two plates of food. For dessert we had the creme brulee that was a little too soggy and didn't have that good crunch on top. But they had this really cool crepe station that makes crepes to order, I ordered a sweet crepe, Le Siege that consisted of whipped cream, nutella, and bananas. It was actually really good, I liked the outside batter when its fresh off the cooker thing but it gets really soggy if you don't eat it quick enough. I loved it because they put so much nutella in it! Mmmm!. . SERVICE: Quick to clean the dishes and often offered to refill our drinks for us. They were also very friendly and happy to assist us when we had questions as to where something was.
We decided to get the 24 hour buffet pass and went here first for a sunday brunch.  The wait was a but long bit it was well worth it.  I had crepes, various meats, including a fantastic prime rib, mac and cheese, and chocolate croissants done closer to French style than American style. The service was excellent.  The chocolate croissants would probably have been better earlier in the day since by the time we showed up they were a bit old, but still tastey.  Would definitely go back.  Well worth the price, especially if you get it as some sort of deal.  I have spent more money on food with much poorer quality.
Crepes are incredibly delicious! Worth a try and penny! Even there macaroons are freshly baked and different. They used special whipped cream inside then the usual feeling. I even loved their roast beef and pasta!!! Soo yummy!
I went there for breakfast and was early enough to avoid the lines. When I was seated the server asked me what I wanted to drink. When I asked for a latte it was like I was speaking another language. I settled for their coffee. The layout of the food is bizarre. There is a station for toast but the jam is on the other side of the room. If you want cereal and milk, you can help yourself to the cereal but have to ask hour server to get you some milk. They had smoked salmon and nearby was a bowl labeled whipped cream cheese. It turned out to be whipped cream, a little sweet for the salmon. There was a lot to choose from and none of it looked or tasted very good.
I went here many years ago and thinking that it was really impressive.  My latest trip has taken a 5 star review down to 3.  There really is nothing extraordinary about this buffet, other than the fact that it is in the Paris hotel.  The buffet is not really long either!  I remember there being a lot of fishy foods, which I could careless for.  The wait line on a Sunday evening was 1 hour!  It is NOT worth the wait!
Decided to eat here after finding out that the line for Bachanaal and Wicked Spoon were over 2 hours long! Went here on a Saturday, around 12pm, waited about 40 minutes for a table. Reading the reviews, was kind of mixed on whether we would enjoy this or not, but it was a pleasant surprise. Granted it was our one and only trip to a buffet in Vegas, but super pleased with it. Had pretty much anything you could want and it was all delicious. We got the brunch, so it was unlimited Mimosas (hey I'm a southern lady, love Mimosas ;)  The prime rib was excellent. Also they had a crepe station and you could either pick from their menu or just tell the guy making them what you would like on yours. They were delicious. Oh and for the price compared to the other places, we were really happy with our choice. It seemed "cheap" compared to the other hotels, but there was nothing cheap about the quality, quantity or flavor of the food.
There was a really long line but we waited the food is really good and really fresh and really enjoyed the evening.
This is the only Vegas buffet I have been to (shame on me, I think!). Le Village Buffet (brunch buffet) was decent enough. The food was good, but nothing to knock your socks off and make you want to come back. . . We arrived around 10am and only had a few minute wait. By the time we left, there was a considerable queue to get seated. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently each station at the buffet represents a different region of France and, accordingly, the food at the various stations relates to the region's specialties (allegedly). Regardless, it made it a tad bit convoluted to gather food for your plate (first world problem - now I feel a little ashamed for complaining about a brunch with TOO much food to chose from). For example, fried hash brown wedges were at one station, hashbrowns across the room at another, potato wedges at another. You should take a stroll around the entire buffet first to see what they are offering. The crepe station was the most popular and there was a line the entire time we were there. . . The person who seated us took our drink orders (coffee, water, etc.) but couldn't take orders for mimosas. Once our waitress showed up, she took our order for mimosas. I thought they were unlimited, but she never returned to the table so not sure about that. I'm sure a few more mimosas and I would have remembered this buffet more fondly. :). . Summary: Decent enough. They had a large variety of standard breakfast food to chose from.
