If you are looking for a "show" this is NOT it. Go see La Reve, O, Love or ANYTHING else!!
From a Las Vegas local: Favorite show on the strip!
I did not like this show at all.  Maybe it is all the overweight people practically naked walking around the stage.  But I didn't like the sex aspect and all of the adult like themes.  It was boring and a turnoff to me.
Very fun show! Got comped tickets from MyVegas and they were front row center. From the beginning of the show to the end there were lots of laughs and amazing performances. My wife was pulled on stage for a bit even. The performers interaction with the audience was outstanding and very quick thinking in their feet. Had a total blast.
Major disappointment. I don't understand how 1000 people have this an average of 4 stars. And I really don't understand how Cirque would want this show attached to their good name. Even though it was too much, I could deal with the sexual references and toplessness (some was unnecessary though), but there was hardly any acrobatics or a performance that you expect to get when paying $100 each for Cirque tickets. . . The Drag Queen MC was annoying and talked way too much, and many of the attempted jokes left me falling asleep in my chair.
This show was awesome. Funny, sexy, and amazing acrobatics. How do they do that stuff!?!  . . Get there early. The pre-show is hilarious, and you may just get called out for being late. Have a few drinks before you get there. . . The acrobats are awesome. And scantily clad. If you're not into that this isn't the show for you. The Drag Queen emcee is very funny and has really nice legs ;) . . The theatre is nice, the seats are comfy, not a bad seat in the house. If you sit in the front it is likely you will be embarrassed at some point. . . My husband and I saw this together- it is geared toward couples. Cons: too short, drinks are expensive (like everywhere else). Pros: awesome acrobats and lots of funnies.
Fun, spicy and beautiful. I really enjoyed this show! And if you think which show to see in Vegas (this is kind of must-to-do in Las Vegas) Zumanity is the one.. P.S.: I heard that there are some discounts for military.
I went here the other with somewhat high expectations. I've heard a lot of people say that they liked the show. Now, these are people who have never seen cirque du soleil shows and people who have. I thought it'd be at least a decent show. I, however did not like the show that much. Maybe because it's not my cup of tea? I'm not really into sensual shows or things like that. There were only 2 acts that I enjoyed, and they were the hulu-hoop girl and the girls in the water bowl. Those were the only 2 acts that had any acrobatics to the show. All of the other acts bored me, and I just wasn't interested. I believe the couple behind me actually walked out of the show. . . It was funny because I did laugh during bits and pieces of the show.
Worst show ever. I'm surprised that cirque even produced such a horrible show. The constant suggestions that it's unnatural for heterosexual men not to experiment with homosexuality or beastiality is repulsive. Constant persuasion that it's ok to commit adultery is disturbing. What makes this  1000 times worse is the tactic of the cast encouraging the crowd to clap causing massive manipulation. So bad
