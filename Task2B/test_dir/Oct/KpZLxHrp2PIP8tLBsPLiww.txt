The boy and I went to Vegas and stayed for 4 nights in July. Neither of us had ever been so I made sure to do tons of research on just about everything: shows, food, and where to stay. I read the reviews on here for The Signature and I just felt like it was the place for us. I'm 23, the boy is 25, and we're not really into the "Oh my gosh, I'm 21, LET'S PARTY" nonsense. Keep those hoodlums away from us! (Kidding, but seriously.). . This hotel is absolutely beautiful and way more laid back than the others, as we basically went in every one on the strip. We got a deal on the website, which I think was around $100 a night (not including the $25ish resort fee per day) plus a $50 comp for food in The Signature or the MGM Grand itself. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me. My cousin was also in Vegas at the time and stayed at a hotel on the strip (maybe the Bellagio?) and we saw his room and I actually liked ours better. More space, had a balcony (for about the same price he paid without one), and the bathroom, specifically the tub, was WAY better. This hotel is technically off the strip but that means it's fairly quiet, not super crazy, and you'll actually be able to sleep at night. It does have hallways that connect to the MGM Grand which makes it pretty convenient to get on the strip without walking in the heat. As long as you don't mind some exercise, the location really isn't a problem.. . The front desk staff was welcoming and helpful. The valet workers were always nice. The clean up staff always did a fantastic job! We had a room in Tower 2 with a king bed. The bed was amazingly comfy and I slept so well! There was also a kitchenette with a toaster, mini fridge, and sink. A desk, couch, and coffee table were also in the room. The bathroom was HUGE! It had a huge tub with jets which was like, heaven. The shower was also a great size as were the counters. You got double sinks and a separate little room for the toilet. Coffee and organic tea (yep, thank you Jesus!) were provided after each cleaning.. . I really enjoyed staying at The Signature because everyone working there was fantastic. However, with that being said, I do have a few minor complaints, which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. When I checked in, I knew I would have to pay up front the rest of the nights (they only charge you for one night when you book to save your space I suppose). I knew roughly the cost, after adding the other nights and resort fees, but I had NO idea they were going to charge me $100+ for liability. The lady at the front desk explained to me what it was, saying it's basically a safety net for them in case we trashed the place, which I'm sure happens quite often in Vegas. I totally understood, but just wish that had appeared somewhere in the booking process or in the confirmation e-mail I received. I received all of that money back about 3-5 business days after we left. I totally understand why we had to pay it, just didn't like that it was sprung on me.. . Also, and I'm sure this is going to be the fact at just about any hotel near the Strip, but I wish there was an option to park my own car. My boyfriend and I actually were taking a cross-country trip so we had my truck. It was so annoying to have to wait each time we wanted to go somewhere because the valet had to get it. Not to mention you have to tip them every time they take your car or bring it to you! It just got a little expensive. I'd much rather do the work myself and walk to my car.. . Despite those two minor flaws, I'd definitely stay here again. It was nice to be on the strip, in the commotion, during the day then retreat to this quiet hotel at night. Unless I find another hotel that is slightly off the strip and quiet like The Signature, the boy and I are definitely always going to book here.
My friends and I stayed two nights at the hotel.  The part I liked the best was the huge bathroom with a shower and huge jacuzzi tub.  I decided to see how the tub was with the jets, and two of the jets shot water up and across onto the wall.  We were also missing a knob.  . . If youlike to work out the gym is pretty awesome, except it's warm.  There is one bar to do curls with, free weights, elliptical, treadmill, some machine weights, and cold wet towels as well as green apples.  . . There wasn't anything spectacular about the hotel.  I wish there were more outlets around the bed, or plugs within the lamps.  Our ipod dock also had a mashed up button.. . It has a kitchenette, fridge, microwave, LG tv.  The TV guide didn't match up with the stations. I selected E and ended up with Bloomberg.  . . I was in Arizona right before and stayed at a hotel at a fraction of the price and had more tv stations, free wifi, free breakfast, and parking, and a tv that matched up with the stations.. . I don't like resort fees.  Your resort fee of $15 includes water bottles, newspaper, a clean room, valet parking, wifi and use of the gym which closes early as well as the pool which closes at 7.  If this is Vegas, the city that doesn't sleep, why does the gym and pool close so early?  If I'm paying for it in this fee, I'd like to use it more frequently.. . . It's funny to me that you can go to a cheap motel and get free wifi, but go to a more fancy one and you have to pay for it.  . . The only other thing I tried out in the hotel was Starbucks, which is a rip off.  I paid $3.60 for a tall iced hazlenut coffee with no cream.
At first glance the room looked nice; nice decor. Upon closer look, the couch seams are frayed; stain on sitting bench; stained area on wallpaper; and carpet looks a bit soiled. The mattress  is okay but my $2600 mattress at home is nicer.  Bathroom and kitchenette are very nice.  We are going to pay a little more next time and try the Venetian.
The Signature is a nice enough hotel. The rooms are big and the bathrooms have large jacuzzi tubs for two. The beds were comfy and we had a nice view off the strip from our room. The hotel is a bit of the strip but it's nice that the tram pick up is so close to the hotel. They have little fridges and microwaves in the room along with a range stop stove. You could cook a full meal here. Customer service was just ok. We had a large group and the front desk did not try to work with us on our requests to be near each other. They put our friends in a regular room after they paid for an upgrade. It was a nice hotel but I would prob try somewhere else in the future.
This hotel was fabulous and the staff were a pleasure to work with. We arrived at the hotel around midnight and the front desk staff greeted us with smiles and they went above and beyond for us. We was in tower 2 on the 37th floor and the view was to die for. . . Our one bedroom suite was flawless and everything was outstanding.  Anything you needed they made sure you received it. I love how each tower connected and how they all had a different theme, scent and flower arrangements. We also loved how it connect to the MGM grand. . . I stayed here for 7 days and I have no complaints. We would call housekeeping at 2am and they would come to assist us with smiles. This is by far the best hotel I've every stayed in and when I return to Vegas I'll be staying here again.
We are here and are staying for 5 nights! It is a great hotel and perfect for my kids and I! We have never been here before so there is something I wish I knew! The m life card gets you discounts! So I thought this card comes in the mail and I missed out on having it, but a lady just told me that you go get it in the casino and I should have been showing everyone it! I have already spent like $2000 without it! Make sure you pick that card up! Besides the lack of knowledge of just being a new visitor it's a great place! The lazy river is amazing! My daughter is allergic to the pool right on this property, not sure what the difference is but something!. . I don't have my receipts but I know for next time!
Pros: Great service, jacuzzi tub, balcony, spacious rooms, comfy bed, free wifi. . Cons: No early check in, not many places closeby (only a small deli and Starbucks in the towers that close early). . Enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The suite is pretty average looking with no fancy embellishments, but it's comfortable. I enjoyed the privacy and lack of huge lines for taxi/crowds from casinos. My only real gripe, which isn't particularly really their fault, is that our room was right next to the elevators and we could hear them moving all night which made it hard to sleep.. . So I'd recommend this hotel for a comfortable and quiet stay with reasonable prices. Nothing flashy or super classy. Just request a room not next to the elevators.
The Signature at the MGM is another great place to stay. The hotel is a smoke free hotel and that was a huge plus for us. The staff were all wonderful and friendly. Another good thing was that it was connected to the MGM so you walk through the towers.. Our room UPH( upper penthouse) was on the 38th floor with a beautiful view .The room was very nice and up to date. It has a wonderful king size bed with a pull out couch bed. The bathroom had a jacuzzi, shower, and  his and her's sink and small flat screen tv. The room also has a small kitchen area. . The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star was that the housekeeping was lacking. We had to call 3 times for towels. . Another than that The Signature is great place, and I would stay with them again in the future since Vegas is our second home.
Just went to the Signature this weekend and really enjoyed the whole experience. The hotel is a smoke free hotel and it is connected to the MGM through an indoor walk way.  . Our room was on the 34th. It was a 2 Bedroom 3 Bath suit with full kitchen and balcony. The room was very nice and up to date. . The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star is because they don't offer airport pick up and the hotel itself doesn't have any place to really eat. They just have a Starbuck and a little deli. . I will defiantly stay there again.
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! this place! You can usually find amazing deals on this hotel if you book using an mlife card. The rooms are very nice. Big rooms, big bathrooms, great amenities. Super comfy beds. Even the pull out queen size sofa bed is comfortable. I usually book a balcony suite when I stay here. Floor to ceiling windows with amazing strip views. Kitchenette in the room as well with a decent size smaller fridge. Great if you don't feel like eating out, or if you are trying to stay on a budget. Part of the MGM hotel, but separate. Non smoking, and no casino. Relaxing environment to recharge your batteries before hitting the casino scene again
My husband and I have been to Vegas at least a dozen times, and this was our least favorite hotel stay. There were several things we found lacking:. . --Proximity to the Strip. It's a long walk from Tower 2 to the MGM Grand and then to the Strip. Now, don't get me wrong--I have a Fitbit and appreciate getting credit for all the steps, but on top of all the other walking in Vegas to get from place to place, just getting back to the room is a chore. You can't just run up to your room to drop something off or grab a jacket. . . --Access to amenities. My husband loves casino hotels that have 24-hour sundry shops. He likes to stop in for a beer and snacks before heading back to the room. There's nothing like that at the Signature, other than a small vending machine on Floor 2 (we were on the 32nd floor). Not even a Coke machine on any other floor than Floor 2. And there's no express elevator so it's a long ride.. . --Room quality. When we arrived, our TV and remote were both broken. We were going to watch a movie one evening but couldn't because the remote wouldn't work, and even the power button on the TV was broken. We had to unplug the TV to turn it off. This was fixed the next day. On our final night, the toilet broke. Thank god it flushed, but it took about 30 minutes to fill the tank, so you could only use the toilet once every 30 minutes. . . --Housekeeping. Our housekeeper didn't show up the second day. We were gone from about 9:30 to 3. My husband called and then they said they'd come at 6:30. That would've been fine if the housekeeper hadn't come by at 5 to clean the room, just as I was about to get in the shower. She hadn't heard about the 6:30 cleaning time. . . --On the morning of our departure, again while I was just about to shower, someone (I presume hotel staff) came by and rang the doorbell at 9:30am. Thank goodness we were up, but I was still in my pajamas. When she she saw me, she said nevermind, I'll come back. WTF? Why come by all? She had some paperwork in her hand. I don't appreciate being interrupted in the morning, period.. . The experience wasn't completely negative. The lobby is smoke-free, and you can catch a cab there. The Signature is near the District area in MGM, so it's close to the restaurants and clubs (and the monorail). There is a small cafe but we didn't try it. Our room had a mini-fridge that wasn't stocked, which means you can put your own stuff in there (handy). Overall the room was nice, but not the nicest. There just wasn't enough of the Las Vegas experience in this hotel. We won't stay here again.
We booked 5 rooms for our daughter's wedding.  The front desk staff really blew it and didn't reserve our rooms on the same floor, facing the strip ( as was promised when we booked directly with the hotel two months in advance).  HOWEVER,  Audrey King, the manager, fixed everything and handled it so well that I give this place 5 stars!  She stepped in, rebooked and moved us to the appropriate tower, and truly had miraculous service recovery.. About the hotel - GREAT rooms, great service staff, and we never had any issues.  The suites are like condos, comfortable beds, and no smokiness at all.. Stay in tower 3 if you don't want noise - the pool by tower 1 ROCKS and the bass can be felt even on the highest floors!. Tower 3 was quiet, well decorated and the staff excellent! . You have to walk a bit to get to the MGM - its all inside hallways though and we enjoyed that!. There are great places to eat and gamble and party at the MGM, but we frequently also went to the strip ( less than a block) and enjoyed the Bellagio fountains, all kinds of restarants, etc.. . Again, THANK YOU to Audrey King for ensuring our stay was perfect for this wedding!  We will never forget it!. . Tracy
We own two units at The Signature, a Jr. suite and a one bedroom. We rent them for vacation rentals but stay here often. We love The Signature ! Non smoking property. Well made, quiet and really beautiful.
