Fantastic! Best service and meal ever! Chris and Gary served us andhelped us pair the perfect wine with our steak! Bravo Chris and Gary for making our experience an awesome one!
Made a reservation for 4 on Open Table. Excellent service. And I mean EXCELLENT. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The food is delicious, well, the mac and cheese had a little too much garlic for our liking, and the corn was too sweet.. . The Beef Wellington is amazing, only thing is that they're only cooked to medium rare. But they're still amazing. The short rib is pretty darn good. and the potatoe puree is delicious.. . I'll come back for sure.
DONNIE you are the man!!! Any yelper foodies that want phenomenal service from a true foodie server, this is your guy!!!! He was so informative about their menu and also asked us questions to see what direction we may to go in ordering. I told him that I had always wanted to try a true Japanese Wagyu and he excused himself from the table to see if the marbling was adequate on the Kobe for that particular evening. He brought out the a 3 oz sample for me to view.  I appreciated that extra step to make sure I was pleased.  Let me just say that it lived up to all the hype. It was seasoned to perfection not to change the flavor of the meat itself.  Fantastic!!! My wife had a Lobster Wellington.  She too was blown away by the flavor.  As for the side dishes we had an awesome mac n cheese and an asparagus that was way too salty.  But it did not warrant removing a star from my review.  As for the dessert we tried none other than the sticky toffee pudding that just blew us away.  Donnie made our evening a night to remember.  We went out to several restaurants during our stay in Vegas and enjoyed several great meals. Donnie on the other hand took our experience at Gordon Ramsay's Steak to a new level!!!!
There are a few times in life when a meal is so expertly crafted and planned that it is nothing short of genius. Last night, I had one of those meals! This place was EXCELLENT from the hosts, to the servers, to the cleaning/clearing staff, to the food!!! Best experience ever! I must go here each time I'm in Vegas!!
The ideal date for Steak: good looking with nothing to say. The reason: it's so noisy, you can't hear yourself talk. Jackhammers would be an improvement. Hostesses in short skirts with sexy pantyhose do not a restaurant make. Our waiter didn't hear our order so came back forty minutes later to ask if we had made our choice! Take a miss.
Long time fan and finally for the chance to eat here the food was amazing  went here on 9/27/14 our server Charles did a great job as well the the guy that was showing the wines he really knew his stuff there was only one thing we didn't like was that we asked to taste the steak sauce we only had 2 thin lasts slices and we only use a spoon full of it and got charged for the steak sauce we didn't know and weren't informed that there would be an extra charge if we did we would've of order it because we just had two bite sides left . The overall food was amazing service was amazing
Marvelous.. . I came here with a pastry chef colleague of mine who used to work with the (now) GM, so we didn't even have to order. We simply sat down and the kitchen just started sending course after course. Of my amazing food coma, the stand-outs for me were the beef wellington and the creamed corn side. We had various small bites brought to us, so I don't think they were on-menu, but presentation was exquisite and service was excellent.. . My favorite part of the entire meal was dessert: a delicious cake with brown butter ice cream. My pastry chef friend told me the secret to the cake was the use of pureed sweet figs in the batter...genius. It was moist, fluffy and memorable. Paired with the ice cream, it was a 5-star dessert for me.. . The atmosphere is loud and nearly club-like. I wasn't there on a romantic outing so I enjoyed the vibe. I am definitely looking forward to coming back to enjoy the bar and more of that dessert!
Great atmosphere... amazing food... (i had the beef wellington and nochi apitizere) will defently go again once i can afford it!! :)
I was so disappointed.  We were there for 2 1/2 hours for the "Ramsey Experience"!  And the food was not that great.  For $145 per person I expected to be impressed.  The only thing that came quickly were the drinks.  Our "experience" included a quail egg (not bad, somewhat tasty), octopus (was supposed to be charred but my friend's piece was just burnt) scallop risotto ( had to send back because not completely cooked) and beef Wellington (now I know I don't like beef Wellington - missed their chance to impress me) and dessert was some sort of toffee thingy plus a couple of other treats.  I pretty much did not care at this point and did not like any of the desserts.  The loud pounding club music could have also contributed to my attitude.  Never again! Don't do it - not worth the price and definitely not worth the wait!
The service and food was amazing. They made me feel like I was part of a family. I recommend this place if you are wanting some great food. I had the tasting menu from Hells Kitchen it was amazing from the octopus said to the beef Wellington.
Amazing food. Amazing steak. Amazing deserts. French press coffee...   what more to say but amazing!  . We started with the shell fish sampler.. absolutely  exquisite. We all had steak.. might I warn you that the bone in ribeye is HUGE!  did not get 25% done. We also had a peanut butter pie and a chocolate mousse.. both very good, make sure you get coffee with it. Waiters  are very knowledgeable but you will spend some $$$$  . With minimal  alcohol we dropped  $500 so buyer beware but once a year.... awesome
If you are ever in Vegas and want to have a food experience for all the senses, then make your reservations for Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Omg this place was exquisite!   The decor, staff, and food were brilliant, just brilliant (as the British would say).  I came here on a Saturday night with an early reservation at 4:45pm, but even though we were 10 minutes late, the table was still available and we were lucky enough to be seated by the kitchen.  I loved watching the chefs and servers as they busily moved through the kitchen, so much action comparable to Gordon Ramsay's "Hell's Kitchen," yet the staff worked very well as a team.   We had the limited edition tasting menu for $145 a person. This included 5 dishes that could be complimented with wine for an additional $75.  The beef Wellington was so tender and flavorful, it made my teeth happy from not having to do as much work.  I recommend you make an early dinner reservation so that you can enjoy your meal and not feel too rushed, that way you still have time to catch a show, go gamble, or dance the night away.  Go ahead and splurge at Gordon Ramsay Steak, you deserve it!
I was there for our 35th wedding anniversary. It should have been special. The room is great. The Wellington was great, but could have used a sauce and some mushrooms, but meat was divine. The bar staff were cold, close to rude. We were dressed up, make a good living and were polite. There was no excuse for it. What really ruined the experience was the music. Ok, we're older, so not our style, but we're open...we could live with it. But, it was unnecessarily loud. Irritating and hard to converse. We looked around at the tables and nobody would have minded some Sinatra, Dean or Buble wouldn't have hurt.
"Shut it down!!" Not really though...this place has become a Vegas staple for us. They really do everything well from the ambiance, to the appetizers, amazing libations to a beef Wellington that should surely be on your bucket list if you have not tried it yet. For all the yelling and Hollywood jiving Ramsay does on TV the man knows how to run a restaurant cleanly and professionally. The servers are friendly, and never douchey as you might expect. Get dressed up and go there for a date night, your wallet may regret it but you won't.
In Vegas for a business trip and thought I would give one of my favorite TV celebrities a try. Gordon Ramsey Steak did not disappoint. It is pricey but I think we got more than our money's worth. I got a cut of Kobe beef which melted in my mouth. Everything was seasoned perfectly. And the Mac n cheese was the most amazing thing I have ever tried. If you're going to splurge this is definitely the place to do it!
I really enjoyed our meal here! It's expensive but worth it. This place gets a 4.5/5.. . We wanted to try a fine dining experience and I am glad that we chose this restaurant. We ordered a few things to share. What was really thoughtful and a great idea was that the kitchen prepared everything as separate portions so that we didn't need to divide the dishes ourselves. . . Service 5/5. Service was excellent! There was a lot of staff, but they all had a purpose. There was one person just refilling everyone's water, another clearing table, and folding napkins. I did sometimes seem to get real busy with so many staff. The sommelier came over to the table to ask what we were eating and recommend a wine. This was another great touch! The manager was also walking around making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves.. The atmosphere had a good vibe to it. We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was very busy. Everyone around us seemed to be having a great time.. . Food 4.5/5. Our waiter was friendly, and we got a brief tutorial on the different cuts and types of steak the restaurant serves. Having the steak cut examples as a visual, really helped. This is one of the few restaurants I've been to that does this. . . We got some free bread to start off the meal, which was great. For appetizers ordered the Hamachi Crudo. This was delicious light and delicate, the garlic puree was not overpowering. The Hamachi was soft and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend who usually dislikes garlic loved this dish. We also had to potato and octopus salad. The dish was nicely balanced and I really enjoyed the potatoes and vinaigrette. The appetizers were delicious.. . For mains we ordered the American Rib Cap. The steak was well cooked, and tender, and the marbling on the beef gave it a fatty richness to the steak; however I thought it was way too salty for me. This was the only dish that I didn't enjoy as much. We got the beef wellington and it was yummy and AMAZING! The pastry was light and crispy, and the steak was tender and juicy. The vegetables and the potato puree were tasty. They helped cut the richness of the wellington, worked well with the meat. I loved the red wine demi-glace. I can see why this dish is Gordon's signature dish, it was lovely. They served both mains at the same time, which was great however by the time we finished the beef wellington the rib cap had gotten a bit cold. . . Sadly I was too full to try any of the desserts. Overall we had lovely experience here. We had a couple of disappointing meals before this and I am glad this lived up to expectations.
This place is excellent! Our waiter and the staff were helpful and attentive. The bone in rib eyes and lobster Wellington as well as the seafood appetizer were all prepared and cooked to perfection. We will be back!
As a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I can honestly say i had very high hopes for this place. Well, my expectations were met and exceeded. I ordered the beef wellington and for the love of God that was by far the best piece of meat i have ever tasted. It literally melted in my mouth. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to do it all over again!
I really really wanted to give this place 5 stars because I love Gordon Ramsay! Went to his taping for Hell's Kitchen when it was here in Vegas and I just love the hype around him..unfortunately,I wasn't that impressed by the food.. We went here a few months back for my dad's birthday. I got the "famous" beef wellington which was ok. I was hoping to be blown away but it was just ok. My dad got the rib-eye which was also good but there are other places in the city that are better. My mom got the chicken which I surprisingly liked out of all the dishes. We also ordered the mac and cheese which was delicious. I do have to say their complimentary bread has some of the best selections but that's pretty much it. Also,they don't give you a dessert for specials occasions which I found odd because most restaurants do. Oh well...probably not going back here but I am willing to try his other restaurants.
Hey how is everyone?! I am just reviewing gordon ramsay's steakhouse in Las Vegas. I went here in July and I just want to rate my experience. I'm using the KISS method, please let me know if you like this style.. . K- the place is really clean, very immaculate and the decor was great. There was no dust in sight.. . I- the place was immaculate, the hostess was very accommodating and dressed in professional clothes. The waiter and the helpers really represented the restaurant well.. . S- the service was grade a awesome. They put the napkin on your lap when they seat you. They let you see what the steak looks like before you order it, kind of like a desert tray. The water that they used was in a wine type bottle, so they used grade a water. The wait time was exceptional, and everything came out at the right time. They were also very attentive to us and filled our water whenever it was empty.. . S- overall satisfaction was good. This review would have been 5 stars but the steak was dry and not juicy at all. It was kind of shocking, I had the filet mignon. All the sides were really good, they had a great alcohol selection too. . . Overall, this place was great, the steak was good but not as good as I thought but everything else was just perfect!
Spend the kind of money this place charges, and you have the right to expect a meal experience perfectly tailored to you-- particularly if you have a food allergy. Our table got the tasting menu (you have you decide as a table) except one of our party has a gluten allergy. Not a self imposed gluten-free diet. A gluten allergy. And it was all but ignored. He was told to scrape the breading off of things, and just not to eat other things. All in all, I was disappointed that he had to pay the same price I did. Also, the food was average, not great, and the environment is loud and not befitting a fine meal. . . Bottom line: Not worth it, go somewhere else.
I have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours. Maybe a little dramatic, but I had huge expectations. I may very well be Gordon's biggest fan. When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. . . When we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up, so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. . . I knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. . . The presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. . . I started with the onion soup. It was really good, but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. . . The beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. . . We did a side of sauteed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. . . I had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back, but threw in the towel and went to bed. . . In the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back.
UPDATE: The manager of Gordon Ramsay Steak contacted me on Yelp, apologized, and offered to personally make us a reservation for Thanksgiving. I really appreciate it when restaurant managers take reviews seriously and make an effort to correct the mistake. We decided to take him up on it, and look forward to having a great time in a few weeks.
Food was ok and we ain't impressed.. . We ordered quite a few items from the appetizers menu and had the steaks of our likes.  The pan seared foie gras was dry and overcooked, i can make it better at home.  Gnocchi was mushy. Kurobuta pork belly, smoked beef tartar, crab soup were ok.  Hamachi tasted delicious.. . My hubby and I shared a roasted beef wellington for 2.  The steak itself was dry aged steak so it wasnt juicy, well seasoned, covered with the puff pastry.  The puff pastry was very mushy however the steak itself was delicious.. . We both love formal dinning but we are so fed up with those big name over price with so so quality of food.  Wish i can throw dishes like Mr Ramsay himself! haha!
Went there last month after a friend recommended this for a good steak.  This experience was one of the best dining experiences we've had.  Great staff, knowledgable, we never had to wave or ask for anything.  They were literally two steps ahead of us.  They kept our stomachs and glasses full the entire night.  The food and cocktails were amazing.  Our server was outstanding.  When in Vegas...go to to Gordon Ramsay Steak!  A must!
Butter for the  3 types of different bread was incredible! We got the the filet and  the Ribeye and wow... We usually go to Morton's for our Anniversary , but this tear we decided to change things up.  It surpassed all expectations. From the  loaded potatoes to the roasted heirloom carrots.  Everything was GREAT!  SLightly more than what you would pay atMorton's , but well worth it. Alex, our server, was awesome. If you go and get this guy, you'll be well taken care of.
Great burgers! Cant wait to eat here again! Good atmosphere and drinks too!  One of the best burgers i have ever eaten! Service was goid too! We usually eat at fancier places while in vegas, but this place was really good. Several types of french fries too!  Waiters show you a drink menu on an ipad. Fun place to eat!
Wow wow wow wow !!!!!! This place is amazing ... The level of ....service ......impeccable from our waiter Lumberto to our servers assistant incredible !! The bill is steep there is no doubt ... But I would say it is totally worth it ... Definitely will come again in our next trip !!!
Incredible experience! My boyfriend and I were on vacation and we wanted to do  something different and special. The service was first class - we enjoyed the interactive drink menu, our server was incredibly knowledgable about the food and wine menu. He was busy but still very attentive to us - making small talk whenever he can and made sure our food was to our liking and giving us his suggestions. The maitre was very friendly and warm. The food runners were great! . . The food was spectacular! We started off with drinks - my boyfriend had a whiskey cocktail and I had a wonderful glass of Pinot noir. We ordered the gnocchi foran app which was accompanied by delicious home made breads. And we shared an incredible porter house steak with a side of brussels spouts and Mac and cheese. Everything was served in a very presentable manner and timed well. This was hands down, one the best meals we have ever had! . . I think what impressed me the most was how clean the entire restaurant was. Our table was facing the kitchen and we saw first hand how much pride Chef Ramsey had in having a clean kitchen and restaurant. Every detail was accounted for. The chefs, the food runners were constantly cleaning. Our server made sure our table was always clean - meaning, no crumbs on our table and if a plate was empty, it was immediately removed from our table. We also noticed that the bar was spotless! When a bartender was not helping a customer or server or was not making a drink, they were cleaning. I've never seen a restaurant or bar where every single person who worked there knew the importance of cleanliness, so this was pretty impressive in my eyes. I know to some people, this may not seem like a big deal but to me, this made the experience that much more memorable.
This was my second time at the GRS, I actually stayed in the paris this time so I could easily get there.  I had the gnocchi app, wellington and sticky toffee dessert.  All and all, good but not as good as last time.  Last time I had the new york strip and no desert.   Both times I have gone I could not get a table and had to sit at the bar, no biggie, I really like the breads, the strip on trip one - great fantastic,  The wellington on this trip, the pastry was soggy and quickly fell apart, and there was two 0.5 sq" cubes of carrot and turnip - so when it says root vegetable and you are hungry get a side. The sticky toffee was great but man oh so filling and sweet.  All and all I was happy but like others I had high hopes, but you know Gordon  cant be everywhere.  Service and decor was great, people were very friendly,  all and all my meal was $120 I have paid more and got less but again had high hopes - the first time was better - at least my food wasnt RAWW!
Wow!! That's the best way to describe my experience. My wife and I ordered the American Filet and American Rib Cap and they were easily the 2 best steaks we've ever had. We shared the Mac n cheese for a side which we both loved as well and then the butter toffee pudding for desert. Every piece of food we had was amazing and plan on going back for sure. The service was also the best we've ever had. Our only complaint was that it was a little noisy but not enough to dock a star.
We had dinner here on 10/13/2014. We had gnocchi, pork belly to start, I had the bone in rib eye and my wife had the fishermans grill per the recommendation of our server Donnie. For sides we had potato puree and fingerling potatoes. Everything was great, I thought the highlight dish was the fingerlings, had just the right amount of parmesan and the truffle was right on not overpowering, everything blended well together. But the service (server Donnie) was over the top. Great job Donnie !!! Highly recommended !!!
The food was great, the environment was also great. The only issue I had was we were here for my moms wedding dinner. The waiter seated us upstairs next to Mr Hugh Heffner wannabe. He was in his 70s had 5 young asian girls at his table and it was very irritating and uncomfortable for my mom. These prostitutes need to get a real job! Other than that it was wonderful after they left, the waiter matched up wines accordingly. The sticky toffee was out of this world!
Wowwwwww and wowwwww, i was like... i can talk to my steak. I was talking to my steak and forgot all my friends who came with me. Wowwww.....
No one does Beef Wellington like Gordon Ramsey!!!  This would be our 3rd Gordon Ramsey restaurant, 1st in the U.S. But the other 2 were in London...and He never disappointed us yet!  My husband and I visited here on our last annual trip to Vegas for our anniversary and this is where we choose to celebrate our night!  Gordon Ramsey Steak is located in the Paris Hotel. Very nice ambience...  We dressed up knowing this would be a fine dining experience.  Upon entering what catches your eye is their very unique light fixture in the middle of the dining room which was explained to us as the strokes Gordon Ramsey takes when he makes his infamous beef Wellington, Hubby being a major Fan had to order it...again (he tried it in London).  We were seated in a very roomy booth.  We were handed an Ipad as a drink menu.  After ordering our drinks the waiter comes over with a tray showing us the different cuts of beef to choose from.  I ended up ordering a bone-in Rib Eye, which next time I'll have to remember to ask the price because I think that bone itself costs  an extra $50-60... Don't get me wrong the food was Delicious!!!   Just wasn't prepared when I saw our bill.  Lucky I wasn't the one paying lol ;P  The sides are ordered ala carte.  We ordered the cream spinach and fingerling potatoes.  Hubby had the beef Wellington.... My rib eye was cooked perfectly,  it was huge!  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We really enjoyed our romantic dinner.  Service was great, very attentive, our hostess was even nice enough to take our picture on our way out.  We will continue to try out all his restaurants!
Best cut of meat in town. All the sides are good. The staff was informative about the dishes and made pleasant conversation. Been here several times and always send out of town friends here. Never heard one bad complaint yet.
I have been here twice and I have been impressed both times.  The beef wellington is worth it and for appetizer try the pork belly. If you're in vegas this is a must do at least once.
My review will be a bit strange because something strange happened on our visit to this place.. . I will start this by saying that it's not the restaurant's fault, and they handled the situation as well as they could have.. . Unfortunately, my side of the table where we were seated was one long bench, so you feel more connected to the other tables beside you. This is bad because a man at the table next to us had a bit too much wine to drink, and then threw up in his napkin. He then put his napkin down on the bench beside me and I actually saw the contents (this is how I knew he threw up since the whole thing was fairly discreet up to this point). It was so awkward... my husband saw him throwing up but did not mention it to me because he did not want me to feel sick, but then I saw the napkin contents and told my husband about it. Needless to say, we both felt sick and wanted to get the heck out of there. Unfortunately, we were only part ways through eating our steak! I left the restaurant right away since I really thought I was going to be sick. My husband followed close behind, after having a chat with management. We got 50% off the bill, which was a really nice gesture. One of those situations where it wasn't their fault, but it was their problem, I guess. . . We very much enjoyed our appetizers, and we were starting the enjoy the steak and sides when the incident occurred lol. . . One thing I did not like about the restaurant itself was how they bring out the meat cart. I get why they do it, but it turned me off a bit. I don't need to see that much raw meat, thanks. I know what a ribeye looks like. . . Not sure we'll be back again... I wouldn't want the gross memories spoiling an expensive dinner. It's a shame because the restaurant is definitely a good one.
I wasn't able to enjoy the full dining experience here, but did stop by the bar to enjoy a dessert. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a terrific dessert, and because I arrived just before the dinner rush there was no problem being promptly served bypassing the ladies checking people in and sitting myself directly at the bar.. . The dessert comes with a hot toffee sauce and a "stick" of a delicious ice cream. Make sure you try them all in a single bite.. . The interior of the restaurant is also excellently designed, making for a pleasurable experience.
Wow!!! Very upsetting. Got greeted great and that's where it ended. Sat us at our table. Waited over 7 mins and not one person even came over to our table. Got up and left. Told the nice girl at the front, she tried to get us back to sit down but I wasn't about to return after waiting. If you are going to charge that kind of money for your food, your service better be top notch. Not what I expected for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I know it's a Saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is. I hope this is not normal. I would like to try it again maybe sometime.
It was our second visit to this restaurant. The food is really great. The smoke tartar is really delicious and of course beef Wellington!!! I have to complain about noise level:( The music is too loud. Very hard to communicate with the servers:(
The restaurant is beautiful.  It all ends there.  The wait staff is so snobby and stuck up.  They have little to no knowledge of the different cuts of meat.  They also purposely mislead you to get you to spend more money.  The food was just ok, certainly nowhere near being worth the much too high prices.  There are far better steak houses on the striplike Prime, Capital Grille and The Steak House at Circus Circus.  This place is a total rip off, certainly deigned to be a tourist trap.  Stay away, trust me.
We dined here last night for my boyfriends birthday. The food was amazing. The service was also amazing. . . We ordered the chorizo stuffed lobster and the pork belly for appetizers. Both were equally delicious. . . For main courses I ordered the beef Wellington and my boyfriend ordered the bone in rib eye. I'm a total fan of Hell's Kitchen which is why I ordered the Wellington. It certainly did not disappoint. The meat literally melted in your mouth. . . While it was expensive, I felt it was worth every penny. I called ahead of time and ordered a dessert for his birthday. The sticky toffee pudding is spot on. ORDER IT! (If you have room) . . Great place to celebrate a special occasion!! We will be back!
I'm giving 3 stars for the food, I would have given more but the service (or more their attitude) brought my rating down. I had the Caesar salad to start and it was really nice, the mini scotch egg was a really nice touch. I then had the beef Wellington, it was pretty decent, it did come out a little reader than I would have liked but it was still very good. I finished off with the Chocolate creme pot which was small but very nice. Now for the service, although our server was attentitive I do not appreciate them making people feel stupid which is what ours did to members of our party by correcting when we ordered a cocktail but not by it's given name, it may sound petty but the way the server spoke to us leftus all a little shocked. Also when we ordered water we were not given the choice of having tap water just bottled water and just the general demeanor of our wait staff left us feeling disappointed with our visit. We were celebrating a friends birthday and it definitely spoilt the atmosphere of our evening. All in all I would recommend this restaurant but our waiter needs to sort his attitude!
Hard for me to find anything wrong with this spot as I and 4 buddies came in front out of a town and had Saturday night dinner.  Wonderful service, really great presentation and one of the best steaks I have had.  Started with smoked beef tartar - the unveiling presentation was memorable.  Anyways, everyone enjoyed and this was a great start to a good night.  We have tried many good, really good steakhouses in Vegas.  To me this was the class as SW, Strip Steak or Kraft Steak.
Must try:. American Kobe Rib Cap. Longbone chop . Toffee pudding. French press coffee. . Overall experience was awesome.. Mike the manager greeted us at the door and he was super friendly and made us feel welcome.  Thank you Mike!. Our server Charles was awesome. He knew the menu, described everything perfectly and gave us great tips.  You rock Charles!. . I would have given this place a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the $9 a bottle charge for still water. Really??!! We didn't know that we were being charged for two bottles??  Not cool Gordon!  . . We started our culinary journey with an assortment of bread. Everything was delicious.  The pancetta bread was the best of the four varieties.  The butter was topped with sea salt and gave it a nice little punch and added texture. Nice touch Gordon!. . Charles surprised us with a little something to open our palate. The Amuse Bouche - scotch is a soft boiled quail egg over a bed of red wine braised cabbage.  The egg had a slightly crunchy shell and the yolk was a perfect consistency. The cabbage cut right through the fatty protein and gave it a nice clean crisp finish. Amazing!. . The four of us ordered 3 steaks and shared. It was still too much and we had leftovers. We ordered all steaks medium rare and all had a nice pink center.  The American kobe rib cap was our favorite. It had a nice char with a crispy flaky layer. We cut through it like butter. The meat had a different texture to the other steaks.
I want to give 5 stars but something was just lacking. Definitely not our server, Ted. He was excellent. Made us feel very welcome, offered excellent suggestions, was there when we needed him and just an overall, friendly, likable guy. I think maybe because we were put in an upstairs room, away from all the action of the main restaurant, in kind of an odd table, maybe that's what it was? Or maybe because I was not "blown away" by my steak. Here's what we had and my take on it:. . Crab soup: Delicious. Not a heavy, cream base, it was a bit like a bisque, had excellent flavor, plenty of crab.. . Carpaccio appetizer: I enjoyed it, but it was not the best. I would probably skip and try something different.. . Rib cap: it was suggested by Ted since we were leaning towards the bone-in ribeye. So glad we tried it, best cut of meat. Very tender with a really nice flavor, I would definitely order it.. . Prime New York Strip: it was just ok. They did cook it a perfect medium rare, so no complaints there, but definitely was not as tender or flavorful as the rib cap. For what I paid, I would have expected way better. I added the butter poached lobster tail to it, it was standard. And small :/. . Sides: Baked potato: wow, just a darn good baker, and plenty for two people. . Mac and cheese: yeah, I know, we went on starch overload here, so probably should have tried the Brussels sprouts or I thought the okra looked interesting. It was a little heavy on the truffle oil. It was definitely good, but I've actually had better at other places. . . Dessert: Um, I have to jump on the bandwagon here...sticky toffee pudding...DONE! you will never have anything else like it. I'm pretty sure I've since had dreams about it. . . Nice touches: the French pressed coffee and the presentation it comes with, Amaretto, Bailey's and Chambord frozen spoons if you are into that. I just like mine plain with cream, it was excellent.. . We had a great time, thanks to the awesome Ted, as well as the other people who served us that evening. I don't think the restaurant is pretentious or snooty, we did not encounter any of that. But, would I ever go back for dinner, probably not. I could get equally good steaks in my opinion over at Mastros in Crystals. However, would I come in for a night cap of sticky toffee pudding and coffee, absolutely.
Delish!   Go hungry and don't order to much. My husband and I ordered the Kobe sliders & pork belly for  appetizer's.  Yum! For dinner we both ordered the beef wellington and omg so yummy. HUGE portion and we both got a side (baked potato is the size of my fore arm and the Mac & cheese super yummy),  we had so much in leftovers crazy!  No room for dessert but maybe we will go back tonight .  We had a 9pm reservation and were a bit nervous about dress code but we wore nice jeans and fit in just fine.
i must admit we had some anxiety about dining at gordon ramsey's steakhouse, particularly after eating at his burger spot (which was awful). so despite our misgivings we kept our reservation and were glad we did.. . this place was awesome! the beef wellington was off the charts as was my steak. the pork belly was also exceptional as was the lobster soup. service was very attentive and the atmosphere was relaxing albeit a bit different from your fathers steakhouse. . . enjoy
Best steak on the planet! I indulged on the ribeye cap, asperagus and baked potato. Can't go wrong here, just be prepared for $100 per person- not including appetizer or dessert.
Great service. They are very accommodating. The steak, outstanding. The American Wagyu Rib Cap Steak is excellent. It melts in your mouth. The special worchestire sauce compliment the steak well. The add foie gras give it good texture. The foie gras at Botero is better prepared though. Would recommend this place to anyone.
Everyone should try the season tasting menu for once, only 2000 customers will  be served. The best part is that you will receive an autograph from Gordon Ramsay ( Only 2000 will be accompanying with the tasting menu ). I will also recommend you order some dishes on the a la cart menu as  well since I feel hungry less  than an hour after I  have eaten...
