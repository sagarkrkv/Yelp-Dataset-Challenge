The inside is a "mix" of heaven and hell. I love the design and the concept of both sides. I wasn't granted my seat request even though the restaurant wasn't full at all.  The drinks were perfect.  I wasn't very hungry but everything I did eat was fantastic.  The waiter, Randy, was a gem and really much nicer than I imagined at this restaurant. The bred basket which I normally avoid came with peanut butter... Butter with peanuts in it-fantastic. The only reason I eat bread is it has PB on it. And yes, the view is amazing.
Mike is Awesome! He made sure to explain every dish from start to finish! From my experience when you're offered a comp at most dining establishment service tends to slip down. Mike however made sure we were taken care of beginning to finish. The cod and gnocchi was AMAZING. My girls ordered the taste menu and the dessert was the best thing ever.. . . Mike- you will be half of the reason I come back to mix. Otherhalf? The amazing cod of course ;)
Love this place, its a bit spendy but well worth it.. . The views on top of Mandalay Bay are captivating. . I had the steak with foie gras, it was delicious.  First time I had foie gras since they don't serve it in Cali anymore.. . Tuna Tar Tar was excellent and the dessert was delicious, I def recommend going with the prix fixe menu, you cant go wrong, just bring a credit card with a fat limit!
Atmosphere is 5 star.. view was 5-star... Food was 5 star but on this night service was one star ...hence the two. To start off The hostess accommodated our request for another table which was appreciated. Once we sat.... we were in no man's land. as the servers flew by our table it became comical to watch water being served all around us, then bread. The sommelier continued to walk tables with that look that was "I'm doing my job but not really looking at your table"  we had showered I promise and were smiling etc.. I swear I didn't have my middle finger on display. after 15 minutes of waiting we were approached. I get busy and understand the issues at times in a restaurant but with the reputation of Mix and soooooooo many restaurants to choose from in Vegas I would expect more.
Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever had. The $90 prix fixe menu was incredible and worth every penny. . . Our server, Randy, only made the meal that much better. You could tell he works as a server, but he's a chef in his own right. He did an awesome job accommodating us, considering I got the prix fixe menu and my mom had an entree and side. He timed it right and was extremely knowledgeable about all the food.. . Every single thing on the prix fixe menu was amazing. Every item was unique enough to make me think, and though I probably wasn't able to fully appreciate the presentation, it slapped me in the face with flavor I couldn't misunderstand. The lamb dish was the best I've ever had. Dessert kept coming...3 items that were ridiculously good!. . My mom had the cod and it was a huge portion with unbelievable flavor. She had a $9 side with the cod ($36) and it was plenty of food. These prices are REASONABLE when you're on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay.. . BONUS. Randy took the time to explain that MIX is one of the few restaurants in Vegas that actually serves PRIME beef, pastured meats, and most everything is organic. There are plenty of other places on the strip with prices this high and lower quality food so don't be fooled into thinking these prices are ridiculous. They're just not.
Please baby Jesus they need a new DJ for Friday nights.  It was this kind of like weird fast techno remixes of popular songs. ....we tried so hard to get the people to dance and it just wouldn't happen.  O well.....
Cool spot but thought the menu was lacking. The Steak was just ok. Service was pretty good. Over all it was good but don't think I'd return. I think the view was the best part.
I love the mix restaurant, but the service in the lounge is lousy. Other than the regular menu food at the restaurant, every thing is extremely over priced. Let me be clear, go to the restaurant side and enjoy one of the very best dinning experience in Vegas. If you go to the mix lounge, you will not be getting much value (even if you have lots of cash), it's poor service and some of the menu are not very good. This is now my second experience at the mix, and I don't think that I will be back again.
