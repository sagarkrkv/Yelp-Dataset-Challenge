DO NOT stay at this hotel if you expect quality service, quality surroundings and a quality stay.  I booked this hotel for a quick getaway with my Granddaughter.  The first thing she noticed when we checked into our worn room was the "intimacy kit".  I have stayed in tons of hotels thruout the years, but this was a first.  Then we went down to the Pink Taco for dinner.  We arrived around 6:30 PM, BEFORE the partying really gets started.  There were lots of available tables at that time, but the hostess thought it would be a good idea to seat a group of middle aged, DRUNK men right next to us.  Great.  They scared my Granddaughter and we left. By the way, the prices at the Pink Taco are outrageous and the food is awful.   Save some money and step up your game - go to Taco Bell!  I will NEVER stay here again and will recommend the same to my friends.  Mandaly Bay here we come!
Not a bad place to visit, I choose to come here because sometimes I like to do things away from the busy strip, so this is one of my fav low key spots, I like playing the tables here, I do fairly well here, rehab is the pool here so you always see people coming and going to the pool. The cafe is right out side, So getting a nice late bite to eat is very close, oh and walking to and from the strip isn't far at all..
Three of us got a room for one night last month.  The hotel has 11 floors; we were in room 1083.  We discovered at midnight that the penthouse directly above our room has a bowling lane.  Google it.. It sounds exactly like you would think.  After much back and forth, they comped our room.  I'm amazed they put a room under that suite.  Clueless or greedy, we won't be back.. Stay away from the 10th floor.
Circle bar in the lobby of hard rock has a dome shape and the acoustic ceiling lets you here conversations from across the bar. Great drinks. Culinary drop out has the best food in Vegas and the suites allow for an almost sound proof room. It blows my mind every time I go to hard rock hotel.
Greetings from the Paradise Tower. My room is so dark, so very, very dark.  I mean like dungeon dark.  I want to shave my legs so I can go to the pool but I'm terrified that I'll bleed to death because the bathroom is darker than the rest of the room.  I'll have to use the flashlight on my iPhone somehow.  Everything is black and red and gray, but the towels are typical hotel white.  The clash is actually comical.. On a brighter note, the bed is so very comfortable with wonderful fluffy pillows.. . I'm back to edit this review because I need to tell you about the Pool.  The pool situation increases the creepiness factor of this hotel by about a hundred percent. . Here we go, I'll try to keep this short.. First attempt: my husband and I tried to get to the pool through a row of glass doors near our elevator bank.  Security stopped us and told us we couldn't enter this way.  He gave us directions for finding the entrance, turns out you have to go through the parking garage (ugly).  We finally find it and are told by more security guards that we can't bring our backpack which has our books and sunscreen and water and other harmless stuff.  Back to Dracula's lair (our room) unpack the backpack, take what we need, head back down. This time we find out we need our ID's to prove we are 21.  We're both in our 40's.  So, back up to the depressing cave of a room, get our ID's and back down through the ugly garage.  Here comes the fun part, after make it through the door after showing ID, we both get pat downs like we've never had in our lives, not at airports or concerts, not ever.  I basically was given a breast exam.  You would have thought we were going to visit someone in prison.. Here's what we found when we cleared security, pool #1 was overcrowded loud and obnoxious.  Pool #2 was less loud but just as overcrowded, not a lounge chair to be had. Pools #3 and #4 were CLOSED!. We took a quick unsatisfying swim, towelled off and went back to our evil, depressing room.  Then we made it up to ourselves by visiting other awesome hotels and spending time and money there instead.
I love the Hard Rock, it has the best pool for partying. No kids, just adults and good music. Good mix up girls and guys.. . The nicest unpretentious place in Vegas.. . Rooms are modern, clean, and big.
Wish I could give this place negative 5 stars. One of the few places in Vegas where I can play slots for over and hour without being offered a drink. The entire cocktail staff fails so miserably at their job I wonder how they are still employed. . Playing at the bar is not any better as I sat for about 10 minutes playing dollar video poker before even being acknowledged. . It's an astonishment how this place is empty all the time with all this first class customer service.
Stayed at Hard Rock for the first time recently, and it was the bomb.com.  I'd been wanting to stay there, as it seemed fun with its rock n roll vibe.  . . Upon checking in, the front desk clerk was super friendly.  First thing she told me was she loved my hair, that I had perfect curls (no complaints there).  She then upgraded us to a room in the Paradise tower without us asking.  She let us know it was their most recently remodeled tower.  She was also super helpful with info about restaurants and the free shuttle to the strip.  . . The room itself was quite nice.  It was on a higher floor, very modern, clean, and had a huge window.  Yes, we were directly overlooking the parking garage, but the larger view was the Vegas strip, absolutely beautiful at night.  The armoire cabinet was a bit scratched up, could use a touch up.  But overall, everything was very clean and our bed was very comfortable.  Yes, the lighting could be better.  It was a bit confusing, and took us some playing around with the switches to figure out which switch worked for which lamp.  I also had to do my makeup by the window, because the lighting in the bathroom was practically non-existent.  The hotel could benefit from investing in brighter bulbs... . . During the day on the weekends, the lobby was bustling with very attractive people, many half-clothed headed to rehab pool.  We were there toward the end of the season, so the lobby wasn't obnoxiously crowded.  . . Liked their Lucky's 24 hour cafe.  We stopped there one evening around 2:00 am to grab a late night snack.  The food was decent, the service great, and people watching insane (saw several drunken fools, was impressed with the patience of the servers in dealing with the ridiculousness).  . . On our last evening, we decided to gamble at the hotel so we could head up to the hotel room when we got tired.  The casino itself was tiny, and there was only one cocktail waitress that was impossible to order drinks from.  Eventually we headed to the circular bar in the main casino to grab drinks.  This too, made for some amazing people watching.  Between watching several "working girls" do their thing, and some old fool literally drunkenly fall of his bar stool, there was plenty of entertainment.  . . Our bartender was great.  A funny guy with glasses, he was attentive, and allowed me to taste one of the wines before ordering (they don't have a wine list, have a limited selection of wines at the that bar).  The wine was decent.  I later ordered a Patron Espresso, which they didn't have, but the manager overheard me ordering it and offered to check their other bar to see if they carried it.  He took a while to come back (probably distracted with whatever shenanigans were going on), so I ordered a second glass of wine.  He eventually did show up with the Patron, and offered me the drink for free.  Sweet.  They did have one bartender who was kind of a jerk, practically threw the matches at me when I asked for some.  But thankfully, the other bartender was great and we were able to order mostly from him.  . . I could see how this place might not be for everyone.  I saw a girl puking her guts out by the taxis.  On one evening, the elevator we took smelled like vomit and had a suspicious looking stain on the floor.  We arrived back at our hotel around 2:30 am and the casino was packed to the brim. This is not a family friendly hotel, but frankly, I don't think Vegas is all that family friendly to begin with.  (With all the sex and debauchery flying around, I would never bring my kids here if I had any...). . Disappointed that the Pink Taco only has happy hour on particular days of the week.  We love the Pink Taco in LA, and were looking forward to grabbing some appetizers before heading out for the evening  Also, the ventilation in the rooms isn't always great.  Some idiot decided to smoke outside our room, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, and our entire room reeked of smoke for a while.  The shuttle only rides once an hour and until 5PM, and the max passenger seating is 20 ppl.  So, unless you want to cab it everywhere, I do suggest you rent a car.  . . But, all in all, we loved it here.  The scene was great, we felt we fit right in.  I'll def be back.
This is the first time I stayed in  Las Vegas and we booked a 6 day stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. The check in went very smoothly. We were on our way to our room in no time. The room was very neat and clean. The view we had on the 4th floor looked right out onto the pool area where the host the Rehab parties. The room was spacious. The bathroom need more lighting. Over all the room was large and more than enough room. The Hotel also houses several places to eat, a small shop for alcohol, drinks and snacks. The Hard Rock also has valet parking. You can also go to the valet to have them call an taxi or limo for you.  The walls and area is adorned with music memorabilia. The casino has table games as well as slots placed around the main floor. Mr. Lucky's 24/7 restaurant is a great deal for meals. They are open 24/7 (hence the name) and the prices are fair. We ate they quite a bit and always had a good meal. They also feature  Sports book lounge if you'd like to place a bet on just about any sporting event. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. All in all we had a great time at Hard Rock Hotel and work stay here again.
So I'm starting to think I should have read these reviews before I booked my room that I had this past weekend. The location is decent. Not too far away from anything but not too close to anything. However, the surrounding neighborhood is sketchy. Like wow, totally gonna get robbed soon kinda sketchy. Our room was decent but pretty dirty. There was a nice amount of dust on all of their toiletries, food and water that were available for purchase and the nightstand was both sticky and covered in dust. The girls at the front desk were nice enough but the bell boys looked annoyed and were rude when I tried to ask them a couple of questions about where our room was cause I had no idea where I was going. So it wasn't a horrible stay but it was filthy and that's totally unacceptable. I was never greeted when I came into contact with hotel staff and was treated like a burden when they spared a few moments of their precious time to talk to me.
This was probably the worst experience I have had while staying in Vegas. Luckily it was just one night and the reason I even stayed there was to be able to get concert tickets. . The staff is rude when and if they even acknowledge you. The rooms are not near the quality they advertise and seem dirty and not maintained well. The toilet was stained and dirty. Outside the window on a ledge was a large collection of garbage. . . The minibar is weight sensitive and the prices are ridiculous as well. The price for anything within the casino or hotel is way too high, it's like because of their horrible location they think they can make you pay twice as much. If you must stay go across the street to the CVS for anything you may need. . . The staff was plain out rude. And the girl at check out tried to make us pay a higher rate when we checked out than what we were told when we booked and the price when we had checked in. She went and spoke with her manager and  then spoke to us as it was clearly there in the contract and our fault. When I pointed out that if it was in the contract that she could see, why did the two previous people we had spoke to gave us the lower price? She had no answer and offered no apology then she said wait a minute and left to talk to the manager for the second time who never bothered to even make an appearance and came back to find out we were charged incorrectly and she never once apologized. When we mentioned how disappointed with the hotel we were she just ignored us as if nothing happened. . . To top it off there is no hot tub unless you rent a cabana. The pools are only open until dark if they open at all. And the staff won't even acknowledge you exist even if you are wondering looking lost which is fairly easy to do. It may be different if you are a female in a bikini as it was mostly male staff. . . Then as a kicker the display of Nikki Stixx's chopper they call it a "Cusom Hardtail" unless I am missing a brand or style I'm assuming they meant custom.
This is our second stay in one year.  I will review both stays, as we loved it so much we went back!  Our first visit we stayed in the HRH Tower.  It was beautifully decorated, the view was great over the pool.  A little loud during the day with the pool music, so a little hard to take a nap.  But overall a very great location.  The second visit we stayed in The Paradise Tower.  We had a corner room with views that could not be beat.  Amazing.   The walk was a bit longer to the casino floor and the crowd on this side seemed a tad rougher.  We will book The HRH Tower for our next visit.. The bartenders were incredible.  Phillip and Nick our all time favs.  Most everyone we came in contact with were very nice.  The center bar has a very trippy echo that stumped us the first couple days, but then figured out how to enjoy someone's conversation from the other side of the bar.  Pretty funny.. Security in this hotel always seems to be comforting.  Nice work HR.. You can definitely see some wear and tear in the hotel, but over all a very nice stay.  . The pole dancers over the gaming tables are rad.  A show while you are gambling.  Those dancers were so strong and fun to watch.. The dealers are really nice as well.  Most all wanted you to win and are more than happy to help and chat.  We played BJ and craps most everyday.  The pit bosses were very friendly.. Check-in and out is super easy and welcoming.. We have rented a cabana at the nirvana pool twice.  A great way to spend a day if the weather is nice.. I will rate the restaurants separately, but just need to mention that we have eaten at all establishments.  Culinary Drop out we visited multiple times.  It was that good and fun.. And finally, one observation we made is how nice looking most people are in the casino.  There seemed to be a steady stream of 25-60 year old.  This hotel is not filled with old people or families with kids.  A perfect spot of the 40-something.  We will most definitely be back.  Thanks for the fun.
The checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked. No ventilation, as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room. Then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places. Not recommended.
This hotel exceeded our expectations when we were disappointed in our first two rooms.  They moved us to a 3rd and took care of us. Bell hop to magmt. And front desk Ariel I think was 1st class.... . . I won't stay anywhere else now   . Speakers blown but that is minor in a suite like this and a fridge would be nice for insulin so I had to break the cooler rule but we don't drink so don't worry... thanks everyone for making my fiance ' s birthday a hit... my son is jealous over at PH.  . . Oh and club manager at front desk treated me great even though I look rough.  Diabetic issues ugh!
Really enjoy this just-off-the-strip hotel!  We arrived a little later in the evening, so there was a super short wait for check-in.  Ariel was the agent who helped us, and he was great!  He noticed it was my birthday when he was looking at my license, and he put us in the HRH Tower, which is an all-suite wing of the hotel.  Awesome!  Thanks Ariel!. . The room was awesome.  We were on the 3rd floor, which gave us a wonderful view of a roof and the parking garage ;), but who are we to complain?  The room was about 700-sq-ft, and had a separate living and bedroom area.  The beds were SUPER comfy!  The living room had a neat touchscreen music system on the wall, which was built in with all different genres of music that played through a speaker by the TV.  You could also plug in your own device, which was a nice touch.  The bathroom was great!  Double sinks, and a separate bathrub (huge) and shower (huge).  The shower had an awesome rainfall showerhead.. . We did not check out too much of the property, but the separate check-in area for the HRH Tower was a nice touch, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.. . The only downside was the confusion of the light system in the bathroom.  It was SO dark in there the first night, and we could barely see anything.  Obviously we could have called the front desk, but we were too tired.  We also couldn't figure out how to use the rain showerhead either, but the other showerhead was still great.  We did go by the front desk the second day, and the agent let us know that there was a master switch by the front door that controls the light in the bathroom.  Seems a little poorly designed and confusing.  He also sent up engineering to look at the showerhead, and they left us a note explaining how to use it.  Great followup!
