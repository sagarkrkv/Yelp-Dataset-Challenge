I went with some friends.  They were very nice and homey.  . We came on a Sunday, and as we sit there it was getting busy. They are very popular with the locals.  Looks like business is good
Idk about this place it's good but I went with 12 people and honestly after a couple of hours I'm still hungry.  They served us bugs, shrimp, mussels, clams, snow crab, fries, calamari.  The mussels clams and crab were excellent.  The shrimp sucked the crawfish tastes just like it does when my la boys bring us some.  But considering our 12 people having a 400 dollar bill.  Not what I expected.  The service was great food over all was lacking for me.  It's a place you should try with a large group.
Such amazing flavors!. . We stopped in for lunch and tried the crawfish and the shrimp. We went for very mild spice which was great, but still left a nice lingering burn, and tried the hot n juicy & the garlic butter.  Both were excellent - quite literally finger licking good.  This is a messy experience, but that is all part of the fun.. . A great meal to share with a group of friends so everyone can try a bit of something new.
I was very disappointed in this place. All the food tastes exactly the same. I couldn't even tell s difference in the texture between the shrimp and the crab..  Once we ordered they brought out the good in big plastic bags, steaming hot. However, there are no sides included, and limited sides to add on even if you choose to..  It didn't get one star because Laura was great. She kept our completely flat sodas refilled, and checked back on us frequently..  Also, the corn fritters were delicious. I would say stop by and ask to sit in Laura's station, get the fritters and one kind of seafood, a beer or water, and if you're still hungry go next door for desert or up the street to Ronald's Donuts..  Really overpriced for what it is, I think.
Out of the 3 locations in Las Vegas, this is my favorite. I feel as if it is the cleanest with the friendliest staff. I also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten HnJ. The other location on Spring Mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what I had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha The bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! After eating, I always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.. . For the food, . The crab is usually on point for me. It is cooked all the way through. There was ONE time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. I usually get the garlic butter flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! The hot n juicy flavor is good as well. I also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. The shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. The oysters are always yummy and I have yet to get a scrawny puny one. Their cajun fries are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. I have not eaten the crawfish, but I hear its good. I feel like its too much trouble to go through ALL THAT peeling for a tiny piece of meat. . . You can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. I like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. You can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage. . . All in all, I prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. I would definitely come pay this place a visit .
Finally made it here and we will definitely be back. We had the Cajun Calamari, 1 lb of shrimp with potatoes and sausage in the Hot n Juicy sauce spicy, and 1lb Snow Crab legs in the garlic sauce. You really need to add the sausage to one of your orders. They were out of the Crawfish but the shrimp in my opinion was the best deal for the price.
I love the hot n juicy sauce from this place. It makes everything so much better. Spice level is not as hot as advertised. At least not for me. . . The shrimp was good. Clams and king crab legs were excellent. No wait either on a Friday night at 7pm, which was the best part.
Went here for my first time last night. After hearing from so many friends, family, and coworkers how awesome this place was I decided to go and take some family from out of town. I am originally from the east coast so I am a bit spoiled on GREAT seafood. All the people telling me to go here are all from California or some other pacific coast state. Now I can understand why someone from the desert or west coast would like this place because they don't know any better but let me tell you, THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL. I could not believe how bland the seafood was especially with all the rave reviews of the sauces this place uses. The sauces are all extremely watered down and they do not penetrate to the actually food itself just the shells. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crawfish (which we were told were not fresh but frozen!!!), a dozen oysters(SO BAD), and calamari. We tried various sauces and spice levels and we just agreed that this place was a lot of hype for nothing. I have been to the Gulf many times and have had the type of food they are TRYING serve and the food here is just not even close. I did ask the manager where the seafood comes from and he told me ASIA mostly(FYI, seafood restaurants that get their shellfish from Asia are normally awful plus it's the cheapest possible shellfish on the market!!!). I guess I understand why the location is in China town and why most of the people at the restaurant were Asian. In addition to the food tasting awful, the service was very poor. Staffed with a lot of girls who seemed to be working their first serving job. We had to light signal flares just to get another beer. All the wait staff was talking about some party after work that they couldn't wait to get to and they kept grouping together to discuss rather than tend to the customers and lots of people were frustrated. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see how people who have never had decent seafood (mostly from buffets) would love this place as it's just like people who say the best sushi is at Ra Sushi because they just don't know any better. But if you have been to cities on the Gulf of Mexico and have had Gulf seafood or are from the east coast and have had great seafood then please pass this place up because all your friends telling you how awesome this place is have never truly had awesome seafood.
