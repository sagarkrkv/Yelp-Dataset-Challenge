We go every year with friends while in Vegas. Love the atmosphere and live entertainment. It's a nice change from the standard issue Vegas neon lights. Well worth a short cab ride to get there!
I've been to Germany, and I've been to the original Haufbrauhaus.  The atmosphere at this location is great but the food is horrible. The first time I was there for lunch - this was at least 7 years ago, their mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and their saurcraut was fresh out of a can and not properly rinsed.  Just went for their Oktoberfest  celebration. I was excited and hopeful that their food had changed.  Nope. Ordered a large pretzel  to share.  Pretzel came out cold and a bit hard. I was excited tho for their currywurst  since I have been craving it since I left Germany. I've had about 8 currywursts in my life and this was the most disgusting currywurst ever. How can you mess up a street cart food like currywurst?! Also they cut up an American hotdog and placed it on top of my fries  for some unknown reason. I'm not ever going back.  I can get my fix of good German beer from the local liquor stores and if I am craving German food I'll go to the Berlin Cafe.
We were here Friday for part of the Frozen Fury weekend. Our reservations were ready and on time. The server was very polite and got all of our order right. The atmosphere is awesome, especially since it was filled with other Kings fans. Got the Das Boot (2 liter) and filled it with the Oktoberfest, which was delicious. I ordered the chicken sausage to eat, but after a total of 3 liters of beer I can't give an honest, sober review of the food, but I loved it. There were ladies walking around with $5 shots and you get spanked with a paddle. She hits hard! Definitely looking forward to next year!
I really wanted to love the Hofbrauhaus as we just moved from Germany to Vegas and was craving a German experience.  We won't be back.   It was not authentic at all and nothing like the place in Munich.. . I called first to be sure they had their great alcoholfrei biers as they do Munich since I'm pregnant. They said yes.  When I got there they acted confused and had one option in a bottle, not the usual hefeweizen, etc.  The waitress apologized for the not-so-smart hostesses that answered the phone.  That was super aggravating!  We ordered the jager schnitzel and it wasn't schnitzel at all but a dried out pork chop that I been Americanized.  German food doesn't come with so many toppings or garnishes and the pork is pounded thin.  It was also cold...and pricey!  We had a reservation for 4, but two were running late.  They only gave us space at a table for two.. . The keg tapping for Oktoberfest was also lackluster.  Maybe if you haven't been to Munich you'd find it mildly entertaining. If you have, keep those memories and skip the vegas location.
The food was delicious.  The crispy potatoes pancakes with the sauce are so yummy. The braised beef with cabbage and sauteed vegetables are juicy and plump. The hurricane drink is a panty dropper. You dont notice how strong it is until your already gone. Lol.. great food. Great service...
Be warned they are "open"  until 11 but won't serve past 10:15. Took a cab all the way there knowing they closed at 11 justto be turned away at 10:15. Very disappointing! I thought this was Vegas?  If you don't allow anyone in past 10:15 list that as closing time! Who turns away thirsty people?  Update your information. Waste of time and cab ride.
Advertise that they close at 11pm but when we showed up at 10:15 they informed us that they were no longer letting anyone in and they "technically" close at 10:15pm- stop letting people in and stop serving beer. BS! If you close at 10:15pm Pease let people know so they do not waste cab fare getting to your establishment. . . Never coming back...btw, I lived in Germany for two years...this never would have been tolerated in Deutschland.
Fun environment.  Good service.  Terrible food.
This place is great. Gave 4 stars cause of Anthony the manager. Anthony told us last night at 10:25pm that we must drink up, and get out because the "automatic alarms" were going to go off. Other staff was just staring at us dumb founded. Anthony is bad for business.
Bomb dot com!
This is a fun place to go and meet up with family and friends, and enjoy the good German food, varieties of different beers, great entertainment. A great tourist destination.
We had our wedding reception here. We had about 30 people and it ended up being buffet. The food was wonderful and the staff were prompt and nice! The pork roast was amazing and so tender!!!!. . Originally we requested the beer hall, but it was insane being Oktoberfest, so they moved us to the gardens. I actually think this was a better idea and they gave us a big screen tv to watch the festivities in the beer hall. . . Due to a family issue, we initially had 58 people we contracted for, but it ended up being 31 people instead. Although the contract was written that we would lose money on guests 31-48, they offered us some options that made us feel a lot better about our experience. . . I would definitely suggest this restaurant for large groups and wedding receptions. It was so much fun!!. . Big thanks to Karen K who helped us arrange everything!
HATED IT!  We were invited to a "family dinner" with my daughter's new inlaws who were visiting from out-of-town.   We normally try to avoid anything near the strip, but we accepted the invitation..   The place was a freakin' zoo!   Jam packed and extremely loud!   We couldn't even hear the people sitting next to us, so having a conversation was impossible..   The food wasn't that great, and overpriced.  Small portions..   Service was horrible.  There were about 25 of us and we had 2 waitresses.   Our food arrived..... however several of our guests did not receive their food until about 15 minutes later!    .   The best part of the night was watching my new son-in-law get "spanked" by the German dominatrix.   Yes... that was fun!.   I guess we're just old fuddy-duddies because we did not enjoy the LOUD atmosphere at all.   We will never go back.
I'm not a huge fan of the food at the Hofbrauhaus, but it has the best beer in town and an atmosphere that can't be duplicated. (Unless, perhaps, you're in Bavaria. And even there, I doubt you'll hear a guy mixing traditional German songs with reggae and the "Hogan's Heroes" theme song.). . My husband and I met some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We arrived at noon, and the place was nearly empty. By the time we left at 1:30, however, the place was rocking, no doubt due to the entertainment (a one-man band) that began at 1. It was also extremely loud, so if you're looking to have an intimate meal, this is NOT your place! If you're looking for a good, raucous time, give the Haus a whirl.. . As I said, the food is not the draw here; it's the beer. We each had a liter of the Oktoberfest, which is a nice, smooth lager. As much a I enjoyed this seasonal offering (and it was the main reason we all decided to meet here for lunch), I was craving the Hofbrau Original, so I got myself a 0.5-liter mug as well. So tasty! And so pricey -- $17 for the Oktoberfest, and $8 for the Original. (Hey, I said it was tasty. I didn't say it was cheap!). . My friends split a jumbo pretzel, complete with sides of mustard, cheese spread, and liver pate. At around $17.50, this was one expensive appetizer. Although they enjoyed their app, my husband and I skipped straight to the entrees. I had the beer sausage (abratwurst), which was on "special" for $16, and he had his old standby, the leberkase, which is like an upscale grilled Spam loaf. (Sounds bad, but it's oh so good.) My friends had the beer sausage and the giant bratwurst sandwich, and they split of piece of Black Forest cake for dessert. Total damage for lunch (pre-tip): $190. Eek!. . There are two dining rooms in the building, and we've sat in both of them. On this occasion, the smaller, indoor beer garden was closed, so we sat in the large beer hall up front. There's usually some sort of entertainment going on, and at night this place can get REALLY loud -- especially during the popular keg-tapping events. So be forewarned. And you'll probably drop a lot of money, if our lunch bill is any indication. But if you're in the mood for a semi-authentic German experience (albeit by Vegas standards), the Hofbrauhaus is the place to go.
