If I could give this 6 stars. I would. This show was beyond amazing. The music of course rocked. I think I would see this again!!!. I just went to La Reve...and didn't feel that way. So this show is AH-mazing.
So you know the feels and goosebumps you get whenever you hear really amazing music? Well, I got those throughout the entire show.. . I didn't wait to buy the soundtrack at a normal store. I chose to pay the retail price. By choice. At the Beatles Shop. . . That's how much I loved it. . . I'm not normally a fan of remixes, but this is brilliant. Fantastic soundtrack that did not disappoint with their fabulous sound system. (It could also quite possibly be my most favorite album to listen to through a great set of headphones ever; you feel totally immersed. George Martin & son did not let down) . . There's not much I can say about the show without ruining it, but this was my first cirque du soleil show and it was totally worth the money. . . I could be speaking from a biased point of view cuz I'm quite hardcore when it comes to the Beatles. Like, that's my shit really. But speaking as a Beatles fan, to an outsider, I could either be overly biased or overly critical. Depends on how you look it. Either way, you're missing out if you don't experience this show at least once in your life.
I saw this show while in Vegas with my then boyfriend in Oct 2013 and we loved it. The music, the dancing, the acrobats......it was so exciting. We walked out of the theater and said "I want to see it again". We returned to Vegas in June 2014 to get married and went to see the show again. It was even better the 2nd time because we both said we saw things that we didn't see the first time.
Saw it for the second time last week. If you are "ehh it's ok" on Beatles music you will still like the show. If you love the Beatles, you will pee your pants in excitement. . . The theater is fairly small and even the back row of the cheap seats has a good view of the action. In fact, I think the cheap seats are better than up front, because they allow you to see more of the action, for half the price. . . Still, I'd pay full price to see this over and over again.
I will preface this by saying I am not much of a Beatles fan. Their music is good and I can appreciate it, but its not something I hold near and dear or seek out.  Most people that were here to see the show were beatles fans, which was fun, except for the lady that sang out loud to every song and couldn't stay within the her imaginary boundaries that the seat arms created.  . . I did enjoy the show, but at times it did get a little slow and kind of boring. When it picked up, it was kind of cool.  I am glad I saw it, but I wouldn't see it again and I'm not sure I would recommend it to a non-Beatles fan.
Tonight 16 Oct. 2014 was the second time that I've seen the Beatles LOVE show at the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas. This show is definitely worth seeing. The dancers, the aerial artists the music all come together in one flowing magical evening. If you get to see one show in Las Vegas I would highly recommend this one there are two shows every night except Tuesday and Wednesday.. Tickets range from $79 up to about 175. I think sitting higher is more advantageous as you get to see things take shape. However tonight we sat nine rows from the stage and that was very good as well.
Absolutely loved this show! I have referred to is many times as "life changing"! The choreography is flawless and their versions of the songs are perfection. The Blackbird cover gave me goosebumps!. . I knew the show was gonna be a winner the minute we crossed the threshold of the awesome entrance! For sure wouldn't recommend the drinks they serve out front, overpriced and yucky. Although the Beatles themed names were a nice touch.
I am not a Cirque fan. Truth be told I grew up in Canada and have seen many Cirque productions and they frankly scare me. The crazy clown/ juggling, Miming, high flying trapeze , acrobatic contortionist acts never appealed to me. Not one bit. But yet I found myself in love with LOVE.. . LOVE is a gorgeous interpretation of the songs of the Beatles. The production captures the spirit of the Beatles. It's visually stunning, and it envelops you, encircles you. It becomes overwhelming at points with the amount of action happening all around. You really have to sit back and take in the beauty of it all. Don't blink -you'll want to see it all. The sound and staging were spectacular. . . There isn't really a story so much as there are themes. It revolves around Beatles era references: the Cold War, beatles-mania,the 50's, the 60s, their crazy acid induced trips into Sgt Pepper territory and their foray into India are all referenced in a dazzling way. . . I particularly loved how they interpreted Black Bird, the yellow Submarine was amazing and surprising and of course, beautiful (especially viewed from the top). . I absolutely loved the interpretation of Here comes the sun. It was so beautiful. So moving. Thoroughly worth the price of admission. . Amazing. . Trust me you'll fall in LOVE too.
