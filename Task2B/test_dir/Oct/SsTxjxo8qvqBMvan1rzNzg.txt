I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews.  I guess people are more enamored by the experience than the actual food.  . . The decor is pretty cool; it's definitely much more interesting than the average 24 hour diner.  There's a photographer who goes around and takes pictures. But seriously, I'm not coming here for the decor at 3am; I'm coming because I need some food after a night out.  . . The food is extremely mediocre; I'd even say that it's below average in quality.  The portions are large however, but who cares how much you get when you can't eat something because it just doesn't taste good?. . I understand that this place isn't gourmet, but I definitely expect food that's at least on par with the average diner.  I'd rather go to Mickey D's to eat than this place.
Great sandwiches. And a ton of food.  Wasn't thrilled with their potato salad. Get fries instead.  Restaurant is kind of a kickback from old Vegas. Wait staff was friendly too.
What a fun place!! Cool decor and great food! Would be 5 stars but -1 for the service at the front area.  Had an hour wait on a Saturday but took longer because the receptionist forgot to call out our name.... Not sure why.. . We hung out in the bar area for drinks and enjoyed the inside fire place.. . When we finally got to the food, we ordered an omelette and steak/eggs.  Everything was really well seasoned and huge portions for the price.  5 stars for all of the food.  Must go! Highly recommended!
We decided to come here for breakfast on my actual birthday. My girl recommended this place and raved about how cool it was and couldn't believe I had never been there before. It reminded me of some 70's porn like that Mark Walberg flick I can't think of right now. Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean). . . We decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw). . I did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool. I kind of wish we sat on that side and enjoyed my bday breakfast but honestly, I just wanted to eat and head out to downtown to gamble.. . Overall, it was a cool experience to check out but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Especially when you have so many other cool spots to eat at in Vegas.. . . . OOO. 3 out of 5 Afros
The place was very retro, for sure. We went out on a Wednesday night at about 9pm. My husband and I both had great meals. I had the pancakes and eggs and sausage. The portions were huge, but I ended up having breakfast for the next day. He had a sandwich (I can't remember which one) and he enjoyed it very much. Other than a couple of surround tables' drama, we had a pretty nice dinner. We will definitely go back.
5 stars for consistently providing: great food, fast, friendly service, & uniquely beautiful atmosphere/ambiance. without a doubt, this peppermill is one of my favorite corners of not only vegas, but the world. in my opinion, peppermill/fireside is a must-see in vegas for locals & tourists alike. it's pretty, it's soooo, sooooo pretty!!!
The food was great can't complain but the service sucked  so bad disappointed in how the hostess weren't on top of seating people having to wait good 10 minutes to get seated then they sat us at table where it wasn't clean . I had ask them to wipe down the chairs at least so I can sit because it was full of food crumbs left from the other pervious people & the hostess looked at me  and said I don't see anything I literally had to point it out so they can clean it . And the waiter was not on top on the refills and checking in on us if we need anything . We had waited 15 minutes after we were done eating waiting for the waiter to bring our check and never did we got up and had to ask for our tab to pay.  By the way it was not busy at all . food great! service sucked!
Great food, good service, will always keep coming back. A true vegas staple. Always open, always good.
This place is Vegas tacky yet kitsch cool and the food, drinks and service was very good.. . Came here for what was meant to be late breakfast but ended up being early lunch.. . We ordered the crab cakes to get started and I have to say they were so damn good I could have just ordered more for my main meal.. However I ordered what was the best Ruben sandwich I have ever had in my life. . Was full of flavour and so big I could barely  eat half of it.. My boyfriend and his friend both got the pastrami sandwich which were both as big and my girlfriend had a burger.. The margarita  bomb we had to wash it down was super good and super strong... No complaints there!. Waitresses were very friendly and happy to assist.. Will be back for more next time I'm in Vegas!
We decided to try this place because there were bums passed out in front of the neighboring Denny's...This place is a trip, and a true Vegas gem!  The menu is literally a book (think Cheesecake Factory) with about anything you could think of up for grabs 24 hours a day!  You could see anything from a few girls passed out in their eggs, to folks doing business here at 3am- so the entertainment alone is priceless!  Our service was terrific, and the place has a fun funky feel with neon and floral everywhere!. . My dining partners had the NY Strip and Eggs, while I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict- a little pricy at 24.00 but hey, it's Vegas!
Love this place. Extremely well priced and has a great menu that makes you feel very homey. I'm a kid at heart so it has great chicken fingers and nice French toast. Love their cocktails as well they have a scorpion bowl that you might need a little help to polish off. Great place for anyone looking for something simple but good.
Out of all the years I've been coming to the Peppermill it's been the same ever since I love this place but tonight tonight for some reason there are about 15 to 20 beautiful knock dead gorgeous women here they don't know me from Adam or all they want to do is go out and partay I'm down for that taxi all later O
AWESOME food, people, and environment! They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner 24 hours a day! The portions are HUGE and the food is amazing!
Went here to order some late night breakfast. Can't f____g believe they charge extra to sub out cottage cheese for hash browns. I've traveled all over the country, and this is the first place I have had that does this.. . When you travel a lot, it's the little things that matter. I travel a lot, and while I can afford it, it's the spirit of the charge that befuddles me.
Was hesitant when I first walked in with the flamboyant decor and the questionable reviews.... however I was so surprised how wonderful the food was. . . I visited the establishment around 1130am on a Saturday. Service was good, food came out in a reasonable fashion - portions were huge!. . Definitely a must try in Vegas!
Part diner and part lounge, it's 24 hours of fun and games with a mixed crowd sure to give you characters for stories.  It's doesn't look like it's been remodeled since the 70's, or at least, it's been made to look like it so that part of it's charm.. . Food prices run a bit high but it's HUGE portions, 3-4 star in quality, and has a wide menu.. . I like it for various reasons; food is only partial.  Good for late night.
Our family and friends from out of town visited the Peppermill for dinner.    The staff was very accommodating with our two young children.  We generally need to order food for the boys as soon as possible in order to have things not melt down and the staff addressed it in less than two minutes.  The menu is classic family restaurant fare.  Solid, cooked fresh, and good.  Nothing we had was outstanding but just solid good food.  The ambiance is classic 70s ultramod.     Definitely will visit again.
Went around 10am on a Friday and the place was packed, wait was 30-45 minutes.  We went to the lounge and sat by the fire pit,  waitress came almost immediately for our drink order.  Me and my husband both order fruity drinks which were large and very good.  The lounge is nice to sit and take in the views of the all the neon lights and watch old rock videos that they play on the tvs.  When we went to get a second round we could not find a waitress.  When we got our table, service went quick.  I got Joes San Francisco special which is enough for 2 people and very good.  Husband got French toast ambrosia which was good and also a large portion.  Coffee was also good.
So many choices! No matter what you're in the mood for, pepper mill has it. Their menu is huge and has everything from breakfast to turkey dinners. Their drink options are extensive as well. . . The atmosphere is very different from most diners. It's very dark with neon and velvety purple colors. Very cool . . If you go, try the Belgian waffle it's really good. . . Also, their giant fruit platter is amazing. Like ENORMOUS and it comes with a loaf of AMAZING banana bread. You also get like 8 scoops of sherbet. . . A must try if you ask me.
One of the best diners in Vegas. Never had a bad drink or meal here. Plus the atmosphere is really inviting.
I've been to the Peppermill a few times, both the lounge and the diner sides. This last time was just bad. Initially we wanted to sit in the Lounge by the fire pit, but after 15 minutes of sitting at a dirty table and getting no service we had to get up and ask someone for menus. When we received the menus we decided to go to the diner side as there couldn't have been more than 10 choices that you are able to order in the lounge side. Okay, fine. We get to the diner side, the guy who seats us is a complete...I had to ask him to seat us! We table hopped to finally find one that wasn't a) by a bunch of loud obnoxious drunk kids or b) underneath a full blast AC going in October. After finding a table getting a waiter was our next struggle. A man walked by and asked if we had ordered, we said no and he just walked off. We were pretty confused as I thought no was a pretty universal word. When we finally got him to come back we waited quite a while for the less than mediocre food we were served (again, I ordered a burger). I get that this is a cool place to go if you're absolutely trashed and hungry in Vegas late at night, but NEVER EVER go here sober. Trust me, the food and the irritation isn't worth it. Ugh.
You better go there with an extremely huge appetite,  food is awesome, very attentive staff, I will hit it again when in Vegas
Seriously epic!  I love the atmosphere here.  It's neon, but quiet and the other lights are low, so even in the heat of the day, you feel calmer just being inside the Peppermill.  I also love the colored sugar.  Call me crazy, but it's fun.  . . The food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh atthe fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.  . . If you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.  I'll bet you find something you like too.
I ordered the munches breakfast meal and it contained Portuguese sausage, green/red peppers, onions, has browns, and topped with a layer of egg. Side of wheat toast.. . It was so DELICIOUS! The hostess and the waitress was very generous and setting is very clean. Despite how busy it was on a Sunday, we was seated very quickly.. . The next time I come here I'm trying the country fried steak!. . :):):):)
The cab driver suggested we try this novelty restaurant while visiting. My husband had the club sandwich, I had the Mushroom Swiss Burger. We both had fries as our choice side item. The fries were a little soft, like double dipped almost. The main entrees were good. Although the mushrooms tasted like a can. Over all it was ok. The club sandwich was better than my burger! The portions sizes are huge!
Not a fan of diners but I can't get enough of this place. I always bring my friends there when they come to visit and everyone has a great experience. My favorite drink in Las Vegas is there (Champagne Cocktail, not on the menu anymore but you can still order it) and friends comment that it's some of the best crafted drinks they've ever had. Food is yummy and it's fun to kick back in the lounge and listen to cheesy music. I find excuses to go there! A must for a tourist and local.
Since, this place was the nearest and had the best ratings on yelp from the location where I was staying on the strip this is where I ended up eating my SATURDAY Breakfast. . . The wait time was 30-45 minutes for a group of five people. I believe we waited longer though. The bar inside the restaurant had no wait. But, you could only order appetizers as food entrees. The inside of the restaurant looks like a rave or a strip club.  The neon lighting is pretty epic. The staff was very friendly being that this place was super packed with people waiting inside and outdoors for a table. . . The Menu was a little overwhelming -- it had a big selection to choice from. So, what ever your probably craving after a long night of partying.. they probably have it on their menu. Everyone in my group had breakfast entrees... We all seemed to like there crispy hash browns. Oh... Did I mention the colorful sugar on the table? Yes, there sugar for coffee looks like confetti. Super cool and colorful, just like their dining area.
I do not know how this place has such good reviews on yelp except for the fact that I think a lot of people come here drunk at 5:00AM for a huge greasy breakfast, and when you are drunk, leaving the club, things taste a lot different.. I have been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both times where exactly the same experience. . The service was good, servers are attentive, food comes out quickly.. Thats where it goes all bad........ The food is terrible. Greasy diner food that is equivalent to IHOP or Dennys.. I will say that the portions are huge. They give you a lot of food..... a lot of really really bad food!!!!!
