So apparently my own real ID doesn't look like me. So they wouldn't let me in.  According to them they go to school for recognizing identifications. Guess they passed with an F.  Wouldn't let my 28-year-old self in on my own birthday
Getting into the marquee nightclub was extremely difficult and quite frankly not worth it. We stood in the line for a very long time even though we were on the guest list. Then someone made an announcement to turn the line around because we were going to enter a different way, or else we would be stuck in this guest list line for another 30 minutes. We were also warned that we had to go up a few flights of stairs. The line being 80% females in heels, we asked if we could just take our chances and wait, we were told no, so we began walking up the stairs. We didn't reach the nightclub until we had walked up 8 flights of stairs in heels. By the time we arrived, we were ready to go, our feet hurt and we were tired. We decided to stay because we didn't all that hard work to get there, it would have been silly to just leave. The drinks were okay and the music was just okay, definitely not worth the hassle.
Probably one of the best places if you want to go clubbing in Vegas. . . We went there on Saturday to see Benny Bennassi performance. Got presale male tickets (40$ each but fully worth it), so waiting in the line took no longer than 8 minutes. The venue itself is substantially big, with one dancefloor outdoors, sourrounded by jacuzzis and pools and main dancefloor inside. Before  Around 11-12 pm it got really packed, so dancing could get a bit annoying when everyone around is pushing you. Drinks are quite expensive, around 20$ for basics (gin&tonic etc), however amazing soundsystem and visualizations make up for it. We had a slight problem with credit card at VIP table, not sure if it's club fault or some other third party though. The ratio boys-girls is somewhat equal, lot of bachelor parties there;). In general, I would highly recommend goingthere for a tremendous night out.
Niiicccceeee..... . We went to the dayclub. Walked right through with a presale ticket. My bartender was real attentive and was gorgeous to boot. Good looking crowd.. . Everybody was super cool. Drinks were a tad more expensive than other Vegas places, but it's in the Cosmopolitan so you should expect to pay more. . . Kinda got I have a table so I'm better than you kinda vibe. One D-Bag tried to get me kicked out his section, until he realized I was walking to a friends that I knew. The security guard just nodded to me and said, "Yeah, I know." I didn't care I was half in the bag.. . Great times, beautiful women. I'll be back.
If you haven't been to Marquee, then you probably live under a rock. This is what has been the "It Spot" since Town Center opened. Although it's not my favorite club, this place has never disappointed me. . . About 3 years ago, I spent my 21st birthday here and had the time of my life. My latest visit was few days ago on a Friday. We got a comped table right by the dance floor which was pretty awesome. We were treated amazing by all the workers. I've never been to Marquee on a Friday and I don't think I ever want to again. That place is a total zoo! So many people. Me and my friends decided to go to the bathroom which was literally 10 feet away and got mosh pitted on our way there. Other than that we all had a great time. The drinks came flowing and the crowd didn't even matter. . . Must go if you're visiting Vegas!
BEWARE OF PICK POCKETERS!!!!!!!. . In terms of the club itself, I'd give it 5 stars. I loved the energy and my girls and I were having a great time partying at a table...UNTIL, we walked onto the dance floor. Within 30 seconds of standing there, 3 of the 8 of us had been pick pocketed. We were all wearing long purses that were closed and locked. The thieves managed to unlock the flap, open it and steal our phones/wallets. We reported it to the club manager and were told sorry, but that happens a lot. Seriously? That's all you could do?? Once we made our way out of the club, we saw another girl who had the same thing happen to her. Oh yea, and this was also our first night in town, so needless to say it was difficult getting around town the rest of the weekend. We were told we could come back to Marquee and not worry about having to show ID to be able to drink. Why in the world would we ever want to return somewhere like that?! Epic fail Marquee. If you know this happens frequently, how about you warn women? This type of thing happens all the time in Europe, but it's not as if we don't travel there just because it happens.
I went with a huge college group for a day party at the pool. We had such a blast! The pool was amazing and the cabanas were beautiful and spotless. The bathrooms were nice and clean. The waterfall and palm trees made the place feel tropical even though we were technically inside. . I loved that they had a cutoff so the pool never got overcrowded. I would definitely recommend Marquee for a day of fun at the pool!
This review is long overdue... and is primarily for Brian Ticke!! (although the staff was cool). I came to Marquee last year with a friend during our first trip to Vegas and contacted Brian to help us get on the Guest List. He did an amazing job in ensuring things ran smoothly and they did. The music and drinks were good.. . 2 weeks ago, I returned to Vegas with a group of co-workers and all 9 of us wanted to have a good time. I contacted Brian and he didn't disappoint.. again. . . I'm looking forward to the next trip!
Horrible.  Rudest doormen and security guards. Not verbally, but as in they will grab you, push you, knock you out of the way whenever they see fit.  I got seperated from my group and after being pushed down a lined of 5 security guards creating a human wall I was on the other side of the club and because it is such a fire hazard and over packed, it took my 45 minutes to even find them again.  Nightmare.
This review is for the nightclub only. . I'm a little biased, because Marquee was the first nightclub I ever went to. With stars in my eyes and blisters the size of marbles on my toes, I looked around in awe at what remains, in my eyes, as one of the best nightclubs in Vegas. . It has an intimate feel, with so much to look at that you'll be dazzled. There's an upper platform above the stage where dancers strut their stuff, and an upper level of tables as well. Confetti rains, world-class DJs give Saudi princes birthday shout-outs: the usual Vegas glitz and glamour. But Marquee feels classy, despite all the gritty glitter. It smells nice, for god's sake. Everything is so well-executed that you lose yourself inside Marquee until you stumble out at 5 AM, shocking a family on their way to a sunrise tour of Hoover Dam (hypothetically, of course).
Out of all the nightclubs I went to in Las Vegas, this was the best one. Came for their marquee Mondays (one of a few big time parties going on in Vegas on a Monday night) and it was indeed marquee. They have two rooms here: one is indoor and is more the Vegas party music completed with all the theatrics, the other room is outside by the pools and is more hip hop music (which was my favorite but I can say both of them was off the hook). Drinks here are your normal Vegas priced drinks and there is indeed beautiful people all over this place (and when I say people, I mean women in my case lol). Great music, great crowd, just great everything and the place to be on a Monday night in Vegas.
Same as other along the strip night clubs...expensive...long line...played nothing but house music..all nice no music that you can dance with. Overall 1 star. :(
AWFULL GOT SCAMMED I Don't wanna even give this club 1 star.  I frequent the club scene here in Vegas since I'm a local and have friends come into town every weekend.  My friend's sister had her 21st bday last night so wet went to Marquee which was my first time we got bottle service like i do at ALL the other clubs service was horrible there were 6 in our party we got crammed next to a party of 12 only half of us for you sit down and this is why we pay to have BOTTLE SERVICE . We went to dance and came back and half our bottle was gone were told by another party that the big group next to us helped themselves we each only got 2 drinks from our bottle. The so called security watching the tables were drinking with the party next to us.  AND THE WORST PART We WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND BOTH THE GUYS IN MY PARTY WERE CHARGED FOR The BILL WHEN THE WAITRESS WAS SUPPOSED TO SPLIT THE BILL BETWEEN THEM.  I will never go back there and will never recommend that club. I have a big following on FB AND IG  and friends always ask my opinions on clubs well not this club.
What a place! Loved the vibe, crowd and DJ. definitely have to give a shout out to the security guard working the 4.5 level last night for giving us gals some free and comfy sandals on our way out. What a sweetheart!
This club made all other clubs I have ever clubbed at look like a high school gym. It is absolutely ginormous, and the craziest thing is that it was filled to overflowing with bodies. Which basically means you better be prepared to mosh your way to a toilet.. . I spent most of the night on the main dance floor waiting for Porter Robinson to come on. When he started the whole place went kind of crazy. Marquee's got the whole bonanza - confetti raining down from the ceiling, mist "cannons" that cool the area and simultaneously blind you for 20 seconds, and an elevated platform above the DJ where costumed girls danced and performed.. . An amazing first Vegas trip. Upvote.. . Pro-tip: Find yourself a promoter. Ask on Facebook. Somebody you know comes to Vegas every other weekend, and they can help you out. Promoters will get you into these clubs for free when otherwise you would have to pay $20-$40 a dude. Girls are obviously free.
