We stayed here for our honeymoon and reserved a GO Luxury Room with a strip view. The room was cute and stylish, bed was comfortable. The automatic drapes and floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch. The sink however would fill up very quickly and drain extremely slow. Our strip view that we paid extra for was covered by a Donnie and Marie banner outside. We also paid extra for an early check in, and was told we would be contacted once the room was ready at noon. By 2:00 we still had not heard anything so I called and sure enough it had been ready the whole time.. . My biggest concern and complaint is the valet service.  We parked our car valet on Sunday and picked it up Wednesday, so who knows what could have happened in between.  When we picked it up we immediately noticed our gas tank was 1/4 tank lower then when we left it, but decided we couldn't really do much about it. Later down the road I noticed a starbucks napkin next to the seat. We have not been to starbucks in this car, its brand new. And finally and most damaging when we stopped for gas 2 hours down the road we noticed a huge deep scrape on the back passenger wheel and a large chunk out of the tire. I have attempted to contact the hotel regarding this and have not received any response. . . The elevators are HORRIBLE, dirty, rickety, some feel very unsafe. The casino was just okay, nothing special, old. Margaritaville was okay, cool decor, lots to look at, food was nothing special but good, same with the drinks. The animal habitat was nice to check out, although from other reviews I expected more. . . We had to pay $20/day resort fee which is supposed to cover the gym and wifi. Our wifi did not work at all. We also noticed a sign in the room saying wifi was $13.99/day. Kinda pissed at that!!. . The best & worst part of the whole place is the pool. We had lots of fun the two days we spent at the pool. The drinks are strong and the music is fun. The pool food was far better then any of the restaurants at the Flamingo! That being said, shame on Flamingo for allowing just anyone into this pool. We had to stand in line for an hour before the pool even opened just to get a lounge chair. This pool is not just for hotel guests witch is appalling to me! Anyone can pay to get in. In fact they didn't even check our room keys or IDs (21+) upon entering. We could have been anyone off the street. . . Watch out for the various booths around the hotel with people offering you a free show and buffet. It sounded like a great deal and the people were nice, so we signed up. When we went to our free buffet, only then did we find out we were stuck in a Wyndham timeshare scam for 5 hours!!! . . We saw Vinny Favorito at the Flamingo. The show was great! We laughed the whole time. Hes not for everyone though, they do warn you when you buy the tickets. He performs in Bugsy's Cabaret, its almost disgusting in there. They really need to update that room. We were seated on very small chairs placed extremely close together. Chairs and carpet looks VERY dirty, we almost walked out before the show started due to the state of the room. Glad we stayed because Vinny was hilarious. . . We also ate at the Paradise Garden buffet during our stay. It was truly gross. Everything I tried tasted was nasty. Oversalted, stale, real lack of any kind of quality. WAY over priced for what you get to choose from. No dessert bar at all! Very outdated seating & decor. In fact I had the worst stomach ache later that night. Pretty positive it was the buffet food.. . All in all we would stay here again if the price was right. Our room and the pool was the best part, and thats what we would come back for. I would take our dining elsewhere. They really need to update the rest of the hotel to match the new style of the rooms. Especially since the Linq is right outside and the Quad is so new and updated.
Probably for nostaglic reasons, it's been here for a long time since my 1st year university days, the only one I could afford back then lol.  And compared to the newer style casinos in past 10 years, Flamingo really still has that old-fashioned feel to it, the way Bugsy wanted it probably.. . Came here for their famous burlesque show, recommended by the way.. . In my humble opinion, it's still the best central location.. . It's still quite busy on the gaming floor, easy to find different games.
Dilapidated, overpriced, loud, dowdy, cheap, spring break crowd, wait in line for EVERYTHING, $4 for a little bottle of Dasani, service is indignant...I mean, why go here?
I thought this was a great place to stay. And had a great location right on the strip and also right on the linq which is the new hot happening place to be! My only complaint is that the pool area, while it was an amazing area to be in, the pool was 55! Not a single person wanted to get in the pool especially when it was 82 outside and windy. they should really keep that pool it was disgustingly cold later we went to Redondo beach and the water was warmer at the ocean that it was at the flamingo. I would go back but I would want it to be a lot lot hotter when I went.
We loved our stay at The Flamingo.  I was originally a little worried that it wasn't going to be as amazing as we had hoped because it's an older name in Las Vegas hotels.  I was so happy to be wrong on this though!  We had an amazing time, loved our room (Go Room) and the staff were very friendly and helpful.. . The pool was amazing as well.  We even went to a beach club and I'd say that the experience was comparable, if not better at the hotel pool.. . Location was great, once you walk outside, you're in the middle of everything.  Easily walk to all the best locations on the strip, experience all the Vegas-like things you would want to do.  If it's not close by.... then there's a shuttle to get you there, or at leas someone in the hotel that can help you get there the quickest, and cheapest ways.. . Casino was good, Margaritaville Casino was fun too.. . Overall, a great hotel that we would be happy to visit again in the near future.
My wife and I booked this vacation through the Flamingo's website.  We  chose it based on location and price.  After much searching, they had the cheapest price for the combined airfare and  motel  stay.   Here is a list of things that  really did not set well with me. . 1)  The check in process.  After  dealing with more than 7 hours of  traveling,  we had to stand in line for more than an hour to get checked into the room.   Part of the issue was  they only had  3 - 5 people checking in guest and they had way more computers than that and they were just not used.  . 2)  Everything in the room is extra;  refrigerator,  microwave.  . 3)  House keeping was terrible.  After our first night the next day we showered and went on the strip.  They did not clean our room,  we had to call and have  housekeeping  bring us fresh towels and  pick up our trash.   The 2nd day,  we were scheduled for  the Celine Dion  Show and had to go without showering because you guessed it  no house keeping service.  We called and requested towels and was told that we were priority, and after waiting an hour,  no  one showed up.  . 4)  Resort fee is extra 18.00 a day after booking fees are paid.
Recent stay at The Flamingo...the room was a room. Suppose it was the most inexpensive but it didn't have any seating other than a bench or the bed. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Having stayed with 2 other friends who each had different rooms, there doesn't seem to be any consistency in decor or amenities. Some had coffee pots, some had nice seating, some had ceiling fans. What is this all about? Rooms at the same price should be consistent. As several reviews have noted, the carpet on many floors, I was on 8 is in much need of replacement. It is filty and rippled. This is a walking hazard and a law suit waiting to happen. Very easy to trip and fall. TV reception was very poor, as was Internet strength and consistency. With many other choices in Vegas, I would chose another property for a future visit. Most staff were friendly and helpful.
This hotel needs a major revamp! We paid for an upgraded room this weekend and it was awful. There were several holes in the sheets on both beds, hair in the sink & shower, the vent above the shower head was covered in a heavy layer of dust, the closet didn't have any hangars, the sink did not drain well if you ran the water for more than 5 seconds. The air conditioning didn't seem to work well and was extremely loud and bothersome while sleeping.. . Ownership and management really should  asses the cleanliness of rooms.
Find another Vegas hotel.... . I booked a non-smoking room with a king. I was surprised to see an online check in option email on the morning we were to arrive. So I clicked the link and "checked in."  When we arrived to the front desk of the hotel, the employee assisting us informed us we had checked in online and our "smoking room with 2 queens" was ready.  No, no, no, no.  I informed here there was absolutely no option as to what type of room you could check into on the link that was sent to me.  Rather, it just allowed you to tell the hotel what time you were arriving.  She was extremely rude and told me "you're not guaranteed a king."  If that's the case, then why the hell does the hotel take my money and allow you to choose the type of room you want and reserve it, then not have it available when you arrive? . . Eventually after I expressed my frustration about this, she told me I could get a "handicapped" room on the lowest floor of the hotel with a king.  We get to the room which was supposed to be "newly remodeled."  However, they only replaced the floor, TV and added a lounge chair by the window.  All the rest of the furniture was old and horribly beat up.  Additionally, the pillows on the beds WERE HORRIBLE.  Additionally, the bathroom looked like it was strait out of the 80's, with the shower mold to prove it.  . . The elevator faces were also extremely worn out and gross. The parking garage was dirty and rusty. The pool wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but the crowd was mostly older and/or on the white trash side. This is just another tired hotel on the strip.  If I were you, I'd stay elsewhere.
Ah Vegas, We were at the Flamingo this weekend. The building was like an IceBox all weekend. Since I test a/c units everyday my guess is it was 60 degrees in the whole building. When at the ProLabs Inspectors conference and Picking up some CEs at a Plumbing class. I heard something dripping, looked over to see water running down a wall in the Reno room near an electrical outlet. The elevators gave every rider and I, the shared concern and worry that we might not make it out alive. There were noises of rattling and unusual elevator behavior. Looked up to see the ceiling of the elevator vibrating back and forth. A lot of this place needs some serious upgrades. While heading to our room we were met with high sale pushy vendors trying to sell time shares. While gambling one night was met with another dubious caractor who asured me, he could help me make thousands at the crap table. Yeh right dude. The remodeling of another building across the way started early and woke us up at 6:am. The last morning the fire alarm went off somewhere at 5:30am. When we called the operator she didn't have a clue then checked with security who told here it was a test..........for an hour? Finally I check my bill on the peace of CR$P TV in our room to find out they over charged me. They corrected my bill. All and All the convention was great, I learned a great deal and appreciate ProLabs sponsorship. Perhaps they should find a new location next time. We had some great meals at the big mall down the street one of the best was at Buddy Vs. We couldn't eat in our hotel because neither my wife nor I thought about bringing a sweat shirt to stay warm in Vegas!
Stayed here for 10 days this month. Had a great experience with everything except for my bill. I asked for a totaled up bill my second night and was given one amount. The night before I was checking out I asked to pay my bill in full. The two amounts varied and when questioned about it I was advised they may have comped a few days for me. Now when I checked out online there was an additional 200 charge. I went to the front desk and asked what the charge was they said it was for my final night. I spent 2 hours in person and on the phone complaining only to be told sorry! We don't give credits or refunds due to our staff making mistakes!! Seriously? Guess my 10 day stay didn't mean anything or the meals I ate at the casino or the clients I entertained. Sorry Flamingo you blew this one.
Rooms have been partially renovated so that's nice.  New tvs and floors.  We stayed in a room over looking the strip for free on Wednesday and Thursday night.  Only had to pay the $20 a night resort fee.  Wifi worked.  I went to the spa for a $10 fee, it was just ok.  You can't beat the location!
The only thing I liked about this hotel was the location in the middle of the strip & the adult pool. The pool is pretty big and not too crowded, they sell mixed drinks & beer and have music. . The hotel overall just has a rundown feel to it, from the narrow parking garage, to the ugly elevators, and narrow hallways with the carpet popping up all over the place. There was no mini fridge in the room & they charge you $15 a night to get one . The eating establishments all suck and there aren't very many choices
Pounding Loud Music until 3:15!. I reserved an upgraded go room with a strip view.  Room was fine, but the problem is that all rooms that remotely face the Drais Night Club will experience loud pounding music until 3:15.  It was near impossible to sleep.  The hotel knows about this problem very well, as the operator acknowledged numerous complaints.
This was our first time we stayed at the Flamingo. We stayed in a "Fab" room because all the upgrades to the "Go" rooms were sold out. It was an average room that definately was run down. Would recommend upgrading to the Go room. . . We checked in online via the email they sent, which helped us avoid the horrendously long lines. When you check in online you go to the "keys and mail" line which was much shorter. Time share people at every corner, we just smiled and always said no thank you. Elevators were run down. Pool area was nice, no outside food or drink allowed in (which was annoying). The outside gardens with the flamingos and koi fish were nice. Get a rewards card upon arrival, you get a discount at all stores and restaurants at the hotel with it. . . Overall the location was nice, but we probably wouldn't stay here again.
We arrived in Vegas at 8:45 but didn't actually get in our stained walled, stained carpet, stained bathroom sink, with no lights room at 1130 pm because of the long ass lines to check in. At midnight we were being moved to our second room because of the disgusting "upgraded room" they said they had put us in. The carpet was bunched up and taped up with grey tape from the dollar store. Our second room was not any better but we stayed there for the first night. The next day we hit the strip. As i'm getting ready to pull out cash from my bank card I notice that the hotel has charged my card not only the hotel fee and resort fee along with the incidental fee but has also charged me an extra 400 for idk. I go to the front desk to find out only to wait for another hour in line. When I finally get to the front desk the guy says to wait a minute. I follow him only to find out that not only is he making the only working girl in the counter and the 100 + people waiting in line wait so that he can talk to his girlfriend about what they are going to eat for lunch. WTF. I get a manager to try to help me. She finally tells me " I know what room they put u in and I am sorry I know it is bad." They upgrade us to a nice suite, so if you havnt been counting that 3 rooms in 12hrs that we have been in,  but I have been home from Vegas almost a month now and the money they put on hold is still not being released and all the comps they told me they would give me are still not showing up on my credit card. The location is amazing it is smack in the middle of the strip  the rooms well it was like a scene from a horror story. The casino was ok Margaritaville was extremely overrated. Would I stay here again F%$^ NO!!!! I guess I"ll try the LINQ?!. Even Treasure Island was a better stay..
The price was good and the location was perfect. We just had a standard deluxe room and it was fine for the price. The bathroom shower was my biggest complaint. It was small and poor water pressure. Everything else in the room we were satisfied with. The pool lets anyone from any hotel in for free so it is way overcrowded. The whole time we were there only 2 or 3 elevators were working so we had to find our way through the employee back room maze to get up and down. The only other option was waiting 20 min for an elevator. Housekeeping was good and same with service in the restaurants. Overall you get what you pay for.
I have never stayed at the Flamingo before and was actually kind of excited when I found out my Husband had booked our room there.  We had a two-bed room in the dog friendly level, although we didn't have a dog with us.  I think we had the cheapest rooms they offer. . . I was a little disappointed when we first entered the room because I have heard that the rooms are pink and the bathrooms are pink and the beds are pink, and everything is pink.  Our room was not pink, at all.  However it was clean and smelled normal, couldn't ask for much more.. . The beds were pretty soft, almost too soft for our taste, I like a firm bed.  Our friend staying with us liked it though.  If you like soft beds then you are in luck.. . The floors are weird, laminate instead of carpet.  Although after I thought about it, it made sense.  Laminate would be easier to clean and much more sanitary then carpet, so that was a plus.  . . The bathroom was smallish but clean.  The sink backed up every time we used it and took forever to drain leaving a gross mess of face-wash water or toothpaste-spit water residue, nasty!. . The shower was a bummer.  Absolutely ZERO water pressure and ittook the water at least 15 minutes to warm up to hot water.  . . Overall was not impressed, but I wasn't upset.  I would definitely stay here again because the hotel is in the center of the strip making it a great location.  . . Also the air-conditioner made an eerie sound when turning off.        . . And Wi-Fi sucked butt.
Spent a couple of nights here (10/17-10/19).  Was in town to see Zac Brown Band and Jimmy Buffett.  And this hotel had the Margaritaville Pool Party.. . When reading many reviews of this place everyone said to book a GO room.  So that's what I did and turns out they were right.  Check-in wasn't bad, probably waited about 20 minutes.  Nicely furnished room and bathroom.  Cool thing is the tv in the bathroom mirror.. . We stayed on the 25th floor and didn't have any issue with noise.  Our room was on the side that was next to The Cromwell.  You can definitely hear the music but it's not as bad as people made it out to be.  And plus, you're in Vegas who cares?!?!?!. . My only major gripe with this hotel is the resort fee.  And I know it's hard to get away from these fees at the Strip hotels and normally I don't mind them.  But the fee was $22 a day and it was supposed to include Wi-Fi on ONE device (which I thought was weird). But I couldn't even get the wifi to work on my one device.  But since we used the pool it made the resort fee worth it.. . Be wary of the parking garage though.  We found a parking spot each time but there are a lot of blind spots and since everyone in Vegas seems oblivious to things...you might get hit.  Thankfully we didn't. . Overall it's a solid hotel if you want a place right in the middle of the strip.  I'd stay here again if the price was right for a GO Room.
Spent 5 nights Oct 19-23, 2014.  I have a list of complaints.. 1-No phone book in the room. 2-Microwave, coffee or fridge so what do  U do w/huge portions of food you can't finish at the restaurants? . 3-Faint odor of smoke in the non-smoking room.. 4-On the table between the beds (which were very comfortable) there was a light and a clock radio.  Neither was plugged in and when I moved the table to plug them in I could not see a wall outlet.  Moved the radio to another part of the room.. 5-Bathroom exhaust was very weak and the room was steamed up after a hot shower. . 6-The inner plastic shower curtain was very short and it was easy to flood the bathroom floor when taking a shower.. 7-Hotel employees (dressed all in black) haucking shows, and other stuff as soon as you get out of the elevator and walk into the casino.  I expect this out on the strip, but not in the hotel.  We walked through a few other hotels and there were people at kiosks selling things, but they were NOT in your face like at the Flamingo.. 8-We were on the 5th floor and the rugs outside the elevators was wrinkled.  I'm sure sooner or later if they are not replaced some older person is going to trip, fall and get hurt.. On a positive the food was good, and so was the room cleaners.  But for sure I'll never come back to this hotel.
Although I didn't like this casino as much in the past, it's really grown on me. There is a good age range here for those who like to frequent the strip and party. It's right in the middle of the strip, so no matter which direction you want to go, there is always something going on. I also like their little nature walk with the animals.Their pool and it's a pretty nice looking place. It's also got people in there partying as well. On the weekends you'll find gogo dancers around the Casino tables. I mainly love this place for the location. This is also one of those casinos where I actually win money back on the slots!
Quite disappointed in our room at the hotel. The website really gave the impression that all rooms were clean, updated, with many amenities. To my dismay, the room was super outdated, smelled like smoke (even though a non-smoking room), the bathroom small with an awkward full mirror placed next to the toilet. . The water in the shower went from hot to cold while showering. . Our shower curtain was replaced 3 days into our stay. The packaging was left on the floor of the bathroom. The do not disturb door hanger wasn't in our room. . There was paint drippings on the outside of the window. . Very disappointed in the rooms. Won't be staying here again in the future.
Its very hard for a newbie to know where to stay when coming to vegas. Should i  go strip or off strip, downtown, south, north? There are lots of options regarding housing but only one old school, and thats Flamingo, the first hotel on the Strip. . . Center strip location, to a great price compared to the quality and service you get. Its not tacky neither fancy, its a hotel, perfectly located to discover the rest of vegas. Pool area is BIG and will leave you two choices, either go the party/music way or the calmer way in the pool upstairs. Pool area is definitely spacey and one of the better ones in Vegas. Also during season in weekends, they offer a light dayparty in the bigger "Party" pool. . . Overall, Vegas is a cheap place to find really fancy hotels, but you dont have to splurge to stay okay. I always go by the classic phrase "Im just gonna sleep at the room". And since i often stay for a week or so, I rather spend my money on other experiences outside the hotel. . . In Vegas I rank location before stylish hotels since location and distance is the vital thing here. So if you dont want to end up spending most of your time walking, stay centre strip!
Vegas!!! That's right, Vegas is Vegas. . . Now for the Flamingo itself. I admit that I am most definitely overrating this place because of the great experience I had here the weekend of Sept. 20th. (Second time in Vegas this year. Previous stay was in August at the Platinum). But hey, at the end of the day the experience is what counts the most right ? . . So I came with my gf for her birthday. We stayed in a "deluxe" room which had little to offer other than a bed and bathroom. It was small but since it was just the two of us it was alright for us. We really enjoyed the pool. It was basically a big party that had a great crowd with good vibes. I forget what it's called, I think it's called the Habitat but either way it's the area you walk through to get to the pool when you're coming from inside the hotel/casino is really nice. They had flamingos (of course) and other animals. This place made for a really romantic pizza dinner I had there with my gf. We walked a bit and sat at one of the benches with drinks in hand. Really romantic right!?? Lol . . Again the rating is a bit more than I would otherwise give if it wasn't for that romantic pizza dinner I would say 3 stars! Haha but anyway it was definitely a great location on the strip with lots to offer. . . It's Vegas! It's up to you to make the trip great not so much the location. So cheers my friends! Have a great time!
