As far as major American airports go, Phoenix Sky Harbor (PSH) is an amazing place.  Clean, modern, well maintained and easily accessible.. . I often fly through PSH because of my love affair with the 'heart' airline a/k/a Southwest.  It's one of SW's hubs and for good reason.  With the beautiful Arizona weather and large, modern airport it makes for a great option.. . There is, of course, some walking to be done as with any huge airport in a major city.  However, PSH accommodates the lazy with moving walkways.  Yes, I admit I'm the guy power walking on the left side.  Makes you feel like a fast forward cartoon!. . Despite the size of the facility it's immaculate when compared so some of the aging monoliths in other cities.  You won't find disgusting carpets or worn out chairs.  Everything feels modern and clean for such a high traffic airport.  Even the restrooms are spotless and taken care of.. . One of my favorite features on PSH is the abundance of charging station for travelers with hungry electronic toys.  Nothing more annoying that having your phone at 3% with no plugs in sight.  That's never and issue at PSH.. . Overall, PSH is a great airport.  One of my favorites.
WOW who gives airports rave reviews..... guess they all go to Phoenix lol. Who knew! Andsomeone else likes their TSA too!! .....the standard agents of doom. . Yeah it does have an aged, back in the day modern type feel to it but thats its uniqueness I guess. I just loved the agents here cause theyre SMART ENOUGH to inspect passengers/carryons without typical hassle n irritations of fishing all sorts of minor ass bullznits out of your luggage TAKE THIS OUT TAKE THAT out take this off remove that. I was freakn shocked to my marrow!!! SMART I tell ya !!! s.m.a.r.t!!!!!!! Unlike some guy questioning like 10 other agents at another airport about my freakn butter knife I forgot in my laptop bag. *rme* . This doesnt mean theyre not doing their job cause trust I looked back at the agent monitoring screens and she was peering INTENTLY!!!!! I miss pre 9-11 travel days just glad this airport isnt going all apeshhyt over it. Although theyre probably not a big mark like some other hubs. . . +++ I pulled a VIP move and gallantly walked into a TSA pre board line...cause I seriously thought they were letting ppl w/boarding passes go through, I was promptly sent back at the last second, get back in line and the tsa guy still cuts me back to the other side of pre-Board.....teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehehehehheheheheeeee. LOL I think he saw what happened. I love those guys . xoxoxooxoxoxxooxoxoxooxoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ok the terminal itself has some good restaurants and is pretty clean and nice, IF Southwest Airlines manages to put your connecting flight in the same terminal as your arriving flight, not in A when you arrive in D and less than 30 minutes from landing to take off. Also, each terminal letter (A,B, C,) has two actual terminal arms associated with it so you actually will be going past two terminals for every letter you are away. The D terminal is only one arm. . . Today, I arrived at theC gate at 6:20 because of a 20 minute delay in LA. My connecting flight was boarding at 6:10. So much for Early Bird Check In. There wasn't a whole lot of time to begin with. I would have landed at 6 pm and boarded at 6:10. . . I ran the distance to get to the gate and was literally THE LAST person to board. I would have used the people movers but there are so many people who feel they have to stand in the exact center of those that it makes it slower than just running on the hard surface. I feel badly for the elderly, handicapped and people with small children every time this happens to me. A wider people moved would be awesome and if southwest would cart people over for connecting flights, it would be even better. . . AVOID PHOENIX ON YOUR SOUTHWEST ROUTE unless your flight originates there.
Well now, I just noticed airports sure do get a lot of Yelp reviews. And pictures too. Maybe that is the one category all Yelpers have in common.. . My TSA barker was pretty adamant: "I want EVERYTHING out of your pockets! EVERYTHING! No tissue, no gum, no lint, EVERYTHING! I want those pockets cleared of EVERYTHING! I mean EVERYTHING!" You gotta admire people who know what they want. When the guy ahead of me mumbled, "Can I keep my glasses on?" I whispered, "Just don't put them in your pocket." He got to keep his glasses on.. . I may have missed the memo here, but I thought this was a pretty cool airport. Granted I only saw Terminal 4, but jeez, there's a lot to see. Whipped out the New Balance and got in 2.5 miles walking the concourse between gates, much to the amusement of the walkway people. Oh c'mon, I can't be the first person who's ever done that. Incidentally, the carpet has little planes in them.. . If nothing else, there must have been over a dozen places here to get coffee, and I've never seen that before. The two cups I did have were really good, but would have been a little better if I had some Nicorette. But you know, I had to empty my pockets.
Airport is a little old and could use some updating. Maybe I was in the old terminal or something. Security line in Terminal 2 was long and a bit slow. . . Staff wasn't very friendly and even a tad rude about the extra screening of my bag. . . Overall experience was smooth and I made my flight.. . There was also free wifi which was very convenient. A few of the bathrooms were set up a bit strange and didn't have enough stalls or urinals, especially for a busy airport.
I have flown in and out of PHX many times and have found it to be a nice airport. Well laid out with decent food options. Of course the weather here helps with its good reputation about being low on delays.
The best most efficient airport. There's hardly ever a wait in security and the cell phone lot is very close. Pick up n drop offs are easy.  and Visit Chelsea's kitchen for good for amazing food before your flight..
I'm really confused by this airport since ... not going to lie but PHX isn't exactly a GIGANTIC airport, so I don't get why they had to make their rental center 15 minutes by bus from where the terminals are and arrival area(s). . . It's very bizarre since airports only do this to anticipate massive expansions, and ... maybe I just don't see that. Judgements aside .... . There are quite a few places in this airport that are well rated and are good places. This is contradictory for airports since most airport food, drinks, etc. suck. I like that they took the time to ensure that good places are here, or invite those businesses so there's something to do when you're waiting.. . Overall, the efficiency is *ok*, the bathrooms could use some updating, and it isn't the best airport I've ever been to ... but it isn't the worse either.
This is a huge airport! Better arrive early to get around unless you know exactly where to go! Also, if you rent a car, you have to take a shuttle to an offsite car rental facility. Although a very nice, new facility, it takes time to get there. It is a few miles away, so if you do rent a car, allow enough time to take the shuttle to and from the airport to pickup/drop off a car. The airport is very nice with lots of shops and good food!
Horrible.  The hidden taxes and fees are ridiculous.  They try to con you into buying their total insurance package. I was told I was initialing to decline all services and when I looked again after, I actually had signed for $4/day roadside assistance.  What a scan.  Will not be renting from them again.  I will be filing with the BBB
I haven't had a bad experience yet. Even when I get to the airport late I seem to get through security fast and on time for my flight. The staff is usually very helpful asking if I need a ride to my gate but I politely decline. I wouldn't want to take that opportunity away from someone who is unable to walk the distance. So far it's one of the better airports in the US.
The very first time I drove myself at Sky Harbor the traffic drove so fast and the signs so confusing I ended up crashing and flattening two tires.  Yes, this was my first time living in a big city but I travel a lot and been to several airports.  Fast forward 14 years and I still find Sky Harbor one of the most confusing to navigate around.  The shuttles and buses drive like jerks.  I often find myself laying on the horn at them.. . Once inside the airport (I frequent terminal 4 most but have also been to terminal 2) your visit will be a lot better.  I find the signs easy to understand and they always have people around to answer questions.  There is a heavy police presence and I feel safe there.. . As far as cleanliness I say they could probably do better but perhaps that's because some of the decor is a bit outdated.  I do think Sky Harbor has a distinct smell, not necessarily bad just... distinct.. . So. of all the airports I've been to I'd have to say Sky Harbor is towards the top of the list.
Love the new foodoptions in terminal 4, and the enhanced clubs at US Airways.
I've flown through some of the biggest and strangest airports in the world, London Heathrow, Madrid, Charles Dugal Paris, Philidelphia, Chicago (o'hare and midway) and I have to say Sky Harbor really has it's shit together compared to the rest of the world. .     The gates are easy to find, the restaurants are all pretty great (especially the the four peaks that just went in), and because of the way it's laid out it's easy to come pick people up and drop them off curb-side. .       The only thing I have to point out that really gets me is the piss poor job TSA does at managing wait time at security. As other airports the wait is either non-existent or so long that you are prepared to beg for the sweet release of death when you're half-way through it. .       Not really sure why I'm reviewing this as there really isn't much of a choice as far as airports go in Arizona. It's either here or Mesa-gateway...... and come'on no one actually flies out of Mesa-Gateway. So it's either Skyharbor or bust.
Best Airport EVER!  TSA actually does their job.  Everywhere else they just talk  among themselves and have a bad attitude.  I travel every week and I'm always glad to come back home to Phoenix.
It's okay, not a big airport but it gets us to where we need to go. The concessions are okay and the planes are usually on time. The staff are helpful when needed. it's easy to drive to as airports go. No complaints.
My least favorite airport when flying East. However, if you book with Southwest or US Airways...you'l prolly end up here. I just hate how hard it is to get to the different terminals. On one occasion we really had to haul butt to get to out connecting flight. I guess the only way to avoid this place is book with another airline besides US Airways or Southwest.
new local restaurants! get em while theyre ebola free...
Big fan of the wait board parking lot. You don't have to take laps like at other airports, you can just sit there and watch until the flight you're waiting for has landed. The airport is clean and friendly staff are available to help.
Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it.
Long walk from the B terminal to the A terminal.  Lots of restaurants in both terminals, but there didn't seem to be enough seating at the gates, especially in A terminal. There were people standing around all over the place blocking the aisles, and hardly any place to sit at the gates.
Sky Harbor Airport is very large and has an ample amount of food choices, shopping and seating.  . . We were very easily able to navigate thru security and to a lunch place before getting on our plane to head home.  The most confusing part of the process was checking in to get a boarding pass and checking luggage.  I'm not sure why this seemed so chaotic but I think that Southwest Airlines should probably look into the procedure here.. . Other than that, we found a good place to eat lunch and watch the remainder of the Chiefs/Chargers game.
I need to update my review of Phoenix Sky Harbor.. . I recently came here again after a 4-year hiatus.  This place has improved by leaps and bounds since 2010.  The terminals still make no sense but there are more food options (also not expensive) and security is a breeze.  They are trying out an "old-school" way of going through security where you don't have to remove electronics and/or liquids from your carry-on.  You also don't have to remove your shoes!  I was one of the lucky people randomly chosen to have their hands wiped down and tested on some sort of machine (they allowed me to get on my plane so I guess I was clean?).  The security line only went slow because people were unsure of going through security with their feet covered with footwear.  Overall, still not the best airport but also not the worst.
I've been through this airport several times and it's pretty easy to find your way around if you look at a map layout first.
I do love this airport - I would give it 4 stars 2 reasons - if the lanes in Terminal 4 arrival area didn't congest so awful and merge to one lane. Need better security at baggage claim, no reason bags are being stolen still in this day.  . Very smooth everything else.  Thanks for the hard work!
Love this airport. It may not be the largest international airport but it sure does have a great selection of restaurants (inside and outside of security) and it is very easy to navigate.
There are many things that make this the best airport in the world, first of which is the name. Sky Harbor - come on, that's awesome.. . But seriously, over the past few years, the airport has become THE spot for Phoenix's culinary trendy and elite. Whatever you're in the mood to shove down your throat while your waiting in line to board, Sky Harbor has it. Four Peaks is obviously the best, but everything is super good.. . In case youactually go to airports to fly, the airport side of things are really nice, too. Security never takes too long and the drop off/pick up is usually painless.. . Take all of this with a grain of salt since this is my hometown airport and I might be a little biased. Just kidding, Sky Harbor really is the greatest and best of all airports. All other airports can suck it.
This airport is easy to manuver through.  Crowds are not really bad and there are agents standing, waiting to assist you for every airline.
Very good restaurants inside the airport.  They have a self fill water station near many of the bathrooms which means they are eco friendly.  And very good service over all.
Taken many flights over the years never had an issue yet!
Favorite Airport!
Again... typical airport. Many restaurants to chose from, but no Dunkin Donuts (big deal for me). Very clean with friendly staff. It is HUGE and takes a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes!
Always clean and some of the best food choices of any airport inside the US.. . Security is usually easy without the long lines I've experienced at most other large airports of this size.
Clean and updated, but seriously lacking signs and maps between or en route to different gates and concourses. Not enough people to help out our answer questions either.
Nothing special to see here, it's an airport.  I've got no complaints.
nice airport
This is a pretty organized airport. I never seem to have difficulty finding my terminal. Once you understand the general layout of the airport its easy to get around. They have cell phone lots that announce when an airplane has landed which makes it so much easier when you are waiting to pick someone up.
Sky Harbor isnt so bad in the world of airports. I live in Phoenix so I'm usually just in and out but everything is usually really quick and painless. What makes sky harbor stand out is the restaurant selection. They have awesome spots past security like local pizza joint Sauce as well as a cartel coffee lab which is a popular local coffehouse as well. . . If you can, make sure you check in online and try to carry on your bags because the lines can get crazy long, especially around holidays. Security is usually pretty quick and they have a lot of lanes open which is nice. I've come 45 mins before flight time and still made it out on time (although I dont recommend it!). . Pro tip:  If you use Southwest you can skip lines and check in at one of the self service kiosks at the top of the escaltors right before you get to the security lines.
Yeah!!!
The biggest complaint I have with this airport involves the car access; whether picking up or dropping off, this is a difficult airport to navigate. I get lost finding the proper exit ramps. . . Once one finds their way inside, though, it is straightforward enough, and their are pretty good options for food. I usually eat at La Grande Orange when waiting for a plane.. . The WiFi provided by the airport is spotty.
The airport is small and easy to get through!
It's an airport, so there isn't much else to say.  The volunteers who work in the terminals (wearing purple jackets) are helpful in assisting travelers with directions etc.  Bathrooms are usually clean.  Good selection of restaurants and shopping.  Wi-Fi is unpredictable.
made my connection without fuss, and had a beer at a place I can't remember the name of, but it was a local brewery I think.  Good beer.
This airport is huge so make sure you bring your walking shoes! There are moving walkways which is nice, but it still takes so long to get around (even within the same terminal). My biggest qualm is that  there are only a few restaurants in each gate area and no central dining area. I was in the mood for Chinese so it took me 30 mins walking each direction to get it!
Hallelujah. This place was a Godsend after a bad experience at the Oakland Airport overnight. One thing that especially surprised me about the Phoenix airport was just how busy it was - truly a sea of humans - I couldn't figure out if the hallways were narrower or what the deal was because it felt twice as busy as say Denver. (maybe there are more connections here and I am oblivious?)  Both dining and shopping options in this airport are favorable. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable my lunch of a fresh mozzarella and tomato sandwich and pasta salad were for under $9 at the French Country Market cafe. . . Wifi is free but I seemed to have some issues holding on to a strong signal. It may just depend on where you find yourself in the airport and how many fellow laptops and phones are draining the system. Bathrooms were nice and complete with much-needed hooks for hanging bags. My favorite part of the Phoenix Airport was probably the backdrop of the mountains as you land and take off as well as through the big windows throughout the terminals.
Of all the airports in this part of the country, Phoenix Sky Harbor has to be the easiest to get in and out of--even during the busy season.  I'm sitting at Terminal 4 Baggage Claim right now.  If your flying in, chances are you'll be coming to this terminal.  Eighty per cent (80%) of all flights in or out of Sky Harbor come through this terminal.  It is home to both US Air and Southwest Airlines.   The audio overhead says it's the friendliest airport in America. ..and I just may have to agree.  Look for the friendly seniors wearing purple jackets for information.  If you have to retrieve checked baggage,  go down the escalator as soon as you exit security.   When you get downstairs, you'll see some display boards which will have your flight listed as well as the carousel where your bags are located.  SW Airlines bags will be on the even numbered carousels,  while US Air releases their bags on the odd numbered carousels.   Terminal 4 is cool in that baggage claim even has its own Starbucks...complete with ample leather chairs.  It's a great place to rest up while you wait for a ride, bags or your connecting flight.
I had a layover here coming from Long Beach, going to NYC. It was during July... at 10 PM we could feel the outside heat indoors lol. Going in between terminals was kind of a hassle as everything is a far walk from each other. However they looked like there was a decent selection of food options; if I had extra time, I would have taken advantage of the light rail to check out Downtown.. but my layover time was only 2 hours... that actually got extended to 4 hours. US Airways, why do you gotta have delays all the time?
I spend  a lot of time at Phoenix Sky Harbor and it is a great airport. It is easy to maneuver. The signs are clear. The parking works. The cell lot is easy to find. I have not used the train...but I will!
I may not be a world traveler but I know a good airport when I see one. PHX is the baby bear of airports...meaning its not too big, not too small, but just right. This airport has four terminals, so depending on which airline you use, you could have a fab experience or a completely drab one. I checked in about an hour too early so I was able to explore a little bit between terminals. Terminal three is like a mix between a mall food court and a ghost town. There's a sbarro and a few security check points and some gift shops. Once you get through the checkpoint you walk through the gate area where nothing is open and there is a drink vending machine. All the restaurants are closed during the day and evening and the gift shops seem like they haven't been open in months. If you take the shuttle out to terminal four, its like you are at a completely different airport. . . Terminal four is more modern, new, and filled with restaurants made popular in Phoenix. There's a Lo-Lo;'s Chicken and Waffles there so if you missed the opportunity to stop at the actual restaurant in the city, definitely grab something here. There are also some cool shops and more people in this terminal. It's very clean and there are a lot of security and general staff personnel available to direct you. . . There is a shuttle that stops every few minutes at the terminals so if you have the time, take the shuttle to explore the various locations at the airport. It's a great time killer if you are super early for your flight or have a long layover. . . Overall, this terminal is spacious, clean, has helpful staff, and it takes about 10-15 minutes to get through security. The food options are ample and it's a pretty great representation to Phoenix.
Great airport, thankful for the many times it allowed me to travel safely.
