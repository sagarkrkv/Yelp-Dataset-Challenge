I had heard so much about Pizzeria Bianco and only thought the pizza was average.  It's a very small restaurant and the wait can be long.  I just don't get the hype.
Pizzeria Bianco of Pane Bianco (Central Ave) are great. Great food and friendly people to be around. You out-of-towners have to make sure this one's on you visit list.
Great pizza!  I could compare it to the Pizza I've eaten in Little Italy in NYC.  Great place
Nice gem in downtown Phoenix. Rosa pizza was a bit nutty but the Margherita was on point. Farmhouse feel is nice.
I remember Bianco's before the hype and can't bring myself to suffer the crowds and horrendous wait for a pizza. Not knocking it, it's a good pizza - but it's a pizza. . . I cringe when out of town guests suggest going here and I carefully steer them to Cibo or  Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana. Both are just as good and at Pomo you get that amazing limoncello. . . Bianco's is the Trevi fountain of pizza in Phoenix.
OK, we've all heard the hype regarding Bianco. So, I went, I ate, I enjoyed. I ordered the margherita (tom, mozz & basil) and the wise guy (roasted onion, smoked mozz & fennel sausage). The service is fast. I went around 2 pm, after the lunch rush and it still felt like the lunch rush.. I am from New Haven, CT where pizza is serious business and people will stand in line (rain or shine or even snow) for a pie from their favorite place. New Orleans has their trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper) and New Haven has the trinity as well: Pepe's, Sally's and Modern.. Anyway, back to Bianco. The the pies were excellent. For me, it starts with the crust. It was thin, very flavorful and held together with a firm texture that didn't just fall apart in your mouth. Kind of reminded me of the pies back home. The edge of the crust was puffy, crispy and had a few really dark spots. It was delightful. The sauce on the margherita was superb. Simple, not too thick, not too thin and adhered to the crust really well. The flavor combos on the wise guy were perfect. I like a little kick and would have added it if it were available. I never had the chance to ask our waiter as he was busy and did not check in on us.. My only criticism is that the menu is what it is. Unlike the majority of the pizza universe, you can not create your own combination at Pizzaria Bianco. Aside from this, Pizzaria Bianco makes a fabulous pizza.
I love the pizza. I think Chris Bianco is a hell of a nice guy... I have lots of good things to say about this restaurant. However, the wait times remove a star for me. And some of you may think that's silly, but let's not forget, they could have outdoor seating, and they have a whole bar- in which they refuse to serve you pizza. You can only get pizza in one special area, and until then, buy lots of drinks. I think it's a great business plan, but not my favorite eating plan.
The pizza is fantastic.  You can't beat their quattro stagione pizza. Their secret is the tomato sauce which is truly authentic Italian pizza style.
Summary:  worth a stop, especially for dinner. . . I got the Sonny (salami/olives/tomato sauce).  . . Crust - has great crunch on bite, and very soft on the inside. Charred but not burnt, and never feels like too much dough. . . Sauce and toppings have the salty bite you hope for, complements the crust very well. . . Service was good - personable enough and relatively prompt. I went during non-peak hours though. . . I didn't have any salads, apps, desserts, or drinks since I was in a bit of a rush. . . It's not cheap (especially for a lunch), but it is good - I'm more likely to do it as a dinner next time. . . Note:  parking is Valet only (unless someone has a yelp tip).
First off, Connor in valet service was superb.  You should keep that guy around as long as you can!  . . I ordered the margherita pizza.. . Sauce- top notch borderline perfection, although i don't know what perfection is, the best around is from my parents garden, so i have super super high expectations and it was best in a long time.. . Basil- UNBELIEVABLE, they must work hard to get the right type or grow it themselves, I should of ordered extra basil.  that right there was worth the cost of admission so to speak.. . Mozzarella- yep, it's got it, no complaints.  . . Crust- compliments the whole arrangement.
Cool atmosphere in a cool part of town and the food isn't bad either. Actually it's great. Service was fast and friendly. I had the Rosa. Pistachios on a pizza, who would have thought? It was great! I will definitely be back.
Maybe it was a busy day since it was Rainbow Fest. Still, the crust was incredibly thin and burnt. They skimped on the tomato sauce leaving it rather dry. I felt cheated of $20 for a pizza I could have easily attempted and burned just as well as them.. . tl;dr. . Its overly expensive, burnt, and not enough tomato sauce. . . Best pizza ever . . 10/10.
We stopped in on a Friday night and they were packed. They had a waiting area next door with live music and they offer beer and cocktails. We enjoyed it for about 30 minutes before we were called to be seated. They seated us at the end of the bar, which was fine. Whatever got us in fastest.. . We had the Sonny pizza, and it was delicious. The crust was just right. It stood up when you picked up a slice (I HATE flimsy pizza). It was still soft on the inside with a touch of char from the oven. The toppings and sauce were delicious. The only thing that we thought could have been improved was the mozzarella. It was very mild tasting with a slight taste of scrambled eggs. Service was good.. . All in all, it was a satisfying meal and I would recommend it.
This is supposed to be one of the best pizzas in the U.S. We came on a weekday for a late dinner which worked out because there was no wait.. . We were quickly greeted and served complimentary bread (which was good). . . We started off with the cheese with prosciutto and arugula appetizer. The combination of all the flavors meshed well and the prosciutto was pretty fresh. . . We ordered the margherita pizza and the Wise Guy with mushrooms. My recommendation would be to not order the mushrooms on the Wise Guy because it made the center soggy. The margherita pizza was the better one of the two. The pizza was really good, but I have to say, I still think NY has better pizza.
I can honestly say this is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. . . My husband and I went in, after a coworker of his told us about how amazing the pizza was at Biancos. So we decided to give it a try. Unlike many of the other people reviewing, we did not have to wait for a table since we went on a Tuesday afternoon.. . Not knowing what to expect at first we ordered one pizza to share. Half wiseguy and half margarita with mushrooms. Both were very good even though I preferred the margarita pizza. Just not a fan of the whole onions and what not. Everything just felt really fresh. I really liked their black tea as well even without sugar it tasted just fine.. . We're planning another trip to Biancos soon, but this time we might take a couple of friends to enjoy it with us.
This place is very hyped and I will say it was very good but nothing worth waiting 3-4 hours for. The wine was tasty and service was prompt but do yourself a favor and come for lunch when there is no wait.
An overview of the food we ordered:. . Ham wrapped cheese sticks - fantastic. Caprese salad - nothing special, pretty regular. Arugula salad - very good. Sonny pizza (salami and olives) - delicious - thin crust and the right ratio of sauce to toppings. Flourless chocolate cake - also delicious but I wish it would have come with ice cream and not this weird melted cream thing on the side.. . This place was packed,  which is always a restaurant's greatest recommendation. Nice decor, very clean, and reasonable prices. Two of us with all that food got out of there for about 60 bucks.. . I would definitely come back.
This is by far my favorite restaurant in the valley! The mozzarella basil pizza and a glass of malbec are my own little slice of heaven. I love the atmosphere and the authentic feel of everything here.
I have had a couple of really great experiences at Pizzeria Bianco so far. I really enjoy the menu. I think the staff is great. They have a couple of locations, which is really nice. . . Surprisingly, I wasn't so thrilled with the pizza. It was just "okay" both times. I've tried the Rosa and the Margarita and both left me feeling like I was lacking. However, the fresh mozzarella salad is amazing and I get it every time. I would certainly recommend people to this place.
I have finally had this one of kind pizza, the wait long after many attempts I finally made in the door.  I do say it was delicious, and more than amazing. I love olives and they did not disappoint in the menu selections. Recommend the place, regardless the bumper car crowd.  Over A pluss.
I wanted to see what the big deal was and I finally budged and tried Pizzeria Bianco. It's definitely different and the oven brick pizza is okay but not delicious. It was burned pretty bad and half of the pizza was so hard that I couldn't even bite it. I don't know if this is normal or not but I gave it another try for a second time and it just didn't make my list. I believe this place is overrated and the wait for it is not worth it. There are way better and tastier oven brick pizzerias around the Phoenix Metropolitan area. Not impressed.
This was one of the most recommended places to eat at while inPhoenix. It is always compared to the LA staple Pizzeria Mozza, which serves a mean Fennel Sausage Pizza.. . WISE GUY ($18). - Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage. - cooked to perfection. - I enjoyed every last bite of it. - The onions really brought out the flavor of the fennel sausage. - Definitely recommend!. . SERVICE: I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly. All the staff members seem to enjoy working with each other to help the customers are happy. I didn't know there was bread offered but the bartender highly recommended that I try the bread with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.. . ENVIRONMENT: very casual. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Depending on the day outdoor seating may be a great option while sipping a glass of wine or draft beer. Inside dining may be a little cramped but the pizza will definitely make up for it!. . Overall, I would NOT hesitate to visit Pizzeria Bianco again. The pizza was crispy and well flavored. I even hear if you're lucky you'll see Chef Chris Bianco making your pizza himself! The prices are similar to any fine pizzeria establishment. There is valet for the rich and famous, otherwise a parking lot free for 2 hours with validation.
