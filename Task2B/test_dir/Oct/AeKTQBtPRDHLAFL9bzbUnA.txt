Had the magnum roll and the supreme salmon roll. Both were delicious! Hubby had the screaming orgasm which was sooo tasty!!
This is my go to sushi spot when I'm in Vegas!! Absolutely love it here. The food is really fresh all the time. The hostess Arpi is really awesome. She's very nice and chill and remembers all the regulars. See you next time I'm in town!
Fresh sushi with fast, friendly service. They have all you can eat appetizers, sushi and desserts for lunch and dinner. Everything is made when you order it! I highly recommend Goyeman!
Thanks Yelpers for another wonderful suggestion. While I don't partake in the AYCE, the menu items have a been really freaking good. I don't know what they do to the tempura shrimp but I am addicted! The best part is that the rolls are not only super-tasty but they're not overly huge with too much rice. It's the perfect stuff-your-gob size and allows me to get two rolls instead of just one. Yum!!!
WORST SERVICE EVER.. . This one's for you IRVING (waiter of the night)!. . 30-40 minutes to even get noticed (yes we timed him)??? Very unacceptable!!! No apologies, only a butt-hurt attitude to add the "cherry on top"... . What really set me off is.... It is FREEZING in the restaurant, all I asked for was miso soup.. Had to order it twice, almost a 50 min wait for MISO SOUP, and again... Even after the issue was brought up kindly-- no apologies .... . Even the guy refilling the waters was more attentive than IRVING... . How frustrating for something that could've easily been fixed ...
I went here Oct 7th. I just moved to vegas few month ago. Tried to find good place eat. So I'm always seaching on yelp to find something good. So I find this place a lot a people said food n service is good. But it wasnt good at all.  I had a AYCE. Fish quality wasnt good. N employees looked so mad no smile.  Never ever wanna go back.
I admit I come here too often. With an abundance of AYCE sushi spots this one has quickly became my default. I used to live in the southwest next to another sushi place, that I won't name, but have stopped going there in favor of goyemon. . . The Cajun albacore and pepper tuna nigiri are my favorite items on the menu. Either way you can't go wrong their ayce menu covers a wide range of nigiri and apps. My only advice is to go early, the queue can get pretty long around dinner time.
I love Goyemon! It's my favorite sushi restaurant. The sexy girl is my favorite roll! It's just so delicious. I also love the salmon belly nigiri. The white tuna melts in your mouth. . . I love the unlimited dessert options that are available. I usually get the lychee sorbet and the yuzhu sorbet. The lychee is much sweeter, so eat that one first. People typically order the green tea creme brule, but I don't like green tea. . . Always look at the daily specials so you can see the specials like salmon belly or the different desserts that are available. . . I ordered the Calamari was on the specials board. That was disgusting. It did not look or taste like calamari that I would normally order at other restaurants. I normally like the pork belly, but the ones that came out was so horribly greasy  and oily. . . This visit, I would rate probably 2.5- 3 stars. But since I generally love this sushi restaurant, I would give it 3.5 starts rounded to 4 since I love the dessert there!
Great all you can eat sushi place in Las Vegas. . It's true that the waiting time is a bit long; however, once you are seated good quality sushi make your tongue happy. I like the fact that they have daily specials and Japanese draft beer. Most of the sushi is not over-seasoned which is great because you can taste the fish not just the sauce. Been going there since they opened and I'll continue going there. Friendly service and great sushi!!!
My mother came to town and wanted to try this place out.  We did the AYCE.  Which I recommend.  We probably saved  about $60. Customer service is great, they were very attentive. Food is great.  Dessert is included in the AYCE so that's a plus.  I don't recommend the ahi poki. There's about 4 pieces of ahi in there and a bunch of seaweed. It's a small restaurant with lots of tables.  So other tables conversation could be heard.
I usually come here when I have AYCE dates with my friends (6+ people). The wait is usually long during busy hours and the weekends. Despite having a table reserved, all members of your party must be present to actually start sitting in your table. But once we do we eat like no tomorrow lol!. . I mostly just order handful amounts (as in like 20pcs or more) of Cajun Albacore and Salmon Belly. Sometimes White Tuna. Let's not forget almost every piece of dessert (Mochis, Green Tea Creme Brulee, Yuzu Ice Cream). OOOOOH DELICIOUS~
One of the best AYCE Japanese in town.  . . We arrived around 6pm and there's a line already, the wait will be 30 mins & i left my number for them.  I received a text from Goyeman immediately and we can check how many people ahead of us by noshlist.com, very convenience! . . We got seated at the sushi bar area, that is the best seats if u have a small party.  We ordered sushi from the sushi chef and appetizers from the server.  Our server was very attentive and patient to explain the menu to us, the chef was great too, he kept feeding us (lol) and made sure we got all our orders.  . . Quality of the sushi is superb! Fish is fresh, sushi had the right portion of fish and rice, and chefs did great jobs on the presentation as well.  Salmon kama was very juicy and not dry at all.  Grill calamari, shitaki mushroom, gyoza, tofu were delicious as well! . . Sadly we can only order 1 sweet shrimp & 1 uni suchi per person, because they are really goooood... And if u want soft shell crab, it has to come with a roll, cant order just by itself.  No oyster on the menu either.  . . Green tea creme brulee was good but hubby preferred the coconut mochi.
Goyemon!!!!!! My favorite sushi place in town!!! It's a bit on the small side and is always packed! The place does not take reservation so expect to wait a while during peak busy hours. However the place is so worth it. . First things first, if you're not doing AYCE then there is no point coming here. Other than that if you got a big appetite and looking to satisfy your craving for Japanese sushi then this is the place to go! Everything here is really good. If you're into the Nigiri sushi, you have to definitely order the SUPER white tuna, Cajun albacore, seared salmon, sea urchin....ahhh whatever just order everything!!!! Also if you like ramen you should come here after 11pm since that is when it is added to their menu. . . I love this place! I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the long wait times.
One of the best sushi places in LV. This place is always super busy and after eating here I now know why. . Seating: Fortunately when I did eat here, I was seated right away. I went on a Sunday around 1pm; it was busy but luckily there was a table for two that had just opened. I foresee the wait time definitely being an issue in the future because even just 20 minutes into being seated there was a good 10 people waiting for a table. The place is smaller than most sushi restaurants I've gone to so that doesn't help. . . Service: pretty good. I saw a lot of reviewers saying that the waiters aren't attentive but I had no issue at all with it. My water was refilled more than a couple times and the food was brought out in a timely manner (about 15-20 minutes for sushi and 5 for the soup and salad).  It was pretty busy at this time but I imagine that if it was even more busy, service wouldn't be as quick. . . Food: my sister and I did not have the AYCE and believe me, it is STILL WORTH IT. The lunch specials are really a highlight of the menu; if you aren't hungry enough for AYCE or you don't feel like spending the $22 it's a great option. The rolls available on the lunch menu aren't the most intricate in flavors but for a basic roll it's a win. We had spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls; spice level was on par with other sushi bars I've been to and serving size was a little better than average. Lunch specials also include miso soup and salad! A total win for a complete lunch without breaking the bank. . . Would absolutely return and plan on it in the very near future!
I was extremely disappointed by this restaurant the fish was disgustingly warm and mushy. The appetizer was edible to say the least. I don't quite understand why this place has such high reviews it was mediocre at best. I'll say the price is a little much for the poor quality of fish. . . Bottom line don't trust the high ratings and skip on to the next.
Like the blackboard specials...good super white, great shrimp heads, real snow crab,. Ramen soup after 11pm...
amazing sushi great service wow price will be there again and again and again
I've ate there many times before and it's my all time favorite sushi place in Vegas! Great service and the best sushi I've ever had.
One of my favorite places to each sushi because honestly, my high school teacher recomended this place to me when he heard I was going to Vegas for college. LOL! But it's not the only place I eat sushi at. I like the dimness of the room but not so much the price. I'm pretty sure I could eat AYCE sushi else where for cheaper. This is just one of those retaraunts I would save for a rainy day or date night. Lol. . . Other than that they have some interesting rolls and seasonal interior decor which is pretty cool. They also have a bar, you dont have to be 21 to sit there, but it is an overall clean and nice environment. Cool chefs behind the bar as well! Lol. . . Keep in mind that this place gets packed on weekend nights especially, im not sure about during the day but it's all good. It's worth a 20 minute wait max. Haha
Went in for dinner tonight asked if we could watch the world series and the server said sorry its on a set channel we are not allowed to change it. Last time I go back
