I came to dinner here with a friend and sat at the bar. The Bartender was very welcoming and made excellent drinks!!. . We came for happy hour and after agreeing on 3 food items, the bartender had the order in before we even told him!! Great ears!! . . Couldn't have asked for better service was excellent and the food was just as good!. . We will definitely be back!!
Excellent food and a beautiful restaurant. Nice upscale but casual atmosphere with  creative menu items. Very professional and polite staff. Nice open air  patio/bar area that is great for a drink and conversation with friends.
Tried this place for the first time after seeing on Diners, Drive ins,and Dives . Love the breakfast and the service was superb. Highly recommend! Only wish they had all the breakfasts during the weekdays. First time I went they were not serving the breakfast I had come to try.
Pretty good lunch place, haven't tried it for any other meals.  The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was good.  There are some unique offerings on the menu.  It's a small place, so when the windows are closed it can be a little loud.
This place is awesome. I'm still sitting here finishing a perfect Old Fashioned and a veggie flatbread with super fresh, fragrant veggies and herbs with amazingly creamy goat cheese. . . Bartender is lovely, ambience is chill and classy. This place is great all around.
Romaine hearts w a delicious buttermilk dressing goes perfect with the Bacon and corn.. . Moroccan spiced meatballs are a true treat.. . Even a local (yes, Arizona) red wine that's not only surprisingly good but better than a lot of California's.. . Do I look forward to a return? In the words of Bart scott, "can't wait!"
Best Cheeseburger I ever ate. Ever and I've eaten a lot...
I don't write many reviews, but St. Francis is one of the best foodie joints I've been too. Knowledgeable staff and great use of ingredients. Had the Pig Dip and am thinking about coming back for dinner. Definitely will come back next trip to Phoenix.
Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?. . I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other. . . I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.. . I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad. . . Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?! . . On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.. . A few notes to St. Francis operations.. Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.. . Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?. . Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.. . I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.. . . Happy Yelping Phoenix!
Nice, little trendy restaurant with complimentary valet service.  I almost couldn't believe that it was complimentary and my mother kept trying to give the guy some money for parking our car.. . Upon entering, we were immediately attacked by some wood or bark that fell off a top shelf and almost nailed my mom.  I helped pick up the mess before we were shown to our table.. . We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, but they let us move to a better table near the back.. . Water came out a few minutes later, which is a good sign.. . We ordered a few drinks from the HH menu: an almond margarita and some type of lemonade, cucumber concoction.  . . I didn't care for the cucumber drink, so I stole the margarita from my mom.. . I specifically wanted to try their Pig Dip sandwich, because I had seen it on Triple D and Guy raved about it.. . The Pig Dip is not on the HH menu, but their kitchen approved my request.  We also decided to try their Moroccan meatballs.. . Okay, the plates are huge and make it difficult to navigate due to the small size of their tables.  I'm not referring to the portions. I'm talking about the strange wood plates they use when serving hot dishes straight out of their wood-fired oven.. . Now, the food really leaves a lot to be desired.  At this point, I had been enjoying myself, but the food detracted from the overall experience.. . The meatballs have a decent flavor, but they are INCREDIBLY salty.  I probably wouldn't order them again.. . The Pig Dip sandwich is served with an au jus-like sauce and French fries.  The fries were absolutely delicious, but the au jus had too much vinegar or something.  It made the sandwich taste terrible and I couldn't figure out what it was until I stopped dipping my sandwich in that awful stuff.. . The Pig Dip by itself isn't too bad, but it certainly isn't one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  It isn't even in my top 5.  This was slightly depressing, because Guy made it seem like something special.  It clearly wasn't.. . It also cost $16, which makes it one of the most overpriced sandwiches I have ever had.. . Listen, St. Francis, I have eaten far better sandwiches than your Pig Dip for almost half the price.  I realize that you make most of the ingredients in-house, but that is just a ridiculous price for an average sandwich.. . In sum, St. Francis offers an interesting combination of products, a great HH menu, and utilizes attractive decorations to make their customers feel comfortable.. . I would probably go back.
A hidden gem! Everything great! Food, service, atmosphere, MARTINI'S..... WOW.  The fingerling potato appetizer is huge,, enough for 5-6 I think.  The toffee dessert was the best, even if you think you are full,, GET IT!
I've been here a handful of times and always had a pleasant experience. Until I went to the brunch. We had 6 people and reservations, so we were seated immediately. I thought we waited slightly longer then we should have to place our orders, but everyone is talking & having fun so I wouldn't mark that against them. I didn't see any $5 cocktails as mentioned in another review. That is something I usually enjoy in most central Phx brunch spots. . So we order and no joke it took 1 hour to get our food. The server never once apologized or even commented about the wait until we asked. He told us since we were a large party the kitchen gets backed up. 6? Is a large enough party to throw off the entire kitchen? When we did finally get our food, 4 of us were served and the other 2 waited for 5 more min.... Even though they were the same dishes as the next person. . The food was good, never had a problem with that part. . This is when we probably bothered the server by asking him to split charges on 4 different cards. 2 were a couple & 1 had cash. Gratuity was included so we told him exact amount to charge on every card. Equally divided, doubled for the couple. He took the time to identify who's card belonged to who, but when he rang it up, realized it didn't add up (cuz of missing cash) instead of walking the 10 feet to table to double check, he decided to divide it evenly among cards. Ugh we already had this figured out. He came back and everyone was upset about it. He then got snippy and said well I have to refund everyone and redo it. Yes you do. A simple walk over when amounts didn't match up would have saved a lot of time. I allowed myself 1hr & 45 min to have brunch and get to my next engagement. 2hrs and 15 min later we were still getting the check mess figured out. This was not due to lingering & drinking. This was how long it took to get us food and get us out the door. . I really should have spoke to the manager, but I just didn't want to be the a second longer. I was over an hour late to next event :(
We love to come here, their menu is great..very cute urban place. Great location as well.
Roasted chicken is amazing. Nice crispy outside and juicy inside. . . Was in a hurry to catch a flight and the server made the effort to get me in and out as quickly as reasonably possible (about a 45 min meal). . Will have to go back to try other dishes
