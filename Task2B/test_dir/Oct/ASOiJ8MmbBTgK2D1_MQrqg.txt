Dinner here on September 02, 20124, reservations for 8:30 pm. My husband had the bone-in rib eye with bone marrow, and I had the prime aged new york strip, we shared the duck confit salad, also had the croquettes and a caramel souffle. The steaks were amazingly robust and cooked to perfection, each bite succulent.  The view, ambiance and amazing server created one of my best dining experience. Our server knew the menu well, even as to the number of days our steaks were wet/dry aged. This was my second time here, the first was for a friend's birthday. This restaurant holds incredible memories for me and I look forward to celebrating here for the coming years. Definitely reccomend.
Table was wobbly the whole dinner.  Souffle was served with no side plates.  They expected me and my whole party to bump spoons when sharing the souffle for dessert.  Waited 10-15 minutes for the side plates to be brought out.  By that time the souffle was cold.  Currently waiting another 20 minutes for another souffle to be cooked.  Not happy with the service or condition of the dinning area.
The service was good but the food wasnt. The beef wellington was beyond bland, and the halibut wasnt any special either. The warm foie gras and the salad was the only 2 good dishes. For dessert, we got the chocolate platter which was super disappointing since it was recommend to us by the waitress. The Lava cake was dry and overcooked, the chocolate ice cream was nothing special and the mousse was quite sweet
Very good and expensive, go for the view, especially during the fountain show. Wine list was great, steaks and sides were great. Expected.
Management is awful. We had a reservation for 9 pm and were there at 8:45 Pm, but we were not seated till 11 PM. By the time we got table we were tired of standing and waiting, so we just wanted to finish our dinner as soon as possible and crash in the hotel room. I won't recommend this place to anyone, if you are planning this restaurant for your date please reconsider. View from this restaurant is not worth the torture you have to go through
Fabulous fancy lunch!!. . We really enjoyed our lunch here on our last trip to Vegas. We had the kale salad, cheese platter, hamburger, and shrimp cocktail. Everything was to die for. . . Service was excellent... views were awesome... really nothing bad to say about this place.. . We will be back.
The best gastronomic experience ever! We tried the tasting menu offered by the chef, and we were amazed by each plate! The server Nick was excellent, we absolutely loved the experience!
Great view of the Bellagio Fountains!! Very romantic setting. For the price you pay, the food wasn't worth it though. I will tell you that the Eiffel Tower Experience drink was the best drink I've ever had. Make a reservation no matter what time you want to go... just to be sure you don't have to wait. And ask for a window seat.
Great athmosfere, service 5 star and food too.. The steak tartare was awesome. Also the vegetarian plates are at the top, for the vegan.. I spent my anniversary and i recommend it... And with the table in front of the Bellagio is outstanding.
