My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for his 38th birthday. His all-time favorite meal is very simply, a steak and potato. I did my diligent research and decided on Del Frisco's for a special night out. I made an Open Table reservation for 6PM, as we had a show to catch later on that evening. I made a small notation in the reservation that it was his birthday but didn't think anything more of it.. . That evening, we arrived and were warmly greeted by the friendly hostess. She wished my BF a happy birthday and chatted with us for a moment before another hostess took us to our table. . . On our table was a birthday card, hand-signed by the entire Del Frisco's staff, and our server came over immediately and introduced himself. He, also, was named Matt and just celebrated his 38th birthday, so it was quite humorous. He was very friendly and attentive the entire night, giving us recommendations when asked, but never was pushy.. . We decided on the seafood plateau for an appetizer. We both had the VIP drink -- a must try. The seafood was absolutely perfect. The sauces that accompanied the seafood were also to-die-for!. . After a quick chat with Matt the server about what type of steak we like best (my BF prefers marbling and taste over tenderness), we made our choices. I ordered one of the specials of the evening -- a trio of filets, each with a different topping. My BF ordered the Waygu bone in steak. We also ordered a baked potato side, although it merely out of habit to have an accompaniment.. . In between courses, we were always checked on, crumbs wiped away, water refilled, and drinks brought out when asked. It was superior service, and I don't exaggerate. . . Our entrees were brought out and the steaks were beautiful. My BF's Waygu looked like it could have been off of a dinosaur it was so large! The taste, though, was unlike anything I've had...and I love a great steak. Juicy, flavorful, and tender. It couldn't be beat.. . My filet trio was divine as well. After a couple of drinks and the seafood appetizer, I could only tackle one of the filets. (I'm a notoriously small eater) I really wanted to stuff myself, but knew better, especially since the night was still young. . . My BF tackled his entire steak and, I think, his eyes rolled back into his head a few times in sheer bliss. He was a happy boy! :). . We took a few obligatory bites of the potato, but the meat is where it's at! . . We were asked if we had room for dessert, and, of course, we did now. However, we were brought a large slice of the house lemon cake with a candle. I tasted it, and, I swear, it was one of the most moist, delicate, delicious pieces of cake I have had -- and I'm a Southern girl who loves her sweets! It was the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness, not heavy at all. . . The server asked if we were staying somewhere that we could take back what we hadn't eaten (my two other filets, the potato, and most of the cake). We were, so he boxed everything separately and placed it in a bag for us. . . I consider myself a pretty keen foodie, and I am not easily impressed with showy foods or pomp and circumstance. I, however, was VERY impressed with both the service and food at Del Frisco's. . . Flash forward to two days after we were back home -- my BF received a hand written card from our server thanking us for celebrating at Del Friscos. THAT was impressive.. . We will definitely be back in next time we are in Vegas and recommend to anyone who wants their tastebuds to be spoiled rotten.
So far the BEST Steakhouse I've been to in Vegas the service was excellent the steaks are amazing comes to your table sizzling hot and the bar is pretty nice as well
we had dinner here on Saturday might with a party of five people. We were. Given such poor service by a waiter named Tommy. he had one of the worst . Attitudes of any server that I had in a upper scale restaurant in a long time.. The salad and the appetizers were marginal and the cocktails were weak and . Overrated. my father had the bone in cowboy steak that was like shoe leather. we waited over a. Hour to be served our dinner and were shocked by the poor service...... Amanda the manager on duty tried extremely hard to make up for,the deficiencies and offered the table desserts and a complimentary cocktail. . THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR,THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. THE WAITER . TOMMY SURELY DOES. NOT BELONG WORKING IN A RESTAURANT LIKE . THIS,OTHER THAN A ONE STAR DINER KN THE STRIP.
Great place. Took the wife for her Bday.  They even give u a free cake.  Order a banging steaks with a side of Asp. Can't go wrong.
Traditional steak house where sides are separate orders. Had the filet mignon and it was delicious. When they brought out the steak, they ask you cut it to make sure it is cooked to your liking. The steak is pretty good. I for one am not a big fan of filet mignon but this one was good. I am definitely a fan of this place now.
Heard many good things about this place but it just fell flat, aside from a very slow server to average tasting food I can't see myself coming back to this restaurant. The inside looks dated like an old 80s restaurant feel. You think for what you're paying the whole experience would be exceptional,  but far from the truth. The steak tartar was bland and poorly seasoned, I had a bone in ribeye for my entree which actually was decent but not enough to want me to return considering all the other choices around that part of Vegas. The lemon cake was good with no complaints there.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!. . The night my fiance and I got engaged, we had dinner here with my boss.. . but before he showed up. we had a few drinks at the bar! the bartenders were SO helpful and sweet and one even bought us a drink as a congratulations! . . their VIP martini was amazing. clementine vodka infused by Hawaiian pineapples. SO delicious!. . we each ordered the prix fixe and boss ordered the giant wagyu ribeye! the steaks were all amazing! . . the sides were pretty good as well. We had the crab cake, scallops, and mashed potatoes. and sauteed mushrooms.. . The crab cake was just meh. too heavy tasting. I really didn't see what all the hype was about.. . the scallops were delicious!. . Sauteed mushrooms were sauteed mushroom. :/. . the mashed potatoes were awesome!. . It was my fiance's birthday so they brought us out a HUGE slice of their lemon cake. absolutely AMAZING!. . I loved the food and the service!. . We will be back! :)
went here for a business dinner and loved it.  excellent meal!. . ok, let's start with cocktails.  they make a drink called the VIP, which is vodka infused with pineapple.  o m g.  it's amazing.  sooooooo good!! i would go back just because of it.  seriously. try it.  not at all what i was expecting.  it doesn't taste strong, but yowza it packs a punch.  good stuff!. . moving on to actual food.  onion rings.  i'm not an onion ring lover (don't dislike them either), but wow, these are incredible.  so well seasoned, and they don't taste like onion at all.  hard to describe, but really... they're pretty great.  i hear the fried oysters are to die for, but i'm not an oyster lover, so didn't try them (but my group ordered a second round - they were i guess THAT good).  steak, i went ribeye.  delicious and tender.  excellent.. . dessert.  hard to even imagine after all that other food, but yeah, we went for it.  i tasted the lemon cake.  very light and enjoyable.  it all looked fantastic.
Food and service is absolutely top notch- Great for business dinners or special occasions. I went to Del Frisco's for a business dinner, now I have to take the wife back. Pricey but worth it when you feel like splurging a bit-
Service is phenomenal! Their food is delish but I've fallen for their lobster Mac n cheese and I can't get up!! Once you're done with dinner, I recommend checking out their James Bond table!
The bad- Well for the price I expected more.  Don't get me wrong the food was good but boy was it expensive.  I dont usually eat at high end steakhouses because I can cook a steak at home.  We were out for a night on the town so why not splurge a little.  I think our server was not as experienced as the others.  I heard other servers articulating the menu as well as mentioning things that were not on the menu.  Ours did not do that.  The place smelled like sewage in the main area.  Luckily our section was fine.  The air conditioning was awfully cold.  We spent just under $200 once tip was added for my wife and I.  And that was without drinks.. The good- 32 oz was cooked and seasoned just the way I like it.  Its nice having a steak being served on an extremely hot plate.  Mashed sweet potato were really tasty.  And the asparagus was perfectly cooked and still crunchy.  The chocolate mousse was not overly rich tasty like many other places.
Fantastic service.Amazing food. Try the shrimp three ways and you must finish with a piece of lemon cake.
Grabbed a cab and headed over to Del Friscos arriving to find a dated kinda worn feel to it. Not comparable to a classy Chicago Steakhouse but more of a casual comes as you are feel,  The martini was well prepared and the portion was nice.. . I am one for aesthetics and the first one that grabbed me was that the salad fork is the same size as the dinner fork. Call me weird, but I like big man sized utensils  for $50 dollar steaks. . . Now about that crab appetizer.  Being from the wine country, I know I am spoiled but if a big hunk crab mixed with a monstrous amount of Old Bay is your thing, you have come to the right place.  I will eat crab served with cardboard I like it so much, but truly just so so.. . Next was the Wedge salad with blue cheese. This dish can be great when done right but if the lettuce is wet and leaking, the dressing and everything else turns mushy and bland.. . But, drums please, the steak shines.  There I was with my miniature fork drinking some great cab and enjoying the heck out of my tender flavorful steak with some pretty tasty corn, spinach and mashed potatoes. (Yes I did order three sides.). . So maybe skip everything else and have a steak.. . Great bartender was very well versed in the wine offerings and made the night a fun one.
