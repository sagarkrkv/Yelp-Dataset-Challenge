Definitely never staying here again. I booked a Stay Well suite a couple months in advance. We checked in after 3 and were given our room keys, but once we got in we realized it wasn't cleaned. There were sheets on the floor, food everywhere, CONDOM wrappers, just absolutely disgusting. I called the front desk and they told us they had nothing else available, even after asking twice, the girl said there were no room available we would have to wait for staff to clean our room. REALLY? The only other option was a 2 bedroom on the same floor. We were tired after the long drive and said fine.. . Going into the 2 bedroom we realized it was worse than the first. The closet was almost non existent, the lights flickered, the window shades were crooked. We were basically downgraded as their solution to not having our room ready.. . We went down to the front desk lugging our stuff with us and complained that we needed a new room. Magically one appeared, after I was told over the phone there were none available. They gave us a $50 credit for food. Whoop dee doo.. . We finally got into our room and felt like we would actually get to relax until we heard our neighbors. SCREAMING at the top of their lungs. I realize the hotel can't control guests but I couldn't help by wonder if we would be staying next to neighbors from hell if our first room had been ready when it was supposed to be. . . All in all a terrible experience. I'm not even looking for a comp or apology. I vote with my money. I will never stay at mgm ever again. I will tell my friends and co-workers so they wont be cheated by this place.
I had such a great time and an awesome experience at the MGM Grand Hotel.  We booked a suite in the Stay Well section of the hotel.  We arrived at the hotel a bit early and it wasn't a problem.  We walked into the Stay Well Lounge and we were greeted with cucumber water during our check in and we were immediately checked into our suite.  I highly recommend the City View Suite.  We did not have to wait in that long check in line that i saw as we walked into the lobby.  When we arrived in our suite  OMG, purified water, air filters, no smoke smell, no dust, turndown service, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne...I could go on and on, but that would be bragging.  Well in that case, let me go on and on...We wanted to see KA on a nightthat was sold out and the concierge made it happen, he also made our dinner reservations for us.  . . Everyone from our the housekeeping staff (they leave a note for you so you know who your housekeepers are), to the concierge, to the black jack dealer were so friendly and kind.  They almost made me forget that I lost a bunch of money during my stay...lol.  . . In any event, I highly recommend staying at the MGM Grand Hotel.  Request one of the "Stay Well" Suites.  It doesn't get better than this...well maybe the Skylofts, but that's another review that I will be writing in November :)  Stay tuned.... . xoxo,. Trish
Had a wonderful experience despite being apprehensive after reading so many poor reviews.  Here is my response to some of the common complaints:. 1. Check in.  Yes there was a line, it moved quickly , room was ready and charges were explained up front and check out was quick and accurate as well. 2. West Wing.  Yes it not luxury , but it suited our needs just fine, exits right onto the strip, comfy bed, room service was amazing.  Agreed that the bathroom set up is awkward and I would not recommend it if it's your first trip together as a couple or you are shy about your bowel habits (lol) but we will be back next year. We did not once smell cigarette smoke or the elevators which we were right beside. 3. Size of hotel.  Compared to our casinos in Connecticut, all the casinos here were small , so no... Did not feel that the walk to anything was an inconvenience. 4. Dinning:  we only ate at The Avenue... Breakfast was amazing .  Pricey... But it's vegas and I was on vacation.... So not an issue for me.  Otherwise there are several places we grabbed coffee and snacks( the crepes... To die for ) but if we wanted, there were plenty if choices and price ranges to choose from. 5. WiFi.  Perfect connection the entire stay. 6. Stolen items.  There is a safe in the room.  The hotel has them for a reason and you should always use them. Period.. . All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised and are hoping to make it back out within the next year!
I will tell you why the 2 stars; first for a hotel to have so many restaurant and have them closed down after 10:00PM is ridiculous. There was a LA Kings convention and the Harvest 91 3 day festival, tons of people with no where to eat but at McDonald's  and other low key establishments at the MGM? That's my main gripe.. . Second, while at the "Directors" pool the hostess on Sunday noon the 5th; a fat Hispanic women, walked pass me at least 6 times and never once asked if we needed drinks.  I had to go to the bar and order my drinks. There I could hear her gossiping about her fat a$$ fitting into a dress.. . Wolfgang Puck needs to step it up, the pizza margarita is not suppose to have sauce?. Maybe I am being to critical, but after partying and hungry you don't want to be told this is your only choice.. . Here's an idea?. You should have the restaurants rotate staying open late for your many patrons.. . The west wing hallways?  What was the idea behind making them so long?  What were you thinking? . . The check in was great no issues.. The room was fine.. The pools are in great shape.. I enjoyed the amenities while open.. Your automated Check out was a breeze. . Advise at check in, close to the elevators might not be so bad.... You guys did it right at Aria?
Their suites are so big and pretty! I stayedin the one bedroom suite and it's seriously big enough to fit 5+ people. The living room had a pull out bed. It had a dining room table. And the bathroom had a bathtub shower and a shower with double sinks! . . The only down side is the suite is the last room in the hallways so be prepared to make some hallways runs when you're drunk :) haha so much fun. . . Check out was at 11, but since I was super hungover the maid started cleaning a different room. Thank goodness for her!
Check-in was fast and simple, and the girl behind the counter was funny and cute. Everything in the casino is very convenient for those staying at the hotel, and there aren't any long walks to get to different services or amenities. . . The room itself was okay. My bed was very comfortable, and I like the automatic double curtains. The bathroom seemed a bit run down, however.
This hotel was a lot of fun. I love the focus on celebrity chefs. Food was great,,,,, don't eat at the buffet though.
I attended a conference at the MGM Grand and stayed there as well. I was impressed with the size and comfort of my room; housekeeping left my room spotless;  there was never any significant wait for an elevator (a problem at some mega-hotels); the ventilation was superb, I was never bothered by smoke; the support the hotel provided the conference was top notch.  There were issues with the conference itself but that had nothing to do with the hotel.  The Grand Buffet had very good food.   Check-in did involve waiting in line but that is Vegas for you.  I have three minor complaints.  One, service in the Lobby bar was slow even though it was not crowded. Two, the West Wing bar was never open even during posted hours.  Pity as it seemed like it would be a nice quiet place to have a drink.  Three, the David Copperfield show was frustrating as sight lines from my top-price seat were not that good.  I'll review that separately as well.  Oh, and the prices.  I paid almost twice as much for my Starbucks latte as I pay at home but again, that's Vegas!  Oh, and the damn "resort fee" which everyone is charging now.  It's a scam but what are you going to do?
While visiting Vegas I decided to stay here at the MGM even though they're many great hotels in Vegas. Check-in was okay, a bit crowded but they had many works at the check-in desks to accommodate everyone. I paid for early check-in because I had an early flight and didn't wanna walk around but check-in and rest up some. . . Everything was great while i was at the MGM besides the wait on food. They warned us that the food would take up to 30 mins to an hour to reach our room but the food was so good therefore it was worth the wait. I'll just think that since it a huge hotel with an up coming boxing match that they would be staffed to handled hugh crowds and hugh orders. Besides that again everything was great from the pools, rooms/bathrooms neat and clean. Just superb. I'll definitely be staying here on my next visit to Vegas just not during a hugh boxing match.
We were nervous about our stay following some of the negative reviews we read online.. . However we were pleasantly suprised with the quality of this hotel. We stayed in the staywell part of the hotel and the room was fantastic. Great bed, never had such a comfy bed in an American hotel before. . The room was new and the bathroom large,
Awesome hotel...especially during frozen fury, with all the kings fans around. . This hotel can get pretty confusing with the east and west wing and all the different elevators. Staff has always been great and rooms are very nice and very clean.
Just stayed here for a long weekend. Overall, a great experience. I was a little discouraged at check in when they did not have the King room I had reserved so they 'upgraded' me to a room with 2 queen beds but the room itself was bigger.  The room was clean and we were happy with it.. . You never really have to leave the hotel itself. Between the shops, the choice of restaraunts, and other things to do. The casino was my favorite out of Paris, Flamingo, Luxor, Harrahs.  It smells amazing! Lol I will say the resort itself and everything in it was always crowded, so if your're not into that. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.. . It is an easy walk to Ny Ny as well as Excalibur with an escalader and walkway. . . Beware there is a $200 hold on your card at check in! With lots of resort fees just like pther hotels.
We stayed at the MGM Grand for 3 nights with mixed reviews.  The staff was very friendly, helpful, and customer service oriented.  The casino was nice, your basic middle ground between the low and high end options on the strip, and the pool was very nice.  The lazy river was great, although we could have lived without the repetitive techno music playing poolside.  . . Our room was serviceable, but not great.  We were in the extended part of the west wing, and the room felt very thrown together.   We had a single king room; it was very small and generally lacking in amenities.  No refrigerator, no coffee maker, only 1 tiny window and truly terrible lighting.  My boyfriend commented that it felt like a David Lynch movie, and not in a good way.  It felt like night time even in the morning.  You want to be able to see yourself when you get dressed to go out.. . The bathrooms were the biggest challenge, though.  Very small, and completely lacking privacy.  When you enter the hotel room from the exterior hallway, you are in your bathroom.  The bathroom and the foyer are one and the same.  The shower was nice, but the only thing separating the toilet from the rest of the hotel room is a very thin glass door that doesn't close well. It feels very exposed.  Not great for a couple.  There was very little counter space And the lighting in the bathroom was honestly the worst I've ever seen in a hotel.  Very dim, green, and harsh.  The light is in the center of the mirror, so only half of your face is lit up.  Clearly not designed by someone who needs to put on makeup.  It's all stylish at a glance, but not designed with any thought for detail or function.. . Not sure if we would stay here again.  If we do, we would certainly request a room in a different part of the hotel.  Maybe some blocks are better than others.
Hubs and I stayed 10-7 thru 10-10. Booked the trip in January and have been fearful since booking due to the wild swings in reviews. I can say that we're completely satisfied with our stay.  . . It has been about 15 years since my one and only trip to Vegas and my husband had never been. We arrived on a Tuesday and figured out as the week wore on that this is THE day to check in without lines. Check in was quick and efficient. Everyday thereafter the lines got increasing longer. So I can't speak to anything other than my experience, which was great.  . . We stayed in a Grand King room in the West Tower. Our room was very nice and spacious. We had a decent view, clean room and comfortable bed. The blackout shades were great for late nights and sleeping in. The room stayed relatively cool, but a little warm under the covers. Maybe I'm just used to sleeping with a ceiling fan on at home. . . The facility is enormous and I joked that maybe we might have the layout memorized before we left. It is at on one far side of the strip and we liked it that way. The Hubs and I joked that we enjoyed watching the "crazy " further down the strip, but that it was nice that it wasn't right outside our door. We took the monorail that stops at the MGM to a lot of places and it was very convenient. . . We ate at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant after attending KA. Both of these experiences were great. It has been stated before and I will reiterate that they really do have just about everything you could possibly need in this facility. Lots of food choices whether you want fast food, fast casual, or fancy restaurants.   . . Join M Life, it really is worth it. The Hubs and I played quite a bit of blackjack and racked up a lot of points and enough comps to make it worth our while. Concierge was friendly and helpful as well as any other staff member we encountered.  . . Overall wonderful stay and I can't wait to come back.
A Grand Hotel with a large Golden Lion at the  door to greet you.  This is a heritage place on the strip with reasonable rate and maintained as part of a now larger casino group.  If you register in the MLife rewards program, you can get room rate and other discounts / rewards.  Nice location handy to the shows and other stuff on the strip.
Too big.  It takes forever to get anywhere.  . . The rooms are nice.  Service is prompt.  . . The overall decor feels dated.
We usually stay at the Encore and decided to give this place a try. The wait is crazy long to get a room key and they charge you extra if you want access to your room sooner! You end up spending about the same as the higher price hotels for less quality.  You don't even have tv's in bathroom and hotel feels dirty.
This is the worst hotel experience that I have had in Las Vegas.  The rooms were to be discounted 30% because we were coming in with a group, only to find out that we were charged the regular rate.  Please, this was no regular hotel room, it was a glorified motel room and when I inquired about the state of the room, I was informed that the rooms had simply been remodeled from the old Marina Motel/Hotel from many years ago and linked to the rest of the hotel.  If you are not clusterphobic, you will become one.  You walk in to the bathroom first and then get to your room.  The A/C unit is your nightstand.  The drawers for your clothes are old but painted, looks like something out of the fifties.  There is no room on the sink counter for you to put your brush let alone your make-up bag or anything else.  There are no hooks to hang anything.  After taking a shower, you need to walk into the bathroom stahl to grab a fresh towel, since there is no where to put it.  Why is the shelving for the fresh towels over the toilet seats, I couldn't begin to explain....  The chairs in the roms will give you vericose veins.  They are very uncomfortable. . Here is the great part, there is nothing that divides the bathroom from the bedroom really but a unsealed glass door.  So, watch out!  Should you have a bowel movement, expect to relish in the aroma for your entire stay since there is no aspirator or anything else to help vent the room.  The room is dark, the window is a 3'x3' opening.  It is a coffin.  Now for the bed.  Since it is impossible to sleep next to the air conditioning unit, everyone must sleep on the other side and therefore, the mattress is lumpy.  I went to management to express my disappointment and they really don't care....It is all about their bottom line and not about the guest experience and this guest will NEVER go back to the MGM or any of its affiliates.  Spare yourself the agony and go somewhere else.  Keep your dignity.. WiFi is free up to a limit.  You can pay $50/day for more data.  Really??????
The redesigned rooms are really nice, and the casino and restaurants are standard, nicely appointed Vegas offerings. The pools are still open in late October, which is great. My two complaints are that water pressure in the shower is low and that wifi is hit or miss. I'm trying to get work done but can't get a proper connection at the moment.
We booked this 4 star hotel and arrived at 10:30 am. Despite the 3:00 pm check in, our room was not ready until 4:00. Our room was in the West Wing which was absolutely awful and separate from the other rooms in this hotel. I stayed here a few years ago in a different wing and the rooms were totally different. We were excited that the hotel had an adults only pool. Unfortunately, that pool along with 2 other pools were closed to us for 5 of the 6 days we were there because the hotel hosted special events on them. They played very loud rap music at the pool so napping poolside was not an option. . . We had to pay $168 in resort fees for our 6 night stay. The WiFi worked sporadically & it did not include access to the gym. You had to pay $10 to use it. Do not stay here!
BEWARE!!! MGM housekeeper stole from my room!  I recently stayed at the hotel and had over $2000 in jewelry and cash stolen out of my room.  The only person to access my room other than myself was housekeeping.  Management did not show any concern and to this point has not provided a resolution.  They promised to call me back today and did not.  If you read other reviews, you will see this is not the first time this has happened.  MGM knows a housekeeper stole from my room and has not provided any reimbursement for my losses.
The MGM Grand was a great place to stay.  It was clean with great blackout curtains.  We were on the 5th floor with no view other than the roof.  . . The refrigerator was only for their drinks.  $50 if anything is moved.  We had to keep our drinks warm.  A refrigerator that can be rented is available for $25 a day.  . . The room service food was ok.  My husband liked the sandwich but the Caesar salad was only ok.  . . It is quiet even though it's loud outside.  . . The air conditioner didn't pump out a lot and  needed more power.. . The hotel was smoky but ok in the room.. . I would stay here again.
During my stay in Vegas I stayed 4 nights at the MGM! My experience there was wonderful. From the moment I stepped into that hotel, the hint of vanilla hits my nose and well I was in heaven. They've done a great job of cleaning out the air of any smoke smell.   Front desk was friendly, helpful and quick to check us in. They do need some improvements on their room service....it was alright. I understand for the convenience, room service can be pricey but the food quality wasn't worth it! You're better off going down stairs to get something to munch on.   I must say they do have some great black out curtains, after a night of roaming the casinos and clubs you can sleep -in and not have the sun wake you. There were quite a few pools, good to relax, and Wet Republic where I had a blast. Overall, my stay was great and I will return!
For all the ones who had a bad experience that's to bad:(. I read reviews before we went and got nervous but was quickly relaxed as we checked in!  After a week here and going to every single casino on the strip I was always happy to get back to our casino. MGM. Our room was WONDERFUL exactly what we wanted. Strip view. Amazing staff from the housekeeping, front desk, room service etc. Will only stay here when we go back!!! Thank you MGM and for anyone stressing about it. DO NOT. You will be wasting your time and energy. Best place to stay in Vegas!!!
Since several years Las Vegas is one of our US destinations during the year. We choose always between the TI, Cosmopolitan and MGM.. Booked a room but got a free upgrade after arrival (spa & wellness level). . Very friendly people at the reception. . Beautiful room, enough space for 3 persons.. Cleaning : very well.. Negative remarks :. - Booked a room with 2 beds, but now my son has a sofa to sleep (not so comfortable). - Try to change the mattrass ; for people with back problems the mattrass is too bad . - paying for the use of a refrigerator !?. We love the location. Very handy for our daily trips.. I recommend the hotel and will return.
Expected so much more.. MGM might have been the big boy on the Strip at some point in time, but now it is very much outdated with poor floor/layout design.. . I stayed here a few years ago and it wasn't bad. However, my most recent trip in October 2014 was a huge, huge disappointment. . . I stayed in a Petite King room in the West Wing. There is no better way to describe the room than "petite" and borderline claustrophobic. The room is tiny, poorly lit, and has one window that does not open........  There isn't even a separate door to the bathroom/shower! As soon as you walk in, the bathroom is to the left right next to a shower and sink. The walls are also kinda thin- I could hear my neighbors' bathrooms flush. . . There is also no mini fridge or coffee maker.. I thought these simple "luxuries" were standard nowadays. . . One of the MOST annoying things about the room was its location. The hallways are ridiculously long (and I'm not even trying to sound lazy; they are just LONG. It takes at least 3-4 minutes walking at a decent pace to get down from one end to the elevator). They are also a bit eerie. . . One "good" thing about the West Wing is the cardio room on the 4th floor. It's free and while it's tiny and sauna-like, it is better than nothing considering MGM charges guests $10 to access the actual hotel gym.. . What a disappointment, MGM. Not staying here again. (The Signature Towers, on the other hand, are a complete different story. SO modern and upscale).
I love this place!   It's gets much more traffic than any casino I personally go to!  But it's the SEMA show weekend and holy YUMMA hot guys who know their classic cars!  Plus I've been to pretty much every single club in the last year since it's my first time being single and this is my fav EVER!  They invest a lot to get best DJ's....
Not my favorite hotel on the strip, but also not my least favorite. Come here to get a reasonable price, along with a reasonable room. The customer service is pretty good, they are usually friendly at the front desk. Kinda an older vibe and feel inside, certainly a big difference from going to like Aria or Planet Hollywood.. . This is the only hotel though I get confused walking around through, I can NEVER find my way out. . . MGM grand hosts many events, ranging from UFC fights, to concerts, to award shows. Try to take in at least one even while you are there. The grand arena is huge!. . CSI Crime Scene is fun, kinda small. I noticed my kids had a hard time paying attention - but I had a blast. . . Hakkasan is AMAZING. GO. Seriously. I'm not even going to bother writing anything else about it - GO!. . Check out Wet Republic for a good time - I've seen Tiesto there probably 10 times at least. Amazing. My husband and I sneak away to the pool parties here all the time - probably one of our favorite pools on the strip.
I would do minus five stars if I could. This place provides bad customer service when it comes to getting a room, especially if you are a smoker. They won't hold a smoking room even if you stress it's important. They will however happily send you to a low quality hotel in a downgraded room without a second thought. They won't make up for their failure or even discount the room despite the fact it is not what you requested. We gave up and took the room hoping to somewhat salvage the Halloween spirit. Big mistake! The room was tiny, dirty, and out dated. To top it off, it was all the way at the end of a long hallway, making the hardest way possible to walk to an elevator and go to the casino floor to smoke. The funny part, when we first got to our room, there was a cigarette butt in a glass sitting outside of our room. Seriously?!?!
