Best BurGrs in town. It's a must go when in Vegas. The place is very hip and the entrance has a cool fire display that most people take pictures of.. . The food is amazing, the sweet potatoe fries and the truffle fries are the best you'll ever have. The prices are very average and way worth it.. . A must, must go if you've never been.
Been here twice and they never disappoint!   The chicken burgers and jalapeno poppers are sodelicious.  I would come back again and again next time I'm in Vegas.
We were young and wild, there were three of us. The burger was good the bunn supirior and the onion rings were extravaganza. Waited 15 minutes to get a table,  the service was good but we could get the food a little faster. May god be with Gordon ramsushhh.
"Meh." That was my overall impression of the food. . . Living in Southern California has given me a lot of opportunities to eat gourmet and fast food burgers. I went in expecting Gordon Ramsay's burgers to blow my mind, but I was disappointed. The burgers weren't anything special and I don't see myself craving another one. The burgers we got were about $13-14, which is typical from my experience. Hell's Kitchen Burger was spicier than I thought it would be! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that can't handle moderately spicy food. . . If you want fries, you'll have to order them on the side. The "Just Fries" are plain "fat/thick" fries that'll run you about $7-8. It comes with a spicy curry dip and and house made ketchup. In the house made ketchup you can really taste the brown sugar (yum). Again, the fries were "meh.". . However, the presentation and atmosphere of this restaurant made the dining experience was fabulous.
Had to stop by and get one of Gordon Ramsay's burgers since I was gambling in Planet Hollywood. The restaurant was very clean and it wasn't that busy because it was about 3pm. Since I was by myself I just sat at the bar where I was greeted right away and ordered a drink. From the menu I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium and it was awesome everything was perfect as far as the burger was concerned, everything tasted fresh. I also ordered the Just Fries that came with chipotle and curry ketchup. It was really hard to pick a favorite but I did like the chipotle one better. The one negative thing I will say about my visit was once I ordered my drink it was hard for me to get a refill the bartender basically ignored me. Overall though the price is fair for the burgers only wish I had more time because I would've gone back to try something else and I would recommend this place if u are in town.
I'm a big Gordon fan having eaten at his restaurants here in Vegas and in London. The quality level doesn't change regardless of location. This is hands down the best burgers in Vegas.
May have to wait but I have Seven Stars with Caesars. Get to cut the line and seated with priority. It took me a couple tries before I finally found the right burger for me.
Gordon Ramsey Resturant.. . Yes there was a line to get in, but it moved quickly.. . The staff was friendly and attentive.. . I went fancy when I ordered, American burger and fries. . . Was not able to finish all of it (fries) as there was a lot.  The burger, nothing  survived.  It was excellent.. . Priced a little high but worth the experience.. . Would definitely go back.
I had the Farm burger. Who can resist something that includes duck fat bacon?! It was good, but prepare yourself... The bacon is actually duck. So, while I was dreaming of crunchy bacon dipped in duck fat, what I got was soft, duck fat in bacon-like strips on top of my burger. . . Just Fries were delicious and one order is plenty for two, even three people. . . I topped it off with a chocolate carmel pudding shake. Good, but I like Holstein's shakes better.
This a bit of a let down Mr Ramsey! I Watch Your Show Religiously exspected a lot more. The service was terrible,  I decided to sit at the bar and ordered the lamb burger which set me back 19.00 bucks. I was shocked at the presentation when it arrived,  bland and boring nothing to it. Then the server who was tending to me ignored me during my entire stay. I needed some more ketchup and had to flag down a passing bust boy as I couldn't get the attention of my server.  Like I stated this was a big disappointment especially as I stopped by to eat here just before my flight back to new york.
Nothing special about these burgers. $14 for a cheeseburger.
Onion Rings. Firm, crisp, chefs / cooks KNOW how to batter-up som beautiful onion rings.  Best I've ever had.  Sit at the counter! Mike the bartender turned from what expected as just a meal, nto an experience, & converted me into a fan for life.  & his bar tending partner, Senya, busts it to churn out those drinks - both are masters of their craft.  I Vill Be Bock!
There was a short line to get in but it moves very quick. Once you get inside, the menu has excellent options. The burgers are  fantastic. I never tried the duck bacon before so that was an interesting touch. You will need to purchase french fries separately (and they are awesome) but there will be enough for 2-3 people. Defiantly going to go back.
Yes it's a burger, but yes, you will spend money. That being said, the burgers are pretty good. The jalapeno poppers were great and the service was outstanding. The quality of the ingredients was great, but in the end, it's still a burger. We ordered the chanterelle and Hell's Kitchen burger- chanterelle was better. The truffle fries were a bit dry, but tasted good. They do have a great beer selection(40 on tap) and an amazing cocktail menu. Worth a try for something with Gordon Ramsay's name on it.
The wait for this place was ridiculously long. I had to wait about 45 minutes just to be seated, then I have to wait another 40 minutes for my order. I ordered the Farm Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and sweet potato fries. The house ketchup for the truffle parmesan fries was delicious! The farm burger was good but I expected more flavor. The sweet potato fries and their dipping sauce was great!
I will be dreaming of the food until I come back. . . Yuuum. The line to get in is intimidating. I'm not going to lie. I questioned whether or not we should wait an hour that was quoted to the people in front of us. BUT THERE IS A TRICK. Parties of two are sat VERY quickly. . We waited in line for max 20 minutes. They have tons of two person seating areas and minimal larger group tables. . . Now for the good stuff. Our waiter, Christian was ON IT. He suggested the Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries. Ordered both plus the Yardbird burger. Everything was sensational. . I ate the Yardbird. The chicken was THE GREATEST I have ever had. So soft and easy to bite into. The sauce on the burger was out of control, the bun was perfectly crisp, and everything was just on point. . Truffle fries were AH-MAY-ZING. Real potatoes that were soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. The truffle aioli was so good, I could put that on everything. . We would have had dessert but I was about to burst from fullness. We will be back every time we go to Vegas. . . Paid about $50 for two people. First got there at 9pm. Left at about 11:30pm. Pretty good pricing and meal timing for Vegas.
I hate to do this but this restaurant has gone down hill. We ate here shortly after it opened and it was a great experience. Good drinks, amazing food and awesome staff. This time I honestly felt it was an overpriced burger joint I could eat at back home. To start with service was lacking. Upon sitting we weren't given a drink menu or any spiel about speciality drinks. My water glass was consistently empty and our server never came to check on us because he was watching the football game in the corner. Our jalapeno poppers were cold in the center! The only redeeming factor was my burger was cooked to perfection and the truffle parmesan fries were excellent. Upon receiving the bill I felt spending $30 more for the Aria buffet would have been a better choice.
OK as big Burger fan, I have tried so many burger places.. As of the moment i tried Gordon Ramsay's Burger, i am sure now this is the best i have ever tried in my life.. . When you have a chance to try this place don't be cheap and think about the money, you will have to try the delicious fresh burgers, with the Parmesan Truffle Fries that is much better than any other place i have tried it at (good size for sharing). At the end the Sticky toffee pudding pops is a must because you will never have something like this or close to it anywhere else.. Try these three and then you will know what i am talking about.
Best burger I've ever had and best burgers on the strip! I'm very picky with my burgers but these are perfection! Everyone in my party of 8 were very happy with theirmeal. I loved it so much that I almost went there a second time during my trip to Vegas. I recommend getting the truffle parmesan fries with your burger..so good! I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready. In the mean time, you could walk around the miracle mile shops which are right next door or gamble a bit. The food is definitely work the wait!
For something different sit at the counter. Not the bar, the COUNTER. IT'S A WELL OILED MACHINE!. . Here on a busy Saturday afternoon it was fun to see how professional and fast the staff was. Zigging and zagging... as if Gordon himself trained them,.. and yes, the Burgers are great!
Both the experience and food could have been better.. . Arrived a little past 9pm on a Friday. I was already expecting to wait so I wasn't too surprised when the host told us it would be about an hour. (I spent that hour on the slot machines. Shh..) Anyway, to get put on the list, you go straight to the host. Don't wait in that line, because that's for something else. We waited in that line for a little bit and was wondering why it wasn't moving or why nobody was coming up to get our information. There's a sign that says to do so but a lot of people could miss it if there's a long line.. . They texted us to come back to the restaurant, because our table was being prepared. We quickly ordered and received our food in a reasonable amount of time. They got our appetizers wrong, but they were happy to correct their mistake. We ordered regular fries and sweet potato fries. They were a little cold and the sauces weren't anything special. My party ordered the burgers and they were pretty good. Nothing memorable but not horrible either. I made the mistake of ordering the fish sandwich and it was not good at all. It was very greasy and leaves a disgusting taste in your mouth. After eating 1/3/ of my sandwich, I called it quits. I ended up letting my party try my sandwich in attempt to not waste as much food as possible. They weren't too happy either. After my attempt with the fish sandwich and sharing it with my party, 1/3 was still left. Boo.. . I'm glad I was able to try this place, but I don't think I'll be back. For me, it's a little overrated. Long wait for mediocre food. It's worth going to at least once though.
Jalapeno poppers are out of this world. Never thought of adding bacon but I guess that's why Gordon Ramsey is an acclaimed famous chef and I am just someone eating at one of his places. I had the Uber Cheeseburger and my husband got the Farm Burger. Duck Bacon on a burger?!?!  Oh yeah !  These were the juiciest most flavorful burgers ever and I feel like I can never eat another burger again now. It was almost a spiritual experience. To top it off we split Parmesan Truffle Fries. Tasty!  I'm going to dream about this meal again tonight. Thank you Gordon Ramsey, thank you for Burgr.
Epic! Barn burger with sweet potato fries cannot be missed! Need largerwine/beer list.
Customer service from our waiter was amazing, texting when your table is ready, awesome. Food, Delicious.. . We ordered the jalapeno popper shooters, and everyone had one of them. The sauce they were in and the jalapeno popper were amazing. Presentation was cool as well. Would definitely recommend getting these again.. . The milkshake we got, had like a super thick rich chocolate pudding on top? It was delicious.. . Also, the burger was super juicy and delicious. The waiter told us all the burger meat was soaked in butter prior to cooking, and that no matter what cook you get on your burger it would be moist. It definitely was. I had problems figuring out what I wanted, and he definitely had recommendations depending on mood.
Came here on a Saturday night for two and had a great experience.  My date and I waited for 30 minutes before being seated (not too shabby), and were served almost instantly.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my dated ordered the Farm Fresh Burger.  We also ordered Truffle fries.. . Overview. Hell's Kitchen Burger- amazingly delicious, the right amount of spiciness, and comes with an egg.. . Farm Fresh Burger- only had one bite, but seemed a little heavy.  Didn't have any vegetables. . Truffle fries- delicious, but I think overhyped.  They were $11 and seemed like typical french fries only with truffle seasoning on top.  I guess it would be good if you like truffle fries. . Service and experience were amazing.  We ended up watching a UCLA football game on the screen and finishing in under an hour.  Quick, friendly, somewhat affordable. 4/5
Arrived around 8 and had to wait in line for 20 minutes which was odd because there were plenty of open tables. Not sure if they were understaffed or what the deal was. . . Food was awesome though! The Farm Burger is the best burger I've ever had! It's got a quail egg and duck bacon on top which makes for a delicious combination. The truffle fries were pretty good, not the best I've ever had. . . I'd say the service was above average and the staff was friendly and knowledgable. . . Highly recommend anyone else to try it out while in Vegas especially if you're looking for a good burger.
Another one of those things that I had to do because the wife loves Gordon Ramsay, and I'm not paying for the family to go to his steakhouse.  Anyway, about 15 people in line ahead of us for a late lunch, and the hostess said about 25 minutes.  Ugh - but it was only about 15 minutes.  Nice.  The menu is online so you know it's expensive.  About $12-16 for a burger.  Ordered burger and fries for everybody, but the waitress said most people end up sharing one order   - and she was right.  If you have a larger party, I recommend ordering all 3 fries - sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and plain fries and sharing, as each comes with its own delicious dipping sauces (honey jalapeno mayo and truffle aioli being my favorites.)  You can order the meat any way, meaning if you want a rare burger, they'll cook it.  It's a pretty casual place, located at the front of Planet Hollywood, so you don't have to walk through the casino if you're entering from the strip.  Hell's Kitchenburger had a nice kick to it, and I liked it better than the wife's Euro Burger (she loved hers though).  Service was good and if you watch any of GR's shows, you know you're pretty much guaranteed quality food and service.  Spent $105 before tax for 4 burgers, 3 fries, and 5 non-alcoholic drinks.
Unimpressed. . . Was quite excited to eat here because of the celebrity chef thing going on. . . Service was prompt. Place was quite busy because of course it's in the center of the vegas strip in a busy mall. Drink menu was presented on an iPad which is becoming the new thing at most metropolitan and touristy places. . . Got the Hell's Kitchen burger. I'm usually not a fan of jalapenos and avocado in my burger but I got it anyway because well I wanted to try the "official" burger. Regardless of my preferences for burger additives the beef was not really seasoned well. It was cooked good and the bun was good but the lack of seasoning made the entire experience bland. . . The fries did not taste fresh. Despite dipping them in the accompanying sauces I couldn't really get myself to like them. Very dry.. . The strawberry milkshake was good but it was just like any other good milkshake. Nothing to go crazy about. . . Mediocre food. Extra charge for fries. Not really feeling it. . . My waitress was super hot though. And nice. So that's a plus. And hot. Pleasant too. Did I mention she was hot?
Just regular tasting burger but way too overpriced!  Long wait and it's not worth it.
Farmburger.  That's all I need to say.  I ordered that with a side of their truffle fries and my meal kept me satisfied all night.  That said, it's a good meal to have before you go out and drink!  I was on a good buzz all night.  I wasn't too full, and it didn't leave me feeling hungry too early in the night.. . For a big party, the staff was very accommodating and everything seemed to go smoothly.  There were a dozen of us out for a birthday but we got a table at a decent time.  I love that we can check in and get notified as to when to come back for our reservations.  It keeps us from having to wait in line and waste time in Vegas!!  I'd definitely go back.  The Ramsay restaurant is better than one I've gone to in LA.  The burger was worth the wait!
Good for the price. . Farm burger: bun very good, meat itself could have used more seasoning, fried egg could've been less cooked. Overall burger a bit dry.. Parmesan truffle fries: needed to be cooked more (needs more crisp!) overall taste really good! Especially with the garlic aioli. Best garlic aioli I've tasted!. . Hubby got the Hell's Kitchen. Delish and just the right amount of spice!
I had the Euro Burger, fantastic! Best burger I've had in a long time.  You could taste every element of the burger. The fries were not my favorite,  although real potatoes, they were very dry.
The onion rings were amazing.  The French fries and fish sandwich are good.  There was a wait but not to long for a party of two.
im vouching for an 8 man bachelor party. Best burger in town. Hands down. And Damn good coffee. Best part was our service. Our waitress,  Hillary, was one of our trip highlights. best service we recieved all weekend. Glasses full and kept us smiling. I would highly recommend anyone dinning at ramsey burgerto request hillary as your server. You will have a blast! Thanks Hillary!!
The food and drinks are delicious. I personally would recommend getting the popcorn as an appetizer . It was made to perfection!
The burgers at this joint is very good but I would say bachi burger is alittle better.  The meat is very juicy and cook to perfection.  Gordon Ramsey sure know how to make a very good burger.
With over 2000 reviews and a 4-star rating, my review will do little to impact the average. I'll still put in my two cents:. . After finishing the meal, my thought was that those giving Burgr 4* don't get around much. Maybe they live in a city with lousy food and this really mediocre burger is "the best ever".. . My first reaction to the menu was that I may come back. There are a lot of fun items on it in addition to the burgers. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and the Aioli / Parmesan fries. This was on the strong recommendation of the server (and many reviews here). In the end: Ho-Hum cheese, ho-hum duck bacon, a fried egg that was over done ( the yolk should be runny and become like a sauce to the burger; it was fully cooked). Worse yet, my Medium-Rare burger came medium-well. I wanted to yell out "You Donkey! You overcooked the #@$%@ Burger". I dealt with it as unless something egregiously bad I don't like to send it back as I know it goes straight to the bin. The parmesan fries are large rectangular cut. The aioli was good, but that's hard to mess up. The fries were a bit chewy. Not crisp outside, soft inside as they should be. I get way better fries from fry trucks at home.. . I don't get the four stars. Even if the meat was done right, it would not have been great.
I really want to give BurGR 4.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me.  We visited in a group of 10 this past Friday night around 9pm, with no reservation.  I love restaurants, including BurGR, that will put your name on the list and text you when your table is ready, so you can roam around instead of hovering by the entrance.  We were quoted an hour and a half, but the wait only ended up being about 15 minutes.  Either way, we would have been fine because the lobby opens up into the Planet Hollywood casino, so we would have had no trouble entertaining ourselves.. . I am generally suspicious of celebrity chef-owned restaurants, because it seems that once they get a tv show, the chefs are not very involved in their restaurants.  Honestly, I would not have chosen BurGR had we not been traveling with a large group.  But I could not have been more pleasantly surprised with the quality of the experience.  Service, food and drinks were excellent and the prices are incredibly modest for a resort on the Strip.  $7 for a craft beer and $14 for a gourmet burger is in line with what we pay at good burger places at home.  . . My boyfriend and I usually eat at independently owned restaurants, avoiding chains and touristy joints, and we were both very happy with our meal here.  I had a delicious jalapeno tequila cocktail and the Brittania burger.  He had an off-menu pork burger and a draft beer.  We split the truffle parmesan fries and one of the milkshakes.  My only criticism is that the truffle fries were not as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was still great.  . . There is a lot of mediocre, overpriced food on the Las Vegas Strip, but BurGR was our best meal on the Strip in 3 days.  If I'm ever in town again, I'll be back!
Sorry Chef Ramsay but please don't bloody yell at me but your gourmet burgers are overrated.  Wouldn't pay the price for the burger even it was half the price.  Didn't have enough flavor and the juiciness of a great burger to satisfy my appetite.
Last day in Vegas. Staying at the Flamingo, and hubby had a hankerin' for a burger. We asked a server at the pool, and she recommended BurGR. A nice short walk to Planet Hollywood, and BurGR was right at the entry near Cabo Wabo Cantina. Walked right in and was seated right away. . . Husband ordered the American, I ordered the Hot and Spicy, which had tomato, jalapenos, and avocado, with a sesame seed bun. It was absolutely delicious. The flavor was so bold, the burger so juicy, the cheese and avocado, so nicely paired. We shared the original fries, with a side of avocado ranch for dipping. We ate every last bite!! The service was prompt, the lighting was a little dark, and I felt like we were sitting a little close to our neighbors, but I understand being in a casino hotel, that's the way it is. Nice beer selection, which was presented on an IPad. Interesting way to display the drink menu, but it was fine by me. The meal was affordable, about $55 for 2 burgers, 2 tall drafts, and a fry. . . This was the best meal I had in 3 days in Vegas. If you want a delicious burger, and aren't turned off by celebrity owned restaurants, check this place out!  YUM
This burger was literally the best burger I have had in my life. Granted, I don't eat them all of the time, but if they all tasted like this, you bet I would! The onion rings were delicious. The fries were lacking, both in taste and in texture. They were much too soft for my liking. My companion got the hot dog (I know!) and said it was ok, but kept nabbing bites of my burger!. The drinks were spot on. I had no room for dessert after gorging myself on so much food. I would definitely return, but leave off the fries this time!
Awesome awesome burgers. I'm not much of a burger person, but I really liked this place.  We had the truffle fries, the farm burger, and the chili dog. . . I had read that the chili dog as noteworthy here, so even though I would ordinarily never get it, I gave it a shot. It was good, but there was nothing memorable about it other than the size.. . The farm burger was just excellent. It was very well thought out and balanced. The meat was cooked perfectly. There is not much to say other than it was perfection.. The truffle fries were savory and delicious and the portion size was healthy.. Skip the buffets and stop in to GR BurGR for a bite. You will be glad you did.. PS - I loved the uniforms here!
Ate here last night, and it was fantastic!. Service was awesome, we sat at the kitchen bar area and got to see Christina, winner of Hell's Kitchen season 10! She talked to us and was really down to earth.. Great experience!
Amazing burgers...farm burger is perfection and they bake all the bread fresh daily....a great meal from start to finish...fries and onion rings and the dipping sauces were so yummy...not greasy and heavy like some fried foods...cutomer service is key and our waiter was the sweetest...explained everything and gave great recommendations. He let me keep the menu as a souvenir! And finally...the creme brulee milkshake...brilliant!...definitely in my top three favorite burger places in Vegas.
Excellent food. The chicken burger was amazing and onion rings some of the best I've ever had. The service was some of the best I've had in this town. Plus they carry my favorite beer innis&gunn. Only thing I didn't care for was the wait to get a tabke and the katchup they used. There's just somethings I like simple and standard. But I do recommend this restaurant and I will return
Best burger ever thanks Gordon! We split the black and bleu burger it was amazing. So juicy and flavorful seriously we might go back again today. Also split an order of truffle fries I loved both the aioli and chipotle ketchup.  And we got the Oreo shake with Creme brulee pudding. Totally worth the calories!
I had the farm burger and my wife had the American burger and truffle fries. Neither of us cared for the fries and the burgers were just ok. We actually preferred FatBurger, maybe cuz we just like normal burgers. Service was very good though.
Yes yes yes!!!. . Burgers are delicious, as are the onion rings and truffle fries. Great dipping sauces too. . . They have a mushroom burger for vegetarians (I tried my friends, wasn't a fan) but I really don't understand the vegetarian thing. . . Would recommend over and over.
Thanks to my Bestie who was dying to this place out we chose to make this our Grand Finale. Now I'm your average In-N-Out loving girl who lives on the East Coast so I try to slide pass there when town but this time i held off for this place instead. From the Burgers, to the beer, on to the truffle fries, right on down to the onion rings everything was beyond finger licking good. Paul was as helpful as a server could get with recommendations and it led to everyone at our table being full and happy. BurGR is one of my new favorite Vegas spots and beyond met my expectations.
I ordered the regular burger and thought it was just Okay. The fries were the frozen variety and they only had truffle ketchup which I dislike. Iced tea was $4. . . My wife had the "Hell's Kitchen Burger"  and really liked it. That saved it from getting a 2 star rating from me. I have absolutely no desire to revisit.
Food Porn:. . Ordered the American burger, shake #1 (chocolate pudding with 6 inches of caramel and a toffee cookie) and the truffle fries. . . Shake was a sin, burger was cooked to the right temperature and very high quality meat -- with a Kobe-like texture. Truffle fries could have been done a little longer but generous cheese and truffle oil. . . Staff was friendly except for one aloof girl at the front. . . Get there 20 minutes before opening for lunch or wait for 20 minutes in line.
Definitely the best burger I've had for a very very very long time. I had the one with the mushrooms and it was amazing. Cooked to perfection. The seasoning and the combination of ingredients had my mouth watering for every bite. I had a side order of the onion rings which was good as well, but it definitely took back seat to the burger. . . I got there at about 11am on a Saturday. There was already a line, but since it was just me, I found a spot at the bar immediately. Highly recommended for anyone looking for one of the best burgers they'll have for a while.
Normally you wouldn't catch me at a gourmet burger joint, but  thought to give this place a try with all the good reviews. To start things off there was a pretty long line in front of the fire display they had. But for this line it was only for those with a party of two. For any parties over two they would have to give them there number and they would receive a text for whenever their table was ready. . . We probably waited 30 min in line which isn't that bad I guess. For those that had parties of more than 3 it was approximately 2-3 hour wait.  So we get to our table and the choices that they had wasn't too much, but to me that's a good thing. We ended up getting the Parmesan fries which were actually really good and the sauces that they came with complimented it really nicely. . . For the main course I chose to get the farm burger which had duck bacon and egg. Overall it was definitely a good choice. The only thing that I would recommend for this place is to actually have "normal" ketchup. I know that gourmet burger places aren't high on having just regular ketchup but it wouldn't have been nice to have. Instead they had this somewhat chipotle ketchup which wasn't bad though. . . So yeah, good place if you're looking for a highclass burger place in Vegas. Definitely would go here again.
We ate here today for lunch with high expectations from the four star yelp rating. This restaurant missed the mark on food and focused too much on the Vegas decor.  . . We ordered the Hell's Kitchen,  Classic American burger, and Parmesan truffled fries. The fries were served cold and looked like potato wedges. We had to ask the server for a fresh batch but the second serving wasn't much better, lacking the truffle flavor. . . We asked the waiter what type of beef was being served but he couldn't answer. . . The burgers were mediocre at best. It lacked some sort of sauce..... Maybe aioli. . . Overall I wouldn't recommend waiting in line and dinning here. I'm disappointed in the food and lack of flavors given all the Ramsay hype. Check out Umami at the SLS instead. They serve organic high quality beef for the same price point and taste 1000 times better.
I was underwhelmed by Burgr. We ordered the 5-Spice Chicken Sliders, the Parmesan truffle fries and the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The wait for our food seemed excessive and the tables are packed together pretty tightly. If you're looking to have a conversation, this is not your place. The burger was rare, although we ordered medium, and was under seasoned, but the toppings of roasted jalapeno and roasted tomato helped punch up the flavor. The sliders were missing the pickled scallions but were crispy and the brioche buns stood up well. They just needed some bite - was expecting that with the Sriracha mayo but there just wasn't enough on the bun to provide that extra heat we were expecting. The highlights for us were the fries...really tasty served with aioli and fresh ketchup...and, the server was attentive without being intrusive. Best of all, when you receive your bill, there is an automated survey so that you're able to provide instant feedback.
I have eaten at several good 'gourmet' burger places on the strip, and BurGR has been my least favorite so far (see my "Vegas" list for other burger recommendations on the strip: http://www.yelp.com/list/vegas-las-vegas-196).  It is by far the largest, and was mostly filled, but it's the least aesthetically pleasing from the inside.  Sure there is an awesome looking sign lined with flames, but the seating and arrangement of the restaurant reminded me of a hospital cafeteria.  The staff were also wearing outfits that appeared to be '50/'60s inspired that many of them looked extremely uncomfortable in.  Almost every time a female staff member walked by she would be tugging on her dress because of the awkward fit.  Not to mention that almost no one looked happy to be working here.  The atmosphere was in stark contrast to all of the other burger places I have been to on the strip.  It felt like a very cold and robotic environment that lacked personality beneath the flames that initially drew us in.. . The food was decent, but not to the standards of the other burger places I have had on the strip.  I ordered the Southern Yardbird Burger, which is a chicken sandwich, and a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The sandwich was okay, but nothing extraordinary.  The fries were nowhere near as good as the parmesan fries I had at a sports book the day before.  I also took a couple bites out of the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which I believe is their signature sandwich, and neither me nor my date thought too highly of it. Overall, the food here was nothing special.. . I can't see myself eating at BurGR again.  It is okay, but not up to par with the other offerings on the strip.  There are many other places in the immediate vicinity that I much rather eat at.
This review is more about the experience with the executive chef than the food at Booger restaurant.. . So we were at Burgr restaurant and had just ordered a $ 15 burger when I noticed that Christine from Hell's Kitchen was standing around talking to two of her friends. I didn't want to interrupt so I waited 10 minutes before one of her friends left. That's when I decided to ask her if she could take a picture with us. I gave my camera to a waitress and politely began to request, "I am sorry to interrupt..." Even before I can get the next words out, she RUDELY said twice while raising her finger, "Oh, but you are interrupting!" Never have i been so disgusted/appalled at one's behavior toward another polite human, especially after waiting so patiently.  . . The nerve of this person. She is merely a reality star and she thinks that she is a hot celebrity. I am not sure if even most real celebrities would behave in such a rude manner. It must be because she knows that her food SUCKS and that her gig will be over soon and her 5 seconds of fame will be up.. . Mr. Ramsey, you made a big mistake in selecting Christine as your winner and executive chef. . . Also, the food was bland and the meat was overcooked, so i would not recommend going to a place where the executive chef is rude and the place is overpriced!
The Hell'sKitchen burger was yummy and kind of spicy. The onion rings are so good, so far the best onion rings I ever had. The just fries are like whatever, it's ok. I had a great time and I definitely recommend it to any one to try. The service was quick and hardly any waiting. I went on a Friday afternoon.
Wait was about an hour long for a group of people. Hostess- main girl with the tattoos was impatient, the other girls were nice. All the waiters were big buff guys- for you single ladies or in my case for my old lady . I got the hells kitchen burger- it was good. got fries- it was good. jalapenos poppers were also good. . 2 people be around $40 bucks for burgers. . design as cool with the fire and stuff
Since this was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, I had very high expectations for the place.....and they were met. Every burger on the menu sounded delicious so it was hard to pick! I ended up ordering the Farm Burger: Meat topped with fried egg, duck breast bacon, and English sharp cheddar cheese. It was delicious! . . I can't wait to come back and try something new!
We are staying near BurGR and dropped in for a quick hot dog.  FABULOUS!!!  Probably the BEST ever!!!  Onion rings are really good too.  Love the atmosphere.
This place is to die for! We found this place cause we stayed at Plant Hollywood cause of the fire display. It's a pretty pricey place if you want a quick bite but what restaurant on the strip is? I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle fries. The burger had the perfect kick because of the jalapenos! The meat was paired perfectly with the cheese. I can't recall the name of the cheese. However, it wasn't your normal average cheese. The truffle fries was amazing, they give you two different sauces. One was a spicier ketchup and the other was a creamy thick ranch. The service here was great. Our waiter was super friendly. She engaged in a conversation and gave us full attention. Usually I have to flag the waiter down. The seating is limited so don't come during rush hours.  Overall, I would defiantly recommend this place and for sure coming back for another bite!
Expected to be blown away.  I was satisfied, but ultimately underwhelmed.  The food tasted like a decent burger at any respectable restaurant.  The fries were pretty good.  Nice atmosphere.
This was my birthday dinner, and it was AMAZING. I got the uber cheeseburger, my boyfriend got the truffle burger and they were both so delicious it was ridiculous. Though I do have to say I think the truffle burger was better. . . Also, if you like sweet potato fries, they are a MUST here. They come with a powdered sugar shaker and jalapeno mayo. They will haunt your dreams forever.
We just got into town and checked into the hotel and was starving.  This was in our hotel at the Planet Hollywood, and who hasnt heard of gordon ramsey.  So, i had to try.  The Wall entrance is definitely a great backdrop for pictures.  It set the mood on what we were about to enjoy. . Food is phenomenal.  Different types of gourmet burgers.  I feel the bun is a crucial part of the burger.  It was so soft and buttery that just enhance the flavor.  . . I definitely will be coming back again.
Extremely long waits without a reservation.. Had a vegeterian burger (don't quite remb the name) but it was definitely not worth the wait and the price!
Most overrated restaurant in las vegas next to all the bobby flay bs. Hired model wannabe staff who are rude and stuck up. Service sucked but what would you expect from entitled wannabes. The food is a joke of different food channel concoctions and is at best a burger joint staffed with hotties.  Only foodie wannabes and has beens rate this high.  Most people say its great because of all the hype, the tv exposure, and to make themselves feel good about the dragged out long waits they had to endure for mediocrity and the painfully outrageous prices. In reality, they know it sucked and their wallets got sucked dry even worse for it.  We all know gordan ramsay is a complete jerk and a hole to people on tv. This place will close down in less than three years. There are WAY better out there at normal prices.. . For people to say this is the best burger they had in their life is a laugh as they will later realize in life they got suckered into all this gordan ramsay hype.
It was fine. The wait was about 30 minutes for the 2 of us. I was surprised the burger toppings weren't more interesting and exciting. Tourists want accessible, I guess. The burger was decent. I have had better. A lot of bun. $13, then another 8 for fries. The "push-up" dessert was amazing. The service was good. The tables are packed in, so you don't have much privacy. The beer list was fairly good. The design of the logo, fire wall, and menu were clever. The curry ketchup was the highlight for me.
If this was a review of the food only it would be a 5 star review. The food is terrific and well worth a trip to BurGR.. . Unfortunately the service while seated alone at the bar left something to be desired. This might not be an issue if you arrive and are seated at a table or come in a bigger party, but the length of time from sitting down to being approached for a drink order and the time from finishing my food/beverage to receiving a check was more than I've experienced anywhere else in Las Vegas.. . The time from putting my order in until the food arrived was very reasonable, and the restaurant was busy. The view you get of the kitchen from the bar was terrific as well.. . Next time I'm in Vegas I'll just call ahead and see if I can't place an order for pickup.
It takes allot for me to give out Five Stars, but Gordon Ramsay you have won me over.   We were in Vegas a few weeks back and were all craving a Gordon Ramsay Burger.   I generally don't go into these celebrity chef establishments with high hopes, as unfortunately they let you down more than they live up the expectations.  GR BurGR did not disappoint though.  First off the hostess takes your number and sends you a text message once your table is ready, which allows you to go have fun in the casino while you wait.  I absolutely love this idea, I highly recommend other busy restaurants follow this lead.   I recently had my Gall Bladder out, so I couldn't partake in the fried food digestion with my friends but they loved the French Fries and thought the Jalapeno appetizer where you get a single random extremely hot one mixed in with the regular poppers was a brilliant idea.  They all got different burgers off the menu and raved about them, I stuck with the Turkey Burger and was extremely happy. It was moist, flavorful and plenty filling.    What goes best with a Burger? The answer is obviously beer and this place has a great selection on draft.   For everyone going to Vegas I can't recommend anything higher, you must check out Gordon Ramsay BurGr.
I had the Euro burger with Sweet Potato Fries and a Oreo Shake. The burger was amazing, the fries were great, and the Oreo shake, although way to thick and filling was spectacular. Service was excellent and very knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend and will go back.
I cannot believe anyone would ever give this place a positive review.  The service was absolutely terrible!  Promised no more than a 45 minute wait time and at 45 minutes were told that we had another 45 minutes?  . . Finally sat and ordered our burgers.  They were dry and flavorless...  The only thing saving this from a zero rating were the truffle fries....  Outstanding for sure...  . . Do yourself a favor - there are plenty of other burger places far superior...
Just had the most expensive burger I've ever eaten.   And it was worth every penny. Got the Euro-burger.  Nothing short of spectacular.   . . It's crowded loud and friendly.  Beer selection is typical Vegas pedestrian.  Truffle fries are everywhere these days.  . . And the Burger- amazing.   . . Hate to say it - worth going to
Yum! My burger was DELISH! Cooked perfectly, the perfect amount of ingredients (not so big that it was impossible to bite) and AMAZING sweet potato fries topped with powdered sugar (don't knock it till you try it). Also, the jalapeno poppers are out of this world good!. . So glad we got to try this place out in Vegas, it's definitely worth a visit. . . My four star rating is because our waitress seemed less than thrilled to be serving us and was not the most accomdating when we asked for a recomendation. Also, I can't stand when you have to order fries on the side, especially when your burger alone is $15. But hey, it's Vegas...
The burgers and the customer service are amazing. If you like spicy foods, the Hell's Kitchen Burger is delicious! The only "issue" was when I bit into a seed but it was too good. My boyfriend (basic ass B when it comes to food) ordered the Farm's Burger, which came with duck bacon and an over easy egg, and he loved it. Our cousin ordered the Blue Cheese Burger and he enjoyed it as well. . . For my Hell's Kitchen Burger, I accompanied it with the GL Innis and Gunn beer, which was a great compliment. The Oreo Shake is also delicious. . . Our waiter checked on us several times and was willing to work with us if we didn't like anything. Burgers were roughly $10-$15, drinks are $7-$10, and appetizers are $10. For 3 people, drinks, appetizer, and drinks, we spent $78 total. . . If you're in Vegas, stop by here if you want a good and affordable meal.
Yes, Mr. Ramsay, you've hit the spot.. . It is very difficult for me to finish my whole meal at times. Especially, when the burgers are bigger than my face. However, I had absolutely no problem finishing my Southern Yardbird Burger. I ate and I ate and I ate and I finished. I don't think I looked up once to check of my friends were still at the table. . . Also, the fries there are a must! HOW CAN YOU HAVE A BURGER WITHOUT FRIES!?!?. . The restaurant was reasonably priced. I took $50 for my meal just in case and I only spent $20 including tip. Not bad at all.
this was my forth time coming to this restaurant and things have changed (for the worst).. . the burger which was the stable of this establishment was a dried out tiny perfectly formed and pressed portion of meat. now  being a burger aficionado, i swear was frozen! a sentiment of my entire group that ordered the burger or burgr. as gordon likes to call them..  . also the hot dog was rabid.the party that made the mistake of eating it was sick as a dog that eve and could not make it to dinner later that evening. . . the only thing worse than the food was the service which was non-existent. we actually had to run up to the bar to order our drinks.. . i'm thinking of starting a reality show where i review various  bad eateries and was going to start here.  a penny for you thoughts (just not one of these burgers), yes?
I had the Southern Yardbird chicken sandwich. My husband had the other chicken spicy sandwich. We both loved it. More importantly, we had the truffle Parmesan fries. So very good. The beer selection was great.  Bartenders were awesome (we sat at the bar watched a college football game on a huge tv that they changed the channel just for us). And try the Skinny Screw. It was an amazing cocktail... Tangerine, hint of mint. Wonderful overall experience. :).
Food was really good. My wife and I shared Southern Yard Bird burger which was awesome. We shared Truffle fries and Jalapeno poppers which are served in a shot glass of dipping sauce, loved them both. Service was so bad after we sat down, during service and trying to get the bill. The waiter and waitress were obviously LV Public School dropouts.
What a great place to visit and cost wasn't near what I thought it to be,
Food was great and the blood orange martinis are soooo good. We went on a Sunday night and only had to wait like 20 min. And there were 4 of us. We took our kids with us and they enjoyed the wings and a burger.
This review will reflect our recent visit on 10/21/14 as well as one other visit about a year prior.. . Having been to a few of Gordon's restaurants (Maze in NYC, BurGR in Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas) one thing I notice every time is the consistency of both service and quality.  There has never been a hiccup.  You can tell that he demands a certain level of service and thankfully it is carried out 100% of the time.. . BurGR is set in a casual location near the front of Planet Hollywood casino, just off of the strip.  The decor is cool and hip, with an open plan...big TVs surrounding the dining room, and a clear view from all seats back to the kitchen.. . The service, as mentioned, is top notch.  You are greeted warmly by everyone you encounter, and even though this is a "burger joint" kind of feel, the staff is on a 5 star restaurant level.. . The food is as awesome as you anticipate.  We've had a few different burgers here...the Hell's Kitchen (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avacado, oven roasted tomato)...the American (american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion)...and the Chanterelle (chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam)...as well as the truffle parmesan fries (hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli).  My favorite is probably the Hell's Kitchen, but you know you're eating an incredible burger when you get a simple American style and it tastes amazing.  Everything was cooked to perfection (medium...even though the chef recommends medium rare) and the buns are as tasty as you can get.. . For desert, we've had the sticky pudding pops twice.  This is a tough one to review.  If you haven't had his normal sticky toffee pudding, you'll love these pops!!  They are fun, delicious and a cool twist on a classic.  However, if you've had his REAL sticky toffee pudding (with that salted caramel ice cream that comes in the shape of a butter stick) you might be a bit disappointed!  But hey..his original sticky toffee pudding is the BEST dessert you can get, period. (Seriously..it's worth a trip to the bar at Gordon Ramsay Steak just to order it). . Anyway, Gordon delivers the goods here at BurGR.  The prices are in line with the food quality (burgers are in the 13-15 range) and the experience is top notch.  You simply cannot go wrong.
We decided to come in for lunch after a friend referred us after dining there. There is a line on the side and we were informed that it was meant for parties of 2 or 1's, but there are times that they put larger parties in there depending on how busy they are. So they recommended if we came back as a larger party to have one person stand in line and the other check in at the front so we don't lose our spot. . We were immediately greeted by a tall blonde who was friendly and walked us to our table. She recommended the Euro burger and the Hell's kitchen burger. The other hostess seemed like we were beneath them, but this one was nice to us. . Our server Alex was AMAZING! He made us feel like we were friends from elementary school. He sold my fiance on the Farm burger (fried egg, duck breast bacon) and he loved it. I stuck with the Euro (goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomato) and it was amazing. The flavor of both of them was great. Alex was great with everything and every recommendation from the beer to dessert was great. He 'wine and dined' us and he made the experience even better. Thank you for such an amazing time, we will be back and requesting him.
When the coasters, menus and sign out front all have Gordon Ramsey's name on them, the is set quite high right from the start. . . I had the American Burger from BURGR and it was outstanding! My drink was the number 1 Shake which was chocolate with caramel pudding and whipped crime. AMAZEBALLS! The service was exceptional. BURGR lost a star because the French fries were below sub-par. I've had better fries at Mickey D's.
A casual burger place located right at the entrance of Planet Hollywood.  . . Euro Burger - $16 - above average 3.5/5.. Truffle Aioli, goat cheese, tomato.  The Euro Burger was good.  Bread had nice texture and the meat had a nice smoky taste.  My only gripe is the burger was kind of small.  For $16 I was hoping it'd be bigger.  The burger doesn't come w/ a side either.. . Fries - average.  The serving size is quite large.  1 order probably fees 3-4 people.. . PROS:. -Burgers are decent.  The beef burgers a nice smoky taste to then.. -Decent selection of beers on tap, 15-20 beers.. . CONS:. -Burgers don't come w/ fries. -Burgers are kind of small.. . TIPS:. -Long line if you don't come early.   We finished dinner early, sometime around 6:30.  Around this time there was a huge line outside.
Best burgers on the strip.. . Located inside planet hollywood. The wait now (fall 2014) isnt as long as the wait when it first opened up, so don't be afraid to come by and check it out guys! I know as a yelper, reading about waits really deter me from going to a place, but it honestly isnt bad nowadays. I went during prime time  friday evening  for dinner and wait was about 20 minutes give or take.. . FARM BURGER - get it. its to die for. the burger meat is amazing and juicy. They do it just the way you want it. its SO GOOD. I always have to cut mine in half and eat it in halves because its so big. . . TRUFFLE FRIES - SO YUMS. they also bring out this amazing ketchup and some type of BOMB aioli sauce. listen to all the other yelpers on here and order the truffle fries.. . I've been here several times and I always order the same thing, so I don't have any other opinions on the menu items, hahaha. I'm a creature of habit ,what can i say. However, the interior is nice and roomy, and I love the fire that they have displayed in the front of the restaurant. If you're looking for great burgers at a great cost, come here!. . TIP: DO NOT FORGET YOUR TOTAL REWARDS PLAYERS CARD. it saves you money on every item on the menu.
Cool and casual burger joint but at 5 star restaurant level. Stopped by onour way home from Utah to Cali and of course, being a big fan of Gordon Ramsey, I had to come here and try it. There was a long line but for some reason, my party of 7 were seated in about 5 minutes. Our server, Mike went above and beyond to make sure everything went well and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us great suggestions. Everything we had from the Honey Glazed Pig Bao Buns to the Chanterelle Burger to the Truffle Fries were nothing short of perfect. Definitely a place that everyone has to try when they're in Vegas.
The best meal we had in Vegas!!!  All four of us had different burgers and we all loved them!  Got the onion rings and poppers as appetizers and they were great as well. Our waitress Lauren was incredible. She was very knowledgable about everything in the menu and was an overall delight to deal with. I hope all of the servers deal with customers the way she treated us!  Great place, can't wait to go back!!!
This place is decent enough for what it is.  I can't give it 5 stars because the burger didn't blow me away and I can't give it 4 because it was overcooked for how I ordered it. I ordered medium-well and it arrived well done with no pink inside.  . . I went around 12 noon on a Monday and there was no wait at all to get a table.  The burger took about 20 minutes to come out after I ordered it.  The hostesses and waitstaff were very nice.  . . I ate the Hell's Kitchen burger which is asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and and oven roasted tomato.  I liked this combination of ingredients and the burger was actually pretty moist considering it was well done.  We didn't get the truffle fries because the serving size is huge and there's no way we could have eaten all that in addition to our burgers.  They did look very tasty, though.  It would be nice if they had a small side order for $5-6 or something, instead of the 2000 calorie $11 size.
Definitely a cool stop in vegas....good dawgs and burgers!  Great beer selection , chainbreaker was my favorite.  Service was excellent...kitchen was a bit slow but they were packed and the waitress and manager were extremely attentive and always made sure we were ok with our drinks . A++ service!
The burger and onion rings weren't bad. But Shake #4 (creme brulee and Oreo shake) was AMAZING!! It was literally the best I had in my life. . . The waiting line wasn't too long, but when we finally made it to the front of the line, the hosts seemed to ignore us and instead helped the random people coming up to them with questions.
Food is good. I had chicken wings. They were breaded (did not say breaded on menu). They are the drumstick part only. Good sized drumsticks but fatty. A little too fatty for my taste. Too much fat makes them slimy under the skin. I would not order them again. Service was good. Nice servers working their butts off. Steve had the Standard Dawg. It was huge!!! He liked it a lot.
Overall, overrated. . Yes, the patty was cooked perfectly but there was nothing special to the taste of the burger. The truffle fries were too greasy and salty. I expected so much more from the celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsey, who seems to be such a perfectionist in the Hell's kitchen show. The service was good and the shake was good too. But I won't go back to pay $13-16 to get a burger with mediocre taste.
Literally the best burger I've ever ordered. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. Staff was great. Very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended.
Best burger I've had! Generous size! . . Euro burger: goat cheese, arugula, tomatoe and Truffle Aiolie !!. . Service was average.  Waitress friendly and helpful.
