I've been to this place plenty of times before, & every time I've been here, I would definitely give 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because our server Scheila, was just completely horrible last night. I had an iced tea that didn't get offered to be refilled once. She kept refilling our waters but didn't ask at all if I wanted more iced tea. Of course I had to ask for it... I don't know if you pay by the glass for iced tea at this resturant but it would still be a little nice for her to ask. I don't think she even asked if we were doing ok the whole time we were sitting! The meat of course was beyond amazing. The lobster bisque is what I look forward to every time I'm headed here, if you haven't had it, you need to try it. It is one of the best soups I've ever had! Not exaggerating. We wanted more of the fried bananas and it felt like we had to hunt down our server for more. After all the food we had no idea where the waitress, so it was like an hour until we got our check. This is the first time we had a discount here, it was something like a buy one get one free coupon. Thank goodness we had that or else I would of been a little disappointed spending full price on the service we got. I'm thinking this whole bad service thing is because we were sitting in the corner, right next to her drink stand. But at the same time, you'd think she would come to the drink stand more often & see us. I'm not sure. I will definitely be back to this resturant because I love it so much, I will just remember not to ask for her.
Salad bar is awesome with everything you could possibly want.  The top sirloin was my favorite but everything was wonderful.  The chocolate moose cake was to die for!!!  Good service and atmosphere... Maybe just a tad on the pricy side.
I'm so looking forward to returning to Texas de Brazil tonight! It has been two years since I have dined here and it was simply enjoyable and tasty. Not to mention it's a bit entertaining in selecting what to eat as it arrives at your table. We found the atmosphere to be fun and casual elegant. Drinks were great as well.. . I haven't tried any desserts yet but am oh so willing to tonight... Will letyou know. ;)
This place is awesome!! Love it! Service was the best. The meats were amazing. The soups, salad bar, and deserts were all great! Definitely will return and I highly recommend everyone try's this place. We went for lunch. $36 per person. Kids are half price. And I think kids under 4 or 5 years old are only $5. You can't beat that for the quality and service this place offers!!
Best Brazilian bbq in town hands down. Great staff nice environment.  My only concern was giving this 5 stars was that it would get even harder to get a table.
I love this place! The staff here are always friendly and the online reservation works great. Today on our reservation I didnt realize that I accidently picked tomorrows date. But the hostless worked with us and was able to squeeze us in instead of making us wait an hour and a half. The food is always amazing and thr salad bar has a ton of options. Management will stop by your table and ask you how dinner is and if theres anything they can do for you. I like how their customer service is. Great for large parties too!
Lobster bisque! Perfectly grilled meats brought to your table. Outstanding salad bar worthy of five stars itself. Five star service. Enough said.
Superb experience. Loved the veriety of dishes at the buffet and ample choice of grilled meats surved to table. Even though there is some inconsistency with the meat preperation, it's mostly satisfying.. It is also advised to come here very hungry since there is so much good food to try..
Best meat Rest. In the world - period !. MEAT - 9/10. Salad bar - 9/10. Service - 10/10 !. Parking - Free. Atmosphere - GREAT !. All and All - VERY Recommended !!!
Typical Brazilian Steakhouse.  . . You can go here or Fago, it's all the same.  Some people say that Fago tastes better because of the smokiness and/or the taste of the grill.  To me, it is all good.  Just don't spend too much time at the salad bar.
Absolutely loved this place! I travel a lot and have spent more money on eating out than any many should. Often, after eating the meal, any memory of it quickly fades into the abyss of meals past. However, Texas de Brazil was a memorable experience, not just a meal. The food was superb, the service spectacular, and the presentation was unique.
I forgot how much I really LOVE this place!. We use to go here alot, but it may have been almost two years since I've last been.. I'm really glad I revisited!. . The meats, the saltiness, the variety of sides, the sangria! .. I really don't know what more to ask for! My favorite meat has got to be their house special - Piccanya (?).. It's melt in your mouth, tender, fatty goodness! Also, their flank steak was delicious that night! They a variety of different beefs, porks, lambs and chickens always in a rotation. As long as you leave your little card green, they're going to keep coming!. . As far as their sides they have soup, salads, meats, cheeses, breads, sauces.. and this is really silly, but their Jasmine rice here is soooo AMAZING! Maybe it's just the Filipino in me that really enjoys eating rice and meat BUT I can't get enough of it.. That's really all I eat as far as the sides!. . Our sangria was mixed well and paired with our meal! I believe it was $25 for a whole pitcher (about 6 glasses) compared to the $10 per glass.. . Also can't complain about their service .. Attentive and friendly!. I can't wait for my next visit!
Even after being open for a few years this place is still amazing!  The service is excellent for the most part (we had one "hide the meat waiter" walk by us about 10 times as if we weren't there). There will be a wait time at least 45 minutes to an hour on a Friday or Saturday night. The meat is delicious and you should barely take anything from the salad bar if you want to enjoy the meat! You will fill up on salad, which means you're paying $50.00 for it! The fried bananas are divine and work great as dessert substitute.
