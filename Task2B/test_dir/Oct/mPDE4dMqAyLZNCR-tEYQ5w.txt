Not the best Cirque show on the LV strip...would be an understatement!  If you have never been to a CDS show, you won't  know the difference. But for those of us who have seen 9+ different CDS shows, Ka will be a HUGE disappointment.  Slow,  boring story, VERY weak "acts" if that is what you call them. I think I could have performed in parts of this show!  If you get the tickets for free or for $20-30, OK.
Now I am a huge fan of Cirque, but I am not a fan of Ka.  The scenery was amazing and so were the costumes.  But there was hardly any acrobatic stunts.  And the story was a little off for me.  I would not go again.
AMAZING.... . I never seen a scene like this before, it was enormous taking the whole room as part of the show!!!. . The story is great and the cirque du soleil crew was at its best again.. . Great show, great night!
Two words, loved it!!:) . Amazing performance, after seeing other cirque du soliel shows, I can say this is the best... If you are torn between this and others, go with this, you won't regret it :)
Purchased discounted tickets for the show.  The costumes were beautiful and a huge stage.  The show itself was OK, the stunts were amazing.  There were parts of the show, when my husband and I both fell asleep-it's an operaish musical with acrobats. If that is your cup of tea, then you will enjoy it.  For us, we wouldn't go again-to put things in perspective, we loved Jersey Boys, music we were familiar with and a story that we could understand.
MIND BLOWING!!!!. . Im sorry, to those reviewers giving this show anything less than 5 stars must be blind.. . Just returned back from Las Vegas and witness this act and all I can say is that my jaw is still on the floor. From the minute you're picking up your refreshment, you know this is going to be something unlike before. They have the mood set out just right and look above you cause there will be people playing insturnements. . . Walking in, they will walk you to your seat cause this place is HUGE! . . The stage is something I have never witnessed in my life. It has massive, heavy stages the go in and out while spinning 360. . . To the people who participate in this show,. SPOT ON WITH EVERYTHING! Thank you for your hard work. I can't imagine the constant strain on the body like you guys. . . A must see show!!! . . The story line goes along just fine.
That was definitely not a waste of ton for money. The show was breathtaking, would definitely see it one more time. And I'm going to other Cirque du Solei's shows for sure
Just saw this show. What garbage. It was so bad I walked out 3/4 of the way. Virtually no amazing acts. Mystere and Zarkana and O blow this show out of the water. . . Severely disappointed especially for what they charge. Invest your money in one of the other Cirque shows. They are way better. This is the weakest one.
They completely ruined KA with their changes. We were puzzled why so many seats were empty at the start of the show. Unfortunately, we didn't understand why until the end. . . We realize that a performer died during the final epic fight scene back in 2013. The problem is that over a year later, they don't warn you that the very reason to see KA has been replaced with a pre-recorded, CGI performance on a what amounts to a giant TV screen. It doesn't help that the projection is dim and blurry either.  We did not pay nearly $300 to see an out of date, low-res video game cut scene. I've watched way better cut scenes on my PS3. . . They eviscerated the show by removing what was once the primary selling point. It is even still sold as if the final scene is live by having advertising and promo material still featuring scenes of it from older performances. Nice bait-and-switch. . . Someday maybe they'll do the right thing and redesign the show to make it worthwhile again. Until then, see any other Cirque show. In fact, see one two or three times before seeing this one. And definitely don't pay full price.
You know I love this show the first time I saw  it years ago... There are so many reasons I want to love it still, but I was quite disappointed at the video quality and for the price of $200 a ticket the theater was empty. I will say I still love the theater, I still love the stage, costumes, etc... but I wont be back.
