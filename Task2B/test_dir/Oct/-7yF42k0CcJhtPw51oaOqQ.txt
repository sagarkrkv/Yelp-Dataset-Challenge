Writing this review from our suite.  Stayed here two nights,. . 1.  We had to wait 1 hour to get into our suite as it was not ready.. . 2. I asked for a late checkout as my wife was not feeling well.  We were told "no, someone already rented your suite". . . 3. The mini bar has stuff missing when we got there.. . 4. Room was not very clean.  . . 5. Oh, I am writing this review from the suite, just before our checkout.. . STAY away from this place.  Not worth it,. . Plus staff has a shitty attitude.
Always nice! Large casino floor, spacious lobby, love the conservatory and the choroegraphed fountains!
This hotel has truly gone down hill. We checked in.. which was fine.. when we got to our room the door was already  unlocked. Come to find out the door doesnt need a key at all you can just open it because  it never locked. I actually got one of the housekeepers to see if this was suppose to happen or if there was some trick to keep it locked. She confirmed that it wasnt suppose  to do that... so called front desk to tell them we needed a new room and one that locked. It took them a good minute to fix the issue. It was a sunday night and  the lobby was dead so it wasnt like they were busy. When getting into our second room we had a half full drink in the refrigerator.. that made us feel like cleaning clearly doesnt happen. I understand that they're other people using the room before us.. but man can you make sure i dont have to clean their mess.. thats a little  nasty to me. I called the front desk again and they put the blame in the ventor people.  Hmmmmm so its there fault that you keep low cleaning standards. Such an inconvenience coming here and not having  the level of service you expect. I felt like i was staying at the holiday inn.
Fabulous from top to bottom!  Got in late and were upgraded to a fountain view suite!
Amazing! I've always wanted to stay at he Bellagio and it lived up to all my expectations. We booked a fountain view room and the view was amazing. Spacious, luxurious and the best view on the strip. Front desk staff was friendly although lines were long. Definitely recommend checking out online to avoid the lines. We ate at a few cafes and the service was great. My only complaint was we left our room about 11AM  to go down to the pool and when we came back at 3 our room still had not received service. There was a voice message stating we had to call to get our room maid up, a little annoying but if that's my only complaint then not too bad. Would most definitely stay here again!
for my bday the bf wanted to surprise me with a trip to VEGAS!!! . . We stayed here for 2nights/3days.  We had THE best view of the fountains! Room 26-085! talk abt ballerrr!!! . I can watch the watershows ALL day!!! . . My review is basically the same except this time, a different room makes a difference! You MUST get the fountain view room, its well worth it! . . I really love the new Tiesto water work show! . . Ivan, the bellman, u my friend are the greatest! So friendly and helpful!
Great place to stay. Truly a five star resort. Swimming pool is pretty nice, if I had to find a down side it would be that. Otherwise the place is top place in Vegas.
There's been plenty of reviews about this place so I'll make it brief:. . What I like:. - It's the fucking Bellagio.  While that probably meant more 10 years ago, it's still a great casino to stay/visit.. - Rooms are nice and pretty comfortable.. - The location is excellent - right in the middle of the strip.. - The restaurant options are solid.  I actually liked the Le Cirque here better than in NYC (better service IMO).. - Buffet is good.  While it's not the best in town anymore, it's still pretty decent.. - Beautiful garden and lobby area.. . What I don't like:. - As expected the table games cost more here.. - Love the luxury stores but wished they had more mid-tier shopping options. - Traffic in this area sucks ass.  Here's where the prime location can also suck.. . Generally speaking you can't go wrong staying here.  But if you're not a high roller or in the mood to spend a ton to eat all the time, you may want to gamble/dine at one of the many casinos nearby.
Loved this place!! My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio while friends and family chose more trendy upscale hotels (ehem Vdara).  We had such a pleasant stay! The room was gorgeous and most important of all CLEAN! The housekeepers did an excellent job with the room.  The only problem we encountered was with the bell hop desk, the lady there was a bit rude but when I snapped back her attitude changed.  They brought up toothbrushes I had requested and some surprise chocolates (that made my day!!).  At the end of our trip our friends shared the horror stories they had at other hotels, that were equally if not more expensive.  My husband and I had not one complaint.  I recommend this hotel, especially since I am extremely picky when it comes to my hotel rooms.
We stop by each time we visit to look at the garden inside and to watch the fountains.  This year my mother in law was having difficulty walking.  The folks at the front desk let us borrow a wheelchair for free for an hour or so.  This is much more than we were allowed at some of the other big hotels.  Seeing their displays was much nicer when we didn't have to worry about a family member being run into by other tourists.
Freaking amazing.... gorgeous hotel. Went to Hyde and danced all night long.. ate late night at the cafe. We felt like tourists. ..best night out in a very long time!!!
Initial note: I've been here just a couple of days of my 6 day stay, so I will update my review (good or bad) at the end of the stay.. . Review:. . The Bellagio is a place I want so hard to like because it is absolutely gorgeous. I've been to Vegas a couple of times, but both times, I've stayed on Caesar's, which has been more than excellent. . . My issue with the Bellagio began with the bellman. I was asked three times when I was wheeling my luggage into the hotel (all one bag) if they could grab it. I politely told them 'No thank you.' They all responded by making a snide sound or rolling their eyes or throwing their hands in the air. Totally unprofessional. . . The next issue was the most major, because it reinforced the idea of the Bellagio that I got upon my arrival - that the employees are snobs. I played Craps countless times, and the dealers were just flat out rude, especially when I would have bets taken down and cashed out (I would imagine because I was up). This happened on three different occasions with 3-4 different employees. One was a higher up with a tie, overseeing a chip deposit to our table. . . My next issue was the room itself. The temperature would not adjust. The room is a smokehouse, and while the temperature reads 65, there is no way it is above 73.. . Next was the food. Every place I ate at (that was a quick grab -  not a restaurant) was twenty minutes to fill an order. It shouldn't take that long to make a pastrami on rye sandwich! This occurs multiple times.. . Having had very positive experience at Caesar's, I don't know if I'll ever return to the Bellagio, and that just isn't to stay, I will no longer gamble there either (for the rest of my trip, I'll be gambling at Caesar's or somewhere else). . . I hope that someone reads this because the Bellagio is such a beautiful hotel. Everything is set up to be perfect. Some of the employees aren't executing it like they should be and it's ruining the experience.
I had such high expectations of the Bellagio that the overall experience was somewhat disappointing. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. It's the first time we've stayed here and will be the last time.  There were some definite pros to the hotel but the cons just outweighed them. Let's start with the pros: the hotel itself is beautiful, the water show throughout the day was great, the valet service was very fast each time we dropped off and picked up our vehicle, the elevators were also fast, no wait at all to get on, the bathroom was a great size (enough for both of us to get ready at the same time). Now on to the cons: we stayed in a nonsmoking room yet our floor still wreaked of smoke, the room left much to be desired (for what we paid we assumed the room would be grander than it was) but the worst part and the reason I won't be back is because of the bed. It was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in. Hard as a rock, the floor might have been softer. I woke up every morning with my body in pain (and I'm in my 30s). If your not interested in a good nights sleep after a day of having fun than this is the place for you!
Old tired room. Noisy drain. Spring on door that is supposed to automatically close the door doesn't work, iron so calcified that I had to have it replaced, smells like air freshener, hilton garden in feels better.. . Will pick a different hotel next time
We stayed here on our last trip to Vegas.. It is simply THE PLACE to stay on the Strip while visiting Vegas!!. Situated conveniently in the middle of the Strip, it enables you to stay in the lap of luxury while being close to all that Vegas has to offer.. It definitely isn't cheap but totally value for money.. Don't miss the lavish lunch buffet, and definitely you can't afford to miss the world-famous Bellagio fountains! :)
Rooms were very nice & the hotels location is the best in Vegas!  Tons of great restaurants & the gaming is also fun!
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!  This is one of my top 2 high class fav casinos in Vegas!  It's beautiful, classical and the fountains are amazing!!  It truly is a joy to walk through!  The gaming floor is great, the waitresses quick and plenty and honestly I've never had a bad experience here that I can think of!  I love the glass sculptures and there are plenty of shops to check out!  This casino is a grand centerpiece to the Vegas strip in my mind!
Stayed at Bellagio last week for business.  Overall comments are similar to other reviews:  great location, good dining options, great pool.  We had a fountain view room that let us see the water show with the Eiffel Tower in the background - beautiful.  . . The only downside was a strange high-pitched noise that would arise suddenly for a few minutes and then disappear.  We guessed it was one of our neighbors using the shower, but -- fortunately -- it only happened during the day and not while we were sleeping.. . I was going to give only 4 stars because of the noise, but something happened that pushed them over the edge.  Upon arriving home, my wife realized she forgot to check one drawer - the one with her jewelry and a few expensive items of clothing.  I called immediately, spoke with the lost and found department (clearly we weren't the only ones that had forgotten something) and was pleased to find that not only had they recovered all of the items, they overnighted everything to us (free of charge) the next business day.  . . The housekeeping staff we encountered and all very friendly, but being 2.000 miles away we had little hope that we'd ever see the items again.  The integrity and friendliness of their staff in helping us through this issue (which was clearly our error) was enough to earn them 5 stars - and our future loyalty the next time we head to Vegas!
This hotel is very nice and have most of the brand name shops which makes convenience for the guests.  We had tried a few restaurants in the Bellagio and they all are very good, but expensive.  As for the Casino, my husband and I like it here than the Venetian.  I didn't give Bellagio a 5 stars is bc we didn't think the room is all that nice.  We used to stay at the Venetian, but this time we wanted something different.  The services here are excellent.
This place is TOP NOTCH! Their garden is always changing each time I come here. Their fountains are known around the world. Their buffet is probably the best I've ever eaten at! I give this place a solid FIVE STARS! Everyone who goes here is classy and HOT! Even if you do not gamble or stay in their rooms, it's worth it to just GO IN and see what it's got to offer! You'll be taking plenty of pictures, I guarantee you that! I totally love their fountain shows which go off everyday! Each time I put my money into their slot machines, I might as well say good bye to it because I've never won anything back here.. lol! But this place is definitely worth a visit!
WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD!!!.  . . We booked this hotel for my birthday. It was pretty expensive so we believed we would have gotten great service for the amount of money we paid for the room. . The room was nice but we asked for a room with 2 beds (there were 4 of us and only one bed) when i requested the change the person helping us was snoobish, rude and sighing. . .  When we requested help with our bags 4 or 5 times NO ONE helped us. They actually ignored us and started helping couples behind us. When we requested  something to help us stack our luggage so we could carry it ourselves we then again IGNORED. When we finally got our luggage downstairs the bell man made a derogatory remark about mexicans walking their luggage down (refering to us) to another staff member. . . While playing in the casino there was barely any servers and it took almost 45 minutes to get drinks that we ordered.. . It was definitely a beautiful hotel but all staff was absolutely rude. It wasnt worth the money. Hopefully you read this before you stay, I am definitely picking a different hotel next time.
Stayed in room 21641; the elevator took forever to take us up to that level but that's expected of hotels in Vegas. The decor was nice and clean. The view was boring....nothing too spectacular. . The worst part of it all was when we were trying to sleep could hear the toilet flushing upstairs that grossed me out and prevented me from sleeping.. Room service was good. Called for breakfast at 5 am and got it in 20 min. It cost  around $35 for a latte and a plate of eggs, potatoes, Ham and a tomato. It was pretty good and made me super full. I loved room service the food was better than the buffets all over Vegas. I enjoyed my visit but don't know if I'll come back...
We have stayed at the Bellagio a number of times in the last 5 years.  It has been a 5 star venue for us because of their excellent customer service, luxurious appointments, great location and amenities, etc.. . But things seem to be going downhill.  I blame it on wear and tear, not just of their rooms and facilities, but in the casino, and most regrettably with customer service.. . Bellagio remains a high-end hotel.  Shops are expensive as are the eateries.  I am not a whale, my wife and I are not extravagant in our dress (she does like her shoes and purses, though), but we have usually been treated with respect and there has always been that extra effort to accommodate our needs.. . During our last two stays?  Not so much.  It's intangible..... a look you get, hesitation before a response, a smile that doesn't seem right......I don't think it's my imagination, or is it....no.....maybe....... . Last year, someone got into our room.  We didn't have anything taken, but a box of candy was half eaten and a bottle of water was gone.  We reported it and were not charged, but hmmm.....who has access to our room (I know I locked up), an employee?. . When I play the slots, I'm always collecting change as I cash out my tickets.  We were killing time before we were to leave for the airport and I had acquired a pocketful of change. I went to the cashier cage and asked if she could take my change because I had a plane to catch.  She practically laughed in my face.  I was tempted to do something rash, but we needed to get out of Dodge and I let it slide.  If I had reviewed the place then, it would have gotten one reluctant star from me... . This last time, we were comped 3 nights and we gave the Bellagio one more try.  It was a much better stay.  Check-in wasn't so stressful.  Maid service was good, and they now have a change counting machine in the casino.. . The Bellagio is still a great hotel, but iit's lost some if its sheen.  Definitely not what it was 5 years ago.  T
Maybe Bellagio was something back in the day but it just seems tired now. Starting to notice numerous coats of paint on door and window frames and that just looks shabby. The Fountains? Yep they're amazing. The museum of fine art? Can't say because it was closed for a month for installations. Food choices are ok. Some coworkers here for a convention with me mentioned their carpet floors weren't clean, with one having a toothpick and a breath mint in plain sight on the floor upon check-in.. I had a good time at the table games but dealers seemed not too happy... maybe that's an MGM corporate thing but who knows. The energy here just left me feeling kinda blah. Oh don't complete your check-out on the tv until you are actually ready to leave the property because your keys immediately deactivate.
