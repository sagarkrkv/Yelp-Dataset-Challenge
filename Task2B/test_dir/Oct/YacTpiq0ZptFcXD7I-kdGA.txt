Nice place. Good steaks, delicious sides, good service. A bit overpriced, but not bad for Vegas. The only problem was with my salad. The egg was overcooked, and when I asked for another, they didn't bring a new salad, just a new egg, which turned out to be overcooked as well. I gave up and started eating the salad anyway, and when I pulled out a long dark curly hair, I stopped. They took the salad away, and three people apologized, but they didn't offer me another appetizer. They did make up for the unconvinced by comping our corkage, dessert, and, of course, the salad. It was a nice way to make up, but we didn't find out about that until the end of the meal.
The steak was cooked perfectly and was worth the price. In addition, we ordered the truffle potato chips and devoured them in minutes. I also got a lychee drink which was pretty good but probably too expensive for me to ever order again. But if we're ever back in Vegas, we'll be sure to drop by this restaurant again for the steak!
Ate there back in April.  Man what a great place. My friend and I had the NY Strip with the twice bake potato and caesar salad was good.  Plan on trying a steak house over at Caesars Palache's in January but may be heading back to Delmonicos as well.
Bone-in ribeye was the bomb.. . They cook the steaks as precise as you could get for medium and medium rare lovers out there.  No need to temperature down when being asked in anticipation of the kitchen cooking the crap out of your steak, what you ask for is what you get.. . I was here was some buddies for a random Vegas trip and we decided to do it big at Delmonico.  The experience was great.  The ambiance is a little bit more on the "date night" side of the spectrum, but the service is awesome and the steaks and sides are delicious.  . . Make reservations and don't stress about the price, it's a special occasion.  Even if it's not a special occasion, it will be when you steak comes at exactly the right temperature.
Impeccable service & the ambiance was right on. We had the cowboy ribeye and was top notch, the au gratin potatoes were recommended and was not let down and the mushrooms were OH SO GOOD! We were over stuffed but had to try the infamous banana cream pie.... AMAZING.
After a quick drink at Public House, I was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. Here's how my conversation with our waiter began:. . Me: "What kind of bread is this?". Waiter: "They're popovers sir.". Me: "Has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?" . Waiter: "Haha, no sir, very good observation sir." . . Yup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. They were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. Despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. . . The recommended lobster bisque was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. There were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. Delmonico is known for their bone-in ribeye so I ordered that medium-rare. The steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. No steak is complete without a side of creamed spinach, which was done well. All sides are portioned to be shared. Despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in NY strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.
Great steak but disappointing service for the price.  Went here for a friend's bachelor party.  We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.
Walked in on a Sunday evening, no reservations. Portion sizes are excellent especially for the price and the upscale vibe. Was thinking it was going to be small portions, but not so. The bone-in ribeye and their special of the day, bison short rib, were delicious and cooked to perfection. Would definitely come back. Very trendy busy, but worth the experience: excellent.
Great Experience. We had a couple of friends in town and this place came highly Recommended. The cherry martini is so good! I could eat a bowl of the liquor soaked cherries they put in it! We had the bbq shrimp, lobster bisque, and the bacon for appetizers! We ate those too quickly to get pics! The guys got Rib Eyes. Ladies got fillet both were stellar! The ribeye had more flavor! The sides we got we're all great. Asparagus, twice baked potato, creamed corn, and potato Gratin. For dessert, Banana Cream Pie and Pineapple upside down cake. Our bill before tip was over $400 but well worth every penny!
Hands down the best steak I've ever had, the bone in ribeye was amazing! I loved the garlic mushrooms and the twice baked potatoes too. Not only was the food perfect but the service was phenomenal. My friends and I popped in off the street with no reservation and not dressed up at all. Even though we completely stood out, we were shown to out seats immediately and we didn't get one dirty look from any of our 3 waiters!  I will return to vegas in the future if only to eat here again!!!!
Steak was very good, sides were ok, and our waiter was helpful but didn't look to be overly excited about working.
