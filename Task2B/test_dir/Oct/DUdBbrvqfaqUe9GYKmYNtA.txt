BEST hotel in Las vegas , has the best food and the best accommodations.  Everyone is very friendly. I love the pool it is very exotic.  It has alot to do and I have won 2 times at their casino. Every time I come to vegas I make sure I stay at the mirage.
Had an invite to come here for a comped holiday weekend and we took it.. Checked into a nicely decorated, clean room not so far from the elevator. Made getting around the property quick and easy.. . I really liked this place. Service was friendly and professional in each and every department that we encountered.. . Saw the Beatles "Love" Cirque Soliel show which was pretty cool.. . Casino was bustling, drink service was timely, tables were a good mix all around.. . We also had a great driver from the Aria that took us back to the airport from the Mirage. I forgot his name unfortunately. An ex-Service member from San Diego.. . . Thanks to Sonny M. for making it happen. We'll be back.. . Cheers to all
I LOVE THIS PLACE! I don't know how any of you can say anything negative about the Mirage. Did we not stay at the same hotel?. . I will start with their taxi stand. I think that they have a very organized system. Jason (I think thats his name) is AWESOME! My husband and I stayed there in April and he remembered us every single time. My husband and I also stayed at the Mirage in September AND HE STILL REMEMBERED US!! I was so blown away! AMAZING!. . The check in line does look pretty long. Especially because check in is usually at 3pm unless you request/pay for early check in. Don't be fooled though. The line moves pretty quickly. However the check in/concierge staff is very efficient. . . The rooms are nice. I mean if you ARE paying for a standard room, don't expect a huge amount of space with a gorgeous view. You do get what you pay for. I would also like to note I love their elevator system. They have about six or so different areas to take you to your room. So like the first area is for floor 1-5 the second area is like 6-10 etc. There are also about six elevators in each area. I really love this system because you are never waiting for an elevator. The elevator is never full. & each elevator only goes up a certain amount of floors. We've all had those horrible experiences where we are at the 24th floor, but other people in your elevator are on floor 8, 12, 19, and 21. HOW ANNOYING. That problem NEVER happens at the Mirage!. . The housekeeping staff is very friendly. You are always greeted while walking down the hall!. . I also love the Mirage casino. I think that the casino here ISNT as smokey as some other casinos. I think the high ceilings near the waterfall help. Also, the casino is very easy to navigate around, unlike Caesars. Eeek. . . I think there are good dining options here, different varieties. However, no cheap food court like options, except for Starbucks. Although if you are staying on the strip, you should expect to pay a lot for food!!. . LOVE love LOVE the Mirage!! Will definitely be back!
This is our go-to hotel when staying in Vegas...mostly because of the location (close to Fashion Show Mall and Carnaval court). But stayed here again two weeks ago for the Mayweather fight and again, impressed with the service, cleanliness of our room, and available eateries. We love Carnegie...ate here 3x and always good stuff! The Pool is nice as well, love the waterfalls and just a laid back feeling there. Even took advantage of the spa this time and that alone was heaven!
Had thousands of dollars stolen from my room, WHILE I WAS SLEEPING. The hotel didn't have cameras in the halls, therefore they were unable to find the thief. Was instructed to deadbolt the door because these professional thieves have their own ways to bypass the key system. I guess this could have happened at any hotel, but I think that the mirage management and security were aware of this problem and did not take appropriate steps to prevent it from happening again.
I was excited to stay in a suite at the Mirage as it has always been one of my favorite casinos, but was very disappointed.  The suite was very nice, but that was about it.  I had my 5 year old with me and there is no where you can watch a baseball game and there in-room tv service did not offer the channel the playoff game was on (FS1).  Some of the staff was borderline rude for a highly rated hotel.  . . The  sportsbook (when I finally went) is a joke.  Most of the seats are reserved only and alcohol prices are about that of going to a really nice bar.. . If you have a kid forget it, not kid friendly even though they have the dolphins and tigers etc.  If you don't have a kid forget it, for the price there are much better out there on the strip.. . Again the suite was nice, but for the money it is notworth it given everything else.  What happened to you Mirage?  I will miss you as I will not be returning!
We stayed at Mirage as a teen with my parents and remember when it was a relatively classy place. But 1 employee ruined all of this. When he spouted a racist comment to the family in front of us because they had a lot of bags and a stroller. We managed to get the name of this employee. Farzad Keyhan has ruined the memory of the Mirage. I have no idea why this casino would employ this man. I haven't been there in years as we usually stay at MGM, but we had a last minute change in our plans and MIRAGE was offering a great deal.. . Booked two rooms through third party site. Confirmed with MIRAGE res line on way to hotel. At check in upon checking in this Farzad guy must have been getting off work and had a couple or was tired which I understand but yelling at a family then stating go back to your own county after yelling that strollers aren't allowed is ridiculous....especially when he himself appeared to obviously not have been born in the United states is ridiculous. Attention Mirage management... reel this guy in or fire him your casino has its history and doesn't need this.. . Would not return if rooms were free. Avoid.
Was there for a convention. Nice, clean, house keeping staff was very friendly. Would stay again if back in Vegas.
the mirage is centrally located on the strip, and they have some great shows (terry fator, beatles love, tosh, boyz II men, etc.). .  the rooms are ok, but i was given one that faced the freeway behind the strip. there was no view whatsoever. also, i hate when they charge you $10 each for multiple sodas that you didnt drink, just for opening the fridge and touching anything. they should do away with that terrible sensor system.. . the worst part was that they closed the pool early on saturday for a private wedding. this would not have been a problem, had they just told me ahead of time! then i could have planned accordingly.
I love this hotel. Not because its the newest or swankest. Not because it has the finest restaurants in Las Vegas but because it is one of the friendliest. The people who work there, save for one Filipino woman at the M Life station, are all amazing. They genuinely care about the quality of your stay and the rooms, specifically, the beds are incredibly comfortable. . . I am a slots whore and they have an amazing and diverse selection to play. . . And you can't beat the prices for their rooms. Very reasonable. If you play their games, they comp you and they appreciate your patronage in a very old school way. Not in a contemporary, insincere way. They want your business whereas other, newer hotels make you feel like you are just lucky to be there. . . I feel at home at this hotel. I feel respected and I feel joy. . . Come to the Mirage people and judge for yourself.
**For standard room only**. . Everything is really clean, no odor, and would definitely stay here again. Staff is super friendly and helpful. What makes this even more awesome is I got it for free. I play the my vegas app on my phone and used my point to her this room!
Mirage is a unique place on the strip with lots of heritage and timeless ambiance.  The quality of the dinning and shows are always great but you will need a fat wallet to be comfortable with the prices.  And jog course you will need extra if you gamble !!!   . . When here we always remember Siegfried and Roy  performances with the lions - that dug its teeth into Roy's neck carnying him off stage trying to protect him for some perceived danger !!!  The show and tragedy are historic.  Today the special feature is always the water show out front !!!
We came out from Colorado to enjoy a few nights comped.  The room is mosly clean but they do not clean on 2nd, 3rd day.. . I was turned down on myvegas comps due to fine print.. . Very few video poker games.   Overall it it nice and friendly but that leaves it time to do better.  Otherwise....a two star.
Have been coming to Vegas consistently for the past 10 years, first time staying here was this past spring and I really enjoyed it. Very nice lobby, they have recently redone their facility, much nicer than before. Loved the pool area, food was good for the price. Stayed the Mandalay Bay a few month later, hands downmy favorite hotel in Vegas, and comparing poolside drinks the Mirage had a much better selection and taste/price.
Rude and unhelpful front desk.  Beds are highly uncomfortable and bathrooms that feel old and dirty.  Used to like this hotel but not after this visit.
We were married this past weekend and decided to splurge and get two two-bedroom tower suites. The price was about half the rest of the suites we looked at and we were incredibly happy!. . The suites were gorgeous! Large and clean and beautiful! We had California king beds in both rooms. This was large enough to fit three people in one bed comfortably if your having more than four people with you. . . The beds were incredibly comfortable! And the room service fantastic! The only problem we had was dealing with the elevators. It required a key card to go up and so you had to ensure you always had a key card with you. At one point our family and wedding photographer got stuck in the elevator, but they gave us room credit and it was nice that the hotel responded so favorably. Any issues we had were promptly resolved and without hassle. . . We also went to the Love show. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely suggest it for anyone staying at the hotel. The grooms party went to the Brazilian steakhouse and it was delicious! . . All in all we loved this hotel!!! Everything was handled smoothly (and if it wasn't, we were appropriately compensated for our hassle) and everything was quality. . . I think this is my new favorite hotel on the strip!
Had a conference this week and stayed here. Not a huge fan of vegas because of the smoke and over the top gambling everywhere.  However as for my room it was awesome.  I was able to upgrade my room to a penthouse 1 bedroom suite for just a bit more then I was paying.  The room was awesome.. . Several tv's and a great view of the city. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was huge.  My wife and I had a great time.
Central location, awesome sportsbook, a lot of dining choices in the hotel or very near.
Myself and a few friends had a disappointing experience at the Mirage in June of 2014. As I look into hotels for an upcoming Vegas trip this winter, I considered the Mirage, then remembered our last stay with them was all too stressful and that I would have to run out of other hotel options before staying with them again. And even then, I would probably prefer to pitch a tent on a sky bridge. . . My friend, Robinson, had booked the room for a college bud reunion, and he specifically chose the Mirage because he enjoyed his previous stays. Despite better prices on comparable hotels, he chose the Mirage because he wanted to give this resort his business. The Mirage had won him over, then lost him very, very quickly. . . Our first night there, we check in and the man at the front desk is lovely. We head up to room, start getting ready for evening plans (the outfit changing, the hair curling, the sipping of champagne, you know the drill) and not even 30 minutes after settling in, we get a knock on the door from security. We were being warned that we needed to "quiet down.". . It was about 8 pm. No later than 8:30. And here is the part where you may not believe me, but I insist, we were NOT being loud. We had music lightly playing and we were chatting as friends do when they haven't interacted in person for months. No girlish screams, no chanting of "shots!"... I wish I had that energy. We are all in our mid-late twenties. Our black-out-drunk/fake ID days are over. . . So, we apologize and we oblige then continue to get ready. 15 minutes later, another knock. This time, security is rude. "One more noise complaint and you guys will be kicked out." Excuse me? It's barely dark out thanks to that summer sun, and you're telling me that Sia crooning softly in the background is upsetting the geriatrics that are next door? . . Fine. Edna and Ralph can't find a way to turn down their hearing aids. So we call the front desk and request a room change. As bitter as I sound now, we really didn't want to ruin anyone else's vacation, so we would have happily switched rooms to save theirs and our own. Our request was denied and we were welcomed to the Mirage with an explanation of the three strike policy. One more call to security, and these neighbors of ours had the power to have us escorted from our room and off of the premises. . . We spent the rest of the night rushing around in silence, trying to ready ourselves as quickly as possible so we could escape the silent prison that was our hotel room. . . Discussing this series of events with management was pointless. We were treated like children. Post-collegiate, money-spending, rule-abiding CHILDREN. . . You guys did give us $25 worth of free drinks at any Mirage bar, but because of the way we were treated, I'm only assuming it was to get us drunk enough to actually kick us out. Jokes on you, $25 is only enough for two cocktails made with one cocktail's worth of liquor. We took our drinking business elsewhere.
very outdated. This place truly needs a facelift. With all the new places on the strip, it isn't the nicest to look at. The rooms are in need, the room service is in need, and the lobby as well. Its where all the priceline and price bargin hunters go to stay. Will never go ever again. For the price you can stay at the Wynn.
