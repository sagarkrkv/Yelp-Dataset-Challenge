I'm not mad at this place! Easy check in...casino in the hotel and plenty of sports gambling. Apparently it was just remodeled which I have no complaints about. First of all I booked a stay there for 2 rooms on a Friday before a long weekend. Only $100 a night can you say winning?! We got there early around 10 am on Saturday they let us check in early and didn't even charge us extra. Is close enough to the strip that it still feels like vegas but at an affordable price. It gets r stars because I like nicer places....but it definitely wasn't a bad deal. I would totally stay here again.
