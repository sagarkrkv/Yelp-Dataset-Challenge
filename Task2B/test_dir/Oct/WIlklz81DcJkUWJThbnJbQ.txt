It was my Husband's and I's first time in vegas and we decided on the Vdara after looking at all the pictures. But after the stay, we were more than impressed. A couple of highlights about the Vdara: its not even a block off the strip (between the Aria and the Cosmo), its Eco-friendly, smoke-free, dog friendly, casino-free, and simple. It was perfect retreat after spending the day on the strip. We had a little kitchenette, a beautiful view, a simple pool, and it was quiet. It was definitely and attraction and the lobby was always bustling, but it wasn't anything in comparison to the other hotels. Its not clique and we really enjoyed ourselves. They were always accommodating and the Spa is drop-dead gorgeous. If it want a life off the strip (but not compromise location), the Vadara is the place to be.
Having been to Vegas more times than I can count, I have stayed in almost every resort on and off the Strip. Recently, I received a great offer from Vdara and my girlfriend and I stayed there while going to a concert at the Cosmo, which is next door. And I can honestly say, Vdara shot up my list as one of my favorite hotels. . . First off, the normal suite was very comfortable. The bed was top notch, as were the pillows. The furniture was very comfortable and the decor was also very impressive. I also love that the hotel prides itself on being energy efficient but it does not forget to be elegant. By that I mean all the modern appliances, like electric window curtains. I was also very impressed with the bathroom, shower and everything else. The electronic keypad is a little odd and I could see how someone who is stumbling back after a fun night may have a little problem with that but alas, that is not the resorts fault. . . Now the other reason for the 5-star review, the concierge was incredible. My girlfriend and I are extremely lactose intolerant but we also want to enjoy food in Vegas. We called down to the concierge and asked for her recommendation for a healthy buffet, kind of an oxymoron I know. However, the concierge called several other MGM Resort buffets and recommended either Aria or the Bellagio. Having eaten at the Bellagio, I was pretty sure that would work but the chef at Aria was willing to give us a personal tour of the each food item and if something had dairy, he would be willing to make it without dairy. We decided on there but before we left, the concierge sent us front of the line passes.  . . I truly wish I remember the woman's name but we were so impressed that obviously she received a nice tip but also we spoke to her manager and told her just how amazing she was. . . Now I gamble, love it actually but I also like staying in a hotel without a casino. I believe that it allows me to have a better nice sleep, I will not stumble into a casino and just try my luck really quick and it was also keeps the drunks and smoke out of the hotel as well. But it is also really close to the tables, this case the Cosmo and Aria. . . My girlfriend and I also love to work out and thought the gym was very impressive. It had a large selection of cardio machines and free weights. It is a tad small but I expect not many people use it. We did not have enough time to visit the pool, even though it looked a little small nor the spa, which was expensive but looked wonderful. . . Overall, if you want a 5-star experience and wonderful customer service, I would highly recommend Vdara. On my many trips back to Vegas, I will always look there first.
Love the executive room!  View of the city is Amazing!
For those of you who love reading reviews that rival War and Peace, this one ain't it. . . But I felt compelled to say a little something after spending the last few nights at Vdarra. . . I have probably been to Vegas 50 plus times in my lifetime and have always stayed in the high-end hotels. Yet, 50 plus times I have been awoken in the middle of the night by a drunk, inconsiderate group coming back to their room at 3:00 a.m. But not this time. No casino and no giant bar scene at Vdarra mean THOSE people are staying SOMEPLACE ELSE.  I didn't hear a peep from anyone for three nights. . . Plus, if you DO want to have a little fun, Cosmopolitan and Aria are literally two minutes away.. . I will be back Vdarra!. . P.S. The staff at Vdarra was great as well.
I would give this hotel 5 stars if it had a casino, but Aria is just a stones throw away so it's not bad. Room: awesome, view: great, service: top notch. I will go back soon.
Good customer service at the front desk. Concierge was not informed properly on show information. They had the wrong times and wrong hotel for a show. The food at the restaurant is good. They off express pass for Aria buffet. The rooms are huge with great views. The rooms are clean. They have washer and dryer full size fridge in the kitchen. It's like a small apartment. Huge tub and a half bath. I would stay again. Instead of the concierge use Google :-). Oh and it's not on the strip. No problem. Free tram to Monte Carlo or walk to the Bellagio they have a covered walkway connected.
Great view, and pretty room. As it should be for the price. BUT, the room was not very clean. Extremely dusty! My allergies were terrible all night. They advertised a kitchen but the cupboards were bare. I've stayed all over the strip and was excited for Vdara, I am disappointed. On my way to the spa now, I hope it's better than the room.
My first time staying here, and I was so impressed! As someone who doesn't gamble or smoke, it was refreshing to stay somewhere that had neither that you had to wade through just to get to the elevators. We stayed in the cheapest suite, which was still beautiful! Nice layout and features - we felt like we booked at an expensive hotel! . . The room service was yummy and the downstairs cafe was good (but a bit pricey). The staff was so wonderful, truly considerate and kind people. I felt like everyone was trained well and there to help us out! . . Also, we liked the free valet parking. I know some people listed that as a negative, but we thought it was great when we checked in around 10 p.m. and were able to just drop off the car with the valet. . . Overall, I loved the Vdara and will definitely be back. It's a great value and really is a way to "Do Vegas Differently."
This is a GREAT room!!! I stayed there last year for memorial day and everthing about the room was Perfect. It is a little price, and please expect to have $300 for a security depost. This I had no idea about, I actually asked the lady when I was booking the room were there any extra rooms and she said No. We got the money back at checkout but it did cut into our spending money. Also They have too different deluxe suite rooms, we got the one that wasn't in the "pictures" on their site, but they did accomadate us with the room we wanted. It was very romantic, and me and my husband had just got married (In Vegas)  so it was everything and more!!! Besides the $300 security deposit I wouldnt have changed a thing, . . Oh and got a $75 food credit on priceline (which was GREAT!!)
The "corner" rooms where two sections of hotel rooms come together are poorly designed. Instead of a corner, our room was indented and when looking out the "corner" window, you see into the other room day and night. The occupants of both rooms can see each other and if glass wasn't in place we could shake hands instead of just waving. . For privacy, the black out shade had to be closed at all times killing the otherwise awesome view of Bellagio fountains. . When requested, maintenance did install a window cover the second night.. Otherwise, a great room and hotel.
Very impressed with the staff and the hotel. We had a great experience here and our penthouse was very nice and reasonably priced. It was a little far from all the good day parties and pool parties but a 10 dollar cab/limo takes care of that even though it is definitely annoying. . My dad has a penthouse at the Hilton Elara and pays twice as much for way less room, not as nice, and a better view. Vdara is a win in my book.
The room was nice but our view sucked. Granted I wanted a low floor because I'm afraid of heights but I'm not sure you'd get a good view from any room since the hotel is set so far back. There is only one place to plug in your things and it's not very convenient. There are no plugs close to the bed. The fridge didn't keep our food cold so we weren't able to eat our leftovers. The tub was the only good part about the room. I will say that the spa is awesome. I really enjoyed it and the staff was great. On the other hand I left a dress there, called the same day to have them find it, and never received a call back. Called the next day and they still hadn't found it and still over a week later haven't called me. The only thing I would do again at the Vdara is the spa.
Went on 10/11/14 and Vdara is the best hotel so far that I stayed in while in Vegas. Booked a room at Treasure Island but really wanted to be in the middle of the strip. Checked out Vdara and the views of the suites are impressive. Loved all the windows and it doesnt make you feel like you're a prisoner by walls and a small window like other hotels.. . Booked the City corner suite but got upgrade to the Executive suite and got the VIP treatment. My host Teresa comp me $100 to charge to my room and was very courteous showing me to my suite. The king size bed was so comfortable and relaxing. Flat screen in master room and living room. Stand in shower, double sink and deep bath tub is very nice. It had a nice kitchen with a electric stove, full size fridge with freezer, coffee maker. Living room had a queen pull out bed, and it also had a half bathroom. Very spacious and modern look.. . When trying to look for the valet it was a little bit confusing and it reminded me of LAX airport. The valet was is the best then any other hotel I been. There is no Casino here but have it at the main hotel at the Aria and is a few minutes to Bellagio hotel which you can take a little bridge and you are inside the hotel of Bellagio. Room service was quick and was set up in our dining room. There is a starbucks located in the lobby.. . Vdara should put a sign or mention it to the guest that you have to show your keycard to the attendant standing next to the elevators. Stopping people going to to their room while there hands are full and stopping to look for the keycard can be a hassle. . .  I would recommend the Hotel to family and friends. By the way I had family spread out the strip and some at old town and were jealous of the views and the suite. Good job Vdara/Aria.
Great Service, Clean rooms and within walking distance to every main attraction in Vegas!!.    The great experience was mainly thanks to the service that Philip provided us. Philip went above and beyond from what we expected!! He was not your typical front desk associate! He guide us as to where to go, when and how!!! :). He was very professional, yet friendly! He provided a sweet and short intro on the grounds and surroundings and even managed to fulfill our request of a high floor!.    This is the kind of service you would expect to get from a 5 Start Resort and are looking like money! . If you stay at this place you will experience what I am talking about! I cannot emphasis enough how impressed I was with Philips hospitality, and it wasn't just him our housekeeping was also very efficient and friendly when we requested the sofa bed to be turned down and more extra towels!! . Thank you to everyone that made our stay as pleasant and one of a kind!! . Will definitely come back and recommend  to close others!! :) . - Thank you Philip and all!!!
My girlfriend and I stayed there for a couple of nights. Great strip access without the smoky casino vibe. The Crystal Shops weren't as impressive as we'd hoped but there are plenty of places to dine and drink nearby (Cosmo, Aria, Mandarin Oriental, MGM). We'll stay here again next time as we prefer this end of the strip and the views were better than at the Trump. Dining at the hotel was limited and the bar in the entry was pathetic but the room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. Has a distinctly contemporary/modern aesthetic.
We were impressed by the service from the moment we checked in, especially Kali.  The concierge was very helpful in arranging all of our different activities, as well as the air race show. The views were incredible, and the location of the hotel is central and has easy access to the Bellagio and Aria.  The room itself was large, the bed was very comfortable.  Our only negative would be that although the weather was beautiful, the pool closed at 5pm, and we would have liked to relax by the pool until a later hour.  Overall, Vdara went a long way towards making our birthday celebration a memorable and special occasion, and we will certainly stay again the next time we visit Vegas.
Pros:. - clean, smoke free hotel. - pretty friendly staff. - central location on the strip. - resort fee includes water each day. - great sized rooms . . Cons:. - takes about 10 mins to get to the strip from the hotel. - small pool area
I stayed here for 2 days with my wife Sept 30th to Oct 2nd 2014. . I had chosen my own price of $95 per day on Priceline and it was accepted.. As expected, the rooms, service, amenities, pool, decor and concierge are all 1st class.. Even ALL the personel were super friendly including the room cleaners and maintenance people.. Electric window shades were cool as well. . . They only have Valet parking which is included in the price. It was efficient and quick.. . The disappointment was that even though everyone must pay their "resort fee" of $25 + $3 tax each day, the use of any steam room or sauna is NOT included. One must pay a hefty daily price to use their "spa". That is really a no-no for me.. The ridiculously high prices at all the restaurants was expected so i just ate in other places or even bought food and kept it in the refrigerator. . . Walking to the strip was about 6 minutes as construction was being done so one has to go through a different parking lot.. . Overall, if you want a 5 star hotel and are willing to pay for all the incidentals along the way, this place is surely a good one.. . Howard S
I had to stay here for a business trip during Magic (the fashion convention) with my boyfriend's company accommodations.. . Literally I have never slept in such an uncomfortable bed. Turns out that some of the beds have no floor board (not sure if that is the correct terminology) and the beds feels mushy and have no support. . . I don't usually experience back issues after sleeping but this bed made me so sore I woke up and took ibuprofen to deal with the pain. . . After complaining to the front desk and house keeping department and almost booking a flight back to Burbank... (A bad night sleep made me not want to be there any more because I was having day nightmares of the upcoming night) The bed did not get replaced... Then my boyfriend complained and followed up with everyone and eventually the housekeeping department installed the floor board and we had a slightly better nights sleep. . . Should it really take 4 complaints and half a day of waiting to make one's bed sleep worthy? My boyfriend and I are not your typical bad back people and I have never in my life complained about a hotel bed up until now. . . To make matters worse our room was being cleaned around 7pm when my boyfriend got back from his fashion convention and he needed to shower and change. The house keeping department had hours to clean it and it never happened. Needless to say we both were floored with the level of service at what appeared to be a nice hotel on the surface. . . Because of all the tragedies occurring I called Cosmo and was so close to switching our rooms and moving hotels. Since this was a company trip and we were not planning on paying for a hotel elsewhere we stayed put. Also I had all of my toiletries and suitcase completely unpacked so it was not easy to just get up and go. . . Moral of the story is Vdara should put those floor boards on every one of their beds and no one should be waiting hours to make their bed suitable for sleeping. Vdara take note please. If someone wants a mushy bed and back pain then they can call you to have it removed. . . Overall this is a very quiet hotel, do not come here if you want your hotel itself to be lively & fun. The Vdara pool area closed so early that we had to go to the Aria pool. I am assuming Vdara closes early to save money... We went to other pools and they were popping with people and music while our hotel's pool looked like a ghost town. . . Other issues with our company rooms- . My boyfriends one brother said he had no shower pressure in his shower. The other brother said they got a handicap room- he said the tub was built differently.. . And to top it off when we came back at midnight their was dirty laundry in the corner of our hall next to several doors within a few feet of our bed. Talk about nasty!!!
Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing.I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria.
Pros:. -VERY friendly staff, even housekeeping would stop to greet us and no one had a snobby attitude.. -Super clean, loved the non-smoking aspect (coming from Oregon).. -Amazing views, loved playing with the blinds throughout the day and night.. -Calm, quiet, relaxing atmosphere (even the other guests were super friendly). . Cons:. -Lack of dining options (however, this did eliminate traffic and noise). -Distance to the strip, had to go through the Bellagio or Aria to get anywhere (difficult after long, clubbing nights). . Overall great getaway, good value, amazing service. Would recommend for those that need a break from the strip life after a long day.
we came here for our anniversary for a 2 night stay. the check in at the front desk was a great experience, probably the best part of our stay. we notated on our reservation that we were in town for our anniversary so the guy who checked us in offered to send up something nice. he even checked if we had any dietary restrictions! . . when we got up to the room, i was a bit disappointed. the lobby is pristine but the room did not reflect the same quality. maybe it was our room but it was so dusty! the room was "clean" but i just felt like i was staying at someone's airbnb guest room versus a 4-5 star hotel. . . the walls are also pretty thin. i could hear people boning from the bedroom area of my suite. when i was in the bathroom, i could hear people talking. . . the pool is okay--they only do drink service so you need to go to the market in the lobby to pick up food. they definitely need to update their poolside menu to reflect that. . . it's all right, but i probably won't stay here again.
I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Starting from valet, all the way to the housekeepers; everyone is nice and willing to help. I've read where people complain about the distance from the strip, but when I come to Vegas, I expect to do some walking anyway. My wife & I used to frequent the Venetian, but this place will probably be our "go to" spot from now on. . . - Keep in mind, this place has NO SELF PARKING, I had to learn the hard way.
We made our first and last visit to Vdara (10/19 - 10/27), We booked 8 nights in the Penthouse Suite and arrived Sunday, October 19 at approximately 11 a.m. When we arrived at the hotel we were directed to go to the front desk to pre-register, and were not invited to go to a priority check-in, which meant we had to wait in a very long line as people were checking out at this time as well. This seemed odd for a penthouse booking as we expected to be given a priority in check-in at the very least and we have seen other reviewers who had the two-bedroom Penthouse and they were offered priority check in, upgraded rooms with views of Bellagio lake, etc. We were offered none of that even though we had requested it months in advance. When we finally got up to the desk to pre-register we were told that the room was not ready, but that we could go ahead and check in and they would call us as soon as the room was ready which they expected to be within about two hours.. So we went to find a place for lunch. By the time we finished lunch it was about 2:00 and we had expected to hear something by then, but we did not, so we called to see if the room was ready. We could not get an answer as to whether or not the room was ready and all that they could tell us is that someone from housekeeping would be tracked down and we would receive a call back as soon as they could get a status. Over 30 minutes passed, so now it was 2:30, and we still had not gotten even a call back to update us as to the status of the room. We called twice between 2:30 and 3:00 from the lobby and were told the same thing, that no one from housekeeping could be reached and that the room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby watching other people check in, go to their rooms and come back down and leave, all the while we sat waiting with no answers and no one trying to resolve the problem. No remedies were offered at all...we were just left in limbo sitting in the lobby.. Finally, at 3:15 out of desperation we got back in the check-in line, waited for another 15 minutes in line, and then when we finally got up to the desk and stated that we had been waiting and that it was now past check-in time, the lady got on the phone trying to get someone from housekeeping to get a status. She told us no one was answering and then she left the counter and said she'd be right back. We have no idea where she went, but she was gone for a long period of time, and finally at somewhere between 3:30 and 3:45 while we were still standing at the counter waiting for her to come back and tell us what was happening, our phone rang and it was housekeeping saying that the room was finally ready, at which point the lady at the desk reappeared. All this time nothing was offered to us, like some complimentary coffee at Starbucks, a couple of drinks in the Vdara bar while we waited, Nothing! This was a completely unacceptable course of events.. The people working the front desk have a very snobbish attitude and really don't seem to care about guests. Most of them don't appear to be experienced enough to work in a luxury hotel.. Why weren't we ever upgraded to a strip view especially when we were not even put in our room until well past check in time? Why didn't anyone take control of the situation and try to resolve it? Why not have us sit and wait in the Vdara Bar having cocktails and snacks to make it an enjoyable experience?. By the time we got to the room and had our luggage brought up, it was well past 4:00. When we finally got to the room it did not have a view of the strip as we had requested. Basically we were looking at and hearing the highway. We could not believe it as we paid for an eight night stay at a Premium 5-Star Hotel Penthouse Suite and spent a significant amount of money to stay in this Penthouse Suite. We have received better accommodations and service at much lower priced hotels in Las Vegas, such as The Signature where we actually had a strip view and a balcony, and were also accommodated on an early check-in with no problems within a reasonable amount of time of arriving. We had to call three days in a row asking for coffee and water, as we were only provided the bare minimum of water and decaffeinated coffee instead of regular coffee. The first time we asked for coffee we were told that there were only three regular caffeinated Keurig coffees left, so we were given the last three. Wow, running out of regular coffee?. They also will bring you an arrival gift - Ours was a bowl with four tiny pieces of rotten fruit versus the Signature, where our gift was a large basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne.. We observed housekeeping cleaning rooms as late as 5:00 pm, when the turn-down service was shortly after that...just didn't make sense. There were days we left by 9:00 am and turned on the housekeeping light so they could come in and clean, and we would come back late in the afternoon (3 - 5 p.m.) and things still were not done.  This was a $5,000 mistake!
It is great...the service ..cleanliness .. Promptness of staff... Location.. prices.... And the amenities.. All are 5 stars... . Location is convenient to many items in Vegas, the overall atmosphere as we enter into the hotel is very welcoming and open.. the lack of a casino is actually a benefits, as you're not bombarded  by it with all the noise ..smoking..distractions.. And people who are loitering in the casino.. I love this place
