port of sin city. SLOT MACHINES. *Gag*. Im not a proponent of sin, I effn hate LV. Ever since my visit in the I wont age myself days and thank you very much ..... and I was inundated with escort type ads, stopped bya gas station and some guy accosts me asking about if I 'work' ummmm Of Course I work ....bum dummy. Till I later find out what 'Work' meant in those parts. The filth. the overtly subliminal signs of darkness all over yonder. Fast forward X years later and bombarded with money machines you have to maneuver through with luggage. Hack. spit. its grungey grimey + the dregs that throng here to indulge in cess. Saw a pack of them descend from new york with their loud obnoxious androgynous shim type cackling. I just eyed them as they slowly disappeared into the bowels of the tunnel they should never return from. did i say I abhor this place. . Strong word but i hate vegas + MIA
You'd think an airport is an airport is an airport.  And you're mostly right, McCarran is great because its so easy to get in and out of, Terminal 1 is kind of congested.. but terminal 3 is amazing... always empty, super fast security.  Airport food is airport food... there the same overprice, under serving bars...
McCarran or LAS is a pretty busy airport being that Las Vegas is such tourist city this place is always bustling.  Their baggage carousels alone take up so much room.  You really cannot help but notice that you can play slot machines while you are waiting for your luggage to come down the chute.  There are gambling machines scattered through out this place which is kind of funny actually.. . While McCarran has a parking garage attached to the terminal their car rental facility is off site.  You will need to take a shuttle bus to this building which is a short ride away.  This is sort ofinconvenient if you have a lot of luggage but they will help you if you require it.  The car rental building is also big with multiple floors depending on which car rental agency you are with you may have to go to another floor.  The building is spacious and you guessed it, they have slot machines there too.  You are in Las Vegas, you cannot really avoid seeing gambling related things!  . . You must return the car back to this facility upon the end of your rental again you will be bused over to the terminal where they will drop you off according to your airlines etc.. . This airport is very close to the strip but not close enough that you'd want to walk to your hotel.  The monorail only starts at the MGM at the south end so really your options are cabbing or shuttles or rental etc.  Hotels on the strip pretty much all have free parking so that's not really an issue.  . . Free wifi available everywhere as well...
LAS is the only way into Vegas without a very long boring drive.   Since it has a monopoly, they need not be very friendly at the airport and sometimes it's a bit of a letdown !!!  But if its on the way in, you don't have to go through security and your about to be whoowed with the spectacle !!!  And on the way out if you win, you could care less !!!  Now all you need to do is be lucky and WIN. !!!
The choices of good quality and reasonably priced food vendors here are atrocious!  Totally bummed
After all the years of renovations, I couldn't tell after being away for 7 years, it seemed almost the same dingy, stinky airport. Don't get me wrong, it's perfect for Las Vegas, there's a cluster of people everywhere, slot machines, smokers who can't smoke and angst filled tourists who just lost all their money. It stinks! . . However, I do like the walk when you get through the terminals when you arrive in Las Vegas. That part its dreamy!
We were picking up and security made us move.  We just got there and our person was 20 feet from the car.  I'd say they the most unfriendly of the many airports I have used. I understand that there is no waiting,  but when someone is 20 feet away,  it is not waiting.  It is picking up.  Perhaps and accessible cell phone lot would be helpful.  Not an poorly make garage that only allows 15 min until you are forced to pay 3 bucks just to pick up.
I've never been to Las Vegas before in my life, and with all the hype around this city, I really expected a little bit more then what I saw during my two layover's here recently.  For as much traffic as this place gets, I had higher hopes.  That's not to say that my experiences here were bad, but I wasn't impressed overall.. . VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!!!  Ok, now that I have THAT out of the way, let me tell you how my time here went..... . For starters, I few southwest, so I came in and out of the same terminal both times. The second time I was here, I noticed that they are building (or have built) another terminal.  Interesting.. . Onfirst impressions, I thought "wow, this place is kind of small compared to other places I have been" and totally not what I was expecting for Las Vegas. Phoenix's airport is 10 times bigger, cleaner and has a ton more restaurants' then this!  Even Detroit's new airport is bigger!  pfft.. . There were some places to shop at, but the airport seemed to be overloaded with slot machines.  I've heard about this before, but still thought it was kind of cool to actually see in person.  I could even see them from the airplane once we pulled into the gate!  The downside?  Lack of seating while waiting for your gate!  I would have rather had a few more seats if you ask me, and for as busy at this place is, I would have liked some additional chairs!  So many people here!. . They had a few places to eat in here, but again, I didn't see many places to sit. The terminal was long and skinny, and I didn't have enough time to wander and study the whole thing.  I love that I was able to get off and go right into the smoking lounge without having to buy a drink. It's literally right between gates C6 and C8.  Awesome!  Slot machines in there too!. . The staff I interacted with were friendly, outgoing and what I would expect for Las Vegas. Not uptight, but not overly laid back either.  Definitely fun, that's for sure!  . . This airport isn't bad, and serves it's purpose. Hey, I've seen some smaller crazier airports in my day, but really I wish they would step up their game a little bit. How about if instead of 900 commercials everyday about visiting Las Vegas, you pump it up at the airport? . . If I come here again I might rate it higher, but for now, a solid three stars.
McCarran is a perfectly fine airport for Las Vegas. It's close to the strip, there are always plenty of taxis, and if you get stuck waiting on a flight, there's free WiFi. Also, it's clean, with plenty of food and beverage options. I prefer the Delta terminal over the Southwest one, mostly because Delta's seems more open, with more upscale amenities.  SW can get overcrowded and a little ripe from time to time. . . Hate the taxi lines at Terminal 1? Do yourself a favor and take the train to Terminal 3, where the International flights arrive. As long as you don't need to go to baggage claim, and there hasn't been a rush of foreign arrivals, the taxi line is practically nonexistent. I was off the plane and at my hotel less than an hour from landing.
This airport to me is great. Its the first airport that I have been to that everyone is nice and helpful. The parking is very confusing.... So many different areas to park and lots of walking(of course its a airport). Bars and slot machines and coffee stands to pass the time! Everything is clean and and lines go fast every time I have been. All in all great airport!
Tsa employees were supremely unhelpful in figuring out where to go. The machine also told me a different gate than the ticket it printed out. When I got to gate c security the tsa agent insisted that I was at fault even though I was just remarking it must have told me something different. Additionally when i asked her how to get to gate d, she said it was a long walk either going through security at c or walking around to d. Short story, it was significantly faster to get to d through c security. Literally a three minute walk. Shout out to agent Tordillo for being really helpful.
I'm definitely a fan of this airport. . . I love how it's so close to downtown Las Vegas and getting to the strip is never a fuss.  I also like how the terminals are fairly big and that there are plenty of food and shopping options in addition to the obligatory slot machines.  For the most part security screenings here have been pretty smooth and go by fairly quickly compared to many other major airports.. . While I'm not a huge fan of taking a tram to the gates, it's actually not a painful process and the trains come right on cue every few minutes.  . . In terms of arrivals, the baggage claim area is huge and it's easy to get to your ground transportation needs.  There's also always a lot of taxis around, which helps a lot.  The buses to the rental cars also come fairly regularly so that's another bonus.  . . All in all this is definitely one of the better airports in the country.
Listen, it's 2014, the 21st century; every airport in America has free wifi. How does this airport that is in Vegas(which btw, looks like the lost city of el dorado from up above at night)not have any wifi??? What a conundrum. Another airport without vegan options, another layover starving while eating cliff bars. Word. Quick edit, there is wifi, it was hard to find.
Appearance. Vegas airport was very clean inside.   I arrived at 1pm for a 2pm flight and arrive to my airplane with 20min to spare.  Give yourself enough time because this place get busy. After passing security you also may need to take a tram to another part of the airport. Security lines were very long     .   .  For a busy airport it was relatively quiet.  Maybe most ppl were hungover?   I also never saw slots inside a airport terminal but seeing how this is vegas... I shouldn't have been surprised..                                        . Staff.. . They were courteous and friendly.
The Flying Port of entry for the Land of Lost Wages! Las Vegas Airport has improved over the years.. . Upon Landing you will be greeted with Slot Machines! I once saw someone win lots of $$$ while waiting for their flight!. . Check out the next time you book a flight to Las Vegas, try to find an Airline that flies in & out of Terminal 3 because its the best!    . . Alaska Airlines Operation is very nice in this New Terminal 3!. The TSA Security lines are efficient and food options are decent.  . . Good Luck Have Fun!. Viva Las Vegas!
The Southwest portion of the airport was a bit on the 'dated' side. Recharging stations are in short supply, if not, non-existent. Understandable, considering all the electricity that was being diverted to the slot machines. On the positive side, the gate agents were cool.
Clean and lives up to all expectations with slot machines and plenty of Frank Sinatra playing at the various shops and restaurants.. . Give yourself some time when checking out. You need to take a tram to most gates.. . TSA here is always efficient and bizarrely friendly. Must be all the slots :).
This airport is pretty big....but doesnt seem like it....when I landed I liked the fact that I could go straight to the slot machines...lol. but I needed to get my luggage....(first things first). The other half of my party landed flew United which was in a totally different terminal...and I had to catch a shuttle to get there....it was difficult to find because the staff were not that friendly....so this guy with an attitude gave me rude instructions ...thank goodness I had my listening ear on because he said it super fast. ....good thing is that my bags were at the baggage claim fairly quickly.  When I left...on my way back home ...I felt as though I was in the hottest terminal ever....Idk if it was hot due to all of the people or what but I have never been in a stuffy airport. ....TSA were fast, effecient and friendly.
Nice in and out airport-4 stars for not letting you pick up passengers curb side-reserved for taxis and car rental companies only. Your passenger has to go up one level, and you either have to park in short term or circle around. Parking staff was polite, and gave helpful information to get you back to the strip.
Always when you fly in or out from Las Vegas you can trust that those guys will handle it. Over 40 million passenger a year requires an organization smooth as a perfectly ticking swiss clockwork. Checkin and luggage claim will be fast, and wont waste your precious time here in wonderland.. . This is the place where you begin your adventure in the crazy vegas and most probably(read hopefully) also end your trip. However leaving the airport is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. And when you wanna transfer from airport, go by shuttle, cab or limo to the city, but make sure they dont go freeway unless you are going downtown off rush hours. . . Even if you dont want to, you will have to leave eventually, and when you do, the last thing you will get reminded about is the classic phrase.. . What happens in vegas, stays in vegas...
Specifically the Southwest terminal is pretty terrible when it comes to food choices on a layover. There are some pretty cool views of the strip as you fly in but in terms of airport amenities..... Just pass right on through
This airport is pretty simple to find your way around, that's a major plus. The art here is super nice to look at, takes your mind off of any stresses pre- or post flight. (I believe, that they have a huge wooden airplane above some escalators which looks awesome.) The slot machines are jarring at first, but you definitely know that you're in Las Vegas! They are in the middle or median of these huge walkways and behind glass barricades. They are loud. But, that's all a part of the distraction. . . The biggest problem I have with this airport is their TSA. Really, just one TSA worker who was not professional when making off-handed comments to my wife about some adult content I had in MY bag. It's Las Vegas, come on!! The SeaTac TSA kept their professionalism on point and never made me feel uncomfortable, once. I cannot say the same for the Vegas TSA. . . I really like this airport, but I do not feel comfortable with the TSA workers. Getting better employees would make this airport better. Left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Not very many nice restaurants at the terminal I was at. Slots are fun the whole place has that old casino staleness to it.  The car rental return is farther from the airport than the strip. So annoying to return your rental car and have to take a bus miles back to the airport.
I have visited Las Vegas more times than I would like. It's certainly not a favorite destination, but I have to go there for work every now and then and fly through Las Vegas regularly on my way to parts West, so McCarran is a familiar stop for me. The terminal where Southwest's flights are is a mess. It's littered with gaming machines that get in the way of traffic flow. Seating for passengers in the terminal (aside from the seats at the games) is woefully limited making it difficult for business travelers to get much work accomplished. There are a fair number of food options, but nothing spectacular. Rental cars are housed in a central rental car facility accessible via shuttle. The shuttles come pretty regularly on both ends, so you don't have to give yourself an excessive amount of time when you return your car. Make sure you plug the address for the rental car facility (not the airport) into your GPS when returning your rental car.  If you don't, you might have difficulty finding it or may drive out of your way.
Any airport with slot machines is a party for me!. . But standard airport, huge that requires ton of walking. Airport is very clean with many restaurants and shops to choose from. I visit Vegas often and have nothing horrible to say. During my last travel (in April), I was informed by my roommate that it was snowing back home. It was spring and I was packed for Vegas, I had no jacket or sweatshirt. Because the airport has a lot to offer, I was able to prepare for my snowy travels home!
If you want to play the slots while waiting for you flight, well then, you can't beat LAS.. . But if you want a decent selection of decent eateries after security, or if you want lots of clean bathrooms McCarran leaves a lot to be desired.. . The taxi line out front is usually long, though it does move pretty quickly.  Allot 10 minutes if you're going to need a taxi.
I may be biased but this is my favorite airport. . . Being a Las Vegas local, I am very familiar with our airport. I find if convenient to pick people up (though it can be confusing before you know thelayout). . . Flying out of Macarran is always a breeze. I have rarely experienced a huge line at security and generally the lines move very quickly. There are tons of places to eat and shop once you get through security. . . This is an airport for people watchers. First of all people come to Las Vegas from all over the world so there are so many different types of people to look at. Secondly, in Las Vegas, people visiting tend to wear the most gaudy, tiny, see through, sequin covered, outfit. Words like age and weather appropriate go out the window. They then pair said outfit with the craziest and often highest heels they own which makes for an excellent show. Lastly, inhibitions are abandoned and, most likely, they've been drinking since they boarded their plane to Vegas. Therefore you are left with people of every color of the rainbow, running around drunk looking like they got dressed in a cross between Liberace and Cher's closet. All of this equates to the best people watching experience you will ever have. . . Finally, this airport has something that I've never seen in any other airport, slot machines.  So if the shopping and people watching isn't keeping you entertained, and you haven't already lost your life savings, you can pull up a seat and try your luck at some last minute winnings. . . If you are flying into Las Vegas, our baggage claim area is huge and very efficient. You won't have to wait long for a bag. Ground Transportation is also pretty simple. The taxi line may look forever long but it's lightening quick.  Most importantly, our airport sits right next to the fabulous Las Vegas strip so the ride to your hotel should be short. . . Good luck while visiting!
Ooolala, Vegas. There are slot machines located inside of your airport terminals - what more can you ask for? The airport is huge, clean and TSA is surprisingly very nice. Is this a dream? Only issue is, you will probably melt on the super long cab line that awaits you after you pick up your luggage. The good news? Every casino on this strip is just a 5 min ride from this awesome airport.
Best airport wifi of any airport I've been to! It's hardly crowded, but the taxi lines can get ridiculous -- they move fairly quickly, though.
McCarran airport is the worst.  It's 4:30 am with only 3 lanes open at the security check point. Unacceptable!  TSA truly stands for Thousands Standing Around!  They Also love to Take S#1+ Away.
