Rooms look nothing like the photos that they have online. There are no refrigerators (have to request one). The best part about this hotel is the location, because it's in the middle of the strip. The room was decent, but I've stayed in better. . . The valet people weren't very friendly, didn't seem to be very happy in the heat!
Okay you get the full 5 stars now because you have CHIPOTLE in here finally!!! I feel like that chipotle coming soon was up there for over a year, but now that it's finally open...I'm definitely getting that over earls any day! You rock ph
Worst customer service EVER received at a hotel especially in Las Vegas since you have your choice of ANY hotel on the strip. Unfortunately I did not choose that hotel we were with a large group and someone else booked it. . . We got to the hotel late that evening waited in a long line as the check in staff conversed with the customers for LONG periods of time, We waited patiently our turn... as the customer walks away the staff continue to talk amongst themselves as we wait to check in for approx 20 minutes!. .  We had booked a suite with  2 king sized beds and of course they claim they sold the room which we reserved and PAID for months earlier. Getting NOWHERE for another 10 minutesthey claim NO ROOMS available. How does that happen?? We had PAID for a room with 2 king sized beds and NOW they only have a room with one bed for 2 of us to SHARE!. . Anyway, the (boy) that's what he looked like with his shirt too big and his pants too long wasn't budging So, we requested a manager and low and behold a room POPPED up with 2 king sized beds! . . I don't have any clue as to why they were doing what they did?? The hotel was too young of a crowd and the staff looked like a bunch of young kids running it... Since when did Las Vegas become so unaccomadating?? . . If looking for a GREAT time don't stay at Planet Hollywood! Just say'n....
First time staying here. I've stayed in numerous other strip hotels, and this isn't the best nor the worst. They upgraded us at the front desk at no charge, which was great. Extra 100sq ft, his and her sinks. Not to mention the room was covered in Steven Seagal memorabilia! Sold for me! Customer service was top shelf from Valet to checkout. Wifi is FREE for up to two devices (after you pay resort fees) also, great view of the strip. . . . . . The casino, lobby situation can be a little overwhelming at first. But once you use landmarks to remember how you get around, you'll be good. Our landmark was the Britney wheel to get back to the hotel lobby. Minor complaint about the rumor, and I do mean minor! The shower took about 8-10minutes to get remotely warm. . . We also ordered room service. Wasn't terrible. We ordered the Sunset Strips and Chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. Waiter was very nice and knew both my name and my wife's when he came in. . . Overall, I love staying here because of the customer service and PH central location on the Strip. And also the Total Rewards program covers all Caesars properties!
This is one of my favorite hotels to stay in. The location is great. Most importantly it has a good vibe (for me). It's more lively than most vegas hotel during the night. They have a large shopping area in the hotel which is convenient. The rooms are clean and modern. It's a good hotel choice for the younger crowd. I go to Vegas 7-8 times a year and I stay at PH most of the time
This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Resort. The non-smoking floor that we were on constantly had others that were smoking. When I notified the manager, they we re not concerned at all. Also, the night we arrived, our shower drain was not working. We had to wait over an hour (this was around 1 am after we had been traveling all day) for someone to come up and fix the drain so we could shower and go to bed. We also had issues with our credit card being charged incorrectly, after we had already paid our bill in full. Guest service was horrendous.  I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone.
In short .... . What I like:. - Nicely appointed, modern-feel to the casino.  Nice to see them ditch the old Aladdin theme.. - Really high-energy feel to the place, despite the dim lighting.. - Young vibe.  Nice up to date slot machines.. - Nice shopping area.  Glad to see they kept the old Aladdin shopping area featuring pretty reasonably priced goods.. - Lower end but fun food options like Pink's Hot Dogs and Cabo Wabo.. - Good location on the strip, right near the Paris, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.. . What I don't like:. - Basic rooms feel kind of small for some reason.. - Party vibe to the place also means it can get really noisy depending on who's staying near you.. - Not a huge fan of the shows featured here, and Brittany Spears?. - Traffic is shit around here. - Buffet is meh
Checkin was fast. The room was nice, floor was dirty-ish I brought a pair of socks to walk around in the room. Awesome having ABC stores and Walgreens for cheap bottled water and beer. Great central location. Pretty casino. Ate at planet dailies, earl of sandwich, Burgr and PBR Rock bar. Oh and hot pretzels with cheese in the mall. Loved having a mall where I sleep! Great place to stay in vegas!
This place is hotel hell. Checked in to a dirty room. Took hours for housekeeping to come up and do anything at all. When housekeeping was doing the job they should have done before we got there, I could here her radio buzzing with TONS OF other guests checking into dirty rooms. . Customer service SUCKS, they didn't give a crap our room was dirty and had clothes left behind from previous guests. . One morning, I woke up to go to the bathroom and the lights didn't work at all! . The air quality is this casino is literally the worst on the strip. Stay ANYWHERE else. Anything is better than this crap hole.
Planet Hollywood in my opinion is a VERY underrated casino!  It's new, it's fab and it has some cool choices for food and fun!!  I loved Gorden Ramsey Burger, the food was amazing!  I have seen other names in the past I recognize associated with this casino and the colors inside are bright, fun and it keeps you awake during the long Vegas night!  I would consider staying here and I definitely will be back to check out more of what PH has to offer!!
I totally love the feel of this place all around. I never win anything on the slots and it feels like I'm just throwing my money away each time I play on the slots, but I love the way this place looks inside and out. I've had bachelor parties out here and had a blast each time. I love how they blast their music and have those gogo dancers out on the weekends. The pool area is always nice and has plenty of people around to mingle with. This is one of my favorite hotel and casinos on the strip!
: My personal favorite is the Guess Store...supah cheap and love their Guess Woman Watches..hotel rooms ? 5 stars..Condo style. I love it! :)
I wouldn't recommend Planet Hollywood. The rooms are very expensive for what is available. We checked in and there were dirty, wet pillow covers on the desk, the bathroom door knob kept falling off, and the room smelt musty. I called the front desk and they stated they'd follow up with me after the room was serviced again. It took several hours for three different people to show up and fix the issue. The front desk never followed up. Spend your money elsewhere!
Shower has mold, pool service sucks no one at pool and none of cabanas being used.  None of the cabanas were never occupied and I sat in one of the chairs to place my stuff on their while I got into the spa and was asked to move and put my belongings on the floor.  I complained to manger in lobby which was no help.  They should be open, especially on slow months.  How hard would it have been to just tell me that if someone rents it out I would have to move which would not have been a problem for me.
Hmmm booked a room through "Hotels.com" with a  "Strip View". . . First of all, the room did not look anything from the pic. . . It was smaller...that's totally fine, but the view ... Seriously?! From the picture it looked like a two window view, but turned out to be a single window...as if that's not bad enough. . . The view was a totally crap. Bad angle. I mean, yeah, it's the Strip View, but has a bad angle and I paid nearly $50 more for the view. . . And worst of all, "Self Parking Garage" is not CONNECTED to their hotel. We had to walk to the Casino. Took us ten minutes or a lil more. We parked on the 3rd floor and walked to PH. Unless you valet.
Stayed here one Saturday night ...it was so cozy I felt at home...till I woke up to the beautiful view! Went downstairs and had breakfast and my friend got me a car service home which was a breeze right in valet and it was a really nice night!  I would totally totally stay here again plus I love Planet Hollywood!!
Best thing about this hotel is that Earl of Sandwich is downstairs!  This hotel also houses the Miracle Mile Shops so you have easy access to Fat Tuesdays and affordable shopping (H&M, Billabong, an ABC store) if you stay at his hotel.. . As for the rooms, it is just your standard hotel room decorated with movie memorabilia from popular movies.  We liked our very spacious bathroom though.  Shower and hot tub, and lots of sink space.  Unlike the former PH Towers (now called Elara), there are not many outlets for charging your electronics (seems like a MUST these days living the smart phone/ipad/kindle/tablet age).. . For casino, since Britney does her shows here, they do a lot of promoting and play a lot of Britney's songs in the casino.  They also have a pleasure pit for some of the card games.  Dancers will come out at night in the pit.. . Not much to complain about this hotel so I wouldn't mind staying here again. The sleeping rooms alone are 3 stars but I'm bumping it to 4 because of all the easy access to shopping and Earls downstairs.
