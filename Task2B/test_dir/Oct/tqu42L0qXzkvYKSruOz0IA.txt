Imagine waking into a Denny's but instead of trying to win an ugly stuffed animal from a grabber game, you can play cheap craps and blackjack. What's even better is the food. I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. Also, got a side order of pancakes. I ordered the corn beef hash extra crispy. If you prefer crispy textures, order the hash this way. Everything was good, if not really good. The corn beef hash had great flavor and appropriate seasoning (not too salty). The breakfast potatoes were good with a nice crispy pop with each bite. I also was impressed with the pancakes, mostly with the texture. Nice and crispy on the outside and light fluffiness in the outside. . . An overall great value for food you can eat anytime of the day. Plus, if you're down on your vegas strip, Ellis island is the place to go because it's cheap and where you can overcome your wallows with hit the spot kinda of food.
So while the prices is reasonable the service sucks. We waited 30mins just to get our drink order. After tasting the soup and the NY steak it was worth the wait, but come on this is vegas. People are always coming and going you should have a fast wait staff. I wouldn't have yelped this, but after 4 other people after us got seated and served that's just wrong.
We use to come with all our friends for their steak special but we were really disappointed the last few times we came.  Never mind the service is slow, the food was not worth the wait.
Great ribs, great beer, decent slots. We haven't stayed there but every time were in town we get the ribs and a beer. Not overpriced and very messy but delicious.
Steak and eggs that come with two slices of toast and potatoes for just $5.99?! Um, hell yeah. So yeah, they cooked my steak medium when I asked my medium rare but after a night of clubbing and drinking I cannot complain. And did I say that it was $5.99?
We wanted to check this place out for Oktoberfest and it was freaking awesome. Unlimited beer, a mug and a shirt for $10 that lasted from 5pm-10pm. We also got dinner for $9.99 and it included apple cobbler. Monica at the bar was great. I don't know how she didn't lose her mind being the only bartender in the karaoke area. They also had a few contests going on like pretzel eating and stein holding. Great night for $20!. . Also, Yelp was there giving out free stuff and taking pictures. Nate and Tiffany were great!
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #13:. the hotel for this joint is the next door Super 8, so that should tell you a lot right there; it is old-school, semi-smoky, and very small; you can walk around the perimeter in 5 minutes (if you're walking slow!); very little to recommend this place except 2 things: eating & drinking!; the Cafe specials are legendary, and they also have a Metro Pizza outlet which is basically just a counter and some tables, but it's hard to beat their quality vs. price ratio on pizzas & strombolis; best of all, they make their own beer here, and it's $2 per pint - yep, that is not a typo - you give the bartender a $10 bill, and he gives you a full pint of amber, stout, pale ale, or whatever, plus $8 of change - it's crazy!; best craft beer bet = well, "craft" beer might be a slight stretch, but they only serve their own homemade juice, and it sure beats macro-beer Bud/Coors/Miller swill; did I mention it's only $2 per pint?
Good food, great beer all at reasonable prices!. During NFL games 20oz  craft beer $1.
Very good beer and Barbeque. This casino feels like home to me. Just walk behind Balleys and its right there. . I'm coming back Ellis Island  Casino & Brewery.
This is a great little hidden gem. Tons of really good beers on tap and cheap, yet delicious, grub. And if you read this in time, definitely make the trip for the Oktoberfest $10 unlimited beer mugs (and get properly tanked), and then stay for the most amazing karaoke you'll possibly ever hear.
Sooo while on the Linq Ferris wheel this couple told us to eat here.... They said it looks like shit on the outside lol but the food is great.... So of course we are going to try it out..... WELL DAMMIT!!! The food is GREAT!!! And Cheap Cheap Cheap!!! Serious this is a im on my last 5.00 from gambling my wages away in Vegas.... I ordered the Chorizo burrito... It had of course Chorizo, Bacon, Eggs, Cheese a side of potatoes a juicy pepper and guacamole and sour cream.... There's no picture because I ate my food to fast so I'm sorry   my Mister has the Veggie omelet with potatoes and wheat toast... The omelet had cheese, mushrooms, peppers, onions, spinach, and tomatoes.... Again!!! The food is SUPER GOOD!!! This is actually the best and cheapest meal we ate in Vegas and THE BEST!!!! We even won on the craps table and our spicy bloody Mary's were just that SPICY AND DELISH!!!! Don't leave Vegas without stopping here at least once OH and they are 24hours so from 11-6am they have 3.99 two eggs plate!!! You can't beat that with a bat!!!!
There's only one reason I come here & it's for the cafe inside. I've never stayed on property over night & I've never had any luck gambling here. My steak dinner that should have been under $10 a person suddenly becomes $310! The machines hate me here :(. Anyway it's a little dive property but it's always busy so plenty of people obviously love it. The funniest moment is when you're having dinner & suddenly you here someone singing karaoke that shouldn't be :). That never gets old!. The atmosphere is fun & even though it could use some TLC it's still a fun place.
I only come here for two things since I do not gamble or have never needed to stay here. One is the Cafe. Two is the Karaoke Bar. That being said, this place is awesome if you want to get away from the strip but do not want to travel too far. The old establishment looks a bit run down considering strip standards but hidden inside is an oasis of craziness that one would expect from Vegas locals.. . The Cafe is a great place to catch a decent meal for a good price. I would definitely recommend their steak special which isn't advertised on the menu and is priced very cheap. I can't remember the price as it sits now, but it used to be 6.99 and I hear the price has risen due to the increased popularity of this "secret" order. Anywho, its cheap its edible and will fill you up. Don't expect it to be within "Flemings" steak house standards but it'll get the job done. It comes with soup or salad, a side of vegetables, your choice of carbs (mashed potatoes, baked potato, rice, fries, etc.), an in house brewed beer or root beer, and of course the freaking steak. Sit down, eat, and enjoy the sounds of people singing karaoke next door. Often times you'll hear some great voices, some not so great voices, and some people that sound like two dying cats.. Which moves on to favorite part number two of this place.... . The Karaoke Bar!!! What can I say it's a public Karaoke spot on stage with DJ and a bar. What's not to love. Drinks are priced well enough in order to get your dose of liquid courage before you embarrass yourself on the front stage before everyone else. Don't worry there are a lot of people who are going to embarrass themselves so you won't be the only one. The crowd is amazing and friendly and everyone is there to have a great time. So go! Sing your heart out and hang out with the rowdy degenerate people of Las Vegas!!!
Juicy BBQ, tasty beer, friendly service, and great price.. . On the other hand, the coffee shop is just average. Food is OK, service ....not so great.. . Well, nobody is perfect.
If you are questioning whether or not going to this place, just go already!! We had a large group and found on Yelp. Everyone of our group was raving about how much fun they had, how good the food was, fun dealers at the tables and cheap craft beer! What more is there?  Great DJ and funky music too.  Fun Fun Fun!! Karaoke at the end of the night was awesome for some of our group who stayed!. . This place is a blast!! Amazing value! Refreshing change from the strip.
We ate 10pm which is late, however service takes forever. It took about an hour for the food to come. They also have a steak special but you have to sign up for a card which takes a while. The steak dinner comes with string beans, potato and a beer. It tastes pretty good and standard, not bad for $9 in Vegas. The small casino/brewery isn't ritzy but has a lot of character.. . However, just expect to wait a long while late at night!
We came into town and wanted to go get ribs.  We were going to go to a chain but looked at the yelp reviews and decided to ask around instead.  Our concierge suggested Ellis Island.  Boy, were we pleasantly surprised! Awesome ribs, beans and coleslaw.   We ordered full racks, took the leftovers home and enjoyed more ribs the next night!  The reason we only gave 4 stars was that the corn and bread was very tired.  The items that take the least amount of time to prepare were made too far in advanced and allowed to sit around thus we were served cold, hard bread and mushy, overcooked, bland corn on the cob. With that said, we will be back when we return to Vegas!
A Vegas trip won't be complete without some steak and eggs! I remember the days when these use to be $3.99, fast forward a few years...the steak and eggs are now $5.99. Just $2 more, but worth the price! If you go to Tuscany, their late night specials still include the steak and eggs for $3.99. . . My friend and I were on our way out of Vegas and decided to drop by. For a Sunday lunch, the wait time was 30 minutes. That's not a problem because we decided to hit up the slots! They will also give you a pager to notify you when your table is available.  If you open a new reward card with them, you'll get a chance to spin the wheel to see how much you'll get on free slot play. The range is $10 - $500, but I think everyone just gets $10. The machines are good for this small casino. They have some of the newer machines that you'd find on the strip. . . When we finally sat down, we placed our orders. I enjoyed my steak and eggs. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for $5.99. I also ordered some orange juice and coffee (the orange juice was awesome! freshly squeezed). Oddly, the price of the drinks was just the same as the steak and eggs, so my total was approximately $12 for the meal...not too shabby! . . Overall, I am giving this place 3 stars because it includes both the casino and restaurant. The place is off the strip, so it's attracting a different kind of crowd. Also, the casino was really dark. The restaurant offers good deals and that's probably the only reason why I'll come here again.
Love, love, love Ellis Island!  This is my favorite dive casino in Vegas.  Cheap & delicious eats, friendly dealers, and free drinks (as long as you're gambling) makes EI an almost every night ritual when visiting Vegas.  Expect to wait at least 30-60 minutes for a table.  No worries because there's slots or table games to keep you occupied until your pager goes off.  They have great BBQ and prime rib.  You can't beat the price either.  $8.99 for a sirloin dinner that includes potato, veggies, and salad.  This is my favorite place to eat, drink, and gamble in Vegas!
Awesome place! I had the shrimp scampi and was delicious! Super cheap and very good! Beer is Great! $2 can't be that on the strip! Amber ale house brew I recommend
You come to this locals spot for the beers and greasy diner.  There is a Metro Pizza joint that offers 2 for 1 whole pizzas on Sundays. . . . Place is decent
this review is mainly for the brewery. Hands down ... one day of the best breweries in town. Stout superb. The light beer so good and I made my conciction that consisted of lemon juice and tabasco sauce with the light beer. Btw, its only $2.75 for a pint abd their home made root beer is refreshing!. . Customer service i great. Fush n chips are good. Cocktail shrimps are huge.
Great place to eat due to a variety of items on the menu (breakfast/lunch/dinner) that taste good, open 24hrs, and always there for you.  I've lost count how many times I've eaten here.  I worked late hours and stayed in the area so about 0400 in the morning we would stop here and grab a bite to eat.  They have a bar, karaoke, casino, and of course, a restaurant that serves breakfast/lunch/dinner where all items are available on the menu regardless of the hour.  After work we could always count of this place to be waiting for us.  The steak and eggs and chicken Philly cheese steak were amazing, as was the french toast.
Service is slow as hell.  Had a waiter that kind of looked like Rick from Pawn Stars.  Took about 15 minutes before we were first greeted and then it was at least another 10-15 minutes until we could order.  The prime rib was excellent though.  Only thing that hurt my experience was the slow service.
Just a block off the Strip. Breakfast is delicious and very affordable. Our waitress, Rocio, was helpful & attentive. No wonder she was 2013's employee of the year!
Read many reviews on Ellis Island so we decided to go for the deals! Bf got the 10oz top sirloin & 20 oz beer for $8.99. . I got the 8oz ny strip & 5 shrimp for $11.99.. The food is actually quite good!! Deals are amazing!! Service was very good, it wasn't too too busy. Small casino, looks like it's more popular for the locals. . Can't wait to come back on my next trip in town!
We went on a night when they were "cleaning the kitchen" so the waitress apologized in advance that service could be slow.  But man did we wait a long time.  We passed the time by drinking beer, watching the only waiter (an old Vietnamese man) hobble around the restaurant, and wondering if this happens every time the kitchen gets cleaned.  Other than that it was refreshing to find some good food at an affordable price (especially after I lost a lot of money that day).  But the tall beers they were serving at Ellis Island made me forget all about that : )
