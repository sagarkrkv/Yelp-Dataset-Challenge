Ordered the biscuits and truffled egg sandwich. Delicious. Nice open kitchen and clean. Bring coins to park meters only.. . Try it you'll like it
My wife loves this place and it seems like other people do too! I didn't see what the hype was all about.. . We were trying to get a table for 10. After a long wait (because it was extremely busy) we were taken outside in the patio. Well, the table didn't fit 10. The waitress simply didn't know how to count chairs. We had to wait again (15+ min) to get seated inside. . After our meal, it took our waitress sooooo long to get our checks and to get us out.. . I ordered pancakes, and sure there's not much to it but they were on the dry side. I had to drown them in syrup. . . This place wasn't bad but definitely hyped up. I'll try it again and order something different and hopefully the service gets better.
Excellent taste and savory menu.  My favorite is the pancake.  Crunchy on the outside and soft and most inside.
I love this place. Eat here, please. Help Keep this business live and thriving.
We wanted to love Eat. Went for lunch today, 20 min wait for a table, another 10 minute wait for someone to take our drink order, another 10 mins for the waitress to come back and take our lunch order, another 15 mins for our food to arrive.... all of our soup was cold and so salty I could not stomach it, my grilled cheese was far from killer, it too was cold. Waitress never came back to check on us. Four members of the staff including the manager walked by our table, without a word... when the waitress did return with the check I told her we did not like our food, she offered to get us something else.... at this point sitting there for over an hour we declined. The manager did then come to our table and said lunch was on him. Very disappointing. Cute place, really bad service, food not so good :( We will not be returning.
Saxby and I ate lunch here today with some friends after trip to the Children's Discovery Museum. The food was ok but nothing really stood out to make me want to return. I shared the B.L.A.T. and the Shrimp Po Boy with the other adult we were dining with. Both came with a side of potato salad. When I think of a Po Boy I imagine a subroll bursting with fried shrimp shredded lettuce and tomato finished with delicious aioli. This "Po Boy" was on a ciabatta with sauteed shrimp, lettuce, tomato, bread and butter pickles and sriracha mayo. It was fine but I'll be heading over to Lola's soon to satisfy my Po Boy craving.. The B.L.A.T. was good. . The best thing on the all of the plates was the pickle. It was a great pickle. . The boys had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The sandwiches were good but the soup was not good at all. It was so overwhelmed by garlic that I can still taste it now, hours after I had just a few bites. That brings me to my main complaint. They don't accommodate kids in any way. The drinks for the two four year olds were served in 16oz glass pint glasses, There is no kids menu and there's really not much on the lunch menu that kids would like except the grilled cheese and I've already talked about the soup that's served with it. My son isn't picky but he's also not adventurous either. He's a normal 4 year old.. Perhaps I might return for breakfast but I think there are better choices in the area for lunch.. (burp, ugh garlic)
3.5/5. . We came for lunch on a weekday. Wasn't too busy but service was kinda slow. . . dwBLTa - smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, with chipotle mayo on a toasted sourdough. Bread was buttery and soft, bacon crisp and thick, but couldn't really taste the chipotle mayo. Potato salad was meh. . . . Roast Beef - blue cheese, wild mushrooms, picked red onions, arugula, with mayo on ciabatta. Roast beef was tender and moist. The mushrooms were a great addition and added a nice sweetness. The bread was soft and warm. Satisfying sandwich. The fresh-still-warm potato chips were fantastic.
I went here today for a lunch meeting today and all I have to say is YUM! I had the veggie burger without a bun and the tomato salad on the side. My colleague got the killer grilled cheese with avocado and enjoyed every bite! . . Everything was super fresh and delish! I highly recommend trying this place out.
I had high hopes for Eat., but alas these hopes were dashed. . . I came here on a Sunday morning during normal busy brunching hours. I get it, it's a popular time to eat, but I what I don't get is waiting 25 minutes to seated then having to wait another 10 minutes before we even get to meet out server for the morning. Thirty five minutes in total waiting and all I have received is a cup of water and some coffee. Personally, I would avoid Eat. on Sundays for brunch, because this place gets packed!. . I suggested this place to some friends and family after reading a few Eat's reviews, for the most part they have good reviews with a few minor hiccups along the way. We arrived and after studying the menu for the past half hour we were finally able to sit down. The hostess took us to our table and almost immediately we were greeted with waters and a notification that out server would be right back to help us... fast forward to us looking at the menu for the 7th time and wondering when/if our bellies would ever get full on this beautiful Sunday morning, out of nowhere our server finally appears pen and paper in hand. After a few quick menu questions and our table having to explain to our server what a Frittata is, our food order was put in and breakfast was on it's way. . . FOOD TIME:. As a group we ordered the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. These were ok, the cinnamon flavor was lacking and the biscuit fell apart at every turn, but the compote was quite delicious and I found myself going back for more.  .  . I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. First off this had a beautiful presentation, the way the food was laid on the plate was fantastic and really made me want to dive right in. This order comes with two huge bacon strips, two over medium eggs, two fairly large butterflied shrimp, all placed on a mound of grits. This meal was ok, it had good flavor, but needed a just a kick of spice on the back end. Also it arrived cold. Which I thought was weird because I was the last person at our table to get my food. . . During our meal a few things were definitely noted... . . - Our server was M.I.A., we didn't see her again until the check was dropped. . - The server or food runner forgot to bring out one of our diners toast. Since our server had disappeared. We asked the hostess for assistance and she quickly delivered the toast. . - Our table was also lacking condiments; ketchup, salsa, and tabasco. After a few attempts get to someone's attention, my GF's mom got up and went into the kitchen and asked for the missing items herself. . - Our waters were filled only once the entire time we ate. I'm not looking for a running river here, but a refresher of the water glasses would be nice. . . I really wanted to like this place. It has a great ambiance and decor, but when the food and the customer service are not a in fully symbiotic relationship other things tend to follow suit. . . EAT. is NOT A-Ok, but just ok. I believe in second chances so I will be back, but I will be avoiding the Sunday brunch crowd.
Cute, hipster joint to grab breakfast, brunch, or lunch. I came here for a Sunday brunch. We found parking on the side streets right away. There are other available parking spots nearby. There was a little wait, 25-30 minutes which was expected since it was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show.. . Got the cinnamon biscuits in strawberry compote for an appetizer for four people. Our group ordered poached eggs over corned beef hash, Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon, shrimp & grits, & your basic American breakfast-eggs, bacon, toast, & pancakes. Our appetizer-I barely tasted any cinnamon. The biscuits were OK but thought the strawberry compote would be paired better with something else. However, the compote was refreshing and good. After having a sample of everyone's dishes, I like the shrimp and grits the best and the fluffy pancakes the second. I did not like the Eggs Benedict (who invented turkey bacon?) and my corned beef was not that great.. . I thought the plates all had a beautiful presentation but many of the flavors did not come together for me. There were other items I would love to try but after sampling several dishes, I'm not in a hurry to come back here but not opposed to it if someone wanted to come here.. . Service was good and we were constantly checked on but felt like they were trying to hurry us for the next table. Good for people waiting. I'm not one to linger after I finish eating so it wasn't a big deal.
Been here several times for lunch and its a solid triple with one man on!   I always walk away happy.  Got great sandwiches, soups and breakfast and lunch is the specialty, with a hip downtown flair.  Need a quick meeting with a business lunch, get there EARLY to get a seat, there is a wait sometimes, but not long.   Also, weekends I am sure are slammed.   I go during the week for my trips and its a great hipster trip every time.   Solid grinds!
Really good food. Definitely recommend the pancakes and any of their egg dishes. A bit pricey in my opinion but great spot.
We found this place completely by accident. I had Yelped another restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas but when parking proved to be a bigger pain in the ass than it was worth, we just drove in the opposite direction. THEN we stumbled upon this gem. I was pleasantly surprised that as "hip" and "cool" as the setting and staff were that they were super friendly. I had my grandparents with me and truth be told, they hated the setting and felt a bit out of place but when the food came, their tune changed. I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and Tomato soup. Lovely flavor, would have preferred if it was actually hot though. I understand that restaurants get busy, but really? It's soup. Luckily, it was super tasty so I didn't stay annoyed for too long. But again, the staff was super friendly and were very speedy with recovery when part of my order managed to get lost. All around, the meal my family and I had here was pretty damn good. We all took turns trying each other's food. The chicken pozole was tasty, the corned beef with poached eggs was insane, the menus were short and to the point and it really is a beautiful setting in a kinda blah part of town. If you come here, you'll have a great meal and maybe you can flirt with the server with the amazing beard. (Seriously, he was so good looking it was distracting) I'll definitely be back. I'd love to meet the owner next time. From all that I've heard about her she seems pretty awesome. See you soon!
Truly a 'must dine' joint if you're lookin for bomb ass brunch in downtown Las Vegas (blocks away from Fremont Street). As a 1st timer, i knew i stumbled across a foodie's gem when i encountered the spillage of people waitin outside about 10'ish on a Sunday morning. . . I dined w/a friend so our wait was about 20 mins (not too bad considering the bigger the party, the longer the wait time). Service was great, ambience was hip & inviting & food was bangin! I ordered shrimp & grits - 13 dolla made me holla when i saw that my grits were happily submerged in a savory sauce beneath a pile of goodness (2 strips of smoked bacon, 2 eggs over easy, & shrimps topped w/pico de gallo). I left w/a smile & my belly left happy so I'll definitely be back! :D
Before starting a day of outlet shopping with the husband, we decided to grab brunch at Eat based on some helpful Yelp reviews. The staff was friendly yet they seemed like they can barely keep up with the customers. I asked our waitress for some recommendations but she didn't have much of an opinion other than the portions were large.. . We got our food and we sat for a bit realizing they forgot to bring us our utensils. I ordered the cinnamon biscuit with the strawberry compote. My husband felt like having their "killer grilled cheese" with some "kick-ass tomato soup." My dish was decent but unremarkable except that I couldn't taste any cinnamon at all. I felt that I may have punted and should have ordered the chicken fried steak despite the waitress thinking the portions might be too large for me. I tried my husband's grilled cheese. Frankly, I make a far superior grilled cheese. The bread was too thick and it seemed more like a cheese sandwich with melted cheese. I could give this place another go since we might not have ordered the right items. But in my opinion, if a place is going to name their dish "killer grilled cheese," they really need to back it up.
Really nice, homey ambience to the place, has very friendly and helpful staff w/ great service, and wait wasn't to bad on a Monday morning especially with the Life is Beautiful festival finishing up the night before. I ended up getting the truffled egg sandwich, my friend got the eggs benedict special they had going on, & we shared a short stack pancake. The truffled egg sandwich looked like it'd be a bit heavy, but the eggs were fluffy, bacon crispy, feta creamy w/ hints of truffle oil, & the skin of chive potatoes had a bit of a crunch that gave a good textural difference and made it a really good side. The pancakes we got were a pretty decent size with some powdered sugar on it. Surprisingly the pancakes had a bit of a crisp on the top layer and were almost cloud like w/o that heavy butter taste. If you're staying Downtown or just want a change in location for brunch I'd definitely recommend this place.
YUM and EAT. are the only 3 letter words you need for a successful brunch.  And eat. brings it all!  This was my 2nd visit to eat. during a recent trip to Vegas.  I went last year when I was in Vegas and I knew that I had to come back.  . . It is the perfect little hipster hole in the wall in an "up and coming" part of town.  They have a spacious, sun-shining interior and a beautiful little patio too.   They occasionally have live music on the weekends during brunch which makes it the ultimate hipster hangout if that's your thing.. . Let's get to the food... . . Cinnamon Biscuits - shared with the table after a recommendation from the bus boy.  Pretty tasty and definitely worth sharing.  Probably too sweet and rich for a meal on its own.    . . Truffle Egg Sandwich - my boyfriend had this but I stole a few bites and it was delicious!  Scrambled eggs, mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil on ciabatta.  Can't go wrong. . . BLTA - I had this sandwich on my first visit.  It's a great version of a BLT.  Add an egg to it for the perfect brunch dish.. . Greek yogurt - tasty and hearty portion with fresh berries and granola.  A little heavy on the granola and could have used some more yogurt to balance it out.  . . Service.... The service at eat. is great and we always end up with a server that is a little odd in all the right ways.  Very personable and chatty with random comments that add to the vibe
Totally Amazing experience!  Everything was delicious and filing.  We stopped by after the Neon Museum for lunch. The staff was gracious and courteous. I ordered the Ruben with their tomato salad. The best I've had in a long time! My wife went for the truffle egg sandwich - delicious!  Our friends both ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was better than what Mom ever made.. Portions were perfect! We all left full and satisfied. . Best off strip lunch and breakfast spot. Step away from the strip buffets (where everything tastes the same) and eat some real food! Can't go wrong!
