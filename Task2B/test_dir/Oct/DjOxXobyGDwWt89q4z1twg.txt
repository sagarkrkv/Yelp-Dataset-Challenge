I figure if you have a small menu you have to do it right... I tried the shoyu ramen... it was alright... nothing special... But i was super disappointed by the goyza... really bland... . the spot is great... super small and intimate..
Absolutely delicious, probably the best ramen that I've ever had.  If you don't like to wait on line for a table, stop by during the off hours.  Every time I've gone, the line was out the door, but that's an indication of their food.
Monta is my go to place all day, every day :). . The ramen is always great. (From tonkotsu to kuro...) you can't go wrong with any kind!!!!  Broth is always on point, and the chasu is bomb.  plus you can add/edit the toppings on your ramen. I like mine with nitamago (egg), and some shredded green onions (for texture) always, but there's plenty of options. . . The awesomeness doesn't stop with their ramen. The best dish ever is their pork belly bowl!!!!! It's super rich, with lots of heavenly pork. Garnish it with some ginger and sesame seeds. Yum! . . Service is always good. It's a pretty small place though. They tend to get really busy, and wait time can be long, but it is for sure worth the wait :)
As my first ramen experience it will be hard to compare.the place is tiny though so you might want to order it to go, as there are only a few tables. Either way it was wonderful. I choose to have the tonkotsu and the pork just melted in your mouth, yet it was still only the secondbest feature as the broth was amazing.
My boyfriend and I had to stop in again on our way to the airport.. Monta has awesome ramen. Also, I would recommend getting the spicy sauce on the side of you like a little extra flavor!!. . Warning** you will leave full.
There's love and hate relationship in this place. I love it cuz the food is good. I love the pork belly and the tonkostu ramen. The one thing I hate it it's the wait and small space. But everything else it good.
This place is by far my favorite Ramen place in Vegas!!! The prices are very cheap compared to other Ramen establishments here and the flavor is delicious!!!
I was craving ramen after going out in Downtown LV and found this place through Yelp. As an avid ramen eater, I would say this place was pretty good. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen, and I must say, I have had more flavorful broth but the noodles were a nice texture and the ratio of noodles to pork was fairly equal. . . I loved that this place was open late and although it was packed when I first arrived at 12:30am, I was seated within 15 minutes of arriving. I also enjoyed that they had all thecondiments already on the table, including the fresh ginger. I always ask for ginger and I'm glad this time I didn't have to! . . I am biased towards my ramen spot in Torrance, however I'm still a fan of this place. I would come back again!
We had to wait quite a while because this is a very small place, but it was worth it. We ordered Shoyu Ramen and Miso Ramen (x3), gyoza, and the kimchi fried rice. The kimchi fried rice was a total hit with our group, and everything else was good as well. The gyoza was nice and crispy. We will definitely be back but we will probably try to find out what their peak hours are so we don't have to wait as long next time.
3 stars for the food. 4 stars because it's pretty good for the price you pay; especially in Vegas where it's hard to find good, non-fast-food places that'll satisfy you for under $10. . . Shoyu Ramen ($6.95). Tonkatsu Ramen (6.95). Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75 for regular). . Ramen was good, had a great bite to it and soup wasn't too bad. IMO, I wouldn't say it was anything special though. Pork belly bowl was really yummy. Simple: meat and rice. I loved this. Portion was actually huge and I probably could have done with just the small bowl.
This is, hands down, the best ramen restaurant in Vegas, in my opinion.  . . The dining area itself is rather small, and more often than not you'll have to waitawhile for a table (especially during lunch on weekdays, and on weekends).  I think it would be super difficult for them to accommodate to a party of more than 4 people.  . . Their prices are very decent as well.  Everything is pretty much under $10.  Everything I have tried here tasted excellent.
You're lucky if there's no wait. So worth it tho!. I always get the shoyu ramen... and pork belly bowl! don't forget those add ons... I always add corn in my ramen!. I'm not a ramen person but if I have to eat ramen... I choose Monta!. Fast service too! Casual dining and cheap eats!. I'm a fan!. - Miss Yelp 2014
Look I'll keep it short.... Everyone on here raving about how good it is, and too be completely honest, it was pretty tasty. Fact is though, my wife and I have STILL only been in the US for less than 1 month.... Soooo the Japanese ramen of our home, which is Japan lol, still is heavy on our pallet. . Ok so I ENJOYED it. My wife said the soup (broth) was very good and very authentic. However, she had a problem with the noodles. She said the broth was real, the look was real, but it was kinda mind messing because the noodles were too soft for the kind she ordered. She used a bunch of Japanese words of course but I'm just giving the typical American consumer the gist. Taste is 3 stars, authenticity is 3-4 stars, seating is like wow, PACKED 24/7. Price was fine... I mean, my wife felt bad for being critical about a ramen place and her Japanese blood came out when she stared being thankful instead for even being able to have Japanese food in this American desert. Her final decision was, for a western country, this was pretty solid ramen. 3 stars! . So that's that. It's not the worst... And my American ass honestly doesn't know the one details and difference... So it's whatever.  Don't take my word for it... Thousands have reviewed this place. Do take my wife's word though... For America this is a 4 or 5 star... In reality (in Japan) this would be like a 2... Not the worst but in the homeland your ramen gotta be dope to compete. So this might sound harsh but just saying... OVERALL... It's worth it. If you can get in (always packed) please go in... If there's a long line (like out the door, which is common as this place is popular) walk catty corner to Curry Zen in same parking lot... Personally, Japanese curry is my FAV... But this is about Monta.... And Monta is a 3star ramen shop in the world... But closer to 5 stars a far as America goes. Cheap too... Good on a budget. 
Don't go here if you are vegetarian! Totally my bad on this one. My husband wanted ramen, so I looked up this place and saw the reviews were great. Didn't think to check the menu to see if it was vegetarian friendly, just wanted to get him soup to help with his cold. He LOVED his food, and everyone else's looked amazing. They did have a cold noodle that was vegetarian. It didn't taste bad, but wasn't great. couldn't get past the "cold" part. Felt like I was eating cold leftovers out of the fridge. Meat eaters however, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!
Came to Monta based upon word of mouth recommendations and was pleasantly relieved we made the right choice in coming to eat there. I had the Miso Ramen and the broth was a delivery of full body. It wasn't bland or too saltly or just average and so I was a happy camper. I had added the eggs and corn to my order. It was like a partyin my mouth. The pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were ideal.. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and a Ramen fix!
Wow. Just wow, in the worst way possible. Was it an OFF night or something for them the night that I decided to enjoy my first meal in Vegas when I landed?. . I've heard only amazing things about Monta Ramen from fellow online Yelpers. But lemme tell ya, I should have listened to my actual Yelp foodie friends from the Bay Area. They told me, "Monta ain't all that." . . Don't get me wrong, service was pretty good actually. Maybe too good...cuz my ramen came out within minutes of ordering. How is that even possible? Do they have it pre-made in the back and it's just microwaved or something?. . I had very high hopes for Monta, sadly...I will never return. Here are my reasons:. . 1. TOO SALTY. And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.. . 2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles. I like my ramen noodles thick and with the right kinda chew!. . 3. My soft boiled egg got cold within minutes. Hmmmm :-|. . 4. Spicy means weaksauce-American-spicy to them.. . 5. Oh yes, and there's always a wait here too. Why, I have no clue.... . Do yourself a favor. Go across the street to Ramen Sora and have a real bowl of delicious ramen. . . You can tell I was quite excited to sit down and enjoy my meal when I first got to Monta...check out my YouTube vlog for that weekend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
I only wish they have one in So Cal.  I had the Kuro and the broth is so rich and nothing I've tasted here. We have a lot of great ramen places here but nothing like Monta. The manager was also super nice and called us a cab. The wait was long but totally worth it.  The fried rice was also yummy! My new go to ramen spot when I'm in town.
Definitely a great place for ramen.. Had tried all of their ramen. My favorite would be the miso ramen. Place is small, but definitely has the Japanese ramen shop feel!. Pork belly bowl is a must!
Absolutely the best ramen I have ever had! I ordered the Shoyu ramen and every bite was delicious. I will definitely be coming here every time I am in Vegas! Priced very reasonably. The noodles were perfect and just absolutely mouth watering! New favorite Ramen place!
Ever since I started dating my boyfriend over a year ago, we've been coming here whenever we had the money to. We love this place so much we'd go multiple times a week if possible. We even considered staying in Vegas just because of it (we live in San Diego now.) This is hands down the best ramen place I've ever had.
Monta was our go-to ramen place while we were living in Vegas (especially after drinking)! Great ramen (especially Tonkotsu Shoyu) and gyoza! Can't wait to go back there when we come to Vegas!
I like to think I'm an average guy with an average guy appetite. My biggest gripe: portions wayyy too small ... with minimum protein. The two thin pork slices were yummy but about 1/3 fat and the size of a "dollar" pancake. Broth was very salty but I like salt. Heads up ... The thicker noodles were perfectly cooked (al dente). Veggies were yummy. Everyone around us was ordering extra-this or extra-that ... underscoring insufficient portion size. Taste was excellent. Tiny, noisy, cramped, long wait, rock music was totally unnecessary.
When I was in Vegas, I was craving Ramen!  I searched on yelp and was amazed by the raving reviews I read about this place.  The restaurant is really small, about 5-6 tables plus the bar, so we waited for about an hour in half to be seated.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and shared the pork belly bowl with my husband.  Their ramen soup wasn't as flavorable as I expected and same goes for their pork belly.  I felt like some ingredients was missing.  I'm sad to say that  I've had better.
My family always having dinner at this place almost every weeks. We love food here but last night it was the first time I feel disappointed for their service. There was a group of people about 8 of them sat on the waiting seat for customer and SMOKE. Not only one but 5 of them smoke.  Everytime the front door open smoke will come inside restaurant. I told a waitress to tell them to go smoke far away from the restaurant but she ignore me. So bad that my daughter had to smell that toxic from those rude people. Shame on them!
