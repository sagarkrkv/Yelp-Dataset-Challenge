This buffet was just amazing! Not your usual buffet fare - gnocchi in a wild boar ragu; veal sweetbreads; perfectly cooked roasted meats @ the carving station and the list goes on. I highly recommend it if anyone comes here.
After going to Bachannal and the Wynn buffet a few times I'm glad I finally got to try this place.  I came here for lunch and liked that they had a lot of the dishes they had to offer.  It wasn't as branchy as the the Wynn buffet and had more dinner like dishes.  There was a HUGE pile of bone marrow.  Thats crazy!  The Wicked Juice, grits with escargot and duck wings were the best.. . I think that the dessert section was a little small compared to Bachannal. The service needs some help but the food was that good that it still gets 4 stars.
I liked almost everything they had.  Did not like any of the desserts. I would go again.
I am nicknamed the "buffet bully" by my family. This is my go to buffet when in LV. Everyone I have taken here has been impressed! Only thing is that I wish they changed the menu once in a while.
Let me start off by saying that I'm not usually a fan of buffets. Between the random mix of foods, the sight of people shamelessly gorging themselves on subpar food, and the idea of everyone's grubby fingers manhandling the wares, they actually tend to gross me out. So, when a friend kept raving about this place every time he'd come back from Vegas, I was a bit skeptical. . . I finally broke down and tried it, and it's everything it's cracked up to be. The quality of the food is awesome. Loved the individual servings in small containers (diminishing the grubby finger issue). The beef brisket/carving station was incredible. My partner wouldn't stop raving about the fried chicken and mac and cheese. Their wicked juice is legendary. Makes for an amazing mimosa. Their dessert bar was not bad.  The service was great (don't forget to tip your server).  The ambiance is cool, it tends to attract a trendy 20-30something brunch crowd. . . No, this place is not cheap. But for the quality of the food, I'd say it's worth it.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.
Buffets like these are honestly worth it. Around $30-40 for endless creative options, when going to a fine dining restaurant and not even so or ordering room service, will cost you almost that much for just one dish.. . Came here for dinner and had a 2-for-1 deal, which was quite a steal. There was no wait unlike the time I came for brunch a few years ago in August, we waited over an hour. Service was great, as we were regularly attended to, regarding drinks and how everything was.. . The ceviche and tuna poke and their seafood in general were the best items for me. I also enjoyed this massive oyster in a tomato/curry like sauce. Their fried chicken and tandoori chicken were bland. I was intrigued by their asparagus creme, and while not bad, it was super odd and pretty unpleasant. Sister enjoyed the mac 'n cheese bar. Their pesto garlic mashed potatoes was quite nice, though the pesto flavor could have been stronger. They had thai ice tea ice cream which was amazeballs!. . Compared to the Wynn's buffet for brunch, the Wicked Spoon had more offerings and better service, but their quality in each dish wasn't as good as the Wynn's buffet. But nonetheless, a must try and great value in my opinion, considering all the high prices across the strip.
Love this buffet. My bf who is a picky eater also loved it. Our waitress was funny and friendly and kept those mimosas coming!!! Never had to flag her down once. And then she asked if we needed a to go cup for our mimosa. What...an...angel.
I went to this buffet around 7pm on a Sunday and they close at 9pm...most of the food was not very hot or fresh. The bread was dry. Most of it just seemed like it had been sitting out for a while.  I've been to some great buffets, unfortunately, I would have to say this is one of my least favorites. I was just not impressed by the food selection or the tastes. WAY too over priced for the quality of the food. I don't recommend.
I love Wicked Spoon!!! Been here twice from the very beginning since it first opened! Everything about this place is new and hip. There's no other buffet in Vegas like this! Everything comes in cute little cooking trays and pots like you have your own individual meal which is pretty awesome! I also think that it's a great way to not waste food since it's already portion controlled by being presented and prepared in the pots for individual servings. This is one buffet that you must visit when your in Vegas! Don't miss out on this awesome experience!
My cousins and I went here for lunch during a quick get-away to Vegas. There were many large groups of women (typical-bachelorette-party-recovery-luncheon ;D) . . It's not bad. Presentation was great. Sometimes it beat the taste. They do have a lot of items but not so much that interested me. Everyone craves different things at different moments and at that moment I just liked the mac and cheese and desserts. . . Maybe I'll try it again next time.
Really don't know where the negative comments came from but honestly I think the price and food are worth it. What other buffet serves bone marrow on their buffet line? It's my fave there, even if I can only have a few. And I know I get my money's worth with that alone. The rest of the main entrees are awesome too and I think the desserts are amazing as well. Can't go wrong with gelato!
Super friendly staff nice and clean. Awesome selection of every kind of food. Happy hour drinks are five dollars what a deal. Desserts are delicious and plentiful. Can't wait to go there again!!!  Tried the bone marrow not my favorite however the steamed salmon was out of this world.
Extremely unhappy with the food I got here. Spend your money elsewhere!! The food was SO BAD that it spoiled half of my day in Vegas. I haven't had such bad food in a long time.. . My fiance and I had went to Wicked Spoon a few years and it was my favorite buffet in Vegas at the time, but it has gone downhill since then. We paid 88ish total for the two of us. It's definitely hard to get your moneys worth here unless your fine eating crappy tasting food. . . FOOD:. The two most expensive things here are probably the crab legs and the prime rib. I don't really eat much cooked seafood, so I didn't eat the crab. I love steak, so I loaded up on the PRIME RIB. Unfortunately, it tasted like DOG FOOD. That spoiled my appetite and I couldn't eat much more. . . The rest of the food offered was super cheap stuff like hometown buffet-esque. I had some cheap chicken wings, pasta, etc. Everything tasted very subpar. . . The gelato used to be pretty good, but I think they get it from somewhere else now. It's much worse than before. It tasted very cheap and low quality and the texture was kind of melty. I had some lemon meringue and orange white chocolate cake that was pretty decent, but thats the only thing I semi-enjoyed. . . Overall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Wicked Spoon. Service isn't very attentive either. SERIOUSLY take your money to a nice restaurant and get yourself a high quality or steak or something. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!
Overall 3.5 stars. . We flew United into Las Vegas.  While on the plane from SFO to LAS, the flight attendants passed out what looked like a deck of cards.. . Opened it up and found card offerings at the Cosmopolitan including 2 for 1 at the Wicked Spoon.  Wicked Spoon's been featured on some food shows as a top notch buffet so I wanted to come and try it.. . I had to get a players card first from the Cosmopolitan.  It's called Identify.  What a gimmick.  Got my 2 for 1 voucher, and headed up to the Wicked Spoon for brunch buffet on a Monday.  Regular price $29.00 p/p.. . No lines.  We were seated immediately.  What I enjoyed about the Wicked Spoon - most items are in individual servings.  This is great.  Avoids overeating and overindulgence.  Food was fresh.  Great variety.  Don't look for a salad bar.  There isn't one.  But plenty of veggie and fruit items.. . There was a suckling pig on the rotisserie, but it wasn't ready yet.. . I can't say I had any favorites but what I ate was all good.. .
No, I didn't love spending the money that I did. The wait can be extra long if you don't get there at a good time. However, once inside, there's a plethora of things to stuff your face on. I tried Asparagus Mousse, Bone Marrow, Glazed Duck Wings, Mac and Cheese Bar, and Sriracha Watermelon just to name a few. The desserts were great as well with pineapple carrot cake, gelato, and tons of chocolate raspberry items.
Amazing food, lots of variety so something for everyone.  Everything I tried tasted amazing.  Wait staff were really good about clearing un-wanted plates and re-filling water.  I just wish I had a bigger stomach so I could try everything.
Very solid Las Vegas buffet located in the Cosmopolitan (back corner) on the second floor.  The service is decent and the offerings are pretty solid, although the dessert is fantastic.  Some dishes from brunch:. 1. hamachi sashimi with ponzu reduction - fresh and sliced thin with a tiny drizzle of ponzu. 2. salmon sushi - pretty meh salmon that didn't really taste that fresh. 3. saffron risotto with truffled honey - al dente rice and bland cheesy sauce.  Definitely not worth it. 4. shrimp takoyaki - the shell was nice and crispy but the inside was a bit on the soft, too chewy side. 5. papaya salad - make-your-own with a nice selection of toppings, including Chinese sausage. 6. kung pao chicken - passable but I did like the addition of zucchini. 7. beef with broccoli - very salty but not too bad. 8. roasted root vegetables with honey glaze - flavorful and tender with the perfect amount of sweetness. 9. mushroom carbonara - very good with a savory and creamy blend of pasta, peas, and mushroom in a white cream sauce. 10. wild boar bolognese - decent with a savory tomato sauce but the gnocchi was too soft and overcooked. 11. panna cotta goat cheese tower - loved this mild blend of goat cheese and a mandarin segment for decor and zest. 12. zuppa di pesce - very savory broth with plenty of jumbo shrimp, whitefish, and clams. 13. gelato bar - try the pistachio and classic vanilla!. 14. white chocolate apricot cone - just get 6 ofthese.  Seriously, they are that good.. 15. chocolate bundt cake - rich and  decadent with a semi-soft chocolate-ty interior. 16. cheesecake - pretty standard. 17. donut and passionfruit mousse - very fruity and sweet although my friend LOVED it. 18. chocolate mousse - very rich and had the consistency of hot fudge rather than a mousse. 19. strawberry eclair - decent but not amazing. 20. chocolate espresso rice kris pies treat - it's a nice twist on a classic and I enjoyed the blend of marshmallow, chocolate, and espresso. 21. macaroons - tried the raspberry and chocolate banana and felt that the shells and interior were way too chewy. 22. roasted salmon - decent with a buttery glaze . 23. prime rib - tender and flavorful. . Overall, a solid 3 stars for good food and service.  $35 for brunch with an option to upgrade to a 2 hr long period of endless mimosas and bloody mary's at $47 total.
At $45 per person for dinner, I really can't recommend this buffet as a good value anymore. They had some good items on the menu including BBQ pork, sushi, risotto, prime rib, bone marrow, crab legs, etc. My favorite part of the dessert bar was the ice cream section - they had some cool flavors like Thai tea and Pistachio. Overall, a bit overpriced, lacking in selection (not nearly as expansive as Bacchanal at Caesar, the Bellagio or Wynn buffets), but still one of the better buffets in town.
Best buffet experience I have had in Vegas better than bacchanal at Cesar's palace definetly recommend it
Awesome Buffet!  A ton of options ranging from Chinese, to American, to "build your own mac & cheese" bar, to seafood to appetizers. They also have a dessert bar if you save enough room.. . I came for lunch and it was $42 a person (before tax and tip).  It is a bit pricey....but for the price you get top notch food and a ton of variety.  I know people complain about the price but really? in Vegas you aren't going to find a good restaurant that you will pay less than 30-40/person anyway.  For the extra 10-20$...it is worth the variety in my opinion.. . Since it was my first time, I tried a little bit of everything that sounded good.  Man..."small portions" really add up when you are trying everything....I felt horrible after leaving because I gorged myself.. . Don't pass on the Tiramisu Gelato....it was amazing.
We came here on a Monday night around 7:30. We expected a long line but there was no line at all! This buffet is rather expensive but well worth it! The selection is amazing. Most every dish is in a small dish or pan. Everything tasted fresh and was very good! My husband is allergic to shellfish. Some of the buffets in town do not offer much for him to choose from. He was very pleased at the number of dishes he could eat. The service was amazing as well. We will definitely be back but only on special occasions because of the price
I don't usually go to buffet but my sister took us there. Great selection and very good. Except for desserts: they looked good but but the taste is just OK.
When I heard about the concept of Wicked Spoon's small plate buffet, I was excited. How many times have you been to a buffet only to be disappointed by the poor quality of 85% of the dishes there?  Wicked Spoon seemed like it had the potential to not fall into the quantity of quality trap with its unique concept.  They did have bone marrow there, which was kind of cool. Unfortunately, it ended up just being like almost every other Vegas buffet, just with nice plating.. . Almost everything sounds really good until you actually eat it. I was saddened that I wasted my calories on this place.  . . If you really have to buffet in Las Vegas, go off strip and go to Texas de Brazil, where EVERYTHING is delicious and quality.
This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.
I recently returned to Wicked Spoon for the second time.  While overall, it was still pretty darn good, it wasn't quite as mind-blowing as the first visit.  The space itself was still beautiful and clean, and the sevice was great. Our server was super attentive, making sure our drinks were constantly refilled and our used plates collected. . . The food itself just wasn't as up to par as the last time.  The brisket that had been heavenly before was bland and ice cold this time.  Maybe it was because the restaurant wasnt as packed that the brisket sat under the lamps for a longer time.  Who knows?  All I know is I had one cold bland bite and pushed it aside.  I decided to give the fried chicken a whirl.  I can see why it's so popular.  The  seasoning on the skin is really delicious.  But, when I went to eat a second leg, I found a long hair fried into the skin!!!!!  Ummm, gross.  So yeah, didn't eat anymore of that. Finally, the wicked juice they had last time had changed. Before, it was a sort of watermelon light nectar that was incredible, and mixed perfectly with champagne to create a different, refreshing mimosa.  This time, it was a heavy, almost smoothie like thick strawberryish juice.  When I tried to mix it with the champs, the entire drink would bubble over.  I tried to very slowly pour the juice into a half empty champagne glass the second round to control for the extra fizzing, but again, it bubbled over.  I think the smoothie like consistency of the wicked juice just didnt work with the champagne.  I was saddened the heavenly juice they had before was gone.. . But, it was not all a loss. I enjoyed the angry mac and cheese and the garlic foccacia bread. Both were satisfyingly delicious. Their gelato and cookies were also quite good.  . . So, I'm hoping they were just having an off day with some of the food.  My first visit was incredible enough that I will return once more and give it one more shot.
Excellent brunch!!! I am usually weary of buffets, because the quality that usually comes from making mass quantities is typically low. However, I was extremely surprised to see (well, taste) that WS was able to deliver on each and every piece on the menu. There was only one thing that I was disappointed in (gluten free red velvet cupcake), but I am assuming it was dry because it was gluten free. . I would have given 5 stars, however, you have a 2 hour time limit for unlimited mimosas, which I understand, but still wish they wouldn't impose that.
Loved the ambience, much more stylish than Bacchanal. The food is excellent, the portions, how they are decorated and served exceeded our expectations. Each dish is 5 stars.. The bacchanal has more to offer as for seafood but in the end the overall experience is A++++ would go there again and recommend it to everyone.
I have mixed feelings about wicked spoon. I heard so many good things about it so I felt like I had to try it. . . I liked the food but it was a little bit too much for buffet food. A lot of their dishes were not the kind of food you would want to eat after it sat out at a buffet.. . The food was too ethnic or reaching too high for a buffet. Just so/so.. . However the atmosphere is great and the dessert is really good.
Yum yum! Get in this belly! And I mean PORK BELLY! at one point, I had pork belly on my plate made 3 different ways. The desserts are awesome too.
Everytime I come to Las Vegas, I look forward to stuffing myself full here. This is probably one of the largest buffets I've been to with the widest variety of selection to choose from. A lot of their dishes are delicately plated in small portions which is great for portion control. . . I would recommend if you go here to scan the entire buffet first before digging in as you will stuff yourself silly before getting to some of the good stuff. I went last year on a Saturday night and quality of food was awesome! I went again this year on a weeknight and I found the quality mediocre. If i come again, I'd choose a weekend.
Went for the breakfast open buffet.....speechless!! . . Awesome!!!!!! Will come back for sure!
cute presentation but food wasn't so great.  the dessert especially was too sweet, too dry, or just bleh. not really worth the $35 for sunday brunch.
I went here for a reception dinner for a friend's wedding and it was amazing! So many items to chose from and the desert options were plentiful.
Nice buffet but nothing special. There are, for example, not a large selection of seafood.. Some courts simply did not taste. I had expected that otherwise. . There are definitely better buffets in Las Vegas
I've been here three times over the past two years. I like the idea of gourmet buffet food served in small elegant and varying ways, but the huge problem with that is that the food gets colder and staler quicker, which totally offsets the "prettiness" of the dish.  I liked the kalbi ribs but nothing else stood out during dinner.. until you find the godiva chocolate dessert. That alone gets five stars, but overall only three.
I have heard a lot about the amazing decadence of Las Vegas buffets. While I can't speak for all of them, at Wicked Spoon the Hype is real. I like to think I am a bit of a buffet connoisseur and let me tell you, this made everywhere else I have been to look like trash.. . We got to the Wicked Spoon a little after noon and there was a small line that moved quickly to pay and get into a different line to wait to be seated. The buffet was $35 and then another $12 for bottomless mimosas. My group was originally under the impression that the $35 covered  all food and drinks. I am not sure how they got that impression (quote from me walking to brunch "guys I read up on the buffets and this one is only $35 for food and unlimited mimosas" oops). Not a bunch to be deterred, we happily threw down our $47 on a mission to prove to WS that they would lose money on this deal. After some small confusion about whether we had included gratuity or not, they found a table for all twelve of us after only a few minutes. It was a bit odd that there was a decent sized line, but lots of open tables in the dining room. I am not sure if they did this because they didn't have the staff to keep up with all the tables or if they just wanted to build up the aforementioned Hype. Regardless they still seemed to do a decent job moving people through the line.. . Now let me tell you about the food: there is a lot of it and it is all delicious. A few things to keep in mind are, first, don't pick up the first five delicious dishes you see. If you do this you will accidentally be too full to enjoy even more delicious food you find later. The best thing to do when you arrive is to play it cool (don't squeal like a little girl when you first see all the food. People will look at you funny...I have heard) then walk around and look at all that WS has to offer. Once you have taken in all the beauty, decide the best way to spend your limited stomach space. This leads right into my second point: don't get bagels, bread and butter, etc. Yes, bagels are good and I am sure they are above average here, but don't fill up on bread. There are amazing meat and veggie dishes that you couldn't get for $2 at any given deli.. . The staff did a great job of clearing our plates and making sure our glasses were full. They quickly realized that keeping up with empty glasses was going to be a full time job at our table and conceded to giving us bottles of champagne and carafes of mimosa. Also, right before our two hour drinking limit was up we charmed our waitress into giving us a full bottle and carafe. She later regretted this..... . Something to note, while this buffet is far from stuffy it is not particularly rowdy. We realized this a little late and got some looks from other tables and management. . . This brunch was a great experience and even at close to $50/person I would highly recommend checking it out.
I came here last Friday with my mom, saw this place on the travel channel show: buffet paradise. I really wanted to try this because the Cosmopolitian wasn't bult yet on the strip the last time I was in Vegas.  The food is amazing and I like that the food is portioned in little dishes, pots, woks and plates.  Will was an excellent server who empathizes the free drinks that includes soda, tea and coffee.  The food was amazing, walked out so full! I want to go again the next time I'm in Vegas I will totally come here again!  I tried the noodle dish, fried rice, sushi, fried chicken, salad, teriaki chicken, shrimp cocktail, cakes and strawberry dip in chocolate, ice cream.  All so good!
If your a desert person then this is the buffet for you; however I am not.  On the savory side of things the selection can seem limited, plate after plate of similar items.  The bone marrow was a surprising treat that was quite unique to my knowledge for any buffet.  Don't get me wrong the food was amazing, but only sits at number two on my Vegas buffet list.  Care to guess who sits at number one?
Can't say that Wicked Spoon isn't an impressive buffet in terms of decor, service and presentation but what struck me the most during breakfast was a total absence of cheeses. I literally wasn't able to find a single slice of cheese at the whole buffet ( aside of shredded blue cheese). I find it to be very awkward.. Cured/deli meats and fish selection is extremely limited as well.
I enjoyed my first meal at Wicked Spoon after reading and hearing about what it had to offer for several months. We had a party of about 25 on a Saturday night before hitting The Chandelier bar at The Cosmopolitan. Some of the things I enjoyed was the roasted bone marrow which I spread on some challah bread & topped with a sprinkling of sea salt flakes. The combination was so sacrilegious but oh so damn tasty. Yumm. I had seconds so that was double the sin. I also liked the different salumi & other deli meats that you could pair with various crackers & cheese. The batter fried squid on a stick was delicious. The pan fried chow mein had good flavor. The furukake covered shrimp balls was mighty tasty. The lettuce cups filled with bamboo shoots and char siu pork in asian spices was also quite tasty.. . For dessert, I liked the salted caramel macarons which we thought was all out and it gave the females in the group a lightweight anxiety attack. Thankfully, 10 minutes later they reloaded. Wheww! Crisis averted. The standard coconut macaroons were also good. I really enjoyed the apple cobbler. It was still warm and tasted great. The miniature eclairs were just ok. I thought they would be better. . . Wicked Spoon is good. I recommend it. I like the different spin on the typical Vegas all-you-can-eat buffets. There was so much food to choose from that it's a little overwhelming at first. Service was good. They were always on top of clearing away our plates, refilling our drinks and offering us coffee at the end of the meal. The customer service of the waitstaff was really good. Would I go to Wicked Spoon again?? Yes. I definitely would.
I've eaten at most of the better buffets in Las Vegas over the years (Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Rio, Caesars, Mirage, Wynn, Paris and others) and I would rate the Wicked Spoon very highly. The main difference between the Wicked Spoon and other high-end buffets is the way they present the food. For the most part, each entree is prepared tapas style and served on a small plate or pan. You won't find the mountains of food on display like other buffets. Personally I liked this method and found that each entree was better prepared than at most other buffets where the entree is typically served in a large pan and you scoop up as much as you want.. . The downside of this method is that the large plate that they give you is not an even multiple of the smaller plate which means that it's fairly awkward to put a few small plates on the larger plate. Also, at some of the stations the small plates sit on a warming plate and they can get a bit hot to pick up.. . I thoroughly enjoyed the first dinner that I ate here, especially at the bargain price of $40. The entrees were very well prepared and I was very impressed with the quality and variety. A very nice selection of up-scale dishes were available. The salads and desserts were plentiful and beautiful as well. What you won't find is ordinary dishes which was fine with me but might be a problem if you bring your kids and they're looking for fried chicken or other basic dishes.. . I liked the place to much that I returned the next day for brunch for $23 and many of the dinner items were also available but several breakfast items were added. The brunch entrees were not prepared as well as the dinner items were, IMHO. I almost passed on the pancakes and french toast after a couple of disappointing entrees but found them to be some of the best I've ever had.. . Overall they seem to prepare dishes with rich and robust flavors which I really like. They are certainly not the largest buffet in Vegas but one of the best if you're more into quality than quantity. Worth a visit if you're looking for something different. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
This place is overrated!. . Service: three stars. The server was nice but was busy with other tables so we ended up being neglected for a while.. . Food: two stars: nothing but ordinary. However the presentation for buffet food was quite creative. They had salad in small bowls, a big glass bottle of water for each table instead of the server pouring from their pitchers. The only things we liked were their water and pistachio ice cream. Overall, almost $45 per person with that quality and the varieties of food is so NOT worth it.
Everything was so good. It's pricier than others casino buffets but completely worth the price difference in the quality of food and the quantity they have to offer. They have a Mac and cheese station where you pick out what veggies, meat and cheese you want in it and they make it in front of you and put it in a cute serving bowl. Everything is already in serving bowls or plates when you go and get it. They had sushi and a gelato bar also.
Best buffet I have ever seen better than  fancy  restaurant
We went to the Wicked Spoon with high expectation, but unfortunately we were disappointed. The food is just OK. For the money you pay, it is not worth going there. We will stick to the buffet at the Bellagio, which is so much better and worth the money.
I really enjoyed myself at the Wicked Spoon. For comparisons sake, I also went to the Bellagio's buffet for dinner. We dropped by 8pm on a Saturday to find a long line to get seated, ended up waiting for almost 50 minutes. Adult dinner was $41, children was about $27. . . Wicked Spoon has the standard buffet fares like prime rib, pastas, etc. Where it differs is presentation and "speciality" items. . . Some of the exceptional highlights:. -BIY Mac N Cheese bar. Delicious. Various meats (including shrimp) that you could add. . -Pastas and whatnot served in miniature, single-serving sized pots. Uber cute. . -Variety of ethnic foods: Mexican, east Indian. -Fun arrangement of desserts. Gelato, macarons, and exceptional cobbler among my favorites. The custard boob thing was definitely the dessert. . . The cons:. -Sushi was not good. . -Seafood selection wasn't particularly big or tasty. . -Getting seated in one of the U-booths was a PITA. . . Wicked Spoon has a more upscale atmosphere than Bellagio's buffet. It definitely feels more special and "Vegas-y". Between the two, I'd send you to Wicked Spoon if it's your only buffet visit. Highly recommended!
SO, the story of how we ended up here is that I was specifically craving SNOW CRAB. Not King crab, not crab, and whatever else crab is out there in the market. It was the only place that had snow crab so we went at 2:30p.m. to get in for the lunch time on a Sunday. Shockingly, the wait was only 30 minutes or so. It was nothing like the bachanal line that was about 2 hours. . . The food was alright, and the dinner was okay too. The food wasn't as good as Bachanal, but the dessert was definitely way better. I'm not sure if I'll be going back here, but I def think it is worth a try.  . . I did eat a ton of snow crabs though...
We came here the other day for dinner and yay the lines weren't long!  . . The prices were really really decent considering it is a Las Vegas buffet. $40 a person? Can't get much better! With that being said, they have a nice, tasty variety of food although they don't have as much as the other buffets. They only have snow crab as a seafood option as well as other tapa style options (ex. shrimp ceviche, blacked tuna..that sorta thing). So if you're looking for AYCE seafood, skip out on this place. All the food here is done and served tapa style so you'll have to make several trips considering you can only fit so many little plates on a large plate. Most of the food I tried, I loooved! My favorite? Thai tea ice cream! Yumssss
A solid buffet. It was my birthday so we decided to hit this place for brunch. I've read and heard positive things about this buffet so I decided to give this place a whirl. They have mini pots of gourmet Mac andcheese, tapas inspired servings of everything, kalbi ribs, their mashed potatoes were excellent.   Their buffet is split up into a variety of food stations, a meat station, an asian station (with Japanese, Chinese and Korean) Mexican, "American station, a section for salads, Italian, seafood, and an anti pasti bar. They have bone marrow at their meat station, which I'm not really into but everyone else seems to love. Had some sushi, wasn't particularly great but not bad either... they did have goat cheese panna  cotta, a  pretty tasty ceviche and mini crab knuckles, everything is served in teeny tiny bowls, which I appreciate... And I loved that they had a variety of kale and quinoa salads. They had a pretty dessert station but they didn't have macarons much to my chagrin. The pictures in yelp seem to show a bunch of different desserts, none of which were actually at the station. Sigh. I did have a good solid meal.... It's kind of pricey, but then what isn't in vegas? Def a great buffet- must visit when you're in town!
Came here with family for breakfast with a 2 for 1 coupon. Great deal that we found in the coupon booklets United airlines passed out.. Food was good, but the lunch items that came out looked even better. Too bad I was way to full to even try.  Highlights are fresh juices, omelette station, real bacon at the carving station and the desserts- chocolate covered strawberries and gelato!
I went here for brunch and wow! Let me tell you. This place is mops! First of all it's only $27 a head for a wonderful buffet on da strip. Inside da cosmopolitan on da strip. It has everything from a omelette station to a full one ice cream parlor. They have a great selection. From sushi to meats. I liked the smoked salmon it was so good. I also got da seafood saffron which was good. Can't go wrong with clams or shrimp. Omelette station is good, has a variety of selection to put in your omelette. There was a bit dessert selection. They have a whole ice cream showcase which one of da workers will serve you. They also have dark chocolate dipped strawberries with either Oreo or Heath bar crumbs. Good! If your on da strip and want a good place. Go eat at the wicked spoon! You won't go regret it!
Buffets are a true part of Las Vegas culture. Whether it be from the old town Vegas from the likes of The Golden Nugget to the heights of the new strip at the Bellagio, the buffet is a must visit in between the gambling & drinking.... In saying this, The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan is a must. From the decor within restaurant, to the cute little little ways of serving their food & most of all the quality of the food. . You may be paying a little more than your average Las Vegas buffet, however your taste buds will thank you for that little extra on you credit card. You name it, you can virtually get it at the Wicked Spoon, however be prepared to lose your wife & kids to the dessert bar...
Since there's already 3500+ reviews, there's not much I can add except to say WS is my favorite buffet ahead of Bacchanel and the buffets at Aria, Bellagio, and Wynn. . . The sense I got from other reviews was that Bacchanel overtook WS as the best buffetin Vegas...I don't think thats true, despite being a fan of Bacchanel as well.
I do not know. .first time..i may come.back.. . I suppose it starts with the entry.. As we were paying  the 40 dollars per person, the lady at the cash register was rude.. . Behind the counter is what distracted, talking, and everything but being nice to the customers... It doesn't matter for the buffet, or high end restaurant, a customer needs to be treated with respect.. That was not the case at all.. . Additionally, missing was thank you for being our customer.. They never think anybody for anything... . Servicw inside  the restaurant, we're no good.. Eventually got a guy called Robert, who was excellent.. But the rest of the service was terrible... . The food flavor was mediocre at best.. Nothing special. .. . Last..attached picture showed somerhing to eat..kt does not looke food..it looks  loke q coiled  snake or worse yetm..you know..
