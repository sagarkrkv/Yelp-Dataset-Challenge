I came to this thinking its just another fancy steak restaurant....(yes very expensive) but man I put this place hands down the best steak restaurant I been too. I travel a lot and every where I go always end up eating at least 1 steak restaurant. I order a Kobe wagyu (note to everyone) Kobe steak does exist but it comes from certain type or cows. It was $270 and that's someones week paycheck but it was worth it (order medium or medium rare). I would describe it as eat foie gras of steak... very rich flavored. I also had a piece of the local filet and when you do order this have them slice it for you. I have eaten here 3-4 times and I will always come back when I crave steak. Getting it comped is a plus for me.
Best Skirt Steak on the Planet. Need I say more.
I went here with the highest expectations and Craftsteak exceeded them. You can get Angus beef, prime, dry aged, etc....etc at any steakhouse. You can't get Wagyu. And if you're going to get Wagyu, go to Craftsteak and get the Chef's Wagyu Beef Selection. This is the best value for Wagyu beef and you won't regret it. You are permitted to request and substitute as you wish. Just make sure you go in with an appetite. Service was impeccable and easily five stars from Eric and his team.. . I went with two other hungry buddies and had three amazing courses, all five stars. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. . . Drinks: complimentary champagne (thank you), 18 year Jameson, and $45 wine flight with chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, and tokaji. . . Appetizers: dinner rolls, frisee salad, shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella. . . Entrees: Wagyu filet, Wagyu skirt steak, and Wagyu strip with potato puree, roasted peppers, and Brentwood sweet corn as sides. . . Desserts: Monkey bread, carrot cake, blueberry creme brulee, fruit plate, sorbet assortment, and after dinner chocolate brownie/cake.. . With all that food, the beef was still the star. I would do it again in a second and would recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves beef.
Most unpleasant dinner I've ever had! Before ordering I told my waiter that I am allergic to nuts and fruits. He assured me that he had it written down and he will notify ALL chefs! With that in mind my boyfriend and I ordered the Domestic Wagyu chef's selection. Comes as a 3 course meal. The first two courses were not too bad, everything went downhill when dessert hit the table. EVERY SINGLE DESSERT HAD NUTS AND FRUITS! seriously?! I told my waiter that I am HIGHLY allergic. They apologized and told me they will make me something else. 45 MINUTES LATER they come back saying i'm sorry our chef's cannot accommodate you! Seriously? it takes 45 minutes? Not only that, he comes back and tells me he will give me a lousy scoop of ice cream instead. He said "You Paid for it" might as well eat something. Unacceptable, my dinner was $400! If I would have known I wouldn't have chosen the stupid Chef's Selection! Not only that they did not have the courtesy to have the Manager come out to tell me anything they can do to help me. Ridiculous place. DO NOT GO HERE.
I had high expectations of this place. The one thing I should say is that the service was fantastic. If you have not ever eaten at a high end steak house you would probably be pretty impressed. Although being a bit of a foodie, and having eaten at many 4 diamond establishments, I am probably a bit more savvy when it comes to fine dining than your average Vegas patron.. . Like i said the service here was excellent. I have no complaints at all in that department.  A solid 4 stars there.. . We started with the fries (which we were told were amazing) and the divers scallops. The fries were very good...an amazing culinary revelation? No. The divers scallops were pretty meh, scallop quality was decent no the best I have had. They lacked that flavor profile and pop they should have had. . . I ordered the braised short ribs and my fiance the rib eye. Both were good but again not amazing, short ribs were not anything I couldn't have made at home.. . Sides we ordered asparagus and potatoes au gratin, they again lacked that real pop I would have expected.. . If you are looking for a real treat Strip Steak at Mandalay bay would be you best bet. That was up there with the best food I have ever had.
A good meal on 10/1/14. Very reasonable price for the quality of the meal and great service. Not my favorite meal in Vegas but worth the visit.  The interior of restaurant is less than special and reminds you of a low end Vegas buffet versus a fine dining establishment. I would visit again if on this end of the strip but would not make a special trip.
The place was nice and staff was polite. BUT the food was just ok. My favorite party was the free bread with butter before the actual meal. Now that's pretty bad. We got oysters which they were not bad, cucumber salad was missing something, I loved the purely mash potatoes (can't remember the name),  asparagus so so wouldnt order again,filet mignon one we had to send back it was almost back grilled not what we ordered. I got surf and turf which was alright.  The waiter was very kind and apologetics for the steak. Next time in Vegas. I would pass on this place. Not a winner. Try SW at encore.
WOW!! . Let's start with their fresh petite oysters! OMG, i can have more of that as my entree.  The ambiance is very elegant; beautiful lighting; made it perfect for any special occasion.  Glad that we went here on our first nite out on the Strip.  He had the NY Steak (which was crazy good) while i had Scallops and the asparagus was prepared in perfection. The services was pretty awesome too. Definitely a must go to for any of you celebrating something very special and would like something intimate.
Great food, super friendly and attentive staff, great drinks and ambiance.. . I ordered the T-Bone Steak which was outstanding and very flavorful. My wife ordered the Filet Mignon which was tasty but a bit overcooked. . . The complimentary bread was freshly baked - delicious. We shared an ordered of asparagus and half orders of the Mashed Potatoes and Risotto.  Probably one of the best risottos we have had. . . The drinks were good - not overwhelmingly strong but very flavorful. The service was outstanding. The staff is very attentive and helpful. No complaints. . . Recommend it for a group outing or for a dinner date... The place is good for both.
Vegas 5 Days 3 Nights at steakhouses and unfortunately they were all this trip from OK to downright awful.  Our last night was going to see a show at the MGM and we decided for simplicity sake to eat there at one of their many restaurants.  Craftsteak was the selection. . . 5 of us arrive and its a handsomely appointed modern vibe type steakhouse that certainly has the ambiance downpat. We had requested a table not a both and there are no tables available in the main dining room so they stick us in an ANNEX room that appeared to be part of the private dining area. Just us 5 here took away from the incredible ambiance of the place. MAJOR STRIKE 1.. . Wine list presented and 150% to 200% mark up on the wine but the sommelier was very good and we ended up with a not over the top price wise cambernet that was excellent.  Hot Buns more like whitel castle hamburger buns were served as we perused the menu that aparently changes daily.  Heavy meat selections almost no fish  with very high price points particularly to the point only 2 of their cuts were prime meat so you are talking overkill for a step down in grade. . . A Beets Salad to start was fresh and tasty but really had nothing to offer that made itspecial $15.00. . Roasted red peppers with garlic chips.. Not quite sure what that ment but they were out of jar red peppers with no taste and some sliced garlic and olive oil $15.00 (FAIL). . 2 Shrimp Cocktails 5 to order 12 to a pound size shrimp $24.00 each... Umm HELLO over priced so I could not get past the price points for the ok Shrimp. . . 1 Ceasar Salad $15.00 Nothing Special at all . . . Dinner:. 2 bone in Prime Rib Eyes were OK and their steak knives were awful ... Their 3 Bone IN NY STRIPS were also OK but with prices points of 69.00 each they are Completely out of their Minds.  All and all Price was Steaks Fail.  Sides were Asparagus dry and tasteless. French Fries Good. Rissoto excellent and baby shitake mushrooms sauteed tasteless  ...5 Coffees hot and fresh... . So 5 Persons 2 bottles of wine with the above order and with tip $1025.00 Sorry folks I don't mind paying for top shelf but from the seating to the really fail food I can't go over two stars here. PASS better options around.
Place is a great steak house. The family style is the way to go and let the chef pick what he sends out. I have been here a few times and always like to go here if anyone I know is staying at MGM. Thinks it's the best restaurant in that whole hotel.
I must first start off and say I've never had steak before. I was advised by my friend if you're gonna have steak, you might as well have the best. So we decided Tom Colicchio might know a thing or two about steak. Therefore if you are a steak connoisseur, look at someone else's review! . . Pros:. Very nice casual atmosphere. . My water glass was always filled... always... like if I just think about my water I see a water person waiting in the corner ready to refill my glass. . Very little noise,  not like creepy deserted quietness, more like a nice low murmur. . . Waiter and all the staff we met were very kind and courteous about everything. . Cons:. . I don't know if it'll be too memorable. The food was good, the service was good but when I come back to Vegas again I'm not going to be like "I have GOT to go to Craftsteak, like OMG gurl.". . 4 stars
