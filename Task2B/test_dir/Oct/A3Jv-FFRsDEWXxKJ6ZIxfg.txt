Service is great. The place looks amazing and like you could party there all night long but you're not allowed to! Haha!. . The food is delicious, but not compared to BurGR or Gordon Ramsay Steak.. . We also met Scott Commings, winner of Hell's Kitchen 12 which was pretty damn awesome! . . A must go if you haven't. You won't be disappointed.
The fries with the fish and chips are frozen and are almost indistinguishable from McDonalds fries.  This is a $30 and you don't even get fresh potatoes.. . With all Ramsey's television concern over food being frozen, I'm surprised one of the pub's signature dishes uses frozen, cheap ingredients.
Stopped in here for dinner before a show. This place is decorated in English pub style. A wall of beer barrels is kind of a cool look. Now onto the food....... Ordered their wedge style salad and a BLT.. The salad was awful and I sent it back. You could tell right away that this salad was pre-made and had been sitting around way past it's sell-by date.. Lettuce was wilted and rubbery. Ugh. Told the waitress that it was not acceptable and she took it away. Here comes the manager to apologize and to ensure that it will not happen on my next visit and he would remove it from the bill. Fine.. Now onto the BLT. This sandwich had a maple flavored bacon that just overpowered the sandwich. It was not good at all. The only thing I enjoyed was the cold pint of Heineken that I had with my meal.. . Here comes the bill and guess what. The salad was still there. I flagged down the waitress who was surprised that it was on it. How about checking it before you hand it to me?. . I have seen Kitchen Nightmares where Gordon Ramsay shreds every dish he tastes as awful. Hey Gordon, why don't you check out your namesake restaurant and see what you think of it.. . Will not return. Vegas has much better places than this money grab.. . Cheers to all
My Girlfriend and I stopped to see the Packer game and could not have been more disappointed.  Atmosphere was great, staff was friendly, but the food "insert funny Gordon Ramsay saying".  We got two beers and the chicken pot pie. Pretty sure it was made from all cheap, canned products. I've have better chicken pot pie from the freezer section at Wal-Mart.  Also the beer drafts were blocking the view to the TV to watch the game at the bar.  We wished we would have went else where.
Had the bacon cheeseburger was really really good! In fact enjoyed it so much came back the next morning for breakfast. Had corned beef skillet which was amazing but really filling.
As a fan of Hells Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares and Master Chef, I had to make a visit to one of his restaurants right? We'lll I picked this one.. . I looked at the menu prior to leaving my hotel - and I wanted the "Short rib and cheek sandwich" not realizing that was on the lunch menu. So when I got there, I grabbed a seat at the bar. Looked at the menu and didn't see it, I was totally bummed. We'll I went outside the box and got the lamb burger. It took about 15 minutes for my burger to come out. It was good, but the fries were just regular fries. Not the fries you see in all the Yelp pics and on the Ramsay website. . . I was somewhat disappointed - I really wanted the short rib sandwich and the fancy smancy fries. The lamb burger, while it was good, was no where worth $21. Come on Ramsay, I know its Vegas and all, but don't you think $21 for a lamb burger is a bit excessive? . . Will I come back? Probably not...
Overpriced overrated. Overall not that good my food needed salt I was afraid to ask for it
Great experience! We had the filet mignon, wine and the sticky toffee pudding! Loved our waitress Lisa from North Dakota! She was so good that she made the entire evening a super enjoyable experience! The wine was great and was a great price point. I would eat there again in a heartbeat.
I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan, love all his shows and his passion for excellence.  He reminds me a bit of myself in my college years striving for perfection over the cast iron grill at Buffalo Wild Wings.. . Being a fan I was excited to try this place.  What to order?  this was the hardest question to answer since the ACT.  I wanted a burger but thought I should get out of my comfort zone and try something a bit more British, so I went with the pie sampler.  I thought this was a great idea so I could sample all the taste Gordon has to offer but it backfired a bit because it really is just an appetizer, so I was still a bit hungry afterwards.  Each meat pie was about as good as a meat pie can get, but that's not saying much.  Looking back I should have ordered either a whole pie or the burger, or maybe the sampler and a burger.  My friend had a burger and it looked amazing, I stole some fries when he wasn't looking, very good.  I will be back to try the burger.
OVERPRICED! Awful service and the food was so-so at best, in fact my daughter got sick on the ride back to the hotel from the Sheppard's pie. I ordered the BLT because I heard it was the only thing on the menu that was good. to be fair it was, but not good enough to justify the price. Gordon Ramsay should yell at himself for how bad this place is.
Amazing food. My wife and I stuck to drinks and appetizers but it was all exceptional. The Executive Chef's English ale onion soup was essentially an immaculate play on the French onion soup. We ordered desert first and the salted caramel cheesecake was a decadent start. The seared diver scallops and chicken pot pie were exceptional as well. The service was attentive. So much so that our waitress replaced the mocha martini that was cleared early by a busser. No charge for it on the final bill. Love this place!
We made a last minute reservation and we are so glad we did. The food was amazing. Best Rack of Lamb and Prime Rib. Truffle fries were delicious and the Sticky Toffee Pudding is to die for.  Good atmosphere and Tayler F took wonderful care of us. He even talked chef Scott into visiting our table. Best meal and experience we've had in Vegas. This should be on every 'not to be missed ' restaurant in Vegas.
Great ambiance and vibes. Perfect for game days and date nights. Quick seating. Noise level is medium. The staff was very friendly and always moving. The GM and house manager were very alert, always smiling, and seemed to communicate with the staff on a consistant level. Our server, Tara, was A+. Very kind and sweet with quick feet. She is a great asset to your company. The food was very well balanced and fresh. Very good coffee. I highly recommend the sliders. We will deff be back soon! Thanks Ramseys and Tara! 5+
3 stars, huh.  Could a Ramsay place be only 3 stars?  The Yelp rating says so, are the people right?  . . $30 for Fish & Chips?  Ridiculous, right?  After all, it's nearly 2x what I've ever paid even though it was super beautiful white fish; 2 smallish pieces with a generous amount of fries, and a very little ramekin filled with fresh peas (and a bit of mint).  The flavor of everything was great even though I didn't have one bite with both fish & coating -- it broke when cutting it.  (3.0 stars due to price). . $18 for Sandwich?   It was terrific, though.  Chicken pesto with roasted peppers, arugula, tomato, caramelized onions.  Cold chicken, but the toasted bread was so good, it made up for it.  British?  (4.5 stars). . $11 dessert?  Sticky Toffee Pudding (available at all Ramsay eateries) is to die for.  Served with sweet cream ice cream and warm caramel poured over before your very eyes.  Mmmmm.  (4.5 stars). . Service was slow to begin with, but when Daisy finally made it over, she was all over my dining partner and I.  Very responsive, fun, and efficient.  (4.5 stars). . It's a really excellent pub, with drafts (Boddington's, $11) but expensive/costly/pricey.  Beautifully constructed, painted (like a pool table), and many different rooms offering a little different feel depending on your desire.  But, it's really expensive.  For that, I came and conquered but may not return.
Meeeh .... Went there last night for dinner, the hostess seemed uninterested. When we finally got sat, even though there were plenty of seats, it took the waitress at least 5-8minutes to acknowledge us. We ordered calamari which was great! We also got a rack of lamb, first it was over cooked so we sent it back - then it was basically raw. We ate a few bites and paid the bill. very disappointing from such a well known place.
Had zero plans to eat lunch here while out shopping inside Caesar's Palace.  But whatever it was that led me here - hunger, tired feet, FATE - I'm so glad it did.  This was hands-down my favorite lunch out of all the places we tried on vacation.. . First of all, I loved the decor of the restuarant.  You really felt this is what a real English pub would look like.  It could be an Americanized version for all I know, but I still liked it.. . Our service was great.  Very friendly wait staff.  There were water spots on my husband's fork, which isn't even that big of a deal, but our waiter noticed it (without us pointing it out first) and replaced it right away.  I thought that was a very nice, above-and-beyond touch.. . I started off with a very delicious cocktail called Goodbye Blue Sky,which was blueberry vodka, Chambord, sparkling wine and fresh lemon and blueberries.  So refreshing.  I hardly ever finish my cocktail at any place I go, but this one could have easily begat a second one as much as I loved it.. . We decided to pass on appetizers as we didn't really want to stuff ourselves for lunch (knowing we had a very large dinner ahead of us later).  I debated on what to order because so many things sounded delicious.  Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, even considered ordering several apps as my entree (Scotch Egg - yum!).  Finally decided to go classic English pub and ordered the Fish and Chips.  This was without a doubt the best fish and chips I've ever eaten.  Three lovely pieces of beautifully battered white fish - the texture was spot on (crispy and light), fish cooked to perfection.  Served with a side of mushy peas, which were also very tasty.  They were minty, although I didn't taste too much of it.  If I could complain about anything, I'd say the fries were nothing special.  The weren't horrible by any means, but for $30 you may expect something hand-cut at the very least.. . Everytime we see a Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert, we have to try it.  For something not chocolately, this bread pudding is surprisingly good.  Warm, with a rich caramelly drizzle atop a delicious sweet cream ice cream.  It's like a comfort dessert - you leave feeling wrapped in a warm blanket, cozy and comfy.  Perfect ending to a fantastic meal.. . The only thing I wasn't keen on was the price of the food.  Now, I can eat expensive food, and have no problem paying for it.  But let's be honest - this was not an upscale 5-star restaurant.  It's a pub with above average food.  It's not overly gourmet or made with luxury ingredients.  I'd say you're paying for the Gordon Ramsey name for the most part.  Don't get me wrong cuz the food was spectacular, but it could definitely handle being slightly cheaper.  Lunch food shouldn't cost over $100 for two people.
OK I'm going to keep this simple -. . Food:  OK.  Scotch Egg (yes, just one lonely egg) was decent but served cold, Fish and Chips were average (but $29 for two pieces of fried cod and a handful of fries? REALLY?), braised short rib was quite tasty BUT the risotto it was resting upon was extremely undercooked.  Not al a dente but damn near raw.  Sticky Toffee Pudding was pretty darn good.. . Service:  OMG how slow can we go????. . Atmosphere:  It's a pub. Really, it's a pub.. . Beer:  Selection isn't that great.  About $12 per pint.. . Value:  You have got to be joking!  I know that this is a celebrity chef owned establishment on the Strip, but almost $150 before tip for the above mentioned meal (oh, and two beers and one cocktail)?  I mean come on, you can get basically the same thing at many other on-strip pubs for half the price. If the food was exceptional, the price may be justified.  Unfortunately it wasn't.. . Bottom Line:  Good but flawed food (the food does prevent a 1-star rating).  Poor service.  Way overpriced - even by strip standards.
For Gordon Ramsey this place is a disappointment.  The warm pretzels were not so warm or soft.  The deviled eggs were tasteless.  I was really disappointed in these.  For the price this place is charging it's a pure embarrassment.  This is nothing than a tourist rip off.  I would have rather paid for McDonalds.
The Good:. . - Tenderloin was excellent.. - Sticky toffee pudding was great.. . The bad:. . - Bangers and Mash. Sausages were bland, rubbery, and the ends were too close together. Stingy portion of barely-warm mash. This is such a simple pub dish, it is a shame it is not done well. Lincolnshire sausages with hearty mash would be so much better. . - No custard option on the sticky toffee pudding. Although good with the ice cream it just feels like the lazy option. Not very authentic for a pub. . . The ugly:. . - Poor selection of draft beers, especially from the UK and Vegas area microbrews. Mostly standard beers you can get at many bars. The exception is Fullers, and to a lesser extent Boddingtons. . - Everything is seriously overpriced, even for Vegas. Add 50% to what you think is reasonable, and you'll be in the ballpark of what you are going to pay. . - The prices may be justified with fine dining food or service, but you don't get either. You get adequate food and service. . . 3-3.5 stars seems about right.
We waited a bit for our table, but we showed up 12 strong with only an hours notice,  and they threw six apps at us to make up for the wait.  Bangers and mash turned out great and nobody walked away hungry.  Great bourbons (nothing really rare, just a a bunch of good ones) and good craft/import beer selection.
Enjoyed my two lunch visits to the pub.  Rather surprised by some of the low ratings.  The Sheppard pie was quite good, but my two favorites were the steak pie and the goat burger.  Both were excellent.  . . The service was fair one visit and very good on the 2nd.   I would definitely return.
Beer is phenomenal, mixed drinks are well-poured, I would consider stepping into a cage and fighting a beastly man over the rights to have some of this food, and a super friendly bar staff and management.. . Asked for a special request to get into the kitchen, and although they were hesitant because of how busy they were, they played along with us and eventually allowed us to meet the chef and give him our sincere thanks for a wonderful meal.. . Great time, great place, possibly the BEST food I've ever had (which was diverse also), and overall a fast and friendly environment. Would definitely recommend to absolutely anyone for a quick beer or for amazing dining!!!
Chef Ramsay needs to be scolded as what he does on the TV show.... Worst food to eat...Good to Take a picture but definitely not to eat.... Yelp didn't allow me to choose 0 star..else I might have opted it..
I had a late lunch today at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill today.  Gord and I are fans of Hell's Kitchen and MasterChef so I thought I'd check it out.. . It was fairly packed so I sat at the bar rather than wait for a table (a 15+ minute wait).. . It's in Caesar's Palace so it's not cheap.  I ordered a burger and fries (without lettuce, onion and cheddar and added bacon).  It took about a half hour ... Charlie, the bartender, said the kitchen was backed up.  It was good but could havebeen hotter (I guess it was sitting around for a while).  It was rarer than I like it but tender and juicy.. . The experience was okay, not outstanding.
Went their had a great time food was great bartenders where nice . Just don't sit by the taps kept getting sprayed by the glass rinser kind of a bummer
Request a booth on the right with a TV.  The warm pretzel bread with cheese sauce was amazing. We ordered Sheppard's Pie and Flank Steak and shared. The Flank steak was one of the top steaks ever ordered in a restaurant, so tender and perfect. Loved the cocktails. The Sheppard's Pie looked smaller than it was - very filling, even for two, if you get another plate too.  It's shredded beef and was so tender. We couldn't finish it all.  The onion soup was great - a little sweeter and less salty than the french version.  My husband wanted to add salt, but there's none of that on the table. Without reservations, we'd have waited a while. It's only steps away from the concert venue, Elton John, so perfect place for dinner if you plan to see that show. The service was good - four or five hostesses to greet you - which one do I choose. The bartender was swamped, so took a while for drinks.  The manager came by several times and walked the restaurant a lot.  The guy who dropped off our food asked if we would be sharing and offered to bring sharing plates.  I loved the initiative of that. We never had to wait for plates to be cleared - they were picked up right away.  Definitely allow 2 hours for your dining experience.  It's not a fast-food restaurant.  This is a place to come and savor your meal, the company, and the ambiance.  Nothing is rushed, which I loved.  The table was never crowded and plates weren't coming out on top of each other.  The entire staff was pleasant and enjoyable - contrary to the punk get-up.  . . I read the reviews prior to coming and almost went somewhere else.  Geez, you guys are hard to please.  I LOVED my experience!  it was pricey, but the special occassion warranted the splurge.  And it's Vegas.  You expect that there.  Glad I decided to take a risk and find out for myself.  I hope others can take these reviews with a grain of salt too.  My only regret was that we were too full for dessert.   Oh, also regret not ordering the deviled eggs at the bar while we waited for our reservation.  Certain menu items in the bar are not available at the table.   Will definitely go back!. . Suggestion:  If you plan to have a full dinner, make reservations and request a booth or a high table.  A lot of the tables are low, better for drinks and appetizers, but not a meal.  And also request the back of the restaurant.  I also didn't like the fishbowl effect of the front of the restaurant.  Once you're well inside the restaurant, you feel more cozy and intimate.
There is nothing special about this restaurant.  I'd actually give it 1 1/2 stars if I could.  . . First, the only appetizer they were out of was the pot pie sampler - our server only told us that when I attempted to order it.  Oops - it would have been nice to be told that before getting my heart set on it.  . . We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, which came with french fries. and the lobster roll.  The highlight of the meal were the fries, very crispy and served with a ketchup/horseradish condiment.  The sandwich was dry and not very flavorful.  The lobster roll had more roll than I would have hoped for and more mayo than needed.  . . The service was merely adequate - our server took the order, delivered the order and then brought the check.  Hmmm... as a local, you kinda expect at least a check-in by your server to find out if you need anything else.  . . I guess Mr. Ramsay figures that tourists will eat at his restaurant because of his fame and then, who cares.
I was really looking forward to GR Pub & Grill.  I lived in London and worked in a pub in my younger days and was hoping for some good pub food.  I checked out the menu online and thought it looked great.  We had reservations and were seated quickly.  Menu wasn't the same as online but pretty close.  Service was slow.  They were busy and I was catching up with an old friend so not a problem.  I ordered the Lobster Roll to start and Fish and Chips for my entree.  I asked to upgrade the chips to Truffle Chips and was told that was fine.  My friend got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich.  It took 45 min to an hour for our food to come out.  My Lobster Roll never came and I got regular chips instead of the truffle ones.  My friend liked her sandwich but I wasn't impressed with the fish and chips.  First off they aren't chips, they are american french fries.  They did not seem hand cut at all, more like out of a bag.  The fish was ok but nothing special.  It wasn't terrible by any means but I expected more for $30 fish and chips, especially from Gordon Ramsey.  The menu still looks great and I have had good experiences at other GR restaurants so I'm sure I will be back at some point.
One star for Richard E. yet the food is good. . . I have been here a few times and normally the service is as good as the food, however this time the service was horrible. We were rushed to order our main dish and asked repeatedly in a span of 3 minutes to order dessert. No the place was not packed at all.  . . Note this was for game 7 of the 2014 World Series, so I could assume the staff just wanted to watch rather than have to serve that night.  If your place has pub in its name and numerous televisions you should expect people may get the idea they can enjoy a game there.  . . I thought it may have been because we asked to switch tables (something I don't do normally) in order to see the game, but the table next to us has the same problem with the server.
