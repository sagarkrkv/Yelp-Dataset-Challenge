Super cool and best of all, free. The party on Fremont is hopping on the weekends. Tonight I've seen Experience shows from Heart and Bon Jovi. Quite cool.
During my trips to Vegas, I've been to Fremont Street twice!. There is so much energy and it really is a different crowd of people which makes for some good entertainment :) with that being said.... DO NOT bring your kids! There were girls and some guys standing around with barely anything on, practically naked. Definitely something your little ones shouldn't be looking at! . . Gambling? Craps and blackjack had a very low minimum and the slot machines were 'antique'..very cool! . . Alcohol? So cheap!! Margaritas were like $3 and draft beer was $2 pretty sure I would've spent over $20 on those drinks alone on The Strip. . . Food? I've never eaten here..when you see an advertisement for a steak and lobster entree for $9 you should probably be worried..haha! . . Overall, I had a great time on both of my trips to the Fremont Street Experience although I only spent around 2hr here each time, that's all we needed ;) . I do recommend the Zip Line at night, very fun and exhilarating!
Worth at least one visit, the FSE is another facet of Vegas:  bigger, brighter, and in surround sound. The crowds that gather here are a good mix of 70% Asian tourists, 20% homeless panhandlers and/or performers, and 10% visitors-with-a-local-guide, it gets jam-packed at night. I prefer to go in the day when the vibe is more mellow, but you won't get the full effect.. . Live performances and musicians are here nearly every evening, weekdays included, and there are food and drink specials as far as the eye can see. Once you've had your fill, wait for the music to cue, and look up: the ceiling is a giant screen brought to life, cycling through a series of ads and music in a format you've never seen before.. . Newest addition to the area is the zipline, but the people watching alone is entertainment enough for me.
Young or old, meek or wild, hungry or thirsty, this is the ultimate vegas must experience on the what to do in vegas list. . . Mere words cannot describe the fun in store for your  "only in vegas"  trip down this very crazy lane! . . Trust me,  just go, have fun, and leave the kiddies with a sitter!
This morning I took the bus downtown and checked out the Fremont Street Experience, which is a pedestrian mall and attraction and occupies the westernmost five blocks of Fremont Street.. . Fremont Street had Las Vegas' first hotel (the Hotel Nevada in 1906, present day Golden Gate), first telephone (1907),  first paved street (1925), first Nevada gaming license (issued to the Northern Club) first traffic light, first elevator (the Apache Hotel in 1932) and the first high-rise (the Fremont Hotel in 1956). The Horseshoe was the first casino to install carpeting, while the Golden Nugget was the first structure designed from the ground up to be a casino.. . For many years, the western end of Fremont Street was the area most commonly portrayed whenever producers wanted to display the lights of Las Vegas.  By 1992, 80% of the Las Vegas casino market was on the Strip. Downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos sought to build an attraction that would lure more visitors to their businesses.  In addition to casinos and restaurants/bars, there are lots of stores if you are looking for souvenirs, sunglasses, hats, jewelry, etc.. . The free Viva Vision light shows (the Viva Vision canopy is the world's largest video screen) at night are apparently amazing!
