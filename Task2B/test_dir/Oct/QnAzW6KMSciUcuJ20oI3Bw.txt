My kids (even the 3 year old!) ask to go here all the time! We've enjoyed everything we have tried, and we love the overall setting. Only 4 stars, because the food is good, but not spectacular... and it would be much more enjoyable if I didn't have to share my food with the flies!
Foods decent, fun to take people to as a tourist thing.
Amazing bbq chicken pizza and fresh strawberry milkshake. Love the atmosphere and great service. Couldn't ask for more.
We had a fantastic breakfast here today! Joes grows much of their own produce, and the result is fresh tasting dishes, made to order at great prices. . . My friend and I split two dishes- the pancakes with bacon and the chicken egg scramble. The pancakes were fluffy and light, served with tasty syrup and whipped butter of course! The chicken in the scramble was so succulent and flavourful, and the veggies still had a nice bite to them. . . Good strong coffee rounded out the meal, not to mention dining out back in the sunshine! Will definitely be back to try out the lunch options!
Loving this local spot. Fresh food, family business and super kid friendly. Always take my out of town guests here!!!
Probably one of the best fresh food restaurants I've ever been to! I've never had the breakfast here until 2 weeks ago when I brought my dad and uncle and we all got the waffles and ribs. Never heard or even thought about this combination for breakfast but we went for it anyway and loved it! Thanks for the great food!
Yumm so good and pleasant! Geat place for  after winning a soccer tourney!!! Gooooooal!!!!!!!
Great food!!!!
What is going on???  First time I went there the foods were just fantastic but then the second time was disappointment and the third was worse.  Their salads didn't taste as fresh and their salad dressing was wayyyy salty.  I can't even remember what I ordered last time because it was just forgettable.  I don't know if I want to go back.  I gave them 4 stars first time visiting and now 2 after the third time eating there.  I am afraid next time I go I might put them in 1 star.  Get it together Joe's Farm Grill.
Wow! Just Wow!. . This place is amazing and love the set up of the restaurant. It never ceases to please my wife and I. It is indeed pricey but definitely worth it. Presentation of their dishes are appetizing and the restaurant is clean. Overall the meals are fresh but don't think it's healthy (if your that individual who cares). There are healthy meals the offer, salads mainly but don't pass up on their sandwiches or burgers. Their menu is very diverse for your taste and I'm trying to get thru the entire menu but I keep getting stuck on their BBQ Blue Cheese Burger or their Pesto Chicken Sandwich because it's SO GOOD! I have yet to try their breakfast but without a doubt, I won't be surprised it's good as their lunch and dinner menu.. . If your in the area. Go here!
Tried Joes on a recommendation from friends. Definitely a delicious lunch. Love the BBQ! I would return.
Was an Ok experience, love the picnic tables however not the dirt.  Not sure there is much you can do about the flies being outside.  Would really like to see an area to refill coffee instead of standing in line at the food window behind several people
yummmmm
The Fontina Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  . . Some reviews need no further explanation.  . . Go eat this burger.  Do it.  Do it now.
Go-to items include: seared ahi sandwich and crispy chicken basket. Chicken bAsket is not to be mistaken for the traditional tenders you get. These are actually large pieces of juicy breast with panko breading. Pretty awesome. The Caesar dressing is also extra anchovy-y which is the way it should be. Ask for it on the side to savor the flavor. . . I'm not big on the BBQ even though its sister location specializes in it and is carried over to their menu. It's nothing special to me. I like Rudy's BBQ better. . . Need to come when the date shake is in season. Sounds interesting to try. . . Avoid coming on weekend nights, line too long.
Savored every bite of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries. Cole slaw had a little too much onions for my taste. Guy Fieri's recommendations were right on.  My hubby enjoyed the Fontina Burger another must have according to Mr. Fieri. Great place to hang out for great food.  Don't let the lines fool you... It moves fast and worth the short wait. Very casual, so come ready to sit on picnic tables around there grassy lawns. Oh their Medjool Date shake is a perfect sweet treat to your meal. Yummy!
Love this place. Staff is so friendly  food is great pricing is good.  Down side - Always a kong line and lots of flys
Love the ambiance of this place.  Super casual.  Consistently good food.  I love the asian chicken salad and the fried green beans.  The breakfast tacos are great too.
They have a large menu and a great selection of gluten free options. The portion sizes are large. We will be back for sure. Great place!. . The only downer was the flys buzzing around. We sat inside and they were annoying.
We have been coming to this place for several years and we keep waiting for it to improve and it never really does. The food is just "ok" and we really only come here because there is a large grassy area where kids can run around and play while you wait for your food. This is a huge draw because it takes the stress out of having to keep your kids corraled the entire time. We've had the chicken tenders (strange), fish (ok), grilled cheese (the best thing we've had here), corn dogs, the BBQ platters (dry) and several other things in between. It's not that the food is bad....it's just not good - it's OK.. . Our kids love to come and run around with other kids and that is the only thing that keeps us coming back.
Hands down the best burgers I have ever had. The Fontina Burger is to die for and even the fries are fantastic.  The pizzas are fresh, crisp and very flavorful. The Fried Green Beans are also a favorite of mine, but only indulge if you have unconditionally loving friends and family around because it will give you garlic breath that could take the paint off of walls.  My husband likes the more traditional Farm Burger, Jumbo Fried Shrimp and Onion Rings. You really can't go wrong with anything you get here. The food is high quality, fantastic flavor, giant portions and the prices are great! My husband and I frequented this place on a weekly basis while we lived in the area for 2 years. Do yourself a favor and eat here.
