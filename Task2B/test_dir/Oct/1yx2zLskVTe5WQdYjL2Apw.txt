Awesome breakfast I had incredible huevos rancheros  and a biscuit with gravy. Yummy. Everyone in my party loved their breakfast. Huge portions I only ate half. Karla gave us wonderful service. If you are visiting Vegas a must place to have breakfast!!
5 Stars for service!  Especially Amanda who is so sweet!  . . For the food, I give it 3 stars, for good not great. . . However I did order something unusual and perhaps the other dishes are better.  I ordered a Hawaiian dish that was supposed to have sticky white rice, but it was just ordinary white rice.  The pancakes were a little under cooked.
Amazing customer service as well as food. On our veryfirst visit there was a problem with my order. Not only did our waitress not hesitate to bring me something else, they did it quickly AND brought us a free "gift to take home" - an entire loaf of yummy banana bread! I was pretty blown away by how nice they were to us.  They go out of their way to make sure you leave with a smile on your face. I wish all restaurants had customer service like this place. We loved the food as well and will definitely be back for more.
Great little gem in Vegas! Whenever I'm in town I always make a stop here for a quality breakfast. This time, our server Karla, was great. She brought our drinks and food out quickly. She didn't was attentive and did not rush us. My boyfriend left his sunglasses at the table and when we went up to pay she brought them right up to him. This place is a must when your in town or looking for great food with a decent price.
We Ate at Egg and I.  I had the fiesta scramble and changed the eggs to over medium and added sausage. They took my adjustments in stride.  Ashley was our server.  Great service and yummy breakfast.
In love with the potatoes for breakfast, well seasoned and don't even need Ketchup if you ask me. That's a first : D
Came to breakfast with a large group while in Vegas for a Birthday trip. It was so nice to eat off the strip and have a great cooked meal. Everyone in my party loved their dishes. I had Eggs Benedict, which was wonderful. . . Why I rated it a 4... server wasn't great. She was nice, friendly, and polite but wasn't real attentive. We had a long wait to have our order taken too. The coffee... was not drinkable. I love coffee w my breakfast food so that was kinda a disappointment but the Eggs Benedict made up for it!!
Food is awesome and our server Chance was awesome! Strawberry cream cheese french toast is a nice thing to share.
In search of that last good meal before heading back to California, I decided to give The Egg and I a try due to recommendation of a family member.  Yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  The wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  I tried the waffle works, which consisted of a huge Belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  I did request whipped cream on the waffle, which made it taste even better.  The waffle was huge.  I enjoyed every bite.  The portions were very generous for the price.  Worth every penny.  The server Lindsey was wonderful and made sure I had the meal of a lifetime.  . .      The Egg and I taught me a lesson that the best places to eat are not always on the Strip or Downtown Las Vegas.  There are good places to eat all over Las Vegas and you have to dig deep into your soul for the best food possible.  The Egg and I has a small town feel to it which provides an intimate dining experience.  This is one of the few places in Las Vegas you can eat at everyday and not get tired of it but wouldn't do so simply due to the fact that you don't want to spoil yourself.  This will become my new go-to spot in need of a good breakfast while visiting.  As far as the food quality and atmosphere goes. the Egg and I destroys Denny's and IHOP by all leaps and bounds imaginable.
Great bang for your buck. Carole Ann was our waitress and she was epic.. we had the French toast and the sunrise mountain. Both were good. Lots of food so heads up. The vanilla capinchino is quite sweet but yummy !!! Overall great. Would come again.
The Egg & I! If I could eat at one place for breakfast every day of my life, it would be this place. Granted, I've only been here once, but I can't stop thinking about the delicious food I ate and how I wish we had this place in LA. . . I ordered the Chili Relleno omelet and the Country Benny. They had the option of ordering smaller portions of the skillets and omelet dishes which I really enjoyed because the portions were fairly large and I unfortunately can never finish my food, no matter how hard I try.. . The Chili Relleno was so extremely flavorful, the omelet practically melted in my mouth. And the Country Benny, the gravy, the sausage, the biscuit... Mmmm! My eyes rolled back with every bite. I wanted to order the banana pancakes but I think I was getting ahead of myself. . . Our waitress, Carla, was amazing. She was very helpful and attentive, and definitely made my experience more enjoyable.. . I will go to Vegas again just to eat here. Can't wait to come back!
If you are really hungry for a big breakfast, this place is the spot!  Incredible portions and the banana my muffins....OMG....the banana nut muffins...!
I was reading the yelp reviews and maybe just hyped up myself that this was going to be mouthgasmic. The food was good and from what I can tell so far is that it's better than IHOP or Denny's.
My ritual before heading home. I head to Egg and I and have a breakfast feast. I enjoyed everything that I have tasted there. From fried eggs to the pancakes to the seasoned potatoes. It has a very homey feeling. . . It is nice to get away from the strip and get used to life outside of Vegas before heading back home. I love the staff here. Super nice!
good food, loved the breakfast selection
We always come to the Egg & I when we are in Vegas!  Today was no exception. Lindsey served us an amazing breakfast. We love your selection and especially the spinach Benny.
Went here because of the great reviews, and was not disappointed. Long line out front, but surprisingly only waited 15 min for a table. Food was excellent. Lindsey our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back on my next trip!
As always great service.  Our server Amanda is great and always has a smile on her face. Love coming back
We came here with high hopes because of all the choices, loved the potatoes. The coffee had a burnt taste so we asked for a fresh pot but it still took 3 sugars to make it drinkable. The skillet my wife had with the Portuguese sausage seemed over salted and gave her a stomach ache and sent her to the bathroom several times. Our waitress was forgetfull and not very knowledgeable about the menu.  We probably wont be back for a while as long as the Omelet house is still in business. Sorry Eggs & I
As long as you like eggs, this is great! They have few non egg choices, but a plethora of egg creations!. . I had their breakfast burrito (scraped out of its tortilla -no gluten for me ). It was very good. In retrospect I would just get a skillet but I was starving and not thinking clearly with all the choices! . . I went on a Saturday morning and even though it was crowded, it felt like the wait was fine. The staff is friendly and was obviously working very hard to be quick yet still friendly. I enjoyed this place.
First time here, loved the foods and customer service was great. Chance she is a great waitress I do appreciate the hard work and for a great service.
Came to Vegas to celebrate my boyfriends 21st birthday.. And today we go back home :( but before we leave we decided to track down an awesome place for breakfast to keep us going for the ride back! My boyfriend chose this place because of all the great reviews he saw on Yelp. And we weren't disappointed! The omelette was so cheesy and delicious and my tuna melt was perfect! The seasoned fries and breakfast potatoes were awesome too! Lily was our server and she was super sweet and brought us whatever we needed right away. We will be making it a tradition whenever we come out here to eat at the Egg & I! Thank you!! Now for the drive home..... :( lol
This place was delicious! I loved it can't wait to go back next time I visit vegas!!! Yummy
