Good value lots of locals. I think the Seafood buffet was not that great but the food is good on any of their other parts.  Ice cream is very good, . Lunch is my favorite here, also there is beer and wine.. . Tail soup is delicious, sometimes they have lamb and great prime rib.. . Get Sambucca in your Cappucino and a shot on the side.
Always delicious choices.  Great variety.  Lines usually very long unless you have a line pass.  Employees very nice.  A little pricey on weekends unless you have a free coupon.  Desserts my favorite.  Creme brullet to die for.
Our go-to local buffet. It's clean and spacious and the food are all well seasoned & cooked. Check out their dessert counter...excellent selections!!! Great customer service as well.
The food is fabulous. Got my fill of hummus and pita before delving into Italian and Asian cuisine. The dessert bar is awesome. Espressos and cappuccinos, along with gelato and ice cream. The carrot cake is the bomband well as all of their bakery delights. My hubby enjoyed the prime rib. I based the price on the lunch buffet. The dinner buffet is 3 stars as far as the price is concerned. A must-stop on every trip to Vegas.
This used to be one of the stand out buffets in town. It has been slowly going downhill. . . I went today for lunch and to my dismay, they have totally gutted their dessert station.  . . Where they once had unique and sometimes very good desserts, they now have a few items that seem like they have been shipped in and the dessert shelves are literally sitting empty.  Now they offer just the gelato, a few cookies, brownies, and a few other items. Gone are the hot chocolatecakes, the creme brulee, the flan, the crepes, the chocolates...all the things that made their desserts one of the better ones in town. . . A lot of their food still looks good but the taste of their food has been slowly getting worse. Their meatballs used to be some of the best in town and now it is so tough as to be inedible.  I think they have been replacing higher cost ingredients with lower cost ones and it is getting to the point that it is really noticeable. . . I used to regularly travel here from the other side of town to enjoy the buffet and their casino. But with the slow slide down and the recent gutting of their desserts, I doubt I will be back anytime soon. . . If I want grocery level cookies and gelato and really cheap ingredients, I can go to any of the super cheap buffets in town closer to home.
Several things that I liked about this buffet.. . 1.  Cheap.  Lunch price is $15.99, which isn't bad at all considering the quality. . . 2.  Free wine, Bud Light, and hard cider.  Can't beat that.. . 3.  Since it's so out in the middle of nowhere, easy to get in and out.. . 4.  Selection was very good.  Things I recommend - sashimi salad, oxtail soup, pork ribs, creme brule, fried Pollack. . . . . Things that were meh.. . 1.  The line was short when I arrived at 12:50 with a party of five.  But it took 30 minutes to get seated.  It wasn't packed, so they slow the flow down since there must be a limited number of servers, not because of a limited number of tables.. . 2.  The price is right, but still no local or military discount.  However, I'm fairly certain that 80% of the people eating were Clark County types.. . 3.  That pumpkin ice cream was unedible.. . Just asked my son what he liked - Korean kalbi ribs and the mac and cheese.  He said he didn't like the pistachio shots, flan, and tamales.  He's 18 and jobless so he shouldn't be so picky.
I really want to give this place more stars but I really can't. Don't get me wrong, the place is beautiful with it's screen tvs above the buffet, the buffet setup, the food but a few things that bothered me. The wait to get in was ridiculous! There were visible empty tables yet it took almost an hour to get in!
The price, taste, and service can not be beat. You will not be disappointed.
I'm still in love with this buffet. $ 39.99 for the dinner seafood buffet. U will enjoy each bite!  Can I get a complimentary buffet already?
Hands down the BEST buffet in Vegas. I am comparing them with the Wynn, Bellagio and Caesar Palace. . First, their price is awesome. Because we are from Cali they gave us a $5 off per person for dinner so it ends up around $35 per for Sat dinner. . Second, all you can drink wine and beer! The buffet comes with free wine and beer which is unheard of. Other buffet will charge you $12.99 for the same quality.. Third, food selection is wonderful. Weekends are seafood buffet but for someone who can't eat seafood they still have an awesome selection. Did I mention they have roast lamb?! The juicy rosemary roast lamb itself is worth the price. Their quality of food is as good as any buffet on the strip. . If you have time to drive 15 mins out of the strip, this is the place you should try.. . * Had their breakfast one other time and they really made a good impression by filing every station with delicious food, love this place.. . Waiting time: Sat dinner at 6pm, waited for 5 minutes to get seated. You can't find that anywhere else on the strip. Sunday breakfast waited 15 minutes but still worth it!!!
Excellent choice for a seafood buffet in Vegas....a bit of a locals option as it is actually located in Henderson.  So many choices of seafood to choose from with the crab legs being the clear showcase item on the night we visited.  In addition, they also had a great selection of other proteins, pasta, salads, and an amazing assortment of desserts.  Try this while in the Vegas area! Free wine or beer included in the price.
Yes free beer & wine all you can eat buffets where can you find :). The food was okay probably will not come back!
One of the best buffet out of the strip. Hands down!!!. Very fancy. We came on the weekday and we got the deal $16.99 I believe.. . I enjoyed their entrees. They have different varieties of food from Asian, Italian, Mexican, American food. Prime ribs, crawfish, crab legs, diff types of seafood, sushi, you name it all.. . I love their dessert!!! They got everything and it all looks appetizing.. . Don't forget to order some wine Pinot Noir ;-) and I also got some caramel latte on the side. I was probably drinking from 3-4 glasses. . . I really enjoyed it here. The atmosphere is exquisite. Very modern. Staff were great! Food was DELICIOUS. . . Now I'm done.
