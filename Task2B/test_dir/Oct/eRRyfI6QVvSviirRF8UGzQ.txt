Always a stunning experience - the East Side lounge is the best lounge I have been to in 10 years.
Absolutely awesome on every level. The nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Can't say enough great things about it. Will be coming back.
Get ready for awesome views, great concierge, pools and drinks. . . The staff from front desk to the security guards were extremely friendly. The junior suite I stayed in was immensely clean and spacious. . . The gym offers complimentary water and there's a bar for protein/health shakes. All equipment is top of the line and there a plenty of machines so you won't have to wait. . . It's on the quiet end of the strip but it's right across from the Fashion Show Mall if you're big on shopping like I am. . . Steve Wynn has a great art collection throughout the hotel as well. Blown glass chandeliers, peacocks made of of lights, Jeff Koons sculptures oh my! . . Whether you're staying 4 nights or a week, a hold on your charge card will be placed for your entire stay (plus incidentals), which I wasn't aware of.
Just landed. Staff is amazing, place is so clean. Amazing food options, good bars. It was really cool to walk around and not be hammered and notice all of the intricate detail at the property. The spa is beyond incredible. Make sure to do the suggested rehab cycle....shower, steam, dry sauna, whirlpool, cool plunge ice plunge then pass out on warming chair.. . Bring money to spend everything is expensive but well worth it. I lost money gambling but the experience was worth it.
The only place I'll stay in Vegas. Of all the casinos I've visited (Cosmopolitan included) this place has the most class. The decor is stunning. Lush red ceilings, gold chandeliers, and beautiful floral carpeting. Somehow  achieves the casino feel without bathing the room in darkness. The well-lit interior really lends itself to making friends (and good for them, staying up later gambling). Also, in my opinion, XS is the best of the Vegas clubs. Though XS is in the Wynn part, staying at hotel will get you reduced entrance to both before midnight. Go in, get stamped, then head back out to pregame/gamble.. . Take me back to vegas
Great hotel.  Appreciate the "boutique" feel.  Small casino without poker room. . Really nice rooms.  Nice amenities.. Would come back over Venetian.  Less kids ( I have 2--but took a break).
Beautiful hotel, grounds, pools, decor... everything.  I havent stayed here as of yet but I have at The Wynn and I'm sure Encore being newer is just as top-notch as its predecessor. I did have a good friend that used to work here and she showed me around. I especially liked the pools including the european style pools. Yes, guests can go topless. No, it's not like going to the Playboy Mansion and what you would expect hanging out at Hef's infamous grotto. It was the middle of summer and it was mostly older folks. I didnt hang around long enough to be traumatized. I was fine with the other pools. They are immaculate and service is great. . . Surrender is located inside Encore and is a great layout for a club that attracts some of the most well-known DJs from all over the world. It's a big club with a big a space that includes the pools of Encore Beach Club.. . Taxi line can be such a long wait here. Valet is efficient but their pick-up/drop-off area is so congested and unclear that during the height of summer, it can be such a mess. . . Will update my review once I've been an official guest here.
What can I say about hotel room service? It is what it is. At the Encore, prices are just as ridiculous as any other hotel on the strip. The thing I love about it is the convenience and laziness of it all. There's just something about sitting on my ass in my hotel room and hearing *knock knock* 'room service.' I equate it to having pizza delivered to your house, except you're in a hotel room during an adventurous trip instead of merely in your house.  . . The food was standard, nothing special. I got mini sliders and a French onion soup. I've had better. Wasn't terrible, just nothing spectacular. My wife had a sandwich and fries. . . The guy who delivered it was nice enough (making the usual chit chat, where are you guys from and so on). Gave him his tip and he was on his way. . . Basically the food and service were ok. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. It was exactly what I'd expect, and nothing more.. . After eating, what else is there to do but go back downstairs and hit the tables!
This review would absolutely be 5 stars if it weren't for an issue we experienced with housekeeping and then with the front desk staff. Housekeeping entered our room without knocking or announcing themselves while we were asleep and the privacy light was illuminated on our door. It scared us to death. I called the front desk immediately, then stopped by the front desk two times during our stay to inquire/follow up on the issue. All staff members (3 in total) I spoke with said there were no notes on file about this issue, but they would each personally ensure they speak with the floor manager and get back to me. That never happened. It was so unfortunate that both housekeeping and the front desk staff showed such poor customer service, especially since all other aspects of our stay were incredible. I will be going back to The Palazzo for future trips to Vegas.
Encore is a beautiful hotel. One feels like they are in the most luxurious accommodations, when interacting with the employees, and enjoying panoramic views. Although the amenities were top notch, I was annoyed  by the loud music from XS.  I could hear every word of the songs and bass on the 52nd floor at 2AM.   I understand this is Vegas, but I have never experienced this much noise at this hotel on a high floor. In fact  I went out to play slots because I could not sleep , and the noise outside of XS was not as loud as outside my window! Not sure what was going on this night. but I would have been irate if I was on a lower floor.
The Encore is our favorite place to stay and play in Las Vegas. This place really puts the rest of the strip to shame. And if you do get tired of the Encore, the Wynn and the Palazzo are all you need to add some variety. The buffet was the best I've been to, and their cafe has an amazing pumpkin cheesecake. The pool was beautiful and the Eastside lounge is a great place to have a smoke.
