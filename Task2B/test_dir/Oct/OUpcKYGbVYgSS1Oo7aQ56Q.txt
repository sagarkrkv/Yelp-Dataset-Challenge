OMG this place  is fantastic.  The room is wonderful, modern roomy, super comfy, I think this is where I want to stay everytime I come to Vegas from now on.  I have wanted to stay here for quite some time, and this time we decided to do it, and I am NOT DISAPPOINTED.
I cant really say I'm a fan because I've only stayed there once and barely. Their parking lot is great, it's multi level and if you stay at the hotel, parking is free. I love their shampoo, conditioner and lotion, it was so light (yes, typical asian) . . 6--(o0,)--6. . Their rooms are clean and spacious. The only thing I hated about the hotel room was the airconditioner. For some darned reason, it rattled whenever I try to lower the temperature below 70 degrees. Also, whenever I flushed the toilet, it made the same sound as a firetruck. It's just weird.. . Got a deal with HW so no issue with the price.
First let me say that this is not the first time we've stayed at the Golden Nugget. Everything has gone incrementally downhill since the first time we stayed here, but we decided to give it one last go.. . This trip was to celebrate my Mother in laws birthday. I called the hotel directly almost two months in advance. We needed to make sure we got a handicap accessible room preferably with a roll in shower, as my Mom can't stand to get get out of her chair, and has to transfer over to do anything outside of her chair. . . We were informed that they only had FOUR handicap accessible rooms with a roll in shower but they all had king beds. (Do they not take into consideration that some disabled people would like to not have to share a bed with their traveling companions?) They said we could have a roll away cot brought in for the third person. As it was my Mom, my husband and myself we needed 2 beds. Making someone sleep on a ROLL AWAY COT for FOUR days of a VACATION was unacceptable to me for the amount of money we were paying for the room. So we compromised and booked a room they said was also handicap accessible, that had two double beds but a regular bathtub that we could use a shower chair in.  I thought that would be ok as long as it was truly accessible, so we booked the room.. . Upon arrival, we waited in line for about 20 minutes while we waited for one of only 2 clerks working the check in. There were about 18 people behind us and about 5 people in front of us when we got there. After getting to the check in desk, we were informed that there were NO handicap rooms with double beds available at all (even though we booked this room two months prior.) The desk clerk finally got her supervisor and he found a room that was handicap accessible with two double beds. So up to our room we went.. . Although our room did have two double beds thats about all I can say about it. First, the beds were too high. I mean they were even high for able bodied people. When you can't use your legs, the only ways to get into bed are to transfer evenly from your chair to the bed. This can only be accomplished if the bed is even or just slightly (1 or 2 inches) above or below the seat on the chair. They other was is kind of degrading. You either have to have someone pick you up and put you in the bed (which wouldn't have happened in this instance), or have someone push you by your behind while your are yanking on the sheets hoping that the housekeeper tucked them in nice and tight, while you pull yourself over the bed. We ended up taking the bed and box spring off the frame and putting the bed and box spring on the floor.. . The toilet was low....I mean knees-up-around-my-ears-when-I-sat-down-on-it low. So we called to ask if they had a riser for the loo. What they brought didn't really work. It had plastic bolts on the side so that it would tighten down. Well it didn't. The first time she tried to transfer over, the riser slid nearly off the toliet. So for the whole trip, any time she had to go ( that we were in our room) , I had to hold onto the damn handles attached to the seat. Not to mention the not-helpful-at-all-to-someone-who-can't-use-their-legs grab bar that is bolted to the floor. There was also no room for her to turn around in her wheelchair for the bathroom. She doesn't even have a big chair. Its a little racing chair.. . How they thought this room is handicap accessible shows a shocking lack of knowledge in the ADA laws and requirements not to mention a serious lack of training for the front line staff. With more and more customers requiring special needs accommodations it would benefit the Golden Nugget greatly to do a little research and fix the problems with the rooms so that their less spry customers can enjoy their stay as much as their able bodied friends.  . . The only reason this review got two stars instead on only on is the service in the poker room. They were very friendly and accommodating when my Mom wanted to play in a no limit poker tourney. . . Unfortunately, the nice guys in the poker room were not enough. We will no longer be staying at the Golden Nugget and will NOT recommend them to anyone.
The Golden Nugget will officially be my preferred hotel when I return to Vegas. The room was very nice and clean. The Grille was really good. The pool was amazing. Everything I experienced was fantastic. I don't care about drinking or gambling so this place was perfect. Mere minutes from Fremont st was also great since I had a concert at the LVCS. I love the Golden Nugget and will be a Fan for life.
Room has a kinda old look and feel. $12 for 4 K Cups?  Really?   . . Probably the nicest hotel downtown, but that's like saying you are the tallest midget. (pardon my non-pc terminology).
Once again we had an amazing time in Vegas and enjoyed every minute of our Golden Nugget stay.   We had another room in the Carson tower and this one had more modern decor than last year.   The pool is amazing and we spent every day swimming and going down the water slide like little kids.  I love everything about this hotel from the friendly employees to the restaurants to being right in the middle of Fremont Street.  This hotel is extremely classy without being gaudy and over-the-top like some other places.   See you next year, GN!
We only stayed here because my husband had to for work. It's not a place I would've picked myself. It's old and needs updating and even the Rush Tower which has been updated needs updating! The tub was nice and the bed was alright for a hotel bed but I wouldn't stay here again. The staff was not very helpful. The valet is THE WORST! They never have enough valet staff and even when they do they are all just standing around. One night we drove up and there was a line outside the valet. Cars were just parked in the valet line with no one moving them and my husband waited 20-30 mins for someone just to show up. The pool was always over crowded so we didn't even attempt that! The only thing good about this hotel was Lillie's restaurant. The hibachi was very good. Unfortunately this is probably the best hotel on Freemont Street and that's not saying a lot.
My family and I stopped in to grab some food, see the pool, play a few slots.  The food was food.  Not terrible and not the best thing on the world. The pool was great.  I love seeing the shark tank! The staff was super polite.  One employee noticed my mother in law walking slowly with a cane an offered a wheel chair.  It was nice to see staff that seemed human.  We were unable to get a wheel chair at some of the larger casinos where it was necessary due to the size of the places and the distance. Between exhibits and statues. Golden nugget went above and beyond to please.
This hotel is nicer than most of the older hotels on the strip. I was very impressed with the room and service here. The only reason I am giving the hotel 4 stars is that it took 45 minutes to check in and the Italian food place in the hotel's portions are smaller than kids meals for $20+ a plate.
I will never go back there. I found a cockroach in the bathroom. They did upgrade us to a lovely suite for free but I'll never trust the cheap rooms ever again. Disgusting!! We tried the buffet and it was only ok.
My fifth time at this hotel. I took a gold tower pool view room thinking I would not get any noise late at night. I was wrong. I don't know if the loud music was from the pool area or Fremont street but it lasted until around 3 am. If I decide to stay here again I will make sure I'm in a room that doesn't have any noise late at night.. One of the big reasons I will consider staying here again is the Hideout Pool.. Great food in the new restaurants.
Stayed here Friday through Monday $118 Friday and Saturday night with a wedding discount and $75 for Sunday.  I thought that was quite high for downtown.  There is no resort fee but you also don't get anything like wifi.  Rooms are not renovated but they claim to have new Serta mattresses.  The casino has been renovated with new tables, chandeliers, and furniture.  I tried to go sit by the infamous pool on Sunday but there wasn't a single lounge chair.  I think they allow non-hotel guests into the pool area.
The hotel and casino is nice. The staff seemed friendly and they have a good amount of bars to lounge. However, our room (in the Carson towers) was horrible. The "smoke free" room smelled like an ashtray . The shower didn't work. The room looked old and outdated. There wasn't anything nice about it. They did give is a free late check out which was nice. I guess you get what you pay for .
Very disappointed with the booking process. We did not get the room we requested, because they had given it away or something happen with the reservation. So we paid the same price we were quoted for the Gold Tower Deluxe and then paid for water, wifi and and coffee. Really?  We're Total Rewards Diamond Members and could have had a room free on the Strip, but wanted the experience of staying downtown with our friends to share in their wedding reception . We called to voice our concerns and "they were sorry". I'll make sure we do our gambling across the street at the Four Queens and the D. You stuck it to us and we will stick it to you. Oh, "we're sorry too", because this was a stupid mistake that could have been easily rectified.   With service like this, you should be ashamed of your customer service policies.
Stayed at the Golden Nugget for four nights and was really impressed by the modern feel of this hotel. All the other hotels in Downtown felt a little older due to the renovations that took place at the Golden Nugget. Our room was fit for four people but had full size beds, we were expecting the typical queen beds. The bathrooms were nice but the bedroom felt a little older. Service and quality of the hotel was great and would recommend staying here if you're downtown! Also the parking situation was great! Easy and very accessible.
I've experienced better, The Golden Nugget lost its class in my opinion and tried to create an atmosphere that doesn't work from the minute you step in - and lug your suitcase down the stairs (no ramp to be found anywhere).   It once was a beautiful spot to stay, and our favorite hotel downtown, when the walls were creamy white with gold accents throughout the hotel.  Back when the ceiling was high so that it wasn't like walking through a dark dense smoke cloud as it is now.  My clothing reeked daily because it was so stinky smoky, and although the rooms are labeled non-smoking, the ventilation system cannot screen out the smoke smell.  . . We asked for a quiet room and was assigned a "mountain" facing room (in other words, facing Fremont St.) #18206 by the most unfriendly desk clerk ever.  She didn't say a word, it was obvious she was having a bad day.  We entered the Rush Tower room, and it was so dark and dank we could hardly see, even after turning on every light.  Dark brown black and brown interior with a tub/shower combo that is difficult to step in & out of because the tracking is so high.  Light comes out at you from the mirror above the sinks which make it impossible to see anything-horrible lighting.  Door to room sticks and is difficult to shut, you have to really slam the doors or risk it staying open.  You can hear every sound from the people above you, beside you and the clanging of the staff - not sure what was making all the noise coming from the walls.  TV channels were very limited, maybe 5 or so?  Picture did not come in very well.  The room was dark, dark, dark, did I say the room & hotel was dark?  The fun began when we came in our room from the casino after a ten hour drive that morning ready to sleep at 9pm - impossible -  the music from Fremont street was blasting & vibrating through our room, it was hard to even hear the TV.  What a BAD design plan.  I called down to the front desk and was informed it would quit at 11pm.  Ugh.  It ended finally around 11:30pm but the noise lingered until 1am.  Next morning we asked to switch rooms.  Our next room, not ready until late afternoon was much, much better noise-wise.  Everything else was exactly the same except for maybe a sliver more light coming through the window & a much better view of the strip.  Charges for the coffee & water in room-tacky.  Nice shampoo, soaps, etc.  Bed was pretty comfortable.. . Food-wise they took out our once favorite cafe that served great quality food and added Claim Jumper, a chain restaurant (who wants a chain restaurant, is that the best they could do?) and The Grotto which has horrible pizza.  The whole smoky vibe is bad, even when you venture toward the only light in the casino, near the pool, to see the poor sea creatures contained in a too small aquarium at the pool-with chairs packed so close that it is impossible to squeeze a leg between to lay down on one.  Awful.  Vic and Anthony's was delicious, that is about the best I can say from a food perspective.  . . The downtown vibe is great if you like porn in your face every time you venture from the hotel, Fremont street is gross.  We won't be back to this hotel.
This hotel is good for what it is. It's feels like an older hotel. Everyone is nice and it is cool going out to the strip on the way to life is beautiful festival. The best thing about it is the price. If you book early enough you can get a decent price especially if you split the room. Overall it was a pleasurable experience but not the caliber of the big hotels.
A great place to stay and play! They have some of the nicest hotel rooms in the downtown area. Even though it's an older casino, the rooms are newly decorated and modern. They have a great pool with a water slide that goes through a large fish tank. It's nice to sit at the pool and watch the fish. I've also had some luck gambling here as well. I've eaten at both Grotto and Chart House and I recommend both. They both have excellent food.
I love downtown Vegas, and this is the perfect hotel. Very friendly staff. Clean modern rooms. Great food selections. Gratto is my favorite. The best people watching and the best gambling in Vegas. Tip the front desk to be upgraded to a suite.
First time in Vegas but loved this place! Right in the middle of Fremont Street so you are close to everything. The room was nice for a decent price. We stayed in the gold tower which is older than the rush tower but still loved it! :)
This place is horrible.. The employees are especially rude. I called ahead of time making sure we would be able to go in the pool we had no issues they assured us. We traveled long ways to get here and the old man said very rudely and mockingly ha this is only for guests and closed on weekends (and just to let you know Friday is not considered a weekend) so we were super upset and to top it all off who told you that we were open to public the concierge? He said you shouldn't listen to them! What it's your hotel not mine!!!! If you know this is happening why don't you change they way your people say things that are not accurate! Horrible horrible horrible... I will never return again oh btw this was for my bachelorette with a lot of girls so they missed on a lot of customers.
