Here is something cool to check out in Vegas...and it is free.. . We were sightseeing in Vegas.  Most of the hotels have their own theme so they are all neat to check out.  We went by the Bellagio.  Outside the Bellagio the fountains light up and dance.  We kept missing it and finally were able to catch it.  It is an absolutely beautiful sight to see.
Reviewing the fountains?  Sure, why not!  Let's get pumped up for next weekend's Vegas vacation!. . What can be said about the fountains?  It's free, there's a show every 30 minutes, and they're always updating the accompanying music.  It's gorgeous during the day and even more lovely at night.  To ensure a good spot, get there 10 minutes early and stand around.  Once the fountains goes off, everybodyand their moms will be crowding you for a prime viewing spot.  Watching it from Paris, your room at Bellagio, or the balcony at Cosmopolitan gives you a different view than when you're standing next to it.. . Bellagio is known for their fountains and The Strip isn't the same without them.  You can miss the volcano show at Mirage and skip the pirate show at Treasure Island but make sure you stop and watch The Fountains at Bellagio!  Am I the only one that imagines how painful it must be to be blasted by one of those fountains?
Long running and still standing fountain show.  Streams of high powered dancing water cannons shoot and sway in the air.  Timed to classical, vintage Vegas and patriotic music the spectacle can be seen from the strip directly in front of Bellagio or viewed on the street or from the valet fountain viewing areas.  Whenever you're done blowing the kids college funds on the 1 armed bandits or blowing your wad at the strip clubs, it's nice to get something for free right?
The fountains never cease to amaze me. The show changes pretty frequently, as we saw the fountains 3 days in a row and the movement as well as the music was different every day. There's really no horrible vantage point to see them, but I think across the street might be a little better, as you can see more of the show at one time.
Love this place, the show was beautiful! We had alot of fun. It does not hurt that it is free and always on a schedule. It is definitely worth it to stop and check the show out!
