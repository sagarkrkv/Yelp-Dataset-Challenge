What does a girl need to do to get a corkscrew around here? It's my second night staying here for a conference. I've been waiting nearly an hour for a corkscrew. Just a corkscrew. I even called back after about 20 minutes to check on it... "It should be coming up soon!" . . Update: It took about 45 minutes. Additionally, some of the minibar items are not restocked. When I got back to my room after house keeping visited, the bathroom TV was pulled away from the wall and facing the room, and an unopened soap bar on the counter had been removed. So they were watching TV while cleaning, which is fine, but they should put the items back in their proper places after the fact. Why'd you take the soap? So weird.. . My room key has stopped working 3 times now, which has been strange. I think maybe the card reader on the door needs a little cleaning? It always works downstairs at the elevator bank, but then suddenly does not work at the room. Hopefully third time's the charm!. . On the flip side, the pool is beautiful, the view (at least from my side of the building) is also beautiful, and the bathtub is spacious. Bed is definitely comfortable, but I agree with another yelper who stated they are too short. I checked out happy hour at Lucille's this evening and that was great. Called room service last night for dinner, which was prompt (much earlier in the evening, about 5:30pm) and tasty. The bars here are nice and the servers are polite enough. Concierge ladies were quite helpful today, and the shuttle driver was nice. Overall it's a very, very pretty resort. If you want to be a little removed from the chaotic strip, this is a good option.. . Weird: The fitness center closes at 7pm. Why???
Must go back and highly recommend!
I don't really care for the buffet here compared to the cook to order Philly cheese steaks you get at Green Valley Ranch.  But it's a pretty casino & I almost never have luck on this place.  Too many games to choose from makes it harder to find a good paying machine. If you're interested myVEGAS is offering a FREE comp basic room here.

I must say I had a great time here on May 30th for my boyfriends birthday staycation. I had tix to see The Fray poolside, and thought it would be cool to just get a room and stay the night after. I was impressed with the room. It was a standard room with a pool view which was nice. They actually have about 12 pools in total! The bed was soo comfortable! The bathroom was large and modern! It had a big tub and double sinks and a separate room with a door that had the toilet. We ate that night at the buffet and it was just ok. All Station casino buffets taste the same to me. They have a ton more restaurants including Mexican, Japanese, BBQ, a cafe, food court and more. They also have a movie theater and a bowling alley. Tons of stuff to do. I would most definitely stay here again.
stayed at Red Rock this past weekend, and while the room and grounds were very nice, the service was lackluster for the price and 4star AAA review.. . Sitting down at one of the bars watching the Dodger game while playing the little video poker machine, this particularly "I hate my life" type bartender charged me $12 for the 2 beers I ordered us, and I've never been charged for drinks while gambling anywhere in vegas (or anywhere else in this casino). That kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Then as we were retreating to the room, we tried to walk across the lounge/pool area to the elevator that was immediately next to our room (since this place only has one general elevator like an 1/8th mile away on the other side of the resort, and was stopped by a security guard. We obviously weren't trying to go swimming in our lounge attire, but he made us walk twice as far all the way around the building. Finally, on a sunday, they wouldn't even grant a 1 hour late checkout, nor would they answer at the desk to allow checkout by phone. I had to go downstairs and wait 15 minutes in line to leave. Bottom line, the place is nice, but the staff doesn't do a damn thing to be accommodating, I'll never come back, for being so far off the strip it offers nothing to necessitate the additional 20 minutes of travel time, or price tag.
Great hotel, awesome pool, fabulous restaurants and very kid friendly! My 6 year old loved the tv in the bathtub. We will definitely stay there again.
I came out here for a peaceful weekend. With my family. When we got here bell desk, valet and check in where awesome! The pool area is another story, I literally asked 4 times for a beer we sat there for over 2hrs no one ever asked if we wanted something to drink or eat. As we saw waiters running back and forth to take care of what I'm guessing are more important guest. I then approached a guy and said can I get a beer?? He said yea never came back, I walked over to the bar found him 30 min later and said can I have that beer now?? He said my bad and I finally got me one. Then 30 min later I waived down 2 other waitresses that told me it's not there area and said they would get someone for me. That person came 15 min later without an apology or even a smile. I don't know what the deal is, being a minority and seeing every bobby, Todd and Trevor get there food and orders right away makes me sick to my stomach. I love the hotel but things like this remind me of how people will always treat what they perceive as more important by the color of there skin, fyi red rock staff I probably have more money and tip better than the people u are kissing up to
Came for a conference.    The grounds and facilities are great, but I can only give it two stars, and here is the reason.  . . If you need to work while you are here, don't count on it.  The cell phone service is non existent. The wifi is available, but not much better.  I ended up leaving during the conference to get cell service and Internet access down the street. . . In 2014, cell service and good wifi are a must.  The Red Rock folks, need to put as much attention to these amenities as they do the rest of the resort.. . I won't come back, or recommend you stay here if you plan on using your devices at all.
Red Rock is one of my favorite.. Well it's my only favorite locals casino! Prior to Aliante no longer being my favorite stations casino RED ROCK has now defaulted to being the only! This is a great hotel for locals to play that live around the Summerlin Area! Very conveniently located off of Charleston/ 215! I have gambled as well as played here and every experience including the movie theatershave been very pleasant! Always a plus to have such great hospitality as well as a clean facility to go to just to hang out!
I absolutely love Red Rock. Not just the casino, but the fun for the entire family. Dining, Movies, bowling, arcade, and Kids Quest. . . When my husband and I want to spend some quality time (lol) at the poker or blackjack table, or play some video games (aka slots) this it the casino to go. We drop the kids off at kids quest and off we go. Kids Quest is a licensed day care and is tax deductible! Ask for a print out at the end of the year to get child care tax credit when filing taxes. . . The atmosphere is awesome. Many locals and dealers know each other by name. Or maybe we just come too often?!! We often get comps for dining or the hotel stay for out of state family and friends in addition to weekly free bets and free play.
Take a beautiful 5 star look and have motel 6 people manage it. Thats what we got. Bathroom ceiling started pouring water at 2:30am, we called the front desk and engineering came up. After weighing out the options we decided to take our chances and stay in that room, mostly because it was now 3am. Engineering guy said it happens Ll of the time and he would talk to management about taking care of us. 10 minutes after he left security came and asked if engineering came. I said yes and asked her why didn't she ask engineering if they came instead if inconveniencing the guest? Another 15 minutes later the security girl came back with "head of security" insisting they come in because they needed to file a report. At that point I was clearly frustrated with a self touting head of security awkwardly talking to my wife while she is in bed at 3am. I asked him why they didn't make their report based on the engineers observation seeing how he was not trained or responsible for evaluating such situations. Needless to say that conversation went nowhere. Later that morning, around 10am I went down to talk to the manager "Maria". They left no communication from the previous shift. After explaining the situation to her, I felt like she was insinuating that we had something to do with the water issue coming from the ceiling. She lied to me about this issue happening before and said she has been working there for 7 years and has never heard of that happening contrary to the 3 different engineers in total that came to our room stating it happens all the time. I let her know how j felt about the whole situation and her lack of compassion to our inconvenience so she offered me a $50 food and beverage credit slap in the face. Knowing about hospitality and taking care of guests, I was shocked at her smerky responses to my concerns. She offered a resort fee credit instead of the $50 food credit which was the same amount and that's when I decided to let people know how terrible the management of the beautiful establishment was. Needless to say that ruined our anniversary getaway and made all the other parts of the resort mediocre. The buffet was not anything to talk about, the "best tacos in Las Vegas" weren't all that, the TBone restaurant food was "ok" (staff there lived up to the high end atmosphere and prices) and the smoke in the hotel and casino was not as controlled as we are used to.  All in all, probably won't go there again.... Ever. Wouldn't send people there either.  Too many other options.
beautiful Casino, decent buffet, Restaurant Ok. Mamagement worse than  when the Mafia controlled Las Vegas.  Phony promotions Play the slot, and get free gifts.  A lie from the  casino, A gift is not a few free entries where thre a millions.  False Advertising.  It is sad that management has to hceat people.  It is bad enough , thast the slots are not very loose in my opinion.   And when one swipes their card, the higher gamblers get a better shake. It certainlyis not random.   I should thiink that this is illegal, and should be investigaterd by higher aurthorites. Probably will not haappen, and Station Casinos will continue to rip off players.   A sad state  afairs..
I decided to check out this Casino with the family which includes 2 little ones under two. I read about the kid friendly location and even though there are activities for kids I wouldn't use the word FRIENDLY. Rude is how I would put it. I was walking with my stroller to Rubios,  which is in the casino. I was near the entrance and received a phone call. I stopped walking not on the carpet not near a slot not near anything but the door and was approached by a security guard asking me to leave the casino as he pointed towards the door.  I asked where he wanted me to go, being confused that i was being asked to leave and he said I'm not allowed with kids.  I was by the door. Nowhere near a slot on my phone as the kids slept. Then i told him can't i go to Rubios and he said ok. Then proceeded to follow me there like a criminal. . . The experience with kids quest was as bad. I wanted to drop off my kids for an hour but i didn't know that you needed a reservation for a baby. No problem.  Decided the next day to just bring my older son who is 22 months.  Went in and was greeted seriously greeted didnt get kn a word before the lady said rudely Lke I told you yesterday.. you need a reservation. I did not know that my almost 2 year old was also considered a baby as well. Maybe using a polite tone would have been helpful. I wasn't rude to her or mad about it. It was just a misunderstanding. As i left i was surprised that these bitter people work with kids. . . Overall there are quite a few families here. But as for us... being watched and judged by a casino even though we came to celebrate my birthday weekend with family.  Bummer.... at least the buffet was good.
Hard to believe you can call it a resort. . No poolside dining? . No ability to order room service from the pool? . . Not like any other "resort" I've ever been to. . . I understand the concept of off season service, but most other hotel resorts make accommodations for their guests. . I guess I have to go wander the casino in my swimsuit if I want to eat....Ewww.
It's nice, but the pool closes at 6. Really?  The spa closes at 7. The rooms are nice, but I wouldn't come back.
Wed. October 22, All the rooms are sold out..  I'm in room no. 9-150. If you love to exercise this room is for you. Be prepared to walk awhile to the end of the building to get there. Nice view of the pool, sunset, big bathtub, bloody snot on the wall I clean off. Neighbors' door very loud when it closes, it shakes the whole room.. Always too smokey for me in the casino area. One day it will be prohibited.. I redeemed 150K Myvegas LPs. Comp resort fee. Thank you.. Cash is not accepted for deposit, only credit card.. Aria is better. Waaah, not available for 99K anymore.
My fiancee and I stayed at the Red Rock Casino Resort for the long weekend. Overall we enjoyed our stay. There are many things we loved about the resort and few that could improve but not terrible. . We loved: the pool area ! It was awesome. There are Many different pools available, where if you don't like crowds, you can enjoy other less crowded pools. Another thing we loved is the spa and gym area since we like to work out. The rooms were very nice and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. . One thing that needed improvement was a buffet. It was just OK and decent. Not the best we had. . The only thing we didn't like is that shuttles to the Strip were not available often. Because the resort was little too far from the Strip, it would be nice if they had fewer more shuttles. . But overall we enjoyed our stay and would return again.
if you log on to stations .com you see my face when you log in to your account, many people have asked in the past , have I ever gotten payed , The awnser is know , know A big fat Goose egg...lots of people approach me and say I know you, well, I'm tired of it and I wish they would take it down......Anyhow, the machines are kind it's just luck, they started serving bottled water not spring anymore , it's drinking water, terrible, they are getting cheaper by the minute....they need a better cleaning crew picking all the trash and ciggerette buts from the dirty ash trays left everywhere, I think the Red rock needs a Overhaul....my casino host Todd is the best ! I need to clone him, other that not to much personality or humor in this place, it's kinda boring needs some serious excitment
Definitely one of, if not the best stations casinos. A far drive for me but being right off of the 215 it wasn't that bad of a drive. Plenty of parking on all sides of the casino depending on what you looking to do. The slot area is very clean and there is not an overwhelming smoke clouds as some casinos suffer from. The Dodd court has decent options and there are plenty of dining options around the casino. I definitely wish it was a closer drive.
