So I have to admit that lately Guy Fieri has been letting me down with some of his recommendations, and particularly his Vegas restaurant at The Quad. However, this was my second visit to Bachi Burger, and this place still rocks. We were three ravenous hikers fresh off a three hour drive back from Zion, still coming down from the adrenaline high of hiking Angel's Landing. So naturally we stuffed our faces with the truffle fries (fantastic), kiki burger (amazing), spicy miso burger (good), peking duck steamed buns (good but covered in cilantro which I HATE), and I topped all that off with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake (good... but definitely overkill at that point). The Asian fusion is right on point, and the burgers are clearly made with high quality ingredients with a lot of thought going into the various flavor combinations.. . My only complaint is that the bathrooms were not very clean and they made us wait for a table at 3 PM on a Sunday, even though the restaurant seemed pretty empty. Also the parking lot (where you have to wait for your table) smells horrendous because there is a dumpster full of rotting fish from the sushi restaurant next door.
Bachi Burger is a great place for a gourmet meal at an extremely reasonable price. . . Their oxtail chili cheese fries are out of this world. Also ordered the only kind of poultry burger on the menu which is a chicken/turkey mix and so delicious. Don't forget to. Order one of their amazing fries that comes with a palette explosion dipping sauce. . . I went for my birthday dinner and having a large group of 10 people they told us we can only have 3 separate checks with a max. Of 3 payments per check............ To break. It down if there is a group of 4 and each of which would like to use a debit card to pay ....... All hell breaks loose and staff gets very defensive. . . Great food great atmosphere, staff is a little arrogant but I can put up with bitchy girls all day for this food.
Shogun burger was DELICIOUS. The seared foie was so buttery and went so well with the poached Asian pear. I asked to have my burger cooked mid-rare and it was perfectly cooked. . Kiki burger and Mr. Ho's burger were also very good. . . Also got the oxtail chili fries. Personally, I thought the beans in the chili were just barely undercooked but it was awesome besides that and three of us killed the plate.  . . Service was great. Even though the place was packed, someone was always making sure our water was filled and we had everything we needed.
A Japanese influenced burger joint? Great freaking idea and it really works! All the burger combos on the menu sounded great and we ended up ordering the veggie and Kiki's burger to spit and try something new. The veggie burger was really yummy but super crumbly and coulda used more sauce as the patty was a bit dry. Kiki's burger was excellent and it arrived and pre-smoosh was about 8 inches tall. With a side of the garlic fries, it was heaven. With a beer and garlic fries, it was nirvana. The service was also excellent and everyone was insanely nice. Highly recommend!
They do take their sweet ass time making these burgers.  I would at least block out an hour if your going here even for a party of three.  Yes...they are friendly.  . . The menu is creative but when it gets busy....it gets real busy and their service level goes out the window.  Look forward to checking out their other location next time.
Awesome !  Awesome ! Awesome!. Food , service and atmosphere.
If you love burgers and you love Asian cuisine, you'll love this place. And I bet you won't find a better burger anywhere this far off the strip. Get the Ronin for your first burger, and the oxtail chili fries, and thank me later. . . It gets pretty busy on weekends, which is expected for high-rated dining, however it seems they're slightly understaffed at times - the only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5.
I wasn't sure I would like this place but I LOVED it.  The Parmesan truffle fries were amazing. The plan was to order two burgers and share but neither of us wanted to give up more than a bite of our burger.  The staff was very helpful with our order and kept our drinks full and our bellies fuller.  We ordered the Kiki burger and the Miagi-sun. AMAZING.  So worth the drive off the strip.
My boyfriend and I entered bachi burger with the thought of exotic flavors and delicious high-quality beef. Though the beef may have been exceptional, we both were disappointed with how overpowering the flavors were of everything else other than the beef. Cooked perfectly at medium, we would have liked the burger to not be completely overshadowed by what was an addition to it. . . He got the Miyagi-San burger which tasted more like sushi than it did hamburger (and I took a bite of it!) I got the Ronin burger where I thought the Katsu BBQ sauce was way too sweet and made it hard to keep eating.. . Call me "old-fashioned" or "all-American" but I'll take a Great Burger where I taste the beef before these two options any day, . . For $40 + dollars, we had two burgers, two sides of fries, a beer and a green tea. I hoped to actually enjoy my meal rather than us question to one another whether the burgers were worth even worth eating. . . We found more enjoyment giggling over the green sunglasses with no lenses, neon orange shirt wearing hipster next to us than our food. I was so excited about this place. But it just wasn't good, in our opinion.. . Wait... the fries were good! Two stars.
My 500th review.... WOW. FIVE HUNNIDD. 5 hundred ones.. . On my 2nd trip back to Vegas in as many weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they justopened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the entire restaurant. . . Waited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.. . For my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there. . . My friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.. . Service was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say. Thank you Bachi Burger but I think I like the Summerlin location better. You know what they say about first loves... They  never die. And Summerlin won me over at first bite.
Thank god this place is opening a location off Sawtelle in Los Angeles because they've got juicy delicious burgers here.. . Shogun Burger:. The burger I must say is super over priced. $26 bucks! Apparently if you order a Wagyu Burger Meat (Their specialty meat) its $16 alone + whatever it is you are ordering. But the meat itself was cooked in a way where it was really juicy but also made me think of a house bbq with good company except the meat is much more marinated in its own type of flavor. Not overly juicy but not super dry. The perfect burger as I would describe it. It came with a small puree peach just to clean your pallet before taking an enormous bite into that burger.. . Pork Belly Buns:. If you love pork.. You are definitely going to love this bun. This chunk of pork belly in a bun bao is juicy. Soft. Delicious. You cannot go wrong with this appetizer. Yum!. . . Mushroom Truffle Fries:. The sauce was delicious. Dont be on a diet trying this place out because youre totally going to regret it lol
Best burger I've EVER had!!! And I know what I'm talking about, I've had a lot of burgers!! Everyplace I've ever been to, I've always searched for the perfect burger. Well, I finally found it at this quaint las Vegas establishment!!!
I hate to write this review b/c I really wanted to LOVE this place.  My friend recommended that I visit this place while visiting Vegas...so I went out of my way, ventured off the strip, and had the Miyagi'san.  It was just ok.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  But I've had better burgers...and I have paid less.  However, I understand that it was grass-fed beef and all, and that is why I had to pay so much for just one burger and an order of fries...but I've experienced better.  That is all.
Joel wanted a burger for lunch and I just wanted lunch. We finally agreed on Bachi Burger.. Since it was lunch time it was pretty packed. We only waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. This was our first time here and I noticed they merged with the ramen restaurant next door. Very cool! We looked over the menu and I immediately saw they offered bao sandwiches!! They offered my favorite kind too! The peaking duck bao. Joel ordered Kiki's burger and we shared the truffle parmesan fries. . . The fries came out first! They were thin cut, crispy and came drizzled with truffle sauce  over them. I also ordered a side of garlic chili sauce to dip them in. Yum! Next came Joel's burger and my duck bao. Joel's burger was messy!!! It had lots of shiitake mushrooms, a slice of gruyere cheese and a thick juice burger patty. By the time he finished I felt like I needed to hose him down he was so covered in burger and sauce. My bao was tender and the meat was flavorful. It also had a thin slice of egg and radish and came with a side of hoisn sauce. That complimented the bao nicely. . . The service was prompt and friendly. I always love when places pay attention and refill my water glass when empty. The Bachi Burger staff fit the bill. The waiter even quicklybrought napkins when Joel was messy. . . The decor is basic. The wooden benches and chairs are not comfy. They also have a bar you can sit at, but those high chairs didn't look any more comfy. . . I think it's great the Bachi has merged with the next door ramen spot. It lets them offer more options and a larger dining place. On the price it is a little expensive. ($3 for a soda. I'll stick with water.) . . Bachi Burger was tasty, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back anytime soon.
So good, i could die, It's a gourmet burger and you really get what you pay for. It's a great vibe, super nice decor, asian fusion style bugers. I come here everytime because all burgers on the strip disappoint. Ronin burger is a great great burger to start off with, come back and try everything. There is boba so that is a huge plus if you are having that asian craving inside you, I know everyone has it. Service is great and I always leave happy and full. My tongue and heart sing in harmony as a take every bite, and the heavens ring as the joy of my stomach reaches fullness and its enlightenment.
After reading the reviews, what would stop you from heading down to bachi burger and seeing what all the hype is about?. . But no no it's no hype. The food is actually, in my opinion delicious!. We started with the oxtail fries, because after so many reviews about it and on top of that who doesn't love oxtail! Seeing the pictures made me want to dive in. Of course I took a picture myself. It was a perfect balance of crunchy from the fries and softness of the oxtail meet that was laid ontop and the egg is perfect to balance out all the flavors. I'm not much of a heat fan so I just dismissed the jalapenos. Btw, this order is pretty big. It was perfect for my friend and I and then some but it was just the two of us so the more the merrier.. . Then we ordered the Kiki burger, medium. It was nice and warm when it came out and we took our pictures for Instagram of course. Then we both dove in. The bun was nice and soft and it was toasted on the inside. Veggies looked like a spring mix and that sauce on the side had hints of citrus and sweetness that made the burger even more delicious. . . Reason for the 4 stars being that the service was not great. I felt like we were being rushed and it took forever to get a refill on our water, I guess it was because it was getting a little busy but that doesn't mean that you start being rude to your customers, even if the food is great. You'll eventually lose people that way or we'll end up going to another location. But the food is the real star of the show. I wouldn't go to this location again, I'd rather go to the other location even if it's further.
Seriously the best Burger and fries I've ever had the pleasure to try.  I ordered the Banh Mi Burger and couldn't even think of one bad thing to say.  The burger was perfectly cooked and super juicy. The herbs and daikon were very fresh and provided a nice crunch. To go with it I ordered the truffle fries, haven't had truffle fries before so I can't really give a good comparison, but these were delicious. . The Vietnamese Coffee I ordered was a bit light. Too much milk, and they didn't use the normal condensed milk. That's really the only bad thing I could think of with this meal. . . The service was great, it was nice to see that the manager actually rolled up his sleeves and was helping out taking the trash out and wiping tables when it started getting busy. Usually never see that. . . The interior was nice, very clean.  Only thing I could have dealt without was the music, it was very loud for time of day I was there.. Oh yeah, and the hipsters... I could deal without them too but it didn't distract from the amazing meal.
Crazy good food and quite reasonable pricing!. . I had the shogun burger with the foie gras waygu and unagi. Awesome.. Wife had the Mr Ho's...also very tasty.. And the Ox tail fries...to die for.. . My only negatives. The hostess didn't seem like she wanted to be there, and we suspect they gave our order of fries to the fresh ups that just sat down at the bar next to us, even though we waited longer. . . Other than that, it seemed the manager on the floor was on his game, rectified the situation, and was genuinely happy to have us there as guests.
After seeing this place featured in Food Network's Triple D, it's been something I've always wanted to try in Vegas. There's never enough time when visiting Sin City but we made sure this time Bachi Burger was on our itinerary. Hopping on over here after a show off the strip, their closing time at 1am was perfectly convenient. . . OXTAIL CHILI FRIES ($11.50) is a must-order. Most poutine fries I've had other than in Montreal tend to get soggy from all the gravy, but not here. I also love that it's not thick-cut resulting to a most-welcomed crunch on each bite. With beans and shreds of oxtail meat in the chili sauce, topped with garlic aioli, plus cheese and jalapenos, each component delivered its purpose. Let's not forget the cilantro which is my favorite part as it added a clean and distinct finish to the flavor profile. This was the bomb.com!  . . RONIN WAGYU BURGER ($16) normally comes with Angus beef patty but you can request for Wagyu meat for extra $$. I suggest you go this route because I tell you, it makes a huuuuuge difference. One bite and the unmistakable taste I got instantly was from the high grade beef. It had a nice smoky char-grilled flavor that was oozing with all its juicy splendor! WOW! The caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, and katsu bbq all fused well together into this phenomenal finished product. I really love everything about this burger including the bun! Not sure if you need the yuzu citrus aioli on the side because it's already flavorful as it is. . . KIKIS BURGER ($12) is Angus beef patty with sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. After having the wagyu beef patty with my Ronin burger, it was hard not to spot the difference between the two. The former was definitely more delicious however, let's not forget this burger had bacon and everyone knows anything with bacon is good. When in doubt, stick with the Ronin. . . CHILI FRIED CHICKEN ($7) was good but just not the flavor I was looking for. I was hoping it was more like a Korean chili chicken with a sweet glaze, instead, this was more tangy and on the citrusy side. Packed most of it home and ate it the next day. Surprisingly, it tasted better.. . Our server was on top of things and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I mean who doesn't like talking to people who knows what they're talking about? The rest of the staff was friendly and in a genuine way. Can't complain! . . So happy Bachi Burger has now opened its doors in LA. Soon OC, I hope!
Wish I could review the food but can't.... Was seated with a friend at 9pm tonight, hostess was very friendly. Unfortunately after 15 mins no one even acknowledged us at the table. We left. :(
I stumbled into this place after first moving here, and will continue to bring my family every time they come into town. . . These Burgers are so juicy and the flavors are all so different and well put together. If you want a unique experience of Asian-fusion burgers this is the place to go! My favorites are the black and green burger and the one with curry (I don't remember the name). . Will definitely be coming back!
Omg is amazing. The wait is well worth it. The oxtail fries so delicious. The burgers are big and greasy. This is a place to take your friends and enjoy a great meal.
The oxtail chili cheese fries is a must!!! LOVE! I came here late in the evening during the week so seating did not take long at all. I do remember coming to this place around lunch time a year ago and the wait is pretty long. Not sure if this has changed. Also ordered the spicy miso burger. Yum!
ahmazinggggg gourmet burgers, wow! You can smell the deliciousness even when you drive by! So many unique burger choices, or the option to create your own! Edemame- wonderful. Little sausages- delicious! Maui onion fries- out of this world. Service was awesome, as everyone was friendly and smiling. I can tell this will be a favorite of ours!
I really do enjoy BachI Burger. I have been here about four times now, and they do not disappoint. Now that they have combined with Shoku Ramen, I enjoy it even more. . . One of my favorites is the spicy miso ramen.  It's done extremely well, but it's not all that spicy, so if you are looking for something extremely spicy, this is not going to satisfy that craving. However, I do have a very high tolerance for spicy food, so it's worth noting that I might not think it's spicy, but it might be spicy for others. The serving size is on par with most other ramen joints.. . As for burgers, my favorite is the Kiki Burger. It is filled with hearty mushrooms and the flavor combination is amazing. No complaints here. The burger is huge and done right. . . The truffle garlic fries are also one of my favorites. It's a wonderful combination and I have to get it every single time...even if it's with my ramen. . . The service is good here and it has a hipster vibe...I'll leave value judgements about the atmosphere up to the individual, but it's a fun vibe. Overall, always extremely impressed and enjoy them very much. . . The only caveat to all of this is how busy they can get, and deservingly so.  The wait has stopped me from eating here a few times, but if you try to get here during down times it's not too bad. If it's a rush hour though, be prepared to wait. My latest time eating here was this past Thursday night around 6:00 pm and there was no wait at all.
What do I do when I first land in Vegas? I start looking at my Yelp bookmarks!. . My cousin and I wanted to start things off with a great meal. To the days leading to our Vegas trip, he kept talking about Bachi Burger until my ears had a constant ringing! I finally gave into his pleas and agreed to go. After picking up our rental car we headed to Bachi Burger.. . When we arrived, around lunch time, it was semi-busy. The hostess quoted us a seating time of ten minutes. It seemed the wait was shorter than that. We ended up getting a table within five minutes. Once we were seat, our menus were handed to us and was told our server will be right with us. Our waitress came to us within a couple minutes and took our drink orders. After being dry from the airport, I decided to get an alcoholic beverage. I went for the Sake Sanga-Ria.. . The Sake Sanga-Ria was a light and refreshing drink. The combination of sake and sangria had an inviting taste, but then knocks you with a light buzz. Who am I to complain about that! The bits of apple in the drink were also laced with the concoction of alcoholic goodness.. . For our appetizers we ordered the following, which include these ingredients:.   . - Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black, Vinaigrette,  Hoisin, BBQ Sauce. . - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries With Garlic Aioli and Fried Egg. . The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. The steamed bun was soft to bite. The veggies, boiled egg, and sauces made the steamed bun very enjoyable. Next, the oxtail chili cheese fries. I have never tasted anything like this! I'm only fond of the chili and cheese on fries, but the oxtail takes this appetizer to another level! The oxtail was tender, fries crispy, and the chili thick. Adding the fried egg on top of this dish my sound weird, but it just made it much better.. . For my main course, I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger. This burger was composed of chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. When I received my burger, it was piled high with the listed ingredients. I had to split the burger in two to handle this burger. Biting into the burger brought memories of another favorite burger spot of mine in San Jose, CA. Konjoe Burger. The summation of this burger was juicy, tender, and crispy.. . . The nagging of my cousin about this place was well worth it! This was just our first stop, but I felt like we overdid ourselves. Oh boy!
Overrated and overpriced. The utensils were dirty, the glass smelled, the ox fries were tasteless. Waiting to be seated for 15 minutes with several empty tables available.
I came with friends 3 times before we were able to get in without waiting an hour. The line is out the door and taxis are shuttling tourists from the strip non-stop.. . Food was good, don't get me wrong. But waiting an hour for a burger? The food wasn't anything that blew my mind, but it was good. French fries were very good, I enjoyed them more than my burger.
so sad... oxtail fries.. was just like reg chili cheese fries.. oxtail where? had to try the foei gras even though i was really feeling the spicy miso burger.. 26$! for the showgun or shot gun burger whatever! it was a long wait and i was hungry and dissapointed .. walked out of there with the same facial expression as this other group now we know why they were not smiling
Best Burger in town hands down. Can never get enough of this place. I take everyone who comes in from out of town. Go hungry and get some of the apps as well.
I was so excited to finally try this place because I've heard so much about it from other food fanatics. I love me a good burger! I do give them an A for creativity, but that's really it. I WAS warned that this place is overhyped, and I'm sad to report that indeed, this place is overhyped. However, that is not to say don't come here at all. If you've never visited, give them a try! They have really fun burgers that deliver in taste. It just didn't satisfy my craving for a burger though.. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: The portion received could easily feed 4 people who are also ordering a burger. I felt like my beau and I barely put a dent in it! They really skimped on the oxtail and chili cheese though. Taste wise, it's good, but nothing amazing or memorable. I was pretty disappointed that it just tasted standard and you were lucky if you caught a small string of oxtail with your fork as you dug into the fries!. . Banh Mi Burger: We just had to try this one. It does remind you of a banh mi! Great flavor, but it still left me wanting a burger. It just didn't do it for me.. . Miyago Waygu Beef Burger: It had great flavor as well and perfectly prepared as requested, but it still didn't doit for me.. . Service: Though friendly, it was kind of lacking. They start slacking off once they put in your order and don't check on you after the fact.. . If you're looking for a fun and different take on burgers, please give this place a try. It'll be worthwhile because everything is prepared well. I also didn't really have a good first experience on account of the table sitting next to me, which is no fault of the establishment's whatsoever. They just made me feel so uncomfortable and I almost didn't eat my food because the older white lady was staring at me and commenting on how only skinny people could eat food like that, etc. Seriously? If I commented on your body type and looks loud enough for you to hear while staring at you as you're about to eat, I think you'd be equally uncomfortable. Thank God they left shortly after I bit into my burger. Rude.
Oxtail Chili cheese fries with garlic aioli, need I say more? This dish was featured on Guy Fieri's DDD, which is probably why it's always crowded. I usually like my burgers to be classic burgers....none of that fancy fusion stuff, but Bachi burgers have grown on me over time. I think my love for the oxtail fries has helped sway my opinion on fusion burgers. Ooh, the truffle garlic Parmesan fries are wonderful, too!
Great burger place off the strip. I got the Banh-mi burger and ox-tail chili cheese fries.. . Both were delicious and will definately make the trip out here again.  You must make the trip out here if you go to vegas.
I love the burgers here. I've always had top notch food here every time I visit. I wish it was a little cheaper and the wait was a little shorter. Besides that, the best of the best right here.
This place lived up to its reputation.  Busy atmosphere and unique food. Hands down the most unique burger I've ever eaten and ranks in the top 10 best burgers I've eaten.  Will be back for sure!
I'm usually weary when a friend suggests a fancy burger joint, especially since I derive most of my burger pleasure from the likes of a quick and affordable visit to In-N-Out. But, I like Bachi Burger for a couple of reasons: the location is off the Strip, making parking easy and the burgers are damn good and full of flavor. . . Bachi is one of the few fusion restaurants where the menu works on so many levels. Drink options include several Japanese import beers, boba milk teas, iced teas, and house sodas. I tried the cherry yuzu soda, which was quite refreshing. We started the meal with oxtail chili cheese fries. The portion was huge and meant to be shared. I loved the flavors of meat, cheese, garlic aioli, topped off with a perfectly runny fried egg. . . There were several options of specialty burgers to choose from. I went with the Ronin burger while my friend got the Kiki's burger. These burgers were all about flavor and texture. The angus beef was perfectly cooked, but everything worked so well together from the cole slaw to the miso goma dressing with the perfectly toasted buns. The yuzu citrus aioli was also a nice complement. Although I liked my burger better, the Kiki's burger is a great alternative, especially if you love mushrooms. Three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and a sweet onion marmalade takes this burger's flavor in a completely different direction. Bachi Burger is one of the few places in Vegas where I will endorse a $12-15 burger.
Bachi burger is a place I hit up when in Vegas, but I do like their other location much better than this location.  This one is much smaller.  I am not a red meat eater, so I opted for the 3 steamed pork belly bun.  I thought it was good, but living in the Bay Area, we have a food truck that serves the same thing.  I wish they served chicken or  turkey burger with any of substitute of the red meat burgers.  I never asked, but maybe they do..next time.  Always a fan here, just the other location.
Excellent burgers, liked the sweet potato fries; OK ramen.. . On a short visit to LV, my sister's family and I went for lunch on a Monday, about 1:30 there was a 15-minute wait. We had edamame, which was good but not everyone's going to like it; regular and sweet potato fries, the latter being noticeably better than the former but both were good; Miyagi burger is five-star; kimchee burger (forgot the menu name) is nearly as good, the plain burger (for the 4-yr old) was good too.  Nice selection of beer; the Rogue River Hazelnut Ale is very good.. . The next day, my sister and I went back for a ramen fix.  We split an order of the duck bao, I mustnot have had duck for a long time because I've probably tried it many years ago and vaguely remember not been impressed, and I wasn't here, either.  The rest of the bao was done just right, I'll try the pork belly bao next time for comparison.  We both had the tonkatsu ramen, she thought it was good.  I agree for the most part, but to me the broth was a bit on the sour side, and the pork belly didn't strike the right note for some reason.  The noodles and egg were OK.  I've had better ramen recently in NYC.. . I'll go back, the miyagi burger alone is worth the trip.
Amazingly on a Friday night, not much of a wait (no longer than 20 minutes) due to the Foodie Festival happening over at the Linq. Great to be off the strip. Eat like the locals do! I chose the Ronin burger, which was Angus beef, caramelized onions, coleslaw, Miso Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ Yuzu Citrus Aioli. She got the Kalbi burger and we shared an order of the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (garlic aioli and fried egg). Next time I will definitely try another burger or the duck buns. I actually finished the whole burger, it was so good. Such a treat.
I am always hesitant to drive somewhere to eat off of the beaten path when vacationing in Las Vegas because there are so many great places on the strip.  I was brought to Bachi Burger as a place we had to try, and the food did not disappoint.  . . My first impression was that of skepticism since it is in a strip mall with not too much else around.  The looks of the place are pretty underwhelming when leaving the glamour and all the lights to the dusty roads of the dessert, but the food was definitely worthy of the visit.  I ordered the Kalbi burger, with no mayo, and fries. The burger had an excellent flavor that was on the sweet side. It actually tasted like what I thought it would judging by the picture and the ingredients.  It definitely satisfied my burger craving.  The fries were regular, but they came with pineapple ketchup.  That also tasted like what I hoped for.  It had a mild pineapple flavor that was not too overpowering.  It was a very tasty meal overall.. . I am never too keen on leaving the strip when visiting Las Vegas, but Bachi Burger was worth the drive.  There are a couple of burger places in Vegas that I prefer, but they have unique burgers and ingredients here that make it worth a visit.
The 3 stars was for the food. Other than that service was rather aweful. We did not feel welcome at all! Server Nancy was a real defensive one too. She spoke too fast as if she was rushing us out and getting annoyed when we ask her questions. She had no sense of humor what so ever!  I will come back.... maybe.
I had the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger.  The , the decor is as expected modern, and the restaurant is clean.  The staff are helpful and very attentive.  The food has so many flavors, man it taste great.
