I recently stayed here for the first time and everything was fine.  It was not my first choice for a hotel and its definitely not the fanciest place on the Strip, but it had the best prices for our weekend, so, Tropicana it was!  We stayed in the Club Tower which was extra far from the entrance in  a standard room with two full/queen beds.  Everything about our room was upgraded and modern, but the tub seemed very worn and not white enough for me.  We had nice flat screen t.v and a wonderful view out of our window, which is always a good thing.  We didn't spend that much time in the hotel, but on Saturday night, we listened to the live band that played in the hotel lounge.  I love listening to live music, and this band played mostly old school R&B hits, so to me, it was great.  I'm not sure if Ill ever stay at the Tropicana again, but I did have a nice experience this time. Oh, and they also gave complimentary cookies!
Mixed feelings on this place. . . I came to Vegas this weekend for Frozen Fury. This was my first time staying at the Trop and my first Frozen Fury experience. . . Checking in: I arrived at about 3:30pm on Saturday and was three deep in the "normal people" check in line. Meaning I am not a. Hilton member and so forth. There were two people standing around behind the desk and one lady actually helping check in. Of course the "special" side was full of helpful employees. I think my frustrated face said it all, finally there was an employee who hopped onto the other computer to help reduce the growing line. When I was called to the counter the line had about seven groups behind me. Took just a few seconds to say go here, go there, enjoy your stay. . . The room: Eh. Nothing special. You can tell they updated SOME THINGS but still pretty outdated. Our air conditioner was set at 64 degrees and it was still so hot. The AC also made a trickling water sound. Luckily I didn't wet the bed. No fridge. Huh? We filled our sink with ice and that was not a big deal. Our view was a joke. We were overlooking the lovely airport, kinda, more like the broken down plane area. There were tiny bugs in the sheets but they weren't bed bugs (we checked Google). Our sheets had a nice big stain on them, luckily it was the top sheet so easily taken off. . . The casino: I kept thinking to myself that this is a junior casino compared to the other hotels. Small casino, smells like cigarettes mixed with cheap perfume, not busy, old people galore. I preferred other casinos. This is one of those casinos where you put a quarter in and walk away. No big winning here. At least for me. . . Trop plus is a joke. I still don't understand how it worked. They claim to pay for your first $200's that you gamble? Lose? As I said, confusing rules and not what it sounds like. . . Overall, I am happy I stayed at the Trop because it seemed to not be as busy as other hotels. I see why. Not the absolute worst. But not the Vegas experience I was looking for.  . Next time I'll pay the $50 extra bucks to get the VIP treatment at the MGM.
This hotel is a world away from a 4 star hotel.  The bathroom was filthy, full of other people's hair and who knows what else.  The front desk said that the room had been recently remodeled, however; the tile in the bathroom was cracked and full of mold, the toilet was chipped  and the plastic seat was very uncomfortable.  The complimentary shampoo etc was worse than a person would receive at a Motel 6 and the toilet paper was single ply, most rest areas on the highway have better..  The swimming pool was closed however; the hot tub was open which was also very dirty, full of leaves and cigarette butts.  Extremely disappointing.
Friendly employees.. Ok casino.. Slow internet, worse than dial-up, 1 mb/s (not a typo). . No buffet.. No food court.. No shuttles.. Dirty pool.. Bad plumbing, our shower ran yellow.... AC in rooms is weak.. Paid continental bfast, no better than basic.. Players card for casino is a waste of time.. Concierge is useless/incompetent.. Very limited show booking on site, and pay extra to print your tickets out.
I will always come here for my Vegas trips from now on. I got married here last Saturday (will review the wedding chapel separately, also an amazing job!) . . Check in was a breeze. I happen to be a Hilton honors member was it was needed since the lines weren't bad on a Friday afternoon. Renata checked us in and once she found out we were getting married their she upgraded us to a bigger room. She also surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Talk about exception service! . . I love that the Tropicana is towards the end of the strip (and let me disclose, my husband and I are in our twenties) and I loved the fact that it wasn't as crazy on the Tropicana end than towards the middle of the strip. If you want the crazy you can easily walk to other hotels but then come back to the Tropicana for a good night sleep.. Thecrowd here is a little older but all friendly. Their lounge is really nice, too.
NOT WORTH ANY MONEY!  We stayed there because our friends were staying there and we decide to go on short notice and thought it would be easier to stay in the same place. We usually stay at the Wynn but being that it was last min we couldn't ask out friends to drop so much money on the fly...so we booked the room and got the "Bungalow" by the pool.. The room was clean.. but it was very poorly remodeled...The photos online make it look different for what it really is in person... Here is the list... . . 1. Wall paper everywhere and uneven walls with the wall paper coming off the walls in the bathroom on the edge... not very good remodel job. 2. The bathroom in the photos on line for the "remodeled room" is nothing like what we got. the bathroom we got was smaller then my own extra bathroom at home that is for guests! . 3. beds are clean ill give them that... . 4. Bird crap on the edge of the baloney floor outside of our suite. And a piece of gum left from the previous guest on the floor by the base board.. gross!. 5. Elevators are disgusting! They do not clean the the floors, drops of dirt.. and I saw the cleaning guy with a mop he was coming out of the elevator and didnt even bother to clean it!. 6. Pool is boring and small... chairs are old and not kept well... and there "pool staff" doesnt even check to see if you want to order anything.... there too busy talking to there friends who are at the pool or each other.. the lifeguard yells at people to tell them there is 5 mins before they have to get out of the pool also.. . 7. The Beach Cafe is terrible! There are NATS` flying around at the bar not he straws.. and around the restaurant. The host sat us down and we did not get service for 15 ins so we left.. . 8. Carpets are old, stained and need to be changed completely threw the whole place... . To some it up.. this hotel should not be a 4 star hotel.. the front desk staff dont even bother to do there hair for work... lacking the presents of what a "resort staff" should look like.. I am not comparing this to the Wynn by any means.. because they are not anywhere close and you cannot.. but What I WILL say is that it is worth every dime to stay at places like the wynn and not save money to deal with places that call themselves a 4 star NEW HOTEL when the carpets are stained and the place smells like musc.. . If you doth care about luxury or if you have not stayed at a better place then Tropicanna, then sure you may like it.. but for me.. I will never be going back there..I prefer to be able to have room to put my stuff in the bathroom, clean floors and great venation for the extra price it cost.
If I could give this "resort" less than one star I would. It's worthy of zero stars!  This place was so bad I literally cried the first night! I definitely didnt expect it to be the COSMO but I at least expected it to be better than the stratosphere but it wasn't!. . 1.Dirty is an understatement. 2. The A.C didnt work the whole week I was there.. 3. I BEGGED to switch rooms and told they were booked.. 4.House cleaning threw away my drivers license because it was in a envelope and they thought it was trash. 5.pool was filth. 6. Front desk was very unhelpful and rude. 7. Maintenance was called to my room and did not fix the problem. 8. I could not walk on the carpet bare foot bc it turned my feet black. 9. Wi fi was a joke!!. . Ive seen Motel 6 that was decorated nicer, this place has nerve claiming to be 4 stars! The only positive thing I have to say is a dealer named john at the craps table was very friendly and helpful and remembered my name, he greeted me everytime he saw me, which made me feel good.
Honestly I am shocked at the reviews saying that the place was dirty. We stayed at the tropicana for the 2nd time earlier this month and we have always had a very good stay. The first stay we got a great deal on a 2 room suite and it was one of the nicest rooms that i had ever stayed in. This last time we had an even better experience. We were getting married (told the staff that) and booked a smaller two room suite than we had the first time. When we got there, not only were we able to check in early but we found out that they upgraded our room to the larger 2 room suite at no charge. On top of that, when we got into our room they had left chocolate strawberries for us and a bottle of champagne. I thought that was amazing since we weren't even getting married at their hotel. I also hadn't had any problems with rude staff either. I hope that people in the future have experiences that I have because I don't know if I would stay anywhere else in Las Vegas.
Since aging a few years and seeing some other spots in Vegas, its clear to me that Tropicana has to be dynamited immediately.  The gaming floor is small, outdated, and plain ugly. The low ceiling hallway towards the back to the bathroom is equally gross.   Trop has limited dining options, lousy pool, and a sportsbook that looks like LaGaurdia airport. I enjoyed my stay here as a Vegas rookie but spending time in other places over the years has shown me the light.  Tropicana is out forever.
Stayed here for 2 nights (Fri and Sat).  Booked the rooms through hotels.com and it came out to $300 for 2 nights.  We got the Club tower, which seems like quite a walk from reception to the room, but it really isn't bad.  Our room overlooked the wedding chapel/pool area.. . I wish they told us they were putting us in a handicapped room.  The toilet seat was raised and it was just weird.  I didn't wanna go back to the front desk to change rooms, so we dealt with it. The first day, housekeeping came by and I told her no need to clean the room since we barely used it and we did not have a 'do not disturb' sign in our room.  Well, we came back from the day's activities to find our room cleaned.  They threw out some stuff of mine that could have been trash, but was not.  UGH. Good thing they weren't things that were REALLY important.. . First time using the tub/shower (which was one for us), it wouldn't drain.  That was annoying.  Also, be sure to bring your own conditioner.  They give you 2 shampoos and 1 lotion, but no conditioner.  And one hand soap, which I guess you could use as a bath soap if you want.. . Since this is a Hilton/Doubletree hotel, they give you a voucher for a free cookie.  I always love staying at Doubletrees cos of this. They're delicious.. . Self parking area is small.
I've stayed at my fair share of both low end and high end hotels in Vegas. And Ive stayed at my fair share of high and low end hotels outside of Vegas.. . This is a 2, maybe 3 star hotel masquerading as a 4 star. And quite frankly, Im shocked they are able to maintain the ability to continue to callthemselves a Doubletree. I think if anyone from Hilton visited the property they would be embarassed. I know I would be.. . I admit, we didn't exactly book here by choice.  Our trip was incredibly last minute;  i was Pricelining hotels while boarding my airplane. We did the whole name your price thing,  honestly expecting the Westin to be our destination but Trop took the bite. . . Poorly and cheaply done renovations aside, lets get down to brass tax. When checking in we had a resort fee sprung on us -$40+ for two nights. $20+ a night gets you a small bottle of water and free wifi (1 gb only!). Then, our room which the front desk had stated to contain 2 queen beds were actually 2 double. We actually spent the first night sleeping in separate beds because it was difficult to get comfortable.  Not my idea of a Vegas vacation.. . The 8th floor of the Club tower has some sort of moldy issue happening. It smells musty and gross, and my allergies went absolutely crazy while in the room. . . I cant speak to the casino or the pool because we wanted no part of hanging out at this hotel and spent all of our awake time out at other casinos.. . Desk staff was rude and unhelpful. Literally any casino would be better to stay at; I almost booked at the 4 Queens for the same price and i honestly wish i had. The inconvenience of being on Fremont Street would have been negated by a better overall experience.. . I do not intend to return here. I spend 4 nights a week in hotels and would never have booked here had i known what it was like. As a flight crew member, my sympathies went out to the Virgin crew we passed in the lobby. If my company tried to put us in a place like this we'd complain until they moved us.
At the start of my stay I wanted to give the Trop a 2 star review due to rude Valet, long check in time with unoccupied staff at the bell desk and concierge chatting with coworkers instead of assisting the 1 person checking in a line of hotel guests. Then they gave me a cheaper room then I paid for and I had to request a new room, and the room cards didn't work on the doors very well. The bartender at the beach cafe acted like he wished my wife and I weren't bothering him with drink orders while he was chatting with coworkers. But, my new room was pretty OK, the main hall of table games weren't busy and had low table minimums. The Pai Gow table was so much fun, I had a blast with the other gamblers, and spent 3 hours winning some and losing some. Went to the Laugh Factory to see comedian Tom Wilson who killed although the host sucked but the opener was great. Check out was again awful. Couldn't check out from the room, the bell desk wasn't helpful and the valet was super rude again. All in all, I'd never stay here again but I'd be back to gamble and go to the laugh factory. Also I had drinks/appetizers at the restaurant Biscayne and it was pretty good. Overall I feel like it's a solid 3star.
