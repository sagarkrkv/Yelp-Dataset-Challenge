I can keep this short and simple: This is exactly like cheesecake factory (also owned by them). From the taste of food (which i like) to menu items to design to everything. Only difference is that they don't have a big selection of cheesecake. However it is really good, 24 hours (a plus), and less filled up. I can see myself coming here again.
Came in on a Sunday morning and only waited less than 10 min. The wait probably isn't as bad, because this cafe runs 24/7. We all ordered different things and they tasted delicious.. . Salmon & eggs: The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was very tender and didn't have an overwhelming taste of seafood. The eggs were also good (very fluffy).. Chicken & waffles: For me, the better half of the dish was the waffle. The chicken was very lean and seasoned well.. Corned beef & eggs: I have never seen corned beef prepared the way Grand Lux does it. Usually, the corned beef I order is a little mashed up and thin. Theirs is on the thicker side and in big chunks. I'm definitely not saying it's a bad thing, because their corned beef is at the top of my list. Not greasy either.. Red velvet pancakes: YUM. Just thinking about their red velvet pancakes makes me wanna go back. THE best red velvet pancakes you will ever find. Out of all the red velvet foods I've had, Grand Lux has convinced me that pancakes are the best way to have them. There's no way I'll ever be in Vegas without stopping by for their pancakes.. . Service was decent. The food came pretty fast, but our waitress had a very "fake" attitude. She said everything a little too perky and she talked to our entire table like we were kids. But whatever. She was the last thing on my mind. I was too distracted by the food haha.
Great food, nice atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Had the chicken Parmesan and shrimp scampi combo, it was really good. My husband had the BBQ burger and loved it the fries were amazing according to him.
Best described as "A High End Cheesecake Factory".  I heard that it is run by the same company that owns cheesecake factory so it makes sense.. . Stopped in here for Breakfast with some friends before G2E at the sands convention center.  It was packed but we only had a 10 minute wait.  The atmosphere is luxury meets comfort.  The breakfast menu has just about everything you could ask for, and I was in the mode for some french toast.  I Got the banana brioche french toast and my mind was blown.  Not only was practically just a loaf of bread cut in half and turned into french toast, but it was really freaking good.  I washed it down with a mimosa that was good, but I was hoping it would be a little more than 3 ounces since it was $7.
Have eaten here many times before usually for breakfast.  It's in the Palazzo Resort & Casino, one of my favorite Hotel Casino in LV.  The food is good, expect to pay a bit more if you order a la cart.  Better to go for the breakfast buffet.  The pastries are delicious and the breakfast meals are batches cooked therefore it's fresh when it's replenished. Always a good thing.  One less star for the service category.  It's a hot or miss from my experience but overall a great choice for breakfast and lunch.
I checked out the Grand Lux Cafe twice during my weeklong stay in LV. I went the first time because it was near my hotel and was relatively affordable. I went the second time because the first meal was that good.. . The GLC gives off the vibe of an upscale diner. It has a large and diverse menu, which covers all sorts of different options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's also open 24 hours. The price point is really reasonable for LV - anywhere from $10-$20 for the average meal. The server also told me that the pasta portions are gigantic, though I didn't have pasta when I was there.. . The first time I went to GLC was on a weeknight. It wasn't busy, and I got a table immediately. I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt with fries, which was quite delicious. The burger was cooked very well. The fries were a little soggy, but not too bad. The portion size was reasonable for the cost. They also give you bread as you're waiting for your meal, and the bread was freshly baked and warm, which I appreciated.. . The second time I went to the GLC was on a Friday for lunch. The place was packed with a line out of the restaurant. However, the line moved fairly quickly, and I got a table within ten minutes of getting in line.. . I ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me tell you, that was outstanding. Huge waffle. Really flavorful and moist chicken. The Pecan Honey-Butter Sauce was delicious, and the waffle itself was covered in pecans to add some texture that I enjoyed. It was also very reasonably priced for lunch fare.. . Why am I not giving this a five star rating?. . Simply, the wait time from the order to having the meal served was too long. On Tuesday, I waited at least 1/2 an hour to get the burger, and on Friday, it took even longer than that. If it's busy, I can understand that. The size of their menu, which is quite massive and diverse, certainly adds additional challenges. However, the place was dead on weeknight and I still waited too long. That knocks it down a bit.. . Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it.
This place is located in the Palazzo. I had breakfast here and ordered the egg white omelette with bacon, onion, and sausage. This was very fresh and savory. It wasn't oily like your typical restaurant or cafe you go to. The bacon, onion, and sausage was cooked and placed inside the egg white so it almost looked like a taco. This came with hash browns that was cooked perfectly, since it had the right amount of burning on the top.
Nice and beautiful cafe and bar.  Great ambiance friendly staff, great to get together for a beer or wine.  Variety of dishes and main courses in the cafe
Excellent and tasty food!! Located inside the casino... Wasnt expecting much. Pleasantly surprised!. . Ordered Trout and fettucini Alfredo!
Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and the noodles were fresh but the chicken was dry. Garlic Shrimp Noodles and Chicken and Waffles were better. Excellent service!
We were a little disappointed with this restaurant. My husband ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo. The noodles were very undercooked so he sent it back. They apologized and remade it right away, no problem. We thought problem was solved. We were wrong, they didn't cook them throughly again. I ordered the shrimp scampi...which was overlooked. I didn't bother to send my back. Not a great experience for our first meal in a Vegas.
Pretty disappointed. Came here with a friend and the fiance on my last trip to Vegas. We were tired of walking and wanted a bite to eat late at night. We saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. We ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. The food fell below my expectations. I thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. . . Food: . Chicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. . Ahi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish/sushi snob. . . Price: pretty expensive for the quality. Similar to the cheesecake factory price wise.. . Overall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. Some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late.
