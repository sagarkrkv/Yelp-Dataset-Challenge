During my 5-day stay at the Aria, it was only the time when I allowed myself to go all out and indulge in pastries and desserts twice a day, e-v-e-r-y-d-a-y. Located right next to the hotel elevators, I walked by it everyday and it's almost a crime not to indulge. Among the items tried: almond croissant, nutella brioche, sugar doughnut, vanille eclaire, macaron, crepe. There's a crepe stand on the side of the patisserie. The ready-packaged biscotti are also very good. My weight may have tipped the weighing scale over a little in the wrong direction, but it was worth it!
Jean Philippe is fairly tasty, but expensive. . . I stopped here for a cheese danish, which was pretty good. I also ordered one of their croissant sandwiches (turkey and cheese) and their famous opera cake - the turkey croissant was ok, but the opera cake was awesome. If you're a chocolate lover, I would give the opera cake a try. Service was good.
AHHHHHH this place is incredible!. . I did quite a bit of exploring during my time in Vegas, and I must say that Jean Philippe is one of the only places I would say is a must stop location in this city. It got to the point where I was considering skipping some really wonderful meals and just eating here instead. . . I'll keep it short and sweet. Every patisserie I tried was beautiful and delicious, wonderfully light and delicious, creamy and (in most cases) the perfect little crunch. This is the ONLY place you need to go to satisfy your sweet tooth.. . Ugh, I would do anything to be back at Jean Philippe right now. I'm done with this review.
Must try the macarons. Super cute store. They were getting set up for Halloween. And the lines moved pretty quickly. They were pretty busy at 7am already.
I would give it 5 stars except for the price..which really isn't a shocker since most establishments along the Strip are pretty pricey. Anyways, overall the dessert and crepe are sinfully decadent..The chocolate truffles are so good and the crepe that I got was pretty big. You can share one to lessen the guilt. The coffee was ok nothing to really rave about. I like to stop by once in awhile but because of the price I wouldn't go here on a regular basis.
The opera, creme bulee, coconut truffles, etc. are just a few of the items I splurged in purchasing because I won a gift certificate to this magical place. I am not a huge dessert person but I could buy just about anything from here and be very happy with my purchase.
It's in the strip and it's inside the aria so expect the price to be above modest. The desserts are visually pleasing. I had the Creme brulee and I wasn't really blown away. The cold cut roast beef sandwich was more of my liking. There are a lot of people so don't expect to find an empty table immediately.
This place was so delicious, I actually had double-breakfast. Come for the crepes, stay for the delectable sandwiches. I had the tandoori chicken panini and it was incredible.
Love this place!! Great place for a crepe, the desserts taste great and are amazing to look at as well.  I usually stay at the Aria and I eat here each day for something different whether its a snack, breakfast item, coffee, Gelato, or some candy.
Amazing desserts.. Service wasn't all that. The desserts are beautiful and tastes so good. The store is right in the casino.. We got a bit confused and thought it was in the shopping center next door. The selection was slim but we didn't get there till after 9pm. Totally worth the walk. Was looking forward to some French macaroon but they didn't have any.
Opens at 6am, great breakfast choices. I had a croissant that shattered as I ate it with little shards of buttery flakes - soooo good. They rival the ones at La Boulange. The cafe au lait was wonderful although the coffee could have been a bit stronger for me, but that's just me. My husband got the croque monsieur which wasn't the nicest I've seen but he enjoyed it. He had a bit of a time wrestling with the ham. He said he wouldn't order it again. Everything is pricey but like everyone says, it is Vegas...
Very cute place to go! I ordered a delicious sandwich that I wish I could remember the name of, but the alcohol made this difficult to do... Anyway, delicious! Great late night snack.
Gelato is heaven.  Every.single.time.  Cannot go to the Aria w/out stopping by here.  I love the seasonal items, too.  Chocolate pumpkin lollipops are a must for the babies.  4 Stars because they never seem to have enough people working there.  Worth the wait, tho.
