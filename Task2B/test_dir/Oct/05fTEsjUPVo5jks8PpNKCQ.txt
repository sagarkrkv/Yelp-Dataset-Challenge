Good brisket/pulled pork and the corn bread is insane. Also try the bacon potato salad.  RollingSmoke is tucked back behind the strip on a dark street and they close at 8pm Mon-thurs.  I will go back again, just gotta remember to tell them give me plastic wear... It's kinda hard to eat potato salad and Mac n cheese without them.
This place is AMAZING and you're definitely missing out if you don't stop by here. . . Went to Vegas for vacation and thanks to fellow Yelpers, we decided to go even though it was off the strip. They deliver to the Mirage but only for employees, not guests. If you take the taxi, make sure you have the taxi's company number or your hotel's front desk so they can call a taxi for you on the way back. Or you can try to walk to Trump hotel and get a taxi. . . It is a MUST you try their meatloaf and brisket. We eat a lot of BBQ joints and this place is hands down have the BEST brisket and cornbread. Trust me. . . The place is tiny, you order at the counter first then grab a seat. . . You'll know you're in good hands when you see a bunch of locals.
The food was good for the price. The Mac was good, but everything else was mediocre. The best burger in Las Vegas was good but it was meat loaf, not a burger and for that I am disappointed.
The ribs were burnt to a crisp and the brisket was so dry.  I can't believe this place has 4 1/2 stars. Wtf
Definitely the best barbeque I've had in Vegas. Don't waste your money at expensive restaurants on the Strip. The quality of the food is amazing at this place and the portion sizes are generous. Will definitely be coming back!
Great food, cheap for the size you get.. Make sure to come hungry or order one dish for two of you
Ok nothing but praise on this one. All staff were friendly and informative as this was our first trip. Then the food came, only planned on eating half and saving the rest for drunchies. That did not happen the food is great. Had the smoked links, pork and brisket. The corn nuggets are soo good. Check in on yelp and get a delicious dessert. A for sure return place.
Omg!! Thanks to my friend for recommending this place.... . Food is awesome...very delicious & tasty....prices as very good..you get a bang for your buck....they got a very good menu....it's hard to choose what you want cause everything on there is so tempting.... It's a place to come to if your in the mood of good bbq...
We got take out and the sauces are awesome!  We'll be back soon, the brisket is pretty freakin good!!. . Definitely recommend!!!!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I have not had anything at this place that I do not love!! I wish I could figure out how they make the Corn Nuggets. I would live off these things!!
Soooo good at a phenomenal price. I could happily just eat sides at this place they were all very tasty: okra, potato salad, bbq beans. The brisket was my favorite, but the chicken and ribs were also great. The pork had great smokey flavor but wasn't very moist. It was the lighter meat which always seems to be less juicy no matter where you go but with a little sauce it was fine. Staff was exceptionally friendly and the decor was cheesy but fun & endearing.
Last night on 10/9/14, I ate here and I cannot even give this restaurant one star but they make you pick a rating to post. We went there to eat for a club function. I don't know who picked it but this place is terrible. They serve you with plastic forks, knives and spoons that look like they've been rewashed. When I complained they brought out a new bag and when I took the spoon out of the new bag that I opened it had a dried worm on it. The food was greasy and my chicken was half raw..my friend's was cold. They use breed as filler for everything including massed potatoes.   The peach cobbler had two tiny slices of peaches and the rest was something I can't even describe. I will never ever go back there again and I would never ever recommend it to anybody.
Went here 2 weeks ago for dinner. I saw that this place got rave reviews on here and other sites and, honestly, I don't understand the hype. The location was a bit sketchy being literally under two freeway overpasses. I ordered brisket, chicken, with a side of mac & cheese and bread. The chicken and the mac & cheese were ok but the brisket was downright bland, even with a little bit of glaze on it. I'd be willing to give this place a second and possibly order different, but as far as first impressions go, I was not impressed.
Ok, so the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Like, knock you on your a** good. You will want to slip into a food coma afterwards. The location is sketchy. In a bad area of you ask me, but if you take a moment to pretend that you aren't surrounded by a buffet of strip clubs the food is honestly worth the risk of getting mugged. Seriously.
Have not been in the establishment, but they catered a BBQ for Pilot Air Fright. Great ribs, brisket, beans. Will have to go to the restaurant for s sit down dinner.
After hearing about Rollin Smoke from one of their employees, Dusty, that came into my shop to get a tire replaced, my wife and I decided to give it a try. Being someone who barbecues and smokes a great deal, I was a bit skeptical since other "bbq" joints we've tried just never measured up. I am happy to say this one did. We both had a three meat combo, with both of us having the pulled pork and brisket. My wife went with the spare ribs and I had the hot link for our third meat. We both found the brisket to be moist and tender with a great flavor and just the right amount of smoke. The pulled pork was moist and tender as well, though it could have used a bit more smoke and maybe some bite to it, more of a personal preference though. Fpr the sides my wife had the waffle fries which were good, but it's hard to screw up fires. I went with the bacon potato salad which was excellent, I also got an order of the corn nuggets which were nothing short of Oh my God good. Though it is a bit of a drive from where we live, we will be back.  To Dusty and the rest of the folks at Rollin Smoke, thanks for giving Vegas good bbq.
Awesomeness!!! They catered our work lunch and everything was excellent! When they ran out of food, the wait for them to bring more wasn't bad considering it was lunch time and they'd already fed 300+ of us. You could tell that Matt (one of the servers) felt genuinely bad that we were waiting but he kept a smile and sense of humor the whole time. Great food and customer service! Definitely will be having this again and again =)
I was craving barbecue while in Vegas and my good friend told me to come here. I ordered the Pit Special and got the brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and ribs with baked beans, mac and cheese, and fried onion strings as my sides. . . All we're delicious however I would probably get the hot links instead of the chicken next time. It satisfied my barbecue craving and the price was definitely reasonable. The staff was friendly as well and the wait wasn't too bad considering the line was out the door around 11am. . . I'll definitely be coming back!
I love this place!
All I can say is wow. This is the real deal BBQ. Ordered the rib sampler and brisket, greens, cornbread and Mac n cheese. Just look at the smoke ring on the brisket and the dark pink color of the ribs. You know they know what they're doing. I went to Pot Liquor at town square 4 weeks ago and it was during their soft opening so I didn't do a review. So far Rollin Smoke by far is much better.
Incredible pulled pork 1 block off the Vegas Strip. Bacon potato salad and jalapeno slaw.
We had a group and a back room was opened so we could all eat together in our own room!  The staff is really friendly and so helpful!  Love this place! Loved the burger! Can't wait to try more!!
We have eaten here several times.  I have noticed the quality of food dropping lower and lower with each visit.  I will not be returning.  I purchased 2 pounds of pulled pork.  I got 1.25 pounds of meat and the rest was fat. It was discussing and the staff could care less.
I have been here a few times. I have tried everything. Good food but not worth the hype. Great staff but the bbq is just ok. The banana pudding is great but the cobbler barely has any fruit in it. If you want some bbq a good place to go but not a place worth going out of your way for.
Best BBQ we have had on tour, and we had BBQ all over the country. Great experience and great service.
had really high expectation for this place , but unfurtunately it wasn't what i was looking for . too little flavor for my taste
Our neighbor recommended this place and it's definitely the best BBQ YET in Vegas!  . . The food is excellent and portion is great!  Wish they would open one up in Henderson!
by far the best bbq I've had in vegas but that's not saying much.  I tried the brisket (a little dry), pulled pork (a pleasant surprise), and spare ribs (very nice).  they were out of my favorite (hot links).  sides included beans (I asked for pinto but got baked.  they were ok), greens (nice heat but I like collards and mustard and I don't think they used either), mashed potatoes (very good), and mac & cheese (same as everywhere else). corn bread was good.  nice portion sizes.
Amazing food
The food steals the show in this restaurant.   Due to the popularity with the locals, the establishment is under strain to keep up.. . Food: 10/10 - This is where this establishment shines.  True barbeque.  The brisket and ribs have smoke rings in the meat and the building smells great when you walk in.   Great value!   You get a lot of food for not a lot of money.    Served on white bread just like BBQ should be!  . . Service: 7/10 - The kitchen really cares about what they are serving.  However the ordering process is under strain to keep up with the largely local patrons who visit.  The line frequently stretches out the door and with one person taking orders the wait can be longer than it takes to eat the food.    The person taking the  orders is friendly and trying hard to keep up but the management needs to improve the infrastructure.  The podium itself is very simplistic and the whole setup is not build to handle a crowd.. . Decor: 5/10 - They have a fish tank featured on the tv show "Tanked" but it is in sad shape.  The restaurant is worn out and a bit unorganized comprising of 3 disjointed eating areas.   The eating areas look like they were expanded to meet demand but in an adhoc manner.. . Cleanliness: 7/10 -  The area to get your sodas is sub par.  Poor lighting and hidden for first time visitors.   There were no major areas of uncleanliness but the restaurant was not beaming with cleanliness either.   Some improvement is needed.. . Parking: 6/10 - Parking can be tight.  Small shared lot.   Note: You are in strip club central in this area.. . Restrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.. . Overall: 9.5/10 - Don't bother with BBQ on the strip.  This is a local gem if you can go at off peak times or don't mind waiting for your food.  . . The food is what brings the locals here and for good reason.   The problems that this establishment faces are good problems to have.  Namely, they are growing fast and are in a phase where they should be planning their next phase of development.  They are in need of a re-haul on the building itself to bring the eating area into one cohesive place with a modern order taking setup.. . If they can overcome these obstacles there's no end in sight to the good things that lie ahead at Rollin' Smoke BBQ.
The food is good but needs more choices of bbq sauce. The one they have on the table is ok.  The brisket on the sandwich was chopped - would have been better if it was sliced.  The inside setup of the restaurant is a little bit awkward. The fountain drinks are in a closet. The person taking your order in behind a huge podium - you can barely see them.  The bathroom is well....... sad. The bathroom is nearly like a gas station's - useful but don't touch anything.  The paper towel dispenser fell off the wall, but nobody put a roll of towels on the counter so you can dry your hands off. They have rolls of towels on every table - just not in the bathroom.  Looks like the owner spent way more money on the mural in the 2nd dining area than in the rest of the place.
Absolutely delicious! Better than Phil's BBQ andmuch cheaper! If your craving comfort food like meat loaf, hush puppies, peach cobbler or banana cream pudding than this is the place to indulge!
Awesome. I came to LV from San Diego for fun and got hungry.. . I am spoiled because I life close to the world famous Phil's BBQ in San Diego. This place is heads up with them. This is the best compliment I can give to a BBQ place. . . We had the all you can eat, and everything was awesome, but the Beef Ribs have been world excellence!
I know I'm an outlier here but I think this place is 2.5 stars. I'm from the Sout and also lived in St. Louis and went with another die hard BBQer who grew up in fl and la. Everyone was very nice but was overwhelmed with the long lines for dinner and the food was just ok. Had baby back and regular ribs which were tough, brisket was dry, and Mac and cheese just ok. Maybe it was an off night but for vegas ellis island is still my go to place.
We picked this restaurant based on their rating. All these people were right! . . Walking in, it looks like a regular smokehouse but it is really bad a**. . . We got the baby back ribs and pulled pork sandwich. The hush puppies were the best we've ever had!
If you go, get the ribs!. The ribs are the best meat offered at RSBBQ.. The brisket was tender.  The chicken a little dry.  The on table BBQ sauce had a good flavor but was too watery and didn't stick well to the meat.. . Mac & Cheese, Okra were good side to accompany the rib.. Go for the ribs!
Read about this place while on the and and decided to come here straight from the airport. Was not disappointed at all. Ribs just fall off the bone,  the outlaw burger is huge!! It has brisket in the party. Prices are good.  We will be back!
Large menu, seems consistently busy and a BBQ buffet to purge on!. . We both ordered the all you can eat ($25 pp) which is good value! Round 1: ribs, 2 orders of hot links, pulled pork, 2 orders of brisket with the jalapeno cole slaw, kicken beans, mashed potato casserole and potato salad.. . REVIEW: meat was all tasty except for pulled pork was incredibly dry. Took a lot of extra bbq sauce to enjoy. The hot links are sure tasty with just the right amount of spice. We LOVED the kicken beans that were slightly sweet and savory -- Mmmm! The jalapeno cole slaw is unique and one to at least give a try. . . Round 2: chicken, 2 rib ends, ribs (again) and sides of fried okra, corn nuggets and onion straws. The chicken was juicy but came smothered in sauce which I don't care for. Rib ends were crunchy and had true smoke flavor. The corn nuggets are AMAZING with a sweet inside and perfectly crisp outside. The fries okra came with a side of sauce that complemented it well (sort of a Raising Cane's creamier sauce). The onion straws were average but tasted good.. . Luckily for them the 2nd round is smaller (less wastage). We left smelling like smoke and were super stuffed. We are not sure if we will give it another shot or not but we can say that we have been there.
Best BBQ in Las Vegas. Great mac and cheese. Each meat item is outstanding. Wasn't a fan of the Brat Dog thing, but otherwise, everything on the menu is mouthwatering.
First time and I fell in love with the place. The Outlaw burger is amazing. The pulled piggy sandwich was small but tasty. Will be back!
