From: ChefDan the FlavorKing. . As others have written, it kills me also to write this review. Two stars for the food.... . Atmosphere - four stars sitting near the big Buddha.. Service - four stars (possibly got lucky on the waiter). . ALL of the top items were sweet. Even the waiter admitted that was an issue. Squab with lettuce wraps, Spicy Tuna Tartare, Satay of Chilean Sea bass, Chinese five spice short ribs.... . . Us chefs know you can pander to a wider crowd by adding sugar and/or salt to your "sauce" and he did EXACTLY that and too much of it. Makes the sauces now "superficial" so to speak.. . SUMMARY - Frankly not much to say about it which is quite sad. We REALLY wanted it to work.
SKIP IT!. . Food was average at best, it's just another trendy restaurant that caters to people who want to be cool!. . I'll bet you don't find any locals in here, service is bad, food is bland, lukewarm, and wayyyyyyyy overpriced!!!. . SKIP IT!!!!!!!!
Sausage fried rice was recommended by our server, honestly sounded gross but it was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. So flavorful. Also had the filet pepper steak and it was excellent as well. Really enjoyable experience people watching but the highlight was the food. Wasn't expecting a lot, thought Tao was all hype but its worth the visit for the sausage friend rice alone.
I ordered the pork pot stickers, they were very good. Also ordered hot edamame which were decent. Sushi was very good but expected. I ordered the Jordan Cabernet which was $120, about twice what it retails. I then ordered one of the most expensive items on the menu which was stir fried lobster, super salty, a little weird, should have gotten the Miso Chilean Sea Bass. The highlight was the deep friend Bread Pudding, which was one of the best desserts I have ever ever eaten. The fortune cookie dessert was not very good, looked good though. I then got a Warre's 1985 port which was amazing. I would pass on this one, way better restaurants in Vegas.
Tao, Tao, Tao...smh...I really want to rave about you.  My yelpers warned me you wouldn't be worth the trip.  Ok, so I went in knowing that the food would be overpriced for Asian fare...so why was I so disappointed?  This is a very popular place and I wanted to try it...but I'm still trying to figure out why the place is so popular.  . . 1) I don't think I've ever been to a darker restaurant.  We broke out our cell phone flashlights to read the menu.. 2) The hostess wasn't very friendly and our waitress was just mediocre.. 3) I could get better Asian food at a nearby strip mall.. 4) The portions were ok.  . 5)  The pricing was just ridiculous!. . We were a party of 4 and we ordered the Orange Chicken, Scallops, Chilean Seabass, Coconut Shrimp, shared a Pad Thai, and Shrimp Fried Rice.  Total $236.  Smh.  Never again.  I should have listened when I was told not to go.  Oh well, it's Vegas, you gotta try everything once.  But just in case you'll listen...DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE.  I'd sooner drop $236 on the roulette table then go to this place again.. . Just in case you need a consolation prize...they stamp your hand for free cover for the Tao night club after you dine there.
Great atmosphere! My husband and I came here right after we landed in Vegas and arrived at our hotel (Venetian). Our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. The ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is upstairs which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). . . Our food was excellent. My husband got the coconut shrimp, I got Chilean sea bass and we shared shrimp fried rice they were all very good. But the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. We love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. We're considering going back for just sushi. It was so fresh and tasty. . . Lastly, if you eat at Tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! Overall great experience. Would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas.
Like this place. Went there last night for a Bday celebration. The waiter CJ was great.  It's always customer service that makes the dining experience even better
A must try. Jewel in the bunch of restaurants in between the Venetian / Plazzo. Tried Chilean Sea Bass, very very tasty. Tried lobster dumplings again very tasty and juicy. Dessert selection is very good. Cocktails are a bit expensive side as compare to wines but they are all worth a try.. . Must go!!
The decor was nice, service was good and the miso glazed Chilean sea bass is on the top 5 most delicious things I've ever eaten list! Next time I'm in Vegas I am definitely visiting Tao again!
