We loved it.... It's one of the best cirque solei... . There is no bad sit :)) very impressed
Me and my wife really enjoy cirque... this was a great show and in our mind is a close tie with "O" for best cirque style show in vegas! I can already tell we'll be seeing it again in the future!
I have not idea what the heck it was about, but whatever they were doing was pretty wonderful. I probably would not go again, because I didn't care for the music. The performers were amazing though.
Beautiful show.  Pretty expensive but very ambitious in its production.  Do yourself a favor and have a good friend who lives in Vegas buy the tickets for you.  We were so fortunate that our family friend bought these tickets for us because we ended up saving $300.00 for 6 people.  . A little tip...if you don't have friends in Vegas, it's ok to buy the cheap seats, because every seat is fantastic.  The performers are interactive with the audience and all in all, without giving too much away, you get a 360 degree view.. Be considerate, do come early enough to be seated before the show.  I noticed that just because you're in Vegas and people adapt this Vegas attitude of 'anything goes', it doesn't mean that it's ok to come to a show late, halfway, or lit.. Luckily, our section was fine but you can't help notice the other audience members who were unlucky enough to be seated next to those people.. Also, please stop taking flash photography, I'm sure you hate being blinded by a flash of light so be considerate of the performers.  . Good for all ages unless you have people in your party that are afraid of fire and birds.. Don't expect a storyline when watching this show, this is solid athleticism, acrobatics, dance, and strength.  . Good gift for people who never watched the show,my parents loved it.
BRAVO!  I was so impressed by this show. First of all when you walk into the Wynn you feel like a million bucks and this venue is no different.  The music, the lighting, the water, and the stunts were amazing!  I am definitely going back to Le Reve the next time I go to Vegas.  I like how the seating is round so practically every seat is a great seat.  If you sit too close in the "Splash Zone" you will get wet.
Sat/4 Oct saw the show with a coupla friends:. - With the local's discount it ended being total $123.75/tix with fees & taxes in the "Premium" section, which is the majority of the seating.  The base price (before taxes/fees) with the local's discount was $115.50/tix.. - We were in the theater at 6:10 pm, but there was no pre-show performers so nothing going on until 7 pm.  (Ka and Zumanity had pre-shows).. - Local's discount used to be $50/tix off, now it was only $31/tix off.. - Show itself was good, and my friends also enjoyed it.. - My personal preferences based on value (tix prices vs show quality): 1) Ka, 2) Mystere, 3) Nathan Burton's Comedy Magic (it was only about $16/tix), 4) Le Reve, 5) Zumanity, 6) Jubilee (I think tix were about $60/ea with the 50% local's discount).. - Eventually I'll see the other shows on my hit list: Absinthe, O, Cirque's Michael Jackson.
Such an amazing show! The further back you sit, the better as you can get a complete view of the room. If I would have known, I'd splurge and sit in VIP. Complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries? Yes please! . . I say a couple of rows in front of VIP and had an aisle seat (best seats according to the concierge selling the tickets. She was correct.) There are a lot of things going on all at once. . . Performers are being dropped from the ceilings, dancers are coming down from the stair case in the aisle and of course there are performers already in the water. . . This is a must see show if you're visiting Las Vegas. You receive a discount from the hotel of 15-20 if you're staying at the Wynn or Encore.
4 1/2 stars. This is rated one of the top Cirque Du Soleil themed shows in Las Vegas but compared to many others I've seen - I was pleased but not over the top thrilled. . . Don't get me wrong, I  enjoyed the music, theater stage and performance of all the actors, actresses  and acrobats but found the show to be short in duration compared to the other Cirque shows and comparable O show. I recall there actually was actually intermission halfway thru the entire show but this is no longer the case.. . Unique show entertainment and definitely worth seeing at least once.
The show may have been good. I do not know because they allow photography. If you look at some of the other reviews - they have attached pictures taken during the show. This lead to abuse. At one point there were six people in the rows in front of me holding up their cameras and taking pictures - plus one person using their I-Pad to film.. They allow pictures - people abuse the policy - and they do not have enough staff to enforce the policy. When I spoke to the head of the box office, I was told this policy was not liked by the working staff and that their marketing department started it years ago so they would get free advertisement on the internet. This show cost to much for this - go and see a different show that does not allow this.
It's a nice theatrical performance. however I went in there with high expectation after seeing the "O" since two are rated as smilar on Las Vegas' strip.. It was far from the "wow" for both me and my husband. Just ok, deffinitely felt like wot worse $350 for tickets we paid for 2 people.... On the plus side: theatrical effects, costumes, round stage that really gives you a good view nomatter where you ebd up sitting.. Down side: Not enough (at all!!!) arcobatic tricks that normally take your breath away in other cirque du soleil shows..There were so many things happening on the stage at once that it was hard to focus attention on one particular thing and admire performer's talent. . To conclude- if you are like us and prefer acrobatics rather than theatrics and debating between the "O" and "Le Reve", "O" is your answer.
