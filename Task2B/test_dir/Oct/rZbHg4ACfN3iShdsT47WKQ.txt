To be honest, I had never been to or even heard of Bobby Q's - and I have lived about 2 miles away for almost a year now. However, the boyfriend and his family are fans and we decided to go eat here this last weekend for the boyfriend's birthday. This night also happened to be the same night of the "Phoenix Hurricane" so we were happy to see the power was on, but boy were they busy!. . Something I have always found helpful: "Never eat at a restaurant that's not busy.". . We had to wait for almost an hour for a table for 6, but we knew that going in and just waited on the patio. I don't know if they are always that busy, but it seemed the waiting area could definitely have more chairs or space for that term of wait. And if the weather happens to not be so agreeable, like that night, they could use a bit more coverage so patrons aren't getting soaked. . . Anywho - onto the meat - literally. We were sat and started salivating over the menu - all sounded and looked good (I order via Yelp photos). We each ordered something different and there was a lot of sharing going on. One in our party was happy to hear they still offered the Crab Legs dinner, so take note if that's your fancy. We ordered the Rotisserie Chicken meal with (2) sides: mac and cheese and a loaded baked potato. Everything was delicious and satisfying and was plenty of food - I could have probably taken some home - and all for $13. In my opinion, this place has great prices. I expected, with the look and feel of this restaurant, to be a bit over-charged but I was pleasantly surprised. . . Boyfriend ordered the Brisket meal with (2) sides, and dang that meat was tasty! We loved how it came with sauce on it, unlike a lot of these places that are serving you sauceless, dry meat and you have to add it yourself. We also asked for extra and we loved how they brought us our own 'jugs' of regular and spicy (we used up all of the spicy) sauces for the table. . . I cannot remember our server's name, but she was awesome. The definition of what service should be in a busy, family style restaurant. We had a lot of requests for her and she was being asked for this and that left and right by almost every member of our table and she handled each one with patience and grace - I was impressed. And I am rarely impressed by servers lately. . . If it was pouring, and half of the city's power was out, and we had to wait on the patio for an hour for a table - I would still come here and eat again. I am actually looking forward to it. . . OMG those donutsssssssssssss. Make sure you get some. . . . That 'nightclub' they have though...
This place is soooo good. Brisket was fresh and tender .  I thought their prices were very fair. The appetizers are very good the Cole Slaw and macaroni and cheese was good. Service was great . I wasn't that  impressed with the doughnuts but it won't stop me from going back
Grate Food.
I've been here several times and I have never been disappointed. Brisket is delicious and perfectly tender. I've also had the pulled chicken and the catfish, both good. All the sides I've tried are tasty, the Mac and cheese is out of this world. They start with fresh cornbread that is also amazing. I grew up hating cornbread, but somehow decided to try it here, and now I'm hooked! The fresh mini donut things at the end of your meal are great too. It's great for lunch or dinner. I haven't been to their night club but I have eaten in the restaurant while the club was open. The club has a dress code which I did not meet, but I figured it didn't matter since I wanted eat. The bouncer gave me a funny look when I approached, obviously I can't wear jeans here! But then I explained that we just wanted to dine in the restaurant and he was more than happy to let us in. They also have a full bar, some good craft local beers on tap and decent cocktails. The atmosphere is really cool, inside and out in the outdoor seating area. You can't go wrong with this pace!
This place is a no brainer for BBQ!!! Food is always delicious and service is great . Every time I'm in town, I always make time for Bobby Q..
AMAZING!!!! The food is so good! It was freakin' delicious. We had the hog heaven with St. Louis, chicken, brisket, and baby back with three sides. OMG it was incredibly juicy and tender and tasty. They offered us different sauces. We went with the Carolina sauce. . . And the service was spot on. Everyone greeted us and was super friendly. These folks know "customer service". They made you feel like they're so happy you chose to come to their place.
Great service! Good cornbread, decent coleslaw but it ends there. Our waiter was awesome. He deserves 5 stars. Had a gift card to use & was craving ribs, ordered the big pig platter and the ribs were all that was edible to my liking. Obviously this place isn't hurting because it is packed!!! I will continue to go back to my usual bbq joints.
Happy hour 50% off and cold beer, near the hotel. The chicken wings and brisket rolls are excellent
Best BBQ food I've had in a long time. Jason, our server, was knowledgeable and very pleasant. Overall a great place for dinner.
This used to be a Bobby McGees, which the waitress will probably tell you its your first time there.  The BBQ is some of the best I have ever had in my entire life!  Little speedy, but  not unreasonable & well worth it, if you are taking someone out for a nice dinner, you will be sure to please!   . . They have outdoor and indoor seating, and a dance club setting.  It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern.   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.. . I highly recommend them!
If I want to have the same food with the same quality and ambiance in SF it would cost me 100+. The bill came as 40 something total! highly recommended!
On a visit to Arizona about a week ago I stopped by here for lunch before flying home. This is a nice barbecue restaurant that has an attractive interior along with a bar area. The hostess seated me and it took about 10 minutes before a waiter showed up. The restaurant was about 1/2 full and the waiter said he didn't see me seated. I ordered the smoasted chicken plate with beans, cole slaw and cornbread along with a salad. The salad arrived first and was good. What I didn't like was that the entree arrived just a few minutes later and I hadn't finished my salad and I am not a slow eater. I hurried to finish the salad because I didn't want to food to get cold. . . The chicken was average size and looked just like chicken that I cook on the grill. The cole slaw had pecans on it and was very good (4). I liked the beans too and graded them at a 3.5. The salad was good also and I gave it a 3. I liked the chicken but felt it only deserved a 3. Not bad but I have had many examples that were better. That's why my overall score for the meal is a 3.. . Perhaps my tardy waiter and the fact that the timing of the service was off were a fluke. I believe this is a good restaurant and probably is closer to a 3.5 or maybe even a 4. However that was my experience.
This was my first stop out of Mesa-Gateway airport.  Yelp! and TripAdvisor both had great things to say and I was hungry!  I had never been to the Phoenix area before, so I didn't know what to expect.  Let me tell you, as the good Reverend Hammer would put it, this place is "2 Legit 2 Quit.". . The food is phenomenal.  I've had Texas 'cue and this place easily stands up to it.  I don't say that lightly, as most BBQ is half assed.  Not here; everything is slow smoked for about a day and is tender as a young lover's dream.  The food is not shy on flavor, but they definitely let the meat speak for itself.  I had smoked prime rib, beef ribs, and baby back ribs.  Even the vegetables were delicious.. . Our waitress was Alexis; she was friendly, fun, and very helpful.  She was not shy about letting us know what she does and doesn't eat on the menu.  The best part is I totally believed her.  When she talked about the prime rib and the beef ribs, I could tell she really LOVED those items at Bobby Q.  She checked in with us at every pass.  Most times we were too busy stuffing our faces with the awesome food.  Alexis was damn genuine about making sure we had everything we needed.  The manager also came by and made sure everything was to our satisfaction; it was apparent that customer service is one of her top priorities.. . Rick G. hit the nail on the head -- the good people at Bobby Q really enjoy working there and make it a point to let you know that your business is appreciated.  It reminds me of the southern hospitality I experience when I'm in Texas.. . I'm back in San Francisco now, but have been thinking about Bobby Q's all day.  I can't wait to go back.
Don't go when it's busy on a Saturday early evening last Sat: 10-11, went there around 5:30 pm went straight to bar thinking we would be served faster than waiting in line for a table and we like to interact with the bartenders.  WRONG!!!! First off we sat down being the first couple, then another couple, then another couple and then a single person.  All of the other people were served and acknowledged before us!!!  We thought, are we invisible?  We had never been treated like this before!  Tony one of the bartenders NEVER made eye contact with either myself or my husband once!  They were smashed busy full service bar also going to the kitchen to get us cornbread.  But when you first sit at a bar you would think the bartenders know to look up occasionally and greet the customers with at least "We'll be right with you"  Tony looked pissed and unhappy the entire time we were there.  The food is fantastic, my husband and I shared the full slab of baby back ribs with two sides: mac n. cheese and coleslaw, excellent with the extra spicy, hot sauce on the side!  Nice hot doughnut holes delivered to us after we were done!  We have eaten here couple times before and got takeout a couple of times when we went camping.  Spoiled our Saturday date night for a couple of retirees.  Hope it wasn't because I was Asian female and he was grey haired older man, kept thinking it was because of my race but not sure, Tony greeted and went right up to take care of a Black couple that sat down next to us.  Who knows, very sad, bothers me until today.  Never treated like the invisible couple before at a bar!
Took previous reviews and had the Brisket sandwich... Very good! Beans- loved them!! Corn bread yummy as well. Alicia our server was so sweet, friendly and accommodating! Definite place to visit again
I'm not generally a brisket fan, but I always go with the server recommendation. So glad I did!
Free sides of corn bread and donuts for desserts? Sure! The food was very tasty and price is pretty average for a bbq joint. My baby back ribs were delicious, but they are too fall off the bone if you get my point. I prefer ribs that still cling to the bone, but can be pulled off easily as well. To each their own. The sauces were amazing and the portions are ridiculously huge. Sharing is recommended if you don't want to take home leftovers.
I literally left Bobby Q's last night thinking, I need to bring anyone and everyone I know from out of town here when they visit us.  Here's why:. . Almost immediately after seating us at the booth at the bar (the wait was 50 minutes for a table vs immediate for the bar), the waitress showed up to greet us and get our drinks, and soon after brought us their oh-so-delicious cornbread.  We were set on the Whole Hog Heaven, which was a choice of 4 meats and 3 sides, but seeing that it was only me and my boyfriend. our waitress (I feel terrible for not remembering her name) suggested the Sunday special called the Family Platter which was for $33, you get a little less meat than the Whole Hog, 4 pre-chosen meats: chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs, and 2 sides.. . Less than 10 minutes after placing our order, our food was here with an extra helping of spicy BBQ sauce.  It was marvelous.  The mac and cheese was the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac and cheese my 10 year old self could ever ask for.  The shoestring fries were miserably thin, but I'm just biased being a fan of steak fries.  The brisket simply melts in your mouth.  The pulled pork does too, but only as much as pulled pork can.  The chicken was a lot better than I expected and I hate ordering BBQ chicken.  Oh but those ribs, the meat just fell right off the bone.  We were starving walking in, but stuffed after polishing off everything but the ribs.  My boyfriend, who had every intention of eating all of it right there and then, took a bite of the ribs, announced that we were going to take it home.  It was that good.  And that much food.  My only regret was not getting more cornbread.  But I can't really blame them for not offering considering how quickly they brought us that sheer amount of food.. . In a nutshell, great, quick, and very accommodating service (the couple next to us wanted rotisserie chicken without any BBQ sauce.  Baffling, I know), delicious food, and tons of it!  But be sure to make a reservation.  Oh, and have I mentioned those cinnamon-dusted donut bites?  Bobby Q, you've ruined me forever.  I used to be very content with my after-dinner mints but now I'm going to have to demand donut bites everywhere I go.
Great bbq! Some of the best we have had. Our server, Carmella, was amazing and the rest of the staff were very friendly. Gives Texas a run for its money
It's got everything a great BBQ place needs - great selection of meats always cooked to perfection, great tasting sauce, sweet tea, Mac n cheese, sweet potatoes and peach cobbler! Service is always friendly and timely. As a native Texan who lives here in the valley this is the best place I've found. The only negative is the location.
Wow...where do I start.... AMAZING food EVEN BETTER service! . Donnie was our server and he was more than happy to offer solid suggestions for drinks and food. Ordered the "Whole Hog Heaven" and split it (enough food for 3 people).  The baby backs were fall-off-the-bone delicious,  brisket, chicken, and St. Louis ribs were smoked to perfection. Tried the spicy sauce,  so goood!  Dessert was totally worth it. I absolutely recommend Bobby Q's.  I'll be back every time I'm in Phoenix.
One of the best places I have ever eaten. Definitely a place where you want to stop for awesome bbq fix. Excellent service. Warning: pork ribs will melt in your mouth. staff meet you with courtesy. Excellent outdoor place for good eating and socializing. Thebest recipe for a great night sleep!
Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!
I just came from LA to Phoenix for a business trip. I searched yelp and found this place interesting. . . I have been trying many steakhouses in beverly hills and LA but this place is amazing. . . I ordered brisket with corns and veggies. I literally finished the whole plate.. . Chelsea, the bartender, was awesome. I love her. She's so sweet and kind and best service ever.
This is my most favorite restaurant. I always come for my birthday and special occasions and have never been let down. The southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes are my favorite but the steak, baked potato and Mac and cheese are also awesome!
Bobby Q never disappoints.  They serve the best chocolate martinis and I have  one or two every visit.  I usually order steak or BBQ combo. Tonight I tried the fried chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy.  Another winner.
Guys! This place is fantastic. I can't go anywhere else for steaks and ribs! . . Carmela, my server, was super nice and informative on restaurant and menu. Thank you dear!
