This place is very good. But also very crowded especially late at night after the clubs start to clear. I ordered the adobada tacos which was their version of all pastor. It was very tasty and filled with meat. A pretty good deal for two bucks per taco. I didn't have a chance to try any of their other meats because of the way their lines are set up but I don't know if I need to get anything other than the adobada. Not the best tacos ever but they are very very good.
Love the freshly grilled and seasoned meats.  Adobada and asada are excellent - especially with the creamy green sauce!! Tiny tacos pack a punch of flavor.
Awesome tacos and asada fries very friendly people very good price considering its on the strip will come back for more every time I visit!!!
Best food on the strip
Best tacos in Vegas.  I've visited this place in Mexico and San Diego (it's a small chain), and this place is just as good.  The al pastor is their best.  The buche is too wet for my liking.  Make sure they have handmade tortillas or it's not the same.  The tacos are small and expensive, as I can eat 5-6.  With drink, that'll come out to around $15.  Get a plate of free scallions and jalapenos, you just need to ask.  . . Very confusing ordering process for a first timer, as there are separate lines for the al pastor and other meats.  This location is very busy which ensures a quick turnover of their food, keeping things fresh and safe.. . The quality of the food qualifies for a 5 rating, but factoring in the price nets this place a 4.
Way too salty! Coulda been the meat or salsa..Was expecting better from all these reviews...
Excellent food. Fast service. Nice help. Limited menu. No chicken. My wife & I happened upon this simple fast paced authentic mexican restaurant while on vay-kay in Vegas last week.  The chef was helpful, friendly and made us a quick variety of food. Very casual. Muy delicioso!
My favorite tacos ever are here. If I could only one thing for the rest of my life it would be the Pastor from Tacos El Gordo. I especially love the Pastor fries.
Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. . . I think I ate that many. I cannot recall how we ended up here after an evening of (redacted)...nothing much.. . Stood in a line with a bunch of loud drunks. Our group split up to get a variety of eats from the different stations. 4th meal fun.
First time here on my lunch break.... Poor customer service for Non Spanish speaking or reading customers. When asking the cashier information as to how to order she was very rude, "The lines are according to the type of meat you want! Can't you read it!?!" If I could I wouldn't be asking....
This place is POPPIN' even more than the day clubs and night clubs in Vegas. If you're a foodie and you've been to Vegas more than once but have not yet stopped into this spot for some super duper authentic Mexican tacos, SHAME ON YOU.. . I love that the tacos are still priced pretty decently even in this craycray economy we're in ($2 a taco).. . They also have quesadillas, burritos, tostadas, etc. . . I've had the Carne Asada, Chicken and of course the Lengua tacos here. BOMB.. The salsas they use and offer are also BOMB.. . Like I said, this place is always POPPIN'. So don't be alarmed if you're walking into a mosh pit full of hungry or hungover Vegas visitors and/or locals.
I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego awhile back and wanted to try out the Las Vegas location. The food here was pretty good! We ordered way too much - carne asada tacos, adobada tacos, carne asada fries, and adobada fries. I liked the adobada tacos the best. The adobada was much better than the carne asada. The fries were just average as well. It was mostly smothered in cheese, sour cream, and avocado sauce. . . Lines were long but moved quickly. They have separate lines for different meats and items so you have to stand in multiple lines if you want to order various things. You can ask for grilled onions and peppers on the side.
Hands down the best Mexican anything I have ever put it my mouth! Don't be intimidated by the line just shut up stand there and wait for it!
Tacos are delicious! Very small and VERY unhealthy, but very good! The asada fries are meh, they're alright, not the best. I got one with everything on it and after eating for a while I couldn't eat anymore because the sauce was so strong. . . I came back a second time at 2:45am to eat two tacos and there was a lady at the door that told us that they were closed. We just said alright and started walking. Another group approached her after us and im not sure what they said but she let all of them in! And it was a huge group. We went back to ask her why she would let them in and not the two of us and she just laughed at us. Rude much? For the record, they close at 3am, so im not sure why she was so rude to us.
Make sure you're in the right line when ordering because the people behind you will be pissed! Lol! The tacos here are delish!!! OMG. I usually go to the Charleston location because there's more parking but this location is awesome !!!!
Is it weird that my favorite taqueria is in Las Vegas?  This place is awesome, and when I say awesome I mean life changingly awesome.  . . The meats here are delicious and watching the cooks work their stations here is nothing short of impressive.  They are so freakin' fast! The food is really why you are here, and it doesn't disappoint.. . The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try. . . The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada. Don't forget the real guacamole on top as well!. . Oh yeah, did I mention the sauces? I have no idea what a lot of them are, but man, do they make the meats sing!!!  . . Everything is good here, even the marinated veggies that come on the side of the plate.  . I am glad that this place is so far away from home, because if it wasn't, I'd have to buy bigger clothes!
It's a taco joint alright. At 230 am there was a line out the door. we tried the pastor and Diablo and they were great. I have heard about this place for a minute and can't believe I haven't been here sooner. great for any time of the day for a quick bite. if you are coming for service and plated food you will be disappointed.  but if you are coming for good mexican food and an experience you are at the right spot! highly recommended....
4:00 am tacos? check. . Tacos el Gordo definitely has the right idea about tacos. Unfortunately, having had some great tacos in LA and south of the border, I can say they aren't quite top tier. That being said, they are one of the best taquerias in Las Vegas. I would come back, but if a King Taco ever opens in the city, there would be no contest. . . Pros:. -Good price, open late. -Lengua and cabeza held their own; both were cooked well, moist, and flavorful, if a bit under-spiced. -Their red sauce/salsa was great. -"insert meat choice" fries. . Cons. -The adobada, which they are apparently known for, was chewy, dry, and pretty lacking in any flavor whatsoever (resembling styrofoam perhaps). -The ordering situation is, well, a situation. Be prepared to wait three times as long if you happen to want meets from three different stations.
Thanks to my fellow tellers and my love for tacos, I had to come here! I came during the luck hour so it wasn't so busy. However I still became a little confused about te ordering window for what meat you want. I was going by the menu and not by the tiny little clear sign under the menu that reads what kind of meat that person is making. I love how they had two sides to place making it easier and faster to order.. . I got the carne asada tacos with everything. I loves them. Reminded me of the tacos I use to eat in TJ. My bf on the other hand didn't care for them. He felt they were bland. I will agree that the meat was bland but who needs seasoning when you have salsa?!. . I wish they had more locations so I wouldn't have to travel to the strip just for some great tacos. I will be coming back for more!
So after THREEfreakin times trying here, we finally on the 4th time just said lets do it. We came at 0330 one time.. Line out the door. We came at 1100 on a Sunday morning, line out the door. We came a 3rd time... Guess where the line was... Yup. . This 4th time we were like dude, I hate lines and am so starving but omg this place must be amazing if it's getting this kinda business, right? Right. . I can't promise you'll love it. So I can't promise it's worth the wait of the long lines. It's definitely authentic. The cooks/preparers are very kind and efficient. Friendly. Nobody starting sh*t or acting crazy. Living in El Paso, I CAN say I've had better... However I CANNOT say I've had better in Las Vegas. Cheap, on the strip, good "drunk food". . Tacos (for a dude my size) are smaller so order a few. My Japanese wife, who barely clocks in at 100lbs, ate 4. It was tough of course but she still finished all 4. So you see what I mean... Big dude with big appetite? Get about 6... Not kidding. Everyone seemed to love it. Didn't see any sour faves or disappointed kids etc... I mean it is what it is. Locally it's obviously the dope biz... I guess I'm immune to it because of where I live, which is basically Ciudad Juarez lol...of course it's El Paso Texas, but you wouldn't know that from the license plates you see. But I'm cool with it, border towns got the bomb food! . Go to Tacos El Gordo... Get a few, try it out. Won't break the bank. Worth it. I say 3 stars, but Let the long lines and overall rating on yelp guide you.
This place is awesome. Come early or be prepared to wait in line. A little unorganized and parking is crazy in the mini mall lot but overall this place is recommended when you're in Las Vegas and are craving authentic tacos.
i am a 23 latino man who has had tacos all his life. i can honestly say that these tacos are on of my top three all time best. there is always a giant line for a reason. you can see a sence of pride in the food these guys make. i dont like the fact that there is never any seats and that the lines are way too long but the tacos are so great that i must give this play a perfect rating.
Went here with my old lady, it was pretty amazing. The tortilla was good. . 2 carne asada tacos. 1 shoulder taco. 1 tongue taco. 1 carne asada tostada- this was the worst one- I would pass on it. 1- orange whip drink. . $13. . It was all good, they didn't have salsa and jalapenos. This is where you meet ghetto and club goers milleniums
I have been meaning to go to Tacos El Gordo for quite some time now. I have seen in other reviews that the lines are long, but worth the wait.. I went on a Tuesday at 2:00PM for lunch.. I walked in and there was only 2 other people in front of us in line.... Yay!. I got the adobada tacos and asada tacos with everything.. They were really good!!! The adobada were my favorite!!!. I will definitely be back.!!!
Went here with the wife from a lot of people talking about it and was highly disappointed we got carne asada fries and some spicy pork tacos, the tacos were decent at best but the carne asada was the worst tasting ever it tasted like it was blasted with gas or something I cant place it but theres no way it could always taste like that and have such good reviews absolutely horrible we will never be back
I don't think I've ever gone to a place for Dinner, went to do other stuff and then come back to the same place for Second Dinner. That's how good these tacos are.  . . We had abodaba, tongue, and shoulder (over the course of our two visits) all with everything.  The adodaba comes with pineapple and somehow that makes it even better!  . . The line was longer at 9pm, but it still moved rather quickly.  Do note there are several  lines each making a couple kinds of tacos, not just one line and you can get fries at any of those. . . Super delicious.  Totally affordable. Can't wait to go back.
If you're planning a trip to Vegas, take note: this place will feed you when you've lost all your money to gambling, overpriced meals and club entry. And they will feed you well. I think we went 3 times during our 5 day stay. Just so darn good. Very authentic. And most importantly for Vegas, dirt cheap.
Alright alright - who's this hater giving Tacos El Gordo 3 stars? I mean, it averages 4.5 stars over 1100 reviews - so who's this guy giving it 3?. . Yes - it is a cheap eat in Vegas.. Yes - there are great tacos here.. Yes - there is quite an assortment of meats here.. Yes - they're pretty quick. Yes - everyone and their moms eat here because of everything that everybody raves about.. . But.. I just didn't think it was THAT great. My wife loved it - in fact, we ate here twice during the 2-day stay we had in Vegas. I guess I've just been spoiled with the availability of great tacos at a cheaper price in LA, that I didn't see what the hoopla of Tacos El Gordo is/was.. . It's a solid option, especially if you're up drinking, partying, clubbing, or doing whatever else Vegas has to offer, and it's late, and you want something to eat. They're great at what they do, I just didn't think it was as amazing as it was overhyped to be.. . I got the buche, the cabeza, and the lengua tacos. Each taco had a lot of meat. The lady had an asada vampiro. She was satisfied with her choice. . . She did make the remark that everything about Tacos el Gordo was legitimately Mexican i.e. the layout, staff, products, and even the patrons [all walks of life] - just that the price wasn't quite Mexican, meaning, you're paying more for the same product. I guess the price was the biggest turn off for me, since there are $1 taco places near my childhood home that offer the same quality goodness that is a taco.. . Was it good? Yes. Great? Mmmmm.....
Best Tacos in Vegas!! I love this place! I haven't been back to Robertos since I discovered El Gordo! The spicy pork tacos are theeeee best...seriously!! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the lines are always crazy. Its well worth the wait!!
The best place for carne asada tacos, they have many choices. Worth the wait in line. The employees are friendly.  Order in line and pay in a different makes it quicker.
The most bang for your buck!! I love that the tacos are only a dollar each, I payed 8$ for a meal that filled me up more than I thought it would. They don't short you on the meat either. The staff is also friendly and very Mexican lol or should I say "authentic." The only complaint of mine would be that its hot as ballz inside there but that's what adds to the authentic experience.
Talk about Tacos!!! . Welcome to the mother land, nothing like a Mexican subway!! Love their tacos, everything is cooked to perfection; one of my favorite taco places in Vegas!! . It's a little crowded but hey more people too mingle with, enjoy.
Best drunk food ever. I always make a stop over here when I visit Vegas. Lines can get out of hand at times but it's worth the wait. Seating is a bitch though. I always get the vampiro, 4 al pastor tacos and the fries. You can't go wrong with that.
Tacos a fantastic. Specially the Al Pastor.  If you want authentic Tijuana tacos without  the TJ thrill, this is the place to go.    Place is very clean and all employees are very friendly.
so good and worth it just gets a little full but for the most part its speedy although crowded it was better and cheaper than hotel food and close enough to walk
