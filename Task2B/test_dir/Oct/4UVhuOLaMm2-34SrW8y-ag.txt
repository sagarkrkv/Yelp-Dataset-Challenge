Good food ridiculously bad service. To the point it became funny to us. . . They couldn't get our orders straight for an entire hour and had waitresses circling several times always needing us to correct them. . . Food was good. One plate was dry because it sat out for 20 minutes. . . A roll was sent to another table. When they said they didn't order it. Waitress brought it to my table. One persons food came 40 min after everyone else's. had to ask for water several times. Forgot our coffee which is astronomical 4.50 for a plain coffee! When the bill came they didn't even tally up the items which were nonsensical. . We don't tip for "oh we're sorry, so sorry". . This place really went downhill since last year. Management needs revamping bad!
Somehow we ended up with 50 per person.. we didn't even order the alcohol.. Their sake infused cocktail looks interesting and I forgot my ID in my car and didn't bother to go and get it after R2R. What a bummer.. The food is good, but not good enough to make me to want more. Hmm doesn't worth to come again I believe.. The grilled squid is a bit too dry. The rest of the kabob are ok.
Great food! Great environment! Good service. This is a great place to try something new! Each time you go if something looks appetizing ask what it is so you know what to order next time. :) Cons, smells kinda funny. Overwhelming amount of options and it has been shut down afew times due health code violations. I have yet to get sick tho.
Yellowtail Tar Tar! Need I say more?! I could eat this all day. ALL DAY!! . I came here quite awhile ago so I can't really remember all that I ate but I DO remember THAT much. Just come here for that!! Nom nom! . Oooh and the sashimi was VERY good too! Fresh and delicious tasting! . . . . I think they keep getting shut down by the SNHD though so......
Food is suck, I'm whiting my food like 50min then......
So good! I can not wait to go back with another group (which you need so you can try as many dishes as possible). My sister is a ramen snob and loved their ramen. The black cod was exceptional as was their yellowtail tostadas. Service was incredibly fast and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you want to entertain out of town guest!
It used to be my favorite place. But the service is getting really bad. It feels like they just want to get your order, get your food then clean up the dish get your bill and then get out of here. Dont think we will come back again.
Sitting here right now, used to love this place......what happened to the service ? This place nose dived :/ pisses me off, I loved this place
the food here is on point! (can't go wrong in general if the food is on a skewer and/or fried). great place for izakaya & yakitori, make sure to inquire about the daily specials.
Came here late, like around 1am with a party of 3. They were packed. The place is located  in the heart of Chinatown on the upstairs. . . The location is small. Definitely not suitable for BIG groups. They can probably accommodate and make it work, but it's snug there. . . Very very very authentic menu. I recommend ordering from the "menu" on the wall. They even have a menu in all Japanese, so this place is traditional as it comes. You can pretty much can order anything and they will make it how you request and order it. Just don't know how much they will charge.  . . The raw shaken beef appetizer is a must try. Very very  delicious and it doesn't taste raw... It just melts in your mouth. . . We also salmon nigiri. Super fresh tasting. We also had udon and seaweed salad. Definitely a different way the seaweed is presented and prepared. . . Everything taste wonderful here and definitely very traditional. It's a bit on the expensive side but it's Japanese so it's expected. But definitely worth it.
Have been going there for about 3 years. I usually go there to get some cold beers. I lalways get draft Kirin Ichiban. They offer great variety of foods and desserts. Employees are very attentive and kind.
