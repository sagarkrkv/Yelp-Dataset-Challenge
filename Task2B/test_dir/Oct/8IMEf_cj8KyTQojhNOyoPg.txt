Not impressed. With all the casino options in Vegas, go elsewhere. We stayed at the Rio because that was where the convention was. When we made the reservation we had upgraded to a king size bed and a room with a view (weeks before arriving) but when we arrived we were told that none were available because they don't hold single bed rooms, but that the next day we could switch rooms and that they would call us. Check in took close to 20 minutes. The next day we didn't receive a phone call. . . The room was good size and the big windows were a saving grace because the room wasn't super clean and the carpet had a bunch of stains. The shower head would sting your skin it was so strong and there was no happy medium. The room does NOT have a microwave. And by day 3 I called the front desk because I couldn't take the fridge completely FREEZING any food put in there. Luckily the maintenance man arrived within minutes and took only seconds to fix. It took longer trying to thaw my food.... . Huge annoyance... expect to pay for wifi and the gym facilities unless you pay extra because these items are NOT included in the price of the room. Also no outside food delivery are allowed inside the hotel. So be prepared to walk to the front entrance to pick it up.
So, my room was Hideous.  Forest Green naugahyde tufted headboard and drapes that were a throw back to the 70-80's...Really?   Perhaps the rooms in the Masquerade tower have not yet been renovated?   On a positive spin, Loved the Casino, the games were great!   And the restaurants were also very good.  Really liked the Grill and the Dim Sum place was Bar-None.  Will definitely come back for a visit to the casino but will most likely stay at another hotel, the pics on the website are very deceptive.
stayed a few years ago and thanks to the "amentaties" i am now a married woman to a man who has been my best friend since I was 19.  Yes, there are those days i feel one of us should pack a bag and go back (j/k) but while we had a wonderful time i felt the carpets were dated and the entertainment was almost sub-par for what vegas has to offer.
Please improve the cleanliness of your rooms and sanitize your hotel. We need better customer service who can pay more attention to a customer's CONCERN without giving me attitude in what SHE CAN DO FOR ME. I asked for the hotel manager that night because the house keeping grave yard "manager" in charge that Friday night, October 4th, AM in the morning, was not compliant as I expected her to be. I found a cockroach in my room next to my HEAD on the couch! She said there was nothing they can do to make my stay better other than sending a house keeper to come up to KILL the roach.  She did not offer me a better room nor did she address my concern or offer any sort of compensation or upgrade until I requested for the Hotel Manager and made our conversation awkward because I kept asking her, "are you serious? there's nothing you can do?!". When I called front desk about it, all they did was inform me that housekeeping is on their way. Housekeeping took 15 minutes to reach my room and by that time, I had to kill it before it reached my bags and luggage because it started to walk downwards off the wall to the carpet! This made me think how unsanitary this place is! We walk barefoot on the carpet.  We sit on the carpet. How do you know if these cockroaches laid eggs or laid droppings on the beds, carpet and the fact that they can crawl into my luggage in the middle of the night is absolutely disturbing! I do not need to bring cockroaches home and infest my whole house because of RIO's cockroach situation! We were on the 3rd floor! Can you imagine how large of an infestation of cockroaches you have on the first floor in your kitchens and restaurants! I eat at those restaurants! I have been a loyal customer to RIO since I can last remember and this type of situation and customer service needs to be brought up to Human Resources! Had I not asked for the Hotel Manager, I would have not gotten another room.  The weird thing is it ended up to be the last room down the longest hall ever on the 14th floor. Was that a coincidence or on purpose because I found a cockroach in your room? The Hotel Manager should have given us a Suite or some sort to make me forget what I experienced.  Either way, thank YOU to the hotel manager who gave us a new room (I will ignore the fact that it was the last room on the hall).  As for the GRAVE YARD "HOUSE KEEPING MANAGER" that night, you need a GOOD COACHING or WRITE UP for being the most unfriendly MANAGER at RIO!  I will post this on social media sites thanks to you!!
There may have been a time when the Rio was a decent place to stay. Based on my experiences the past four years, this was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It's convenient to stay there during the Star Trek convention, but every time I have problems that make my stay miserable.. . This past trip (August 2014):. . We learned that the bartenders at Shutters and Masquerade were rounding up charges! For example, if you got a receipt with your beer, it showed $7.11 .. but they charged $7.25 or $7.50. Long story short, I worked my way up to their SVP of Legal who said it was NOT a corporate policy to do this (even though I found out they don't have small coins in the cash drawers ... hmm) and it was an "isolated incident' even though more than two dozen people confirmed my findings. I think they get enough of our money, but to cheat us as well? Reprehensible.. . 1. Tiny closet with four hangars in it.. 2. Called housekeeping for more hangars, took an hour to arrive, and some didn't fit the closet rack.. 3. No ashtrays in a smoking room, and when requested, took 90 minutes for them to arrive.. 4. Air conditioning return duct was clotted with dust and filth (allergies went off the chart as soon after I arrived). 5. Overall room is mediocre ... I asked for a great room based on prior year issues, and they gave me a Mountain View King Samba Suite. It looks like it was decorated by a sightless, color blind person. Not the "fabulous" room I was promised.. 6. They call them suites, but really it is a slightly oversized hotel room with a wall.. 7. Don't look behind the TV/refrigerator cabinet unless you like viewing dirt and dust from the Reagan years.. 8. A refrigerator! Great!! Except it froze all the food I put in there.. 9. Minibar was not serviced before I arrived, and there was a half-eaten Rice Krispie bar in there from the prior tenant.. 10. "High Speed Wifi" is not what they offer. Speeds are slower that dial up! If you are tech-savvy: I ran a speed test and download speed was 1.5; upload was .75. Yes. POINT SEVEN FIVE!! (Run a speedtest.net on your own and compare.) When I complained they admitted they had to upgrade their system. This is not only atrocious but false advertising - especially as they are aware of the issue.. 11. Tub stopper broken. . . These are just the issues I recall. Basically, unless you are spending less than $50 a night at this property, you are paying too much. I'm  never staying there again.
For the value you get it's five stars.  Room is large & well kept, restaurants are decent & off strip cost, pool/spa are very nice.   For $80/night how can you go wrong.
We got the Presidential Suite on the 51rst floor for a bachelor party.. . The room was amazing. 3500+ square feet, private pool on the balcony... amazing view.. . The reason for the 2 stars is this:. . 1. the sound system was shot- i mean, really shot. We brought our own jambox which covered.... . 2. the service downstairs. we got a few other basic rooms because there were so many of us. they messed up over and over with all the keys.. it was a nightmare.. . 3. they offered a limo to pick us up from the airport with booking the suite. the limo never came, and I had to order a limo last minute.. . The hotel sucked for nightlife, especially if your in your 20's. The room was amazing, the hotel was crap.. . I would recommend spending 2k more, and getting a better location.
It had been about 10 years since we stayed here. The property has definitely gone downhill in that time. It is a good value for the money; however, you should not expect a 5 star experience. The room was in disrepair. I had to call maintenance within 10 min of our arrival because the safe didn't work. So, I had to hang out and wait for the person to come and fix it. New batteries were all that was needed. Simply having a safe check on the housekeeping checklist would have been all that was needed to avoid this problem. Next things we discovered is the hair dryer in the room didn't work. We called. No one came. We called again. No one came. We found a maid in the hallway, she called. No one came. Finally on the fourth call, a guy came and replaced the hair dryer. He also noticed the outlet was loose in the wall and put in a maintenance request for that as well. One of the mattresses in the room was completely collapsed on one side. I called about that and they offered a room change but could not guarantee the view so we elected to tough it out with the crappy bed. The alarm clock in the room next door started going off about 9pm on the first night of our stay. We called about that. It finally got turned off about 3 hours later. Hard to get kids to bed with an alarm clock going off in the next room. Our alarm clock went off in the middle of the night as well. Seems like someone thought it would be funny to set the alarms clocks to go off. Not the hotel's fault on that issue. The pool area is in an extreme state of deferred maintenance. The concrete around the edge of their sandy beach pool was cracking and the chicken wire underneath was exposed and sharp edges were visible. The material under the sand was also exposed and creating a trip hazard. We still had a good stay. The kids loved the place and didn't notice any of these issues. This is an aging property which has not been well maintained over the years. I talked to a manager about all these issues and she said she's give us a late checkout the next day and credit our account $50 for the trouble. When I went to check out the $50 had not been applied, so I had to call and talk with another manager. She increased the credit to about $60 to cover all the "resort fees". They charge a $24/day resort fee for the wifi (which works very poorly) and the fitness center which is also in great need of updating. All-in-all a successful stay at the Rio. Get a strip view room. Without the great view, there is absolutely NO reason to stay here.
Very nice accommodations.  But it just absolutely fries my cackles that they provide s beautiful keurig  coffeemaker, HOWEVER, the coffee packets are in the mini bar, thus you incur an additional charge should you desire a coffee at rise and shine time.  WTF!!  They just proved to be complete a-holes!  I may stay again, but I will bring my own coffee.  Dicks. That's why I prefer a Holiday Inn Express that actually appreciates my business.
Stayed 2 comp'd nights at the Rio Oct 6 & 7 (mon & tues).  This was our 2nd time at the hotel.    Check-in line was about 8 deep at 730pm.  Line moved quickly  as there were about 6 associates working.  Janeesa cheerfully checked us in with enthusiasm and made us feel welcomed.  Rooms are beautiful, very roomy and room service is great (Creme Brulee-is deeeelish).  Being that the rooms are mini-suites, it offsets the fact that you are not on the strip.  However there is a shuttle that runs to and from the strip-we didn't use it though.  The casino has a wide variety of games, poker room is rather small for WSOP hotel, but does the job.  Drink service is slow-after 11pm on the casino floor-can't speak to any other time, because I tend to only gamble after 11pm.  They have a wide variety of shops, sundry store is open 24 hours, the one located by the Ipanema towers (which are closer to the front).  No arcade for kids.  Nice pool area though. Note: 2 queen beds cost more per night.  Nice property to stay, didn't come across any "street people", felt safe and secured.  Overall mood of the casino was OK.
I have stayed at many a hotel in my life in Las Vegas. Each one notable within the time frame and age.  But I have to tell you about the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. This was probably the best stay I have had in a long time. The rooms were large, updated, clean and comfortable. A nice choice of restaurants to meet every budget. A nice ambiance and feeling amongst the staff. Located away from the strip, but for those who want to be a part of the bustle, a free shuttle is available every half hour. The pool area is inviting, including a sandy beach. Plus, was able to actually go home with winnings in my pocket. I will definitely stay there the next time around.
A large room that could use some updating. The hotel isn't bad for the price. If your going to stay here make sure it's a good deal for the price they add on in the resort fee there is better options.
Stayed here because there was a festival I was going to and this was where the shuttle pick up and drop off was so I thought - convenient! For being right off the strip, the prices of mediocre food was high - I get it, there aren't many choices, doesn't mean you have to gouge your customers at every chance. I prepaid my room and then I came to find out there's an additional 'resort fee.' Rooms are ok at best. Just find a place on the strip, this place is not worth the hassle or the price.
Convention time.. Twice a year I go to a Safety Convention run by our insurance company. Our group has grown steadily. 10 years ago we were the 7th company to join, today there are 200 companies. Being so big, we need a big place. This years venue the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. . . It's a big hotel, able to accommodate a group like ours (about 150 participants). Our group was the small one. Another group had over 1,000 participants. Yikes. . . The Room:. 800 sq ft in area. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Living area had a sofa and a work desk. Flat screen TV, mini bar, refrigerator, safe, hair dryer,  iron & ironing board were the amenities they had in the room. All in all, a nice place to relax after a long day of work. . . The Convention:. Big rooms to accommodate us. . We had breakfast and lunch catered by the hotel. The food was good, but nothing special. . It is a long long walk to get to the convention area from the hotel. . . The Restaurants. The Rio has quite a few of them. . They have 2 buffets. The famous Carnival buffet and the Seafood buffet. I've tried both and they are both very good.. . Martorano's is an Italian restaurant. We had our group dinner here and food was great. It's served family style so it good for a group. . . They also have a dim sum (KJ Chinese Dim Sum), Indian (Royal India Bistro), seafood (Buzios), breakfast (Hash House A Go Go) & steak (Voo Doo Steak House) restaurants inside the Rio. . . The Casino. All the casino games you expect. They also have a sports book area to bet on games. . . The Rio is off the Strip. They offer 2 free shuttles to their sister casinos on the Strip. One goes to Bally's and the other one goes to Harrah's. There is a return shuttle from both of those casino back to the Rio. It operates every half hour. . . I really enjoyed my time here. . The convention space was huge. . The room are nice and clean. . The restaurant inside the hotel were a plenty. . The casino area was vibrant and fun. . A Las Vegas experience indeed.
great hotel. the breakfast ham steak is the best I've ever had. large portions and they even cook your eggs perfectly in olive oil if requested. daily maid service is prompt and friendly. rooms are always nice with kuerig coffee makers in room. pool is nice too. 3 stars as I wish they would offer free wifi & get better air circulation for the smoking.
Everytime I come to vegas I stay at one of the ceasars properties. The rio has always been good cause the room as pretty big and usually pretty nice. I upgraded to the so called samba luxury suite. Don't waste your money, get the regular suite. All they have done to this room is put a couple of colorful pictures up, changed the carpet and a new headboard. When I put my clothes away the closet door would not open and there was trash inside the dressers. Check in was not very friendly, but I think it was just that person cause everyone else in the property was really nice. This property is off the strip but they do have a free shuttle. Overall it was an ok stay and I would stay again. I just wouldn't be paying the extra for the samba room.
Came here for a convention during the week for my job.  For how big it was and how much money was spent, it was very disappointing! I was shocked to discover it was an add'l $13.99 a night for Wifi and $24 if you wanted to use other amenities' like the spa and gym.  Maybe I am spoiled but I have always found it to be a given. My coworker and I got rooms across the hall from each other.  She says hers smelled funny.  I thought maybe it was because we were on the smoking floor but no, it did smell funny.  It smelled like a mixture of stale smoke and sewer.  As a matter of fact several parts of the casino had that sewer smell esp out by the shuttle area.  She tried it out and couldn't take it so asked for another room the next morning.  They said she would have to wait til 3pm when the rooms were cleaned but before 6pm before they get all checked out.  WTF???  so we couldn't go anywhere and that was our only free night. Then the room itself was pretty beat up that they seem to find acceptable.  While the AC worked well, it was extremely loud and noisy.  Not a hum but a rattling that kept waking me up when it would kick on.   My flat screen TV was visibly crooked with wires hanging all about. I tried to straighten it but it was stuck there crooked.  The lamp was cracking.  Furniture edges were worn/chipped.  The shower has two vertical nozzles that 'once' had a cover and now its these two rubber things protruding from the wall.  Looked awful.   It is off the strip but they offer a shuttle to go to their sister properties on the strip Ballys or Harrahs.  Both properties are pretty far from the Luxor or Stratosphere.  The food here is very expensive if you just want a small bite to eat.  Even the burger king was pricey if you want to spend $7 for a whopper.   The only positive that this hotel has going for them is the size of the room is very spacious and the gaming had a decent variety.  I would never stay here voluntarily again.  They also nickel and dimed our company for silly charges after bringing in over 1000 ppl in attendance.  We did go back to another person to try and get my friend a room replacement earlier rather than later and she was very helpful and friendly and why I am giving 2 stars and not 1.   See my pics!
Pleasantly pleased with this hotel! Got a great price last minute and my room was huge!! Pretty big bathroom and sectional in my room with partial view of the strip! Couldn't beat this at $38 a night! Very easy to get too and the front desk was very nice! Def recommend.
I like the Rio, it's clean and kept nice, but the only thing that kills it for me each time I stay here is that it's a bit far from the strip. I know they've got their shuttle service and all, but when you're a drunken bum, having to walk or take a cab back to your hotel could be a bit of a buzzkill sometimes. The actual place itself is great!  My only complaint is the location itself, which really is NOT that far away from the strip, but not being able to do what I want right away is what I just find inconvenient.
I stayed at the Rio this past summer with my best friend for her birthday.. We paid a great amount for a Friday and Saturday night strip facing room.. The room was awesome, call me simple but I loved the big suite, huge couch and giant windows with a strip view.. We had a blast, no problems with staff, our room or anything else.. Will definitely stay here again soon!
