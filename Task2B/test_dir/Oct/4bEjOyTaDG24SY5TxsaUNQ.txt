We had our wedding reception in the Cafe Halle room (private dining room) at Mon Ami Gabi this past Saturday (9/27). They did such a great job. I was worried about how it would turn out considering it was a destination wedding.  The communication between our event planner, Dusty, was exceptional.  Every time I wrote her an email or called her she replied or answered within an hour or so.  The food was delicious!  We had our guests choose between the filet, salmon, or chicken and one of my guests (who is a professional chef) said it was the best wedding reception food he had ever had. They were able to set up a projector so we could do a slide show.  They also included a bottle of champagne for my husband and I to enjoy after the event.  The room was a good size for our group (we had 25 guests).  It is too small for dancing or live music, so if that is important to you this place may not work.  We chose to have a luncheon reception at 3pm versus having a dinner for two main reasons.  First off, the luncheon food and beverage minimum is half that of the dinner minimum.  Second, 3pm vegas time is dinner time on the East coast (which is where most of our guests came from).  We were able to customize our menu and select dinner entrees instead of lunch entrees.  Pricing was very fair and accurate.   We were very happy with how everything turned out and I would not hesitate to recommend them as an exceptionally excellent venue for a smaller (less than 30 guests) wedding reception!
Before hitting the road to return home, my family and I decided to have our final Vegas meal here at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was an adorable french style restaruant with an outside dining area that was identical to the parisian sidewalk cafes.  It was packed so we ended up sitting inside, which worked out well since we were hungry and had no time to waste waiting on an outdoor table.  The menu had a couple of different items that looked appetizing, such as salads and sandwiches, but I decided to order the Quiche Lorraine.  When the food came out, my quiche looked fluffy and delicious. It tasted great and I had no complaints, but my sister was a different story.. . My sister ordered the same thing as me, only her quiche was flat and over cooked.  When she cut it open the inside looked nothing like my fluffy, yellow, perfectly cooked pie.  She ended up sending it back and ordering another one, which was much better but still not quite on par with mine.  Aside from the quiche issue and the fact that it took a while tor our food to be delivered, we enjoyed our time there.
Very friendly, attentive staff, great food and venue. Outdoor patio is always packed so be ready to wait if that's your desired seating. We opted to sit inside which they sat us down very quickly. Definitely recommend it
Great for sunday brunch, really lovely outside seating reminds me of being in Europe. The food is super good and the staff really nice!
Great atmosphere IF you sit outside or the sun room. The indoor dining was so dark and cold.. The coffee was bitter or old we had to return it.. The eggs Benedict was amazing. They must use grass fed butter. Holy moly! . The French toast was made out of magic bread! I couldn't wrap my head around it. Amazing !
Two things I can recommend from Mon Ami (1) Baked Goat Chees App (2) The French Sangria both will leave a lasting impression. Oh and the view on the outdoor patio beautiful especially with the Bellagio show in the back round.
Sat outside in view of the Bellagio fountains and the passers by. The bread was great, the house salad was really fresh and delicious. The onion soup was far too sweet for my taste so I would not order that again, but the steak frites was delicious! Sadly, didn't have any room for the creme brulee.
Wherever you are, eat where locals eat... this is not one of them...service is terrible,  and food is a long way from being 100% French... just another tourist trap....
The food and service here was great. We all enjoyed our meals. Awesome view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio. Fresh Baguettes were amazing. Friendly helpful people working there. Would recommend.
Went for lunch and we had the Quiche Lorraine and lobster roll. Food was very good, and prompt. Service was a bit slow, but tell yourself you are in Europe and savor the longer experience. If weather is good, try to get the outside patio. You will get a view of the Bellagio water show and lots of people watching on the strip. Heads up that they not take reservations for the outside seating, indoor only, it is first come first serve.  Also of note, they were offering a gluten free menu for those with allergies or sensitivity.  Not sure what was on it, forgot to ask to see it, but it was listed on regular menu.
My fiancee and I went there back in May when we were in Vegas. The food was incredible! The only downside was our service. We were both out of water for awhile and, despite the fact that there were server assistants walking by us with water pitchers and one looking right at us and our table as he walked by, we went about 15 minutes with nothing to drink.
Best Eggs benedict I have ever had, on the patio with mimosas watching the Bellagio Fountain Show - it does not get better than this for a upscale breakfast.
One of the fanciest and prettiest breakfasts that I ever had (Instagram friendly), make sure to get there early to get a table outside. Went there twice during our stay in Vegas and definitely coming back next time. Quite on the pricey side but reasonable for what you get!
Been here at least 4 or 5 times really enjoy myself. They have good selection of appetizers. Love their escargot done in this cilantro garlic butter mix makes it packed full of flavor. The steak frites was tasty making it even better was their bearnaise so tasty and fresh.  They have a great view if you are on the patio of the fountains at the Bellagio. Great service and a very close intimate atmosphere making it fun.
Pretty good for a hotel restaurant (Paris) with a few locations.  We had a fabulous meal for our family -- scallops, steak frites, seafood platter, wine, escargots.  Great bread with a carrot/ginger/honey spread.  Only drawback was our table right next to the very loud bar.
Mon Ami Gabi was one of the only places on my list of "must do" restaurants in Vegas. We ended up getting up quite early and I wanted a good, quality, tasty breakfast that wasn't going to be served in its wrapper. We got a cab down to the strip and headed to Mon Ami Gabi.. . This place is attached to Paris so of course it has the requisite french theme. Service was prompt and we were seated on the already pretty full patio. It was nice to be able to sit and people watch as we had our breakfast. This is one of those places where the waiters are dressed impeccably, there are white tablecloths and napkins, and condiments are brought to you in their own tiny dishes, instead of bottles, etc. Lovely experience.. . I ordered the mushroom omelette, which had brie cheese on the inside and came with super crispy hash brown strings, and a piece of brioche with cream cheese and jam on the side. Everything was perfect - the omelette was INCREDIBLE. I can't say I've ever enjoyed something for breakfast that much. Melty, oozy brie cheese inside the omelette.... man, mouth is watering just thinking about it. The crispy hash browns were great, but my boyfriend would have preferred his less crispy (he's nuts, crispy hash browns all the way). I had a glass of juice and a tea and both were very good. Our meal wasn't rushed, the servers weren't all over us. It was very much so as though we were dining on our own, which was a nice way to start the day.. . Overall, this was an incredible meal and I wish we'd come here at least one other time to try some of the lunch or dinner options. This is a must for me the next time I go to Vegas and it should be on your list too.
I know what you're thinking 5 stars for a semi chain restaurant. Its unusual, but hear me out. . I came here as part of a fairly large group that had made reservations. This was a work dinner and since everyone on the team is in different parts of the country, this was basically one of the few times we'd get to see one another. Needless to say, this led to quite a bit of moving around, seat changing and just general rowdiness on the part of our group. Our server could not have been any better. She had one of those incredible memories. All of our dishes came out at the appropriate temperature and all at the same time and were served to the correct people. This is quite a feat when you have a party of 20 people and the rest of the restaurant is packed. . I opted for the half order of mussels, some frites and a glass of rose . My mussels were cooked exactly how I like them. The white wine/shallot sauce was divine. I could've imbibed it as a cocktail. My only complaint is that i was served a couple of mussels that still had some of the beard left. I know how hard they are to clean, so I'll let it slide. The frites were the yummy, thin, Parisian kind. My boss was sitting across from me and he had steak and frites. When i looked up from my plate, he was nearly done with his. . The menu included things for the pickiest of eater and we were served with a great attitude and smile. Those things cannot usually be said about most restaurants in Paris.  We all left with full bellies, empty plates and smiles on our faces. Overall a successful evening.
Service was excellent.  Quiche was delicious.  Pomme frites are the best I've ever eaten.   Loved the atmosphere and location.  Would highly recommend when visiting Las Vegas!
Big Steaks! Get it with the fries. Nice decor. Gets packed. Make reservations and you can go ahead of the line. Best way.
Had lunch here today and say on the patio. The location was great, the view was perfect, the service fantastic. Our server's suggestions were excellent. My table got the wan goat cheese which was delicious, the warm chicken and Brie cheese (could have used more Brie) Salmon and spinach salad, quiche, and lobster roll.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I would definitely return.
Not a bad experience to date.  Though, reservations wouldn't be a bad idea.. . Order the carafe of St. Germain spritzer!  It's good with your starters.  The baked goat cheese is rich... richly EXCELLENT!  And you can't go wrong with french onion soup here (which accommodates two).. . Once your main course hits, the Duck a L'orange, filet merlot, short ribs, bone-in ribeye and the seafood platter have all been high hitters.  All things considered, the prices aren't too steep for the bonanza about to crash land on your taste buds.
Great wine list, get the salad with the poached egg, food is stellar, get outside seating during the fountain show.
My favorite breakfast in Vegas! You have to sit outside! Can't get reservations for outside...inside only. But, it's well worth the wait. Have the ham & cheese crepes! Wow...and the best coffee in town! I could eat there every morning. Perfect atmosphere on Strip, attached to Paris.
Gluten Free Bread, Gluten Free French Onion Soup, even gluten free escargot ... Ask for it! Amazing! & very encouraging to find this kind of attention to detail at a Las Vegas Casino Restaurant. The Paris has a real gem with this French restaurant.  Our waitress was Susanne & she says she has been with this restaurant since they opened. Well she was absolutely phenomenal.  She substituted whipped cauliflower and green beans almandine for frites (French fries) for a small up-charge. Ask for Susanne and be delighted by her knowledge, consideration and recommendations!  The steak was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  The escargot were very nice size, gluten free, made with fresh garlic and very buttery.  We had a great time at this restaurant and All we can say about Mon Ami Gabi is Merci.
This is a great value for Vegas!  The location is hard to beat and patio seating is even better.  The chicken liver pate was excellent, especially on the fresh and warm baguettes they bring to the table.  Scallops were pretty good, overall a great experience.
Our first stop after landing in Vegas and checking into our hotel was to find some lunch.  We had no particular plans where to eat, just knew we needed something asap.  The Paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the Mon Ami Gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.. . Service started out a little slow.  We were seated, and then waited a bit longer than expected for the server to come by.  However, our meal made up for this minor issue, as everything we both ate was very delicious.. . The free crusty bread was amazing.  Could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.. . I decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  The flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  A pure pleasure to eat.  Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.. . My husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.. . I recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.  I'd have no reservations about eating here again one day.  Was a great start to ourlast Vegas trip, for sure.
When Mon Ami first opened it was actually pretty good. I most recently went for lunch and was not pleased that it had been turned into a glorified Chilis. The waitstaff has all the flare and service standards down but they are clearly working in a churn-em out place. Several items listed on the menu were clearly for the Chili's crowd as they are NOT in line with French food. The location and view are great. If you do not go to gourmet restaurants and think Applebees is fine for dinner, you will like this place. If you want gourmet- go to Bouchon instead.
Can't make reservation for My uncle's bday and specially with all the folks and They made me wait for over 20mins for party of 9ppls and then tell me to wait another 2 hours again for seating at the patio !! Worst service ever !! Specially the host + the manager !! They serviced us the bday cake without took it out from the cake !! They need to get a little more training for customer service !! And can't believe even we spent $600 over here with 18% tip included but don't get a little good service !!! Never go back again!!!!
Food was typical overpriced Las Vegas. Service was good
Great brunch food!!! Great seating outside... wonderful customer services.... next time im on this side of the world I will return. ...
Love it, loved it. First of all my server was amazing. She was so attentive...and I was alone ..usually single tables get ignored but she was on it. I cannot remember the name of my dish because she said it really quickly then described it for me....here it goes: english muffin with a thin slice of london broil, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. yummmm....Wasnt too expensive...my meal was $16 ...because I chose the most expensive item. Coffee was $4 but amazing.
Came here for breakfast and I left very happy with my overall experience.. . Frankly you can give this place 4 stars simply for its amazing location right on the strip across from the Bellagio fountains.  The view here is great and the fact they keep even the outdoor area cool with huge blasts of AC is an accomplishment in of itself.. . The breakfast chow was pretty decent.  I had a simple ham and cheese omelet and it was good.  A nice side of potatoes helped round out the meal.  But the real attraction for me was being able to simply sit right on the Vegas strip and take in the nice street view across from the Bellagio.  Nothing is more relaxing than sipping my morning coffee while soaking in the surroundings.. . If you want something classy and somewhat refined as opposed to the usual craziness of the Vegas strip, definitely pay a visit here.  The food isn't cheap but the experience is worth the price.
went here with some girlfriends for dinner. The atmosphere is fun. The food was delicious, on time, and properly made. We had 2 bottles of champagne. Everything was reasonably priced. I also have sat outside for brunch a few times, yum! great mimosa's and eggs benedict. Servers were polite and all staff was courteous. this is a place I always suggest when friends or family are visiting vegas :)
This place is great. The food is good and the service is pretty outstanding. Definitely try the escargots!
Made a RSVP for 11.30, got there early looking to sit on the patio on this beautiful day.  The hostess were friendly and seemed like they were happy to be there. They were happy to oblige on a patio table, perfect for people watching and the Bellagio fountains across the way.  Chris greeted us promptly and offered the breakfast menu as an option. We were happy for the breakfast option, although lunch was what we mainly ordered.. . We frequently visit Mon Ami Gabi and every time we come here, the service is wonderful, the food is consistent, and ambiance is awesome. Chris made our visit, this time, very welcoming, which compelled us to review this visit. He joked with us, very attentive yet unimposing, he even poked fun at my Lover's Chicago Cubs team, rightfully so. A nice touch to personalized service and interaction with his guests, not just with us, but all of his tables, we truly appreciate that!! We also noticed Chris being a definite team player, not just servicing his tables, but cleaning and resetting his own and the other tables around him.  Bravo Chris, we'll definitely will be back to see you!
We have eaten here several times and each time was just as good as the last! . Started with the chicken liver mousse, wonderful texture and great flavor.  Next had a cup of the soup of the day; acorn squash with middle eastern spices, it was so creamy and rich.  . For the entrees, my boyfriend had the NY Strip with frites, and those frites are to die for! The frites are such a wonderful crispy salted just right awesomeness!  I will break the "no fried food" rule for those!  As for the steak, he said it was good and it must have been since there wasn't much left on the plate. . I had the warm bacon salad with a side of mac & cheese, both were great.  The salad was not overdressed and the soft egg added a wonderful creaminess to the entree. . Creme brulee for dessert, only wished that the creme part was thicker, but overall a good dessert.. Service was great as always!
Great place for lunch on a pretty afternoon.  Excellent service and food.  Love it! :-)
What a joke. Ordered the blueberry waffles. Comes with blueberries on top must have come out of the freezer so needless to say waffles cold. 2nd order comes out, blueberries on the side still cold put some butter on it and it was whipped butter it didn't even melt.  But the date glazed bacon was good !!
4 stars for atmosphere and service. If you can get a table on the patio, you have a perfect view directly across from the Bellagio fountain. It's really pretty and romantic if you're into that sort of thing. . . I ordered some appetizers (which were great) and the cold seafood platter for two. I was beyond disappointed in the dish. The lobster tasted awful, nothing tasted really fresh. Oysters were a major disappointment too. . . We should have complained after the first few bites, but didn't want to cause a scene. May return and try something different, but the other main dishes our friends ordered weren't much to write home about either.
Delicious!!!! Loved it and excellent service
My husband and I went for lunch on a Sunday.  Had a beautiful table and the food was delicious!  We shared a carafe of their sangria;  I had the quiche Lorraine and my husband had the steak classique.  Would definitely go back!
The house blend coffee was awesome.. I tried salmon poached egg and waffles both delicious.. The server was nice and social i know some people don't like it when servers talk but i am opposite i like them to be social and friendly.. Unfortunately there was a line to sit outside so we sat inside still nice cozy corner we could talk and hear each othet
5pm reservation, but immediate sitting out on patio. Saturday eve, busy as hell on the strip and additional sitting on the patio resulted crowded feeling. Thumbs up to servers maneuvering between the tight space. Nice place to people watch, but not exactly romantic until sun goes down and Bellagio fountain light up, people start to migrate into clubs and casino. Food is divine, service attentive, price affordable, comfortable atmosphere.. First time I tried stingray, fantastic. Deliciously seasoned salmon. Luv their cappuccino. If this place was off of strip, I would come here every month.
Anytime I'm in Vegas I have breakfast here. I order the same thing Blueberry French Toast and a cappuccino in a bowl. I have never been disappointed and the service is great. I will definitely be coming back!!!
I am so happy I had the chance to eat at Mon Ami Gabi during my 1st trip to Vegas. We arrived for brunch on a Wednesday and waited only 15 mins for an outside table...perfect for people watching :) I ordered the Quiche Lorraine and it was delectable. Super flaky crust and perfectly baked egg-custard inside. My tummy misses this dish! I'm excited to try dinner during my next trip.
Five star rated experience. Colby is the official best waiter I have ever had in my entire life. The escargot is highly recommended by me. It's buttery and flavorful and will melt in your mouth. The rib eye and Filet Mignon Merlot (medium well) are a must. Also, get the Riesling from France. Perfect meal in every single way.
Excellent! Brunch and Lunch are both great! Haven't ever tried dinner here, but the brunch menu and lunch menu are excellent. Chef knows their stuff! Everything was super fresh! I did try the Seafood Platter with all the oysters, shrimp and crab - it was awesome, can definitely split it between two and have plenty to eat! Mushroom soup, rocks!
The attitude of the host stinks really bad. Told us half hour wait turned out to be one hour . Avoid waiting there
I was impressed by the service here. Staff are observant, even those not serving you directly, and offer nice things like hanging up your coat, and touching up your to-go coffee before leaving.. . I ate breakfast here and our server was willing to accommodate our substitution request. We had the oatmeal, scrambled eggs and bacon, and fresh fruit. I would avoid the fresh fruit as it's a lot of melon, kind of like a continental breakfast fresh fruit.. . The oatmeal is steel cut and well made. We asked them to put apples and bananas in the oatmeal. All in all, I'd like to come here when I'm not watching what I eat and order their crepes or waffles or some other dish that is more French inspired than oats.. . I would definitely come back and given them another shot. Beautiful patio seating and is wonderful on a comfortable day. Come here around 7/8am before the crowds. Much quieter and enjoyable this way.
Really liked this place. Although it is a corporate chain, it did not feel that way at all. The service was top-knotch, the food looked and tasted great, and the bread was warm!  Add to that, the view of the Strip, and you have a great dinner before or after Jersey Boys! Well done, management!!
One time I was in Vegas with some friends and we had one of our dinners in this restaurant. There were 4 of us. The ladies who I was dining with are all extraneous about their figure, but they wanted still to enjoy a wonderful meal. First my best friend ordered her food and she wanted her meal to be cooked without oil. I was thinking, ok here we go, some complicated orders... The other two ladies told the server that they would order one filet and wanted to split it, and one wanted hers cooked medium and the other wanted hers medium well, and also cooked without oil. By this time I was hanging my head in shame and became nervous that the server would protest in some way. He said, "that's the best idea I've ever heard, excellent choice." He made us, especially the ladies, feel like they were on top of the world, and that we smelled like a bouquet of roses. . . I returned a year or 2 later, but to the restaurant upstairs. After the server took my order, all of the sudden, by the way I was feeling, I recognised the sensation. Again, I was at the top of the world, I was the best customer ever, and I smelled like roses. Impeccable, outstanding service from both Paris Hotel restaurants.
Love their french onion soup. Love their sea food platter. Love their oysters. Love their wine selection. Love sitting on the balcony on a warm evening night people watching. . Cheers.
Best place on the strip to eat in Vegas. The staff is friendly and our food was amazing!! The Nicoise Salad was fresh and delicious and my ultimate favorite dish was the Salmon tartare. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!!
Well, it was a Saturday night. I expected I'd be waiting for awhile, but believe it or not, there was no trouble accommodating me. I spoke with a manager there, and it turned out he was from my state(I live in Illinois, but happened to be visiting for the weekend), and took the time to ask me not only about my experience, but about my trip, my overall feel of the city, if I'd intended on visiting that restaurant again, and thanked me for stopping in. The man behind the bar, and I feel awful for not getting his name, he treated me like a true VIP. I ordered a Unique drink, one which many establishments might not offer, but they had it and it really "lifted my spirits" :^) . In closing, I'm glad I chose this joint. The ambience has to be among the best in the nation and I absolutely feel the level of service I received is the best I'll ever have.. Thanks for making my night special, Mon Ami Gabi. . . With love, from Illinois
I highly recommend reservations although if you want to sit outside on the patio, it is first come, first serve.. . The service is pretty good although the table next to us found it to be lacking.  I had the steak and frites which was cooked well.  Drink selection is pretty good as well.  The atmosphere is very dark and quaint- perfect for a nice night out before a show.
came here because of the reviews, so of course I wanted to try this place.  I made a reservation online and I suggest you do that before coming because there was a wait when I came during lunch.  . . ordered: . pesto escargot - the pesto was really good but I didn't like the escargot.  it was too soft.  I thought it would be a little bit more chewy or something.  . . merlot steak frites - I didn't really like this dish.  the steak was skirt steak I think?  so it was pretty thin and not of good quality.  kind of chewy.  the Merlot sauce was good though.  I also tried a piece of the classique steak and it was pretty plain.  Merlot is better.  I also liked the thin fries it came with! yummie. I love fries.
Great attention to service, excellent food and Gianna was wonderful and kind. The eggs Benedict are life changing.
Warn me next time not to ever ever sit in the patio outside late morning in October.  If you want to sit in the outside patio, I suggest you do it early morning or night.  The reason is that not all tables have covering and when sunny in Vegas, it just beats down on you.  The hostess can not guarantee if there is covering for you or not.  Our reservation was 11:30 am and we sat on the patio.  The sun was beaming on me and by time we ended, I was sweating.  Service was alittle slow and when I got my food, I just wanted to eat it so fast and go cuz who wants to eat when sweating.   I got the croque monseir and the cheese on it was melting in the sun so bad.  Granted in October the heat was not as bad as it would be in the summer, so I don't know how anyone would eat out there in the summer.  We also shared a salad with shaved asparagus and thought it was ok.  Thought the price did not justify the portion or taste.  . . I do like the bread they gave us while seated.  Other than that, I was not really  impressed.
Having lived in France and visited numerous times, I would say Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro style restaurant.  Bistros have limited menu choices, the items are usually simple, and the service tends to be quick and efficient.  The food here is decent, although a bit inconsistent at times.  But the service was anything but quick or efficient.  After we sat down it took a long time for them to take our order.  Once our orders were taken, it was 30 minutes before our country pate arrived, a dish that requires minimal preparation.  It was another long wait before our main dishes came.  My steak frites was generously portioned, cooked to my liking, and very flavorful.  My gf's seared scallops though were overly charred, and left a burned taste in our mouths.  . . Now despite the slow service, and the mishap on the food, here's why I'm giving them 4 stars --- the staff and management really took care of us.  When I made a complaint to my waiter about the scallops.  He had it replaced quickly.  Then the manager came out to apologize personally, and comp'ed the appetizers and the glass of wine.  I think that kind of attention and care to your customers is very rare these days, especially from a big and busy restaurant on the strip.  So I think they deserve a compliment for that!
I have been here at one time or another for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Each time, the food has been incredible.  The service has always been tremendous.  The people that give this place bad reviews have no clue as to what good French food is.
Right outside the Paris hotel and next to Miracle Mile.. Didn't get much food, but I can tell I already love this place.. Came in for a quick coffee & pastry run before heading to the airport.. Service was nice and fast.. Total line out the door by 10am on a Sunday.. Everyone wants to sit outside but if you're okay with sitting inside, you can get seated faster.. . The croissant and muffin were excellent.  Parisian bakery.  Coffee was awesome.  Service was so nice about getting a to-go cup for a coffee refill.  Highly recommend.. . Want to come back here for a longer and proper breakfast next time!
The food was good but Vegas overpriced. That is to be expected, I suppose. Overall we enjoyed the quick dinner we had before the show we were going to see. The service was excellent!
Came here on Sunday October 26 around 12:30pm for brunch and as a Las Vegas local I was actually impressed!. . Great table service.  Tasty Food.  Great atmosphere.  Great views (from the patio).. . The hostess had an attitude (if I was a manager and saw this I'd fire her) we were told the wait for outdoor patio seating was about 30-45 minutes and that we could not take the buzzer very far.  We ended up waiting about 15 minutes and played some of the machines, why they don't have more seating for guests to wait is beyond me.. . We were seated one row back from the edge of where the patio meets the strip, I asked if  we could sit at a table that was clearly open along the railing and the hostess moved us over there right away.. . Our sever, Emily, was PHENOMENAL.  One of the best servers I've encountered in Vegas.  She recommended a great seafood appetizer (mussels), a tasty brunch item (corned beef hash) and delicious mimosas.  All of the food was tasty!  My only con is that it did seem to take a bit longer than normal to finally receive out entrees, but the flavor made up for it!. . The entire time we had a front row view to the Bellagio water fountain show just across the strip.  It was also a prime spot to people watch, which in Vegas it gets VERY interesting.  BE WARNED that on the patio it does get a bit warm sitting in the sun, even in October.  They do have umbrellas to provide shade, but as the sun moves you begin to have no control over the shade as there is really no room to move the umbrellas.. . All in all my girlfriend and I had a great experience and we will be going back again in the future!
Excellent food and great service. We were seated inside promptly. If you want to sit outside, I recommend reservations.. . We'll be back.
The lobster tail in the seafood platter was excellent, as was the guacamole ceviche. The steak came out well done even though I ordered medium rare, but the waiter resolved it pretty quickly. The food was worth the wait.
One of the best views in Vegas!  Patio seating across from the Bellagio fountains.  Classic french with a flair for the moderately expensive.  Breakfast is best, lunch is luscious, and dinner, well dinner is downright dreamy.   Try anything, I just think you cant go wrong.  I have had the soups, sandwiches, breakfast eggs benedict with Smoked Salmon, the salads,the steaks, the drinks.  They have it all.  5 star stuff. Bring wallet.
Yummers! My gfs took me here for my bday a few years ago and I have to say I had a great time. . . I was a little skeptical at first because I had been here, and passed by this place many, many, many times and never really saw anything too exciting about it. In fact I thought it was a chain so I was pretty turned off with the whole idea of going here.. . However, it was my bff's fave place ever, so who am I to argue ... :) . . I was really shocked that its very romantic, dim, dark, but fancy in here. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. They definitely make a great and well priced french style steak here with the extremely thin cuts and the perfectly almost grate-like fried onion pieces on top. . . The location is fantastic and overall I recommend it for a big group (as we had) or a nice romantic tuck away kind of dinner especially if you're craving steak but don't want to spend CUT prices.
Food was sub par. I ended up ordering a salad after trying my wife's steak. Our server seemed to want to get rid of us from the get go. After we ate and had desert she was no where to be found. Sub. Par.
Dined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the "poser" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. . . I discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we "were only hurting the servers" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:. . - Mediocre food. - Bad service. - Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.. . With so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.
The service is terrific here.. Food-. Chicken moose pate was good.. Steak, asked for medium and got well done. Texture and flavor was not all that.. Scallops, horrific! Texture and taste, worst ever.. Red apple martini, very delicious.. For over $80, it's hurts!
