I don't know how to say this gently, but I would have rather stayed at a Holiday Inn Express than my four nights at Paris. First, as we walked into the hotel to start four days of business travel, we were met by hawkers trying to get us to look at condos in return for show tickets. One of them actually took my wife by the arm and tried to lead her over to their kiosk. After dodging them, we walked a little further, and another shopkeeper stopped my wife and tried to convince her to buy eye cream. We finally got in line at registration and were happy to find only six parties in line ahead of us. After about fifteen minutes, the line had not moved. When it finally came time to register, we found out why the line moved so slowly, as we were upsold everything from Wi-Fi to spa packages. Speaking of Wi-Fi, it's $15 a day PER DEVICE, which is ridiculous considering that Vegas is a destination for many conventions...the reason for our stay. Our room was adequate..think HamptonInn with a granite shower. Since we had been traveling for many hours and were still on Eastern time, and had to rise early for a morning meeting, we retired to bed around 9PM. At 11PM, our pictures and mirrors began shaking as a DJ at a club at the base of the Eiffel Tower about 100 yards from our room began playing Techno Dance music with subwoofers that must have been the size of a Dodge Caravan. Let me be clear, the Paris Hotel was playing loud music right outside their guests' rooms from 11PM-4AM. When we asked about this, we were told that we could request earplugs. One of the people who checked in with my company was told they could have a room with a view, but it would be loud, or, they could overlook the parking deck. I would like to have been in the business meeting where that decision was made. "What can we do about the fact that the back of our hotel has a terrible view?" "How about we play loud music all night outside the rooms with a nice view just to even things out?" "Brilliant, Roberts! Let's implement that right away!" Seriously, though, if you are given a choice, stay away from the Paris. If you aren't given a choice, at least pick a room with a lousy view. At least you'll sleep at night.
Ooh la la!  Want to stay in a hotel that represents France without having to fly all that way to the actual country?   Well mon ami, you are in luck, the lucky city of Las Vegas has been home to the Paris Hotel and Casino for quite some time now.  If you are a Total Rewards member or Triple A member, I recommend staying at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas and using your discounts if applicable.  The WiFi is complimentary with your resort fee for hotel guests only.  The hotel bathroom is spacious, with great lighting especially for those who need to apply make-up.  The room service menu has delicious options that are French inspired, especially the crepes.  The staff are helpful and kind, the service here is "se magnifique!"  So grab your beret and cest la vie in Paris Las Vegas!
This review is from the perspective of a visitor, who did not stay at this hotel, but from a wide-eyed walk-in guy in for a look. I have been to Paris France, arguably the most famous and interesting City in the world. This hotel is a poor travesty of that great City.. . The good news: I enjoyed a glass of wine from the wine-to-go window. The barista recommended an Aussie wine, which was fine, but a surprise, in that he and I were both in a themed hotel, Paris. Wouldn't he at least feature French Burgoyne or Bordeaux wines?. . Why the low review, which is uncharacteristic of me? I give every establishment I visit at least three chances to provide me with a bad opinion of it. This was the least friendly of the Las Vegas Strip hotels I visited on a two day walkabout. . . I found that many of the features of the hotel had loyalty club entrances, but if you wanted to be a normal customer, you had to hunt for that back door entrance.. . Many of the employees I engaged need to work on their people skills. The vibe was negative with several of them. It seemed to me that employee moral was low and no one was really in to it. Sad, as I find hoteliers have to be enthusiastic for their business to thrive.. . A place of business gets but one chance to make a good first impression. Not a big deal for me, but mentionable in that the poor attitude of this place is tangible.
This hotel has declined over the past years. We had a late check in and did not get the room we reserved. Understandably since we were late, however they gave us the worse room in the building. It was small and dark with absolutely no view at all. We were told by the front desk that we could have a room change in the morning, we never heard from those at the front desk as promised. Nonetheless we suffered through another night of noise and constant banging from who knows what. The walls are paper thin so good luck getting any rest. The furniture can use a makeover as well, the writing desk was burnt from possibly an iron?? I will not be staying here again regardless of deal they are having.  The reason I gave it 2 stars was the ease of checking in and the staff was very kind.
Stayed here for my 50th birthday this past summer, loved it! We had no issues with an early check in, but we stayed Sunday through Wednesday, so not sure how it is on a Friday or Saturday. The interior is pretty cool, imo. The staff was friendly, the rooms were nice, the pool was fun, the restaurants were all great, especially the breakfast buffet. The first night we ate at the burger joint and we each had a shake that has alcohol in it, fabulous, although I will say Vegas is not exactly as cheap as it once was, the bill for 2 burgers, 2 fries and the 2 shakes was just over a Grant$$. Hotels is in a good location and convenient to lot of things to do on the Strip. I enjoyed this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.
Just stayed overnight at the Paris for the first time this past Saturday.  I have visited the casino in the past, so I already knew it's basic layout.  This was my first time staying in one of their rooms. I got a room with two queen beds and was pleased with the room size and cleanliness. The bathroom really impressed me with it's size and decor. I loved the separate tub and shower. The vanity had ample counter space for the standard array of ladies toiletries. I just wish hotels would equip their bathrooms with ventilation fans to help clear out the humidity and, um, other bathroom odors.. . The TV is mounted to the wall, but it's way off center to accomodate the large armoire on the same wall. The armoire has two closet doors and three drawers to place clothing in. There is also a mini fridge in one of the cabinets in the armoire. I then realized the bathroom was so spacious because there was no built in closet, the armoire is your closet. It actually works because the armoire is French, and being the Paris hotel, it makes sense decor wise.. . The beds were comfortable and the headboard was padded faux leather. It was nice because I often sit up in bed with my head resting against the headboard. The decorative pillows on the bed were too much though. Two very large brown velour covered pillows and one bolster pillow. So actually there were only two small pillows that had pillowcases on them to lay your head and sleep on. I wouldn't sleep on the velour ones as I doubt those get changed like the sheets do.. . There is wi-fi included for two devices with the "resort package" which I think means the "resort fee," and you can have more with an additonal fee. The TV channel selection was limited and kind of in an odd sequence. They have groups of six elevators each to service the different sections of floors, and they were quite speedy. . . The employees I encountered from valet, bell service, and front desk were all well-mannered and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.
I love Paris, but don't love the Vegas version of the hotel.  Sure it has the Eiffel Tower, the Montgolfier Balloon, and the Arc de Triomphe.  Sure it has one of my favorite restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi, and a terrific buffet.  Sure, if your room faces the Blvd then you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  But the hotel and casino is not good for one reason only -- SMOKERS.. . You have to walk by the bar to go to/fro your room or buffet, and be hit square in the nose with smoke.  Why don't they build another place for SMOKERS and enclose it in glass so they can kill themselves?  Instead, it's unavoidable madness.. . If you are a SMOKER, then it's great.  Highly recommended.
I've only stayed at a couple places in Vegas, Planet Hollywood and Paris, but this was my third and last visit to Paris.  . . Like others, I concur that the rooms are getting pretty worn, and need an update.  Prifes are sky hifg, bit they are pretty much everywhere else too, so its not unusual.. . Will review them separately, but Mon Ami Gabi is an awesome place for breakfast, amd Gordon Ramsay Steak had excellent food and service, but was loud and $255, for 2 people (total of 3 cocktails, 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 sauce, 2 sides and 2 desserts.  Obscene.). . The upgraded Red rooms are a joke, they are the exact same rooms as the others, with a red headboard and bedspread, for a premium price.  Don't waste your money.. . The worst part of the hotel is the Chateau Nightclub, which is an open air nightclub under the Eiffel tower.  If you have the misfortune of being able to see the tower, you are SCREWED.   The club plays DEAFENINGLY LOUD hiphop til 4 AM and the bass can not be drowned out with earplugs.  . . It is a terrible location for a club, even people at Bally's have to suffer.  It needs to be indoors and in a soundproof room, or else the hotel needs triple paned soundproof glass on all their windows.  You will get no sleep!  I'm writing this at 1:33AM, have barely slept all weekend, and know better than to even try til it's almost light outside.  . . Any hotel that would torture its paying guests like this won't get another penny of my money until its changed.  If a car were going down the street with bass thumping like this, you would get a ticket every time a cop saw you.  This is noise pollution at its very worst.  Making people hear what they don't want to hear!  Grrr angry!
This is a review for the casino only!. . I did not stay in the Paris hotel. I am considering it if I ever go back though after my experience at the Venetian! I only spent about 5 hours at Paris on a Saturday night and was sad I couldn't stay longer. . . The entire vibe inside the casino here is fun! There was a dj playing great music just off the main casino area near the center bar. I actually wanted to run out there and dance (if I had more time). . . The cocktail waitresses are ALL over you getting you anything you need. They even made sure to have water on them and would offer it right up. I nearly died of thirst at Venetian! . . The casino isn't nearly as large as others on the strip but it has everything you need. I have to admit I was a little confused about the half naked girls dancing over what appeared to be the blackjack or poker tables? . . Lots of cute cafes and shops to stop and spend time in. I wish I spent an entire day in here. Next time.
This is a nice property, and they did a good job of importing some elements of the fair city, albeit Vegas style. The crepes at "La Creperie"are very good, and quite large. I recommend the "Eiffle Tower" tour - (hint free to public safety) Pretty amazing view of Strip & the Bellagio water show in particular. ($14 for adults).
I love the themed casino and hotels.  The architecture is awesome like a mini version of Paris.  Coming to Vegas, you have to stop at Paris.   The rooms maybe a little worn out and some of the layouts are odd.   It's decent, price is good, considering you right on the strip. The excitement for Paris lies on the first floor.
For years I'd been wanting to stay at Paris, so when I was in Vegas October 3rd - 5th for a friends wedding I knew I had to stay there and check it off.. . There were many things I liked about the hotel, such as the number of great food options that are inside of it (Mon Ami Gabi is outstanding as well as the creperie), but unfortunately a lot disappointed me.. . When I made my reservation weeks in advance I booked a King bed. Upon arrival after a very long drive from Los Angeles, I was informed that I'd be getting 2 Queen beds instead (completely unnecessary) and that my booking merely expressed a preference with no guarantee. Bit of a bummer. Thankfully I was still given a non-smoking room on the 18th floor. . . When getting to my room, I noticed that it had been a while since the doors had been cleaned as there were dirty marks around the handle and card slot. Then inside the room itself on the carpet I saw that the TV stand/armoire that previously was in there was replaced with another - but there were still strange marks and stains around it. Where you'd think the TV would be in the armoire is actually where the fridge is as the TV was on the side to the right making its location on the wall only visible to one of the beds. . . When I went into the bathroom I saw that whoever was in there previously cleaning missed a rather large tuft of hair on the floor, and I know it definitely wasn't mine as I have fine, blonde hair and this was thick and dark. Kind of grossed me out as I began to doubt what else hadn't been cleaned. . . There was a paper on the desk in the room that is supposed to have on there who the cleaning person was, but no name was written and I could tell it had been there for a while since whoever was previously staying in the room wrote some numbers on the back of it. That paper was never touched the entirety of my stay as Saturday after the cleaning crew came in I checked it again and, sure enough, the numbers were found on the back of it. . . When I took my shower Saturday morning I deliberately left some hair on the shower wall to test the cleaning crew, but upon coming back from walking the Strip all afternoon it was still there and they left the shower door open. The trash was also untouched. . . The room was really cold, and the blankets/comforters on the bed itself wasn't really sufficient so I found myself having to up the temperature a few times. . . One of the people next to us got room service Sunday morning at a rather early time, so that woke me up as the walls were a little thin and whoever delivered the room service itself knocked loudly on their door. . . When making a final check in the room to make sure my boyfriend and I didn't miss anything when packing we discovered that there was a random cashew on the floor under the extra bed, and on the one we slept on the box spring covering looked dirty with black smudges on it. . . I had been looking forward to using the tub in the room, as I don't have a tub back at home, but it was really shallow (pictures made it look deeper) and even though I'm only 5'4" I knew there was no way I'd fit comfortably - plus I doubted how clean it was after everything else.. . The casino itself is so smoky, so if you have asthma or are sensitive to cigarette smoke like I am I suggest walking fast through those areas because it's quite gross. . . Beware using the ATM on the casino floor as well. It'll give you a prompt that there's the fee of $5.99 or whatever (to be expected), however on my bank statement I saw an ADDITIONAL charge of $2.50 which I wasn't informed of and thought that was pretty shitty. . . If you drive there and park your car in valet, there is NO option to call earlier the day you're leaving to say something like "please have my car (number on valet ticket) ready at 10:00." You just have to get down there and wait, which can take forever. I waited about 30 minutes for my car. Same goes for needing a cab. You have to wait in a long line outside off to the left instead. . . I did like how I could check in/check out electronically and skipping the potential lines, so that was nice at least. . . Would I stay there again? Maybe. The location is convenient in the middle of the Strip and across from the Bellagio fountain. I'm just not particularly keen on spending close to $600 on a room for 2 nights that wasn't properly cleaned.
The hotel rooms are ok but they are not 350 dollar a night rooms. Had to call twice to get the television fixed and when he was done it still didn't work so gave up. Wasn't that big of a deal but stuff should work.  Nice showers. Casino was small for that size hotel. I go to Vegas a lot and try different hotels and I wont stay here again.
Beware of the new $25 "guest fee" they tack on now on top of the $11 booking fee. Told it was a new corporate policy they started last summer for all the Las Vegas hotels in the Harrahs chain. The hotel and rooms are very nice but i can't stand the feeling of being ripped off by yet another corporate scheme to make money.
This was my very first trip to Vegas.  I was so excited.  Alas, that excitement was short lived.  My first trip to Vegas was RUINED when I came back in my room after housekeeping had cleaned it and realized I was ROBBED!!  Yes, MY STUFF WAS STOLEN! Now, you would think a hotel that is this prestigious would be quick to come to the aid of one of their patrons but no.  I filed a report with their security office, it was turned over to their Risk Management Company and we found out today our claim was DENIED.  They said they asked the hotel staff if they stole the stuff...Do you really think your staff is going to say "Yes?"  Now, they're saying the burden of proof is on us.  Uh, apparently they don't understand how burden of proof actually works.  I proved that my stuff was stolen when I filled out the report - unless you have cameras showing me packing my backpack out of the hotel, I've proved my case.  You pay a TON of money for a room thinking that you and your stuff is secure but apparently this hotel doesn't care about you, your stuff or your security.  When we asked for the security footage, we were told they don't have security cameras in the hallways.  REALLY?!?  You think that it is safe to NOT have security cameras in the HALLWAY. Worst customer service experience ever!  Stay here if you want their staff to rob you blind and not give a crap about you.  #terriblecustomerservice @parisvegas #dontstayhere. . Oh look!  Another guest robbed: http://www.vegas.com/resorts/paris/#reviews. . October 14, 2014. On May of this year I was robbed the night before my husband and I checked out of the Paris Hotel and Casino. My husband and I stayed at the Paris as part of a company event. I had put my carry on away in the armoir of our room and in it i had placed my oversized purse. I had transfered a few items from my purse into a smaller purse so my license and credit card were not taken, but the carry on, oversized leather purse and other miscellaneous items were taken. We contacted the hotel security that evening and had a pending report with them. Within a few weeks a was in touch with the hotels' insurance adjuster. I had to stay in touch with this person several times after that to see what had come of my claim.3 months after the theft i was told The Paris Hotel & Casino was not at fault of any wrong doing and my claim was denied. This was after they "received" a report from housekeeping saying that the housekeeping staff knew nothing about this theft. I tried calling the hotel several times to talk to a manager to see what else they could do for me and nothing. I got the run-around and I also got a hotel manager who said he couldn't help and he was too busy to take care of this. I lost $600 that day. For some, it may not be much money, but for me it was money i wasn't expecting to spend on a new carry on for the next mornings' flight and replacing a $300 purse. Hotel says they have no cameras in their hotel hallways, so be careful with the cleaning staff.
I love how this casino makes you think it's day time 24/7. During a night of partying, you will never know what time it really is unless you actually look at your watch. The waitresses that ask to see if you want any drinks are usually always attractive here. The feel is very unique. I also liked their pool area. They keep their water clean and it doesn't burn your eyes when you go for a swim. How did they do it? I have no idea! But that really did impress me! This is one of those places that you just gotta stop by and test your luck during a night of walking the strip and getting intoxicated. It's right there in the middle of the strip, so you'll always find something to do.
Ugh. The beds at Paris were the only thing worth talking about here. The beds are super comfortable and the room itself is nice. The casino itself is oddly laid out and the restaurants were nothing to speak of. The casino seems old and outdated in an unpleasant way. We spent far more time out of the hotel than in it. The pool area was ok - I liked the lay out for the most part and it was never super crowded. Though they did play music hideously loudly all weekend - that was a turn-off. We wanted to relax at the pool - not get blasted by Pit Bull tunes. I wouldn't stay here again by choice.
2 of our rooms were robbed while we were sleeping. It is pretty scary knowing that while we were sleeping someone came into our room and stole money out of 2 of the purses and the third one they took my nieces whole wallet. . We had 4 rooms there the week of October 15, the hotel security was called. They are a joke. We went to the police station and made a report. . The managers at the front desk are the worst and did nothing to help us. The assistant manager had the nerve to say that maybe one of our family members stole from us! SERIOUSLY!!!
Ah Paris!  Maybe not quite the sameas heading over to France, but the Paris hotel of Vegas is a fun, romantic, sexy place. Nothing like looking at smoking hot girls dance above your blackjack table! The rooms at Paris really are not that bad. The suites are interesting. The one I had , had two bathrooms. One with a shower only in it and the other near the living room area of this small suite had a hot tub in it. Don't see that everyday or at any other casino i have stayed at in Vegas with that type of setup.. The dealers and employees at this hotel are very friendly and the restaurants were excellent. The gambling area at Paris are not very large and can get crowded but that smaller area is really visited frequently by the beautiful cocktail servers. I literally never waited once for a drink. This is a fun place and is a great place to take your significant other!
Right on the strip and had the best view ever!! We watched the Bellagio Fountains every night. Lobby is beautiful. Restaurants are delicious. Staff is very friendly. Room is nice (stayed at the Red Room Luxury). There's a fridge in the room but no microwave, which was a bummer. But the view made up for it. VERY PLEASED!
We didn't stay at Paris but we gambled there quite a bit while we were in Vegas. The Casino is fantastic!  The waitresses were super friendly and attentive! Can't wait to go back there again next time we're in town!
The only reason they are getting 2 stars is the great restaurants. My bed was hard as a rock, no cushiness, you could actually feel the springs beneath you. The pillows were terrible as well. I woke up this morning at 2am with the worst pain in my neck and couldn't get back to sleep- this NEVER happens to me. Motel 8 has better beds. The tv is not in the armoire, it's way on the left side of the room so it cannot be viewed by both people laying on the bed. Terrible design! Way overpriced for what you get. I won't be back if I can avoid it.
