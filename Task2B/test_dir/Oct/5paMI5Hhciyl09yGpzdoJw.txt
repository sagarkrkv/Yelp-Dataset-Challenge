I really enjoyed our stay. The suite was lovely. They messed up on our breakfast twice, but it was included with our stay, so I can't really complain.
Nice rooms, but absolutely zero amenities. No in room coffee (!), and no place to buy any before 7am. No mini fridge without extra fee. No gym access without extra fee. I'm surprised they don't charge extra for toilet paper. Although I had a reservation for a king room, when none were available they "upgraded" me to a queen. A luxury experience means getting the little things right.
I loved this hotel! I wish we had stayed more than one night. It's beautiful everywhere you go and the price was really good. You get an awesome room for your money. We had a great view of the mountains which I though was peaceful considering the lights and craziness of the strip. I wanted to take everything in the room home with me! Seriously I WANT the couch! The staff was great and there was so much exploring to do. You can easily get to the Venetian Shops and so many other places. I would stay here again!
The palazzo is my favorite hotel/casino in Vegas.  Rooms are comfortable and have a art-deco type of vibe to it, the service is generally on point, and the casino is usually not insanely crowded.  . . The only complaint I would ever have is that they don't have their own poker room.  And as someone who spends most of their gambling time at the poker tables - its a pain in the ass and a long walk to the venetian side.
This is one of the top 5 hotel/casinos, facility-wise, in Vegas (IMHO). The building is beautifully appointed and well tended to. That said, the service levels have been suspect on many of my adventures here, however, that was not the case on my most recent trip. I had great encounters with the front desk personnel and my favorite new bartender on the strip (pro tip- go see Wendy. She'll get you very pleasantly drunk).. . WHEN YOU GO- all the rooms are suites but not all suites are created equal. For a mild upgrade fee ($40 a day) I went from their standard 550-ish sq foot rooms to an 1,100 sq footer with amazing pool views and a bathroom bigger than most strip rooms. If you'll be hanging at the pool, and I recommend you do, be aware that in the fall months the sun shifts drastically and quickly. Your killer spot that you staked out at 10:30am could easily be in the dark by 1pm. Ask the friendly pool staff where the spotz are. And don't forget to tip for that intel!
Disgusting job on cleaning the rooms. Dried pee stains on both of the rooms that were assigned to us. Managers did not care enough to speak to us personally about the situation.
