It's actually been over a year since my last visit to Komex, so I apologize for the lack of detail in the review. However, my last update doesn't reflect how my current opinion, so I needed to correct my rating. Suffice to say, it was more than a little disappointing.. . I went with a friend over an extended lunch. It was his first time, and he was pretty impressed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way. Looking back on my at-the-time basic photos, I had some bulgogi fries and a chimichanga, which most likely would have been pork given my tendencies. There weren't any salt or cooking issues, but the levels and layers of flavor just didn't appeal to me very much that day.. . I did greatly appreciate the sweet, fresh orange provided for dessert and the complimentary chips and salsa presented as an appetizer, but nothing has motivated me to make the trip from Henderson. I'd recommend sticking to more flavorful Mexican tacos or waiting to try the Korean-Mexican fusion concept elsewhere.
This place was right next door to the school we had a basketball tournament at so I though I should just check it out. It was an interesting concept having Korean infused Mexican food. I decided to play it safe and got the kimchee fried rice. It was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried my friends cheesesteak and that was pretty bomb. I'd be open to coming back to eat here again and probably be a little bit more adventurous. . . The key negative here is the slow service and the fact that they take forever to bring your bill and pick up your check. Was about to give it a three but I guess I'm just in a good mood right now.
This place is awesome!!! I've been here at least 10 times and they never disappoint.  The bulgogi fries and tacos are excellent.  They deserve 100 stars and they're prices are freaking great!!!!. . This is where the locals go!!!!!!!  Even saw a bunch of cops eating here, so you know it's good.
Was very satisfied with the Beef Burrito a very awesome place to go and fulfill your mexican food craving ...will be coming back for more
Must try if your into fusion food. The chicken fries was awesome. Got the half and it was awesome. Great food for the bucks. The bulgogi sliders were awesome too.. This place has great people that will take care of you.
Yummy!! I got the kimchee fried rice and the bulgogi flautas. Both were very good. I'd def come again. Wish they had a location on the south side of town.
Awesome Mexican/Korean fusion food. Fast efficient service. I liked the shrimp, fish, tofu, and calamari tacos.
One of my favorite joints in Vegas. This is our go to place when we're super hungry, because we can get amazing food for the price. Not once have we ever been disappointed. My favorite is the bulgogi fried rice and calamari tacos. They have a house salsa that is spot on with the Korean/Mexican fusion. I dump it on everything!
Delightful. Very interesting large & diverse menu that pleased my whole family, from the finicky 7 year old (he gives KoMex "10 stars! "), to the grumpy teenager ("ugh") to the very selective wifey, who liked how clean it is despite being not new, she liked that the entire menu could be made vegetarian (tofu or veggies), she liked the hustle & competence of our waiter/host, and she liked how everybody really liked their food.. . I loved all of the above, plus that I could feed my whole family of six for about $40, or about $6.50 each.. . They also had half orders of everything, perfect for my 7 & 10 year old.. . Without asking our host noticed that we'd not finished our plates and he brought over takeout clamshells & bags. On the ball! . . Bonus Trivia: their "tap water" is in fact bottled water. The "tap water" they serve at your table in a large clear carafe is bottled. The water they use to rinse & cook the rice is bottled. The water they use to cook everything is bottled, at the insistence of the owner. My wife noticed that this made everything taste "fresh".. . I liked that everything we ordered was more Mex, with a hint of Korean, yet I'm sure if you wanted a spicier Korean fare they would oblige, in fact Kimchee is on the menu. For example, my son's fusion nachos looked like awesome macho nachos, but the meat was marinated in Korean spices.. . We will be back!
I went here for the first time with my colleagues and the food was great. The server was nice and it was a comfy environment. I had the bulgogi nachos and it was mmm, mmm good. Couldn't eat it all though since the portion was pretty big. Will definitely go again soon.
Why are you here reading these reviews? Just go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazing food, fantastic service.
