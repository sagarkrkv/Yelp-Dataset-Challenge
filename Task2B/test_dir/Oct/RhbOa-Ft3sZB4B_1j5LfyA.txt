EXCELLENT Service! Delicious Food. Unbeatable prices. . . Mr. Mama's is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. There is no going wrong here.
I'm not a breakfast connoisseur so I have to say that by itself the food tastes like most breakfast places. A couple things stood out like their biscuits and gravy and the phirry cheese steak omelet (no that's not a typo that's how my Asian aunt ordered it and raves about it...herro). But what really stood out was the service, they're attentive, polite and some of the staff actually took the time out to have a couple funny conversations with and that somehow made the breakfast that much better. Rearry rearry better.
Breakfast is my favorite meal.  Everytime I go I try something different,  still keep going.  They have flavored coffee creamer!! I recommend the pancakes super fluffy and buttery.  Yum
My only complaint is that there is often a wait so it prevents me from making it a regular lunch spot. My first visit was with my brother, we had heard about the hashbrowns so they were a must despite ordering a gyro ($7.75) and patty melt ($8.75). They were great and we enjoyed our sandwiches. Service was friendly and they seemed really happy to have us.. . I've since returned twice for breakfast with my family. I had the pancakes both times. I really like that I can get a short stack with bacon and it doesn't cost a fortune. Bacon is thick and rich with bacon flavor. The pancakes are large, thick and fluffy. One of these times, I'll explore more of the menu. My family has always been pleased with their selections too.
We tried this place based on their high Yelp rating with so many reviews. The rating and many reviews were accurate! This is a terrific breakfast and lunch spot! The service was exactly at the level we  wanted, and the food was terrific!
Stop what you are doing right now. Leave the casinos and come eat at this place. The staff is friendly and top notch. The food came out fast and man oh man is it tasty! The biscuits melt in your mouth and the omelettes are fluffy and just the BEST. Do yourself a favor - EAT HERE!
Outstanding. O U T standing!. We missed it the first time by, but turned around and found it the second time.. Too small for the crowd but the atmosphere was still comfortable.  The food was great and service was prompt.  We had biscuits and gravy and they were very unique! Unlike anything else but still delicious.. The owner was there walking around and talking to everyone while we were there.  He has a huge personality and was a delight to interact with.
Love this place! They food is fresh and delicious!! Service was great too! If you like clam chowder, try it here...it's made fresh and you can definitely tell!!
Flew the red-eye into Vegas and came here for breakfast.  On Saturdays, they open at 0700, and so I had to wait until they opened.  Was one of the first in the door.  Small place, probably only room for about 50.  Ordered the cali omelet with potatoes (should have ordered hash browns as the potatoes were just okay).  The omelet was fresh, tasty.  Came with toast.  Had coffee.  With a tip it was $15, so a fair price.  The others in the restaurants seemed to be pleased with their meals, and the service was very friendly (with lots of waitstaff).  I'd go here again for sure, but if the previous reviews about lines is true, not sure it would be worth waiting for.
Went here for breakfast & it is soooooo yummy! But you want to get there before about 8:30 cuz ppl start lining up about that time. ;)
Back again...like every time we come to Vegas. FOUR egg omelette. Yummy!  And shareable.
Breakfast burrito is my favorite :-) Always look forward to having lunch there.Great service and phenomenal food!
Small spot with a short but strong menu. Sometimes a large breakfast menu can be overwhelming, but the choices at Mr. Mamas are simple and they allow substitutions. I ordered the Spanish Omelette with Cheddar Jack in place of the Parmesan and it was delicious. Portions are large but manageable, and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered both coffee and orange juice (I do this often) and the coffee was slightly bitter for my taste, but all can be forgiven because they offer CoffeeMate along side creamer!  The staff are attentive and the manager (owner?), came and personally checked on how my meal was. I will definitely be returning!
Great food and excellent service! I love their chicken fried steak, the best I've had!
We were looking for a good breakfast burrito,  and came across Mr. Mamas on Yelp.  The restaurant was easy to find, clean, and friendly.  The customer service was great and our food arrived really quick and hot.. . Unfortunately I didn't care for my breakfast burrito as it was like a scrambled egg skillet wrapped in a tortilla.  My husband got the Cali omlett that had lots of cheese and fresh avocado so (yum) but was a bit bland for our tastes.   We tried the biscuits and gravy based on other's reviews of its uniqueness.  They were ok, but had a meat that looked and tasted like crumbled spam - we were not fans.. . I want to be fair and remind readers we only tried 3 -menu items and the food was very fresh... just not the style and seasonings I personally prefer my food to be prepared.
Stopped there thanks to Yelp. Tried the cali along with the biscuits and gravy. Very delicious and very fast, courteous service. Even with us walking in there at almost closing time. Thank you for an excelent meal!
Great service! Good food! Can't wait to come back to try something else... Too many good stuff to choose from.
Best omelet I've ever had & the home fries are the best thing we ate! Great atmosphere & the owner came around to ensure everything was good! We will be coming back (I wanna try the pancakes that kept going out to other tables that looked AMAZING!)
Solid 4.5 stars.. . Was craving country fried steak and eggs and this place definitely satisfied my craving... . The batter on the steak was crispy, the sausage gravy was so delicious, flavorful and chunky. We didn't care too much for the cinnamon roll.  We also ordered an omelet and it was pretty good too. The main were large and generous portions for sure.. . Service was excellent.. . I'd definitely come back here again!
Great comfort food place!. Super crazy on the weekends, but worth the wait!
One of the best omelettes I've ever head. No kidding. . . Came here near closing time and didn't have to wait. Clean. Decent seating area. Good sized menu. Reasonable prices. . . Very friendly main host who came and chatted with us and welcomed us.. . Food came out quick. Excellent omelette with the cheese, spinach and chicken all blending in nicely. Throughly enjoyed the fresh avocado on top. Fresh flavorful crunchy hash brown. Great home fries but I liked the hash brown better. Yummy rye bread with butter. Good hot fresh coffee. Excellent waitress who kept the coffee flowing and was very pleasant. . . Love places like these with excellent food, great prices and a warm welcoming atmosphere. . . 5 stars!
Probably the best breakfast I ever had. Go here and you will NOT be disappointed. I had the chicken fried stake and eggs and it was amazing.  We had a party of 7 and everyone left full and happy. The hostess and waitresses were awsome, I tip my hat to the owner of this fine establishment.
This is my second time here.  I keep missing out on the cinnamon rolls but that's what I get for sleeping in.  I've tried both lunch and breakfast now and both ate delicious.  Breakfast is where it's at.
I admit, I am a Mr. Mama's boy... This was recommended by a friend for breakfast/brunch. . . I ordered Mama's French toast and was thoroughly impressed. The French toast was delicious, however, the eggs and bacon was heaven. I can imagine what their omelettes taste like.. . My friend raved about their cheeseburgers and cinnamon rolls ended up ordering a breakfast sandwich. He was equally impressed. . . If you are looking for a good breakfast or brunch spot and don't want to deal with the long lines at some of the other places definitely stop by Mr. mamas!
Great, great food. Priced very fair. Staff was great and on point. Kids loved the pancakes and French toast. I loved the chicken fried steak. Our new favorite "go to" spot. A well earned 5 star. . . Just a heads up.. It has become, deservingly so, a very popular place, so you may want to call in advance to check wait times on weekends. . . We had to wait 20 min but it was absolutely worth it. . . Highly recommended.
You feel the family ambiance as soon as you walk in. The server's are very attentive and greet you with their name. The food is great! My party of 4 had the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, Mamas Breakfast Burrito, Denver Omelet and French Toast. The food was delicious! The restaurant is small however it's worth the wait.
The BEST chicken fried steak I've ever had. The prices were good and the staff was great! If you're looking for a good breakfast off the strip, check this place out :)
Best breakfast in vegas. Worth the drive, Worth the expense.. . Headed here on our way out of vegas. We knew we were headed for mass traffic so we filled our stomachs.. . Chicken fried steak. One of my favorite breakfast meals and this place makes it perfect. The gravy was rich and the chicken fried steak was tasty. . . I think this is a must have in vegas.
Flight landed in Vegas at 8:00 a.m. and we were hungry.  This is a weird, little strip mall joint but the food was good and the service was fast and the waitress was really nice.
I absolutely adore omletes. It is my go-to breakfast or brunch food.  I make them at home because I enjoy them that much. . . With that said,  you can trust when I say these are great omletes.  Specifically the California Omlete. The eggs where fluffy and had a nice spring to them. Excellently prepared.  Topped with homemade salsa and sour cream,  the flavors blended with the avalcado  so well that I felt bad adding hot sauce to bring up the heat level.  It still tasted great...even with the new flavor. . . Fairly large dining room.  Calming blue decor makes you forget the scorching sun outdoors.  The owner was on site checking on customers and their enjoyment.  I like those brief encounters.   He didn't stick around to micro-manage that shows he trusts that his staff is well trained and can operate without him.  I overheard him singing their praise to another customer!  Fantastic approach to management/ownership.. . Stop in here while in the Vegas area!  This is what YELP is for,  to share great locations that are off the beaten path.  VISIT!!
Amazing food, great prices, and exceptional service. Owner Nick sat us, brought us coffee, and took our check. Very friendly and hands on. This place is a gem just off the strip
Landed in Vegas and went in search of breakfast. Saw the reviews for this and decided to give it a try. Yummy goodness! At our table we had chicken fried steak, Denver omelet, biscuits and gravy, and pancakes. We all sampled bites of the dishes we chose and agreed we made a great choice to come here. The owner even came to our table to greet us and make sure we were happy with our food. We would definitely go back and based on the constant flow of customers while we were there it is a local favorite as well.
Awesome biscuits and gravy!  Fast friendly service.  Highly recommend if you want to support a local business and get away from the strip.
Great people, delicious food and wonderful service! Coffee tasted delicious too!. . Massive portions - breakfast all day!!! Place to be with you Ohana!
Excellent breakfast! The owner Nick was fantastic - he makes you feel right at home. Service was very efficient. It was worth the wait.
Nick the owner was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Food was great and service was top notch! Highly recommend
I stopped off here on a sunday morning to grab some breakfast to go for my group of friends I was with. I grab a few of their breakfast burritos, their hashbrowns and their pancakes. The staff there were really nice and helpful. They set me up with some coffee while I waited for my food. I thought the salsa is what made the burrito! Also they have turkey bacon option for their burritos. I thought it was the right consistency of eggs with onions and peppers with cheese and meat of choice. I would definitely like to try this place again and have a sit down breakfast here. Definitely check it out.
This is a must try breakfast  place . Service is great & foods are delicious . I ordered the Cali omelette since so many good reviews about it .
YUCK!!!! I feel sick just writing this review. Yelpers you have let me down. The food was downright rotten (literally,) my Cali Omelette smelled and tasted rotten. I don't know if the egg or cheese were old or artificial. The home potatoes lacked seasoning and were extremely bland. I only ate a couple of bites and sent it back. I refused to reorder anything else, I just didn't trust this place after that. My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and the Cinnamon Roll and he enjoyed them. I had a couple of bites of the Cinnamon Roll and it reminded me of the fake Pillsbury Dough rolls. Not a Fan!!! :( If I need a Breakfast fix, I will go elsewhere.
The plaza that this breakfast joint is located in consists of a bunch of car stores, lol. I was confused and thought we might've turned into the wrong plaza, but nope! Upon arrival, the door was opened for us by a friendly gentleman who also seated us. Menus are already on the table. Everyone here is extremely nice and attentive. We opted to order the Biscuits and Gravy with Hashbrowns, French toast (2), a Cinnamon Roll, and a side of Sausage Patties.. . Biscuits and Gravy: One of the best I've had thus far. Different and delicious! It was perfectly seasoned. Since the gravy is prepared differently, the waitress asked us if we'd like to try a sample of the gravy first before committing to the dish, but I was already set on getting this dish and needless to say, I was really glad I ordered this! Most places overly salt the crap out of the biscuits AND the gravy, but not here! You won't be disappointed!. . Hashbrowns: Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I don't know how to describe the exact seasoning, but it's not just S&P. It's surprisingly good! Crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside without being mushy. Mmmmm, more please!. . French Toast: Standard, but still satisfying. It's hard to make French toast really stand out unless you get fancy with flavors.. . Sausage Patties: Great flavor and cooked well! I hate places that cook the freakin' meat out of the damn patty to where it is hard and dry!. . Cinnamon Roll: By far the most disappointing thing ever! It did not taste like a cinnamon roll...plus the icing was all powdered sugar. I prefer the cream cheese based icing for cinnamon rolls, or if you're just going to go with the powder sugar icing, at least flavor it in some way so it tastes more than just wet powdered sugar. Yuck. I feel like the Pillsbury crap is better and tastes more like a cinnamon roll. I wouldn't buy this ever ever ever again.. . A must try for a hearty American breakfast if you're in that kind of mood!
Let me preface with this bias. I am not a American style breakfast fan. I grew up with a lot of traditional light Taiwanese porridge foods so heavy eggs and carbs in the morning is definitely not my thing. . . However, Mr. Mama's impressed. Any other place would've left a taste of childhood disgust in my mouth but the service, speed and overall attentiveness of the staff made the experience worth it. . . My sister order the Mama's French toast, I ordered one piece of french toast, white chocolate pancakes and an egg. . . All of them were alright by my taste buds!. . Expect good service when you get there :). . The food is nothing too extraordinary though (but that's just my opinion - coming strictly from someone who doesn't like American style breakfast foods)
Loved the bacon and the service. My husband also enjoyed his Denver omelet. A refreshingly tasty breakfast at a reasonable price when you have been eating on the overpriced strip for a few days.
Located in an industrial building but don't let that scare you off. The place was packed and had a 15 minute wait which our friendly greeter informed us of. It was well worth the wait! Great food, service, and staff. I had the biscuits and gravy, probably the best I've had.
We just left Mr mamas after finding it on Yelp the owner could not have been more personable the waitress was so friendly we could not have felt more at home great people food was great great presentation great service again you couldn't have been better PR than the owner
Thanks to Yelp we found this great little breakfast place while visiting Las Vegas. It's away from the strip, located in the middle of an industrial plaza. . We went on a weekday and waited about 15 min to be seated. We were greeted warmly and offered coffee while we waited. The coffee was excellent. When I asked the waitress about it, she said that they grind the beans in house. The food was also very good and the service was outstanding. . The ambience wasn't my favorite -think strip mall diner-noisy and crowded. The friendly owner was walking around greeting everyone and told us that they're planning to move to a nearby larger location early next year. . We like to support local businesses and will look for Mr. Mamas new location the next time we're in Las Vegas.
AmazeBalls!!! Had the country fried steak and a pancake and boy o boy did it hit the spot!!!  The guy who takes down the names is so welcoming you'll feel your part of the family. The waitress is so attentive even though I didn't know her name, but from what I saw every waitress was on point! Definitely coming back this will be my Vegas come to breakfast joint!
This was our first time here and since we are from out of town I chose this place solely on yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. the staff were kind and welcoming and the food was just like home, only better as i didn't have to cook it. .. or clean up.
Yeah. Just go. It was great. Nick was friendly as hell. And a Michigander to boot.  Excellent food and service.
All I can say is --  if you're in Las Vegas go here for breakfast!!!  Nick, the owner greets you at the door with a smile and a sense of humor.  That alone would get me to like the place.  But , the food is amazing.  I'm not normally a breakfast person but I ordered the Cali omelet with hash browns and I would go back tomorrow and have it again.  The omelet was light and fluffyand the hash browns were the best I've ever had.  As a bonus, the service was top notch !!!
Becoming a tradition when passing through Vegas. Hardy food at good prices. Very friendly staff.
This place was wonderful! The owner greeted us at the door by opening the door for us. He then told us which plates on the menu were his favorites! The Chicken Fried Steak was so tasty the amount of flavor was just right. The Cali Omelet was cooked to perfection! This along with the welcoming atmosphere made this place one for the record books and we will return again!
This place was DELISH! !! Their biscuits & gravy are to die for.  So was the country fried steak, pancakes and french toast. We had a feast and loved every bite.  Def coming back on my next vegas trip!
When looking for a breakfast place & a restaurant has over 800 reviews, well, I knew we'd come here. . . A really clean & nice looking restaurant located in a strip mall. . . We had the Greek omelet, biscuits & gravy plus hashbrowns. . . The addition of garlic to the Greek omelet made it go from ordinary to extraordinary! Fresh ingredients & liberal use of feta cheese was tasty. . . The gravy was sausage, bacon & maple syrup. It was bad a**! Very different & lighter than usual gravy. Biscuits were homemade & were light and flaky.
i got to say there is not enough stars here to rate this place, the best food i have ever had if it wasnt for the fact that i work at lees autocare i would have never knew this place existed, but from the massive lines that gather outside this place, you know its a hit just about everything i have eaten here was the best big portions great prices the service is out of this world, and nick the owner stands out front and greets the customers and talks to the customers table by table, i watch him a lot what a great guy, the cooks are very good and friendly, even when i went there on a sunday with my girlfriend we waited 40 minutes my girlfriend got fussy i told her to be patient because it will be worth waiting for and she waited with me when it was all said and done she agreed it was the best she ever had she loves it at mr mamas as well as i do to i wont eat any where else, im sold as being as small as it is and hard to see its a good place, and very blessed with business, keep up the great job everyone from mr mamas from all of as at lees autocare, and everyone that knows about you from the M casino where my girl works all her coworkers rave over mr mamas my girl says she hears the great reviews chatter about mr mamas keep up the great work we all love you guys there is not enough stars to give you guys this place over exceeds 7 stars.
Make your product just a little better than the competition. A little more freshness. A friendlier smile. Something to differentiate with consistency. Oh, and be in the right place. A general recipe for success in a market full of competitors. Mr. Mama's does exactly this.. . What are your choices around town? Egg & I? The Cracked Egg? Whatever. This is your spot. "But Ardie, they pretty much all have the same menu!" Well, here's that recipe for success on my veggie omelette.. . 1. Everyone is happy! You're greeted happily and waited on happily.. 2. More. You're getting another egg in your omelette. Yes, 4-egg omelettes. They're huge! You're getting lots of toppings. In my case, plenty of fresh veggies.. 3. The eggs are cooked right. I mean, seriously, I'm not sure I can do better. They got this down. But just so you know, they default to cooking in butter. I requested oil on my veggie omelette.. 4. The home fries are not over-seasoned abominations laying around until they're ready to be scooped. These are simple sliced potatoes. They came out hot, crispy, and topped with fresh chopped peppers and onions if you want them.. 5. The hash browns are crispy and not too greasy.. 6. Everything isn't salty! I'm talking to you, every other breakfast place ever. You don't need to salt everything.. 7. Price was veryreasonable at a mere $8.. . That's really all it takes. Do everything a little better, at the right price, and be in the right place.. . Next time, I'll be trying another omelette, or maybe those monstrous burgers I've been seeing so many pictures of. I'll be back!
Totally lived up to the hype!!! That's all I gotta say, great service and great food!
This place was so pleasant to visit! The owner told us a story about his family and how he started the restaurant. Staff was very attentive. Everything tasted fresh! I had the veggie omelette with home fries and English muffin. Can't wait to try more items off the menu.
I joined my friend for breakfast here. It was new for both of us. We ordered the breakfast burrito. And it was delicious with the right amount of ingredients and not very heavy. The other dish we ordered was the Mr. Mama's Chicken fried steak. It came with eggs, fried steak, gravy, biscuits, and hash browns. Everything was tasteful, fast service, and friendly staff. I recommend this place. Happy eating!
Had a wonderful meal, and the service was fantastic. Was greeted warmly as soon as we walked in made us feel right at home. Take the time to go around to each table and check how your meal is, even talk to everyone trying to find a connection with everyone. The food is top notch made from scratch and you leave feeling satisfied. Service is unbeatable and i was highly impressed for this being my first time there. I'm most definitely going back and the prices are very reasonable. Love the atmosphere and pretty light blue painted walls. Ihop has no chance next mr. Mama's lol.
This place is what a local Las Vegas business is all about.  We actually waited 20 minutes to sit down and it was worth it.  Prices were good, service was good, place was clean, food was great!!!  I would definitely recommend this place for a great old fashioned, homemade breakfast.. . Well done!
Yummy in my tummy :). . Service: My friend and I were greeted when we came in, escorted to table, and checked on often. Quick effortless refills, prompt billing, and the guy (assuming to be the owner) walked to the door and opened it for us when we were exiting and thanked us for having breakfast with them. Nice people they got here.. . Food: Greek omelette was so yummy. You can taste each ingredient which complimented each other so well. At first I was worried that it had garlic because I don't want it to be overwhelming but it was delicious and balanced the dish. Hash browns had great texture.  My friend thinks they lightly butter it for the crispiness.. . Coffee is so smooth. Nothing like the bitter taste of Starbucks. $2.50 cup with free refills. Faaantastic.
