Very cool place. Nice staff. Sat at the bar and ordered the "Rising Sun" made with Kobe beef. Super yummy. Order that one for sure medium rare to get the Kobe flavor. They have a great choice of beer. They even have one of my favorite beers Franziskaner Hefeweizen. A perfect fit for any burger. Oh yes that place made the burger indeed medium rare. Most joints overcook the meat. The price is alright for what you get. Definitely not overpriced.
Truly one of the best burgers I've ever had. Big, juicy, and flavorful. . . This restaurant is hip, fun, and chill. Good place to have a burger and be rowdy with your friends. . . I ordered the steakhouse burger with sweet potato fries. Even though it was huge, my burger has such depth of flavor that I was happy to devour all of it. It was spices on top of other spices. It was just delicious. This made me into a burger fan (only a fan of In-n-Out burgers before). . . There are layers and layers of flavors and goodness in each burger. Your taste buds won't be disappointed here.
Delicious, great fun burger combinations. Extra rich and super sweet shakes and amply sized. Underwhelming sides.. . Since it's Vegas, there's no point in stressing about the price, since everything is at least 50-100% marked up than what it should be.. . The Rising Sun was truly an innovative combo: Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado. Be warned, the Crispy Yam is merely just grated fried yams. The tempura avocado is extremely excellent though. But I mean, how do you go wrong with deep-fried fat? (For further reading: Fried Butter). . The Thai Steak Salad was barely average: Grilled Steak, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Romaine Lettuce, Green Papaya, Mint, Cilantro, Roasted Peanuts, tossed in a Sweet-chili Vinaigrette. The steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and I usually expect a sweeter sauce with my "Asian" salads, but the Sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.. . The regular fries & the sweet potato fries were mediocre at best, but the Onion rings were crisp, firm, and delicious.. . USEFUL: EVERYTHING IS SUPER SALTY. EVERYTHING. Water will get you nowhere. My lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what I was eating. I was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air I breathe. I may try to ask for "Less salt" if I ever go back!
I visited on a Thursday evening with my coworkers after an all day accounting conference. Needless to say, we were ALL ready to get our drink on, but being with the boss, (sort of)reigned it in. We got an assortment of dishes, and there was no complaints. Everything was pretty much awesome, particularly the ahi tuna and Turkey Tom Sliders - def get the Turkey Tom yum! My Green Pasture salad was solid and the Pork Street taco apps and Onion Rings (huge) were phenomenal. I ended up going with a vodka soda for my drink of choice and they were pouring those suckers stiff, which was much appreciated! My only regret is I did not get the spiked Grasshopper Milkshake, but tomorrow is another day! Can't wait to hit this place up the next time I am in Vegas!
I've eaten here twice and both times it was a disapointment, I'd be a fool to come back a third time.
After seeing the place on the Food Network,we decided it was someplace we wanted to visit while we were in Vegas.  . . Made a reservation on Open Table while at the MGM for a show, and took a stroll down the strip and made it in plenty of time before our reservation. Situated in the Cosmo it's pretty easy to find if you just follow your nose.   They were happy to seat us early even though it was a little busy.  . . The menu is a bit to take in as there is so much that looks so good... how do you decide.  I opted for the Holstein Beef sliders and my companion went for something a little more spicy the El Caliente.  . . My sliders were really good.  Not over cooked, and a great size for the buns they were served on.  And as everyone else has stated, the homemade ketchup ROCKED!  . . I'm not really into the spicy stuff, but I did have a small taste and it was pretty good.  I could also tell by the lack of conversation and the amount of time it took him to eat it.. was later reported to be very good and a decent size for a large appetite.   I was able to snake a few of his fries and could really only finish 2 of the 3 sliders so they worked out well.  . . it's always fun to explore new places when you are out of town.  Stop in and explore this place for sure.
I had what was truly the best burger I've ever had here (steakhouse burger). The shakes are generous portions and the service was good. Nothing besides the burger itself was mind-blowing, though, and this place is expensive - not by Vegas standards, just by normal city standards. Anyway, I'll visit again next time I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan.
Just based on beer selection I give it a 4, they have a good variety but man is it expensive!
warning: this review is a few months late.. . I do remember this place though, so thats a plus considering most things in vegas are a blur. we stopped in here after sleeping all day and taking one look at burgr and walking away immediately.. . me and a friend both got the gold standard burger and I also gota drunken monkey shake. I loved the shake. Personally I thought the burger was just normal, maybe even a tiny bit dry. . . This was more a fun atmosphere kind of place. Sitting at the bar waiting for the food, we were surrounded by really friendly people, and cougars. Bartender was really cool too so overally it was a good experience.. . A bit pricey but its vegas.
It's both a blessing and a curse that that Vegas is so far away, otherwise I'd be visiting Holsteins on a far more frequent basis.. . In contrast to the sharp trendiness of the Cosmopolitan Hotel itself is Holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word "indulgence." . . Our wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a Monday lunchtime visit - so I wouldn't be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.. . According to the restaurant's website, Holsteins no longer offers its Crispy Calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. The calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. The Tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. I hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that I've had in recent memory!. . For our burger selection, we shared a "Fun-Ghi" Burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. Indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave the burger an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. Thepatty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.. . We also split an order of Truffle Lobster Mac-N-Cheese (might as well go all in if you're indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). In contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn't overly rich or oily. Its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented the burger quite well. . . In sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and I were pretty much stuffed. The portion sizes were bigger than what we're accustomed to getting for the price (cough, Umami, cough). This being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is Sin City after all.. . We didn't get a chance to try any of the famed Holstein's "adult" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. In particular, the "Red Velvet Cake Shake" really jumps off of the page!. . While the whole "high-end burger" scene seems to be flourishing into quite the business these days, places like Holsteins prove that there are ways to excel at both image and execution. I'll certainly be back.
I wasn't as much of a fan as others it seems.  The staff was very nice.  The place was a bit loud.  I sat at the bar and had a drink while I ordered some food to go.  I got the fried pickles.  The first bite was tasty but they were really really salty (both the pickle, the breading and the sauce that came with it).  Interesting they were fried spears vs. fried slices like I'm used to but I liked that part.  I got the gold standard burger and didn't really like it (esp. for $20).  It was a bit greasy, needed seasoning,and when I asked them to add avocado they added guacamole to it (not the same!).  I probably would try something else before coming back.
We went here based on the Yelp reviews -- we are in Vegas so much that trying a new spot was necessary.  While totally aimed at the tourist, I have to say that the vibe was amazing  and loud.  By amazing I mean everyone was having fun and enjoying their meals.. . Everything was big and over exaggerated, which is exactly what you look for in Vegas.  It didn't matter that the food wasn't exactly perfect, it was that they tried and the presentation was fun.. . The milkshakes are to DIE for and was really filling and oh so devilishly yummy. . . Unfortunately the burger was not so much.  I mean...it IS a burger place.  It was more bun than bang :-(. . So 4 stars for fun, but outside of Vegas this place would flop on quality of burger.
Holsteins, has been around during this whole burger time fad and I've dinned their quite a few times.  Maybe the burger fad has wore off on me, but it was just ok. $15 for a plain burger, it should have been awesome, to me and my guest it had a odd, kind of funny taste. Like it was old.   It looked great on the plate, burger was nice and thick, wasn't dry, condiments seemed fresh.  My guest really like the onion rings, but I found they had too much bread.   Crunchy and crisp, but the onion to bread ratio was off.  For only an extra $2, for the rings, that's not bad. There shakes are always good.  To me a burger bar is about that piece of meat, the stuff on top should compliment it. It's all about burger,which tasted bad. Sorry Holsteins, I love your location, decor and service. You just have to fix what's between the bun.
I'm not sure if I was just starving... but we came here for dinner before going out and we were seated right away which was kind of surprising. I got the Gold standard burger and man was it good. The waiter recommended the steakhouse or the gold standard saying that it was award winning and their most popular. I definitely, agree because I definitely scarfed down the burger. The cheese they used with the bacon and the arugula and their aioli. It was perfect together, nothing was too overpowering, which was nice. . I would definitely come back here again to try out a different burger. I thought their prices were on the higher end but I guess you're in Vegas, so nothing you can do about that.
Although I absolutely hate The Cosmopolitan, I was really happy to find this place. Every single time I visit the Cosmopolitan I have a horrible experience. Whether it's the disgraceful customer service, the trashy clientele, the pathetic excuse for pool attendants-- it all sucks. So when my cousin asked us to meet her and her parents here, I was crazy skeptical. I was honestly just gonna grab a coke and eat somewhere else later. I'm so glad I didn't. I had the "Gold Standard" burger with Onion rings and it was, by far, the best burger I've ever had. My mom had the classic with regular fries and we both spilt an order of the fried pickles (which were also, the best I've ever had). For both of us the check came out to $63. I would have paid twice that much for a burger of that quality. Seriously just amazing. If you love a good In-n-Out burger, you'll love this place. They put "Umami Burger" to shame and need to be in a category all to themselves. I can't wait to eat here again.
Ass holes! Sign said open until midnight. We arrived at 11:30 and they would not seat is. Nuff said.
Ate here this past week while I was in Vegas for work. I'm not a big fan of restaurants on the strip. In in the past I have found that no matter the famous chef associated with the restaurant or the price point, the food is generally meh at best.. . Holsteins was a very pleasant surprise. I wasn't overly hungry so I ordered the signature sliders and the frozen grasshopper boozy shake. It was plenty of food. In fact, I didn't even touch the extra shake that came with my order. Both the sliders and the shake were delicious and I left feeling stuffed. . . Prices were totally reasonable for downtown Vegas, and overall the service was great. One thing that was a little odd is that they don't seem to bring you water as a default - you have to ask for it (even plain tap water). . . Will definitely return when work brings me back to Vegas.
Definitely one of the top burger places I've been to. Service is great and food comes out quickly. . Pros. -burger is juicy and tasty (everything was right about it)...thinking about it makes me hungry again. And they're not stingy with the portions!. -food came out in less than 20minutes . -our server/bartender was very patient and attentive. Explained what was popular/what he recommended. -their sweet potato fries were heavenly (order them as a side! They come in a bigger tin) . -they had boozy shakes that looked absolutely delicious. If I wasn't so stuffed already, I would've totally ordered one. . . Cons. -there was a wait for a table (we came at 930pm) so we just found a spot at the bar. . Highly recommend this place!
While on a business trip, I stopped over and had the Gold Standard and an IPA. The beer and the burger were great!  But the best thing Holsteins has going is their bartender Toshi!!  He gave me awesome suggestions from what id like to drink and eat as well as top secret spots in Vegas I'd enjoy!!
Where to start. We had been up for roughly 24 hrs when we sat down at midnight to eat dinner. I was whatever a combination of sick, shitfaced and sleep-absent is and got a drink with ginger beer in it that tasted fantastic and immediately made me feel worse; this I was expecting so no deductions. The in house dj had his system up far enough to interfere with those ears trying to make sense of the Bellagio fountain coordination a mile away but no matter-he was great and had enormous hair. I got a Kobe burger with chips, garlic pickles , and something red on it and it was perfect despite the waitress leering at me when I asked for it well. The french fries came in an exciting metal pail that apparently had been heated in an oven since earlier inthe week, and didn't cool down prior to us leaving. We also had the mini tacos which were small but no points deducted as the menu called them effing small so whatever. The girls and their black dresses left for the Marquee Club and a petite Indian man who would welcome them into his private tent and Robert and I ordered another drink and went to find the Cosmo poker room which doesn't exist.
This is a great burger place. The meat of the burger was amazing, the creativity and flavors of the different burgers were delicious. The shakes are good but just as expensive as your meal.
I had the Fun-Ghi - $17 - 4/5 pretty good.. Beef w/ caramelized onion, mushroom, and truffle mayo.  The burger was solid.  Bread texture was nice. Onions and mushrooms were nice & caramelized.  Truffle mayo was good.  . . Pecan Turtle Cheesecake Milkshake - $13 - Okay - 3/5. The pecan turtle cheesecake milkshake was pretty good.  It tasted like a cheesecake milkshake.  . . Red Velvet Shake - $13 - Taste average, 3/5. The Red Velvet shake wasn't anything special.  I really enjoy red velvet and this tasted whatever.. . PROS:. -FREE popcorn appetizer.  Tastes like crack.. -Burgers are solid. -Shakes are REALLY big.  Just order 1 shake and split that between 2-3 people.  Trust me on this.. . CONS:. -Shakes are pricey at ($13 each).  . -Hard to taste the alcohol in the milkshake.  I think next time I'll just get a vanilla milkshake.. -Burgers are pricey.  Most are more than $15.
Las Vegas Burger Mission Part 3 took place just a couple weeks ago, and my travel companion and I decided on Holstein's. It did not disappoint one bit.. . Right out of the gate, things were looking good....we found the place in the Cosmopolitan hotel easily, we were seated without a wait (it was a late Tuesday afternoon), and our waiter looked like Jared Leto. I like Jared Leto. Sweet. . . I decided to go with a Black and White Shake (like Jerry Seinfeld's black and white cookie, but in milkshake form, and it didn't make me puke) and the Rising Sun Burger. If I ever go back to Holstein's, I might have to get the same thing...I loved both. I particularly got into the tempura avocado on the burger. My pal got the Steakhouse Burger and the Birthday Cake shake, which had cake flavored vodka in it. Let me just say this....the person who invented cake flavored vodka deserves some sort of a Nobel Prize, and my friend who decided her life's problems could be washed away with a combination of ice cream and booze deserves some sort of a prize as well....because that's just awesome. And surely explains in part why we have been pals since 1975. Anyway, she enjoyed her burger and shake as much as I enjoyed mine. . . Burgers come with fries....nice that you don't have to order them (and pay for them) separately. We were both disappointed in the fries at BurGR, so the fry test here was paramount....alas, great fries. Big Sigh Of Relief. . . To top it off, Jared Leto was the perfect server and took good care of us. Oh hell, give him a prize, too...maybe an Oscar.. . If you're looking to try one of the many burger places on The Strip, be sure to consider Holstein's. And say hi to Jared for me.
Another great meal at Holsteins. We love this place. My husband stuck to his usual the gold standard- I tried another one (so many to try why not?) the Rising sun. I opted out of the mayo ( I tend to not like to much sauce) and didn't miss it! The tempura avocado was ok- kind of through me off so didn't eat it but the rest of it was amazing. Better than the last one I tried which was the BBQ one. An 8/10 and my husband says 10/10 again. I did have cold sweet potato fries and when I mentioned it to my server he brought me fresh instantly. These burgers are always worth the price.
Terrible service. All waitresses seem to be in training; they're more interested in talking to each other or watching the TV. Most of all, after complaining about to the manager, he didn't seem to care.
Great experiences.  Service provide by Jade was awesome.   The place was packed, but the service was nice and quick.  Very knowledgable about the menu and gave us some great suggestions.  I ordered the fried pickles to start off.  They where delicious and complimented well with the caper mayo.  For my main course I ordered the Rising Sun with sweet potato fries.  The burger was pretty tasty,  but my fries where a little cold and soggy.  I also had the Maple Bacon shake, which was pretty good.  Great vibe in the restaurant.  Overall experience was great.  The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because when we walked in the smell was pretty bad, like the tables where wiped down with dirty rags. Other than that I would recommend trying this place out!
