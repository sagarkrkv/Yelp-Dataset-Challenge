Right smack dab in the midst of Mandalay Place.  Super convenient.. . I simply LOVE this place. It's a great venue for large groups as well as smaller crowds.. . I have eaten here numerous times. 1st time I ever saw and tried the now popular "sweet potato fries.". . I did find my last few times here that rather than ordering my burger "medium rare" or "medium" I had to tell them what color I wanted it.  I had to send my burger back 2 or 3x otherwise.  Now I know.  Tell them what color you want it and see how they define that before you place your order. Then you'll get to enjoy your meal with your date or your friends, not 1 hour later.
Good lunch spot when visiting Vegas. I enjoyed our food. We ordered an appetizer(hot wings) they were yummy and the bloody marries tasted oh so good. Great burger wonderful choices and fantastic customer service. I'll be back for sure.
Really delicious. On the expensive side for a burger if you like a lot of toppings, but has always been delicious. Love the truffle sauce and every combination of burger I've had. Service is good, pretty decent drinks as well.
awesome place, l was here for convention week the food is delicious, definitely recommend this place and will stop by for my next visitation
Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I built my own with Angus beef, bacon, Swiss cheese, sauteed onions and red wine-shallot reduction.  Not to brag or anything, but I'd put it up against any of the "pre-built" burgers they have on their menu.  And the jalapeno onion petals are amazing.. . The service here is pretty great, despite how busy it was when we went.  Our waitress was really friendly and attentive.. . The only real drawback is that if you build your own burger, the cost of additional toppings can add up pretty quick.  The concoction I mentioned above was close to $20, but considering they have a $60, it didn't seem so bad.. . I can't wait to go back and Hubert Keller has himself a new fan.
I've been wanting to try Hubert Keller's Burger Bar for so long.  Stopping here before seeing Aziz Ansari at Mandalay Bay made such an amazing night!  Hubby and I sat at the bar and I had the Med-Rare NatureSource burger with Brie, Sauteed baby spinach, and truffle mayo on the plain bun.   Oh Em Gee!  Probably the best burger I've ever eaten.  Hubs had the Kobe burger with brie and a fried egg with L&T on a plain bun.  His was killer as well ... though my "Annie Burger" was tops in my book -- and that's the beauty of BYOB!  Fat fries. Couple of glasses of wine, a decent (for LV, we're from SD!) glass or two of beer and we were happy,. happy, and ready to laugh :)
My husband wants to know if yelp will refund the money we spent on one of the worst meals we have ever had in Las Vegas. Seriously, the food came out room temperature  (at best ), the fries were soggy to the point of almost being undercooked. My husband ordered provolone on his & it came with no cheese. I ordered very light bleu cheese on mine and it had about a quarter cup piled on it.  The soda he ordered was diet  (which he hates) so they couldn't even get our beverage order correct. Worse of all, we both ordered our burgers medium-well and they were rare to the point that we couldn't even eat around the edges.  Not even juicy, lacked flavor and served on a cold potato bun made me actually lose my appetite.  Usually I love aeoli but theirs was so garlicky I had to mix it with the mayonnaise that we also had to request just so I could dip the pathetic fries in it. I did eat the tomato, the modest little slice that was served on the side.  Honestly, it made me not want another burger any time soon!  Epic fail!
Located conveniently between Mandalay Bay and The Luxor, Burger Bar delivers a juicy meaty burger for a decent price!. . The Burger Bar is a casual place with pop music piping throughout the restaurant and sports on the millions of televisions they have.  Each booth has their own television for you to catch a game or two so you'll never miss a game.  It's clean and modern and just dimly lit enough for you to feel relaxed.  . . I had "The American Classic" while Mr. W. had the "Hubert Keller Burger."  Both were super delicious, hit the spot, and cooked to a perfect medium..  I really enjoyed the buffalo meat in the HK burger and that red wine and shallots sauce was crazy good.  I liked dipping my skinny fries in there.  My burger was crazy big while the HK seemed to be a smaller portion.  Is this normal?  It was my first time stopping by!  I had originally wanted to try the "Spicy Lamb Burger" but I was afraid it would be too spicy.. . While Burger Bar isn't my burger place of choice on The Strip, I definitely wouldn't hesitate to stop in again!
A group of us ate here during Frozen Fury a couple of weeks ago. Very cool decor, tables and giant sized booth. There was six of us and we all fit in the booth. Plus the booth had a tv which was playing hockey! I had the hangover burger and not only was it delicious it actually worked (could have been a placebo) but whatever works. Great place tograb some food!
I got a burger there and as soon as I ate it I felt ill, went back to my hotel room and threw up about two hours later.  Had diarrhea for the next 3 days.  I hadn't eaten anything for about seven hours before that, so pretty sure that's the only place I could have gotten food poisoning from.  Ruined my trip to Vegas pretty much.  I emailed the restaurant and Mandalay bay about it, never got a reply.  Never going back there again.
Cheap happy hour deals but really let me down on the taste buds.  . . . I truly believe that America is the masters of wings and chicken tender strips. Not here unfortunately.. . The chicken tenders what such a small portion it was borderline pathetic.. . The sliders were probably among the worst I have ever had.. . To be fair the drinks are cheap but the food is poor.. . I am giving it 2 stars for happy hour value.
I had a friend visiting from England and we decided to meet here since this is located at the hotel where he was staying at. I have never been to burger bar, so I was really excited, knowing it is owned by a renowned chef. I ordered the Twinkie Shake and the American burger with extra caramelized onions. Sad to say, they sound better than they taste. The burger was dry and lacked flavor, and the shake wasn't really anything to race about. I did love the zucchini fries, but that's about it. Service was also just okay. Overall, I was just very unsatisfied and felt like it was a complete let down compared to all the hype. Not sure if I will be back again.
We wanted to order healthy and both ordered a turkey burger, one with ciabatta bread and the other with whole wheat and I ordered mine with avocado and a side order of salad and the other order had a side of coleslaw.  I also ordered the tropical iced tea which was peach flavored and it has free refills.  We wanted a healthy and close place to eat since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay and this place filled the bill.
always go in and ask to sit in Jessica's section. she is the best and such a sweetie. I had the #9 beer and some sliders always a good combo!
Jalepeno bacon and a pretzel bun made my first meal in vegas delicious. Good service and good beer selection.
My husband and I both had the salmon burger. Server said it was great- otherwise I wouldn't order that. It was a full thick salmon- filet, not crab cake style like I expected. I built my burger with Smoked Gouda, Caramelized onions and avocado. Omg. I ordered zucchini fries, really good- andserver graciously brought out the ranch!  They had a huge selection of fries. My husband got guacamole for his salmon and the shoe string fries. It was delicious. It's a definite go.  :). It's in a shopping mall, no patio. Otherwise food is great. :)
I cannot believe I just spent $44 at the Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay. Please, if you want a burger in Vegas, go to a local or national chain, not here. The burger was still over cooked even after being sent back once. There is absolutely no reason for the cost of that burger. Just another fleecing in Vegas. Guard your wallet, eat at In& Out. Doesn't even deserve a star.  . . My wife and I spent the day reviewing blog posts, urban spoon, and other internet burger rankings of restaurants in Vegas.  All of these critiques must have been completed by people without taste buds, or a since of value.  I am aware that Vegas is a town perfectly designed to take your money, but this is ridiculous. The chef that has proudly placed his name on this poor excuse of a restaurant should be forced by his peers to renounce his proclamation as chef.  Seriously, I have had better burgers at Denny's.
Starving and my sister was in town on business. Since she was staying at Mandalay Bay, & we were both craving burgers, we decided to go to Burger Bar. Since my sister had eaten here before, & said it was good, I trusted her judgement. The wait was not long & 5 minutes under the 15 minute wait time given. The Hostesses were very nice & polite. I could care less for our waitress, as she was young and not too eager to help out with the menu selections. . . Our food however was delicious!! We both ordered custom beef burgers on a pretzel bun, cheddar cheese, bacon n onions with sweet potato fries. Juicy meat, cooked to order as a true medium, soft bun, fresh toppings and bacon was crisp along the the fries!! The sweet potato fries were a little too sweet for me, so next time, I will order the fat fries instead. . . We ordered shakes to go with our meals, they did not disappoint!! I had the adult Vanilla French Kiss shake made with coffee liquor, while my sis opted for the Salted Caramel shake. Both creamy, delicious & not too overly sweet!!. . We were seated at a booth with our own personal TV which was great, since the Charger vs. Broncos football game was on!!. . I would definitely come back to Burger Bar!!
Love the burgers and shakes, alcoholic and non alcoholic. Good beer selection.. I build my own with a fried egg with the pretzel roll. It is pricey but this is one place I almost always go to when in Las Vegas.
Service is always on point, and food is outstanding. Want a great burger? Look no further.
I live in San Francisco and the Burger Bar here is alright. I've been once and haven't had the desire to return. So when I went to Vegas my friend said I HAD to go to this Burger Bar because it was going to make up for San Francisco. . . It didn't. It was so much worse, oh man. BurgerKing is legitimately better than what I ate here, their chicken tenders are actually tender. The sliders were dry and the bread was stale. French fries tasted like cardboard that was fried in oil that had old sneakers in it before it started boiling.
