Finally found a parking spot less than five miles away. That's where any negative comments end. The place is beautiful, well-run and all the staff is also attractive. We decided they must all be underwear models in their spare time. Male and female undie models serving awesome beer and food. The wings were good, grilled or not. Pizza was good, too. The place is a huge farm-style building with vaulted roof, beer brewing tanks in the corner, calling your name. "Beeeeeer." Well, that's my name when I am out. Tons of coeds and old folks, too. Sports on in every crevice, TONS of seating. Parking is sole issue. And  that is not as much a problem going in as it is staggering out after drinking that strong beer ..( Get a DD or the PO-PO will be after you)They don't call it Kilt Lifter for nothing. Get a growler on your way out for that "hair of the dog" that will be coming for you later.
Atmosphere: Pretty cool! Nice and big patio, industrial feel inside with all of the brewing equipment in view, and a mix of yuppies and college kids for lunch!. . Food: Fantastic. I've had two of the burgers (today was the Lamb burger) and they were both AWESOME, but the lamb was the best!!. . Beer: Great beer. Hop Knot is one of my favorites, and Kiltlifter does not need an explanation. . . Service: Pretty good; lot's of young yet competent servers. Even during a busy lunch it does not take very long to be helped. . . . Go check it out!
Awesome place... great beer
all the Beers are great, the Salmon BLT is a must try! fish n chips are excellent as well. in heart of a college atmosphere there are still a variety of people here. familes of all ages. couples, sports fan, and kids are all enjoying this historic brewery!
So no more... Amazing. Get the sampler to check out all the beers they have. Parking sucks but like a good woman ... It's worth the work!
good!
I've been in the Phoenix area a few months and my friend was insistent that I had to check this place out.  My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch, around 2:30pm on a Thursday.  There is no parking lot, you have to park along the street.  Since it wasn't a busy time, we didn't have any issues and were able to park about a block away.  I could see how it would be frustrating during peak hours.  . . The sign out front said to seat yourself.  There were plenty of tables in the outdoor patio area but we opted to sit indoors.  The interior of the place is really interesting.  It was clean and cool.  . . We started with the fried calamari appetizer.  It came it quickly and was awesome.  I was expecting the standard calamari rings, but these were long, panko-breaded strips topped with Parmesan.  There were crispy and tender.  For our meals, my husband and I both got the fish and chips.  Delicious!  Crunchy Kilt Lifter Beer Batter and flaky white fish.  For drinks, my husband had an 8th St IPA and a Pumpkin Porter.  He liked the 8th St but loved the porter.  He said it didn't taste as dark as it looked and was super smooth. . . One warning, the portions are huge!  We probably should have skipped the appetizer or shared the fish and chips.  I was so full I couldn't order any of the intriguing desserts.  The staff were great.  Our waitress checked in on us regularly, the food came out quickly, and our drinks never went empty without notice.  Great place!
Four Peaks is my go-to happy hour or casual dining spot when home in Phoenix.  It is one of Arizona's oldest microbreweries and since the demise of the historic A-1 brand, the closest thing we have to a state beer.  Many microbreweries these days seem to focus on bitter super-hopped beers with other varieties being a second-class after thought.  While Four Peaks does offer the hoppy Raj IPA and the even hoppier Hop-Knot, it also has a wide selection of other excellent award-winning offerings across the entire style spectrum including their flagship Kilt-Lifter Scottish amber ale, the mild SunBru and the creamy Oatmeal Stout (the closest thing to Guinness you will find this side of Ireland).  At the brew pub, they always have one or two special seasonals including the annual spicy Pumpkin Porter.  . . One would expect that a brew pub would have good beer, but what really sets Four Peaks apart from the rest is the excellent food.  Most brew pubs may have one or two stand-out dishes with most other items being more mediocre and less tasty than they sound.  However it is clear that Four Peaks has a true chef in the kitchen who is as innovative and passionate about the food as the brew masters are about the beer.  The Four Peaks burgers are among the best in Phoenix - large, juicy and perfectly cooked to order.  The attention to details shows in the trimmings - always fresh, large slices of lettuce, tomato and onion on a large fresh bun.  Likewise even the side salads (which are often no more than lettuce in most places) include mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, green peppers and croutons (in addition to their excellent homemade sweet jalapeno dressing).  Other stand-out items include excellent enchiladas, carne adovada, fish-n-chips, beer-battered fries, and several excellent appetizers including Thai hummus, killer nachos, and Arizona Chicken Rolls (a long fried spicy chicken and cheese egg roll).  All served in generous portions and very reasonable prices.. . What really shows the kitchen's innovation and artistry however are the daily dinner specials (usually 3) that are special custom creations that have ranged from fine dining to comfort food to off-the-wall inventive.  A few examples include duck manicotti in a cabernet sauce, a sandwich of fried chicken and gravy served between waffles instead of bread and (my sentimental favorite) homemade sloppy joes with tater tots.  Four Peaks is one of the few brew pubs I know that could be successful on its food alone even without the beer.. . The brewery is located on a neighborhood side street (8th Ave) near ASU in a historic brick building that used to be a creamery.  The large open inside has a huge wrap-around bar and several large TVs for sporting events and can get loud when busy.  I prefer the nice outside patio.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the wait staff is consistency friendly and attentive.  On weekends, there can sometimes be a wait for a table and parking (on the street) can occasionally be a challenge.   I have eaten at probably over four dozen brew pubs around the US and would rank Four Peaks among the top three for overall beer, food, service, and atmosphere.
Great place! Had their oatmeal stout wings with their freshly brewed hop knot ipa. Simply, amazing combo!!! I highly recommend checking out this brewery if you're ever in the Tempe, AZ area. You won't regret it. Cheers!!!!
I love it
Excellent food! Excellent waitress! We had the cheesy beer bread and the forty barrel steak and they were fantastic! We drove a half hour to eat here and it was so worth it! It was also a beautiful night to sit out on the patio. Also, it was a Monday night and the place was packed. I can see why!
I love Four Peaks beer, at any given time you can open my fridge and find a few of their brown bottles of bliss. I figured that the restaurant would be a hit as well. I took a date to the brew house on a Friday night, which meant a wait. We waited 10 minutes and we were quickly seated. A waitress came to use right away, and the service was great. Also the building and patio are really cool, great place to hangout! . . We got the pretzels for an appetizer, and they were great, especially with the cheese sauce, which is extra. I got a steak sandwich, and it was ok, not great. I think I ordered the wrong thing. I will have to go again to try food, but a great place to drink a few beers with friends!
I've been an aficionado of Four Peaks beers for a long time now, and I've always wanted to come here except there's never anywhere to park. Finally my husband and I visited a couple of times on off peak hours, and it was totally worth it.. . I don't think I've ever tried a Four Peaks beer I didn't like, but I particularly recommend the Raj IPA and Kiltlifter.. . As for the food, I really loved the Southwest burger I got on the first visit. Nothing makes me feel like I've wasted a huge chunk of my daily caloric intake more than a burger with a sad unseasoned patty, but the patty here was cooked perfectly medium on the inside with a delicious char on the outside. The jalapeno dressing was tasty as well. The fries were also excellent. I don't think I've ever had beer-battered fries before, but if I were on a stranded island with Four Peaks beer-battered fries trees, I think I could live with that.. . And although I typically love burgers more than life itself, on the second visit I got a Salmon BLT. I'm probably never going to get a burger again because this BLT was so good. I love salmon anyway, but it still had a balanced amount of B, L, and T, which I can barely ever find on a BLT that doesn't have salmon on it. . . In short, I really enjoyed Four Peaks Brewing Co and I'll be coming here a lot more to partake in their delicious comestibles.
Every one was really nice. The food was great. My son cannot handle over populated situations and this was the first successful going our experience for us. We will be back. Mac and cheese was on task today
Very nice place, only reason I gave it 4/5 is so many people.  People everywhere, why do people go to a place where people are supposed to go and be social and drink and eat?  Can I have a quiet section where I can eat alone with my pet cat, then go out to drink with friends in the noisy place again?  Otherwise, good, and amazing stout shake.
Guhhh so good. . . #Stoutamisu

Wow!!! Great food, inviting atmosphere, cold drinks and HOT women. . Heterosexual males and lesbians... This place is heaven.
I took some out-of-town family members to Four Peaks for quick dinner and beers.  It was not that quick, because even on Tuesday the place was packed, but as all the reviews state, the food was good and my family members enjoyed the beer.  I never acquired the taste for beer so I tried one of their "craft cocktails" per the waitress' suggestion.  This particular craft cocktail added muddled blueberries, blueberry vodka, and sweet and sour to the beer.  It ended up tasting like carbonated sweet and sour blueberry candy, and there is nothing wrong with that.. . The waitress also helped my nephew (a food engineer) choose a hamburger.  He agreed with her, in front of his empty plate, that it was a good burger.  It was very tall.. . There was one moment when my half-full craft cocktail and nearly full water cup sat in front of me. Across the table, a half-full beer and a half-full water cup sat across from my nephew.  Without any sudden movements, wild gesturing, movement of the table, person passing by, gust of wind, or flying bird - an almost filled cup fell on the floor. We were all startled by the loud sound of the glass breaking. The staff didn't miss a beat; seconds later, the glass and ice cubes were swept up and the floor was being mopped.  But, it begged the question, where did this random falling glass come from?  No one was missing a water cup or drink.  Nor did anyone see or feel the glass fall off the table.  Less than one minute later, the exact same thing happened at a few tables behind us!  Rumor is that the old building, which used to be a creamery, is haunted.   I don't believe in ghosts but I also don't have another suggestion.  Maybe the ghost from Casey Moore's came over to play?  Really, how many haunted bars can Tempe have!?
Since the first time that I went to Four Peaks I was hooked. From the friendly atmosphere, great servers, amazing beer and food this place is definitely one of my favorites that I go to a couple times a month. I have never had a bad experience of all the times that I have gone. Happy hour is great and always draws a big crowd. I always look forward to Fall because then I get to indulge in their Pumpkin Porter! Yummy. Highly Recommend going here.
Good food great beer nice atmosphere do I need to say more this place is by far the best Brewery in Az and the food is delious.
Can't go wrong with Four Peaks! Who doesn't love trying out a local brewery and chowing down on some good food? I've been here at least a dozen times, and have never had a bad experience. Try their seasonal Pumpkin Porter - it's delicious!. . My only tip is to get there early, especially if you have a large party - it's a popular spot and there is usually a wait!
Awesome place - the staff was so nice, welcoming us as it was our first visit to the brewery and helping us out with extra tasters and pita for our hummus. The brew pub is right in the brewery itself, so you're sitting near the big beer tanks. There's both inside and outside seating and plenty of it (of course it does fill up - we went around 4pm on Saturday and it was fine but a couple hours later there was quite the wait). Oh, and of course the beer was great too :) Great choice for a casual afternoon or night out with friends.
Great, hopknot ipa.  . tiramisu, wonderful for chocolate lovers
The green chile chicken mac & cheese with cajon spices has a nice kick and the salmon BLT you can't go wrong with.  Generous portions with good beer like the kilt-lifter, Raj and a Hef what more could you ask for?  Food & drink arrived so fast we thought surely it wasn't ours.  You have many choices for seating indoors, outdoors, bar etc.  Huge warehouse but this place has a good feel to it with a lot of cute waitresses.
Great nachos, has tours.  Had the nachos and they were great.  Make sure you dont get seated under a fan, cools your food to fast.  . . Beer is a plus!  I love Hefe and theirs was on point! #4 on my list.  . . Went to watch a football game on monday, wait was very minimal.
My girlfriend & I frequent Four Peaks because, well, it's rad... Tonight was no different except for the initial reception. We had our ID's ready because we know you check at the door, but no one checked it before the hostess started leading us back to our table. Then the security guard, who was MIA when we had our ID's ready, stopped us as if we were trying to sneak in (he was too busy flirting with a girl to notice that we had our ID's out the whole time) & stopped us as his co-worker was leading us to our table. We jokingly said "we've had our ID's out" and he was a jerk saying "obviously I'm a security guard & need your ID's." Oh, really? Obviously? You were too busy not doing your job & flirting with someone to notice that we had our ID's out from the start, then to be an ass when you notice that there are people walking in... No. I love Four Peaks & I will continue coming here, but Eric (the complacent security guard on 10/28/14 around 8pm) made us want to turn around & go somewhere else. Otherwise, Steven was an amazing server & the food ruled. Two thumbs up for food & service!
