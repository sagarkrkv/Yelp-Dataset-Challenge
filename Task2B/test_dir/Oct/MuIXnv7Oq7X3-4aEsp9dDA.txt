so good, double date night 4 of us we ordered few different things and everything was amazing!
Wish there was a zero stars ... over complicated food ... ruining fish ... they refused to sub anything! !! Diet restrictions be dammed I guess.. never go here if u have ANY diet restrictions. ..
Best cocktails and service in Scottsdale!!  I am never disappointed when I go to Citizen Public House.  The cocktails are unique and delicious (ask Thomas to make them for you, he's amazing), and the service is impeccable.  For dinner ask to sit in Sam's section; he is by far one of the most knowledgeable, on-point servers I have ever had.  All of his recommendations have always been phenomenal and he has a cadence about him that makes you feel like he is enjoying the dining experience as much as you are.. . Food standouts: Chopped Salad; Scallops; and the Tenderloin Wrap. Drink standout: Manhattan; trust me on this one, it's out of this world.
I ordered the scalloped seared. It was delicious the waiter was awesome the food was impeccable.
We came for happy hour/dinner and were glad we did. The less expensive wines drop to $5 during happy hour. We had some. Others had ice tea and Arnold Palmer.  We had olives and bacon popcorn snacks.  Three had a lamb burger which was good but not great.  I had a mortadella slider and it was good. The kennebec fries with the burgers tasted good but were very chewy. The almond and bacon brittle wasn't bad but difficult to eat after dinner. Service was very good. we will want to try it again.
Located in downtown Scottsdale, Citizen Public House serves classy gastropub food.  The server I had was great and even offered a kitchen tour while we were waiting for our food. This place is awesome.
Omg! My daughter heard about this place and we decided to check it out on one of my trips to Phoenix. We shared the piggy and waffle, and the Cobb salad. It was enough food for the two of us would even know my stomach was portruding, I could have kept eating another round of both! Since then I've been trying to make chicken and pancakes so I could get that combination of syrup and meats! Can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu next. And by the way, the Cobb salad was really unusual it had chopped smoked salmon pieces. It was fabulous!!
Favorite restaurant! The roasted buttermilk chicken and the chopped salad are amazing!
I love CPH. The servers are attentive, the atmosphere is lovely, food is delicious every time, and the cocktails are amazing and inventive.
Ok so I really wanted to love this place. Service was great. Chopped salad was a little weird but ok. The food was overall prepared well, just not to our liking. Unfortunately no one in our party was a fan of the food.
Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6.. The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu. . Hmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but "Fair" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth.. Luckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu. . . The final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?! . Here's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it. . Maybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/. Never dine here with a group more than 8.
Food was delicious but drinks were horrible!  Our table got the lamb burger (bun/bread way to much), buttermilk chicken and scallops.  We had to ask for everything and they have to little servers working.  I was shocked that the bartender did not know how to make drinks.  I mean so bad I could not drink them and sent them both back and mind you they were two totally different drinks :/  . P.S. Definitely not kid friendly!
The food and cocktails were great. The service was exceptional!  Highly recommend this place, we will be back!!!
Great Central location, amazing service at the bar. Happy hour drinks are very tiny, selection in small and they are all drinks that could put hair on your chest.
Below is an e-mail that I wrote to the establishment a few months ago onbehalf of my experience. I thought I would share it on Yelp, so I copied and pasted.... . . . I first want to apologize for taking so long to write to you to tell you about my experience. I was there for my birthday dinner on May 10th, 2014. My boyfriend had called to make reservations and get everything squared away without my knowledge. He couldn't keep it a secret anymore, and about an hour before the reservation, he spilled the beans and told me that we would be going to Citizen Public House for dinner. Right away, I remembered that this nice guy named Sam, who we had met through the gym, said he had worked there. I don't know Sam very well on a personal level, but we do say hello in passing at the gym. I suggested he call to see if Sam was working so we could sit in his section. Sure enough, our request was accommodated and we were seated in his section. He recognized us right away and was pleasantly surprised that we were there. . . Sam had asked us if we had dined there before, which we had not. I immediately made a comment about how everything on the menu looked good. Since he somewhat knew us, he asked if it would be ok for him to remove our menus from the table and allow him to surprise us throughout the night. I was stunned, and accepted his offer without any hesitation, giving him our full trust. He knows that I like eat healthier, so he informed me that he would be making some adjustments to the foods he would be choosing. Regardless of healthy eating, we splurged a bit, and Sam bought us tasters of some wine so we could choose a bottle. I enjoyed the options so much that I could not choose! ... but I did :) and it was wonderful!. . The first thing Sam brought out was your famous Chopped Salad. I have no words to describe this, other than the fact that I could probably eat this salad every day for the rest of my life. This was the one thing I was told about Citizen Public House, and was told that if I went, I had to try it! He brought it for us to split as an appetizer and I was happy with his selection, as we had wanted it right from the beginning. For the entrees, Sam brought us modified versions of the Buttermilk Chicken and the Amaro Meatloaf and described them fully upon arrival. We definitely would not have gotten the meatloaf off of the menu if we had chosen, but both were so amazing!! I couldn't tell you what he did to modify them specifically, but they were made to cater our health requests just a tad. Un...bel...ieve...able. To top off the night, Sam asked if our special food needs could be catered by a nice desert, because he said he wanted to celebrate my birthday with us. We hesitated, but then decided that we can't say no and would make an exception this one night! I am so happy that he asked before, rather than surprising us with dessert (yes, I know it usually goes the other way around), but it showed he cared about our requests. I don't think this dessert was on the menu, but it came in a jar and I think it had some peanut butter something in it... amazing, candle lit and all. . . Overall, my experience was beyond amazing. Not only was the food, drink, music, and ambience great, but Sam was exceptional. I don't think he took care of us just because he knew who we were... I truly believe that that is genuinely how he is as a person and a server! His knowledge is incredible, he is calm and confident in his performance, and he is willing to take a step above to make his guests happy. The funny part about this, is that I am also a server/bartender at a mid-high scale restaurant... and I can honestly say that Sam blew me away. I don't think any of our servers are up to his level, not even myself. You have a great employee on your hands and you should be proud to call him one of your staff members. I have been in the industry for 10 years now and I have never gone out of my way to write about how amazing someone is, but Sam is really that great!! We will definitely be back, and Sam is no longer just a guy I know at the gym, but he was one of the reasons why I had such a fantastic birthday this year and I will never forget the role he played that night.. . Thank you so much for the amazing experience!!! I refuse to keep my mouth shut about your amazing restaurant and Sam's service!!!
My family and I came for dinner. We enjoyed a few happy hour cocktails in a dim lit room which played a part to the comfortable and cozy atmosphere. For an appetizer we had the fondue and for dinner we had the pork chop, scallops, chicken, and short ribs. All were prepared and presented perfectly. Everything tasted wonderful and the bottle of st. Emilion we ordered was excellent. Needless to say, this restaurant is a definite success for a great experience.
This one was always on my list to try so I decided to check it out for a early Sunday dinner.  First of all, this place is in a perfect location in old town (and yes there is a patio). My friend and I did some splitting of dishes and that was just great. . . Started off with a sangria, which I would highly recommend, it was very flavorful and not your typical approach. For an appetizer, we went for the fondu, served with a Swiss type cheese along with pear, sausage and homemade bread. For the main course, we tried the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. The entree was served perfectly and they split it for us on two plates :) . . Our server was very friendly and helpful. She kept trying to keep our fondue warm and lit outside, but the wind kept blowing the flame out! I will absolutely come back to try different items on the menu :)
Amazing restaurant with amazing food!! Sam, our server, had such great recommendations. We had the burrata for starters, original chopped salad, braised short ribs, and for dessert, cocoa jar and financier. Omg. Amazing!!!! Our host, Lex, was awesome keeping up to date with the World Series score (since there's no tv's here). He's awesome too. Love love love this place. I will be coming back, especially when the speakeasy opens. Yeay!! So happy with new finds :)
Great experience and food in old town Scottsdale. The cocktails are inventive and fresh!  We loved the fondue and pork belly starter.  My dining partner loved the chicken breast even though he normally prefers the juicy dark meat. The lamb burger was tasty and juicy. Great bun! The chop salad was a big hit at our table. I loved the scallops. For dessert it was tasty and fresh. When we come back to Scottsdale we will be back.
Outstanding food and service!
