Hospedagem em abril/14.. Hotel antigo, cheiro de mofo, ar condicionado fraco e barulhento. Mas o visual e a localizacao sao incriveis. Ah, o preco tambem e baixo! . Na outra vez em que estivemos, ficamos hospedados no Trump... So de lembrar do conforto e luxo, ficamos bastante arrependidos. :(
PROS: Moderately priced, standard amenities, convenient location on The Strip, connected to Paris.. . CONS: VERY standard amenities, skimped on toiletries/towels, idle employees during check-in chaos.. . Would recommend to those not looking to spend a whole lot of money to be on The Strip.. . -----. . As the 3/5 stars review suggests, there is not anything too special about this place. It is your standard hotel/casino, neither a shit hole or a palace, that is conveniently located on The Strip: Across from Bellagio and Caesar's Palace, connected to Paris, and about a 5 minute walk to The Cromwell/Drai's day club. Because of these things, you would not be paying for top-notch amenities or amazing rooms, your money is investing in the great location. Staying here allowed us to walk everywhere we needed to go, inebriated and not. . . In terms of the room, unless you are staying in a suite or in a newly renovated room, it is really just a place to sleep and sober up. The only complaints I have are that during the height of check-in on Friday, there were employees that seemed to just be standing around and talking to employees that were actually working and struggling, and that the rooms had the very minimal toiletries and towels. . . Not a GREAT place to stay, but it is a place to stay if you are looking to wreck havoc in Las Vegas and do not plan on staying in the room very much. If you are going to be in the room for some time, the TV's have TNT movies at least.
Don't ever attend a show here unless you have your tickets in hand well before the show. Their will call system stinks. We showed up over 30 minutes before the show and waited in will call line at the box office for over an hour. By the time we finally got our tickets, they wouldn't let us in the theater. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The staff at the box office didn't seem to care that over 20 people in the box office line were going to miss the show.
Better than i thought it would be. Stayed here while traveling with work. Even got upgraded to a suite, all because i asked if there was any available. Great spot on the strip. Ideal for anyone on a low budget.
Painfully disappointing experience at Bally's Las Vegas. You could not even pay me to return. . . Room was refurbished and nicely decorated as well as clean. It was poorly situated with an outside night club at Paris blaring music into room until 3:00 am so that I couldn't sleep. . . Extreme difficulties getting connected, and staying connected to wifi so that I could not work. I spent hours and 6 calls on the phone with their IT Vendor, front desk/management and a visit from internal IT to resolve. Extremely poor customer service and lack of ownership in resolving problem. No internet instruction in room. . . Elevators were not working properly in tower. Waited 3-5 minutes for an elevator regularly. Was stuck once in elevator with another guest-call button did not work. . . Up charges and excessive fees to check in early/late, use phone, etc. . . Vending machine costs $3 for a drink-dispensed wrong drink. . . Lobby extremely smoky-lacking good ventilation. . . Charged $122 deposit upon booking. Did not provide a receipt so that I could expense to my company. Called hotel to obtain a receipt. After extremely long hold times, was told that I would be emailed a receipt-it was never provided. Asked for a receipt at check-in, Bally's could not produce a receipt of the expense reflecting the date that I was charged. . . Overall, extremely poor customer service and lack of ownership of problems/concerns. I will not be frequenting Bally's again.
They did not honor our reservation that was made 3 months prior to stay in the Jubilee Tower (the nice one). They put is in the indigo tower (very outdated with a very firm bed). They stated that they needed to keep available rooms for their 7 star guests..   Also, it has the oldest slot machines and smokiest casino of all the casinos we went to on the strip!
So yeah...we are Vegas veterans and have stayed at nearly every property on the strip...and when we had a comp offer for Bally's I admit that we were a bit "oh well" with expectations...and will also be the first to admit that this stay was outstanding!. . We booked a room in the newly renovated Jubilee Tower.  Check in was smooth and painless and we quickly found our way to the elevators.  NOTE:  We stayed before and had to walk on past the front desk, through the casino and back to the rear tower elevators...the Jubilee towers are in the front, meaning the elevators are just to the right of the front doors when you walk in, SUPER convenient.. . Upon entering the room we were shocked with a TON of space, a nice king bed, huge HDTV, 2 lounge chair things (sorry, not a decor kind of person), nice open fridge, separate sink serving as a 'kitchenette', huge bathroom which included a nice sitting area for doing the whole make up thing (with make up mirror), and big shower with big sized shower head...and...a full view of the Eiffel Tower and partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  On top of everything else...it was super clean!. . I'd say the only drawback to staying in the Jubilee tower is the fact that if you go to the pool, you have to walk through the ENTIRE casino to get to the stairs, which take you down past the shops and food court to get to the pool.  Fine for us guys but if you are female, make sure you take a cover up or you might feel a bit awkward.. . As far as the casino itself, the table minimums are great (we had $5 minimums our whole stay), the drink service was spot on, the dealers were very nice and the overall vibe was awesome.  Couple that with a great location on the strip (right in the middle) and you really have a fantastic place to stay.. . Yes, you can get a 900 sq. ft. suite with sunken couch, but do you really need it?  If you are looking for a super clean and comfortable place to stay that is centrally located on the strip..I'd definitely recommend Bally's.

It was great. . The room. . The service. .I really enjoyed myself here. .everyone was attentive. . Only drawback was the amount of people trying to sell you discount tickets with a catch. . Other than that. . Great stay. .
Great experience! Clean room and WOW huge! Housekeeper was fantastic!  No problems whatsoever! . . We loved the Tequila Bar! Bartenders were super friendly and fast! And you couldn't beat the $2 Tacos and Margaritas!
No comps or upgrade offered, even after I mentioned I was going to play at their property. The room was nice, and clean, but my view was Flamingo ave and not the strip as I excepted.. The front desk people were not very helpful in reducing my rates even after I gambled allot w/the TR card. Downtown seemed to have better deals, and also on food. If you are expecting your expectations to be exceeded this is not the place for you.
