We stayed here 3 nights. And considering the very low  rate, this was a nice hotel.  Some people say it looks dated. Duh. It's supposed to look like Egyptian times.  Now, the place IS a bit worn, but I have to consider the rate.  Our room was a king in the east tower.  I was told by the desk that those rooms were in newer condition.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the pillows were nice. The bathroom was clean, not worn and hot water was instant.  Only downside was in room coffee, but I'm sure the want you to head downstairs to buy it, and no in room WiFi.  My 4G service on my phone worked good enough.  If you need WiFi, just head downstairs and hang out in one of the food court areas or Starbucks. After all is said, I would stay here again in a minute.  Also, watch out when you are looking at rates.  The hotel, as most in Vegas, adds a $20/day resort fee.
It was all going great! The wait at valet parking was short, bellman was so nice and welcoming and then the front desk agent happened. Ayyyy!. . For starters, how are you going to give us a double/double when clearly we need a King. Oooooh .... you're oversold. Fine, fine ... please provide me a room key so I can shower! That's when it really gets funky! The bathroom was clean, properly stocked with toiletries; however, challenges were immediately encountered with the plumbing in the shower and with the shower head. The water was not draining properly - we were forced to shower with the backed-up water around our ankles - and the shower head had no pressure. A front desk associate was advised of the problem and an engineer was promptly dispatched. . . Unfortunately, during the unclogging process, our room became permeated with the smell of sewage, which forced us to leave the room for several hours. A HUGE setback in our plans for the evening. The following day, a similar situation occurred, but with the bathtub. The water drained so slowly, that when we returned from our evening out the water had still not completely drained.. . It would have been ideal if the front desk associate would have been open to accommodating the room change request. We would have been in favor of moving to another double/double. However, the front desk associate indicated that for this request to be accommodated, the plumbing issue would have to be irreparable, and also required additional management approval. Not exactly what an exhausted traveler in need of a shower wants to hear (*sigh*).. . Also, the line at Starbucks was always far too long. If you know your morning flow, put extra staff on. It's just common sense people! The concierge staff wasn't the best, but at least they tried to assist. . . I think I see the SLS in my future!
I have nothing but good things to say about  my stay at the Luxor.  From the wonderful check in experience to the check out in the end, everything was just right.  A friend told me to ask for an room upgrade with a spa tub.  That was the best $35 extra I had ever paid.  The only bad thing was that the Jacuzzi jets had been turned off and all we had was a large tub in the main room.  This addition made our stay oh so very memorable.  The pool and spa in the back also were quite nice.  I am certainly a fan of the Luxor.  You should try this place too.
We received free upgraid to the tower suite! That was really awesome stay. The suite was huge, with jacuzzi. . Staff is friendly and always ready to help.. Casino is decent.. Buffet is one of the best we've been to.
This time it was better stay . However , we had asked upon reservation for a cot . It was not in our notes to have one. After returning from a night out it still wasn't there. So at 1 am we had call again for it. It finally arrived sometime between 1:30 am and 4:00 am. We were out.. The toilet runs all day long. Annoying to listen to. . There are no full length mirrors. . Late check out is 12:00 or they charge $85 til 3:00 pm. . But, the staff was nice and no plumbing problems this time.
My wife and I came to Las Vegas to see a Country & Western concert across the street from the Luxor.  The Luxor is big. It is easy to find.  When we arrived finding the "right" place to drop off the car took a little time to locate.  The staff coming in was very nice and professional. However, the man who checked us in gave us no information, and he kept using the term "guys"  "You guys".  I am a university professor/grandfather and my wife is a physician.  Being referred to as "you guys" was inappropriate and unacceptable. . . They upgraded us to a "better" room.  When we got to the room, we wondered what we were upgraded from, because the room was clean, neat, yet small.  . . The room was a surprise.  There was NO coffee pot nor courtesy bottled water in the room.  There was no refrigerator.  There were no pay-per-view movies.  We couldn't find a list of hotel services and locations.  We couldn't find a menu for room service.  After three days, we are still unsure if they have room service.  We looked it up on the Internet and in fact, they do have room service, but you wouldn't know it if you just checked out the room.. . The Casino is huge, but there are few places to eat, and most have very limited hours.  On Saturday, we got back and couldn't find an open restaurant.  We asked one of the security guards at midnight who told us it was the Deli and a McDonalds.  After roaming for awhile we found a group of restaurants open until one outside the hotel..  . . The Luxor did a great job getting us to the venue.  There was a shuttle going across the street.  We tried to get information about the tickets and we were given different information.. . There is no desk in the room.  It is not expensive to stay here, but the lack of amenities and being forced out of our rooms to get any services seemed like we are being encouraged to gamble.  There was no entertainment, no music in the hotel, and my wife and I don't gamble.  I guess we are not the Luxor "appropriate" guests.
Stayed three nights on October 2014,great customer service,Steve helped us when we checked in,he was really nice and helpful,got my mlife card that you can use to get a lot of discounts and make points to get even more rewards...room was clean and nice,they have a great selection of food places and their buffet its the best,they have sat and sun unlimited mimosas during brunch,i highly recommend the Luxor!
Luxor is a mediocre hotel. You get what you pay for. The price might almost be reasonable if it wasn't for resort fees. Registration took forever but the room was okay. Nothing fancy. I had one major problem with the hotel that dropped it a star which is that I have the most uneasy vibe staying there. I had terrible nightmares, felt on multiple occasions that someone or something was crawling towards me in the bed, and in the morning there was blood on my pillow and sheets that hadn't been there before. Now perhaps I just had a bad feeling and this was all just a weird coincidence but I don't think I will ever stay here again. I was in room 4044 btw.
The hotel is massive, many restaurants, great rooms, great pool area. The morning chef at the backstage deli, unfortunately i didn't catch his name.. but he is amazing, always happy and such a kind person, loved going down there for breakfast. . The hotel is in a good location and an easy walk to the other hotels.. i love that during the day you can walk through the many joined hotel/casinos to stay out of the heat, but its a lovely walk at night down the strip.. . Once arriving back in Australia i had realised i had left my brand new never worn $100 jacket in the wardrobe of the room. Of course i contacted the Luxor regarding the recovery of the jacket and all i got in return were emails forwarded between staff members, never a direct email to myself, of course until i put a review on tripadvisor, to which in response i got "Please reach out to us directly at guestrelations@luxor.com so we can ensure this matter is handled appropriately. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we hope to have the chance to serve you again in the future.". Contacted them directly again and had no response until i emailed them AGAIN two weeks later, this time all i got was that nothing had been found in my room. . I will never stay here again. My best friend who traveled with me is a travel agent here in Australia and she will no longer recommend the Luxor to any of her customers so they have lost a lot of business! I work in a hotel myself and know exactly what this industry is like and all i can say is this is absolutely disgusting service and i have never been treated so poorly in my life!
Stayed here on my honeymoon & it didn't disappoint! Our suite was amazing and a had great view of the strip in both rooms. There was a soaking tub right next to the window which was amazing and a flat screen TV in both rooms. The king sized bed was so luxurious and the pillows were so soft. The bathroom was really big and the shower worked great. . The price was amazing especially for a suite and at check in they gave you a booklet with tons of coupons for shows drinks and food.. The hotel had so much to do along with the casino. There were 4 different shows located in the Luxor. Which was great because while my hubby was playing in the casino I went to the Titanic & bodies exhibitions since I wasn't 21. . The Luxor was also conveniently connected to the Excalibur and the Mandalay Bay shops.. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning for my 21st birthday!!
Ugh! Quick Hit machine malfunctioned and waited for 10 minutes before I had to look for someone to help me.  Fancy hotel but the services doesn't match the exterior/interior.
We had four rooms. And stayed in the west tower. One suite and 3 regular rooms. Rooms were nice. Suite was excellent. . Hotel staff was very accommodating. . We got married there. If there was a storage review for the chapel we would give it 5 stars. Chapel staff was awesome.
I loved how we were right by all the places we wanted to go to every night.  Everything was walking distance.  It was so convenient to just walk over and not wait forever in a taxi line.. . The room was decent.  It didn't look run down like some of the other places I've stayed at.  It had a nice shower.  The only thing negative about this room was that the door knob was coming off; it was loose.  The house-keeping worker was awesome.  She was persistent to clean our room, but of course she was trying to work for a tip. lol. . For those who don't know, you must have a room key to self-park.  So you must park in the 15 min parking to get your key upon first arrival at the hotel for check-in.  This would suck if the line is really long.  This makes it very inconvenient if you're rushing to go somewhere especially when you arrive late.  That's what happened to us!
Stayed here for the weekend. Last time I stayed here was twenty years ago. . This time the novel "Inclinator"ride was rough and rattling. . In my room the Curtain did not shut tighy so the morning sun ray woke me up earlier than I hoped for.. . My bad but my miff is when I locked my self out of the room and had to wait thirty minutes for the security personnel to meet me in front of my room to let me in!  . . Where there is so much competition as in Las Vegas,  this establishment needs some upgrade work to do.  Otherwise I will try a different hotel on my next trip to LV.
Stayed here on a conference rate of $90 per night in the East Tower...All was very acceptable including the quality of the room, food, service, and all the ammenities...the spa and pool were excellent, and the mezz level had easy access to shopping and other restaurant choices...the Egyptian theme in the Luxor surpasses many other casinos that are trying to convey a themed environment....many of the bad reviews appear to be written by folks that only write when they want to complain, or feel a need to trash the entire venue because their bread was delivered late...For top level experience at a bargain basement price, I recommend the Luxor
If I were only rating the casino portion of the Luxor, I would give it 4 stars. The tables were always full, with a pretty good crowd and professional dealers. Also, I won a lot of money at the tables so that always makes it a more enjoyable experience. Play at one of the two craps tables and find the one Patrick is working. He will take care of you. I would take a star off due to the smoke. I can not believe you can still smoke anywhere. It's gross. . The hotel rooms were pretty poor. Unfortunately I was here for 4 nights for a conference last week. I stayed in the East tower, for reference. How in the world is there a hotel that does not offer wireless? They have an ethernet cable you can connect to, but there is no desk or table, so you have to stretch the cable onto your bed. Even when it is plugged in, it was so loose it kept falling out. Even if I was not there for business I would be disappointed. My room did smell, all the time. There were a couple of dead bugs, maybe moths, in the drawers so I obviously had to keep everything in my bag. . Overall, just average. I would stay elsewhere if I had to pick, not my company. Too bad it doesn't matter because it is the strip and people will always stay here.
There is one main reason I absolutely adore this place. I am hugely obsessed with Egypt and Egyptian culture. I love the decor and architecture that resembles an actual pyramid. Inside of this pyramid is what is considered the grand view of hotel rooms shaped into what many embassy suite hotels look like inside. Everything from the hieroglyphics, sphinx and tombs collectively creates an atmosphere beyond Vegas. During a stay in the UK I planned to visit Egypt but because of war my flight was refunded. Until I am able to visit Cairo and tour Egypt I'll enjoy this for now. I can go on about this place but unfortunately it doesn't include gambling because I don't partake.
I LOVE the Mlife resorts.  I ONLY stay at the MGM resorts international because we always get great service and rewards.   From the check in to our check out we were treated really well and we enjoy our trips to Las Vegas!  I do recommend staying in the remodeled towers and not the pyramid itself. If you are looking for more of a modern style suite.. stay in the towers.   Other than that   drink, gamble and have fun!
Stay was ok until our last day when we were getting ready to check out. One word.....'bedbug'....we were shocked to have discovered one crawling on our bed. After the initial reaction of flicking it off the bed, we realized we should retain the bug and report to the hotel staff. After waiting for what seemed to be forever for the receptionist to answer the call to report our findings, they finally answered then sent security up to our room. Again waiting for what seemed to be forever. The security came, we gave him the bed bug for evidence. By this time the bug was seeping blood from probably being flicked off the bed w/ his belly full of human blood. (We know it was a bed bug!) No report was filed because we could not verify that one of us had been bitten. However it seemed pretty obvious considering the blood coming from the bug. In any event we were told to simply get our clothing cleaned and send Luxor the bill. Security left. After thinking about this further we decided to go downstairs to report because we didn't want to send a bill in for the cleaning and them not having anything on record. We went downstairs, took forever to get the manager over. Basically they offered to take ALL our clothing and clean it themselves then 'ship' us the clothing. Seriously? by this time we had already loaded the luggage into our car. Now the car could possibly be infected? not to mention we would be w/out our clothing for like 2 wks. They refused to discount the room and they also seemed to be unconcerned about the incident. It was not taken seriously. Basically they were to shut the room down for the next customer and take our clothes and inspect the room for 'possible' infestation. They said the would call regarding their finding. The fact that we gave the bug to the security appeared to be irrelevant. The bug was the 'evidence' in our opinion. But that didn't mean much to them. . . Basically I don't feel they took the situation seriously. They didn't care about the car, the luggage or anything else we had brought, except for the cleaning of our clothing. So what would happen if the luggage was infected or anything else was exposed. Cleaning the clothes seemed like only a small portion of what could have possibly been exposed. . . Our main reason for reporting this, was to report the incident and not have the next customer exposed to this situation. Having us exposed to this bed bug or many more was completely disgusting and made our departure a disappointment. . . We are left w/ cleaning our car, our luggage and our laundry thoroughly, ourselves. A complete inconvenience.. . On top of it, they NEVER called us to advised if they found an infestation.  Whether or not they found one, there was absolutely positivity a BEDBUG in our bed.  There lack of not calling us after they said they would shows they DON'T care.   . . Will never stay here again.
Here's an interesting comparison:. Wife & I had a business conference in Las Vegas, decided to also spend a few days at one of our favorite natural earth wonders, Zion National Park, about 3 hours from Vegas. . . The hotel in the tiny Zion Park town of Springdale honored our reservation for a king-bed room, which included a fridge, coffee/tea/hotpot, a full room service menu, an ample complimentary breakfast each morning, and full wi-fi. There's about 15 brand-name and mom-&-pop hotels in the little town outside the park, and all of them offer the same.. . After 3 days in Zion, checked into the Luxor, a name raising expectations of something "deluxe," on the ultra-modern, high-end-deluxe-hotels Las Vegas Strip. Not so much.... . Oversold, can't give us the king room we reserved, gotta take queen instead. OK. Fridge in room? Nah. Coffee/tea/hotpot? Nope. Comp breakfast? Whadya think this is, the Ritz? . . How 'bout in-room Wi-Fi, gotta have Wi-Fi? . . Er, nope. We've got a long Ethernet cable for hardwire connection, but that's useless for our iPads. Wait...what century is this? A marquee hotel on the ultra-modern Las Vegas Strip, with every kind of digital & neon connection available - hell, even the Luxor pyramid lights up in sequence at night - and no Wi-Fi in the rooms?! "Well we have Wi-Fi in the public areas, down at the casinos & restaurants." Ahh, there's the tip off.... . As confirmed by my wife and several other Vegas-savvy people (I'm a little slow about corporate manipulation,) the reason they don't have any of these basic in-room amenities is because THEY DONT WANT YOU TO STAY IN YOUR ROOM. Not even for a half-hour, enjoying a hot teas while researching tonight's restaurant on the Web. They want you downstairs, gambling and buying your coffee or tea at one of the 6 Starbucks. Pure corporate manipulation put before comfort first.. . There have been close to 2000 reviews over many years for this place, and they can never raise above 2-1/2 stars. You get the distinct impression they've done nothing to spruce up the place or invest in better pay for their employees or basic amenities for the rooms. And, talking to the staff, you get the feeling they really don't give a toss, because they know the hotel will stay constantly booked anyway, whether they upgrade or not. Vegas don't care 'bout you, just your wallet.
It had been some time since I stayed here and I must say the service has improved.. . Check in was quick, I had a reservation and I was off to my room.. . In town for a meeting and training, I got to my room within 10 minutes upon arrival.. . My rental car was parked to the rear and security was visible.. . For $62 total, a great room and customer service, I plan to stay here in the future.. . Thanks Luxor !!!
I am giving this place 5 stars because I got more than I was expecting and was pleasantly suprised! I read a lot of bad reviews. I stayed here anyway because this is where the conference was that I was going for. My room was way nicer than described by others. It was in the west tower, 19th floor. Huge tub, marble looking floors, great view, cozy bed. The food the hotel provided at the conference was VERY good! Their desserts were AMAZING! The only complaint I have was the hotel was so cold, my room a/c was on super cold when I arrived and it took it like a day to warm up, probably cuz of the marble floors. I am normally not a cold person either. Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to stay here again, and I'll request the west tower.
This hotel was pretty, clean and the m life desk people are awesome with customers service. But it has some downfalls.. . One the jacuzzi is closed by 6pm! We want to go out have fun then take a dip and go to bed. You sleep way better after a dip in the jacuzzi but that's not going to happen here.. . Two I had no idea I was a M life member they could of told me at check in. . . Three we got our room and it had 2 queens beds so we called down to the front desk 1st person said all king beds were taken the second time we called oh they had king bed available. What happened in the two seconds between calls you may ask? Well the king bed are in the towers not the pyramid. The second person was nice enough to think about giving us all our options. . . Four the bell desk will come up and pick your laundry up but when it's done you have to go get it. . . Overall it wasn't a nice place to stay.
A little too pricy, but the rooms are nice and clean. The staff is pretty friendly. Except for super annoying people offering discounted  tickets for a "two hour" timeshare presentation, which turns into 5 hours at least
Stayed at the Luxor last weekend i stayed their for 3 nights & 2 days in the west tower 6th floor pay about 500$. Got to say i was impress with the room & the casino service everything is on point, I read the reviews here in yelp and i read a bunch of negativity on this casino but i still gave it a shot and i'm satisfy i can neatly say i'll be back. LoL. House keeping is on point the concierge is on point the employees at the pool are very attentive to your needs! and the Egyptian feeling you get staying here where the units are like mazes are pretty dope!  #yougetwhatyoupay4
Stayed here on my most recent Vegas trip and loved it. It's affordable and while it does have a gimmicky feel, it still feels chic unlike some of the other themed hotel-casinos on the strip. The pyramid gives the room a unique and spacious feel, and while a couple of pieces in the room are in need of updating overall it feels modern and clean. Had no issues with the staff, check-in, wifi, and enjoyed the nice flatscreen TV in the room. Would stay here again!. . PS- play myVegas on Facebook for access to cheaper rooms. After just a few hours I was able to get the weekend rate to $65. Do it, and embrace the MLife!
This was my place of stay while I was in Vegas. Hotel is located at beginning of strip and is connected to Excalibur and Mandalay bay. Beautiful on the inside (lobby area is one of the better looking on the strip) and they do have great people serving you. Rooms are a good price and a nice size. They have everything you need in here (pool parties, food court, restaurants, lax nightclub and so much more). Also if you stay at the hotel, they do give you a huge coupon book for savings and free entry/thing to different stuff. The thing I love most here is the Egyptian theme that the hotel has. A good place to stay in Vegas and one of the more affordable ones.
Stayed 1 night. The check-in process was quick process but charged $20 for early check-in.  . We sent to elevator B when it should have been A. We asked to stay on same floor with our friends & was told it would be $40 so employee placed us on the floor below our friends. Employee told  us would be next to the elevator to meet our friends.  Room was not near any elevators. Room has no reception for cell phone.. Luxor is ok.
pros - great staff, hotel is clean. . cons - beds were god awful, those mattresses should have been retired 20 years ago, on, wasnt even fit to lay on. . no coffee pot, really not even a $5 brewer. . the used car salesmen pushing " comp" tickets, which really means you pay, and they are persistent, I would stay at circu circu before here again
We stayed in the pyramid. It is a novelty thing. The slanted windows make the rooms a bit different.  The windows are black and absorb heat. The AC works very hard. The AC will be constantly running. Our friends had the honeymoon suite. Even with two AC units, the room was barely cool. I would suggest the towers.. The pool is nice. We used one of the cabanas for a more private pool. ALL of the pools are only 3 feet deep. You will be walking around on your knees all day. . The location of the hotel is great but the shallow pool is a deal breaker.
I typically either stay at the Venetian/ Palazzo or the MGM Grand. Time does indeed fly as when I try to park my car at the North valet, it had been closed for years and was just used for limousines!. . I was thrilled to see that despite the renovations to the casino area and common areas, that I had left the good stuff like the fabulous art intact, but added a plethora of new dining options and many exciting bars and clubs. I also appreciate the fact only Luxor is proudly LGBT friendly, and even host a swim party during the summer months.. . My room in the tony East tower was so comfortable, modern and inviting.....that I spent most of my time during the day in it! but then again I had to work remotely during the day. I was thrilled to find out that the room had a wired internet connection. not only was this vastly faster than wireless, it was safer and even faster than my connection at work!. . The furnishings in the room more outstanding and in pristine and like new condition. And so very clean! I fell in love with the comfortable bed and crisp clean white linens!. . Service is what makes or breaks any business, and this is where Luxor totally trumps the Las Vegas Sands properties and by now second favorite MGM Grand. every possible interaction with a staff member what a pleasure. and if you needed anything special it was delivered in less than 5 minutes. Amazing!. . What are remembered very quickly after not visiting in about 6 years, was how quickly and easy it was to get to your room. because of the layout of the east and west towers, you are never further than  ten doors from your room. and the tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur always ran on time and was such a convenience when visiting other MGM properties.. . Lastly, I wanted to thank the MGM Grand Corporation for the impressive payouts are received on the slot machines. winning $1,000 made me do a happy dance!. . I am already planning my next visit to Luxor!
STAY AWAY FROM #4147. . . In my 15 years of travel for work/pleasure I have never had to change a hotel room due to it being haunted-until last week. Luxor room 4147 has some bad juju going on. It was dark and heavy and felt like someone committed suicide in that room a few days before my arrival. At night my bed would be nudged and I would hear my cologne bottle and other toiletries being moved around in the bathroom. Also I heard what sounded like plastic bags being dropped all around my room during the night. Very strange and unsettling. When the Luxor gave me a new room it was a night/day difference. The lady "Kitty" at the front desk was understanding to my situation and seemed to have heard about this problem room before. Stay away from 4147.
First time here, I find a used condom on the floor, bodily fluids, could be hiv aids ebola, disgusting! Two managers felt that it wasn't a big deal, and manager Emily says, "you only found one?" What?! How many condoms do you have to find to ask for a new room! Wow, way to take care of your issues.
Pretty big hotel and friendly staff.... You can tell this place is very old by the look of the door and tiles in the bathroom... Standard rooms are nice... Nothing special..... Good place for the price
First time to vegas.. A little disappointed with my first time staying in the Luxor. Check in took about 45 minutes, only 2 employees for about 15+ people in line..   Our room was below mediocre with lots of issues. I tried to get our room AC unit fixed 2 times and finally gave up.. I had to speak with someone about changing our room. The Upgraded room in the tower was much nicer. The pool area seemed to always be dirtied with cigarette butts everywhere, every morning. Don't think I would stay here again.
Stayed here in a bind...crappy pool, crappy dining, boring view...plus side nice bathroom...overall I'd rather stay at The Quad which is a dump but in the middle of EVERYTHING!!!!!!
Stayed here in a double queen room on 8th floor over looking good court. While quiet at night certainly nothing spectacular to look at inside or outside the hotel. After all one goes to Vegas for fun outside the hotel room but it would have be nice to have a cool view of the city day or night. . . All in all it was an OK experience. There are few dining choices at the Luxor. If you walk past the food court and into Mandalay Bay there are several more dining choices that probably meet your needs not yo mention sports bars. . . Internet service is non existent in the room while in public spaces a bit better but sluggish. I found when at other hotels or casinos internet speed was normal. I as well as my friends using Sprint and Verizon had terrible cell phone call quality with missed and dropped calls in the room. . . Would I return and stay here again, 50-50. There are other hotels with similar pricing and better amenities that would be on my radar.
Came her mainly to see Criss Angel, his show was amazing! He gets four stars. Upon checking into the room I felt gross, & came across two used Q-tips...the table had smudges on it. I called the FD & they apologized & moved me immediately. The new room was much better felt a lot cleaner. The structures & shape of the building are beautiful, however I think the rooms really  need an update, also there was no complementary water & there was no wifi... only Dial up!?  Also we our last night we were dying of dehydration & I called the room service & a Large bottle of Aquafina was $14 are F****** kidding me...we drank tap water with ice...lol....
