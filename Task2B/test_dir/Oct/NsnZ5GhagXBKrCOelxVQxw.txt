This really was as good as it gets.  Stayed at the Hotel and this was the first place we ate only because there were two empty seats at the bar.. . Although I'm not into sushi there were other menu items to choose from.. . We found a shell in the salad and they not only comped the salad, but also offered a complementary entree and dessert.  Both were delicious!. . The place is very trendy and definitely not cheap.
I cannot say enough amazing things about this place! Went here over a year ago the night we got married. The service was fabulous... the food was just as fabulous... our bartender (Mari) was so cute and sweet and really genuinely excited to have served us on the night we got married. On our anniversary, a year later... we went back here and lucky us, Mari was working.. She remember us and gave us the same fantastic service. The manager came over to greet us and thank us for coming back and he even brought us an amazing appetizer on the house (not sure of the name on the appetizer but it was some scallop dish presented on half shells -- AMAZING)... they did this on our first visit as well... Mari gave us two amazing drinks on the house as well. The food here is literally the BEST sushi I have ever had.... the service cannot be beat..and a great ambiance!. . My husband and I absolutely love this place and we have made a standing date at this place every year for our anniversary. I will not visit Vegas and skip a visit to this place! Can't wait to go back! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could...
The sushi here is always so good I am yet to try adish I don't like!
Don't order takeout. . . I usually love SushiSamba and make a point to eat there every time I go to Vegas. This time, I was extremely disappointed.. . I ordered 2 Rio Grandes to go since I had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the Rio Grande. Unfortunately, part of my order was missing, even after I questioned it.. . On the bill, the Rio Grande was listed as Gaucho, so I asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. Since I usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, I didn't question it. The Rio Grande is 45 dollars on the menu, so I expected to be charged 90 for both. However, for those two items, it was listed as $114. I also ordered 2 sides. . . I didn't bring it up because I usually love SushiSamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. I also ordered a cocktail and the Wagyu appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. On top of this, I included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after I was reassured that my order was correct. I didn't have time to look through the bag because I needed to catch a flight, but once I got to the airport, I found out that the Chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the Rio Grande comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the Picanha, the two sides I ordered.. . You can imagine my frustration. When I takeout from a restaurant, especially one that I frequent, I expect my order to be correct. I honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.. . I would give 1 star for this experience. The extra star is because I usually do have a positive experience (with Philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).. . I don't think I will come back here ever again. Something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.
I just love this place. First off it has a great upbeat atmosphere dj will get up there and start spinning and you feel like you are in the scene for the night.  Then the food is just savory goodness. Whoever actually came up with the concept to mix Brazilian Peruvian and Japanese cuisine and out together a menu like this deserves a reward for the betterment of mankind. As you can tell I'm a little high in this place. Also have to admit a wonderful cocktail menu. There ceviche is just heavenly.
OMG... The food is amazing.  Great selection.   Fresh sushi and the service and chef selections were fantastic.. . Fusion of brazil and Japanese was unique and definitely a delight.  Can't give enough kudos to the chef and the restaurant as a whole.  . . I would definitely come back and let the server choose what to serve us.
Awesome food that is fusion of Brazil Japan and peru. Wife has Chilean sea bass. Pretty cheap plate under $30 at sushi samba. Not bad but not the best Chilean sea bass. I have better at other restautant.. . I had a cut roll that was only three pieces but we'll worth the money. The cut roll has tuna, foie gras,  caviar, and gold flake!! Believe it was $20. I couldn't tell the difference but I ordered it for the heck of it.. . Peruvian corn which are big and pulpy. Quite different taste.. . As for atmosphere, awesome place to hang out and have a cocktail while meeting eye candy lady in a loud atmosphere with a DJ. If you are into it.
Cost $500 every time came here to have yummy sashimi, but the last time really sucks! One oyster stink n wholly smell. Was of my favorite but won't go there again
If you are coming to Vegas, fine dine yourself at SUSHISAMBA. It's an absolute must as there was definitely a samba, fiesta, and crazy epic party in my mouth happening. . . I came here for weekday lunch with two friends and it's quite empty BUT DON'T LET THAT DETER YOU FROM EATING HERE AT ALL! Do make a reservation just in case! . . The unique ambiance that makes the restaurant look deceptively larger than it is has cozy booths to sit in as we deciphered which choices on the menu to select (because unfortunately we couldn't have everything... even though we literally wanted EVERYTHING).. . Order everything I state here. For real. . JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA (ALL GYOZA SHOULD BE THIS INTERESTINGLY GYOZAWESOME). TUNA TATAKI (BEST BITES OF TUNA I'VE EVER HAD). BLUE POINT OYSTERS (MAXIMIZE THE APHRODISIACS WHILE YOU ARE IN VEGAS). DUCK BREAST (CAN I GET A QUACK QUACK?!). DESSERT... GET THE BANANA SPLIT (THEIR DECONSTRUCTED VERSION IS EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED). . . I can't wait to try their location in NYC, but for now I'll reminisce the Peruvian-Brazilian-Japanese Vegas food day club party version of Wet Republic and Encore combined!
My husband and I are locals in Las Vegas, and have visited many restaurants on the strip. Sushi Samba is one that we had been waiting to try, and it lived up to all of our expectations. From the minute we were seated by the hostess to the end of our dinner, the experience was wonderful. The ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgable about all the food and beverages. Throughout our dinner he took the time to explain all the dishes to us as they came out. My husband had a Sake, and I tried their signature Samba juice, both drinks were very good. We tried a little bit of everything from appetizers to entrees. The food was delicious! The sushi would rate among the best that we ever had. Their menu is a fusion of Brazilian and Japanese, so they had some very different items to choose from that you don't see at other Japanese restaurants. We also had a chance to meet Chef Joel as he walked around the restaurant. He was very personable, and took the time to talk with my husband and I. He explained to us about some of the dishes that were on the menu, and you could see the passion he had for the food. It makes us really excited to go back and try more! The excellent serve we received, the exciting environment, and the delicious food makes for a wonderful experience. This is one restaurant I think should be tried by all that come to Las Vegas!
We went for our 4th year anniversary and it was an amazing experience.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful and the manager came over to congratulate us and to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. I had bought a special cake for the house so when we said no to dessert they brought us a Banana Split on the house! I will definitely be coming back :D
We did the prefixed meal and my husband wanted gluten free and the service was awesome, the food so tasty. They were totally on the GF thing too. So so good.
Went here when I was in Vegas for a conference.  The meal I had here had to be one of the best meals I've ever had.  We had a group of 7 and we all got the chef's selection/omikase.  The food just kept on coming and it was all amazing.  There was this one dish that I still dream about.  It was a king crab leg opened up with some kind of butter sauce within the shell.  IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER TASTED.  I've been to a lot of high end japanese restaurants and this was the first omikase where I was actually happy and satisfied after.  . . Not only was the food great but the service was amazing.  Isaac our server was always on top of trying to keep us happy (and always made sure we had hitachino or sake topped off).  Also, Rannah the manager was amazing as well.  She took to the time throughout our meal to check up on us and make sure we were having an amazing time.  She even offered us recommendations on how to make the most of our time in Vegas.  . . We will definitely now be making Sushi Samba a regular occurence at our annual conferences/trips out to vegas
DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR!! The bartender was a total jerk and made it very clear that he didn't want to help us. The sad thing is that the food was good and when we relocated to the back of the restaurant or experience improved and our waiter was much nicer and helpful.
I'm addicted! !! I love the A5 wagyu goyza!!!!! Omg it's amazing! !!!! Comes with a squash puree.  So delicious! !!! I highly recommend it!! It's my second time this week ordering it!
We had reservations after a show and were seated promptly upon arrival. The chucumber cocktail is fabulous, as were all of our apps and rolls. The salt and pepper squid was incredible! All of the rolls we ordered were fresh and delicious. Service, however, was lacking. Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and totally scattered. It took forever to get the check and pay the bill, and we had to flag him down for everything. He never came by to check on us once. I have been to Sushi Samba in NYC and Miami as well and always had good service. Service fell flat at this location.
This place is just off the charts. We mainly ate ceviche and sashimi, they came with such great creative sauces. Service was outstanding and restaurant manager stopped by couple times to make sure we're doing fine. While I wasn't impressed with tuna (a bit of tuna snob here) I can't take any stars from this review. 5/5. . Btw, drinks are great too. "Nashi" was such a perfectly balanced one.
Food was delicious! Our waitress was right on with all her suggestions.  Good music, ambience, and food.  Also, the manager came out and gave us a special happy anniversary treat! It was such a nice surprise! Sushisamba made our anniversary dinner a special one.
Ok. Nothing special. Portions were small for the price but food was good. I've had better sushi, but I've also had worse. . . Service was good if you like to be checked often. I personally don't, especially when we were obviously having a business conversation. Every 5-10 minutes was "how's everything over here". During a 90 minute dinner, that's a lot of interruptions. You be the judge.
When I say the food & service is amazing here, I truly mean it!. . I had dinner here last night for my birthday with a couple of friends and our minds and tastebuds were blown away. I started my night with a raspberry mojito, it was so refreshing. . . Sat down for dinner and kicked it off with "A MUST HAVE" Waygu beef gyoza, Kobe beef mini tacos, Sawagabi & rock shrimp. . . Sat down for dinner and kicked it off with "A MUST HAVE" . Main corse; Moqueca with mussels, shrimp, clams & squid, 5 meat churrasco & a couple sushi rolls. . . Ended the night with desert. They presented a Happy Birthday written in chocolate on a plate of there fabulous Samba split. Every bite was to die for. . . Make sure you ask for the manager Jason Pietrantoni, amazing customer service. . . Can't wait to eat here again :)
I am soooo happy we found this place. The flavors were fresh, the colors bold, the plating beautiful. Really its a light happy kind of full. We tried the yellowtail sashimi ceviche, the lima samba roll, the sea bass anticuchos, the pork belly robata, and the mango tres leite. SOOOOOO Happy my favorites were the yellowtail ceviche it had a perfect little bite to it, just the right amount of heat and the lima roll was almost like butter in your mouth.
Love, love, love this place. Flawless service, excellent food, and the DJ-rocking atmosphere put Sushisamba at the top of my list for great Las Vegas dining. At first, I was skeptical. Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes? And they all work together? The answer is yes, indeed they do.. . If you're lucky enough to get Jimmy as your server, do follow his recommendations. His were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. Jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. Oh, and did I mention I have a food allergy? Sushisamba didn't even blink. After my Celiac diagnosis three years ago, I thought I had to give up "chef's choice" or prix fixe meals. Not here. While most of our courses were GF, when they weren't the kitchen prepared GF versions especially for me, and I didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. Sushisamba took care of everything.. . And what dishes they were! Start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of Brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. A few of the highlights: the tuna tataki; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated sea bass; and the moqueca mista. The moqueca mista was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice I've ever had. But the star of the evening was the sushi. Served as the final courses, we had two huge platters - one GF, one not - and wow, did they deliver. Hope to make it back here for another fine meal. Viva Las Vegas!
