To me yama sushi is the best ayce and its a lot affordable compared to others ayce I don't mind the wait tried the halibut sushi the happy rainbow and no name you cannot be dissapointed if you love sushi you'll understand what I mean
Love this place! Would give it a 5star if service was a bit better. Usually go here once a month. You can't beat all you can eat sushi for $25. Food quality has always been great. Not once have we had something we didn't like. . . Usually pretty busy. Always packed for lunch and dinner! It can get a bit noisy with all the people.
Delicious all-you-can-eat with lots of choices for $24.  Friendly service, too.
Great food and price for lunch - all you can eat sushi, and the perfect place to meet up with friends!
The best ever sushi ayce in the world :") costumer sever great. . . Whether because of perceived healthfulness, its clean flavor, or just owing to greater availability, raw fish has stayed hot. And Long Island has benefitted from the rush of new restaurants that specialize in it. Sushi may not be as omnipresent as pizza and pasta, but the communities without a place to sample the uncooked taste of the ocean.... . . I love this place foreal
I like this place so much.... . The food is so good and sever have very nice service...number 7 make it in hand roll is the best sushi i never have. . .   . Love this place!

Best sushi restaurant ever!!!!!! Quick service, great Taste...never disappointed...100% Recommended...!!!!!! Friendly STAFF EVER!!!!
A sushi buffet in vegas? As my account reads : sushi buffets are my place of business. So we had to go check it out.. . Most of the things were good. I mean there was basically a sashimi poke, and that was amazing, i forgot what it was called.. . Some baked rolls were sort of ... odd. But all in all, it was good and I would come back.
Love the updated space! Remembered our favorites even tho we haven't been there in 6 months! Brought friends from South America and they were amazed by the quality, taste, atmosphere,  etc. Sushi chefs are so fast it's unbelievable!  . . Loved everything.. already planning our next trip!
This place.... Yes! Go if you like sushi go! Come hungry. The all you can eat is a steal, it includes soup and desert. All the rolls are made quickly and extremely friendly staff.
when I think of all you can eat sushi, I think of compromised quality for more quantity, but at Yama, that is not the case. Delicious fresh fish! Also great service!!!!!. . I ordered mostly nigiri, and then was unsure of which rolls to order so I told the server to pick us a few rolls (because there are so many to choose from !!!) and not to tell me what they were and to just bring them lol....still not sure what they were but everything was sooooo good and I can't wait to go back :). . I don't normally make yelp reviews, but I this Yama definately deserved it! 5 stars
Lots of options for a very reasonable price ($23 for all you can eat), very tasty sushi and great service so would definitely recommend!. . Cons:. - Not on the strip, bit further out . - Interior is basic
Definitely one of the better sushi places in Las Vegas! Came here on a Monday night and was surprised at how many people were there! We opted to sit at the bar which worked out perfectly. All the rolls we tried were super delicious and for $24 a person it was definitely worth it! Will definitely be back soon!
Love this place. About $25/person for AYCE dinner. My favorite is the Japanese Lasagna and the chocolate mochi ice cream.  My boyfriend's favorite is You the Man.  My only complaints are that the service is inconsistent and the tables are too close together - you're practically sitting in your neighbors lap.
Got sick here in sept of 2013, then again in sept 2014. I wont eat here again. I was so sick, I was layed up for SEVEN DAYS. It's always busy here though,  and its a great deal if you like playing Russian Roulette with food poisening.
Very low prices compared to other sushi joints.  The sushi is good, and I enjoy the tea here :)
Best AYCE sushi in town.  I've been coming here for years.  It's very busy now, but with expanded rooms.  Very worth it.
Service is slow. There is a 2 hour limit but it took them 10 minutes to get our drinks 10-15 to get our order every time. They see us but they are just slow to react.  Other ppl were served ahead of us even though we got there before them. Must have been a busy night. The buffet price is worth it rather than ordering individually.  You have to finish all your food or they charge you extra.  The downside is what to do when the fish taste like crap. Can I renegotiate the price? Another thing I don't understand is why some of the sushi were already presoaked in soy sauce. May be it's the chef's style. I'm from out of town and I've had better quality of fish.  I tried all the fish from their menu and I wasn't impressed with any of them even the Uni was a let down. My only recommendation would be the dumplings and the edema me.
This was the perfect lunch after laser tag.  Ayce sushi.  Totally hit the spot, made all my friends happy.  And the waitress was super nice and even recommended us some stuff.  I was reading some of my friends reviews and they said they had bad service, well I'm glad we went anyway cause they were awesome.. . I loved that dessert was included and they had plum wine ice cream :) sweet!  Mochi ice cream :). . Sushi was good, Kama was good, nigiri was solid.  Rolls came in different combinations and most were pretty tasty. No complaints.
I would have given five stars but the service was terrible.  Very slow, it really was not that busy. AYCE is a great deal, the rolls were great. I'm from out of town. I just wish the waiter was a bit more attentive. It's very annoying to get up and ask for more tea and ask to order more. But other than that the food was good. We got the no name roll, one minute man, baby one more time, crazy roll, and man whore.
my favorite sushi place in Vegas! Decor sucks, service is okay.. but none of that matters cause the food is just so amazing and AYCE is great deal!
We go to Yama quite a bit as it close to our office for lunch.  I really like the Spicy Seafood salad, however it seems they have cut the portion size way down.  The server today was not very attentive either.
All you can eat sushi for less than 25 bucks. Their menu is quite large, the food taste great and every server was nice and courteous. Definitely recommend this place to everyone
No oysters in their AYCE Sushi dinner menu! Try the spicy seafood salad.. you can get a half order, you'll like it!
Awesome. Great price for the all you can eat.  The "Man Whore" is a menu item must.
Yama Sushi is a perfect place for all you can eat sushi!  The staff is very friendly and attentive; they are almost too slow sometimes, but that's okay because it allows your food to digest a little.  The sushi always tastes fresh and the ability to order half-orders of rolls is perfect!  The restaurant is small on the inside, but there is rarely a long wait to get seated.  Perfect for dinner with friends or family!
After many, many 30min-1hr long waits at Goyemon, I decided I needed to find a new sushi joint. Thanks Yelp, I LOVED Yama Sushi! . . I give five stars to the types of rolls they had at Yama and not necessarily the quality of fish. The fish in Vegas just doesn't compare to Japan! The rolls, however are another story. Yama has all of the basic rolls, but most of their menu is filled with original rolls with dirty names. The waiter brought us out a plate of the Wet Dream to try while we waited for the rolls weordered; I love when they do that! Also, Wet Dream turned out to be my favorite roll. . . The seaweed salad was good, cucumber salad not so much. The deep fried oysters had too much fry and not enough oyster. A couple of the rolls had too much cream cheese for me. Thumbs up to being able to order THREE DESSERTS (2 ice creams, 1 mochi ice cream). . . Don't let the less than ideal neighborhood and plain exterior of the restaurant scare you away. The interior and sushi make up for it! . . Yama Sushi is my new favorite sushi restaurant!
The specialty rolls are all creative and candy to the eye, the quality of fish less than Mediocre,  But WOW. Just based off customer service this place gets 1 star, The waiter i had was rood, rolled his eyes at me when he gave me the wrong check..  and most of the workers look like they hate working here. Sucks because i live right down the street and would have loved to have made this my new local sushi restaurant. Since i eat sushi at least 1nce a week. But i absolutely refuse to give these people my money.
What happened Yama? Your quality took a nose dive off a cliff into a heap of mediocrity and bad sushi rice. . . I used to love this place and made a point to come here every time I visited Vegas. For  under $30, AYCE sushi rolls is tough to top, and I guess something had to finally give at Yama. The quality truly is noticeably worse and the rolls are now stuffed with a higher rice to fish ratio. To make matters worse, even the sushi rice quality seemed to have declined as both the texture and flavor are subpar. . . On prior visits,I would have given Yama four stars, but based on my most recent visit, I can't give it more than two. Hopefully, they bounce back and I can edit this review later.
