Not more needs to be said about this place.  We had a great lunch.  Schwartz's has a NY deli feel.  Expect to share a table with strangers.  We had a nice conversation with our "lunch neighbors" while we ate.. . On to the food; the smoked meat sandwich is very good.  The pickles and fries are also what you would expect.  Personally, we liked the smaller portion sizes (smaller than a typical New York deli where one order can feed two people).  You couldn't say that the sandwiches were small.  We both left full and happy.
If you haven't been here yet my only advice would be don't judge the place by it's looks, it's awsome! The line was total worth it! The smoked meet plate and dill pickle side are a great lunch option, I'm happy I follwed the advice of the montrealers I've met
First thing i thought of was Catz deli in greenwich village NY. Definitely similar. . Im probably going to be coming back for another one of these. Excellent flavor and texture meat and really good bread....and im pretty sure their fries are cut from potatos in house. Definitely Recommended but be prepared for a line if you want to sit.
Not sure I can improve on the combined wisdom of 771 previous reviewers, so here's the upshot:. . .:. Horrendously long lines. Order from the to-go counter instead, where there's no line and almost always a couple of chairs in the back. Or eat standing up. It's not worth the hassle of waiting for a table.. .:. "Smoked Meat" is really just brisket. It's a little on the salty side, but has excellent flavor. I recommend a medium fat level: the lean ends can be dry but the fatty ends are practically inedible.. .:. Rye bread and spicy mustard: YES. Classic Jewish deli food! Just don't tell the Canadians they didn't invent it. :). .:. Fries: average. A little on the dry side. I'd skip them in the future.. .:. Price: a little high for the quality, but not bad. Worth doing once, if only so people will stop telling you it's a necessary element of your Montreal experience.
I eat smoke meat first time at Schwartz's. I heard that it is very popular restaurant before I come here. It is very delicious food.
Une institution montrealaise, tres vivement conseillee par notre hote locale. Il fallait absolument que nous testions le "meilleur smoked meat sandwich d'Amerique du Nord". (Il parait meme que Celine Dion et son R'ne ont rachete ce mythique comptoir..!). . Quelle aventure culinaire pour 2 petits touristes francais fraichement arrives...!! On se retrouve avec, dans la main, 2 petites tartines de pain blanc coupees en 2, largement garnies de morceaux de viande ressemblant a du rosbif bien gras, le tout assaisonne aux pickles. Apres un bon moment a reflechir par quel bout le prendre (pas du tout evident pour les non-inities...!), on croque. Et la... Il faut aimer !. . Cote prix : environ 9 dollars pour une sacree part de viande. On peut ajouter des frites et une boisson. L'endroit propose aussi une poutine smoked meat. Nous n'avons pas ose... Mais le groupe d'Americains qui nous precedait en avait l'air ravi !
The atmosphere is comparable to the Carnegie Deli in NYC, i.e. tourists, and only tourists, standing in line. But don't let that deter you, because the food is straight-up Katz's in NYC, i.e. fantastic, no-frills meat sandwiches inless-than-fantastic, no-frills surroundings. . . Whatever you do, for God's sake, don't stand in that line. Order from the to-go counter next door, buy a Schwartz's tote bag, and schlep the whole delicious mess across the street, where someone has created a communal terrasse out of a shipping container. . . Eat your meal while listening to the nearby accordion player run through his repertoire of unidentifiable but atmospheric songs, and give him a nice tip when you're done. Bliss.
Good smoked meat sandwich, but can't really understand what all the fuss (and long lines) are all about.  My sandwich (ordered medium) was good, but a bit dry.  Not much different than corned beef sandwiches I'd get elsewhere...good, but not anything special.. . On the other hand, I also got the cold salami sandwich.  That was much better-very moist and flavorful.  . . Overall, not worth the wait--I thought Lester's served a far superior sandwich.
While I know that pretty much anyone who has lived or visited Montreal knows about this place, my review is what you may not know about them.  Having been a long time Plateau resident, I have eaten from here many many times.  Now being a local you would not be caught dead standing in line to eat here, how do you do it, you ask.  Easy eat there at off hours, plan a meal in the evening, (anytime after 5 is just fine usually), late night is even better so maybe plan on a late night snack after say the movies or bar hopping.  Don't eat there, or if you must ask for the counter, the tables are what holds up the works and keeps people lined up for a long time. If you can take it to go, the inside is not all that amazing anyway, so if it is warm out, plan to take your meal out doors, or take it home.  Also if you want to ensure some better service be a good tipper. I have always tipped (yes even for take out), the reception I get there is the best, so dish out a couple of bucks and you will not wait.
I'm usually nervous about tourist hotspots but this is worth it. Deli style, fuss free, their smokes meat sandwich (bread, mustard, and a ton of smoked meat) is delightful. There are long lines, so either take out or go at a later timing (which is what I did). The smoked meat was basically beef - tender, slightly salty, with just the right amount of fat, and very satisfying. . . Service was efficient and well organized. Wouldn't expect more for a no frills deli. Would definitely go back again.
Montreal is a great foodie town, and it has its staples.  French/Quebecois cuisine.  Bagels.  Destination restaurants like Joe Beef.  'Montreal smoked meat' is definitely on that list, though maybe not the first one that an out-of-towner like myself thinks of.  Once you get past that part and hear that this is a must-have, chances are Schwartz's will be the main place you hear about.. . Schwartz's and the locals know that this place is popular.  The day before we visited while buying bagels at St-Viateur (another name you'll surely hear being held in high regard), the other patrons were raving about the length of the "lineups" in front of Schwartz's.  Schwartz's also realizes this, and in turn operates both a sit-down and carry-out side of their business, a major plus for moving the crowds through quickly.. . The beef itself...pretty good.  If you're familiar with the corned beef, this has similar consistency, utilizing the same brine-curing process, but is actually kosher-style beef brisket.  Throw a bit of mustard on that and put it between 2 slices of bread, and that's all you need!  The amount of hype may have knocked it down a star, but if you go, you won't be disappointed.  Just remember to grab napkins on your way out...this is by no means the tidiest sandwich you'll ever eat.
How can you not be a fan?. . It's an institution.. . Only complaint is sometime out of items from menu like poutine gravy... but if that is the worst thing in your life... you need to goto haiti for awhile
This is my second time here. I came here years ago and the sandwich was fantastic. This time, I came here later in the evening (9 am) and I felt like my sandwich was super dry. Oh well. I'll have to come back a third time to figure it out.
Don't understand the hype. There are better places to get smoked meat in MTL...such a tourist trap.
Delicious (but a little messy - I think the bread was not quite hearty enough to hold up to all the juicy meat filling). I had a smoked meat sandwich and a pickle. Simple, good food. . . I second the recommendation to skip the line for a table and order from the to-go side next door.
They know how to cook great meat, but not how to serve it. Humble interior, C+ service. Up the ante guys!
This is Montreal's equivalent of a New York deli, attitude and all.  Always busy, so expect a wait, but the line moves fast. You can order what you want, but almost everyone is talked into #3, the smoked meat sandwich (basically corned beef).  Piled high and very tasty, you have a choice of lean, medium or on the fatty side (About $8. Canadian). We ordered cole slaw as well which was also good, and the waiter talked us into a veggie which is how he described their pickles. Owned by singer Celine Dion and her husband, this is a very very casual place. We found it a fun experience.
Schwartz's is the original and still the best smoked meat place, at least that I've tried. However, the Main across the street is almost as good, a bit cheaper, and has a better selection. No lineup to get in, either.. . That's not meant to be too much of a dig at Schwartz's, which has always narrowly avoided being a real tourist trap. They could go the Katz's (NYC) route and charge $15 for a basic sandwich. But they don't, which is not to be underestimated.. . I'd suggest getting it for takeout (the door on the left)--the line is shorter, there are still a few tables in that part of the restaurant, and the service on the right side (where the lineups are), while fine, isn't anything special enough to be worth the extra wait.
They rival NYC's famous Katz Deli. I sat on the counter with a friend and we ordered their smoked meat sandwich on rye, and shared fries and a pickle. The meat is tender, moist, and extremely flavorful. Their smoked meat is like this review: simple, no frills, and no fuss. I liked it and I'm sure you will, too.  Since I'm not a local, I said I would visit Schwartz's at least once when visiting Montreal. It's like a NYC tourist visiting Katz' deli at least once on their visit: why not.  When on vacation, I don't usually remember the price of my meals because living in NYC, most things are pretty expensive already (Katz' sandwich is $15-$17 for one! Geez).. . There was a line out the door. The interior is busy (not cozy), but counter staff is friendly.
So over-hyped and I didn't enjoy the food. Think I'll try the Main next time...
This review is for the restaurant not the smash hit musical!. . This is the real deal.  Best smoked meat sandwich I've ever had.  Friendly server and old school charm.  Worth the wait!
The smoked meat is incredible. Why else would people line up in the rain.  I recommend fries, slaw, a pickle, and a coke. A lot of people have the cherry coke but it's not my bag. The stack of meat isn't bad, but it pales compared to the mountain of meat at some of my nyc favs. A bit more meat and five stars for sure. I also went next door to buy some meat to go.
