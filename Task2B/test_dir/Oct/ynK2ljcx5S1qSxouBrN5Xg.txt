Very pleasant stay at the Stratosphere. We showed up and there was a bag of towels in our room that were dirty and the sink wouldnt drain... BUT we called to tell them and the instantly upgraded our room to the new tower. It was modern and lovely next time i go i will absolutley rent a tower room... its worth the extra. Happy we got it comp'd but next time i will pay the difference. Staff was friendly. ROXY's was yummy and quick. the hotel all around was a great experience
Not sure about all the negative reviews. We had a good experience. We stayed at the Stratosphere because we were eloping and the location was convenient the Neon Museum, where we were having our ceremony. Yes you walk into the lobby, which is full of slot machines and people smoking cigarettes. But our stay was fine. Our room, 6203, was in a non smoking section. The room was clean and bed was very comfortable and quiet. The electric went out one night in our bathroom, but the staff took care of it right after we called. We also need additional hangers, which were brought upstairs immediately. There is no fridge, microwave or coffee maker, but we ended up not really having a need for any of those.. Because of our schedule, we ended up having breakfast daily at the hotel (Roxys Diner...where you can get the normal breakfast even yoghurt, granola and berries) and a nighttime draft beer at McCall's Heartland Grill (salad with steak was very good). Everyone at the hotel was helpful & pleasant. . Definitely check out the top floors (106th - 109th  )which include an inside 360 degree observation deck and bar and an exterior deck where you can see the crazy "rides" that hang off the side of the building! There is a very good restaurant called Top of the World, which rotate slowly 360 degrees for a full view of the city. The food was great and not overly expensive for what it is.. . Just don't get sucked into going on a tour for a time share..which they try to get you into if you ask for a shuttle or taxi!!
We have gone to Lounge 107 several times for happy hour before shows or dinner. Fellini's Italian restaurant on first floor has been phenomenal. Also, Frankie Moreno is a must see show. Pay an extra $11 so you can pick a VIP table. It's worth it. I am not cheap and if I have a discount on food I tip generously on the full amount of the original bill. However, at Lounge 107, we had a party of six for half price drinks. Beware that they take advantage and charge you a tip of 18% for the party of six or more which is no problem except they tack it on to what the bill would have been without happy hour. We had one round of drinks delivered for the six of us and the tip added was over $37. I think this policy is totally out of line for one trip to the table.
Okay so I show up at 7:30 am and ask to check in early.  I know that there is an early check in fee because when I called the night before they told me $20.  When I check in the front desk clerk says its $30 because I'm checking in before 10am.  CRAZY!! but at this point I am already here, so yes charge me the extra $30.  Then she tells me I am booked for a standard room and I say yes.  She ask would you like to upgrade to our renovated part of the hotel, I ask is it a standard room?  Yes, she replies...then what is the upgrade if it is a standard room?  Is the upgrade the renovation?  The hotel at this point is on my get the hell out like in a horror film.  I ask for a non smoking room the room she gives me smells worse then the hallway.  The rooms are old and dingy, while housekeeping does a good job at keeping the room clean because it is so old is looks dirty.  This hotel should not be given such a high rating on any hotel search site.  It lacks luster and over charging for basically the same room at the hotel 6.  Other people Yelp are much to kind to rate the hotel at a 3-star....It really is worse.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! RAW SEWAGE is considered acceptable and unworthy of a comp. Since 0 or negative stars aren't an option, 1 star is the lowest rating I can give. Check in Wednesday, October 8th: informed our room wasn't available and we were offered a larger room at the same rate, and a later check out time. The "larger room" was 2 floors below with a "view" of the rooftop generators. When we tried to use the jacuzzi tub, raw sewage started bubbling from the shower drain and bar sink. The smell was nauseating as you can imagine, and when we reported this to the hotel maintenance they didn't arrive for 2 HOURS! After our flight we just wanted to relax in our room. Unfortunately, our room smelled like a cesspool and the rattle and hum of the generators was constant and annoying. Also the carpet by the sink, was saturated which we believed was from the shower drain, but was assured it was a leak from the fridge. When maintenance arrived they were unable to fix the sewage leak, so we were relocated AGAIN to another room. Although the plumbing worked, we were on a lower floor and directly across from the rooftop generators. (Stratosphere was aware of a plumbing issue between the 3-13 floors because we were advised that the plumbing would be turned off for 3 hours on Thursday for "maintenance.") After speaking to "hotel management" we were assured that we would be comped our first night's stay, since we had to change our rooms twice due to their mistakes. The generator's rumblings were louder due to them being directly outside our window, but at least our room didn't wreak of sewage. When we checked out Friday, we were under the impression that we would be comped the first night due to the phone call we received, but were advised they weren't aware of any issue despite the fact our hotel resort fee was refunded. Why would the resort fee be refunded unless there was an issue? You weren't AWARE of it and it wasn't NOTED anywhere? That sounds pretty suspicious to me. After explaining our situation to the supervisor, she said they don't do room comps, but could offer a later check out time. I again mentioned the raw sewage and she retorted that they don't comp out rooms. Since our flight wasn't until 8pm, we decided to take the late check out and drop our luggage off in the room. We were assured that our old key cards would work. Surprise, surprise, the keys were deactivated and we had to fall back in line to reactivate our keys. While we were in our room changing into our street clothes, maintenance knocked on our door because our check in was still noted at 1pm and not 5pm. We had to inform him that our check out time was changed recently, but they didn't bother to inform him. In conclusion, don't book at Stratosphere. You will NOT get the room you book, just whatever room is available.  If a sewage leak is found, you'll be downgraded to an even crappier room. If they claim to comp anything get it in writing because they don't honor their word. If they offer you a later check out time, make sure they re-key your cards and maintenance is informed. WORST HOTEL experience EVER!!
Even though the Stratosphere hotel is not as modern as the Venetian or Bellagio or Caesars Palace or Palazzo just to name a few..Still it was able to sustain its iconic name as one of the pillars of that makes up the Las Vegas. Just being on top of the tower, over looking the million of colors that lights up the city. man made beauty.
Not bad for the price. Room was clean. Bed wasn't very comfortable, but sufficient. I would advise not walking around outside the hotel late at night, especially as a female. The neighborhood is sketchy and dark.  The diner inside is open 24 hours and was pretty good quality and price. Must do the rides on top of the hotel!! Expensive but fun!
I was extremely disappointed with my recent stay. The room I had was very dated, furniture and light fixture from the 80's. The picture of the room on the website is nothing compared to what I received at check in. Advertise to be on the strip which isn't in a nice neighborhood or in walking distance to "The Strip". I guess it's true you get what you pay for !!!!!
I had such an enjoyable time here that it earned them an extra star.  Okay, so it's located at the end of the strip and the surroundings take a decided turn for the worse about one intersection away.  I expected this so it wasn't a big deal, but I was worried about my gf's impression as this was her first Vegas trip.  . . We arrived about 10:30 pm.  The self-service lot is a lot less sketchy than some of the others we ended up using; I had no concerns parking.  Check in was painfully slow, and we were plagued by foreign tourists that had very different attitudes re: private space.  I was feeling pretty violated by the time another employee arrived.  They did not have the room I'd reserved (and prepaid for), so we were given the only other alternative, which was two queen beds and a beautiful view of the tower (and casino roof).  The room was otherwise nice enough, except that the curtains were broken and we were only able to draw the blackout curtain halfway.  . . I was very impressed with the professionalismand helpfulness of the staff.  However, if you're a couple and someone from the staff approaches you and asks if you're married, be prepared for a sales pitch.  This happened a few times by the escalators/Starbucks area.  Annoying. . . It takes a long, long time to collect jackpots at the slots, and the entire time you're left sitting at the machine with little explanation...you can't even use the machine until it's reset.  But I'm not complaining too much...I was very happy that I managed to win that much.  . . We ended up giving a lot of that money back, but we had a very, very good time.  And we'll definitely be taking them up on those free nights....
The only reason I went this far down the strip was for the sky jump (awesome by the way, seriously people do it!) we took the tram from the strip to the hotel. Okay so let me put it this way. When you take the tram to a hotel on the strip you end up some place nice. When you take the tram to this location you end up in the ghetto. A random stop where you have to walk down stairs and into the ghetto neighborhood around the stratosphere. For the love of Jesus himself don't make my mistake and do this after the sun goes down. You will more than likely get mugged or shot. When I did jump off the top of the needle I looked down and saw lots of police lights in the neighborhood around the hotel. Overall moral of the story: take a taxi
Without having to bid on priceline, I got a special nightly rate for only $67 from Amoma.com. The room is big, nice and clean. The hotel has several restaurants and the one I like the best is the Italian Restaurant. One of the nice things about this hotel is just located a couple block away from the strip and walking to the strip isn't a challenge. I also like about the big nice pool there .
Back to their old tricks. . . On my last two trips, the A/C was not working in either room. As a matter of fact, I only have ever stayed in the "Select" rooms, so these are allegedly the renovated ones. After waiting in line 30+ minutes after 9pm to Check In, I was horrified that my room was the one on the end, next to the vending and ice machine (this is my first stay actually having seen these machines they are so hidden). Anyway, No. The room looked great and the A/C worked and it looked clean except the last filthy low life smoked illegal narcotics in the room. Yep. The drug of choice for low lifes: marijuana. Guess what? I'm allergic!  My allergies were ruined for 2 days all because of that.  So I had to march all the way down back to the lobby, wait in line again, and had the very nasty Greek lady tell me I should take a non smoking room otherwise they would not switch me again...oh yes they would I stay here every month... . Anyway, the new room did not smell but *everything* that was not bolted down was stolen. No Ash Tray, No Cups, No Bible (and yes I read it especially in Las Vegas). The A/C in the room hardly worked at all, the hallway was cooler. I noticed the floor looked dirty and what initially appeared to be rust around the base of the plastic bath tub. I put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly and figured out that housekeeping did a lousy job or the toilet was simply left overflowed for a few days and never cleaned up hence the stains. . . IDC if the rooms are either free or next to free but I may just start paying to stay where I play when they don't comp me. I was just here for a job interview that was a complete waste of my time.
Disclaimer: A lengthy review but I feel it'll help for families especially. I'll summarize the key points:. . - Greedy, unethical and bad customer service by the management. The employees and workers themselves are nicer though.. - Nothing special in the resort for which you're charged 18-35 per night. . - Even their remodeled premium rooms are at par with a Holiday Inn at best. . - Poorly ventilated lobby and casino.. - Be sure to check your bill on checkout!. . I'm writing this after giving Stratosphere a second chance. The first time was last year when I came to visit Vegas with my friends. We were rarely in the hotel so a lot of things went unnoticed or we didn't care for them. But on checkout we were charged ~50 bucks evidently for some paid programming. I didn't make sense coz firstly, we didn't watch any paid TV and secondly, we had gone to the Grand Canyons that day! When I requested them to recheck and give us a refund, the front desk person went back to talk to their manager. While she offered to revert the charge, she was very disgruntled about it and even said "we'll let it go this time but next time you will have to pay for it". It was the total opposite of what good customer service is about. One would expect an apology or "we'll look into it for you" at the least. I wonder if it was one of their housekeeping folks taking the liberty in our room since we were gone all day, but it surely wasn't us and that wasn't the way to handle the situation for sure!. . In any case, this year I gave them a second chance when I decided to go with my family (wife and a 2 year old). BIG MISTAKE. For families considering the Stratosphere Hotel, especially with younger kids/babies, this is NOT the place to stay. You will be better off staying a little off the strip if you don't want to pay for a higher end hotel on the strip. And here are the reasons I say this:. . 1. Our kid is a very picky eater. We prepared his meals from home and figured any hotel would have a microwave and refrigerator. Not this one. The refrigerator was 10 bucks extra per night. I don't know if that's the standard offering on Vegas strip hotels now, but I'm pretty sure a Holiday Inn could've offered better. As for the microwave, they said it was a health and safety hazard, so they don't even offer them for a fee anymore. I had to ask around and a nice lady working at the Starbucks told me that the Circle K gas station across the street had a microwave I could use. So that saved the trip for us. . . 2. I get the sense that Stratosphere's employees are nice, but their management is greedy and has the wrong idea of good customer service. One of the housekeeping people even said they can find us a microwave, but never came back. So at least she offered. One of the fast food places in their retail shops area had two nice employees who even offered to warm up my kid's food once I explained them the situation. By the time I came back with the food to warm it up, the owner of the fast food place was present. And he would not let me warm up my kid's food! I assured him there was no health hazard since the food was in a sealed microwave safe container. His explanation: the baby could burn his mouth and it would be an insurance issue on him. Again - I was appalled at how their management was concerned about their own ass and didn't care for a customer's child who was hungry. . . 3. It's not all about the kid's food or the lack of a micro or fridge. They pitch their newly remodeled "premier" rooms as if they're the hottest thing out. Forget about offering a free upgrade. It's all about squeezing the extra bucks for them. Said rooms were only up to par with other retail chain hotel rooms. Not terrible to be fair, but nothing special either.. . 4. Also be prepared for a resort fee between 18-35 dollars per night. Mandatory. That would be acceptable except that there really isn't much they offer as a resort. The pool on the 8th floor is boring compared to those at other places. It was messy, dull and poorly organized. I used the pool only once on each trip and both times felt no need to revisit. The tower access is free for anyone and so is access to the observation deck.. . 5. The entrance lobby is dull, gloomy and smokey. Very uninviting and again, not well ventilated for children.
My husband and I came here in July for one night (a Monday night) at this hotel.  We had never stayed at Stratosphere before, but we were already on that end of the Strip, so we decided to chance it for a night for $30.  We wanted to check in before noon, but that wasn't happening unless we paid $20 extra.  No thanks.  I was able to pay and do all of the paperwork, but they were not going to give us the key to our room unless we paid that $20.  We checked our bags and off we went to grab lunch.. . After 3pm (normal check in time), I had to stand in line again, just to get my room key and officially check in (even though at noon, I had done all the paperwork and paid).  Seemed a little silly to me, but whatever.  The line was long and not moving very fast.  I noticed while in line that there were a lot of families at this hotel.. . Got checked in, got a basic room w/ a king sized bed.  Definitely nothing fancy.  . . Check out was just as bad as check in (at 730 in the morning!).  Long line, one worker.  It took FOREVER.  . . The casino was fine, it kept me busy for a while.  The shops seemed empty and the workers seemed bored.  Not a lot of foot traffic for a Monday.. . With our room reservation, we were able to visit the observation deck for free. That was nice.  Standing in anotherLONG line to get up to the observation deck was not so nice.  But once we got up there, it was cool.  Enough room to roam around, great views, and rides if you dared (we didn't).  We did notice a lot of kids.. . It was fine for a night, but I probably wouldn't stay there again.
If this is your first time in Vegas, note that this hotel is located at the far end of the strip, away from the vibrant lights.  For this reason, I would not stay at the Stratosphere, and recommend one of the hotels at the core of the strip.  The interior of this hotel is clean, well maintained, and has the basic amenities, but the atmosphere in the lobby and casino is somber, and a bit depressing.  I would pay more for a room near the center of the strip, where all the action takes place.  Make it a fun trip, and enjoy your stay.  With a bit of research, you should be able to find a good deal at the heart of the strip.. . What the Stratosphere lacks are live music and a club that draws a large crowd to the hotel.  A few of the hotels have live music blaring near the casino, which brings life to the atmosphere.  Others have a popular club that everyone talks about when they're in Vegas.  Unfortunately, the Stratosphere has neither, which adversely impacts your experience at the hotel.
I am so disappointed in the valets customer service. I had no one directing me for my car so when I pulled up I pulled up in a spot so I wouldn't block a walkway. I got out of my car and pulled out everything myself and set it on the side of my car. And stood waiting for someone for a few min. Finally a guy starts waving at me to pull my car forward. I said I'm not going to put all my stuff back in my car to drive up 10 feet. He proceeded to roll his eyes at me and came over and told me that I needed to pull my car up. He made me have to leave my stuff sitting on the sidewalk so I could pull the car up myself. They were all rude to me and had terrible customer service. I work at the Wynn and this kind of thing would never ever happen there EVER!
