I can't believe the overall rating is only three stars. Yes, it's a buffet, and no, it isn't in the same league as the top-tier buffets on the Strip (Caesar's, Wynn, Bellagio), but I went here twice for breakfast on my most recent Vegas trip and came away very impressed.. . I'm not a big breakfast guy, but the selection was wide. The wait staff was extremely attentive and always made sure our drinks were full. Prices were reasonable for the breakfast buffet ($17 and change per person), and the atmosphere is nice. It's a great place to grab breakfast, even speaking as someone whose first meal of the day is usually lunch.
Arrived early on a Sunday night.  There was hardly anyone in front of us in line, yet it took FOREVER.  Still don't get it, as it took us very little time to pay when we got up there.  (yes, added a tip).  Then it took somewhat forever again before someone seated us.  . . Took off for the buffet, and was seriously UNimpressed!  Favorite part for me (the ONLY part) was the Italian section. Meatballs and sausage were good.  Liked that they had crushed red pepper to kick things up. Broccolini good.  After that I had a hard time finding anything that looked edible.  Even the seafood section was only so-appealing.  Had a couple crab legs (ice cold) and okay.  The other fish selections didn't make me want them.. . Husband was raving over a pork taco in the Mexican section.  They were out of them when I went up there.  Later found one and it was okay.  Nobody working there seemed glad to be there (especially the folks replenishing the food).  . . Kinda sad that I wasted my limited Vegas time and money here, honestly.
excellent buffet at excellent price. we got the 24 hour pass and it was an amazing deal. the buffet had everything you can want and all was very fresh.
The Spice Market Buffet, located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino is an average buffet that focuses on typical American entrees, but also offers a decent variety of different ethnic foods. . . After purchasing the buffet of buffets 24hr pass my friends and I decided to give the Spice Market a try. We came in at around 10:30AM, so we were lucky to have both breakfast and lunch entrees. . . The decor is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic, especially for a popular hotel that is on the strip. The staff was adequate and the wait times weren't too long.. . The food was average at best. There weren't any distinctive entrees. I expected some nice sandwiches, soups, salads, and breakfast specialties. Unfortunately there were no sandwiches but there was an adequate carving station that offered some decent prime rib. . . Overall the Spice Market Buffet is a bit of a let down, but considering the list of buffets to choose from the buffet of buffets, the Spice Market isn't that bad of a choice. But if you decide to pay full price for the Spice Market then I'd advise you to go somewhere else, especially since there's so many great buffet options in Vegas. To good eatings.
SLow service, paid for all you can drink beer , but good luck finding waitress to get a 2nd drink. Seafood selection was surprisingly good and fresh compared to the rest of the buffet. Dessert section was a major let down
I'm not normally a buffet person, but after getting out of a full morning of meetings, my colleagues and I were starving. It was around 2 pm, and after wandering around the mall, looking for something semi-decent, we desperately stopped in here. . To say that my expectations were low would be under-selling it. This is not like the Bacchanal or the buffet in the Bellagio. This is more like a fancier Golden Corral or Furrs Cafeteria.  . There two decent sized salad bars, plenty of cheeses, breads and cured meats, and an around the world theme with different stations with different themes. .  I really enjoyed the broccolini in the Italian section, and the mashed potatoes in the American section. Everything else was fairly unmemorable. The fish and chips was pretty greasy, the pizza was bland. The hummus was mediocre. . The major reasons to come here are the price and convenience. With the Ceasars Total Rewards card, you get the weekday lunch buffet for $17.
I wanted to give this place more stars, but it felt like a very uneven experience. The buffet is a solid size. Everyone working was very friendly and attentive.. Buffet is set up in sections. Mexican, Asian, Italian, Seafood, Mediterranean, salad and desserts. Hopefully I'm not leaving any out.. The Italian and Mediterranean were fantastic! Especially the Mediterranean: lamb, mango chutney, best feta I've ever had.. However, Mexican, and Asian were not up to par for me. . Desserts were also awesome.. Another minor minor complaint, was the utensils to grab food at the buffet are metal and they are in very hot dishes. So sometimes the metal utensils are too hot to grab. Maybe I'm the only one! . . I would go again, but stick with Italian, Mediterranean and desserts.
My husband and I stopped by here for dinner on the way to our hotel after the show. We did not know what expect, especially that we went to Caesars palace buffet the night before and were so disappointed. Here, it was not super busy but selection was very good, a lot to choice from, and excellent , excellent quality of food and bakery!!!!! My husband is peaky eater, and normally at buffets he leaves food that he does not like. This time, his plates were empty!!!! Meat has been done perfect !!!! Crab legs were very good, so is seafood in general!!! We liked it a lot, so the morning before we left Vegas, we stopped there for breakfast!!! It was another winner!!! Smoothes, selection of different type of eggs were great. Crepe station and bakery were excellent. Omelets were super!!! My favorite is eggs with spinach &mushrooms, omg, taste of heaven.     :)
Nothing to write home about at Spice Market Buffet.  We ate here out of sheer convenience since we were staying at PH and needed a quick breakfast.  There was a variety of foods, but meh.  No one went back up for seconds.  I wouldn've been even more disappointed if I wasn't able to expense that meal.  Take a cab down to Hash House... its worth the cab fare and getting up early!
Pretty disappointed. Although this place brought back found memories of my elementary school cafeteria... It was a far cry from the expectation set by Bellagio and Ceasars.  Save yourself the cash and play it on black. This place had great service, with cold, mediocre food at best.
Typically buffet. Dried out food and over priced. Don't go without a discount of some kind. Go the Denny's for breakfast instead.
Pathetic and stale food. The lamb skewers and chicken curry was hard, cold and tasteless respectively. Tried the crab cakes and was very disappointed. Maybe coz I have recently been spoiled living in Boston.. . Update: Later that night my fried who was with me threw up and guess what the undigested contents were? . . Also, this place is overpriced, with deceptive advertising. All through the casino they are advertising a $12 buffet and when you stand in a line for 5-7 minutes you get stiffed with an almost $60 charge for 2 which is prepaid - so you don't really have an option.. . (FYI- this review is from April 2011. It was sitting in the 'drafts folder of my Yelp account)
We had the lunch buffet with all you can drink mimosas.  The greeter offered to let us look at the food before purchasing and we should have listened to her.  . . Positive - our waitress was great. . Negative - very expensive, food was dried out, cold when should have been warm, warm if supposed to be cold, pineapple was bruised all over.  I was surprised they put it out.  How do you screw up Mexican rice?  They figured it out.  How do you screw up bacon?  They mastered it.  Everything was gross - even the egg rolls.  I was shocked that my husband grabbed the eggs Benedict.  It was so NASTY!!  The place had few people so we should have known better.  The pico de gallo was old and obviously stored for awhile.  . . We should not have eaten here.  We were only here for one more day and we wasted it here.  . . I would never recommend this place!!
Loved the fact that the chef Jessie Aquino willing walked me through the Buffett to show me the gluten free items, I was shocked to see so many options! Loved the crab!!!! Loved the fact that he was so knowledgeable of gluten (he actually just finished the FAI training) so I felt secure and for the first time in ages I am not ill 2 days later
Umm...four Category: Middle Eastern, Italian, Mexican and & Seafood. . . Sounds good...but no. Each selection had a few items to choose from. I would say, 4-5 items per category...that's pretty bad for the amount being spent. . . Seafood was enjoyable, but everything was not. . . Should have gone to M or Rio, only reason why I gave them a shot was bc we booked a room here. . . First and last time here. Buffet should have a large selection for top dollars...I don't mind paying $40-$50 if it's has a bigger selection. . . Dessert was good...their flan is awesome and they have cotton candy.  but can your money worth elsewhere.
