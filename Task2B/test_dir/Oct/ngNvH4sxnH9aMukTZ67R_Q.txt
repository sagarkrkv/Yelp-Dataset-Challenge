If you're going to treat yourself to just one buffet during your trip to Las Vegas, this would not be my choice.. . It's fairly standard, as far as Las Vegas buffets go.  There is a large variety, the quality is decent, and the service is quite good.  But overall, I would say it is nothing overly special, at least when compared to other options in Las Vegas.  . . For me, one of the main reasons to try a buffet is to sample various deserts that you may not find anywhere else.  The desert options here were a bit lacking and uninspired.  I suspect most of the deserts are pre-packaged.
My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas for his birthday.  We decided to check out The Carnival Buffet since there was a pretty good deal on Groupon.  . . We came in during lunch time and got seated fairly quickly.  Like most international buffets, the food was separated by country, there was American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Chinese.  As soon as we were shown our table we were off to the races.  We tried a little bit of everything and just as we expected everything was just average. The desserts were just average as well.  Nothing to go telling your friends or family about.  . . With the Groupon came a free wine bottle which we had to go pickup at the bar.  When we first went to the bar the bartender wasn't there....10 minutes later bartender still not there....another 10 minutes bartender still not there....another 10 minutes still not there By this time, we were getting pretty frustrated (and we're pretty patient people). We had to ask one of the chefs and he couldn't find the bartender.  There was another lady waiting at the bar trying to get her free bottle, as well.  I thought that was very unprofessional.  To not only leave your station but not even telling anyone about it.  It wasn't until we were done with our meals that the bartender showed up.  No apologies, no excuses; he acted like there was nothing wrong. He just had a look on his face showing that he did not want to be there.  We just took our bottle and jetted out of there.  . . The service from the other staff members were great! Just the bartender kind of ruined our experience because we were looking forward to drinking our free wine while eating our lunch.. . Overall this place is a good buffet to go to if your on a budget.  It's not bad but it's not great either. If it weren't for that Groupon, I most likely would never step in here.
Was very disappointed the crab legs were very small and the most disgusting part is the prime rib ! Way way over cooked no taste what so ever ! If you think your gonna get your Money's worth because this is $$$  don't bother and go somewhere else.
I went here about 3 weeks ago looking to try out a new buffet. The best parts of the buffet were the braised beef ribs and the carne asada. Other than that, most of the food was either bland or meh. Some of the food they had actually tasted like it was pre-heated. Anyway, if this is the best you can afford I'd go here, but for me personally I'd rather save up and go some place better.
Food was average at best and the bartender was extremely rude. Although our server Brian was terrific, the bartender Bernard had a serious attitude problem, poured the wrong drink for my sister in law before she could even say what she wanted and he insulted my baby. The customer service, aside from that of our server, was horrible.
No complaints at all here. While I have not been to many Vegas Buffets I really enjoyed this one. Great variety of foods. Tasted great, the services was friendly and fast. The deserts were VERY VERY GOOD. . . If you go you have to try the noodle station, that was my favorite. Incredibly tasty sauteed noodles. . They have gelato for deserts and their signature item was: . . Banana Foster. WOW This Banana Foster is what will make you want to go back the next day. DO NOT SKIP IT. It's that good, buttery with a creamy rum sauce. It was heavenly . . . Price was around $33 per person which was reasonable for a buffet in Vegas. No complaints, would go back!
This place is has tons of options and taste great! We've been here no less than a dozen times. We always know what to expect. . . Service stunk this time! We were there at 4pm, almost empty, took waitress forever to bring me hot water .. when she finally came, we were done with the meal, and then she refused to provide me with a togo cup. Why even bother bringing it then, useless.
Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all. Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. . . I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. . . I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!. . Pricing is in line with other buffer. . . Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. . . Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.
$62.68 for two people- My old lady and I ate here with a group of friends. A lot of food and all different type of food.. For a buffet and for the price- this is good place. Service is good also
This buffet has a huge selection and the food was very good.  What we did not understand was why we were left to stand 20 feet from the register with no explanation for nearly an hour before we (about 100 people) could be allowed to sit and eat.. . I spoke with the manager and she was very apologetic but man did that unorganized situation upset a whole lot of customers, myself included.. . In the end, we turned our frowns upside down and had a teriffic time at the buffet.
