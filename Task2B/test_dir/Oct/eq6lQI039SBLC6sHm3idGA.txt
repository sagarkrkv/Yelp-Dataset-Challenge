$4.50 for a slice of pizza and about $28 for a whole pizza (8 slices).. . White pizza was AMAZING. The other pizzas were pretty decent as well. . . I'm usually not a fan of crush (I suck, I know), but this place has the best dough that makes their crust absolutely delicious!!!. . I'm definitely coming back.
If this is supposed to be a secret it must be Vegas' worst kept secret with 1900+ reviews. Officially this pizza shop doesn't have a name.... . Many a Yelper have just accidentally stumbled onto this pizza place in the Cosmopolitian en route to something else. Unlike them, I cheated, using Yelp and the Internet to do the dirty work for me. It also helps that I saw other people just randomly going into the 3rd floor with whole pizza boxes. Once you hit the 3rd floor, look between Jaleo (the Spanish place) and Blue Ribbon (sushi) for a small hallway filled with records.. . The pizza place is supposed to be small and simple; No1DP notes that it's reminiscent of the pizza joints he used to frequent back in NY/NJ. There's seating and counter space only for ~5 people and there's only 2 pinball games. The concept's really simple: pick pizza for slice or customize a whole pie. . . No1DP was craving pizza as Japan really doesn't know how to do a good pizza. I was there for another reason: to try the concoction known as "white pie".. Crust: Thin and crunchy, which the No1DP says is the way to do a New York-style pizza. The pizza gets cold quickly so eat it while you can. No1DP says that this is why you see people eat this pizza fast - there's not much crust to absorb the heat.. -Veggie Supreme: Came to ~$8.00/slice as he had lots of toppings. He says that this is the best pizza he's had in a while and can easily put this in the top 10 pizza joints he's visited.. -White Pie ($5.50): The No1DP said to me that each pizza joint does their white pie differently, but in essence this is a cheese pizza with NO tomato sauce. When fresh off the oven the cheese is stringy but it held together well. I really liked the garlic and they are generous with the ricotta - this soft cheese literally just melts in your mouth! . . Definitely a must for late night eating, especially if you've been clubbing all day!
Secret Pizza was awesome!. . Save yourself however, if you're ordering two slices per person, and order a whole pie! I paid $35.00 for 6 slices.. . Nonetheless it was perfect for a second night delight where we weren't really hungry but still wanted something to eat. We arrived to find a short line but it went fast. They had all kinds of different pies by the slice and beer to go too.. . Go for the white-- So delicious and yummy. Not sure I was a fan of the sausage and Ricotta but it was good enough. Add some parmesan and a light dusting of Garlic Salt/powder on your Pizza for added deliciousness.. . It smelled great and we got quite the looks from people as we headed down and back to our condo (We're staying nearby at The Jockey Club) as we traipsed through 3 floors of the Cosmo with Giant NY Style pieces of pizza. . . DEFINITELY GO!
Get ready to wait in line but don't worry it moves fast ! Very affordable pizza for drinkers and non drinkers after parties and crazy night!!
So excited I found it. The pizza crust is light and delicious . The ricotta pizza was amazing. My boyfriend loved the veggie pizza . . Look for the hallway with albums. No signs ! 3rs floor across from pool table!
Ehhh don't really get the hype for this place. The pizza is decent but nothing mind-blowing and not worth it for how pricey each slice is. There wasn't much of a selection when we got there at 4AM. I will say that it's awesome this place is open that late though. I'm not the biggest fan of pizza, so I'll probably look elsewhere for a late night option.
We had a fun time trying to find this place and I especially liked the white pizza. The normal pizza with tomato sauce was pretty average tasting so I would highly suggest getting their white pizzas!
Drive all the way from LA to eat this pizza & every time it is amazing. Tastes so bomb, especially after the club. A long line is nothing when you have an explosion of flavor in your mouth with every bite. so in love
The pizza's pretty good, and the idea is fun.  Is it the best pizza I've ever had?  Not really, but I like the idea.  I wouldn't make the trip unless you're pretty close by.  The pizza's pretty pricey at 4.50/slice and the slices aren't very big.  The sodas are $4 so you can save some dough by bringing your own drink.. . Location:  look for album covers all over a hallway on the 3rd floor.  There is a pool table in a sitting area across from the hallway.
I am not sure what the hype is about. The white pizza was probably one of the worse I have eaten. I ate 1 and a half slices before I had to give it up.. It may be a requirement to be drunk to enjoy (or not care) this pizza. Surely hunger cannot persuade one to say this is good pizza.. At $28 for a single pie, I am very displeased. I'm adding a photo.
Great just hole in the wall pizza place. Has a nice New York style pizza location. Pizza is well flavored and has nice ambiance. Only like 7 chairs along the walls. The major plus is that they will even make a Chicago style deep crust from time to time.
The secret is... Delicious!
The best pizza in Las Vegas!!!! Pretty, pretty please Secret Pizza will you open an second location too :) We'll keep that spot Secret too.  The only downside about this place is the line to get pizza sometimes, but truly of the spots to bring all your friends who come to visit Las Vegas.
love the goat cheese pizzas! Open super late, and sometimes a long line. Not so secret
3.5 stars. . We came here at 3 am on a Saturday night and ordered a whole pie with 5 toppings, which cost $36. We waited 30 minutes in line and another 30 minutes for our pizza to come out. Was it worth it...? Ehhhh, the pizza was good but I don't think it was quite worth the money or time. Sure, it was pretty satisfying asa late night snack and tasted even better in our hotel room the next morning. But I don't think I would wait another for it.
Great pizza, but at The Strip prices. I can't say enough good things about the food from  this place. The white pizza is fantastic. Possibly the best and greasiest white pizza I've had. The home made meatball slices are also really great. The only unfortunate thing is the price per slice. It's The Strip, it's what you expect, but it's still a bummer.
The pizza here is fabulous! Try the white pizza, you won't regret it! It's a little greasy, so the perfect place to stop if you've been drinking down on the strip and craving some delicious pizza. . . The only downside is the prices (though they're not ridiculous for the Strip - like 5$ for a big slice of pizza) and that they can get super crowded later in the evening. They also don't have seating, so you grab your pizza to go and eat it on the couches in the lobby outside! (This place would really be ideal if you were staying in the cosmo.)
Soooo yummy! Long line to wait though and it's definitely secret! There are no signs. But it was worth the wait and when we carried it back to our hotel room we had so many people asking us for a slice and where we got it. Delicious!!
Hidden but not enough because the line was long! Luckily the line went fast and the staff was nice and pleasant. I had a slice of sausage and ricotta. Mmmmmm. Thin crust, fresh toppings. So good!!! I forgot to order a cannoli so I will definately be back!
"Secret Pizza" (I believe this is an unofficial name...right?) is located down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  I felt silly asking someone, "Excuse me, where is Secret Pizza," but thankfully he was in on it and directed us there.. . Walk down the 30 foot hall and you're transported from the glitz of the Cosmo into what looks like a small-town pizza joint.  There are no tables (just a couple counter spots) and the decor consists mainly of 2 pin ball machines.. . I just had a cheese slice. (Slices are $4.75, + 50 cents for each topping. Standard Vegas prices, but I could've easily turned those 5 bucks into $5,000 on slots).  The pizza is very good, similar to a slice you'd get in New York.  The one problem we had is that our slices were not heated up enough, and were on the cool side of lukewarm.. . I don't think there's any reason for Secret Pizza to be a "destination"...but if you're staying in the hotel or happen to be passing through, it's a good spot for a slice.
I like secrets.  I like pizza.  Its  only natural that I would like them combined!  Secret pizza is the pizza by the slice joint on the third floor of the cosmopolitan. There's no sign, so you'll either have to follow your nose or look for the hallway line with framed records and pictures of musicians. Once you find it, head on in.  We had the white slice with pepperoni and the meatball ricotta slice. Both were SO GOOD.  I love the crispness of pizza by the slice and secret pizza really crisps it up.  The white slice was good, but the money was really on the meatball ricotta.  The missus really summed it up... its like eating a slice of lasagna.  It's the perfect end to a late night and is pretty much the same price as pizza by the slice at home. Give it a try!
Damn good p-za but, fyi its only one $ relative to the location. 6$ a slice? But if your drunk hungry and close, then its definitely worth it. Cheers
You are the pizza of my dreams. The cheese, the sauce, the crust, all fresh tasting and amazing.  My favorite slice is probably the jalapeno and pepperoni, a spicy concoction that makes my mouth feel alive.  But, every single  one of the slice choices I've tasted have been quite good. . . I love getting a slice and sitting in the lounge area in front of the restaurant. The cool Mad Men furniture, the pool table, as well as the great people watching make this a great space to eat amazing pizza.  Secret pizza is sorrounded by several shi shi restaurants, as well as a cool art gallery, so there's plenty to check out. (My favorite people watching experience there was seeing some dude roll up on a Sunday afternoon in his white bathrobe and slippers, carrying his newspaper, walking around the crowded lounge like he was in his living room...). . Is it pricey for pizza?  Yes it is. But the quality more than makes up for it. It's one of the places I absolutely make sure to visit when I come to Vegas.
I love this place and try to get there every time I'm in Vegas. It's also in one of the swankiest hotels, Cosmopolitan! I've waited in a long line and it is worth it. My only regret is when I get one slice and should have gotten two!
The SECRET is out.. . Well, at least I'm not kept in the dark about the secret anymore.  Thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U, I was finally became aware of the secret location of this pizza mecca that everyone seemed to know of except me (at least until recently).. . I think the "secret" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.. . Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.  . . NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.. . SERVICE:  Quick, courteous, and efficient.. . BOTTOM LINE:  Secret no more!  I'll be back!
THIRD FLOOR. Every. Single. Time. I walk around the second floor not understanding why I am so lost. This place is amazing though - a little hidden oasis (that it seems everyone knows about but it is still never packed). The only time I've ever seen a line (nearly out the door!!!) was at 3 am one day and I'm not quite sure why. It was a sad day indeed, though.. . It is the perfect stop on the way back to the hotel after a long night out, for sure. Usually plenty of space to stand at the counter and shove some pizza in your face so you can go to bed full and happy. Plus, $6 for a giant slice of pizza in Cosmo is NOT a bad thing!
Might be hard to find if you don't know about it, but I think it might be better that way.. . Reasonably priced slices, and probably the best pizza on the strip. There was no line when I went but I could see there being a bit of a wait if you went later on in the night or ordered an entire pie.. . Next time I'll be sure to bring a quarter or two as well to enjoy the arcade machines while I'm eating instead of heading straight back out into the casino.
As the name suggests, this pizza joint is somewhat a secret, i.e. hard to find. No signage, down a hallway and away from the casino madness of the Cosmopolitan. . . It's open until 5 a.m. and they serve really good pizza and have a great selection of old school video games. . . It's worth finding, especially for late night Vegas noshing that so many of us crave.
I love the pizza here. Every time my boyfriend and I go here there is a mile long line but definitely worth the wait. I think $40 for 5 slices of pizza is a bit much but it's definitely must do when we're down at Cosmo. The staff is always friendly also which is a huge plus!
greatest pizza EVER. . If your in vegas you definitely need to make a trip to Cosmo for a slice!. My friends and I split a whole pie, so it wasn't expensive at all. . . We've been there several times and it's a lot better during the day. At night there's always a line and you have to deal with annoying drunk people yelling in your ear. Still worth the wait though, and the Cosmo is pretty rad  so that's always a plus ^.^
One of the best pizzas I've tried. Italian and Sicilian pizza highly recommended. If u like cheese pizza try their white pizza! Bomb!
Is this place for real?????!?!? IMHO Pizzeria Mozza has the best pizza of all time, and it's a solid 10 in my book. My bf had told me that the secret pizza is "up there" and is about a 9.5. I was skeptical, but when I tasted the pizza, I was floored by the texture flavor, and chewiness of the crust. For me, the pizza is in the crust. I don't know what they put in their dough, but it is hands down the best here out of most places I've tried.. . I tried both the red sauce meat lovers pizza and the white sauce. I generally like the red sauce pizza better, so preferred the red.  . . I'm going to be a repeat customer for sure. Oh my gosh, it is SO good.
A hidden gem at the Cosmopolitan!  The best pizza I have had in a really long time. I got a plain slice and enjoyed every bite. . Definitely one of the best snack/ cheap eats in Vegas. . Highly recommend!!!
Everyone had told me about this place, and as a pizza lover, I had to check it out. It was pretty packed, and there isn't a whole lot of dining area in this small place. Of course I got a slice of the white pizza and a slice of mushroom. 2 slices, $10.50. Not super cheap, but average. . . After being heated, they were super oily, you have to dab and dab to get all the grease off. The pizza was good, the white pizza a little heavier, lots of ricotta, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I personally like ASONY in San Jose way better. My friend wasn't impressed either. Maybe our expectations were too high, but I can see this is the place to go if you want some pizza after a day/night of drinking.
Decent butslow and insanely overpriced. I guess it's the inn thing to do. I'm wondering how much is the most people will pay for a pizza. The 5 or 4 star reviews must be people with unlimited money or their being paid.
