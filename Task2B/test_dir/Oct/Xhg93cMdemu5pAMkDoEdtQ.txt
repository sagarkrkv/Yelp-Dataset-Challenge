Their dessert are super!  Well worth the price for a fabulous buger and hot dog with the kids.
Atmosphere crazy loud and smelled weird. Food came out cold even under the food lamps for fifteen minutes . Order came out wrong and super overpriced! What's up with the $4 charge for splitting a plate?
Terribly overpriced food. Service is awful. Do not go here unless you want to spend twenty bucks on a sandwich or burger that tastes like it's been stored in a freezer. If you love bad attitudes from servers and management, cheap overpriced food, and waiting forty five minutes to be seated then by all means .. This is the restaurant for you.
If you're a tourist then most likely you've seen this place in the Food Channel and how they are famous for their frozen hot chocolate. And that's about it. . . Food is nothing spectacular. You're better off paying $35 at the Cravings buffet in Mirage where you can get unlimited beer and wine for lunch and dinner.
Came here for a birthday. We were seated right away and given a giant menu. Its cute, nothing fancy, i had actually expected more modern. . . We were a bit thrown off by the reviews about the food and ordered the foot long chili dog with sweet potato fries and the nachos. . . The food didnt take too long but our waiter was pretty shitty. . We had a group of four seated next to us and one of the ladies was a bit tipsy. He was pretty rude to her and she ended up telling him that it was my friends birthday. . . The waiter said "then he gets water for his birthday" which was pretty silly. . . Anyways i didnt even ask if the hot dog was pork (which i don't eat) stupid of me not too but we asked later and they dont serve any beef hotdogs. Woops! So i didnt get to try it but my friend said it was okay. . . The nachos were great except the taco meat (beef) on them. Its cheap and gross tasting. . Besides that it was a large portion and pretty good. . . Our waiter barely came around and was more concerned with the table next to us than he was with us. Thank god the table next to us was talking to us the entire time. Great crowd in from South Carolina for a convention for State Farm. . Then we ordered the cookie cookie something ice cream sundae. . That was the best item. The chocolate chip cookie in it was nasty and hard but the sugar cookies were soft and the ice cream was great. . . The best part of our experience here was our neighbors from State Farm :) pun intended. . . Note:. If youre looking for a romantic night out this is not the place to go. Its busy and loud. . . Pros. Sweet potato fries were pretty good. Sundae was good :) . . Cons. Bad service. Rude waiter (ours was. Not speaking for others!) . Food is way overpriced and not worth it. . Taste is pretty cheap. Like fast food . . . Hot dog. Nachos. Ice cream. 2 waters . Cost $53
If negative stars were an option, this is what they would be getting. The Russian lady at the front was flat out RUDE to me when I asked for a veggie/vegan option. Please consider being more accommodating to your guests with special needs. She made me feel like it was wrong for me to not eat meat.
What do you do when you work somewhere that closes at 11pm and the current time is 10:53pm?. . How about lock the door and not let anyone else in.  Or from the takeout window tell people sorry we are closed.. . This is exactly what happened to us.  We spoke with the guy behind the sliding glass window and he told us that they could not make anything else because they had already begun to clean up for other night.  We pointed out the time and he said and I quote "ya, sorry".  We did get him to sell us a frozen hot chocolate and a diet Pepsi.  . . The frozen hot chocolate tastes like a fudge flavored Popsicle, pretty good but not worth the 10 bucks they charged for it.. . We sat at a table just outside the front door and watched as others approached and were turned away before the posted closing time.  We then watched as 17 groups over the next 25 minutes left disappointed.  I can't understand why a company would pay for such ridiculous rent to close early and watch dollar after dollar walk away.. . I recommend going to get gelato at the palazzo instead.  Much better and much cheaper-
All shakes and drinks start at a minimum of $10.  However, I must say the portions and food quality is very impressive.  I just wanted a simple root beer float, but when my wife's hot chocolate ice cream came out, I couldn't keep my spoon out.  Holy molee that was delicious.  It was in a huge wide glass bowl with a three layer piece of chocolate cake with whipped cream on top of vanilla and chocolate ice cream swimming in hot chocolate.  I think the description speaks for it's self.  We hammered at this euphoric dish, and still left over half of it in the bowl.  YUMMY!!!!. . The miniature tacos and piled high burgers looked incredible as well.  Sometimes you can just tell by looking at a dish that it is going to taste good.  Very pricey, but this is Vegas.  I would say the prices were very well stated as compared to anywhere else in Las Vegas.  However, there is a Sundae listed on the menu for $1000.  I did not see anyone order it, but if it didn't come with some kind of quality gold jewelry, I don't see how it could be worth it. . . I had to knock a star off for the 15 min wait and semi slow service.  It is a Sunday, and it did appear that no real management or leadership was in place.  I saw a lot of servers standing around waiting for something to do.  Meanwhile, four young girls stood behind the counter just chitchatting while half of the restaurant was empty.  It didn't make sense that people had to wait so long to be seated.  Additionally, when new customers came in, they didn't know they were supposed to check in and proceeded to an empty table.  Then someone would finally tell them they had to wait, which made everyone confused Becsuse of the open tables and lack of professionalism behind the check in counter.
My sweet tooth led my boyfriend and I here after dinner on a Friday evening. Well, the good news - we weren't sugar bombed. The bad news - It was totally watered down. . . I was disappointed with the Frozen Hot Chocolate; I was really expecting it to taste like chocolate - rich and luscious. Can you blame me? Unfortunately, it was overly icy and the chocolate flavor was super mellow, watered down with a slight hint of sweetness. The massive amount of whipped cream on top was the sweetest part of the entire drink, but that's not saying much since the ratio of ice overpowered every other flavor we tasted. . . The "regular" $13 sized original frozen hot chocolate was shared between my boyfriend and I just fine. For us, it was the right amount. They also had a size "for two" $17, but I'm glad we didn't opt for the larger size. It was bland, watery and not memorable. . . I would say the best part of the experience  was sipping the same cup as my date, it was really cute and romantic. So if you're not looking to be wow'ed by flavor or quality, I would suggest taking your date here for some cute ol' romance and that's about it - I don't see myself making my way out there for any other reason. . . They also serve appetizers, lunch, dinner, shakes, splits, sundaes, coffee and other desserts which all looked average to me. . . Pro tip: they sell hello kitty mini beanie babies here for about $10 (and change) each
I dinned here for the frozen hot chocolate, I was intrigued on how this would taste and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this really was. It was not overly sweet and tasted like hot chocolate frozen. The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean. My husband ordered the club sandwich, it tasted fresh like the meat was just sliced and the portion was the right size for the price. I ordered the taco salad, it came out neat with taqitos sticking out. The taco salad was good, not the best ive had but good. The staff was friendly and attentive which sets the tone for my meals, I am big on customer service and feel other than the quality of food the type of service is what is going to aid into weather i would go again. This is defiantly a place i would go back to, not sure if i would order the taco salad again, but there is other stuff on the menu id like to try.
Everytime I'm in Vegas, I make it a mission to stop by here.  I just like how fun and friendly it looks inside and outside.  I love theircrabcake sandwich and their triple decker grilled cheese with tomato bisque.  There's something about their tomato bisque that makes my stomach happy. Their food is comforting and fun.  It is a bit expensive here but I'm on vacation so why not splurge a little.  I haven't been to the NYC location but I hope it's the same as the one in Vegas.
A great alternative if you haven't been able to visit the original Serendipity in NY. I love the cute decor inside! Though the Frozen Hot Chocolate isn't exactly the same as Serendipity3 in NY, it's still pretty good!
The 4 stars mainly went to the server (I think his name is Dave - some tall guy with a ton of tattoos) my 2 friends and I were going to order 2 frozen hot chocolates, a sundae, and a carrot cake but then Dave said it was going to be a lot of food for 3 girls... However I really wanted carrot cake (which he said was huge) he recommended the carrot cake sundae and to just have the carrot cake (a slice that's smaller than the order) on the side. We went with the sundae and 1 order of frozen hot chocolate. The sundae came out and it was massive and my slice of carrot cake was huge, I couldn't even finish it. I'm so glad he told us about the portions because it would have gone to waste.
Rarely do such popular places combine poor food, poor service and lack of value.    This place has all three. The famed frozen hot chocolate was essentially a Wendy's shake.   The dining area was cluttered. The service however was the absolute worst from greeter to service.  They were miserable.  Stay away!!!!
I went here for dessert with my girls and it was DELICIOUS!! we ended up sharing the deep fried oreo sunday and it was really big, the three of us had just gotten out of a show for the convention we were at in cesars palace ( so convenient  to walk from the hotel) we didnt make a reservation but were sat within 10 minutes which was really nice. right after we were sat there were a few different larger parties that checked in and it didn't seem like they waited too long either but I would definitely suggest a reservations because the place isn't huge and I imagine it can get fairly busy. the ice cream sunday was big enough for all of us to share and still not finish the entire thing. the fried oreos were warm and delish not too much fried coating which was nice sometimes they can get really thick and over bearing. but it was a good contrast with the ice cream. definitely will be back
Mold covered beer bottle...my boyfriend is a local and takes me to S3 every time I visit. It was my friends 30th bday and we decided to take her there for brunch on Saturday. Service was lackluster and food came out cold...the worst moment when my boyfriend ordered a second beer...an expensive beer...and it was covered in MOLD! He immediately went to ask for manager and did not like what he saw in the kitchen...we received our food for free but unfortunately that experience ruined the mood...makes you wonder what else is moldy in that place...bummer.
Horrible Service and I would've totally gave more stars if their so called famous desserts was anywhere decent, but IT WASNT !!! YUCk! Specialty Drinks.... YUCK! Seriously it's only good for picture taking other then that.... STAY CLEAR!
Bad service! Waited over an hour and all we ordered desert. Ruined my friends bday! Had over ten people and they only brought out six plates. At first they didn't even bring plates. We was so hungry we started to eat food that we had in our bags and the manager swiftly ran out and yelled at us. But still no desert! No bueno, no plates, no desert and we still waiting for the check. Ordered the $93 treasure chest desert and it was mushy and not good. Would never come here again!!
The only reason they are getting two stars is because the portions are huge. Other than that, the place is overrated. From the time we sat down, it took 40 minutes to get some of our food- my husband and I waited another 15 minutes to receive ours. The food wasn't great- it was OK. The only reason we came here was because we found a groupon. Unfortunately I felt like it was a waste of money. There are much much better places on the strip to grab breakfast.
I would give this place a 2.5 . I went here with my boyfriend just to try it out because we've never been, but we've always heard about it. We didn't need a reservation and we didn't have to wait because it is less busy on Mondays.. . We looked at the menu and was surprised on how expensive everything was. Nothing was very appetizing from what I read in the descriptions of the food items. I was craving some tomato soup so I got one. My boyfriend ordered the frozen hot chocolate and burger combo.. . The frozen hot chocolate was good.  If you love whipped cream and chocolate Frappuccinos then I'm sure you'd enjoy this.. . The creamy tomato soup was okay. It tasted more like pasta/marinara sauce. It was not creamy at all. . . The ABC burger was horrible.  The bun was burnt and so was the burger. I could not eat this. I like a little charbroiled flavor but this was too much. I looked at the burger and the bottom was all black! I don't like complaining about the food so I didnt. But that burger needed to go straight to the trash.  Definitely not worth almost 20 bucks.  Plus none of the toppings were mind blowing. . . The service was good. I found it so interesting that the Togo area next door is so much cheaper than the restaurant. Maybe next time I'll just try that. . . I wouldn't go back here.
This place is pretty forgettable. Yeah, the frozen hot chocolate is pretty delicious, shockingly sugary and a perfect blend of icy and creamy, but oh man, the food is so bland.  Their food is on par with Chili's but double the price!  I probably ordered the worst nachos ever here. All the toppings were on the top including the cheese and if I tried to pick up one chip, I got one big clump. Thenwhen I ate all the "good parts" I had a fat dish of plain chips.  All their food is in huge servings and unfortunately, not really that memorable in flavor. PASS. Just go to the window and get a dessert drink to go! I highly recommend the peanut butter one.
We went for the frozen hot chocolate and their giant cheesecake. Needless to say we left with a gut ache and couldn't look at sweets for a few days. It was good, but not on the greatness scale we were hoping for. The cheesecake crumbled and wasn't very creamy. It was a bit on the dry side. The frozen hot chocolate tasted almost like pure Hershey's syrup blended with ice. For being on the strip the prices were average. Not yummy enough for us to go back. Check it off your vegas bucket list and move on.
Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.
Cute place...but a little pricey...I had the "hangover" omelette $18. This was an omelette with french fries, bacon and cheese. It was okay...once I added the hotsauce. lol...I have had better omelettes other places....The service was mediocre...
We absolutely love to enjoy not only the famous frozen hot chocolate, but the delectable entrees as well. Its worth the wait!  Check it out.
We had a small wedding reception at Serendipity 3.  The food was great - we opted to go with buffet stations and there was tons of wonderful options.  Everyone was incredibly impressed with the crab legs and pasta stations.  We also had a cake through Caesar's that was beautifully light and delicious.  The ice cream station was a huge hit as well.. . The servers who worked with us at the event were prompt, polite, and lovely, and really made for a smooth evening.  We were seated on the patio which gave us a fantastic view of the busy Strip.  Kimberley Patterson worked with us on the booking and was so helpful and kind throughout.  A really great experience and we would recommend it to anyone.  Thanks!
This popular facsimile of the iconic New York outpost is a tourist trap, no doubt about it. But it's a trap that is still fun to take the kids. Desserts are the main draw here, with plenty of frozen hot chocolate and sundae options available. Portion sizes for desserts and all other food are huge, so sharing is the best option.. . Dessert was the main reason my son and I stopped by, but we knew we had to eat some real food for dinner before indulging in sweets. The crab cake sandwich ($19) was massive.  A jumbo lump crab cake with a tolerable amount of filler was topped with beefsteak tomatoes, avocado, and an orange aioli. Those savory items with hints of sweetness sat in between an unusually large bun. The only ways to eat it are to smash it down to fit in your mouth or grab a knife and fork and eat it one small piece at a time. An order of the kid's chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague. He wasn't crazy about the chicken either. Suffering from a hard breading covering dry meat, he barely finished half his meal. . . Moving on to what we both viewed as the "main course" we quickly agreed on the red velvet sundae ($14). Substituting chocolate for the vanilla ice cream listed on the menu, the massive dessert served in a goblet had a large chunk of moist and dense cake stuck to one side with hot fudge, whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles topping it all. It was plenty satisfying, but far from refined. The quality doesn't warrant the hefty price tag as it's a dessert that one can replicate at home for far less.. . 2.5 Stars
Love this place!! Of course, the location in NYC has much more character, but the LV location still has that whimsical feel. Brought my husband for his first Serendipity experience and he really liked it- the atmosphere and the food. I had the crab cake sandwich and he had a burger. Both were delicious! Love Serendipity 3!!!
The food here is average... The portions are very large. The price is kind of high. I will come back for dessert,  but that's it. Even at about 20$, the ice cream sundae I had here was good enough to come backfor- although I could just as well buy the ingredients and make it at home for less. Also,  being on the Strip, it's very crowded and full of tourists
I didn't realize I ordered somthing with blue cheese and I thought what the he'll I'll give it a go.... The BBQ Blue cheese burger is so delicious And the fries with ranch  are amazing. Service is in point to... Over all 1st time experience is a TEN.
This place will likely never recieve my business again. Seating and hostesses are critical to the first impression of an establishment and this place was subpar in that aspect. Our experience started off on the wrong foot when we were seated outside in a corner in the blazing sun when there was plenty of seating inside and outside that weren't in the sun. I asked if we can move to a table at least out of the sub and the hostess told us the rest of the tables were for bigger parties than 2.....shortly after we sat down the hostess brought parties of 2 to those tables that I asked about. I was disgusted at this type of treatment and after my meal I went to ask her.  She said that those tables had been reserved. I can definitely understand that but why didn't she say that in the beginning rather than say it's for bigger parties? She also had an aloof attitude that I didn't appreciate. I asked to speak to the manager and she offered to take 20% off the bill AFTER I had to ask for it some sort of rectification. I've always been impressed with the establishments on the Caesars property so I was surprised I was treated that way here. . . As for the food it was decent but reallyoverpriced.  You are paying for the novelty.
Barrrffff... Service was friendly but that was about it. I'm going to keep this short because the entire experience was a waste of time and money! I Ordered a barbecue blue cheeseburger with fries a side salad and a frozen hot chocolate for 2. The burger was ok, the plain jane salad was literally lettuce, a half slice of tomato, and 5 cubes of cucumber. The frys were soggy and half cooked and the frozen hot chocolate was not so frozen,  more like soup!  OH, AND NOT TO MENTION A ICE TEA COSTS $5!!! WTF... NEVER AGAIN!!!
If you go here - go hungry or split a meal.   A breakfast + coffee will probably cost around $25.  It took about 40 minutes to get served after being seated - so don't go if you're in a rush.. . That said the breakfast was delicious and filling.
Having read the Serendipity cookbook and history, my daughter and I decided to stop by for lunch.  We didn't read the reviews prior to coming.  I had the Asian chicken salad.  Over dressed, absolutely huge and the chicken was so dry I didn't each most of it.  Daughter had a the vegetable pizza - ok she said but nothing you couldn't get somewhere else for 1/2 the price.  Our server was really good but for the food/experience - wouldn't recommend it.
Fun place, good desserts.  Been to the one in NYC Liked it better.  Seemed they made better desserts.  Nevertheless I ordered the monster banana split and it was huge.  Enough to feed at least 6 people.  . . Lots of fun great atmosphere for small and large groups.
I took my first trip to Vegas and was so- excited to try this restaurant out.  I have always wanted one of their frozen hot chocolates.  I luckily found a groupon which was even better.  First the service was sub par.  They had 3 hostesses that stand around. They also do not have bathrooms in the restaurant.  You have to go outside walk around and then go down into this "cave".   Then the public restroom was gross and reminded me of nasty public park toilets (they are metal toilets). It took about 20-30 minutes once seated just to get our water! The house salad was mediocre.  Their balsamic was ok.  My friend and I both got burgers.  I got the ABC burger because that is what the waiter said was their good one and it was the blandest thing ever.  I didn't even eat half of it.  The burger had no seasoning, the had no seasoning, and they didn't put condiments on it.   They have a lot of fries already made up so they were not the best and luke warm.  We did have their romano cheese onion rings.  Those were WONDERFUL.  I would totally eat those again.  My friend and I also shared a frozen hot chocolate.  It was ok.  I make them at home with real chocolate but the one here tasted like it had a slight powder taste.  I probably would have liked it better if I never had made my own to get that true delicious chocolate taste.  All in all I will not be back to eat, but maybe grab the onion rings to go.
i have never been this disappointed with my meal my entire life!. . my mom came to las vegas for vacation & we walked around the caesar's palace to shop. i decided to take my mom in this place because as of my previous experience here, i was able to enjoy their desserts (although a little pricey) & pizza.. first, they had us wait for 15mins to be seated, even if i saw a lot of empty tables around, still i kept my cool down. then, we ordered a steak, to be cooked medium, and a frozen hot chocolate. for that 2 meals it took them 45mins to serve us food!!! we were so hungry & the server was apologetic enough to convince me to wait. . . then when the steak came out it was so stiff and cooked well-done, blunt flavored! it's like someone just decided to throw a steak in a grill, left it there for 30mins and tossed-served it to us!!!. i will never go back here again!!! save your money
I went here for my birthday dinner when we were on vacation in Las Vegas.  I was immediately pulled in by the giant and colorful lamp that can be seen from the strip.  The staff made me feel very special, by taking a photo of my party, and the overall fast service. I recommend this place to anyone who will be visiting Las Vegas, or live there. Its a delight!
The frozen hot chocolate is the best! A definite way to cool down from the hot Vegas weather!
A good dessert place to chill. The patio area is really nice. Employees aren't the best though.
We had high hopes as many friends told us this place was great. Maybe they were having an off day. Hubby ordered they eggs benedict (this is what everyone was raving about) and they were extremely salty. I ordered the boring old breakfast quesadilla. I mean boring as it's just what it says on the menu but I don't know how they cook the bacon or if it's a particular type but it was also extremely salty. The servers were very pleasant and the atmosphere was comfortable. It looks like they have a great dessert menu, maybe next time we will just try that.
We love to share the meals and enjoy watching the people and will definitely be back.. The service is not the fastest but well worth the wait.
A little pricey, but it's at Caesar's so, but we had so much fun! I took my Mother, 3 kids, & a gf for a birthday celebration...we took lots of great pics, since it's right on the Strip. Food was wonderful, drinks were fine, but the frozen hot chocolate was to die for! We will definitely go back & that's from a Native local!!
The wait was very long, very dirty cups and the waiter seemed upset to swap them out.  Both my friends had hair in their food!  This place is so dirty stay away
This restaurant was interesting to say the least. The food was decent for the price. While a bit pricey, the food was cooked the way we asked for it but still a bit bland. My boyfriend ordered the Las Vegas Strip sandwich, which was French bread, steak, eggs, and bacon. You would think it would be awesome, but according to him it was just "ok." I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, which came with cold unseasoned chicken (dressing was good but again just ok for an $18 salad). Service was great, and desserts looked phenomenal- a place for dinner? Not my first choice.
Fun food - fun place! If you are getting a sundae, make sure to have at least 5 people to share one or you will be sorry. If you only have two people, you will both eat more than you should because they are freaking delicious and you will feel like crap!
All I had heard was that I had to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate here while in Vegas. My last trip I wasn't able to fit it in, but this time I got to check if off the list. Came in on a Tuesday morning so wasn't a wait at all. The other breakfast food items looked good but massive as the servers brought them out to adjacent tables. . . My friend and I both independently decided on the Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and reasoned that it was cheaper to order the "For Two" sized portion of the same flavor. It was a huge glass/bowl, and about 1/3 was just whipped cream. The frozen hot chocolate itself was very minty, and I did like the touch of Andes mints on top. It was refreshing, cool especially after walking around the Strip in 80 degree weather, and not too frozen that it was hard to drink through the straw. The spoons provided we mostly used to tackle the whipped cream, haha. . . That was the only item we got off the menu since I had to get to the airport soon after, and all I can say is wowzers...calorie-wise that was pretty much my breakfast and lunch allocation in one sitting. Seriously, 850 calories in a "for one" serving! Gosh. Maybe next time I'll try Max Brenner since I missed that chance in Boston as well.
The frozen hot chocolate was a nice treat on a hot evening, but $11 for a 16 oz. drink that wasn't nearly as good as a standard Frappuccino...probably won't be back.
YUMMMMM!. . I came here for the frozen hot chocolate that everyone talks about.  We didn't sit inside- I was totally fine sitting outside with no wait.  It was hot of course, in the middle of July, but there were misters spraying water in the seating area.. . I paid $11 for a frozen hot chocolate.  It was rich and chocolaty and cold and satisfied my craving!  It tasted exactly like frozen hot chocolate.  It was delish!. . I will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas!
Before coming here I was warned not to eat inside as Service was really slow. Well, seeing that I'm from England (renowned for slow crappy service) that didn't bother me but I do have to agree it was a little slow, nothing bad enough to irritate me yet took around 15 minutes from us being ready to order for someone to come over and then roughly 20 minutes once we were done to get our check.. . With that said, I was really excited to come and eat here and came at just after 8am. Hubby and I decided to order just one entree as I planned to have the Mint Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate - $13 as my Breakfast. Yes, Really.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#TRbbI2waOPt8MckXWqWCuQ) He choose the Crescentwich which I had a small amount of and where the place is cute we both came to the conclusion that it is severely overpriced. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#ONQT8eOiIEaClhkXjN9Dnw). The Crescentwich was really not worth $16. It was good but not to the point I would pay that much for it again and the Potatoes that came with it were cold and hard. Server didn't even check back to make sure everything was ok so we didn't have the chance to have it corrected.. . As for the Chocolate... meh. I expected something amazing seeing that the Server bragged that it was ''made with a blend of 11 different types of Chocolate''. It tasted watery with little Mint flavor and very icy, I was so bummed as I was expecting this delicious rich Chocolate. That didn't happen. I won't be back.
Omg I hadn't had a Serendipity frozen hot chocolate in decades and what a delicious treat!  They now have tons of flavors but I went with the classic. Soooo yummy. Thanks for the yummy nostalgia. I may need to have one of these every day I'm here. Sooo highly recommend.
Good stuff great food awesome atmosphere love the restaurant I will be back. A must to if you're feeling up for dessert.
