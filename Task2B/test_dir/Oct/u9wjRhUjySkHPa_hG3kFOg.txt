I've been meaning to review the Wynn Hotel and Casino, but I've been procrastinating.  My wife and I stayed at the Wynn in late December 2012 for our honeymoon.  . . This place is the bomb.  Everything from the opening of our door until the time we checked out was spot on.  We couldn't have asked for a better stay.. We had one of the corner suites that faced the Palazzo and TI, on the 55th floor.  What an amazing view we had of the entire strip.  The interior design and everything in it's place definitely impressed us (I'll add some pictures to my review to show you).. . We aren't big gamblers, so I can't really speak for the casino, although it was large and pretty busy, I can't begin to assume knowing how great the casino is.. . Played a round of golf at the course, and although $500 for 18 holes in incredulous, I figured, once in my life is worth it.  Great course, well manicured.  I was paired up with another single player and our forecaddie (can't remember his name, but he was great).  Played in around 3 hours, no holdups on the course.  The fairways and greens were very well manicured and completely enjoyed my round of golf.  Afterwards, they cleaned up my shoes, put my bag in storage for me and were supposed to provide me with a bag tag, but it was not included, they followed up with me later and mailed me a replacement.. . The room service was adequate, although not spectacular, but I cannot take away a star because of one person having a bad day, we are all entitled.  He wasn't rude in any way, but just not talkative or over friendly.. . If it wasn't for the fact that we try to stay in a different hotel every Vegas visit, I would definitely come back.  You won't be disappointed staying at the Wynn.
The manager privately message me and gave us a buffet credit back which was nice of him!  I gave them one star extra for now and if we do ever go back?  If my husband will?  I hope next time their service and dinning will be better!  Thank you!
What a beautiful hotel/casino. My wife and I recently had a chance to stay at the Wynn for a few nights. We both love Vegas and have probably stayed at 8 or 9 of the hotels on the strip. From a purely aesthetic view, the Wynn is the best we've stayed at with the Bellagio a close second. Everything from the check-in experience until we left was first class. Lots of great dining experience. If I was going to be critical in any area, it would be that it's a bit pricey - but they don't need to apologize for that. You definitely get what you pay for. All in all, just a beautiful place.
Apparently, there's a difference in crowds who patronize either the Wynn or Encore. . . A few people were surprised we booked at the Wynn because it's usually an older crowd and the younger people book their stay at Encore. It's all the same to me but I guess the biggest difference would be that most of the clubs are more accessible from the Encore side.
6 years ago, we stepped foot in the Wynn and decided that it's one of our favorite hotels in Las Vegas. Then the Encore opened up and it was hard since they're sister hotels, but I think the Wynn still has more charm than Encore does. . . This place is beautiful, the hotel rooms are huge and the buffet is delicious (a bit pricier during the holidays, we came during Christmas week), and the Reve is a great show to catch. . . Unfortunately, my husband favors the Mandarin Oriental more now so it's hard to convince him to stay here again. Though I can say our room made us feel like a king and queen for the week. The sink-in tub.is.amazing. THAT IS ALL.
Really really nice hotel and casino I love it is my 4th time in vegas this has been by far the best! I also had $1000 gambling money and end up with $4700 wich is super cool I just won $300 + at this casino and hotel but the stay the bed, swimming, host etc... best in vegas thank you!
Stunning stay experience my husband and I had during a long weekend. Wynn's every nook and corner is simply gorgeous. Rooms are spacious, and calm decor. When it comes to food, I just can't stop ranting about it, simply out of the world, all their restaurants are worth trying and you will not be disappointed. The biggest highlight of my stay was the stunning "le reve the dream" show. That show gives a once in a life time experience! In our next visit, it's definitely our choice of hotel to stay!
From a holistic point of view, this is still by far my favorite hotel/casino in Vegas.. . Let me count the reasons .... . 1. The decor is fantastic.  I love the beautiful garden/atrium once you walk in.  Even the fake flower smell pumped in the air has some kind of relaxing appeal.. . 2. The service here has always been solid.  The folks at the reception desk are friendly and generally the staff is very helpful.. . 3. The rooms are minimalist and tastefully modern.  I was lucky enough on my most recent visit to get a room on one of the highest floors in the hotel and the view was phenomenal.  Even though I was facing west (instead of the main strip to the south), I was still overwhelmed by the great view of the surrounding landscape and had a good view of old strip to the north.  . . 4. The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable.  I had by best sleep ever in Vegas by far here (and I've stayed in the following - Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Caesars, and the old Sahara).. . 5. Even though the table games and slots are expensive I enjoyed playing here because the atmosphere isn't that smoky and the crowd isn't that loud/rowdy. . . 6. The Wynn Buffet is still my favorite in all of Vegas, along with Caesars and Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs here are still the best in Vegas IMO and even though they don't have a HUGE amount of variety compared to other places the quality of each individual item is solid.  I also love the dessert section here.. . The only real drawback is that this place is about a 20 min walk from the Bellagio/Caesars area and that the rooms can be pricey.  But it's worth it for what what you get and also the benefit of not getting as much annoying traffic here as you do in mid-strip.
Excellent food and service!
No other hotel in Vegas screams of class. Oh they try to imitate, but none exude the level of exclusive chic that is Wynn.. . From plush flowers.... EVERYWHERE..... to some of the best restaurants (especially Asian..... of all sorts... Southeast Asian, Japanese, Chinese..), and one of the hottest clubs on the Strip, this really is one of the few hotels that has the UC-factor.... you know... ultra-cool... (yes... I know I just made that up.... but seriously.... soooo ultra-cool... soooo UC!!). . One of the things I especially love about this is the hotel floor design. The place never seems to reach the level of chaotic frenzy on crazy check-in/out times. Yes there are times when it fills up like any other place, but it always seems to move, and nobody really complains like they do at Paris, MGM, or Bellagio, where the check-in line crashes with the main entrance so it always feels like a zoo... but with more smelly people.. . While the hotel has a couple of great clubs (XS and Tryst), it doesn't have the feel of 24/7 frenziness that, say, Cosmopolitan has (don't get me wrong, I love the Cosmo too..... but that place is a boner factory).. . Class and ass. There. I called it. . . Class and ass.
This hotel is a class act.  The steak house restaurant with a show is spectacular if you sit outside in the garden where the waterfall is.   The buffet is spectacular and the best in Vegas!   You will also enjoy the sandwich shop in the center of the casino next to the Italian restaurant.  The coffee shop at the Encore is very good.. . The rooms are superb, clean and quiet.  You never hear the maids outside talking and banging their brooms.  They have suites in the tower that are amazing.. . I am a gambler and do very well on the slots.  They are generous.  On two occasions I have won $33,000.00.  In the casino you do not see low lives walking around or hear super loud music that can drive you crazy.  Service is superb.. . The beautiful thing about the Wynn is that people dress up for dinner or to play the tables.  I hope we continue this.  It reminds me of the old days.  You will not see drunks falling down.  They have amazing security and they kick them out as fast has they come in.  You feel safe.   FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!
Although the rooms here are smaller than the Palazzo/Venetian they are significantly better. The corner suite I stayed at on the top floor (Floor 60) had epic views of the strip. The room was spacious and it was appointed with an ultra-comfy bed. This is the place to stay in Vegas.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #15:. cha-ching is not the sound of slot machines, it's the sound of how much money you can spend here!; The Wynn is ultra-fabulous and high end; the first thing you see coming from the parking garage is the Ferrari dealer/store; the shopping corridor is a who's who of high-end name brands (with very few shoppers inside); the restaurants are all beautiful and make you stop and gaze; the only good moderately-priced eating spot appears to be Zoozacrackers deli; the sports book is big & classy; you can hear a pin drop in the large poker room; beautiful outdoor grounds with a huge lagoon and lots of waterfalls; this includes some weird-ass performance deals at night - I saw a giant mechanical frog singing a country song over the waterfall (at least I think I saw this - I had been drinking); there is also a huge & classy wing of ballrooms & meeting rooms; best craft beer bet = it's surprisingly pretty lousy (I guess rich people drink crappy beer), but the bar next to the sports book has a few good selections in bottles only
Everything about this place is amazing. Yet the security staff is horrible enough to take 3 full stars off my review. If you see a purple jacket, walk the other way before you start getting harassed. (exceptions are Bruno, Daryl, Devon and a few additional gems, only need 1 hand to count them all.)
Hotel rooms are very clean and modern. Room service is the best on the strip. The casino is not my favorite. Beautiful spa and work out facilities. I highly recommend an airbrush tan by Melissa. Incredible job! I recommend making reservations at the country club and going for the fixed menu of the season.
Super nice hotel! Everything was great here except their super packed fridge that I couldn't even fit anything into.. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a fridge in the room if I can't put stuff in it. IT was filled with their stuff. Other than that, everything was great. Kind of far from the center of everything but I can't complain.
