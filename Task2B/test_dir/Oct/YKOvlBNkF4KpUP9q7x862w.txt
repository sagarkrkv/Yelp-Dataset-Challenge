I looked up the review on this restataunt so tried it out. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. This place was great from the cucumber jalapeno margarita to the table side guacamole. You have to also orderer the corn off the cob. The atmosphere is killer.  Sit outside if you can by the big fireplace.
As a disclaimer, I was here for an event so I'm not sure how it is on a regular night, but wow did I ever have fun! We were greeted by friendly staff and directed to the tequila tasting, then to the bar for our complimentary beverage. The drink was delicious, with well balanced flavours and a boozy kick that didn't overpower the taste completely. There was a dried chili in my drink that I was exceptionally tempted to eat, but I think I would likely have no tongue left had I done that!. . I was introduced to some lovely people at the event, and spent some time chatting and enjoying the atmosphere; The Mission has a very carefully balanced feel that straddles the line between hip and old world in a charming and successful way. . . There were some unreasonably delicious snacks served too - crunchy tortilla chips with a salsa that tasted like it had been roasted and sprinkled with fairy dust, and the best guacamole of my life. No joke. Locals likely have a lot more experience than I do, but as a Brit who moved to Vancouver I haven't experienced a lot that have blown my socks off. Now, I wasn't wearing socks the night I went to The Mission, but when I got home all of my socks were in disarray; I think you get the picture! The guac was rich, creamy, and incredibly fresh tasting with a plethora of yummy tastes that all danced together in a happy boogie. Go try it immediately! . . I had a look at the full menu after the event as I was hungry for more Latin food, but I found most of the prices to be quite expensive. I'll be back for sure, but it will definitely be a special treat!
I'm not sure how a place that has "loud" "energetic" and "vibrant" in almost every review decides that MY party was the loud one, but being threatened to be kicked out of a restaurant is not how my dinners usually go.. . Yep. the food is good, if overpriced.. . Yep, we had a couple of cocktails.. . But we were seated in the BAR-clearly the noisiest part of the entire building and my friend was approached in the BATHROOM (really?) by the manager and told we needed to quiet down. Same manager came to our table a bit later and told us that he had received complaints about our noise level and that we needed to decide if we were going to quiet down and stay, or "shake hands and part friends right now". WOW-pretentious much???. . If I'd had a gaggle of bubble-headed Scottsdale Barbies with me maybe I'd have no reason to make a complaint, but the youngest person in my "party" was 32 and the oldest 80...how noisy could we have been???. . So, thanks for buzzkilling my birthday party.
The kale salad with chicken was disappointing. It's a pile of shaved kale without much else. The chicken is tasty, but there isn't much on there. All things considered, I think the food is overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
Yum
We came here for a nice lunch during a weekend trip from Chicago. We sat on the beautiful back patio. We ordered tableside guacamole as well as the pork and fish tacos. They were great!! Our server was Angel, who was so kind and attentive. He gave us great recommendations on both margarita and food choices. We couldn't have asked for better service. By the far the best Mexican food we've had in Arizona! Angel also raved about their brunches where they smoke a whole pig and everyone can make their own tacos - which sounded great. Would definitely come back for brunch, lunch, or dinner!
This place was amazing, I could not complain from food to drinks everything was good fresh and flavorful !!!!!!
One of the best restaurants we have ever been to! Service, drinks and food were excellent and exceeded our expectations. We will def. be back on our next trip to AZ.
I often feel higher priced Mexican restaurants or overrated (why go expensive when you can go to filibertos?? ;);)) but the mission took mexican food to another level... maybe it was the ginger cilantro margarita and flights of tequila that made it all taste so good... but I was in taco guacamole heaven. We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good. . The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm!. We got the expresso soaked churros for. dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad. However, the fried bananas were to die for and came with a peanut butter mousse that made me catch my breath... :):) Back Patio was nice except we were seated next to a huge fan.... bleh. kind of an ambience killer, but the food made up for it.
First I will apologize for the dark photos, but this place is UNLIT. Just factual, but a close friend in the restaurant biz once said, "Don't eat anything you can't see". She would never eat here, I guess. Waiters have a pocket light for your use, though. For menu, not food (unless you want that). I am probably a lot more forgiving of small portions because of all my NYC meals. The quality of every ingredient here was top-notch. We started with wings, eight wing tip only pieces, in a spicy sweet sauce. Perfect cook on the wings but not much for the money. Flavor was yummy, so we forgave the size. We needed room anyways. We had the pork shoulder tacos for two. One issue, it came with this TINY tray of cheese, cilantro and onion.  Like a tablespoon of each. For ten tacos. The homemade taco shells were 3" in diameter. You got ten of these for two people. The delicious sauce was supplied in ONE small dish. Not everyone likes sharing dirty spoons, so my biggest suggestion would be two servings of toppings and sauce for the $32 price, I mean really. Its sounding negative but I will tell you this, the pork shoulder meat, fork tender, was the single best piece of the pig I have ever had. Worth every cent. We had lots left over. No toppings left, because well, most stuck to the spoon. The pumpkin bread pudding was good, lots of crunchy bits that we couldn't see so was worrisome at times. This is AZ, you know. The street corn is also worth the visit. Spicy and hot with cheese and sauce soaking it. You have to try this. So, my advice to make tis the best night EVER, have lots of money in your pocket and no bills due. Sit outside and book early (you will need reservations which you can make on their website), and ask for extra toppings if you need them, do not be shy. And do not waste this place on a so-so date. Save it for "the one".  Great wait staff, really A-1.
I came here around 9pm this past Thursday night. I was annoyed because after waiting 45 minutes, the hostess said we would be seated in a few minutes, but she forgot about us. After another 15 minutes, we went back again to the desk after seeing other parties seated ahead of us, and they realized they forgot and quickly sat us at a table inside that was empty for the entire time we were standing there. Hungry and frustrated after 1 hour, I'm docking them 1 star.. . Once we were seated, the food was great. The elote corn was really good, it was this sweet cream butter (tasted almost like caramel) on top of the cob, cut in half. The crispy pork with cola lime glaze was also really good- little pieces of juicy pork, sweet with a nice smear of this nutty paste inside a lettuce wrap. These were the 2 best dishes I would get again.. . The guacamole was pretty standard, they put garlic, lemon, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and some cheese on top. They only use one avocado, for $12 I didn't think it was worth it. The mission fries were skinny fries served with two sauces- we couldn't finish this, but they were good fries and filling.. . I'll probably come back for the food, but hope the front desk service improves or they start taking reservations.
The Mission is an upscale Mexican place with a great atmosphere and ambiance.  We waited for a table at the bar and while waiting ordered a bottle of "Slingshot" Cabernet.  The wine was quite good and our wait was short.  . . We headed out to a small table outside (the only downfall was that the tree was shedding leaves a bit).  The weather was perfect and the service was even better.  We had the table side guacamole for an appetizer and it was delicious.  . . I had the Florida Grouper for dinner and the boyfriend had the Chorizo Porchetta.  The plates were beautifully decorated (I know that's not important...) and the food was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The Grouper was perfectly seared and the Porchetta had a delicious flavor of their chorizo.  . . We were too full to order dessert but the dinner was just plain delicious.  A++. Perfect date night.
How does anyone consider this over-priced slop good Mexican food. May want to try actually going to MX or just come out to NYC.
This place epitomizes the word overrated. . . The food was a bit too "fusion" for my taste. We ordered the scallops, grouper and duck confit, and all were underwhelming. Too many flavors going on, no cohesion. We also ordered the skirt steak tacos. The handmade tortillas were quite good, but the steak tasted smokey, almost like bacon. Nothing like I thought or was described. . . Our waitress seemed like she just started working there. Whenever we asked her questions, she answered awkwardly with hesitation. At the end of our meal, she didn't ask us if we liked the food. I'm surprised that she is working in fine dining. Seems like she would be better fit at a sports bar.. . Maybe I am spoiled from living in Portland, but, overall, I would not recommend this place.
Swanky ambiance, pretty waitresses and the place was packed. That's usually a good sign. Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the nachos at Bootleggers down the block while waiting for our table. The food at the mission did not come together for any of us. I had the duck confit with mole .... It was weird. More like fried chicken with overly sweet plum sauce. The meals were a little too all over the place for my liking. Drinks were ok. Very overrated and underwhelming. "Broken plate concepts" for sure...
We went for Dinner there on wednesday night and I have to say it was one thebetter experiences I have had. . The restaurant is part of an existing mission on the left. The interior is just the way I love it, dark, cozy and cool.. We chose the outside patio, since the weather was perfect. our waitress Nicole was courteous, knowledgeable and gave us advice on the drinks and the food.. We started with spicy margarita, fresh lime juice, good tequila, agava and a dash of jalepeno. Yummi - but be careful, they are strong!. We shared an appetizer of Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze - excellent.. For dinner I had the Grouper, which was a near perfect 10. My friend had Salmon which was great as well.. We enjoyed some white wine from Austria - great recommendation by Nicole.. The one thing we did not eat, but wished we did, was the table side guacamole. Oh well next time, since I will be back for sure.
Not quite sure where to begin. One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food,Service, and owner were unbelievable. The best trained staff I have seen in a long time. The spice combinations the chef uses are phenomenal.  This is a must stop if near here. We had everything from duck to the filet ..... Unbelievable.
Restaurant is beautiful. Food can be pricey but is very good. Service was okay. I Recommend a reservation.
