I've been coming and going to Vegas since I was 6 years old...as a kid, Excalibur was the coolest hotel in the world to me...now as an adult, I've never had more fun at a hotel.. . Just the gadgetry in the room kept us entertained for a solid hour, flipping on and off the lights with the touchpad, goofing around with the curtains using the switches on the wall, and testing to see if the master turn off switch really turned everything off...I was a kid in a candy shop!. . I lost who knows how much on the blackjack tables, but made it all back at the Craps tables.. . The hotel staff was better than most and the security guards were on top of checking the room keys which made me feel better about keeping my bikes in my room.. . As expected, the fridge was booby trapped with a 30 second switch, so we couldn't keep our drinks in the fridge. The view from my room was pretty epic as well. We woke up to seeing hot air balloons taking off towards the red rock mountains with the sunrise reflecting back the solid orange and reddish hues. Good Stuff.. . I posted a picture of the view from our room. Not bad at all. Overall, it maybe, just maybe as cool to me as an adult as Excalibur was to me as a kid.
Aria Hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in LV..  Their Sky Suits rank some of the best in the category.  The amenities are fantastic and room service is best in class. Aria Hotel is my new go to when in Vegas!
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 10 days in May. This was our first time to Vegas and we were excited! As soon as we exited our shuttle, the bell person offered to hold our bags if we couldn't check in immediately. As we walked in to check in, it was a little confusing because we weren't sure where to go. Everyone at the desk had 'Check Out' above them (we were there before 8 am). But we stood in line and we were able to check in early (Score!!). In regards to the incidental deposit we were able to void charging privileges and have our deposit at $200 for the stay instead of the $130/day deposit. Check in took between 5-10 minutes and we were on our way. . . There is someone checking for room keys before you can get to the elevators. And every 7 floor, I believe, had a separate bank of elevators (6 elevators), so wait time was very minimal. The hallways are pretty long and we were towards the end of hallway but nothing unmanageable. . . The room was beautiful and the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. The room for the most part was clean, however we did find a Starbucks stirrer on the floor. And twice throughout our stay, the maid did not replace our used toiletries, which is the reason for docking one star. We also never received turn down service even though we requested it.. . The 10 days there was amazing and we can't wait to return!
I would rate this as one of the upper echelon hotel and casinos on the strip, easily. Beautiful wall waterfall on the outside and a modern/sleek decor on the inside. The crowd is a good looking one, probably 32 would the be average age of the clientele. . . Stayed in Vegas for a few nights, wanting to play some poker. I think this is one of the better poker rooms that I've visited (Fall 2014). There are 2 daily tournaments (1pm and 7pm) that are $125 per entry. The cash game are mostly 1-3 and 2-5 no limit holdem and maybe one or two pot limit omaha game. Real lively poker room, with good cocktail service. They give you bottles of Fiji just to give you an idea.
Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).. . Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.. . One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.. . The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.. . Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.. . Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.. . No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.. . Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. . . Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.. . Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.
I have to comment on the room.  The air filter in my room had not been cleaned ever.  The shower/bath combo... The wall grout was moldy.  The shower door leaked all over the slippery floor.  My boyfriend slipped and caught himself.  Figuring out all the buttons on the clock and around the room is annoying.  Also, $11 for gummy bears was insane.
Aria is an excellent argument for a 1/2 star system. They're not 4, they're not quite 5, they're right in the middle. . . Aria is definitely a modern take on Vegas and you can see their efforts in the rooms. From remote control curtains and touch screen remote control next to the bed, you definitely appreciate the modern touches. The view was also great with over-sized ceiling to floor windows overlooking part of The Strip. If you wanted to do Vegas and never leave your hotel, Aria has almost everything you need -- but then again so do most other Vegas hotels. The Spa was cool, if a bit overpriced. Same for the Brunch Buffet ($100+ for 2 people). The service was acceptable for Vegas, but definitely not the 5-star you would expect from a place charging premium prices. At times they were very accommodating - quick room service and surprisingly good food. But other times, I felt like I was in a Holiday Inn - they couldn't bring scissors up to my room to open a package I bought at their gift shop. The lady at the front desk was friendly and sent up a little "treat" when we mentioned that we were in town as part of our honeymoon.. . Overall I expected more for the price but you can't go wrong if you want a solid experience and are willing to pay a little more for it.
Wow. Are u kidding us?  I'm not sure if I'm at a dumpster with lounge chairs or if I'm at a pool in New Orleans the day after Fat Tuesday?!?!. The amount of trash all over the place is unbelievable??. Get your act together aria and clean this place up. What a disgrace!!. Are you on a hiring freeze?  We've been here for 3 hours and there is hardly any waitstaff?  We were lucky to get 2 drinks. I was going to bring clients here next month - no way would I do that now. When you lay at the pool bar - YOU WANT SERVICE!!!
We booked a three-night stay here.  We booked a non-smoking City-view King room, and warned them that we'd be checking in very late (our plane arrived at midnight).  After an exhausting trip, we got to the check in desk to find that we were the only one in line and the four agents were helping other customers.  But as soon as one customer finished up, the agent closed her station instead of helping us.  Not a good first impression.  That was when we were told that our room was a "smoking optional" room and that our "non-smoking" reservation was "just a request."  Well, that wasn't how it was presented to us when we booked.. . We got to the room, which we were assured would not smell, and it reeked.  My husband was up coughing all night.  I had problems of my own.  The beds at Aria are ridiculously soft.  You literally sink into the mattress and there is no support.  All night I tossed and turned between nightmares of being stuck on high-gravity planets, being swallowed by pit monsters, being paralyzed, and sinking into quicksand.  And the "blackout" curtains leak a lot of light from the top and bottom, so in the morning when the sun rose at 7AM, I had no choice but to wake up with it, in spite of having fallen asleep at 2:30.. . To be fair, the rooms themselves are gorgeous.  The decor is sumptuous but modern and tasteful and every room juts out a bit to give you a bit of a corner view.  The curtains and sheers open and close with the touch of a button and all the lights are on wall controls.  A single touch of a button by your bedside turns of all the lights and closes the curtains for you.. . The lobby and public spaces are really cool with an eclectic modern decor worthy of the newest cruise ships.  There's always some new detail to discover.  The buffet is extensive and we didn't have wait in lines, but the food wasn't any better than a buffet in, say, Reno.. . The second night they moved us to a larger room on a higher floor that was nonsmoking.  That was much better, but I still had a lot of trouble with the mattress.  I woke up at 3:30 AM with a horrible pain in my back (I do have some back issues, but I usually don't have trouble with hotel mattresses).  I finally put the two lounge chairs in the room together and slept on those, which was an improvement, but still not comfortable.  I don't know why Aria has chosen to go to such an extreme with their mattress selection.  It's like sleeping on a sack of peanut butter.  . . That morning, I told my husband that we had a choice: we could either risk moving to a new hotel and eat the third night we'd booked at the Aria or I was buying a ticket home for that afternoon.  We checked out and went to the Mandarin Oriental.. . I won't comment on the bars or casinos because I scarcely drink and we don't gamble.  We did have one drink at the Lobby Bar and, while it took a while for the waitress to take our order, the service after that was swift and polite.
Pretty disappointed. Didn't get the room that we booked (king size), instead we got a 2 queen that's a shared room since they have our room away! (a door in between). And the neighbors were loud! . . Not to mention that we're on our honeymoon for the weekend. . . Front desk is aware and comp us with $100 credit worth of anything in the hotel (buffet, etc) upon check in. They said if we booked with a diff company (Expedia) which is incorrect 3rd party btw; there is a guarantee in a spot but not the specific room. Wth?!. . Even with the comp credit - disappointed with the experience thus far. If it's any other day - fine. But it's our honeymoon.. . If anything upgrade us, not downgrade us. . Should have gone with other hotels.
I would actually give them 4.5 stars but Yelp won't let me do that.. . I actually had my stay at the Aria recently and am updating my review based on that.  . . With respect to the credit card issue, it took about 3 weeks after cancellation and a post on Yelp to get this rectified.  I still recommend watching your credit card statements because they were definitely a surprise.. . The hotel itself is pretty nice.  It's a newer hotel compared to the Bellagio and you can see that during the stay.  The bed is as comfortable as others have noticed and the rooms were clean.. . The food selection at the Aria is fantastic.  I am one of those folks who hates dressing up but still likes having nice dinners.  Most restaurants at the Aria allow casual dress but still have excellent quality.  . . Happy Hours are plenty.  A number of the restaurants on site have happy hours with discounted food and drink.. . Awesome spa.  I bought a pass to use the spa facilities (around $30-$35) I believe.  The spa facilities include use of a private pool, multiple Jacuzzi's (Cold, Warm, and Hot), sauna and eucalyptus steam room, salt room, and Japanese Stone beds.  All of them were awesome.  The amenities are also some of the best I have seen out there.. . There were some things that kept me from giving them the full 5 stars.  Most of the reasons are based on my past experiences at the Bellagio.  Both are MGM properties and both are AAA 5 diamond award winners.  Here are some things that the Aria does not do:. . 1. Turn down service is not done for standard rooms. 2. Location.  It is a little more of a challenge to get anywhere outside of City Center from the Aria.  Even with the train, it's still a pain to get anywhere. 3. Level of service was kind of dry.  Not sure what it was but I didn't feel as though the staff was willing to do what it takes to make a customer happy.. . I'm glad I had a chance to try the Aria out.  I will definitely be back for their awesome restaurant selection in the future and possibly stay there if the price is right.
Best place I have identified for a totally modern experience in Las Vegas. Extremely good values for room, amenities, restaurant choices, overall location on the strip, and of course entertainment. Shopping opportunities are excellent, as the location is close to Crystals, Shoppes at Mandalay Bay, and of course The Forum Shops. Big deal, so they don't have low quality coffee in the room....You can have all the coffee you desire at any one of 6 casual restaurants...I would return in a heartbeat...also a nice mix of guests...Bye the way, the pool and spa and fitness center are all first class...Stayed there for three days and did not have to leave the premises...
best bed ever!
Well lots of reasons to like and not like this place so I'll start with the likes.. The building is very cool state of the art and has one of the greenest ratings in all of Vegas. Its extremely modern so if you're looking for that chandler and mosaic tile feel you wont find it here.. The rooms were great very high tech with very comfortable beds and pillows.. . Two drinks at the pool bar $66 bucks yikes.. . 90 mins to check in! Crazy. . Great location . Great shopping, shows and restaurants-. I would have given 4 stars but it was just to modern for me.. I would recommend this place and if your looking for cutting edge modern feel this is the place to stay.
Yes it's expensive, and yes it can be noisy, large, and overwhelming really crowded, but over the service, and the sweeping views of the valley from a high floor rooms, and that enormous bathroom with the amazing amenities.  After having experienced a few disasters of neighboring properties, I will never leave the aria again. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, and beautifully maintained. As importantly, everyone from the front desk to housekeeping is outstanding and so well-trained. It is worth every penny.
We visited the Aria back in 2012 and wanted a re visit, we spend the first part of our stay in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan next door but due to the overwhelming amount of Hotels in Las Vegas we decided that we wanted to spend it in two hotels so the Aria was our second choice.. . We arrived around 6pm and there was no queue at the Reception so we was checked in right away, we had also received a complimentary upgrade to a Strip/City View, i had asked for a high floor and the highest they could put us was the 22nd, the hotel did not seem full so I'm not sure why they couldnt have put us on a higher floor but the 22nd was great!! . . We arrived into our room and the music on the TV came on automatically, and the blackout curtains begin to open to show you the view, a really cool idea! I also loved the remote controlled device where you could change the lighting,the TV,the automatic curtains and other parts of the room, the bed was also very comfortable, parts of the room was looking a bit dated from the bedside cabinets and wardrobes, but apart from that a really nice room with a great view of the Aria and parts of the Las Vegas Strip.. . What i love about this Hotel though is the chilled out vibe,everywhere seems really relaxed including all of the employees who work at the Aria.. . The pool area is also really nice and one of the main reasons why we came back, we love the pool areas alot and loved the chilled out music begging played from the speakers, all the pool attendants was really friendly and couldnt do enough to help, though drink prices are really expensive around the pool, we paid $17 for two beers which was a bit crazy but this can be expected from the Pool bars in Vegas.. . We had a superb stay in the Aria and we look forward to staying there again in the near future.
This was my third trip to Vegas and my experience at the Aria was top notch!   They live up to their five diamond designation and sophisticated design.   . . Our room was spectacular.   We did not have a strip view, but a gorgeous view of the mountains and the Monte Carlo.   The room was impeccably appointed with modern, luxurious decor.   The technology was really fun.   As others have noted, the curtains opened to greet us when we entered the room.   The control panel allowed us to control the electronics for the entire room without ever leaving our bed!. . We had 2 queen beds as requested, and they were very comfortable.   Each bed came with a practical tower of incredibly soft, comfortable pillows.   The bathroom was beautifully laid out in what appeared to be some kind of marble.   . . I cannot sing the praises enough of the Concierge desk.   All of our interactions with them were fun, helpful, and quickly responded to.   They always worked hard to help get our reservations, questions, or concerns addressed with a  smile.  We had great experiences in the casino, the lobby bar, Julian Serrano, Sage, and Cirque du Soleil as well.. . As others have noted, the Aria is pricey.  Cocktails at the pool will run you a minimum of $20 per mixed drink in general, but that's Vegas!   Vegas is not a budget vacation destination and the Aria lives into making it feel like a luxury experience.. . A couple of customer service notes:. . 1.  We checked in with a large group at the end of Columbus Day weekend.   We waited in line for check-in nearly 30 minutes and they seemed a little bit unprepared for the rush.   A group check-in desk for large parties would be REALLY helpful.. . 2.  When we arrived, a room was not ready for us until after 4 PM Vegas time despite the fact check-in is 3 PM.   It took two visits and a $10 tip for the concierge to get us into a room.   We had left the East Coast at 5 AM that morning and were utterly exhausted.  . . 3.  The toilet in our room didn't work upon our arrival and it took about 24 hours to get it repaired.   That's a pretty basic, essential part of my expectation of a hotel, and I would have liked to have seen a more urgent, timely response.  . . Otherwise, a wonderful visit!!
Aira is amazing. Such a complete, wonderful experience. They have thought of everything, and you will be totally comfortable. There is endless fun things to do, and an amazing social atmosphere across all of the gaming and dining options. You must at least visit Aria while you're in Vegas, it's stunning.
Came here to see the new Circus Ole show and dinner.  The hotel and casino are one of the most modern on the strip and the ambiance is quite striking.   And all this at a price of course !!!  Very nice to stop in at but perhaps to spend any significant time you might consider it a place for special occasions !!!
Aria was absolutely amazing. I loved every minute of my stay. If you are looking for comfort, class and relaxation between all of the crazy vegas partying this is the place for you. From the complimentary robes, to the bath tub, to one touch button that shuts the curtains and the lights, these little comforts go a long way. There is also a large variety of delicious restaurants. We ate at Sage and it was a great experience. I will stay at Aria every time I visit Vegas, no hesitation. This is really how I feel.
Michelle @ Aria Reservations is the best - and their phone reservation system is a delightful, no-wait surprise direct to her (or others') help!  . . I've visited Aria via a friend's reservation in the past, and have had nothing but a perfect experience there at one of Vegas's newest hotels.  . . In this case, I had discounted rates for a conference, I didn't get any confirmation emails (Aria's email notifications may not all be going thru), so I called up Michelle.  She went above-and-beyond to remind me of a past reservation I earlier made there at half the price (I did have a later calendar invite to cancel it!), and switched me over hassle-free.  . . I was just impressed by the amount of care she took into making my reservation perfect (early checkin, late checkout).  And to find that she's been working there for many years as the one & only Michelle - such people are gems to encounter.  Hope she gets the recognition she deserves!
well the service at the check in was great however when I booked i thought that i only owed 1/2 come to find out i had to pay 1/2 plus the resort fee, plus tax , plus a 250 Deposit  that would be returned to my account in 10 to 12 business days? So that peeved me a bit, rooms were clean nice view but the beds were terrible! I litterly sank into the pit of doom in the middle of the bed.....the beds were terrible waaaaayyyy to soft.....two drinks at the lift bar were pricy too 40 bucks for two drinks....whewww....the Aira is nice but i have have stayed at better places......i think it was too much money for what it was next time I will stay at the Cromwell worth the money for sure! And the Haze Nightclub total joke, rude $$$$$ and all MEN! Slimy ones at that.....
This review is just for the casino floor as I have yet to stay at Aria but friends of mine have. Aria looks breathtaking structurally from the outside as you drive in from the strip and into the City Center. The little fountains of dancing water and the lights showcasing them, as well as the buildings of the resort also. Very modern and right in line with all the new hotels in Vegas.. . But the one thing I noticed when I first walked in here the first few months they were open and on recent trips since is that it's dark in this hotel. I mean, I felt like my eyes were deceiving me but the dim lighting on the casino floor and surrounding areas did not leave a good impression on me. I'll never forget it cause I was thinking that and remarked to my friends in amazement how a brand new (at the time) hotel & casino that was the epicenter of the City Center (also brand new at the time) could be so poorly lit?!? Not good... And also there are a lot of "dead" zones and corners that are just wasted space within the casino floor and the 24 hour restaurant/cafe towards the back of the property. . . And I cant go without reviewing the valet. Valet lane is a bit confusing and hard to spot at first with their signs being so small. By the time you realize you've mistakenly taken the thru-traffic or taxi lane, it's too late and you gotta go all the way around to finally valet your car. Valet pickup is a decent setup with a nice air-conditioned room for you to wait in with magazines & vending machines. Not sure how long they expect you to wait for your car but that was an interesting touch. I thought the placement of the valet being all the way towards the front end of the Aria property was too long of a walk. You actually leave the casino through 2 sets of double doors before you reach the valet station to drop off your ticket. I might be hypercritical but ease & convenience of valet dictates where I like to stay in Vegas sometimes... That and a well-lit casino & resort.
We just got back from LV and except for my losing ways, had a great vacation.  A large part of our overall satisfaction was because of our stay at the Aria.  It is a beautiful hotel (although a little dark if you ask my wife) on the strip, within proximity of many options for dining and shopping.  Many people don't seem to understand that staying on the strip is expensive so you gotta take what you can get.  The Miracle Mile is just across the street for shopping and some cheap eats.  We also walked leisurely to the Cosmopolitan, Monte Carlo, and New York. New York during our stay.  The MGM and Paris were options we weren't able to get to, but are also within walking distance.. . The Aria's modern decor made it feel fresh and open. Some of the more ornately styled hotels feel stuffy to me.......maybe it's all in my head, but the high ceilings in the casino  definitely made things less smokey.. . Lots of buttons in the room.  Controls for lights and drapes were so convenient-I really miss them.  The alarm clock has a big well-lit face.  Beside being easy to read, it provided just enough light to get me to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  We did have a small problem connecting to the hotel's Wi-Fi, but a call to the concierge got us connected to their tech support and we were soon in.. . The room was clean and spacious.  It was thoughtfully and tastefully furnished.  the bed was soft-the wife loved it, but I like my bed a little more firm.  We both liked having the commode separated from the rest of the bathroom, but there wasn't a place to put my reading material (did I just complain about that?).  Two sinks was very nice as was having his and her closets.  A curious thing was having the shower in the same cubicle as the soaking tub.  I guess you shower and then jump in the tub, but I decided to wait while the wife soaked so as not to splash her.....chivalry is not dead!. . Everybody has bad days. and some people do not belong in service industries, but I think if you are nice to people-they ought to be nice back.  I had no problems at the Aria......I wish I could say I'm lucky, but my skinny wallet says different..........
Simple and to the point . 1. No in room coffee maker.  You must hi downstairs to Starbucks or another lower level French coffee shop.  Hearing to expect long lines.... We'll see.. 2. Super dark casino area...making for a somewhat dark entire first level.. 3. -2- service calls for assistance with the tv. This in just the first morning after our 3pm check in. . 4. Unless you want to spend 30 minutes upon check in reading about how to operate your room...book elsewhere.  Just too high tech for the average traveler.   Unless you're under 25.. 5.  Lighting in the rooms is "low".  While I applaud them for their LEED certification, additional lighting options would be nice.  . 6. No automatic doors when arriving with your luggage... And no one to assist except for your friendly fellow check in client ( if your lucky). . Final thought: my husband and I won't be staying here again.
Completely unacceptable experience!  Booked a corner suite at this establishment for a long weekend in addition to booking 3k in entertainment and restaurant reservations.  Stood at the reception desk for over an hour with no explanation from Management as to why our room was not ready.  Then when we were finally given our room nothing worked.  TV Phone nothing including Aria's signature control 4 technology.  We could not even turn on the tv to watch college football or call down for room service.  This problem persisted for the entire visit with no explanation from management with the only solution being the offer of a $350 food and beverage credit to compensate for a $1500 dollar hotel room that was far below standard for a holiday Inn let alone a resort of this supposed quality.  The service was horrible and hotel management obviously had no interest in making thing right from a compensatory standpoint.  It was obvious to me that they are accustomed to disappointing their guests.  Last time I will ever stay at this hotel or any other in it's management group we will be going back to the Wynn!
I really like this hotel- as a Marriott affiliate, they take good care of you if you have status. Got a wonderfully large room with a huge balcony overlooking the strip. Check-in was fast, and the location is decent in the middle of the strip. Casino and restaurants are just so-so though, would gamble elsewhere.
re:  Zarkana. . Stayed off the strip, because not too many hotels allow pets!  Saw Zarkana here which had it's good and bad, but overall it was enjoyable as most Cirque shows are.  We arrived early to walk around the casino, and the casino is by far extremely nice.  Everything is high quality and state of the art.  Will this casino be in favor 10+ years from now?  Whoknows what peoples taste are and unfortunately, unless one can make a classic design like the Bellagio, few hotels will be that successful.  . . The theatre for Zarkana is very nice.  Definitely hope to visit this venue again.  This resort is definitely worth walking through.
This review is mainly based on Zarkana. . . It was my birthday present to see Zarkana with my boyfriend thanks to MyVegas. First, MyVegas booked the wrong time for both of our tickets, but Jose at the box office was awesome. He just ran his fingers on the keyboard to fix everything and did. We ended up getting center seats! They were more in the back, but still decent seats. Well, we wound up getting lost and missed half the show. I was so upset, but Angel, an usher, talked to JJ , the manager, for us and got us tickets for the same seats and same time for the next day! That was so amazing of her to do that. . . Come the next day, we meet with Devin at the box office and he is a super nice guy! He asked us about our plans and why we were out there. We mentioned my birthday and he gave us some great recommendations for food and such. When he printed out our tickets, Devin gave us an awesome surprise...7th row seats! They were amazing! It was so cool being that close! Aria's staff at the Zarkana box office really made our weekend. Thanks! :)
Aria has a pretty good buffet for $50. The shopping mall is one of the most impressive in all of vegas. I believe Aria is very selective in who they let rent inside. Just by the looks of it you can tell they hired some of the world best architectural designer. You will find nothing but high end boutique stores. Rent for a fact is outrageous. I heard that Louis Vuitton pays $100,000 for their 2 story store.
I can't believe this place doesn't have a higher score, it must be from bitter losers. This casino is awesome, and the restaurants are amazing. The rooms are super classy too! For example, we walked into our suite and the curtains opened up automatically! The whole place is modern & trendy, which we love. The dealers at the tables also had great personalities, especially Larry at roulette last night. Such a cool guy! . Located next to everywhere you want to be on the strip. I'm also not the only one who seems to have better luck at this casino, I've heard this from other people as well. Ultimate Texas Holdem the table game is even hand dealt! Please don't change this! Nowhere else seems to do that, which is why we always choose to gamble here. "Encore!" Wait, I mean "go Aria"! ;)
