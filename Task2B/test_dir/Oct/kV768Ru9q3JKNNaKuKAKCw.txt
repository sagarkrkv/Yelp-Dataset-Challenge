This show was Amazing so amazing. I plan on seeing it again. I understand now why the ticket prices are on the steep side. Worth it.
I liked this show very much.  I don't think it's as good as Le Reve at the Wynn, but it is still outstanding.  I especially love the use of water for this show.  The stunts are spectacular.  The price point is kind of high, but it is worth it.  The story was easy to follow.  I would see this again.
Everyone says this is the show to go to. I went to it for my first experience of Cirque du Soleil and was so bored. You watch people dive into water for an hour and a half, not really something that could hold my attention.
Never....in my life....have I experienced such a breathtaking show.  It is beyond amazing.....honestly...you cannot skip this show if you go to Vegas.  I've been to Vegas 2-3 times a year for the last 8 years or so and have never been.  I think due to the $180 price tag attached.  I finally said screw it and decided to pay the money....and I kick myself for not paying sooner.  Simply.....amazing.  Nuff said.
It's a beautiful show but not entirely worth the $185 I paid to sit in one of the first rows. It is impressive but at about half the price, Mystere is a more focused, immersive experience with more awe-inducing acrobatics. At times I felt there was too much going on and lost focus and it made me somewhat check out of the show, whereas Mystere really locks you in and keeps the viewer engaged.
It"s  amazing show,you cannot skip this show if you go to Vegas.Performers did great .The show has humor,romance and acrobatics,really cool.Worth every penny!
Still in awe! Las Vegas, more than anything to me, means theater, and this performance was the very best of the best. The talent, creativity, choreography, staging, music, costumes - everything was outstanding! Save what money you had planned to spend in the casino (or just spend your winnings, you lucky duck) and buy a ticket!
very impressed! mesmerizing show that is very different from the other cirque du soleil shows. I loved the water part & especially the fire eater guy. well worth the price! I would see this one again.
Absolutely amazing. The tickets are expensive but worth it. It's definitely worth paying a little more for the lower sections, but being super close isn't really necessary. There is so much going on to see you'll be entertained from almost any view.
Amazing!! Was 4 rows back right in the middle and was better than any other seat. If you want to get a few sprinkles go on the first 2 rows;). Loved everything a wonderful mix of comedy and the wonderful acrobatics !! A must see!!
Absolutely amazing!! Very unique and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I don't know how many times I said, "Wow!" We were on the 2nd row - the supposed splash zone, but we didn't get wet at all. So glad we were up close and personal! I loved the clowns, too. I got to play with them in the spotlight and take home their inner tube!
I saw Cirque du Soleil's "O" tonight.. . The theatre is beautiful!. . I had seen "Kurios" a couple weeks ago in Toronto and was looking forward to seeing this one ... and I wasn't disappointed.  It is similar with lots of acrobatics, balancing, singing, clapping, laughs and more ... but on and in water!  It was amazing how they made the water appear (becoming a deep pool) and then disappear (becoming a stage).  And it was fun the way swimmers would suddenly appear in the water and then disappear again (without climbing out of the pool).
I'm not a huge fan of Cirque shows, but "O" was impressive. When I'm sitting there in awe, wondering how the hell they're doing all this stuff, they deserve no less than 5 stars. I couldn't believe the amount of physical strength and discipline that goes into a show like this. There's no storyline, but it actually didn't bother me. The acrobatic feats and dives were amazing enough to keep me interested. The clowns were also not that annoying either. What I appreciate most about Cirque shows is the ability to convey a message without using words, so everyone can understand- and the clowns do that well.. . Like other Cirque shows, there's usually a lot going on at one time, so you have to pay attention! I nearly missed one of the acrobats balancing on her head on a trapeze bar in mid-air because I was so focused on what was happening on the stage below. Besides water, they also use fire in several of their acts. I loved how they pulled people from the audience just like "The Simpsons" parody of Cirque- made me laugh!. . I would recommend a seat in the lower orchestra area. There was maybe a $25 price difference between upper and lower, and it was worth it. Check prices directly from the Bellagio website and look for the tickets offered at a 15% discount for certain showtimes.
