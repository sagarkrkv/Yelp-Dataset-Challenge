Yawwwwwwn. Another boring corporate Vegas hotel with a ridiculous casino. Table games are all jacked up carnival games with horrible odds. This place will make you miss the Vegas of old pretty quickly. Rooms are nice but so what.
This review is from the perspective of a visitor, who did not stay at this hotel, but from a wide-eyed walk-in guy in for a look.. . This hotel was thriving, busy, interesting. The staff was motivated and made me feel comfortable and welcome. The hotel canal spaces are strikingly beautiful. The lighting mesmerizing after coming in from the hot Vegas sun.. . Drop by as I did, enjoy a salad and wine at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria, where they treated me like a valued customer. I recommend that you sit at the bar and watch the food prep that goes on there.. . Enjoy! .
I put $5 into one of their vending machines.  It jammed and didn't dispense my drink nor gave me my change.  Understandable, things happen.  However, I'm very disappointed with customer service.  I called in and was told to wait there and they would send someone over to take care of it.  I waited for over half an hour, a staff member came and all they did was put an "out of order" note on it.  They said they could not refund me my money.  I called a couple more times with no results and the run around.  Eventually they transferred me to the lost and found department.  They seemed as clueless as me as to why I was transferred to them.  Really Venetian?  Very disappointed.
I have been playing dollar slots for over one hour and have not been offered one single drink. This in my opinion qualifies as bad customer service. In fact I haven't seen one person walk around with a drink tray inquiring if anyone wants a drink.
Love, love, love this hotel!!!  I have stayed here at least 20 times and each time have had a great experience!  The staff is awesome from front desk to valet.  The rooms are all suites and make you feel so pampered.  i have never had a problem with any room at this hotel. Free Wifi!
I like the Venetian hotel in Macau more. Though they are patterned to each other. I like that it is very accessible, so many ways to get in and out of the hotel. Just wanna share other hotels that caught my attention..Best way to go in Vegas is in group.
I went out of my normal routine this time around in Vegas and really paid the price! Everything was a bust. It got to the point I just wanted to fly home ASAP (and it was only a 50 hour trip).. . I assumed I would love the Venetian. I had always enjoyed walking through it. I heard great things about the pool. I figured I couldn't go wrong here. Next time I will stick with hotels I know are my style! . . The rooms are beautiful here! The room I stayed in was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever slept in. That just didn't make up for what is lacked in other areas to me. I would actually suggest this hotel for a couple looking for some romantic time. I was with friends and just couldn't enjoy all of the amenities the room had to offer. Again, not their fault, but you should know if you are looking for a wild girls weekend. . . Check in and out was fast. The line for cabs was always moving steady and well organized. I ordered room service once and they were fast and VERY friendly. All of the employees were friendly (except casino). I'll get to that.. . You could get lost for days in here. Most staff can help you but I ran across a few that were just as confused as I was. I would recommend spending a day just exploring the different areas within the hotel (if you have time to kill).. . The pool was nice. I liked the scene. No real @%#h0l&es hanging out here. Drinks are crazy expensive (but average for Vegas prices). The server we had was excellent! She took great care of us and kept the glasses of ice coming. I wish I could remember her name. She was adorable! . . I also appreciate that the staff immediately moves belongings from unattended chairs. Don't attempt to save a chair at this place while you sleep upstairs. I went down about 10am and had no trouble getting a good spot. . . Only half the pool is actually in the sun. It's the more crowded half. I was over heated after 20 minutes so I guess that can be a good thing. . . The casino is where they lose me! Minimums on tables are pretty average. I was annoyed when I went down to play Pai Gow Poker one morning and I was the only person playing (8am) in an almost empty casino and the minimum was $25. Whatever. . . The real kicker is drinks! I gambled for 4 straight hours before I ever saw a cocktail waitress at one point. The other wait times averaged anywhere from 10 minutes-2 hours. I would say average was an hour wait for a drink. Totally unacceptable. I was never offered water, etc. . . The girls were sweet when they came by, but finding them was beyond ridiculous! Good luck purchasing a drink there too. Sky high prices which put me over the edge as I was dropping huge cash in casino and couldn't get a damn Pepsi! . . Basically, only go here if you are looking for a beautiful room and spending some real time in it. When it's time to gamble HEAD ELSEWHERE!
Such a beautiful hotel! The rooms were HUGE- nice big beds and a big living room area. The staff was very attentive and quick to respond to all our room service/requests despite how many people were staying at the hotel.. The restaurant area was awesome, a river running through with gondolas and the ceiling was painted to look like the sky! A very unique ambiance. . I only ate at one restaurant in the hotel (it was decent) and didn't gamble at that hotel so I can't attest to that- but as far as the accommodations go, it was great! . I would definitely recommend for someone looking for a great place to stay on the strip!
Well,. my boyfriend proposed to me on the gondola ride so I guess I have to give it 5 stars now!. . Beautiful hotel. I have been here many times but had only been on the gondola the last time.. . My fiance got us a private gondola and we enjoyed the 14 minute ride. the girl who was our gondolier sang beautifully! . . Overall, a bit pricey, but definitely worth it :)
Nice clean casino and shops area with great ambiance of Italy !!!  The rooms are elegant and the service upscale at a bit of a price - but so is gambling anywhere, so enjoy it. The open sky look and ambiance of the Shops area and Gondola rides are right out of Disney Pirates ride. Very much has lasting magic !!!
A lot of great things about this place but they lowered the black jack payout to 6 - 5.  If you play bj don't stay here, the house more than doubled their take.
Beautiful place to stay, clean and well decorated. Friendly staff all over the resort. . But I'm taking a star away because we spent an entireday constantly trying to navigate our way thru the resort and its confusing attachment The Palazzio. . I partially grew up in Vegas and I haven't been back for ten years. Let's just say that City Center has caused The Strip to lose its old Vegas charm.
For the most part I enjoy staying at the Venetian in Vegas more than its counterpart in Macau.. . The rooms there are very similar to what you find in Vegas.  Ours was roomy and the two beds never felt crowded.  The little railing separating the beds from the living area was a nice touch (and again, you get the same deal if you stay in the Macau version).  I slept relatively well here and would consider staying here again for the room.. . I'm not that big a fan of gambling here as with other higher-end Vegas casinos it can get costly to play with the higher table stakes.  The gambling atmosphere is fine though honestly I wasn't too thrilled with the dining options here.  I ended up grabbing a drink at Buddy's where the atmosphere was nice and the bartender was pretty cool.  . . In terms of location this place is decent - it's not too far of a walk from Caesars, Bellagio and the other big time casinos.  The Grand Canal Shoppes are fine though personally I a fan of the Macau version more because it's simply much larger and has a better variety of shops and restaurants.. . Nonetheless - from a comfort standpoint the rooms and amenities here are good and you can't go wrong if you're looking to stay here for a Vegas visit.
Nice place but they are cutting back in a lot of ways,  for instance blackjack only  pays 6to5 instead of 3 to 2 like every other casino... Takes a lot of fun out of it. Cocktail service at the tables was also the slowest I saw between The cosmopolitan and Mirage on this visit!
The rooms are large with a separate sunken living room area, at least two flat screen tv's, large bathroom with his and hers sinks and separated toilet, beds are very comfortable, room is beautifully decorated and very clean.
Beautiful hotel! Our room was very clean, and perfect size for my Husband and I in one king bed. The bed however was very uncomfortable. We found the couch easier to sleep on. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The one major complaint is the 20th floor hallway smelled like sewage! We'd have to hurry to the elevator or our room so we didn't have to smell it. (At least it wasn't in the room). We were very close to the Mirage and could hear the Volcano erupt every 30mins from our room. We aren't much for gambling, so didn't spend too much time in the Casino. The decor through the Shops was beautiful, but confusing. Hard to find your way around. . This was our first time to Vegas, we would probably stay here again if we ever came back.
Amazing hotel, great staff, service, restaurants, everyone is polite AND PROFESSIONAL including security and floor managers/pit bosses. Vibrant nightlife and the rooms are very spacious and well decorated. Pool areais top 3-4 in Vegas. Also amazing music always playing throughout the hotel and Palazzo
The Venetian is one of my favorite hotels on the strip! The hotel itself is beautiful. There's something about it that is so gorgeous. The rooms are big because they are all suites. So even their standard rooms has a ton of space and its very beautifully decorated. I love gambling here. . . Their pool is GORGEOUS! I love the view from the pool and the loungers are very comfortable.. . I would absolutely recommend staying here.
I have stayed here several times and it is getting run down fast. Filthy rooms, poor service, etc. Reserved a king, got a double, paid full price and rooms went on sale for half of the next day. . . Do yourself a favor and stay at the Bellagio.
The Venetian is a great hotel to stay at! The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are very spacious and beautifully decorated. . . Would definitely recommend staying here!
