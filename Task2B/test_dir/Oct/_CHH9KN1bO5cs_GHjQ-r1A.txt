A cute restaurant for date night! Happy hour deals are great, but only applicable at the bar. If you're trying to get drunk, these drinks are not for you. The chocolate content is significantly higher than the alcohol in them. The burger with waffle fries are my favorite! . . So sad to see they closed!
So disappointed to see that max brenner closed.  I am glad I got to try it before it closed, the chocolate fondu was so good, just didn't have enough chocolate to dip everything in :(
