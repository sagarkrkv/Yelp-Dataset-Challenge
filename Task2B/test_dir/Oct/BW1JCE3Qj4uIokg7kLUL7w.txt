4 stars because I think the price was a bit high. . . We went for lunch on a Sunday. I think we ordered off of the lunch menu. Or maybe they have one menu. Either way. . I got the grilled burger with onion marmalade and Vermont cheese. Huge burger, great sauce, cooked to perfection. . The burger came with a mountain of fries, I mean a mountain. Fries were just regular skinny cut fries. Nothing special. I finished my burger because it was so good. . . My girlfriend got the linguini with garlic sauce, pancetta, and steamed clams. She said the sauce was pretty flavorless but still enjoyed it. Would probably not order it again. . We sat at the bar and the waitress was really nice. Gave us recommendations on food and was able to keep up some small talk. . . We paid $65 for two meals and a tiny sangria. I know we went to a more upscale restaurant but this was lunch. We paid less for DINNER at burgr. I would come back for dinner.
Went to Wolfgang Puck's on a Tuesday evening with my mom. We were greeted by friendly staff and immediately seated. The servers and bussers were very attentive and kind. We ordered the baby iceberg lettuce salad, which we were offered to split. This was the perfect size for us. The salad was fresh, yummy and had loads of cheese. We also split a Margherita pizza. The crust was light and crispy. The sauce had a really nice taste. We really enjoyed eating here and would definitely recommend it!
3.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the service.. . Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is located inside MGM Grand. The food was pretty good (not great), but service was awesome. All the servers were very attentive and friendly.. . We ordered:. . Mixed Green Salad - A basic salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette. . White Pizza - Pizza with roasted chicken, spinach, garlic, red onions, and feta cheese. This pizza was good but very creamy and heavy.. . Italian Sausage Pizza - Pizza with Italian sausage, roasted peppers, mushrooms, smoked ricotta, onions, and parsley. I enjoyed this pizza more than the White Pizza  because I prefer red sauce over white sauce.. . Hand Cut Fettuccini - Fettuccini with mushrooms, parmesan reggiano, and parsley. The pasta noodles were good.. . . Overall, I enjoyed all the dishes. Although nothing was amazing, everything was good and decently priced for a Vegas restaurant.
The service was great. It was nice to ask the waiter about the food and for him to answer with great detail. My husband and I ordered the salmon and organic chicken both dishes were good and light.
Fantastic restaurant...one of the best meals I've had. We went before catching the 9:30 Ka show. Great service, friendly waitstaff, quick, simple but elegant atmosphere, and good food. The cheddar bread is delicious. I ordered the mussels, which was a heaping (at least 1.5 lbs) in a creamy, spicy red broth, with bread and homecut French fries...perfectly crisped. Everything tasted so fresh. My sister got goat cheese and spring pea manicotti. Waitstaff was very attentive, bringing heated washclothes at the end of the meal. Highly recommended.
My friends and I came here our first night in Vegas and had a nice dinner as a group. The service was excellent and the food was great. I got the chicken and roasted vegetables and the chicken was cooked perfectly. My husband got the flat bread and he thought it was tasty. Our friends got various dishes and they were pleased. I would definitely go back.
Outstanding. Food was great and the service was outstanding too. I had chicken and my wife the spaghetti and meatballs. Both meals were outstanding. Would for sure eat here again. Little pricey but worth it.
This place is open very late night. Great for late arrivals and you don't feel like eating fast food. Food is pretty good. Price is average for the strip. Expect to pay about 15-25 for you food.
To reduce the price of dinner we decided to eat at Wolfgang Puck. . We ordered a pineapple mojito (12 dollar), a hurricane (16 dollar) and a coke (4,50 dollar). . We shared the starter (tuna tartare 21 dollar) which was very good. Our son wanted a lasagne (21 dollar). Remark : very strange taste. The shrimp pasta (26 dollar) was too expensive. The fish of the day was very casual (33 euro) so also too expensive.. We ended with a pear cheesecake (12 dollar) which was better the day before somewhere else.... The cafe latte was ok (4,50 dollar).. The waiter was too pushy for his tip, in spite of a bill from 162,42 dollar...... The prices are raised and we don't see a reason why... no extra service or something special to order.. For being 'a brasserie' it's not worth at all.. We will not return, because for this price, we can eat better somewhere else.
