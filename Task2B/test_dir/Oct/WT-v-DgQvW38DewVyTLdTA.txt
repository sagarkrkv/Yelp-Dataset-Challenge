I love this hotel....  Rooms are big and clean, friendly staff , and a very affordable prices ... The neighborhood not so good but o well, public transportation outside of the casino. Overall a nice place to stay while u in vegas.
Where should i start, um, lets talk the good, very affordable rooms, a lot of foot traffic for shops and adventure dome... now the bad, shower has leaky faucet, um hello Califonia is in a drought and this breaks my heart. The ugly, $ 18+for a mediocre buffet MEDIOCRE! !!! While we were eating our delicious yet very expensive pizza at the desk i decided to look at the inside the desk drawer and at first noticed some receipts, well i grabbed those and they were from 9/11/14. Great if only we could turn back time. We got here on 9/20, thats not the scary part. I found a bundle of used toilet paper that left me grossed out thinking about ebola the rest of the night. But what in the world! They need to pay more or something because obviously their housekeepers arnt giving a crap if the rooms are throughly cleaned. Later went to find a pair of old stinky flats that was pretty funny. Well to cut this short, not impressed, food over priced like every where else onthe strip, out of two rooms we had one room was spotless upon arrival the other just looked the part. Try a little harder circus circus. Give your employees a little more $ so they can look happy doing their job and maybe theyll actually do what theyre suppose to. Please.
The buffet food tastes like cardboard. Our server and the fresh pasta chef were very nice. Vince Neil bar service is slow and the bartender forgot to bring us our drinks. Not worth it.
Enjoyed our stay. Average hotel and had overall good experience. Took entire family and kids had a great time for their first time in Vegas.
room clean, not fancy. temp tricky.  Deli - don't even think about it, we sent our food back.  Blue Iguana we loved.  Customer drop off/check inconvenient - front is for taxi/bus/limo only - rest have to park (a distance) and walk luggage in and out.
I did not stay, just visited and played blackjack.  I was expecting a circus, but there was none. Lots of midway games for the kids and some tiny free acts to watch.  No circus :(. Found a $3 blackjack table and enjoyed ourselves for a long time.  Nice dealers and atmosphere.
I just got back from staying here over the weekend & I have to admit I'm very pleased with the remodeling done here compared to before how the rooms looked. I stayed in the casino tower we had 2 rooms one with a king bed & the other with 2 queens. Both the rooms were amazing the beds are so comfortable I felt like I was sleeping on a big soft pillow! I slept like a baby! The mattresses are of pillow top! The room was big & comes with a personal safe for free! And the free kering coffee is wonderful also!. I would really recommend this hotel & I won't be ashamed to do it now! High five Circus Circus for making this hotel more nicer looking & welcoming!
Tower rooms were decent much to my surprise. Great for a place to rest your sleepy head however the casino is run down and kinda yuck. So in summary... if youre looking for a cheap place to stay for a night because youre in town for a event or something it's a perfect location! However... if youre looking to enjoy the night life or at least have some decent people watching opportunities... go somewhere else.
Circus circus was the most dismal attempt of a hotel I highly suggest you stay as far away from that smokey dump. The staff are as rude as they come and don't get me started on Nora she is the slowest blackjack dealer in the world but not as slow as the waitresses that take 3 hours to get you a drink. The wifi is only on selected levels and that's just as slow Nora. It's so far away from anything good you may as well spend the extra few bucks on a better hotel. Overall this place is hell and you should never pop Molly's  here because those demons will get ya!!
This hotel made my experience in Vegas terrible! A salesperson named HEIDI cancelled my reservation without telling my party and I. The worst part is that after a 6 hour flight we couldn't check in until 4 hours later. The worst customer service ever! Management is rude and tried to say someone named Heidi didn't exist yet Jet Blue was on the phone with her. ALSO, after the 4 hour wait the manager gave us a complimentary dinner but when we went to order we were informed that the manager had no MONEY on her account.. . Overall, you get for what you pay for here. Cheap rooms for cheap service. Pay an extra 20 bucks for a better hotel.
Excellent service for s reasonable price.  Has all the new slot machines and awesome stores inside the casino.  West tower room is nice and clean.  They have subway and McDonald's across the street that is open 24hrs.
For those looking to stay on the Las Vegas Strip for the low, this is the place to go.  This is so far the ONLY hotel on the strip that caters to families.  Circus Circus is also the few remaining hotels from the 1969 era still operating today.  This hotel has many rooms scattered around in different buildings.  Getting around can be quite confusing but should be ok once you get used to it.  Check-In lines are extremely long.  Most of the shops here are low-end.  There are shops here with Asian vendors.  Except for Krispy Kreme the eateries here are low-end as well.  If these aren't for you, there are other hotels with better food ad better stores.  There is always a Subway and a McDonald's nearby that are open 24 hours to cure your hunger blues.  The Adventuredome indoor amusement park sets this hotel apart from the others.  Keep in mind that New York New York has a roller coaster and The Linq is a ferris wheel that gives you breathtaking views of the Strip.  Circus Circus also has an old school photo shop where you can dress up and take personal photos.  The best thing about this hotel is the free Wi-Fi for those staying here as well as free access to fitness rooms and discounts on certain items (the resort fee covers all that).  Selection of TV channels are subpar and need immediate improvement.  As for my stay here it was decent.  It can be a bit loud in the lobby at times.  After all, you're on the Strip.  If you are looking for something good to eat I would eat somewhere else.  The food quality is extremely low budget and not worth the time.  There are other hotels (Downtown or Off Strip) that offer a better experience.  However if you are looking to save some money this is the place for you.
So there are a million hotels in Vegas obviously, but this one is what we chose. We made reservations in the west tower for a king bed. Well when we arrived, all king bed rooms were taken. So instead of giving us some BS, dude instantly suggested he would upgrade us to a deluxe room for free... Uhhhj, YEA! . We had a lot of luggage so we used bell service. Dude made small talk with us, and asked where we are from. We said Okinawa. He goes oh cool, I was stationed at Camp Schwab (a tiny marine base that you'd only know if you'd actually been there so he wasn't lying). I was like wow no way what a small world. . It's only the first night but so far everything is working out great! Dude being at Schwab, free room upgrade, decent restaurant etc... Worth a 4 star... For us anyways. Of course if you're willing to $$$$$, vegas has better places but call it luck, we are getting great service and a great deal! Dude even thanked me for my service. And after hitting my 15th year in the army this year, I gotta say I never get tired of genuine Americans genuinely thanking me. Means a lot. Circus circus will definitely get my business again.
My sister and I came here looking to see the casino of our childhood. Remember watching the Circus Circus commercials on TV? Your parents gamble and you play in the most EPIC indoor midway.There are circus performers everywhere in beautiful sparkling costumes. The smell of popcorn and cotton candy fills the air... Well, maybe it was all-that back then, but let me tell ya, this place is definitely past its prime. . . The casinos are dark and dingy. The arcades are just as sad as your local carnival. The midway rides are limited, expensive, and disappointing. You leave and notice you spent a whole bottle of hand sanitizer in a few hours. Not to mention, I'd be afraid to walk anywhere from this hotel. . . Don't waste your time. There are WAY better hotels available, even if you're watching your wallet.
Total crap shoot. Room reservation receptionist rude and unprofessional.  You get what you pay for.
got free room here from playing on myvegas.com .. the room was nice . there are  lots of kids in this hotel . the only negative is , that they charge you a 14.50 $ per day resort fee , even though you got the rooms for free.
What a shitty experience. If you are decent person and want to be treated OK not even get close to this place. Asian guy at the check in was vey rude. Don't go
Not my favorite hotel on the strip, but inexpensive. Housekeeping is lacking. We had towel service the first  day.. no bed made. (Not saying I want new sheets but at least throw it together). The next day we didn't get serviced at all. Then at 845am on checkout day (not till 11am btw) the cleaning lady just walks into the room. Whaaaaaaat? The place has a funny smell.. lol. We started calling it "home" everytime we would come back from other hotels... based on that smell alone. The Internet sucks here. But the gambling is okay :) players club gives you a free 5$ play... and you collect points and money as you play. Just don't forget to collect those comp  $s  efore you leave.
Oh, Circus Circus. When I told my dad we were staying here, he said that it was the cheapest place on the strip when he used to visit back in the 70s. Looks like it's still the cheapest and the carpet is definitely still the same! . . Given, the reviews, I was fully expecting this place to be gross. Lucky for us, it was not. Our room was clean if not updated. . . If you're looking for a place just to sleep (or not sleep) during your stay in Vegas and don't want to spend a lot. Circus Circus is still a viable option. . . Pool is pretty meh. Food is gross. Casino has seen better days. It's dark and has the signature stale cigarette smell (come on NV it's time to ban indoor smoking).. . My only run in with the staff was with an overly aggressive bellman who got in my personal space while I was looking for my check ticket. Seriously, dude. There is no one behind me in line, lay off! He then proceeded to take over ten minutes to find my bag and wouldn't take no as an answer when I said I didn't need help to the room. I get that you work for tips, but the fastest way to lose your tip is telling a female customer that she's not strong enough to lift her own luggage. I overheard another bell demanding a tip from a foreign tourist (who had no idea about tipping). Guess I shouldn't expect the staff at a tacky hotel to have any tact. . . PS: They are also extremely pushy about check out. Check out is earlier than most hotels and the maids are waiting at your door well BEFORE check out. Be prepared to leave in a hurry otherwise you will be charged.
I didn't expect a 5 star hotel at all for the price but the dirt...in the room and the hall way ...the noise... I can not stand!!!The view in our room was nothing but roof in which I requested to be roomed in the TOWER!!!.... Didn't happen... So crowded... I regret... There are lots of hotels that similar to their price range yet very clean and quite... Never stay there again.. Never...
Clerks are rude! Hotel is dirty, dingy and 30 years out of date.  Buffet is no better than dog food and they charge a $14.50 resort fee for each day of your stay but they dont tell upfront.  Dont stay in the manor rooms. They are unsafe! People hanging out all hours of the night. Security is needed during the evening. This hotel is not for children!
I mean this is my first time here everything is good except the WiFi it sucks I can't do anything. FIX THE WIFI, PLEASE.
Fun and excitement - this is a one stop shop hotel. Maybe old but fun for the kids. Cheap rooms.
The hotel was PACKED with kids I stayed in the west tower the room decor was old fashioned look like something out of the 70s it had a handicap accessible shower my wife and I aren't handicap though... . . The lady in the check in desk asked us how we were doing my wife responded im that we just got married her immediate reaction was "we don't have comps" like wtf no one asked you for one followed by a congratulations  . . All in all the staff was Meh the hotel was old I would only recommend if you have kids with you and you want to stay somewhere you can entertain them other than that avoid.
My friend got in a fight with his girlfriend I needed somewhere to stay for the weekend he to get away from her he asked me to stay with him just so you have someone to talk to you plus I just got out of the hospital and he wanted to catch up and hang out with me I was so uncomfortable and that hotel room and kind of felt so Yucca even touching the remote control that I couldn't stay there I literally treated him paid for the hotel for the night and met him in the morning for lunch. Stay at this hotel if you like dumb kids screaming and jumping on your crap and if you like to step in gum and if you like dirty hotel rooms we can totally despicably old coffee.
We have been trying to stay away from booking this hotel but we were on a budget and we wanted a quick weekend getaway.   We had a comp night through the MyVegas slots game so we decided to cash in.   We booked the comp room plus we added one extra night.   . . I was really having second thoughts about staying here, I hate going to Vegas and stayingt at Circus Circus since there are a lot of families with small children.  YES I am not a fan of seeing people with strollers walking around a casino.  Ugh .... anywayssss . . The check in clerk was really nice she smiled and didnt take forever to get our room keys.   Our room was nice looks like it had been upgraded, we had a West Tower room and we really loved it.  I was impressed with the bell staff.  Didn't eat at the hotel since we had purchased buffet passes at MGM Grand through the MyVegas which were easy to use.  The Casino can use an upgrade it looked exactly the same as it did 25 years ago during my very first Vegas trip.     I will def stay here again!
Didn't stay here for our hotel (we stayed at the Tropicana and enjoyed it there) but did bring our daughter here for the SUPER cheap souvenirs all in one place, and the game mezzanine. I do wish we would have found out when the performers would have been on the trapeze, as I think she really would have liked it. It skeeved my husband out since there was no natural light anywhere and an older horror-movie feel to the worn look of everything, but all in all we enjoyed it. The game area was a little dingy and un-loved, but the girl behind the counter was really sweet, and even gave my 3-year-old a few free pieces of candy when what she wanted was exactly the number of tickets she had. If you're looking for a place to let your kid run a little free with a few bucks, this is a good option.
