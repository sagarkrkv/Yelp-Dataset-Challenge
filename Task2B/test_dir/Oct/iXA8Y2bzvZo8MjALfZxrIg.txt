One word. Nachos. The end. Oh, and get the blender margarita to accompany. I can't comment on any other of the food offerings since I have never had any of them, don't need to. This place is so much fun especially on the upstairs patio on a beautiful day with my Hubs.
I give the lunch a five star because of Sean, our waiter.  I am going on a limb, but would say this is the best waiter I have ever had.  He was very attentive and made sure that we were good.  In Vegas, I can find people to be numb to good service.  He went above and beyond.
We were in Las Vegas over the summer, and as you can guessit was hot!  We were not able to get into our hotel for a few more hours..... The world cup was on t.v. and we were hungry -what to do? What to do? Find a place that has the game on and some decent food that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and find it quick.  . We checked out a few places, but wound up at MARGARITAVILLE .  I don't know about decor and such but the food was great,the price was right and the service from FRAN (the bartender) perfect!  We were able to sit at the bar , watch the game , and enjoy our lunch and some tasty margaritas! They even had a "sample" tray -where we tried four 5 oz. margaritas-(perfect for me who was trying margaritas for the first time) wasn't sure I would love them but I did! .  As I said before FRAN -the bartender -made the whole experience perfect! When we sat at the bar he asked what he could get us to drink-I said I need food now drinks later.  He was quick to take our order , get it into the kitchen and before I knew it I was happily eating my lunch.  Followed up by those tasty 5oz. Margaritas I meantioned earlier:) . We enjoyed the whole experience and would happily return anytime we are in the area!
The environment was fun and touristy! I remember coming here to dance all night but have never eaten here until now. Great service from Sabrina, who checked on us frequently. The volcano burger which I have attached a pic needed to be devoured in to four parts.  The fries were a little cold and dry. The seafood Mac and cheese which I also took a pic of was also delicious with the lemon and some pepper to add as it tasted a bit bland. But overall we had a great experience!
Order two margaritas for ($23)Add Nachos ($16) waiter notices you have finished your drinks and raves about their "Wasting Away" margarita which you order being thirsty and a bit tipsy. He brings a fake blender full of pink colored liquid ($33) You notice almost everyone in the place has done the same. The bill comes to $72.00 and you haven't had dinner yet!  You don't seem to care and imagine you have "gone sailing" like Jimmy Buffet says on the loud speakers.
Wow! Jimmy wasn't kidding about The Cheeseburger in Paradise!! Seriously so #delicious! This was my first time dining here for lunch. It was a Sunday and fairly busy when we arrived. We sat on the third floor patio. The seats quickly got taken at the tables near us as well as the bar. This didn't distract or impede on the attention our server gave us. She was very thorough with making sure we got what we wanted, needed, and ordered. She double checked with my order to follow up with my gluten allergy. . Everyone enjoyed their meals of fish sandwich, corn chowder, Cesar salad, jambalaya, and another Cheese Burger in Paradise. . Loved the extra dill pickles on the side.
I had supper tonight at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  It seemed like a fun place ... and it was.. . There is music constantly going along with videos.. . I had a Landshark Lager.. . There are three pirates on stilts who go around making balloon animals, hats, etc.  Every hour at the top of the hour, they play Buffett's Volcano and Margaritaville and the stilted pirates gather.  Then a girl climbs a ladder above the bar and goes into a volcano and comes out in a bikini.  She comes down a slide and lands in some water and does some Cirque du Soleil moves.  Then she dances for a bit.. . I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, minus the green beans (so they gave me extra mashed potatoes, though I didn't eat them all).  Real chicken rather than processed ... yay!  Though it was good, I found it all a bit too salty.. . Maria was my server and she took good care of me.. . There was a band coming on about 11 but I was too tired to hang around for them. . . There is a gift shop and casino right next door.
