Very nice hotel.. Have stayed here any times, every year actually.. Very friendly from the front end staff to housekeeping.. Started this trip at different hotel but ended up back at the Mandalay.. Lots of pools, wave pool, lazy river and of course every game you want to play in the casino.. I have only been hit on by one hooker so far, better than any other hotel I've been in here.. So I guess security is good here too.
Beautiful Hotel Accomodations and Excellent Services!. Pool side fun for all ages from Toddler, Teens to Adults. Mandalay Bay has the most fun pools. The Wave pool for older kids.  Lazy River for Toddler to Adults, just relaxing in the Tube.  . Fun Fun Fun!
I enjoyed the resort and agree with the other reviewers:. . 1.  great swimming pool area . 2.  good for kids. 3.  free tram to get you on the strip . 4.  free self parking is available . . the rooms could be a little cleaner.  as you would expect everything is pricey here
The rooms are clean & the towers are well split, so we never had to wait long to get a elevator to our room.. . In spite of the drought, I admit on yelp...on record...that I took a swim in the tub...thrice in 2 days.  There's even a small tv that you can watch while soaking in the tub!  Their rooms & bathroom are immaculately clean. . . When I booked, I received a $50 hotel credit & we used it on breakfast.  $26 steak & eggs and the $20 American breakfast (eggs & sausage) with a $9 bloody mary.  The delivery / cover charge was $9.  There is more than enough hash browns & eggs for 1 person.  As a after thought, I should've ordered the waffle which came a la carte & just snagged some hash browns from the Hubs.  If you're hung over, its a great option.  If you are not, I would suggest using the credit in one of their restaurants.  The food itself is just ok.. . The pools fill up fast during the peak hours.  The lazy river was packed with both party goers & families alike.  I wish there was more  spacing available, we ended up just hanging out and never got a lounge chair.. . Overall, this one of my new fave places to stay.
Ventilation is horrible. I feel like I smoked 3 packs of cigarettes just walking across the casino. Need major upgrade.
For an older hotel at the farther end of The Strip, Mandalay Bay is pretty decent.  . . The lobby is spacious and there's always something new to see.  I like how there are a lot of dining options since Mandalay Bay is a bit farther than where all the trendy hipster places are.  Want to switch up the scenery?  Head over to Luxor which is conveniently an escalator ride away.  You can also head over to Excalibur and take their tram but why would you want to?  :x. . The rooms itself are spacious.  While almost as old as Monte Carlo, it's definitely in better shape.  The carpet and furniture could probably use a bit of a deep-cleaning but the grand downy bed makes up for it.  I could have used more pillows though since I never use the gross body pillow or the decorative ones in fear of how dirty they are and such.  There's a huge tub in the bathroom and Lush Cosmetics downstairs.  Do the math.  Bath time fun, babie!  I only wish it was a fancy Japanese jacuzzi tub like at Cosmo.  Ooh lah lah.. . Some cons though: Ridiculously thin the walls are.  I could hear the people next door opening their curtains and showering!  Not to mention all the loud drunk people walking up and down the hallways at night and in the morning.  The toilet is also insanely loud.  Since they have the throne room separate from the rest of the bathroom, it's even louder.  Like seriously, I thought I went deaf the first time I flushed.. . If Mlife didn't comp us our room though, I'm not sure I would stay here.  It's a bit of a slower pace but who needs slow when you're in Vegas?
Do not use their Valet Service!  My stay at Mandalay Bay would have been a good one easily resulting in return trips.  However, they ruined their prospects for future business after my last experience with them.. . On Monday, October 6, 2014 I took my rental car to Mandalay Bay to check in for a four night stay.  At the time, the car was fully functioning and had no damage.  The keys were handed to the valet at that time.  During my stay I did not use my vehicle and did not take the car off of the premises.  While my car was in their possession, it managed to end up with a flat tire on the driver's side.. . As we were checking out and getting our car from valet, the valet attendant delivered my rental with a nearly flat tire and directed us to the nearest gas station for air.  After attempting to fill our tire with air, we ultimately had to return the car to the airport and get a new car.  During that process, we promptly contacted Mandalay Bay and were put on hold for more than an hour and a half getting the run around from everyone ranging from the Valet desk, front desk, operator, and MLife desk with no one taking any responsibility for damage to our car.. . After finally reaching their Valet Manager (Rick), we were then treated disrespectfully and offered no resolution to our wasted time and issues encountered.  We then contacted thehotel again and asked to speak with guest relations.  We asked for a small comp for our troubles and bad customer service experience.  We were told we wanted a response within 48 hours as we were staying at another MGM property and wanted to be able to apply any comps given to our stay at that new resort.  As of today we have not received any follow up information.. . I look forward to being able to update this review with a compliment indicating how Mandalay Bay was able to rectify the situation.  If I do hear from them, I will update my review.
Well, on the 30th day we had to reach out again to hotel and Risk Management.  We were told they were viewing the video from the pool that day and the only part they could see was my mom being taken away on the stretcher to the ambulance... The reason we were given for this was that there is only a revolving camera in the pool area.  I then proceeded to call security and see what kind of cameras are located at the pool and the confirmed that there are fixed cameras by the wave pool along with a revolving one.  I just think it is awful that we are lied to.  We have never one asked that they claim liability for the fall itself but to step up and apologize andoffer something toward her $40,0000 medical bills, pain and just pure lack of care or compassion from any of the staff of risk management.  They have agreed to remove part of the room charges which is nice, but I feel if they truly cared, they could have done a lot more.  Im sure this is a fine hotel( if you don't get hurt),  but know I and none of my family or friends will ever step foot in any MGM resort after how this was handled.
I want to update my review based on Mandalay Bay's response.  After emailing several contacts I found online, I finally got a response.  Mandalay Bay encouraged me to file a claim with risk management and also gave me a $240 credit off of my previous stay.  The amount was credited back to my credit card already.  I appreciate the quick response.. . I was at Mandalay Bay for a trade show and this place is a good location for a trade show.  Rooms are nice, nothing special.  Food options for the trade show were good, and I will review each individual location separately.
Looking for a clean, hip, friendly experience... Mandalay is a great choice. Shows, premier dining, friendly staff, pools and more.  . Came here for a real estate training and the convention center was a few minute walk which made things easy and fast. . Sand beach & lazy river at the pool was rockin. A large venue to have just about any type of function. . Love to be back soon!
I got my car valet parked, and it was fast and the valet guy, Dominic I think his name was, was awesome, great customer service!
My girlfriend and I were in town for the week. We stayed at Aria Monday through Friday and generally had a WONDERFUL experience there. We had some friends whom we did not know were coming to town show up on Fridayand we decided to extend our stay through the weekend at Mandalay, as this was where they were staying. Unless this was our ONLY option in Vegas, never again.. . We booked a standard room initially that morning, no problem. At check in, I asked for an upgrade, which was given at an increased cost. We were extremely disappointed with this. The room only had HALF a window, and the view was near the dining room table which overlooked a roof! Why pay the upgrade, needless to say I wasn't in the mood to bitch and moan and wanted to enjoy my birthday. Moreover, we had tipped our check in associate, Whitney, ($50), for being what we thought was so accommodating. Moreover, she'd indicated that y'all would send up some sort of birthday basket or something along those lines which isn't a big deal, but DON'T say you're going to do something and never deliver.. . The trip only got worse. Saturday evening, my girlfriend had worn heels all week and thus had some blisters on her feet. We called down for band aids (as we had done at Aria with NO issues) and we were told we had to come get them! So, after my girlfriend gets off the phone, I call down, and then have to yell to get them to bring us band aids. Are you joking? Get off your ass and bring them to your guests. THEN, the cable goes out in our room and we have to call for that, which was addressed promptly, due to the "loose" cable. . . At the end of the day, for an older property on the strip, your service should set you apart and it's unfortunate because I know people whom only stay at Mandalay in Vegas, for which I'm certainly perplexed. Aria and the Wynn are MUCH better properties.
We stayed here one night during our cross-country trip. The room was really nice and very clean. The hotel itself seemed a little too spread out, and was difficult to find our tower. Once we found the tower everything was great. Good food in the shops attached and the casino was pretty nice too. I would come back here.
I've stayed here on my past three trips to Las Vegas and am always pleased with the consistency. While newer properties abound, I like the proximity to the airport, the pool scene, and the size of the guest rooms. Check-in, for me, has always been prompt and efficient, and valet service was very good on my most recent stay. The casino is pretty average, and the sports book is large and inviting. Nice place to sleep and relax poolside, gambling is better elsewhere.
A very  nice and clean hotel. The pool area is truly the highlight of the hotel with a wave pool and a lazy river. It's like a water park. They also have great  refillable drink  specials  at the pool. You almost never need to leave because the hotel has so many resturant clubs and lounges. Everything vegas is about in one place.
I've previously stayed at THEHotel (which I think has been rebranded to something else) which is the all suite tower, but this was my first stay at the main hotel. . . Check-in: the lines weren't that long and overall the process was fast. We did have checked bags (we arrived at 9 in the morning and checked into our room that afternoon) that took a while to get up to our room.. . Room: good size, niceand clean, overall appealing look. Contemporary but comfortable. I would say the rooms are a step above Luxor, NYNY, MGM, basically nicer than the other hotels in close proximity. The water pressure in the shower was good. Nothing worse than recovering from a hangover and not being able to take a decent shower.. . Amenities: Mandalay has an awesome pool (I have a separate review for it), they have a HUGE casino floor (I'm not a big gambler, so I can't go into many of the details), and plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. Two of my favorite restaurants on The Strip are here, so I'm a happy camper :). . So why only 3 stars? I was disappointed with the concierge. We went to concierge to buy some show tickets. We didn't really know what we wanted to see and it was sort of last minute and the process was excruciatingly slow. To make matters worse, we were told to go to the wrong casino and when we checked in at the box office to pick up our tickets we were told we needed to go somewhere entirely different. The hassle of rushing to Rio from Caesar's was a pain and we missed the beginning of the show. When I contacted someone about this they didn't even offer an apology.
Surprised at how dead this place has gotten, but not as much since it is soooo stinking far on the strip, and all the action is in the center. I don't like the smell of this place, and the choice of slot machines was mediocre. Lots of good restaurants here though!
My wife and I have been to Mandalay Bay 5 times now and there is a reason we keep coming back. The staff at Mandalay is first rate. Always friendly, always willing to help, always have a positive attitude, I love it. The rooms are always clean and on the high end, even with a basic King room, the amenities are great. The pool is one of the best in Vegas, whether you're in the wave pool, the lazy river, or one of the other pools you can't go wrong.  Finally, it's less crowded than many of the other hotels on the strip maybe because it's at the end and that's just fine with me. We will go back again!
I guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others. And what makes Mandalay Bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach. Kick back relax enjoy the water and the live DJ music.
I stay here once a year because of a work conference.  The rooms are fine and you know things are going to be expensive since its Vegas.  But I'm giving the poor rating because they've changed their room service to 'deli' service where your food arrives in plastic and paper.  But they didn't drop the prices.  They charged me $46 for a cold burger that arrived in plastic containers and for a packaged bag of chips.  Not cool!!!
I'm surprised at the low reviews for this place but I thought it was great! The room was beautiful and we had a huge bathtub with jets woo! Also there's so much to do at Mandalay. I highly recommend the aquarium, because come on. Also some of the food options in the hotel are very choice. Oh yeah! And they have have a huge pool area with a wave pool,lazy river and multiple other pools. What more do you people want!?!?! 4 stars
