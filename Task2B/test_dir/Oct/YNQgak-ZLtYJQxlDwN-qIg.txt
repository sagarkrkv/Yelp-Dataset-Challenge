We have a fantastic brunch here before we leave Las Vegas!!!!! I love the decoration in the garden area,thou it's plastic flower...and they don't serve seafood for brunch, but the smoked salmon tastes good! And there is some seaweed in the Japanese food area which surprised me!!! And also tastes good! My mum and I ate lots of that!!lol and the dessert area,enough for brunch..ice-cream is cute..umm the service is also good!!
We love The Buffet at Wynn. We ate here twice on vacation. Lunch and dinner and we were impressed AS USUAL. Always a big selection of tasty foods. The deserts are exquisite. The Buffet at Wynn is my go - to even when I don't stay at the Wynn. The only buffet that is comparable at the time is at Aria.
Came for brunch Saturday and there was maybe a 5 minute wait, albeit this is in October.. . Feel like these type of buffets are honestly worth it, even though every dish may not be amazing. You get to try so many creative dishes for $30-40 which would be almost as much as one dish at any other fine dining restaurant, and even less nicer places, since every place on the strip is pretty much overpriced.. . Compared to the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo, the Buffet had fewer options and service was lacking, but the quality of the food and dishes were better and more thoughtful. Also, it's great that they are friendly to those with specific food preferences.. . Our waters were rarely refilled, as we never saw our waiter, but our empty plates were almost always taken away, when we returned for more consumption. The table next to us even had to ask a hostess to get more water and be attended to.. . I would like to check out their dinner, as I don't care too much for pastries, waffles, and pancakes, but it was nice to see many other offerings, that are more lunch based. Sushi rolls were fine, and were made with less rice than those at Wicked spoon. The shrimp egg roll was surprisingly good, filled with an abundance of shrimp meat. I enjoyed their seaweed salad, kimchi, and lox and bagels (with all the fixings). Their cocktail shrimp was also better than those at the Cosmo. What I was most impressed with was that they had congee! This is a staple traditional Chinese breakfast item. Not only did they have congee, but it was offered with the authentic condiments: 1000 year old egg, what they call a "Chinese doughnut", etc. and it was all actually quite good. . . Their mango tangerine sorbet was very refreshing and tasty. The passion fruit tapioca was very good. However, the candy apple while beautiful was inedible. The candy shell was impenetrable for me.
Yuck.... dont waste your time your money
For the price and the quality it was far from impressive.  We went here for my mom's birthday and the food was lackluster.  For the amount that you pay for a buffet, the Indian Casinos in California have better quality than the food in Vegas.. I mean this place is in the Wynn and I sure didn't feel like I won anything, It seemed more like a Loss.. The steak was dry and rubbery, the gespacho was served in small containers (which was a great idea because it was disgusting).  The handroll ...you should steer clear of because it tastes nothing like Japanese.  The seafood was far from impressive too.  Just a poor all around buffet with subpar service.. I'm pretty sure that when it comes to food service, they take a course in food microbiology.  When clearing out dishes please don't just take the dishes and plop the utensils on the table.. For one, ask the person if it's ok to take the dishes.. Secondly, when you put the utensils on the table, the table isn't 100% clean...do you expect me to put it back in my mouth?  . There is a reason I put my utensils on an unused dish...I would like to avoid food born illness.. Please just ask customers if it's ok to take away the dishes, otherwise I will ask you for more utensils and you'll be annoyed that I bothered you for extra silverware when we could have avoided this by you just simply asking.. This was a disappointing birthday dinner for my mom and  all of us as well.
Loved loved the buffet, which had so many selections.  Only thing was I wish their oysters were fresher and that there was nigiri.  But overall beautiful experience.  Great desserts! Crepe bar!  Lunch for $32.99, dinner for $40.99.
I don't know why this buffet only has 3 stars! It is soooo good! They have all the buffet foods I would eat + more! My favorite part about it is that they have a ramen bar. I didn't expect the ramen to be good because it was a buffet, but I decided to try it anyway and man was I surprised! It was pretty darn good! Plus, this buffet costs less than the other ones.
Its good for buffet standards.  This was comped because i lost a lot of money in slots. Speaking of the slots in the Wynn are very very rough dont be a fool like me and dump in 2 months of rent money...
What's there to offer those of us who don't want 6 month old frozen crab legs?. . What happened to this place?! At $45/person, I wouldn't say the food was much better than the Golden Corral, albeit slightly better selection! It's been about 2yrs since I last visited, and boy has this place gone downhill!. . The tuna/seawood dish comes in a little sauce dish, and there were only 4 little pieces of tuna, smaller than the sugar cubes you would drop in your coffee. I got sick from eating the raw oysters. The fish was dry because it has been sitting too long. They don't rotate the fried chicken, so it's the same few pieces sitting there for an hour. The pizza was depressing. and the ice cream wasn't very creamy at all. Plus the veggies were limp.. . The marinated rib eye was pretty good. The creme brulee was pretty good, as was the choco chip cookie, but for what I paid, I don't see the value. Very disappointed, because this place was supposed to offer a premium product, being associated with the Wynn name and all. Maybe this was why there was 0 wait time when I got here Friday night at 6pm? And to think at one time, this was one of my fave buffets of all time. Sad...
$39 per person is absolutely not worthy.  The crab legs are very salty and small like regular sizes and serve COLD.   The soups are so plain, not good, sushi is the worst, just the salads are fresh. Not worth the waits either.  Don't waist your money and time here.  If you are Asian,  you can tell the Asian foods are HORRIBLE!  Period.  Don't try.
I'll keep it concise.  The food is just not good, at all, period.  Little or no selection on anything, i wouldn't pay more than $10 for this buffet (Lunch price is $27).. . I'm starting to think the Wynn has no standards when it comes to their dinning (See my review of Botero, their "fancy" steak restaurant).. . Disgusting.
The Wynn Buffet has always been on my list and I finally had a chance to try it out when we visited Vegas the last time. The decor inside the buffet is absolutely stunning!!! This place is a must for anyone visiting Vegas. Though compared to other buffets, they didn't have a huge selection of dishes to choose from, the food quality was pretty good. It's definitely worth checking out at least once when your in Vegas!
Came here a few months ago and while the food was ok, our initial encounter with the cashier wasn't a good one as she accused us of cutting in line when we just tried to walk around a crowd who was trying to figure out payment...fast forward a few months later...we had 2 comps for the buffet...spoke to the manager who verified the comps...he was quite a character..too many red bulls or not enough meds who knows but he reminded me of a disney character, he was also very polite and welcoming. our server was very nice and attentive, quickly clearing plates and offering refills. Some of the food was good but others were disappointing...the dumplings appeared and tasted like they had been there for hours and hours, a lot of the items were a hit or miss especially the Asian ramen station. Their prime rib and crabs legs however were pretty good. The decor in here is very inviting and warm so it's a pleasant place to just eat in however for the prices charged I think it still has some work to do as I've encountered cheaper buffets with better food, thankfully this was a comped meal.
We came here after a long day at the trade show floor and were starving! So the idea of a dinner buffet obviously got our team excited. We called ahead of time to see if there was a long line which they said there wasn't and by the time we got there (I swear 5 mins later), there was a huge line! Do not trust the staff at theserestaurants in Vegas when you ask about wait time - it's never right!! Always assume a wait or make reservations ahead of time.. . The manager there was very accommodating as we were a large group and people were coming in and out at different times. Selection of food was good but the servers took forever to clear our plates so we would come back to our table with stacks of uncleared plates. Regardless, we were so hungry that everything tasted amazing. We felt like savages and despite sitting by the entrance where everyone can see us like zoo animals, we just didn't care.
Visited the Wynn buffet for brunch on a Saturday. Stood through the usual line and was seated in requested dining area. I was underwhelmed by the brunch buffet, and would only consider visiting for normal lunch or dinner. We paid ~$33/person. For this, I would rather go out for a nice brunch where I can specify a dish and it be made to order for me. It felt like this brunch buffet's dazzle effect wore off.. . The atmosphere was clean and service responsive. The main buffet area is dimly lit which makes me feel like I'm walking into a cave, or a recovery bubble after a long "Vegas" night. Overall the stations are kept clean and well stocked.. . There were a number of stations dedicated to breakfast offerings such as fresh pancakes, eggs and egg whites, bacon, french toast, and smoked salmon and bagels. Consider coming here on a weekday if you would like to avoid these dishes.. . Now back to lunch. There was two soup offerings. There were salad options including a glass filled with cherry tomatoes, celery and carrots. The celery had brown on it. There was a mescaline, red beet and tangerine salad in individual serve dishes. There was a charcuterie areas with two types of cheeses and two types of salamis; smoked mozzarella and a plain looking yellow cheddar. This was really disappointing because I can get these offerings at home from a supermarket.. . The meat offerings were carved ham, carved prime rib and carved turkey breast. All of these meats were delicious and I would say highlights of the buffet. Seafood was limited; only bulk shrimp were available. There were a variety of "international" stations as well; Asian with wontons and a congee stand; Mexican inspired, and Japanese with sushi. . . The variety is great, but none of the dishes were amazing, which defeats the purpose of having such a variety. An example of this is the shrimp tempura sushi. There was very little shrimp tempura and avocado and A LOT of rice. No one eats maki rolls for the rice! I would have preferred to see a number of well executed dishes, vs. a few highlights and a bunch of mediocre food for the masses reminiscent of standards that nice Chinese buffets now even surpass.. . Dessert stations was very large. My favorite was the bread pudding - hands down best of the mini desserts. All of these mini cakes look very beautfiul and appealing, but they don't taste amazing or like desserts worth eating. This go around they had a raspberry cake, strawberry shortcake, chocolate cake, etc. Another notable dessert was a tapioca pudding with a passion fruit glaze- yum!
4.25 . . Bancchial is better but the brunch here is neck to neck with the bancchial in terms of quality with less of a wait but less selection. Located in the wynn hotel its not as central compared to the other big hotels and you may need to take the bus if walking is not your thing. Very vast selection and I particularly liked their smoked salmon bruscuetta bread. Decent prime rib and lamb but sushi was subpar. Overall a very above average buffet.
I was disappointed with The Buffet. It is large and relatively diverse, but all of the dishes were fairly generic, and totally unremarkable. Not a single dish stood out. Food quality was decent, but I've certainly eaten at much more upscale Vegas buffets (eg Bellagio). I expected more from a Wynn property. . . Service was good but the price was no bargain at $39.95+ on a weekday night. . . With so many better choices of buffet and traditional restaurants here, I would not repeat.
The food was so-so, some things were great tasting, other things weren't that good at all.. . This place has really gone down hill since when they first opened up what like 7-8 years ago?  . . The service was awesome and very spot on, the variety and selection of food wasn't anything great, nor did they have anything out of the ordinary that other places down the road didn't have.. . Nor sure I will come back unless they redo the food spread.
My favorite buffet restaurant ever! They have my favorite creme brulee they never fail me on that one. Service is excellent. Food is awesome. The place is 5star! A bit pricey but worth it! We always go here whenever we visit vegas during our stay at wynn. Best buffet and hotel in vegas.
This place rocks! I don't know what everyone else who gave this place a low score is talking about, especially those who say Bacchanal is better.If you're splurging on a buffet in Vegas, then make the right choice and go here.
If you are vegetarian or vegan, I cannot reccomend this place enough! When we mentioned our dietary requirements to the hostess, she called the chef. The chef came out and walked us through the entire buffet, pointing out which items contained animal products and which did not. She also offered that several items could be made vegan upon request. Everything was delicious and the service was outstanding. It's a little pricey, but honestly not bad at all compared to other buffet options on the strip.
