Had the pleasure of having dinner here.. I have been to Joe's in Chicago quite a few times and it is one of my favorite spots. We were hoping this outpost was just as good.. Started with cocktails....very nice.. Had salads & steaks and they were pretty darn good. Steaks cooked perfectly.. Service was good and attentive. . Joe's of Las Vegas: You are A-OK in my book of places to eat. Not quite as good as my Chicago locale but very close. Good job!. . Cheers to all
I wish I knew about this place years ago. I came here with about 12 people and there service was unbelievable.. Now, I know it's expected to be this way for the price but they did an exceptional job regardless we all felt like we had one server dedicated to each of us.. . The food was all amazing and I'm going to be back here next time I go to Vegas. Well worth the price.
Worst service EVERRRRRR!!!! Great food and all, but sooo disrespectful!!!! I could of went to McDonald's and got a better service!. . RSVP for 8:30pm, got our seat around 8:40. Our waiter came at 9, to take our order. Started with "what can I get you guys," but before we ordered, we had questions because its our first time here. But he looked like he didn't want to be at our table. More like he wanted to be at his other tables aka rich people tables. We look very young, celebrating our 1st year anniversary, maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him as much as those "other people". We are still customer, show us some respect will you!!! . . so continuing, I asked about this certain dish that has salmon in it. it was called " salmon de ...something", but when I asked about it, he replied "you don't know what a salmon is?" SERIOUSLY, WOW great job Sherlock. of course, I know what a salmon is, but what's the dish about. is it...cooked, grilled, fried, seared, what!?!?!?! . . *CLANK* So ordering is done. So my GF and I were talking while we were waiting for our food to come. And here comes our waiter out of no where with these metal bowls for our discarding shells, but he threw it on out table making this loud clanking noise. *CLANK*!!! no sorry, or excuse me, just "here are these for your shells." . . Just wanted a fancy dinner and celebrate our 1 year!!! I did not wanted this kind of experience on our special day!!!
Excellent meal.   Service and atmosphere was also very good.  I had the roasted black cod and my wife had the scallops on pancetta.   Portions quite small.  Everything ala carte here which we knew before dining.  We had 2 sides:  the sweet potato and pan fried broccolini.   Both were excellent.   The waiter was promoting a wine @$65/ bottle.  We chose the Tobin James "Notorious" Cabernet @$ 50 which was excellent.  . . We dined  At Spago the next night.   The food and service were better.
I had the best lunch today at joes. Simple and straight forward food. Wait staff was awesome and the atmosphere is great. FYI The burger is the best lunch value on the menu.
This atmosphere is one of the best in Vegas. A Miami favorite is just as popular here any given night this place could be sold out. Obviously great for flavorful crab but their steak options are also too notch. Great professional service. Tim and Gabe the maitre d's absolutely the best.
Was to die for!  We had a Filet, the Lamb and the Seared Ahi.  Sides were Onion Strings, Creamed Spinach and the Macaroni and Cheese.  All was amazing, but seriously, the Macaroni!!  Would always go back.
Great restaurant in the caesars forum shopps. Glad to see i didnt have to fly to miami to have my stone crab! We usually see someone famous when we dine here! Love the stone crab and joes special sauce!! Great bloody marys too!
Went to Caesars last weekend and didnt know where we were going to eat - until the desk clerk said they have a Joes Stone Crab!  DONE!. The 20 minute walk through the shops was forever (take the shortcut outside the front of the casino - 5 minutes) but when we got there, it made it worthwhile.. We were disappointed to hear that the Crab was out of season but our server suggested the steak - which we ordered.. The service could not have been better - the drinks perfect and the steak.....I would order again and again and again!. In my opinion, this is one of the top restaruants at Caesars - even though they are NOT affiliated with the hotel other than renting space (you cannot charge it to your room).
Aahhhhhmmmaaaazzzziiiiinnggg!!!  Our server was Peter and he made sure we had a enjoyable dinner.  He was very knowledgeable and a pleasure to talk too.  Those Stone Crabs, Salads and Steaks were Devine!!  My only regret was not saving any room for dessert.
This place didn't look like that much to me, being in a mall and all, but boy was I wrong. . . Fabulous dinner with a very knowledgeable and competent wait staff. The seafood, especially the oysters, were second to none. There wasn't a bad thing on the table, and with a decent sized group, we had lots of different items on the table. . . The wine offerings were nice and also complemented the food very nicely. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire experience.
Being from the Midwest I always tend to miss restaurants with a home town feel and thankfully Joe's has always continued the void for this "lobster neck"..From the familiar face of the maitre de or a regular waiter/waitress in Vegas Joe's always feels like home and you can't put a price on that!. . I realize since my initial review I have had a few trips back and neglected to update..For anyone who seeks a "what to try"..You must MUST try the stone crab claws..They come semi cracked and it does involve a bit of effort to indulge in the crabby goodness, but believe me it's well worth it from any horizon of that sea!. . Other notables are my favorite famous scallops..I'm not sure what it is about the preparation, but they just simply are the best I have been able to find to date and it's always a staple on my visit to Vegas, no questions asked..They are just tender to perfection and need no condiment or seasoning to knock even Caesar off this palace thrown! . . Another crowd pleaser which my wife and I were going nautical over was the madagascar shrimp..The head and tail are removed table side which is like Benihana meets Red Lobster, but paired with some key lime aioli and it'll leave you tickled pink to the gills!. . Also to wash down the meal dessert wise go for the banana cream pie I raved about before and rave about now..I can never get enough of it with the banana foster sauce drizzled everywhere..I have asked and in true Marie Calendar fashion the pies do have the ability to be bought in full and taken back to the hotel room which blows my mind..Oh the damage in a hotel room that could do (c'mon they've seen worse so don't judge)..Haha. . All I can say is for about $30 a person you create an experience and if you go enough like myself you leave a lasting impression apparently..It truly is a trip when you have a waiter stop and say they remember waiting on you many months prior which is a rarity in the Vegas scene!
Let me preface the comment with this statement "I hate going to the strip". With that said . I love going to Joes. You can valet right outside the mall and walk directly to the restaurant. Next lets talk about the food. Always excellent. The steaks are cooked just the way you order. I really enjoy the Mahi tacos and Chilean sea bass. Seafood is fresh, no fishy smell or taste. Ive also had the ribeye cheesesteak. I must say simply wonderful sandwich. Now the caveat is you are going to pay for such good food, be prepared to spend some cash
went here for some crabs!. . they were out of stone crabs so we got rock crab instead.  pretty good.  I still want to try stone crab though since its in their name so it must be what they're known for.. . we got 24 oysters. wow they were soo good and fresh! must get if you come here.. . we also got like a seafood sampler.  the seafood tasted fresh and I really liked the scallops cerviche.. . I also got the bone in rib eye. it was soo good!! very tender and the seasoning was really good.. . also got the mashed potatoes.  it looked pretty fancy.  came with cheese and the crunchy bread crumbs on top.  I didn't like how the cheese got stuck together so I would get this without the cheese on top, or less cheese if you can?. . overall pretty good food
Always a first choice for birthday, anniversary, or just want to treat yourself fancy dinner! Service is very friendly and attentive. Be sure to make reservations and ENJOY !
Literally only went here for desert and a coffee.  The Key lime pie was PERFECT.  Out of this world!! I highly recommend getting it!
I was rather disappointed with the food. Very expensive, and not that tasty. I was with a party of 6 and that was the general consensus. If you want steak there are plenty of other options in town.
Some may find this hard to believe but finding fresh seafood in the desert is rather difficult....  This is a personal favorite of mine and is arguably the best restaurant in town. The halibut and dover sole (filet table side) are true standouts. Always fresh never frozen...simple, but often missed with most places out here....
