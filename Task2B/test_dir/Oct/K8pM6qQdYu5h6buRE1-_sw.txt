Came to Lolos Sunday morning. First time coming here I expected great service and amazing food. Service was really poor and the wait was super long not only did they take about 30+ min to sit us our food took over 40 min to come out after ordered, not once did we get an apology!! As for the food it was ok! Coming from working in a restaurant environment customer service should def be a top priority.
The food was amazing! The chicken is amazing, the warm maple syrup and the various southern side dishes are all wonderful. Jake an was our server and he was incredibly attentive, personable and knowledgable. Definitely will be back soon!!
The biscuits and gravy are very good. Greeter was friendly to us and we didn't wait long to be seated at lunch. The food took a while coming out.  The new location is much more spacious and very nicely decorated in that southern style. I would give them 4 stars if service was a bit faster and if our waiter checked on us more and was friendlier. Overall, cool place to eat.
Great atmosphere, great service, good food and one of the best Bread Puddings this side of the Delta.
Food was great as usual.  Love the new building.  However, the chairs are probably the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in and the music was way too loud.  I don't like shouting at my dinner companions to be heard.  Get better chairs and turn it down during dinner time, please.  If it's going to remain that loud, I'll just get my food to go.
My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it.
I don't yelp I've never felt the need to but something this amazing I want to share. Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one.
Very friendly staff and joyful space. Definitely worth the experience, if you've never had chicken and waffles! The combo is delicious. They have other selections of food; Southern comfort food complete with Kool aid and sweet tea :)
Love Lolo's, but they slacked off this morning. Food was a little too greasy for no reason (the eggs and grits), and had to get a scraggler waiter or we wouldn't have got served.... Hit the new Scottsdale location
I liked this place.  The ambiance is nice and the service is superb.  The mojito was delicious and so was the waffles.  My daughter was excited by the red velvet pancakes.  The down side was price - SO EXPENSIVE!  An order of pancakes was $13!  I can't afford to frequent this place very often.
Love this place! The Scottsdale one has much larger chicken legs then the one on central unless it just happened to be a big chicken day. HAHA They just came out with a new menu and there are so many things I want to try but the Chicken and waffles are so darn good I end up getting those every time.  I have tried the sweet potatoes and they were really good too. Always too full for dessert but OMG they look good!. Inexpensive pricing, fast service and they are open on Mondays too!
Not worth it at all! The greens are mediocre and the Mac and cheese is just sad!  I can do better at home!  I will say that the catfish was delicious but the fried chicken was just okay.  The service was SLOW!  I went on a weeknight and the restaurant wasn't that crowded so I don't know why it took so long for mediocre food.
Love this place!!! Excellent southern hospitality! Best sweet tea! Love the collards! And the chicken and waffles is pretty damn good too , j/k, is amazing!!! I get the Chicken Fried Chicken Combo almost every time though (deep fried boneless chicken breast smothered in sausage gravy) just add their house hot sauce and I'm in heaven!!! As a matter of fact, it's lunch time, and that's what I'm gonna get now!
If you do not care how clogged your arteries get and have Ok blood sugar then pig out....I would not call this a good Cajun restaurant but it is on the cusp of Cajun.  It is not expensive and a real Cajun would cost more....but health wise....don't do this too often....it is tasty and if you really need a guilt trip...this place will do it for you...kill yourself but not your children, please.
I've been a fan of LoLo's for years.  No one can match their chicken - absolutely delicious!  Waffles are amazing; thin, light with a hint of cinnamon.  Mac and cheese, red beans and rice are right on the money too!  . . I'm writing this review after having contracted with them to provide catering service for a wedding rehearsal dinner at my home.  Wasn't sure how it would all go, but the sales rep, Toyesha, helped me as I narrowed down my menu selections, and also advised that two of their staff members would be onsite to set up, make the waffles for the guests (so they were fresh, and not rubbery and cold), and help with service.  It was AMAZING, the staff were on time, friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and we all had a great time.  Especially me, because I didn't have to cook or do dishes!. . Bravo to LoLo's!!!
Went here for the first time today and I have to say I'm ashamed of myself for having not been here sooner.. . The place is pretty big and has a great atmosphere! Our server was Steven and he had the most perfect voice! We got our drinks and I had to try the sweet tea. If you're a fan of southern sweet tea, then you will NOT be disappointed. I felt like I was in Georgia when I took that first sip. And they serve drinks in a giant Mason jar!. . We started off with their Stupid Fries and that was super delicious. I had their soul food platter where you can make your own plate. I had the 3 piece chicken with Mac and cheese and potato salad with a corn bread. It came to us hot and quick. The chicken was so flavorful and easy to get off the bone. Wasn't too impressed with the potato salad but omigosh the cornbread! . . Service was pretty good. The waiter took a while to come back to refill drinks. But other than that, I highly recommend coming here. Great for a casual date night, family night, or having a meal with some good friends. Can't go wrong with some good fried chicken and a big Mason jar of sweet tea!
