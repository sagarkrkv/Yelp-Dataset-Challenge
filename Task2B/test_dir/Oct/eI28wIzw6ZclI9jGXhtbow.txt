A nice aprouch for a cirque show!! You are so close to the performance it feels almost to real... extremly funny as long as you leave your inhibitions at home!
Hands down the best show I've seen in Vegas. From the opening act, I was continually astounded at the Feats of Strength (at least that's what I call them), and the set design, costuming and other production values were top notch. I also found the show so hysterically funny that I had difficulty staying on my chair. Anais Thomassian deserves special recognition; I was unfamiliar with this comedic actress, but her sense of timing and verbal skills were fantastic.. . If, on the other hand, you answered the question on your Yelp profile about the last great book you read with "The Bible," you may want to skip this one.
Awesome!!!! I would go a second time, this was hysterical and impressive! I was in tears from laughing so hard and felt bad for not clapping at times because I was busy with my hand over my mouth in awe at many stunt (especially the bodygaurds)!  Must see but must have a raunchy and racey sense of humor.
Oh my gosh!! I almost peed myself.  This is the best. It's racist. Sexist.and puppet sex. Penny is wonderful! !
super funny show! Small, but was entertaining though out!
Gonna write it again since my review was posted to my check-in... Goes to show how much I LOVED the show and couldn't wait to post a great review!. . AMAZBALLS!!! A definite must see for those looking for comedy, raunchy humor, and talent. This is more of a variety show with audience participation- making it seem like time went by really fast. . . We bought our tickets at Tix4Tonight near the Paris hotel, but those stands are all over the strip. The ticket price was $90 and that included all taxes and fees, totally worth EVERY penny! If you go through TicketMaster or directly through Cesear's, you're looking at spending about $130+...!. . We were sat on the 6th row and had a great view.  Like every other review on here states, every seat is pretty much great... Those sitting up front will be made fun of... and they don't hold anything back! So be ready! ENJOY!!!
Absolutely Amazing!. . We were surprised by how small and intimate the venue was, but it made the experience so much more enjoyable.. . This is definitely a show for the 18+ crowd who do not get offended easily.  It is raunchy, obscene and all kinds of hilarious fun.  The hosts do an amazing job and entertaining the crowd while acts are prepared, and they clearly do so with a mix of scripted comedy and clever improvisation.. . The acts themselves are everything you would expect from Cirque du Soleil.  Feats that will astound and amaze crowds based on strength, flexibility, concentration and pure talent.  Be prepared for the word 'wow' to involuntarily escape you frequently.. . We got our tickets the day of the show from a Tix4Tonight kiosk so they were also reasonably priced, and the seats themselves were in a good location.
Easily one of my favorite shows.   Hilarious and moves so fast.  Every seat is great.  If I say more I'll ruin it for you.  Just trust me and go.  I've seen it 8 times.  It's just Damn good.  Go go go.   Enjoy it
This is the best live show I have ever attended. If you see one show in your Vegas travels, Absinthe has to be it. Great and engaging from the top of the show to the end.
Vulgar.  Raunchy.  Awkward.. Side-splitting.  Preposterous.  Very funny.. . Warning: those who pride themselves on being virtuous, take themselves as serious-minded, prefer a lecture than a comedy -- need not come.  Then again, maybe you should!  It's sexual, where cabaret meets burlesque meets Cirque du Soleil.. . In a small but amazingly decorate tent in the round on the grounds of Caesars Palace, audience members are 5-30 feet away from the action.  Incredible performances, one after the other and mostly acrobatic in nature varying from tight robe to ribbon to tap, brawn and might, beautiful bodies in action, with comedic hosting by Penny and the Gazillionaire (think Borat), who provide plenty of laughs.. . It's definitely a show I'll remember forever.. . Tip1: If you want to avoid being picked on, sit a few rows back.  If not, beware!. Tip2: Not for kids!. Tip3: Parents who go with the adult children -- not on your life.  Awk!
Not a show for everyone. You have to have a specific vulgar sense of humor to enjoy this show. Do not go here with your parents lol. I loved the performance, the style of the show and extremely inappropriate jokes
I've been to so many shows in Vegas but this one stands out. Why? The laughter from the politically incorrect dialogue and the the mind blowing stunts the performers do. Definitely not for everyone and you do have to have that twisted sense of humor to get all the jokes and be open to the raunchiness. Would watch this show again and again.
It's hard to know what to expect before actually seeing the show, but Absinthe certainly lives up to its raunchy and well-reviewed reputation. Definitely check it out if you're not afraid of penis jokes (lots of them) and x-rated comedy in general. Two older ladies in our row left 20 minutes into the show and never came back LOL.. . Apart from the comedy aspect, the acrobats/performers are truly talented. The roller-skating pair were particularly memorable -- I was cowering in my seat for fear of being walloped by a flying woman.. . We sat in the fourth row and it was plenty close enough, especially if you don't want to get heckled and/or brought up on stage.
This is one of my favorite shows in Vegas. It was so funny and amazing at the same time. Time had gone by so quickly. The only part I really didn't like was the girl in the bubble. I thought the show could've done without this part, but hey, I guess I can't force myself in a bubble. But other than this, the show is perfect for date night after a nice dinner.
Absolutely the best show ever!!!!  I laughed so hard. Penny is so funny. Acts are incredible. Don't miss this show if you like vulgar comedy.
Absinthe is by far the best show I've seen on the strip. It's a great mix of everything - death defying acts, sexy acrobatics, and over the top raunch-com. This show is not for the faint of heart or those that offend easily.  If you like politically incorrect/X-rated humor then this show is for you!  I'll be going back soon.
One of the most amazing shows ever. After reading reviews and in a spur of the moment inclination, my boyfriend and I tried to purchase tickets last minute but they were sold out online. Disappointed by not getting tickets, We decided to walk the strip over to Serendipity, when we came across Absinthe. We decided to check with the box office to see if there were any cancellations, and to our luck, there were several seats available! We snagged them immediately, and decided to get some water, since we could bring our own drinks inside. We went to a small bar close by, right outside the event, and noticed a $20 off discount off Absinthe tickets! We went back to the box office and asked the kind lady if she could still apply the discount and, to our luck, she was! We saved $40 total. . . As far as the show goes, it's amazing. The performances were heart stopping and mind blowing. The host and assistance were hilarious with their crude comedic puns. Definitely not a show for children under 18 because of the revealing costumes and content. Also, this show isn't for people, who get offended easily. They touch upon pretty sensitive topics, so if you're one to be inflexible, I would not suggest coming here. . . Other than that, if you're looking for a show that's similar to Cirque De Soleil but also different, I would suggest buying these tickets! They are definitely worth it!!
If I had never seen a Cirque show, I probably would have enjoyed Absinthe more.  The acts are the same... the man-on-man strength/acrobatics, the guy that balances on a bunch of chairs, death-defying trapeze and high-wire walkers... so the 3 stars are more for the ingenuity and pure outrageousness of Penny and the Gazillionaire.  The two of them had me laughing, especially with their gymnastics routine.  Sort of like you would imagine an even sleazier Borat doing acrobatics - very funny.. . The tight seating on folding chairs made the 90 minutes more uncomfortable than it should have been.  Tip - park in Caesar's valet if possible.  It's quite a trek to the tent otherwise.
Good christ this show was nothing short of amazing/terrifying/at times horrifying/un-be-lieve-able! I talked for an hour trying to recount everything about this show to someone who didn't see it before I realized it just isn't necessary to say anything more than "Go see it". . . P.S. If you are easily offended, this is not the show for you.
