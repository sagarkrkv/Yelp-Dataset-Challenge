My absolute favorite pizza in my life is served here!. It's Tartufata: prosciutto + mushroom. When it gets to my table, I have to bathe in aromatic truffle steam. Instant food orgasm
I love Cibo. I'm not fond of pizza and I don't like long Yelp reviews. But I've got to preface this with a ten-second backstory, so you'll understand why I was there in the first place. I'll make it fast: . . Amanda M is one of my favorite Yelpers here in Austin, and two weeks ago she sent me a totally random text: "I accidentally deleted all my pictures of a wonderful restaurant Andi & I went to in Phoenix, and I just want you to sympathize with me." Well okay then, I can do that. Amanda, I feel your loss. Been there, done that. Incidentally, Andi is Amanda's fiance and a cool guy. . . So here's how Karma works: Two weeks later I find myself in Phoenix, I have to eat somewhere, and I start thinking just because I'm a cool & sensitive guy, wouldn't it be fitting if I went to that restaurant and made a surprise photo montage for Amanda? Of course it would. That's what makes me a cool & sensitive guy. . . But what caught me by surprise is Cibo really is a remarkable place. It appears to be a converted house, and the outside patio/garden/dining area strewn with tiny lights is truly a wonderful place to be. On any given evening, it's easy to see why Cibo is a popular Phoenix destination. . . And it's also the best pizza I've ever had in a restaurant. I got a half Vegetariana and half Diavola, because Amanda said their spicy salami was really, really good. And she's correct. Perfect crust, perfect toppings. I'm pretty sure their cheese isn't coming from a can. The house salad and Nutella & strawberry crepe were just bonuses, and superb ones at that.. . I wish I could be a little more specific on what made Cibo - and everything about the place - a wonderful and memorable experience for me. The quality of ingredients? The magical ambiance? The precise yet transparent service? Maybe it's as simple as completing my mission - I knew what Amanda's montage would look like before I even pieced the pictures together. And I posted it for you here. . . You know that classic storybook rhetoric about the planets lining up correctly, and then everything falls into place in perfect harmony? Well, that's pretty much how I felt walking into Cibo, and that's exactly how I felt walking out. I'm not sure it gets much better than that. In proper Yelpspeak, that makes Cibo as good as it gets.
I've eaten at Cibo about a dozen times over the past 8 years. It's a beautiful restaurant, just tucked away from the Downtown/Roosevelt hustle & bustle - and the food is fantastic! The pizza here is crisp and delicious, and I really enjoy their sandwich creations! They use very high quality meat (and yes, I'm a mostly vegetarian!), and the ciabatta bread is to die for! . . This place is great if you are looking to spend all night drinking wine and eating great food with friends, if you are celebrating something special, or if you just want a tasty lunch! Parking is fairly straightforward here. And also, big kudos to the staff who have always been very friendly and attentive!
First of all, I love the ambiance. Perfect for date night and also perfect for my birthday dinner. . . Service and food wise, not so much. Our server was pretty rude. My boyfriend told her it was my birthday, and she said, "....ok. I'll bring something out at the end." She didn't not even look at me or say Happy Birthday. Okay whatever. We ordered the Palline 2.0, the fried dough with a side of Nutella, and a pizza that had potatoes and sausage on it. . . The fried dough: I expected it to be soft and fluffy...but it was a lot harder than I thought. It was hard to chew.. . Pizza: Meh...It was good? But it didn't really have a taste to it. I can taste the potatoes a little, but the cheese flavor was very mellow, and so was the sausage surprisingly. I did, however, taste the burnt crust very well. . . Free Nutella crepe: At least I got this for free for my birthday...but the crepe isn't as good as other ones I've tried.. . The entire time, our server didn't not ONCE look at me...WHY? My goodness...how upsetting. If I wasn't trying to have a nice birthday dinner, I would give it 1 or 2 stars.
This pizza place is incredible. It has a wonderful atmosphere, out of this world good pizzas, and delicious pasta. If you can ever get their squash pasta dish, DO. It gets crowded; arrive early or come late. Order wine--they have a great selection.
This is a beautiful spot. The food and staff are excellent. This is my first night in Phoenix, flying in from San Francisco and I have been spoiled.
I don't usually eat Italian, or pizza ... or give Italian or pizza places 5 stars. But this place really took me by surprise. . . WARNING: If you sit outside during mosquito season, prepare to be bitten!! Otherwise, it is probably one of the most ROMANTIC cute outdoor dining spots I've ever seen. Perfect for Phoenix since it's perpetually warm almost all the time during the summer, fall and spring months.. . We came here because of the phenomenal reviews, and also because everyone said it was better than Biano. . . I have to say, their daily pasta specials are amazing because the pasta is homemade! I am a sucker for homemade pasta even though I don't like Italian food for the most part ... sooo delicious. The food comes out extremely fast! . . The pizza here is the thin style wood-fired oven kind, which is great, and their overuse of truffle oil is totally ok with me. I loved the truffle mushroom pizza, and we got ricotta on the Diavlo. Recommended!
Two stars because the food was good. However when asked to sit on one side of the patio we were told they weren't sitting that side, even though people were sitting there. We decided to go inside for dessert and sit at the bar. Once inside the employees were taking up the bar with their bags and food. We tried to find a spot and the employees simply stared at us until we left the bar and found a table. A note for the owner; if your paying customers want to sit at the bar the employees should move their bags and food to the back.
I had the best gluten free pizza I ever had!!! and what fast service. no one else comes even close to taste.
Stopped by because of all the great reviews . We ordered two small lunch pizzas and a salad . The Diavola & Salsiccia. Our pizzas were very blan tasting and was soggy . Every slice I tried to pick up it would flop over and all the toppings would fall off  . Another thing I didn't really like was that the sodas are in cans and are way over priced 2$ . Why don't they have a soda fountain machine and serve it in a large glass ?
I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).. . First we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  . . When the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  . . The food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.
Perfect crust, delicious sauce and super fresh ingredients. Delectable crepes for dessert--you have to save room!!. The atmosphere is difficult to beat; it's essentially a little old house with a huge front patio, complete with several outdoor tables, strings of those medium sized "yellowish" lights. Inside is so adorable, with a few different rooms with tables in each one. It is always clean and can be a great place for a date or get together with family or friends. So worth it. I've never bothered to wait to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, so I can't say from personal experience but I suspect they wouldn't be any better than this little gem, CIBO. From friends who've been to both, I'd say they'd agree!
I came to this place with a friend, who raves about this place so I was excited to finally try it after all the hype that is was given on behalf of my friend. Sadly to say, I have had better pizza at a similar type restaurant to Cibo. The pizza that I had was soggy and had no flavor. I was very disappointed and do not believe that pizza should be eaten with a knife and fork. The only thing I liked was the dessert, which was the nutella crepe. I will never come pack here and stick to my favorite urban pizzaria, which is La Bocca in Tempe.
Believe it. The gluten free pizza you've dreamt of has arrived. I come here for lunch when it's slow and quiet. I've had almost all of their pizzas now but my favorite is the Di Norte by far. If you're celiac then you better make this a destination meal because you will never find better :)
I've been to Cibo a handful of times and each time I have left full, content and served well. It can be crowed if you are eating at peak times /days, but that just reiterates the tasty food and pleasant service! . . If you have not been, I hope you enjoy Cibo as much as my wife and I do.
Cibo is an unassuming little gem in a downtown Phoenix neighborhood. The ambience is perfect and the outdoor patio is gorgeous. Perfect place for a quiet, romantic meal. . We ordered several things to get a good taste, and everything was heavenly. From the perfectly cooked pizza with a mouth watering array of expertly balanced flavors, to the fresh salad, the otherworldly meatball sandwich, and finally to the sinfully fantastic crepes with Nutella and strawberries and whip cream. You can't go wrong, no matter what you order. . This place is quite the treat and the prices are quite reasonable for the unparalleled quality of the food you receive. . Forget about Pizzeria Bianco and make your way here instead. It's only a mile away from them, but the difference is night and day.
Lovely little spot downtown.  Very nice services and adorable building.  Love the outdoor patio   While I so appreciate the fact that they have Gluten Free Pizza (so hard to find) the crust is so salty that it's almost not edible.  I've tried it twice to make sure it wasn't a one time mistake.  I WILL go back again but will opt for a salad next time.
Yeah, another fiver, we had an amazing meal hear this weekend.  All the pizzas were great, I especially love the dough, it has so much flavor and perfect texture.  We were crepe crazy and ordered four of them, and they were so goooood! The orange marmalade one turned out to be my fav, I didn't expect that, but wow! It was so good! The marscapone and berry was a very close second.  I do have to mention for the sake of hoping it will help, not our waitress (she was AMAZING!) but the girl who brought the food to us, had a shitty attitude.  Thinkin a tune up is in order.
This restaurant is super cute! I loved the big outside patio and all of the tree lights. We ordered a pizza, a salad, and a sandwich. The pizza was ok, it was a little burnt in spots. The salad had a fresh taste but not a lot of flavor. The truffle fries that came with the sandwich were probably the best part of the meal. I would probably give this place one more shot.
Came here with a friend one night. The lights and the peaceful night would be great for a date. The sandwiches were great. My friend and I loved the fries!!! The pizza and the desert didn't really work for me. I will come back again with my gf another time. Sorry, I forgot the name of the food I ordered
Best place on Earth for pizza....period.
3.5 stars actually but I rounded up.. I've come to Cibo a few times for client lunches and I always order the pizza. The patio is beautiful and the food is good too... But I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in Phoenix.
This place is a must try out place.  The atmosphere is so laid back and the pizzas are absolutely delicious. The pizza taste so good.  Also the crepe's are so delicious, I had the fresca. It is full of fruits and vanilla ice cream.   I will definitely be back soon, very soon I reallt liked these place.  The staff was very nice and it felt very welcoming.
It pains me to write this review because I have loved this place for so long. Now myself and about 40 of my friends will never be back.  We had thrown a rehearsal dinner here and were all very excited but by the time we left we were disappointed, my friend wrote in with her feedback and instead, Michelle, blamed her!!  It was our fault it was hot, it was our fault the guests had to serve themselves, it was our fault dinner and dessert came out late. . . I get it things happen but how the company handled this is just ridiculous and inappropriate.  I am warning you, beware of this restaurant and it's lack of customer service. I am sure they will be receiving a few more reviews from our party as soon as they recover from the heat and all the work they had to do that night. Ps- one server for 40 people is NEVER enough.
Oven brick pizza here is delicious. Great romantic intimate atmosphere and on some nights they have live music outside. Love this place for dinner but not for lunch. I like this pizza better than the famous Bianco's pizza. Parking in the street is your only option and that is the only major complain I have about this place.
We have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when I found out they had a private room for me and my guests I was so excited! At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were goingto set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?. . My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!
I didn't have a big appetite and wasn't really into stopping at a restaurant that my girlfriend wanted to go to cause she went there a few years ago. I'm glad we stopped. The place is located at the end of a neighborhood. It was so odd going through residential (or maybe those businesses that look like little houses) streets and arriving at the restaurant. . . Cibo's a really cute place and it is probably super popular. The patio, at night, I can imagine is hopping and it is set up to accommodate a good amount of people (from what I remember, this was after driving 10 hours from Austin to Santa Fe and then another 8 from Santa Fe to Mesa). . . We went in the dead of the afternoon, way past lunch, and the staff was hanging out in one room and we were by ourselves in the other room. Cute place. Repetitive but it is legitimately an intriguing atmosphere because it teeters between cute and cool. I had some thin margarita pizza and I remember being a little disappointed in that the pizza itself was a little on the soggy doughy side. . . Girlfriend had... I don't remember what but she did order a huge chocolate crepe for dessert. That monster was super rich and sweet and I think at least 3 people can share it. If I wasn't staring at another 10 hour drive, I think it would have gone really well with a nice espresso. . . I would definitely recommend people to check out Cibo.
