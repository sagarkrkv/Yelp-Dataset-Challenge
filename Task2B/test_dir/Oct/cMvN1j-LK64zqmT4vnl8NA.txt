Best duck tounge in town, also service is great and fast , 5 stars!! Fyi, their tacos are small but worth it!
If you find your self in Vegas... This place is in the cosmopolitan and is definitely worth finding!
Good food hard to understand menu. The twenty vegetable rice very good. The oceans neat amazing.
Weird combo of Mexican and Chinese menu. Place is in the Cosmo, prices are decent. I had a Chicken Milanesa Torta (just so-so) and a Al Pastor Taco, which was good but not at all like a normal al pastor taco- was more like a piece of bacon with pineapple on top of it. Service was good. Overall, not bad but not a must-visit either.
Small portions, everything was salty, and expensive. Only reason I'm not giving one star was because the staff was very friendly and attentive. The price you pay for convenience staying in the Hotel to get chinese and Mexican food. I've had much better off the strip.
I was recommended by a local to try this place out. It was wonderful blend of Chinese and Mexican cuisines. We celebrated my dad's birthday. We ordered lamb potstickers from the dim sum menu, oh my this was incredible, the meat was cooked very well. Another Chinese dish we ordered was 18 Monk Noodles, very delicious! For the Mexican taste we had some poblano flautas, it had duck, this was a special on their menu. It was rich with flavor! Then we added papas fritas. Of course I ordered Mexican Coke. We ended the meal with tres leches! Oh my this was decadent, and huge! Haha didn't expect it to be so wholesome. The manager, Jessica was incredible and so was our server! Highly recommend this to anyone visiting and to the locals. I'm coming here again!
For being in the Cosmopolitan you would think the food quality would be at least good. I found it to be just meh & edible. Poor execution of a concept, taste, portions & pricing. Highly overpriced, even for Vegas standards. We had the duck flautas, 20 veggie fried rice ($20) , & dim sum sampler (6 tiny portions), total $60.00 + tax & tip. Left still hungry and unfulfilled.
Another amazing dining experience, thanks to Jose Andres.. . Customer Service is through the roof. Our waiter was cool and helpful. We had no clue what to order and he picked some amazing courses for us. . . We ordered steam buns, mango sticky rice, pork tacos, and sui mai from what I can remember. The steam buns were light and full of flavor, perfectly soft. The pork tacos had this amazing heat to them without being spicy. The mango sticky rice was an incredibly light and playful paler pleaser. . . I have nothing but great things to say about Chino Poblano. It's definitely made my list of "must stop" locations when visiting Vegas.
good meal, everything was good. We had swallow a cloud soup, when pigs fly, golden pigs, fried wonton, langosta tacos, tinga poplana. The Chinese was good, highlight was the fried wonton, nice crisp and thin wrapper !!! And love street style Mexican food.
Loved the eclectic food choices, especially the sticky buns. Service rocked and gave us champagne (on the house) for our 10 year anniversary.
I have to say, the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. . Helpful was good Because the menu confused us.. Is it tapas, is it an Asian Mexican fusion.... No. You can order Mexican food or Chinese food.. I was hoping for fusion. Seemed interesting and curious when i thought that.. Ended up a bit disappointed.  And overwhelmed.. I had something with the number 18 in it. Smelled awesome. Tasted pretty decent. We shared the When Pigs Fly and it was ok. . I wouldn't tell anyone that they HAVE to go there. . I feel badly bashing it, It just wasn't that great. . I feel like the prices were high for what it was, although it Is The Strip and that's what happens.. Again, friendly staff. Also a real cool atmosphere and clean bathrooms
We decided to check this place out of curiosity. The cuisine is suppose to be Chinese and Mexican fusion but it's actually just the type of food that they serve there. . . To drink I ordered the Michelada with a Corona Light. It was pretty tasty and just what I needed after a serious night of heavy drinking ha . . For my main dish, I ordered the Chilaquiles: eggs, tortilla chips, cheese, cilantro, onions and topped with green chile sauce. It was okay. I've had better.
First off, the service was superb!  Our waitress and busboys were moving like lightning with a packed restaurant.  We ordered the Day of the Dead tasting menu for a party of seven and had:. . -When Pigs Fly. -Siu Mai. -Taquitos. -Guacamole in small pasta cups. -Lamb pot stickers. -Fried wonton. -Dan Dan Mian. -Tuna ceviche. -Chicken Ji Song. -Col de asparagus. -Shrimp Mojo. -Dessert with coffee ice cream, bananas and chocolate. . It wasn't cheap at $65/person, but dang there was a lot of food.  The food was good, not great, sometimes a little bland.  That, and the fact that a tiny margarita costs $13, lost them the fifth star.  Once again, great service!
Try to make reservations beforehand, convenient that they text you when your table is ready and it's nice that it's right across the sports book.  Overpriced tacos, but they are pretty good.  To be full you have to order at least a couple, and I'm not sure if they would do the job of prepping your stomach for a night of drinking.  This place serves small portions, even their Traditional Sui Mai (6 pcs) looked really sad in its large container.  They were pretty small in size compared to what I'm used to at traditional Chinese restaurants.  I had a soup since I was a bit under the weather, the Caldo Tlalpeno which had shredded chicken, rice, peas, carrots, avocado and chipotle.  It was a bit bland, but it was perfect for how I was feeling.  I don't think I'd go back to China Poblano again, unless it was for that same soup, but it certainly wouldn't make me that full unless I ordered tons more stuff.  The dinner definitely warranted another dinner #2 an hour or two later.
Literally the worst restaurant my friends and I have ever had. Dim sum sucks. The Asian soups were totally bland and the tacos were only decent at best. If you crave Mexican food, might as well go to Taco Bell and save your $$$$$$$$$$. For all of its high prices, you would think it's good or at least edible, but it's not even worth trying. RUN!!!!!!!!!!!. . . Note: this review was only for the food since the service didn't even worth any star either. But it is also worth mentioning the service was slow, inattentive, and the restaurant wasn't even busy ona Wednesday night.
The food here was really good and fresh. We ate the Mongolian beef w/ lettuce and the 18 noodle. The food was very flavorful, the meat was tender, seasoning on spot, and noodles were fresh and cooked well.
After looking at other reviews I was skeptic of how this place would be, but gave it a try based on the menu. I'm glad I went despite others bad experiences because this was fantastic. We had the 18 noodle and the Mongolian Beef Lettuce, both incredible. If you're looking to get full it's going to cost you a lot, but if you're looking to try a few things tapas style it's fantastic. I highly recommend it.
Went there on the 24th for a special Ron Cooper Mescal Day of the Dead dinner.. Lots of compliments. First to the host staff for being incredible. Second to the head bar tender ( I forgot her name). Again very friendly and very knowledgable. The dinner was great. All of the tasting items were fabulous. Will have to go back to work the menu, but the 9 course tasting menu was very good. Not OMG, but I did reach a point of having booze goggles on as every course has more mescal. Huge fan of Jaleo, so this wasn't a suprise.
I know I shouldn't have expected an authentic Chinese/Mexican restaurant, but I can't help it.  We were hungry, my grandma wanted to be at the Cosmo and we thought this place looked cool.  While it looks cool and the staff is very friendly, I was very disappointed with the food and the prices. My boyfriend bought...well, I can't remember the Spanish name for it, but he said it translates (literally) to Spoiled Cheese.  It was my first time trying it, but he said that it was mediocre for how much he was being charged ($10 for a small thing of cheese and a few tortillas on the side, WHAT).  I got the Papas Fritos, which was actually filling because it was really just a bunch of fries in mole and queso fresco.  It was ok, I expected there to be more cheese and the fries to be crispier. Also, again it was a small amount of fries and it was worth $7.  'Scuse me, but I could go to Robertos and get a huge ass box of Carne Asada Fries for that same price.  I would get five times as much as you gave me. My grandma got the pork buns (Siopao) and man.  That really disappointed me.  After being an avid Chinatown visitor of both LA and Las Vegas, and being of Filipino descent, I was appalled that these four, dainty buns were $12.  If you're going to charge that much, these buns better be damn good.  Nope.  I ate it all though because I didn't want to waste food that was expensive. it ended up being over $40 for just three plates.  Mind you, we didn't even order other beverages.  Oh, and they charge $4 for the chips and salsa. SERIOUSLY?! Sadly, the chips and salsa were the only good dish too.  . . I would rather go to Panda Express for "Chinese" or Taco Bell for "Mexican", that way we would've saved our money.
