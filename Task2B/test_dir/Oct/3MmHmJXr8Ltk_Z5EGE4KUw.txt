Very disappointing. Had a New York steak Italian Batali style I guess.   Came with a sauteed medley of vegetable on top of the steak.  Quit not steak like in my opinion..... . . For price paid, should have went elsewhere in Hotel restaurant instead.. . Served lard instead of butter with accompaniment of bread assortments. Kinda different bit I prefer butter all the way. :)
I went here at the suggestion of my brother and after reading a few write-ups on Yelp.. . Service:  The service was excellent.  We had a great waiter who was prompt, thorough and thoughtful.. . Food:  We started with the truffle pasta ($50).  My wife liked it better than me, but I just thought it was ok.  I have had this at other places where it is mouth-watering, but this seemed a little dry.  Perhaps they should have also used truffle oil/butter instead of just shaving truffles on top of the dry pasta.. . We shared the bone-in ribeye for two- $140.  While they were caving it at the table I noticed that it seemed very fatty - more fatty than most rib eyes.  It was tasted ok, but certainly not worth the money.  It was very rich and decedent.  When we were done there were several large chunks of fat still on our plate.  Normally, I like a well marbleized steak, but this took it to the extreme...plus the cost was too high given what was uneatable.  . . Abiance - its not the most secluded place in Vegas seeing as it is stick in the middle of a mall.  Our table had some privacy but you could definitely hear the mall traffic.. . Vegas is filled with great steak places and I am not sure that I would go out of my way to revisit Carnevino....especially given the price point.
I'm shocked at the not so good reviews.  My experience was top notch.  I rank Carnevino right up there with Del Frisco and Cut.  Pricey but food was awesome.  A buddy and I were throwing craps for a weekend at Palazzo.  We decided to grab one good meal to go with our otherwise pedestrian burger and pizza diet.  We got the ribeye for 2.  I know, how romantic.  Any how, it's just one of the best steaks I've ever had.  It's cooked a little more rare than normal.  We ordered mediumrare and I thought it was closer to rare.  But the waiter did tell us it would be that way and it was still delicious.  Adding to the beefy flavor was a drizzle of oil on top.  For sides wild mushroom and the mashed potatoes with guanciale and egg mixed in.  If you are willing to spend for a great meal, I highly recommend it.. . P.S.  Everyone was very well dressed but my buddy and I were in ball caps and t shirts and it was no problem.
I'm well aware my friends and I chose to come to an expensive place, but this was ridiculous. The food was not mind-blowing but the prices were. Kids meal size pasta dishes for $20 or more. They poured my group water like they would at any other restaurant, but then charged us $50 for that water! It wasn't even like water from the moon or something fancy like that, it was the same type of water that comes out of your sink when you turn it on. What kind of honest place does that? I felt cheated, which I was not expecting from a "nice" place like this. There is a Tacos el Gordo on the strip now, if you are looking to satisfy your inner carnivore then please go there.
The services was terrible, we could not understand our server they gave us a new server and neglected us the whole night. Mark Neff 702-321-4020 also spoke to the assistant manager she was going to have the general manager called me and its been 4 days no call back. Had friends that run restaurants on the strip go in there and the service was terrible with them as well.
We went there for dinner last night with a friend visiting. It was a very delicious meal. Highly recommend. . . Our friend ordered a rib eye with a steak sauce,  mashed potato side with a poached egg on top; My husband and I shared a new York steak, dry aged beef tortellini and short rib ravioli. Our friend enjoyed the rib eye a lot. We also like the new York steak very much. We like that it is very tasty, soft, flavorful, and the beef is hormone free and antibiotic free!!! Awesome! The ravioli tasted very great as well. The pasta wasade in house. We were told that the bucatini and spaghetti were dry pasta, others are made in house, that's why we went for ravioli and tortellini. The tortellini tasted great as well but it was very small like an appetizer. . . At the end, we ended our meal with dessert. We had tiramisu and the gelato (strawberry, pistachio and chocolate). Again they were awesome. I like the tiramisu tasting very fresh and the ingredients were of good quality. It is way better than regular ones from american restaurants. The gelato were made in house as well (they said all desserts are made in house daily and fresh). The gelato is priced $12 and it is comprised of 3 scoops with your selected flavor. We like that the gelato is soft, smooth and tasted clean with real ingredients, no artificial flavor, coloring or thickening agent. It is really awesome.. . The food is really pricey, it is okay for once in a while, and the food tasted really good. It was a great experience!
