Came back for another fix 3 days later before leaving Vegas and chef Ricardo was still cooking up a storm. We came around 11am on a Monday and waited about 30 min.. . Had to get the Combo Pan Roast again- this time with a 6 on the spicy scale and for me it was the perfect kick without being uncomfortable. Just as good as the first time- amazing!. . We also tried the Alaskan Claim Chowder and it is one loaded chowder! Plenty of clams, shrimp, lobster mixed in with the creamy, comforting, flavorful soup. This actually goes really well with the pan roast because it is a milky type of creaminess, while the pan roast has more of a tomatoey flavor. . . Can't wait for the next time!
Yeah... What they are saying for the line is true. We went there on a Sunday night around 7pm and still stood an hour in line. But the food is absolutely delicious. Pan roast is great, so as the Alaskan clam chowder soup.
I LOVE THE OYSTER BAR! I don't mind the line -- it's expected with only having 15 seats & all the praise for the food being so dead on. It's definitely worth the wait. The staff at any shift -day, swing or graveyard- are consistent with each other -- all so personable and giving fast service. I love that we could watch the chef make the food right in front of you and/or socialize with the neighboring couples/groups, making the atmosphere so casual. I especially recommend the pan roast. While people I've taken with me here have preferred the Combo pan roast (shrimp, lobster and crab) or the palace pan roast (sausage, lobster, shrimp,  crab and chicken) , I feel like all the meats, etc. are too much so I settle for the crab pan roast! Make sure to come HUNGRY!
We had the best Combo Pan Roast here!  Our cook was Bob and our waitress was Margie. The only regret was being as they only had 6 steam pots, 18 seats which in turn we waited 45 minutes for our order. But, well worth the wait. Delicious!  Thankfully,  Bob's and Margie were entertaining. We got there just in time, because as soon as we got there, a long line formed!  My friend had the Ceasar Shrimp salad, it only had 3 shrimp. However, the shrimp were huge!  We will definitely be back!
waited an hour and a half, and that's considered a shorter line. well worth the wait, though (limited seating area is why the line is normally long). be nice to the chef(s) & server(s), because your experience will only benefit from it (and it's not like they don't deserve it; most of them are really good at what they do, while being more than personable).
Will never leave Vegas again without getting some gumbo.   This place serves real gumbo, okra and all.  Had the clam chowder also, it was okay have had better, but the gumbo is worth 10 stars.  Don't let the wait or the  waitress quickly tossing your bread plate on the counter distract you from this food experience.   Once seated, they let you enjoy your food.  No rush to get up for the next patrons.  I liked that.  Went around 12 pm Friday afternoon, about an hour wait.
The first time I came here it was around 8pm and had to wait about 1.5 hrs in line, then another 30min for the food. The 2nd time around, we got there right at 12pm right before the rush came, so it was nice to not have to wait this time. . . The combo pan roast and the alaskan chowder is just amazing. Every bite you take has mounds of seafood. The flavor is consistent within the chefs and honestly, the price is worth how much seafood portions you get. The oysters are actually not too bad as well.
the food was good, but the wait is not. and i noticed the reason it took so long was because service really is very slow. there was only on waitress behind the bar for everyone, and the time to get our food, receive the check, and run the check took FOREVER.
This place is one of my favorite go to spots for dinner. It's 24 hours so I try to go after dinner hours (9pm or later) so there's a minimum wait in line.. . The combo pan roast and cioppino are two of my favorites. Definitely the way to go. Can't wait to eat there again soon.
First of all, OMG. I can't believe I've never heard of this place. On my last day in Vegas with the birthday girl, Krizia, she suggested we try this place out. Once I heard oyster I was all for it. I didn't think it would be anything crazy though. We waited in line for maybe 30 minutes on a Sunday. After going over the menu, I still didn't know what I was getting myself into. Sitting at the bar was a lot of fun, the chef and our server were very friendly and funny. I ordered the jumbalaya and my friend ordered the panroast combo so that we can share the two dishes. We also ordered oysters which were also really yummy and were cracked and brought to use very fast. Nothing compares to that feeling you get when your food comes out and it's all prepared and cooked in front of you so it is almost like a little tease. I wish I was a better writer so that I could properly described how amazing the panroast was. It's this creamy, buttery sauce with crab, lobster, shrimp, and a scoop of rice. I might've forgotten to include something, but my goodness I can't stop thinking about it! In others' reviews I've read, they compare it to The Boiler in Chino Hills which I also heard is the same owner of this place. I am so happy that I can satisfy my endless craving closer to home. I miss you Oyster Bar. See you soon
The Pan Roast lobster, crab and shrimp is worth all the hype its like crack wish I could click my heels and be there from Cali back to Vegas just to get me a bowl of yumminess.  We went in around 4am so luckily there was no wait.  But please be patience its cooked right in front of you so it takes at least 30 minutes but its so worth it.  We got the happy hour oysters they were ok but nothing to rave about.  Also the hot bread is so good dipped in your pan roast but they seem to be skimpy about giving us seconds.  Make sure you tip them good theres a lot of love that goes into their pan roasts!!
I can't believe I almost didn't try this place. . . We had gone to Bacchanal the night before and I had more than gotten my oyster fix. . We were in town to watch the Kings battle the Avalanche at MGM and the game ended up going into a shootout. Needless to say, we were pretty hungry at that point, but didn't want to eat anything we would regret the next morning. I perused my bookmarks and the boyfriend thought Oyster Bar was the most benign choice. . . First off, this place is literally a bar. The maximum occupancy is probably right at 12 people. The menu is concise, which helps with the efficiency of the turnover rate. We were the third party in line and waited approximately 45 minutes. Let me tell you that the wait is worthwhile. I've waited over 2 hours to get ciopino in San Francisco, so this was a cake walk. . . The bar is really unique. The 2 chefs prepare everything in front of you. There are maybe 6 cooking stations- big metal pots where they cook the dishes to order. And you get to enjoy yummy smells from all the pots. . . The boyfriend started off with a half dozen rawoysters, which were shucked by our server. They were huge and fresh, according to him. We decided to split a ciopino. Split charges are $5. The serving size was decent. I could have easily polished it off on my own, but it was late and I didn't want to overstuff myself. We had an option for rice or pasta? which we thought was a little strange. We politely declined both (we also didn't see the $5 split charge. It may be because we skipped the starch side) Once the ciopino came out, we understood why pasta was an option. The soup portion was hearty, much like a pasta sauce. It was rich and flavorful and the seafood was cooked to absolute perfection. . . I will definitely be back. I'd love to try the raw sampler platter and one of the stews. Those are made with a tomato and cream base and smelled amazing when the chef was cooking it in front of us.
The service is friendly and nice and the Pan Roast is worth the wait. Although there are times when the wait can be up to two hours, you'll be so happy that you waited! It's a must stop every time my husband and I visit Las Vegas. . . If you like to eat oysters and or clams try them on the half shell!!!
I would have to say one of the best oyster bars of all times. Have gotten better quality seafood here than in the south and nw. Always fun to watch them cook your combo pan roast in front of you.
Run!Don't walk and definitely stand in line till you get a seat. This bar will not disappoint. What an experience to watch your creole food being prepared and other patrons dishes being served next to you. The blend of different aromas makes you anticipate the arrival of your own dish even more. . . I ordered the shrimp gumbo with a heat level of 5 stars. Amazing! It was loaded with shrimp and every bite was a symphony of flavors.  Get off the strip and head to Palace Station. You will be glad you did.
BEST PAN ROAST EVER. I usual get the house pan roast. The bf usually gets the crab pan roast. They put a lottttttt of crab in there! It's very very very delicious. It's pretty difficult to find pan roast anywhere else. Fortunately for me, I can go to OC and get Ritter's Steam Kettle! Still, Oyster bar is my all time favorite! . . The last time I came here I got the cherry clams. Sooooooo good. I think it might even be better than the oysters. But don't get me wrong the oysters are fresh as hell and delicious too! Also during my last visit I found a weird object in my pan roast, they figured out that it was starch from the soup base that didn't get incorporated all the way. It was kinda gross lol but good thing this place has awesome customer service! They took it off the bill, as they should. I've been to place where they mess up and don't comp. the dish. -.- our water glasses were least full. No complaints here. YES, the wait can suck, but the food is so worth it!! . . TL; DR-best seafood in Vegas! Long wait, but well worth it! (:
Pan roasts, gumbo, and oysters, oh my! Lots to choose from at the Oyster Bar! We ate the Combo pan roast and the Alaskan chowder. Great flavor in both, loaded with seafood. We could not finish these dishes as they were too big! One star off for the wait- one and a half hours we waited. This little bar is getting all the attention and the steak house restaurant next door was empty. Maybe they need to move the oyster bar into that!
It's such a honor to yelp right after my yelp elite friend @Bridget P! =D. . My friend was RAVING, hands down R-A-V-I-N-G about this place so we just HAD to eat here while we were in town. Let's just say the expectations were sky-high at this moment. . . Right after we parked, we briskly strolled over to the bar joint. There were about 8-9 people in front of us and equated to 45 mins of waiting time from when we were seated. And consider this waiting time being lucky folks. . . If southern gumbo seafood cuisine excited on the west coast, Oyster Bar has the recipe down pat, I pinky promise!! . . Pros:. +stomach was happy and generous portion, had enough for leftover. +excellent staff and waiters (waitresses) and chefs. +was social and met some locals by striking up conversations in line waiting. +the hype was real and exceeded my expectations. +extended hours to 24 hours. . Cons:. -extreme wait...ing...in ...line.... -limited seating . -the smoke and alcohol can make you dizzy (Yes, located inside a casino!). . I was recommended the combo pan roast as a newbie and didn't disappoint!! 2 thumbs up! Watch out, Oyster Bar, I will be singing your high praises until my dying breath!! ^.^ Also, how could I forget to add the fresh dozen oysters!!! I saw them peel over the oyster shelf in front of my own eyes! AHHH...dreaming about it again now...
open 24/7... come here on the off hours... so you don't wait in a que.. I come here after work in the wee early mornings and there's no line.. On my last visit last week... I had to wait almost an hr for my pan roast! How crazy is that?!  It wasn't bus either... I'm not to sure what the deal was... but I was hungry and tired... not a good time to wait that long for food! That's my reason for the minus one star... always kinda pricey... but you're eating seafood!. Otherwise... this is a hidden gem inside of the PS. . PAN ROAST... I LOVE YOU!!! mmm... comfort food at its best!
Love this place! Never disappointed. Great food and service. Wish they expanded their seating, so I wouldn't have to stand in line and watch others eat. But then again the food is worth the wait. Can't wait to visit them again.
I absolutely LOVE this place. I dont really care that I have to wait an hour, because the food is so delicious. Whenever I go, there's this Asian man with glasses who is cooking - he is seriously so funny, makes fun of you, and makes it really enjoyable to be sitting/waiting for food. The oysters are always so fat and juicy and I always have to get a dozen. I also always get the combination pan roast. The portions are huge, so you should either share a plate or take it to go - I suggest you take it to go so you can indulge yourself later. Make sure to come with an empty stomach! You will not be disappointed.
I had heard a lot about the oyster bar. It's legendary for long lines and people who are willing to wait 2 hours to get a seat. I got there around 5:45pm and got seated around 6:45pm. Even tho the line was not long. Usually one person waits and that person waiting may have 6 or more in the party. . . Now let's get to the food. I got the pan roast which is what they're famous for. They ask you what spicy level form 1-10 . I chose 3 and it was perfect for me a tinge of spicy hot. Next time I'm gonna try level 4. the guy told me the spicy level all depends on the chef on duty, when I went he told me the chef is right on the money. The pan roast had crab, shrimp and lobster. honestly the flavor remind me of chicken tiki Marsala almost except with sea food. It was very good and worth the wait. Next time I'll try something else. My friend also got half dozen oysters, he said it was good and regretted not getting a dozen. Everything is cooked right in front of you. As soon as you sit down they give you a warm dinner roll with bread. The service was excellent and . refilled your drinks without even asking. Definitely a place I would recommend when in Vegas.. . The long wait does suck and why a place that is busy 24/7 doesn't expand doesn't make sense.
This place is legit! I been to Vegas so many times but this is the first time I heard of this place. I got the combo plan roast and is delicious. Portions are huge and is super fresh
Gumbo is awesome!  You can get spicy level from 1-10 and if u like spicy, I highly recommend 8 stars. Oysters are super juicy and fresh!!
Everyone raves about this place...and yes it's true. Waited a little over an hour on a Thursday night around 11PM, friends say I'm lucky to have barely waited haha! Tried the gumbo and it was pretty good, not great. But.....the Pan Roast....yup, twas HEAVEN! I personally think the sauce is a mix between lobster bisque, tomato cream soup and creamy pontchartrain sauce. Very heavy but oh so good. Big portions so share or come with an empty stomach. The oysters were super fresh...like...I taste the ocean...in my mouth...type of way. =) . . 5 Stars for the Pan Roast because I can't seem to find an adequate recipe for it online. Think its a top secret recipe. shrugs. Not to sure if I want to pay random strangers online for the recipe....but I'm tempted. haha
Palace pan roast combo all day!!
Allan, E.Z., and Steve are all awesome at their job as the food was delicious and the service was great. They made it feel homey as if we were eating at a good friends dinner table.
Lines don't look long but don't let that fool you. Only a few people like 3 groups in front and still had to wait an hour and a half. Ordered pot roast seafood and oysters. Very fresh and will come again. Also here's a tip order extra rice if you are ordering pot roast you can share for two. It's huge
Pan roast is amazing but NOT worth the 2 hour wait. Skip on the gumbo. You will be disappointed. There are only 18 seats at the bar.
Definitely can't go wrong with a visit to the oyster bar! I would have to agree that the oysters are nothing to run home and tell about but they are decent! You would think that they would have above par oysters being that the restaurant name is themed around that particular item! The infamous pan roast happened to be one of the items I ordered and it was exactly what I anticipated  it to be! VERY GOOD! Filling and rather tasteful :-) I got a medium but i think I'll do more spicy the next time! Clam chowder is a hit! I wish it would've been hotter though! The location inside the Texas is much less busy!
I went here for lunch and there was hardly a line. My friend and I ordered the oyster on the shell, a bowl of the New England clam chowder and the combo pan roast with a level three on spiciness. First off they will ask if you are sharing plates and you gotta be honest. They ask so they can charge you an extra five dollars but the plates were so big it actually saves you money to share rather than order another entree . The clam chowder was amazing and not salty. The oyster fresh and didn't have that fishy aftertaste. The pan roast was amazing and just the right amount of spice. Definitely coming back when I am in town!!!
Oh man, I love this place! Oyster bar is located in palace station hotel. Go at really odd times as there could potentially be a 2-3 hour wait. They only have 16 seats so I definitely recommend going after clubbing or super duper early in the morning.. . The pan roast was soooo amazing. Very creamy and filling. This order plus 2 scoops of rice can definitely serve 2 people. This is a must order!. . I would recommend skipping on the oysters. While they were good, I would save room for the pan roast and the shrimp and lobster fra Diablo.
I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to Vegas and tonight was the perfect night! . . I had the oysters and linguini white clam sauce. Oh my god-both were unreal!!!. . I guess I've never had a real oyster or clam because this was just ridiculous! . . I went on a Tuesday and the wait wasn't bad at all! Order the white clam sauce! Sooooooooo good and so full!
$@,!:$,8/&2?;&;' goddamn the wait is long! But man it was worth the wait. Here is my review:. . Interior: this place is inside palace station, one of the old casinos off the strip. When I saw the casino from the outside, I thought this place is gonna be shady, but unlike the casino, the bar looks nice and neat!. . Customer service: my girl and I got there around 915 and got seated after an hour. We had to wait another 45 mins to get our food. They could seriously expand or give people a piece of bread while waiting. I went there hungry and almost died before eating. Another thing that bothered me is the staff. The chef was kinda cold when the ladies next to us were joking and waitress wasn't any better. She was jus spotty. . . At this point, you might wonder why I give this place five stars.. The game changer... . Food: the combo pan roast was jus redunk. I never had anything similar before. The soup was creamy and rich. The lobster, crab, and shrimp were harmoniously dancing around in the soup while I was indulging myself. . . I was desperate, hungry and miserable while waiting but all is forgiven. I salute you, oyster bar. I'll never forget you!
The wait here is ridonkulous, but that's to be expected: they only have 15ish seats so you pretty much watch people eat while you wait miserably in line.  Came here on a MONDAY night at 9pm thinking... the wait can't be that bad. Wrong! Despite this, many people will wait and for good reason: the food is pretty darn GOOOOD.. . We were seated after about an hour and it took another hour to finally get our food. They make everything to order and make it right in front of you, so I guess that's pretty cool.. . I got the combo pan roast and an order of 6 oysters. Oysters were surprisingly good for being in the desert! Mmmm.... wish I could have some right now.. . Combo pan roast had shrimp, lobster and crab. So glad I got the combo with shrimp bc the whole pan roast is really creamy, and just having lobster or crab would have been too mushy! The seafood tastes so fresh. I would say this meal is really heavy though..next time I may just share with someone and enjoy something else on the side. . . I got spicy level 5 to be safe but I wish I got 7 or 8. 5 wasn't really spicy at all to me. It did not have the slightest kick. I guess it's my fault for not getting it spicier.. . The service was okay. The chef made no effort to conceal his tiredness and apparent annoyance with his job. I also feel like they're so understaffed. When people are done eating and leave, it can take them a while to clean up and seat the next starving party.. . You should definitely check this place out if you haven't :)
Okay wow. This place is fantastic. There's only like 12 seats in the whole restaurant and there is ALWAYS a wait! But seriously the wait is worth it. I waited about 35 minutes (which I hear isn't that bad).. . I had the oysters which were the best I've ever had! Even better than Jersey Shore oysters. . . I ordered the palace pan roast. It was amazing! The crab was so good. The andouille sausage was delicious. . . The portion was huge!!! And it was only $23 for all of that seafood. . . I would absolutely recommend getting that dish. . . Can't wait to go back!
I come here at least twice a month and I pray Hollowmon is there every time he's extremely into every dish he cooks and very entertaining.
If I don't stop by Oyster Bar when I'm in vegas, I leave a little broken hearted.  This is the only "bar" I go to because I'm hungover... LOL. I have given over 2 hours of my precious life just to get a seat here... So ya know my love for Oyster Bar is unconditional. . . The pan roast is so good that it's popped up in my hometown in Orange County.. Although he is former chef to Oyster Bar, it's just not as good.. . Same people always working every time I visit. The chefs are really nice and easy to talk to... Even at 4 IN THE MORNING! I give props for dealing with all the pan roast fiends at ALL wee hours of the night for years on end! . . The oysters at "oyster bar" aren't the freshest though. The clam chowder is good. The steamed clams are good. The bouillabaisse is good. BUT PAN ROAST IS THE BEST!!! I personally get rice on the side & lvl 8/9 spicy but I love my food more caliente!. . DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SHARING... because leftovers are just as good later when you're drunk.
