We had always wanted to stay here, but I am very disappointed.  The room was very small, and I know your just there to sleep but I was just very unimpressed with the room.  Think I will stick to down town
Very poor emergency medical service this evening (11:50pm) when a young man with his head face down on a table and barely responsive. Security personnel with obviously NO MEDICAL training atempted to help and were extremely defensive with myself and my so. Both Firefights/EMTs trying to assist. We were both told to back off and " We have it handled, we deal with this every day" they obviously did not know what they were doing, and failed to call for professional emergency medical care. This type of ignorance is unacceptable in this day and age and is extremely costly (liability) to any business. Wake up.
1. Front Desk Customer Service was awful and rude.. . 2. I upgraded to a players suite and customer service agent said room was going to be ready in one hour.  It took them 3 hours, Manager on duty waived room upgrade awesome right!!! NOT!!! room was filthy looked like barf was on the bathroom door bathroom shower was clogged with hair jacuzzi tube was filthy with hair and little tiny pieces of rubbish.  floor towel was brown and looked like DODO stains on it nasty.  Advised the front desk manager advised quote (Well we waived your upgrade) I was like Oh thanks but that does not mean you give me a dirty room I advised if thats the case I would have paid full price for a clean one thank you very much!!! they did nothing for me I was very disappointed because it was my birthday and  wanted it to be a awesome one but I would not stay here never ever again I would rather stay in my rental car it was cleaner.     . . 3. Check in at 2:37pm got to room at 4:55pm room was not ready which we were late for our show and dinner needed to switch reservations so if you have plans to do things don't stay here.. . 4. I would stay at down town at the Plaza hotel its cleaner there.
It's between 2-3 stars for me. The room was nice. Big bed that was comfy and a spacious room. A LOT of closet space. Friendly staff. Any whooo...the things I didn't like was a)The maid did not do a good job at cleaning it beforehand. Used tissues on the bathroom floor in a corner. Dried soap scum on the shower wall. It was a nice room but it was a little hard to enjoy when I'm imagining what gross icky stuff was lurking an all of the surfaces. So I was thinking the whole time...are these sheets clean? Was this bathroom cleaned/mopped/sanitized/wiped down at all? And how often? There were no other rooms available so we were stuck with it : / Unless we wanted to pay an upgrade fee to get another room. b) sometimes (random times in the day) there would be a burning plastic smell : / unpleasant c) the roller coasters starts at 8 AM. So anyone wanting to ride it at 8 AM is free to do so. Vacation is about sleeping in. Come onnnn! :P
Stayed here recently for two nights with a group of ladies to celebrate a birthday. We were 6 people, and we booked two double rooms. Everyone was flying in from different places, and I was the lucky one who experienced a major flight delay, so everyone checked in hours before I arrived.. . I took a shuttle from the airport, and went to check in and get a room key on my own so I could stash my stuff. You have to walk through the casino in order to get to the front desk, which I didn't love (it's pretty smokey and I have allergies/asthma). The check-in process was really easy- my friend had left my name, so they checked my ID and asked how many keys I wanted. At 1:30 in the morning on a Friday, there was about a 10 minute wait to speak to someone. But, the man working the front desk was really nice and complemented my wallet.. . The room was a decent size, and I found the beds to be really comfortable. Our bathroom was large, but the toilet made weird noises for about 5 minutes after it was flushed (it wasn't running or flushing itself, it just sounded...weird. We all noticed and commented on it, but it wasn't enough to call the front desk or complain about. I found the room to be clean.. . We didn't actually eat at any of the places in the hotel, and I didn't gamble in the casino, so I can only speak to the hotel portion, but I found it to be a fine place to sleep for a reasonable price, and the location was nice to be able to explore the strip over the course of a few days.
A fair hotel, a decent price.. . As far as hotels in Vegas go, it's not the most beautiful. But if you want to stay off the strip and not spend an arm and a leg to do it, New York New York is a good way to go.. . The rooms were large and quite fairly clean. They had all the amenities you could possibly require. My only complaint about our room was the serious lack of a view. We large windows on the corner of the building...and only really had a view of a portion of the roof and the roller coaster. Not the end of the world, but...mundane. . . Because of the price it seems this hotel attracts a moderately sloppy crowd. There will be no shortage of overweight white people in flamboyantly colored track suits playing the slots. . . I liked that the interior lobby was designed to look like you were in the middle of downtown new york, however, the architect would have been better served designing some window seating or something. We didn't eat here, but I'm pretty sure it's not possible to have a nice meal when you're directly across from someone loudly yanking at the slots.. . Overall this was a decent hotel. If you're in town to take in the get some good food and see some shows, you'd be better off staying at the Bellagio or The Aria. If you're bringing you're 3 kids and you don't mind walking a bit to get everywhere interesting, New York New York would be perfect for you.
First time in Vegas. . New York New York is the only hotel I've been in this far and it's pretty awesome. There's little cities in here! This place is huge. Went to Coyote Ugly, (which is in this hotel) that super fun. . There are plenty of food options and majority are open very late (woo!). The rooms are nice. We got a suite and the bathtub is soooo nice. Great way to treat your feet at the end of the night.
I read a number of reviews and was a little concerned about my booking.  I normally stay at the ARIA and am certainly use to what I get there.  I was attending Vegas on a conference and use some of my comps to stay at the New York New York.  The rate I had will not add value to your decision on booking.  Here is what might help.  Check In was quick even though I could not find the VIP desk.  I was in a room on the 17th floor of the New York tower.  The room was in great shape and very clean.  It had everything I expected from a Vegas MGM resorts room.  I had asked the front desk to get me away from the noise and that is how I ended up on the 17th floor.  That said the noise from the coaster is very annoying.  I think maybe the 34th floor if it exists might have helped.  Since the coaster runs around the hotel I am not sure you can escape it.  If you are not looking to get to sleep earlier don't worry about it....it seems to end around midnight.   The only issue that I have and cant seem to get a reply on is the rate I was charged.  I was asked if I wanted to be billed in CDN funds and I said yes.  I think I have been charged over 30% when my card would have charged about 12%.  I have tried to call the number provided and was on hold for way to long....so I tried to use the email that they provided and I have not heard back.  I will refuse to be charged a criminal exchange rate.....if I can confirm that is what they have done....so far I can only trust what little information I have been provided when I used the online checkout....if they ever answer me I suspect I can get it resolved.  The hotel experience was just fine and I would be cautious of believing all the negative that I read.
got free 2 night offer from here . love that it's convenient located on the strip. the room were nice and we also got 20 $ in free play. the only negative is , that they charge you a 20 $ per day resort fee , even though you got the rooms for free.
Finally getting to put in a review but of all the properties I've stayed in Vegas, NYNY is by far the most convenient and fun =). . . Through MyVegas, thy lover and I got 2 nights comped in their Park Ave room. Would've love to stay longer but life called for us to go back home. Either way the two nights there has definitely convinced us to return.. . What I love about this hotel is that the staff is SUPER DUPER friendly and courteous! Being the tourist that I was, I went to check in at the WRONG LINE, which I believe was for VIP type guests but guess what, they still helped me out. After checking in, I saw a long ass line with a bunch of people waiting about 50 feet away. Oops but your bad =P. . ***BTW, we got a nice corner room facing errrthang bc I mentioned to the desk guy it was me and thy lover's first time in Vegas together (true story so we did not have to pay the rip off $50 upcharge for a corner and strip view)***. . As opposed to the other hotels I've stayed at, this location has more of a "we want you to enjoy your stay with us" vibe. It's smaller than a lot of other places so I felt it was more of a REAL stay for vacation rather than there to party, gamble and go home type feel.. . Anyways quick pros & cons:. Pros:. - Friendly staff. - Family friendly especially if you got kids (they have an awesome arcade). - Easy to access a bunch of places on the strip. - Nice clean room. - Parking garage isn't a b***h to get to unlike other places if you need/forget something in your car. Con:. - Limited selection of quick food joints (mainly dine in). . Ooooo another story, I pretty much lost a few hundos gambling at other casinos but my LAST $20 make it all up on this cool slot machine in NYNY. You the bomb!
Love the food area, looks like a miniature New York. Lots of good shops. Has a bridge to the MGM Grand. The magic shop is worth a look.
I had booked and paid for this trip months ago, so I honestly cannot remember what our stay cost.  My wife and I were involved in the planning of a large charity event and had planned this trip as both a reward and something to look forward to as we did the grueling work on the event.  . . On average, we go to Vegas 2 to 4 times a year.  Due to our work schedules we tend to go on Sundays- Thursdays.  This was our first time checking in on a Friday so when I saw the line at the front desk, my enjoyment of our trip was already in jeopardy.  The front desk had all windows open though and the line moved fairly quickly.  . . Check-in itself thought was surprisingly quick and efficient.  I was surprised that there was no talk of a room deposit.  This is the first time that I have booked a trip like this with American Express so I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we were checked in MUCH quicker that those around us.. . Unlike many places in Vegas, the elevators were located near the front desk so we did not have to walk all of the way through the casino.  Bag service was prompt, especially for a Friday during prime check-in time.. . Our jacuzzi room was clean and spacious.  Everything functioned well except for the television which pixelated on most of the stations making watching tv nearly impossible.  This is an issue only because I tend to wake up well before my wife and am looking for something to do.  . . Valet service was prompt enough with no excessive waiting. . . We checked out via in-room television which went seamlessly.  . . All in all, I would stay at NY NY again and would recommend it to others.
Nice and friendly atmosphere great for people with children. The roller coaster was super fun and the cuisine was amazing. My room was clean and and comfortable.
