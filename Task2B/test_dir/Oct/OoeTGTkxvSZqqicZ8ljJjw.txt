First time going to this place to watch Tiesto and I was not disappointed! The venue was overly packed but we were able to push our way to the front and had an amazing time! The security guard (some guy in dreads) in the front was so cool he kept the crowd controlled but wasn't a party pooper and was dancing along and taking pictures with the crowd.
I'm not one to right reviews unless the service is phenomenal or horrible.  So as you can see, it's horrible and not worth your time or money.  Only good thing, was we pre-purchased the expensive tickets, and got in fast.  But as many have said in prior reviews - extremely pricey, and even more $$$$ for a VIP table.  Being to many EDM clubs, raves, etc.  I get that it gets crowded, just like any other club in LV - ok fine - but to pack you in like sardines so that you literally can't dance at all - screw that.  Not worth it, don't waste your time or money.  We had more fun bar hopping and dancing at several little spots around the strip.
It's one of the worst club that I've been to. Overrated! Went when Tiesto was there for my sister's BD....Long lines and they really try to pack as much people as they can in there. It's a disaster waiting to happen. People were pushing, shoving, and vomiting all over the place. There are definitely better clubs out there... Don't waste your money and time people! I gave them 1 star because their music was decent.. Other than that, very bad layout for a club.
I had an awesome time at Hakkasan on Saturday night. Tiesto was amazing. I love that he played some very sensual music near the end of the night. It totally transported me into another dimension...
Saw Tiesto here on Sunday night and it was a ridiculously good time. The dance floor was kinda packed, but I'd imagine that that had to do with the DJ. Also, got in for free thanks to Jeff, so if you're in town and looking to go, definitely text him and see if you can get on a list. 702-379-4592
What happens when you piss off a Saudi Prince? He will rain money till he destroys you.... . The Mega Hakkassan Night Club was created after a Middle East Billionaire was denied his favorite table at a club.. . "I am going to teach them a lesson" he said waving his finger... "I am going to build the best club with the best DJs" he said with his fist clenched. . With an unlimited budget he began construction of a palace in the middle of the desert that cost up to $100 million in construction costs and an additional $65 million to lock up all the best DJs like Tiesto and Dead Mau5. . . Hakassan is located at the MGM Grand and sports 3 floors of dance and entertainment. Two floors are dedicated to EDM music and the last floor is dedicated to Hip-Hop. . . Article is below:. . http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2012/dec/24/megabucks-djs-news-billionaire-spurned-vegas-backs/. . Atmosphere:. . Even though so much money was poured into this club...it was poorly designed. The club is so big that once you lose your friends you will never find them again. The dance floor is so small and packed that you have trouble breathing...there is so much pushing and shoving on the dance floor and sweat soaked bodies.... . When all the Vegas clubs are trending towards pool parties...Hakassan doesn't seem to be catching the drift.... . Service:. . The people who work here are not the best people. We reserved a table a month in advance and were quoted a price. On the day of the event we were told our table just went up by a couple thousand...It was then I realized reservation meant nothing...and table service was like an auction to the highest bidder...with the club trying to gouge you as much as possible.... . Tips:. If you want to get into this club best arrive before 11 PM and buy an electronic ticket online. . . Summary:. . Please do not go to this club unless you want to get raped on the dance floor...because trust me if you scream no one will hear you. . . They say money can't buy anything...and it applies to this club...you spend over $165 million it does not mean you will have the best club...Money doesn't BUY happiness. I am never coming back
I love the talent at hakkasan! Tiesto, hardwell, Calvin. . . The only downside is they pack this club to capacity. I however loved the promoter who picked me out of line and gave me a drink ticket and sent me right in the club without waiting in the guest list line. Thank you!. . I always have a good time at hakkasan! Usually the bartenders can be dicks, but this past visit he was super nice. Management you're doing an awesome job! Whatever you're doing at hakkasan please start doing that at wet republic because you need some improvements there.
It's fun.  Plenty of fun. Music is kicking.  Is there any bad place to party in Vegas though.  This is a good place.
Ruined our trip to Vegas!. We planned a trip to Vegas and wanted the highlight of the trip to go see tiesto. We planned, bought tickets, researched, etc. Before we started packing we called hakkasan and spoke with a lady (on speaker phone) about the dress code. She told us "business casual", when asked further if this meant jeans, nice shirt and tennis shoes was acceptable, she said "yes! Just no holes" . We stayed at planet Hollywood (which was amazing!) Didn't do a whole lot of spending money since we knew at tiesto drinks and things would be escalated prices.. We walked from planet hollywood to hakkasan, stood in line (which everyone was confused on the different lines) then had a security guy go through the line, look at my fiancee shoes and "out of line. You have to change shoes. They won't let you in." We were completely confused. Especially since the 2 guys behind us had on old dirty polos, cargo shorts and Sperry shoes! So we step out of line. I see 4 security guys talking by the door. I ask them seeing as we were given incorrect info and my fiancee didn't bring dress shoes and we won't be let in, what the refund policy was. One guy immediately said, "if you were told wrong and didn't get to use the tickets there should not be a problem getting your money back". . We walk all the way back to the hotel, gumming mad and pissed that the one event we really wanted to do, we now can't! We get to our room and my fiancee immediately calls hakkasan. They give him the run around and he persists. Finally the guy takes his name and number and promises to have a manager call him the next day.. This happened Saturday October 4th 2014. It is now October 10th 2014 and guess what.....NO CALL BACK!  . Such a waste of money for several employees errors, if they want to enforce a dress code, they should be more specific than "business casual" . What a waste and I will NEVER recommend anyone give them a penny! Horrible customer service and by the other revirws, unless you want to give them millions of dollars, they don't care about how they treat you!
Honestly, this is the prettiest club I have ever been too. Also,they have some of the best Djs there.  I personally don't mind crowds. However,if you get claustrophobic- watch out its super crowded in there!
Before I start, I'll say this: I don't like clubs. I'm 34 years old and not single... So there's no reason for me to be there. That said, this review is in no way influenced by that fact.. . i was a huge raver from circa 1995-2001, starting with deep house around 1994, until eventually becoming a total 'hardcore gabberhead' raver, that would wear masks with the word "house" in a circle with a line thru it... so even though i don't currently listen to EDM leisurely, i still can enjoy and appreciate that 'scene'. And i have been for years still, when certain friends want to do that for the night.. . And i know the deal: loud house music that leaves your ears ringing for days (i used to be a speaker-hugging Gabberhead) super tightly packed groups of humans, hot, sweaty and lots of pushing, shoving, uninvited contact and sometimes out of control emotions.. . But still... Hakkasan? Holy shit... maybe it's because Im mid-30s and a father now, that i think more about the fire hazard before i think about the 'energy'. But all i could think was "if we needed to get the fuck outta here, like NOW, we'd all be trampled in a huge bloody mess".. but i was still able to have SOME fun. But that's also because I chose to.... . It's real easy to lose your cool at this place and let it ruin your night. I chose to just go with it... the majority of my party didn't have the same thought tho. Understandably so.... . All the reviews you'll read on this place are spot-on, no doubt about it. And i probably brought that up about 20 times last night (when we attended Hakkasan). Like "Yep, the reviews all said it'd be like this" and "Yep, i totally expected this" but even with all that i was STILL shocked.. . They pack people in there like CRAAZY! And i mean it's so packed, that NOBODY has a chance, INCLUDING staff, INCLUDING "VIPs", nobody. It's so bad that i was feeling sorry for the staff, thinking holy shit and to think these people have to do this EVERY night?! My god, Id go insane.... one elevator attendant even said "Bro, you dont even wanna know" i said "Fuck NO i dont wanna know, i've seen enough!". . i know i haven't really gotten to a real "review" of this place yet, but look... it is what it is. Its SUPER packed. A Jameson and soda is $16. There's no place to walk, sit and BARELY stand. You will be touching at LEAST one other person at all times, whether you know them or not, and at some moments people might even mistake you for a brick wall and just lean their entire body weight on you.. . I think you can STILL salvage your night and have a good time if you go there already EXPECTING this. Because believe me, you won't be disappointed! But I still gave it 1 star, because well... this place sucks, haha.. . Oh and dress code, you CAN wear sneakers. You have a way better chance if your sneakers are paired with a collared shirt, or some type of creative, hipster-ish outfit. Use your best judgement. You know what these bouncers, who have the same attitude with their "authority" as a TSA agent, look for in people.. . And yes, forget about General Admission or Guest List, etc... buy presale, get there at 10, you'll be in super fast and you can have a chance to enjoy the place (for about 45 minutes) before it gets dangerously packed. I didnt get any asshole vibes from the bartenders, the staff was relatively cool (especially for their work environment) and the worst thing/people you'll have to deal with are drunk douchebags on the dance floor.. . If you plan on dancing, plan on dancing in one fixed spot, most likely just jumping straight up and down, and not without bumping someone constantly. Don't be a dick when you're there, MOVE if people are trying to get by, and be POLITE when YOU'RE trying to get by. Remember that nobody else is happy there (except for the DJs after they cash their $16 Million paycheck, lol) and that you CAN have a good time if you just allow yourself to.. . Still tho, 1 star... fuck this place, haha. Dangerous as hell.... expensive as hell... Vegas is too big to squeeze into one little hole like this one.
Went on a Sunday with my sister and her bf. we were a little skeptical of this place because of all of the mixed reviews but we love it here!. -Got on the guest list and got in no problem. Me my sister nor her bf had to pay cover. The line was a little long but surprisingly went by fast and one of the bouncers were really cool with us. All the staff we encountered that night were all nice. . -The drinks are of course on the expensive side. I ordered AMFs and those were $19 each. But the bartenders were really friendly and gave a lot of alcohol in those mixed drinks! Almost mixed with nothing lol but I'm not complaining! There are a couple different ones you can go to on by the dance floor, one in the back, and one upstairs. . -wear comfortable shoes ladies! There is absolutely no place to sit unless you have a table. Or at least bring flats, it's not too cute walking bare foot in a club or back to your hotel. . -lots of security around so even when this place is packed there's guys everywhere making sure the night goes smoothly. . -don't come already drunk! They won't let you inside if your stumbling around already. They might let you back in after a while or you might have to wait back in line. Just don't do it lol. -that night Tiesto played and he was amazing! We even had cool wristbands that light up when he played certain songs and went with the beat lol. . . Overall our night was amazing there and can't wait to go back to LV to come here again.
Don't get me wrong, they have amazing dj's and that is the ONLY thing I like about this place. . . This place is always overpacked and crowded. They should have a limit to how many people they allow inside because you literally feel like a pack of sardines. . . There is absolutely NO space to dance..  . The only way you can really enjoy yourself is if you reserve a table which of course, is expensive. And that is the only way I would ever come back.. . If you do decide to come, the guestlist is crap. So I recommend buying presale tickets instead and arrive before 11:30 because the place gets pack around 12am. . . Since this place is so packed, I suggest staying in one spot the entire night because it can easily be taken if you leave to buy a drink or take a bathroom break. Or have friends save that spot for you. . . If you plan on being on the floor, I recommend being in the front or middle with a group of friends to avoid people going in and out and getting in your way if you stay in the very back. It can be really frustrating the entire night.
I went to this place with a big group of people who had bought a table for the night. It was for the Calvin Harris concert so we expected the place to be pretty crazy but there were way too many people in the table area. The bouncers were constantly stressed out and yelling at us and randomly kicking out people in our group. They gave space priority to people who had paid more, even though we had already paid for our own table. The concert was great and the space is definitely really cool but it was just too chaotic.
Dear Hakkasan, . I'm writing this because I miss you. We haven't reunited since August, and it's now October. The last time we met, the Bingo Players (sadly only one bingo player now, poured some out) graced the stage. Before that, we bonded over Calvin Harris. Not to sound like a stalker, Hakkasan, but everything about you is perfect. . Downstairs (Ling Ling Club): Equivalent to a hip-hop room. Crazy vibe, dancing on every surface, and geisha-style dancers gettin' jiggy. Great spot to hit up for free bottle service before upstairs gets wild. . Upstairs (Main dance floor): When you enter, there's a large area to your right with a smaller bar and an area with lots of tables and seating areas, with an obstructed view of the stage. Straight ahead is the main dance floor, with large tables in a U-shape around (much like Marquee in this regard). There's another bar to your left, and tables on upper levels. I've never been up there, because I made it my personal goal to dance on the stage. Simply put, the customer service at Hakkasan is unrivaled. Anything you want at a table appears within minutes, any spilled drinks are immediately cleaned up, they even have shirts and shoes if someone spills on you. . So, Hakkasan, what I'm saying is that you are perfect, without even perfect imperfections. Come back to me.
I love this place me and my hubby celebrated our third anniversary there and everyone is so nice and helpful. they also have different sections to the club incas you don't like the music not only that they have an awesome sounds system! awesome lighting . I will definitely go back!
ASHLEY ANDERSON is by far the best server in the entire club. Not only is she friendly and welcoming but she makes sure your drinks are perfect! If you end up coming here, be sure to request her! You'll be disappointed if you don't.
Had such a good time here watching Tiesto. . . It gets full so arrive before 12. Drinks are expensive (four jager bombs for $75) but what do you expect, it's Vegas! . . The venue is pretty big and there's plenty of room to dance.. . Danced on throw up/drinks and still had a good time. That's how good of a time you'll have here!
Over rated and too crowded. To many people running into me. It was still fun. If you get in free its worth it but don't pay money to get in.
I've been here twice and it was a great time each time. Seen Tommy trash and most recently, Tiesto. Get in touch with the right promoter and you will get in quickly and hassle free. Amazing sound and light effects. Theres the main room which is edm and the ling ling room is hip hop..... Or as the elevator attending put it...... 'open format'.  Both rooms are fun and I love the ling ling lounge where u can sit and relax those sore feet in heels for a second. It's like a maze in here but easy to figure out. Friendly staff for the most part. Yes drinks are expensive..... $20 bucks per drink but hey its vegas and you are get to see a top dj for free (well at least we did)
Unless it's an artist performing, I'll be sure to skip Hakkasan.. Nothing here impressed me. Not the crowd. Not the music. Not the DJ. Sure, each individual song was nice on the night of 10/17. But the transition between songs was sh*t.. . The alcohol is ridiculously expensive. And if I come back, I will be sure to get a table.. . XS, you have a lifer here...
Great club! What it should be with a great sound system. Make sure you get a table i the theatre area as tehre is a hip hop room upstairs and also a back roomo where you can't see the performers.
I would say the hip hop room is managble except for the 50 year old ladies on the speakers hahah but more power to them for sure.the main roo. With tiesto had absolutely no room to move around let alone dance. A lot of stairs for the girls and actually not nearly as spacious as I thought. If you are on the guestlist come early ad the wait on that can be over an hour
The club was interesting but very cramped.  Packed full of people, it was hard to get a drink, dance, or go to the bathroom.  There was nearly no way to get to some open space to have a minute to breathe.  It is very similar to other nightclubs on the strip.  Nothing particularly special about it.
I'm here right now and am sitting next to someone Who works here who told me if I continue to ask him where my credit card is, which has been gone for 30 minutes - that he  will kick me out. I cannot imagine a worse place to spend my night then a place where people people like this exist.
Hakkasan was a pretty big disappointment for me.  After hearing so many people rave about it and being there it was not that great.  Yeah the venue is pretty nice and they have a hip hop room but it was SOcrowded I couldn't really enjoy myself!. . PROMOTER: I contacted Dan Stak (702-824-3234) and he was able to get me and my friends in for free! We had 2 guys and 6 girls.  He was very informative, texting me to make sure I got in the right line and answering all of my questions.  He even came to find me in line to make sure I was taken care of.  I would highly recommend him to get into Hakkasan and he got me on the guest list for Wet Republic too!. . WAIT: We got in line around 9:45, the line was near Rainforest Cafe and had to first wait in a small line labeled "guest list" and then move over to the "general admission" line.  The wait was about an hour until we got into the club and it did feel long but the line moved pretty quickly.  They checked our IDs and gave us stamps ahead of time and checked us out on the iPads before we got in so the process was pretty seamless.. . ATMOSPHERE: Once you walk in you go around to the main floor where there is a pretty big dance floor and tables surrounding it.  Go further and into the "ling ling club" which is where the hip hop music is.  The dance floor is TINY and although it was super dead when we first got there I could see how it was going to get super packed by the time everyone got in.  The drinks are expensive and only OK, and they charge you for water!!  Another sucky thing is that there is a lot of fog everywhere so pictures are horrible! They have this weird fog/haze in them that is hard to edit out :(. . Hip hop room music wasn't bad, they start out old school and then move into more modern stuff but we left around 12am to go to the EDM room to see Martin Garrix.. . The EDM room seems big but is super crowded.  I found a spot and didn't want to move because it would be IMPOSSIBLE to get back into the crowd.  No room to really dance but merely stand there and maybe wave your hand if you can.  People are kinda pushy and spill drinks easily -_-.  I left at 1:30am because it just wasn't fun anymore.  . . Overall, if you want to check it out to say you've been there maybe wait until it dies down some.  The venue is really pretty and nice but it's just so crowded so you don't have space to even enjoy the good hip hop music.
My girlfriends and I went on 10/26 to see The Weeknd. We showed up around 10 got in line with our promoters name waited in line for 5 minutes and walked in. The club itself was beautiful! From the decor to the way they treat their guest was def a 5 star place! After a few hours of dancing the club got really crowded and that was a bust because we couldn't move to dance anymore. It got so packed within the first 2 hours it was nuts. The drinks were super expensive but what else do you expect its VEGAS! The weeknd didn't show up until 2:15am but he was so worth the wait. he sang a couple of his old and new songs. The only disappointment was the club getting packed super quick and the drinks were to expensive.
I totally regret coming here instead of Marquee in our hotel! The reason this club is around is they book large edm names. We thought it's a weekday and we aren't sure what will be cool, since Steve aoki is playing at hakkasan-why don't we check it out? . . That was not a great plan.  We arrived around 11 and it was an insane amount of people standing around and down another hallway tons of people in line. We bypassed the line-likely because we were all girls. It was still $20. Funny enough this is way less than a cost of a ticket of it were a ticketed event.. . The decor is very nice but the main room isn't so unique that I wouldn't think it could be in another city. It certainly seems to be set upfor edm sets. Pretty good DJ viewing from all around and fun lights.  . . I had a great time the first hour to hour and a half. The crowd was in general pretty attractive and I had zero surprise grind from behind incidents and no creepy guys I had to swat off.  Bravo! I feel like the crowd had pretty good vibes and attitude but that might just had been the people around me. . . If only the club had stayed as it was for the first hour and half it would have been fantastic.  Unfortunately, the door must have kept letting people in because soon enough we felt like we were packed in Tokyo subway during rush hour. Even worse the dense sardine packing wasn't just on the dancefloor but everywhere, near the bar, in the hallways and pathways. Both my friends had cigarettes burn on them, not seemingly because those people are jerks but more because the club was too packed and provided no (at least obvious) smoking/getting air area. . . If you are an edm fan, wait until the DJ comes somewhere near you since will not be able to enjoy the music with so much smoosh. If you don't like edm I thought XS was a far more beautiful club. . . For management: there is enough of a market to make the events ticketed. I would have gladly paid more ($40-60 is what they charge in DC where I live) to see top talent and have an amazing night.
This club is impressive as far as esthetics. Very large in size, modern, and sleek.  Top things you should know about Hakkasan: . . 1. Having a promoter or purchasing tickets in advance is your best bet unless you want to spend a TON of money to get in, like $50-$100 expensive male or female.. . 2. You may want to pregame because drinks are about $17+ regardless of what you get, and a long wait at the bar. . . 3. Table service starts in the thousands if you want to sit.. . 4. Dress to impress. A lot of high profile clients go here to party so I'm sure it's not unusual to be turned away or discriminated against if you're not on your A-game. Typical at most Vegas clubs.. . 5. This club is known for its EDM headliners.. . 6. Ling Ling (the hip hop room) is much better than Marquee's Boom Box room. It's less cramped and sometimes there are guest DJ's here as well such as Nick Cannon and Rev Run to name a couple. Do your research to find out. There's also an ol school room nearby with more of a lounge vibe.. . 7. I wouldn't recommend for people who have a challenge walking long distances, or girls who wear really high heels. There are a lot of stairs here!! There is an elevator, but just be aware.. . . Overall, I gave Hakkasan a 3 compared to Marquee because Marquee has an outdoor area/dayclub, and there's a 24-hour pizza place upstairs next to Marquee lol. And Marquee really feels like an EXPERIENCE to me. It's more diverse and people seem to intermingle there more. Whereas at Hakkasan, either you're with the hardcore EDM crowd in the main room, or you're there to kick it at Ling Ling. Won't go here if I'm not comped... but if you're in town and want to get a feel for the nightlife here then definitely check it out.
