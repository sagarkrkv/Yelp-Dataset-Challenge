This place is delicious! Loved the shrimp and carne asada tacos. The elote was perfect! Definitely worth every cent! Great service!
This is by far my favorite place to get carne asada tacos!! Their salsa, their chips, their tortillas are amazing!!! My favorite is the cortada salad with shirmp added, along with their sangria. My husband loves this place as well/
The food is outstanding and deserved 4 stars but the poor service makes the experience truly negative. The staff is lazy and I my table had to request to be served! It went down hill from there totally unfriendly, no drink refills, no food descriptions, everything was a bother. The place was less than half full as it was 4pm on a Sunday. The restroom needed soap and cleaning, I brought this to the attention if the hostess. No action taken. Lots of staff standing around.. As great as the food was my party of 4 won't be back I will take my business somewhere else.
I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The place is hip and clean. They seemed understaffed BUT like another Yelper stated, "the food is worth the wait." If you go on Tuesdays, it is dollar-off certain tacos.. . The tacos I had were delectable - I will be back!. . A solid 5 stars for food and 3 stars for their lack of servers. (We had to wait a while to get our food).
The food here is great, the low stars are for the crappy service. I dined on a Friday night with 5 other people, I understand its a busy night but I don't understand the waiter who acted bothered every time we needed water or when we got our food that was cold. I ordered the carne asada burrito which was really good and we all shared the guacamole which was also very good. The second problem we encountered was when our checks came, as a party of 6 we were locked into a 20% tip, which was fine the problem is when we asked to to split the check three ways we got even more attitude from our unfriendly waiter. We wrote each total along with the amount to charge each card with our names on the receipt, no problem right? WRONG. I was charged an extra $80 that is still pending and when I pointed it out to the waiter he accused us of shorting him, saying he guesses he'll "eat the cost" pretty sure you just over charged us and got a 20% tip.. . Flash forward to the next week when I decided to give this place another chance, I called to make reservations and to make sure we were not seated in the waiters section we had had previously. I asked to speak to a manager and explained our first situation, he apologized but didn't seem to care to much. I asked to make reservations and he said well we already have two reservations so I don't think we can get you in, you can just walk up. Why i earthen would I want to just show up andwait for a half an hour? After my first experience you think they could squeeze in a party of 5- so finally he said I'll do it (like it was a favor). I showed up five minutes early with my entire party and was told there was no reservation and we'd just have to wait for a table. This is probably the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant especially after speaking with a manager. I probably won't be going back here any time soon, which is to bad because it's a cute place with good food.
Hands down the best Mexican food in Phoenix. And that says a lot with nearly an endless selection of Mexican restaurants across the valley.
Came here after reading some positive reviews on Yelp.  This, without a doubt, was the worst experience I've encountered at a restaurant in ages. Nobody in charge of this place, server completely inexperienced and no support from anyone else, had to get up 3 times to get water for our table from bar, after chip bowls emptied, it was 15 min for refill, two of our guests had enchiladas (after asking if they were spicy and told "no, totally mild" they were unbearable to eat.  Server said "that's  unusual" and after we had to ask to just get a plain quesadilla (we had been here over an hour w no food) it took another 15 min for cheese quesadilla. They charged us for the full meals (even though we ended up w a $2.00 appetizer) and server sends manager over to table who responds to our question of why are we being charged for meals we never ate with "you have a problem?...that's how they come". Unreal.  Would never return to this place.  It's one thing to have an inexperienced server but it is inexcusable to have the manager who takes the attitude that is absolutely not Customer focused.
Went to Gallo Blanco for the first time.  I really love the atmosphere.  The look of the place is great and it is a bonus that it is in a really great hotel.  We went on a Sunday and it was early enough that it was not busy.  We got seated right away and given our menus.  Our waitress was very friendly (it took awhile before we actually got service).  We ordered drinks from the happy hour specials. The margarita was good and the fresco was not unfortunately.  The waitress described it as a "moscow mule" but it was really bland and didn't have the flavor of a moscow mule.  The drinks took over 15 minutes to get the the table.  For an appetizer we got chips and salsa.  I really liked that the chips are served for with 4 different types of salsa.  They all tasted very fresh and were very good.  For dinner I ordered the Naco torta.  It was ok.   The flavor was good but the meat was stringy and a little fatty.  My friend ordered the tacos and they were very good.  So to sum up the food, it was good but nothing blew me away.  The service leaves quite a bit to be desired.  From the long wait for our drinks, to a long wait for our food.  Like I said earlier, our waitress was very nice but our waters ran out and were not filled for quite awhile.  When a person came over at the end and started clearing plates she took part of my food away, I wasn't finished and I was going to take the rest home.  I didn't realize she had taken that plate until we asked for boxes for the  rest of our food.  I am not sure if I will be back.  I think there are so many options out there that  good service is a big thing.  I could understand if they were busy, but therejust were not very many people in the restaurant.
A star because the food was good. The service was in all honesty the WORST service i have ever had and sadly my party tipped the awful waitress more than 20 percent when she deserved not a dime. She never checked on us..not even once when we were clearly out of water for over half an hour. So one of my party eventually got up and went to the waters station and took the water pitcher. We waited ourselves. The food was good but they couldnt even get it right which means not only did FOH suck at their jobs so did BOH. Manager came over and was sarcastic and giddy about how horrible the service was that he cracked a joke about it. All in all my out of town family was seriously disappointed and we will never return here. There are better Mexican food places in PHX for decent prices and better service. I advise EVERYONE to avoid this place and go somewhere authentic. Dont waste 8 dollars on a burrito with four things inside of it. Sorry staff but until you stop sucking youre losing my business.
Modern Mexican style spot: Friday happy hour time...If you order tacos on the patio be prepared to be attacked by flies.. . The weather is perfect so we decide to be seated outside.  We start with a margarita pitcher and guacamole which the highlight of it all was the 2 table sauces.  Thank goodness for the spicy green & red sauces to dress everything up.. . We get a tray of tacos: 2 fish, carne asada, veggie, shrimp, and pork.  It looks great once it arrives but 7 FLIES start aggressively bombarding us.  Thankfully the busboys must know about this and we put our tacos on our plate and they whisk the wooden & metal tray.  I cannot stand eating something a fly has landed on so I was waving my hand over my 3 tacos and shoveled them in as fast as possible.  As for the taste- the tortilla is homemade but very thick.  The carne asada was my favorite- love the marinaded flavor.  My veggie taco was lacking punch.  Fish tacos were very yummy.  My companion has the pork and shrimp which he seemed to enjoy.. . We ended with the lime tart at the recommendation of our sweet & server.  It was absolutely delicious with a nice serving of real whipped cream.  No flies at this time!
Easy review, I came here for a quick breakfast burrito before I hit the road for Texas. It was okay, hit the spot but wasn't anything monumental. . . Staff was ok but the overall dining area was kinda messy. Not sure how I feel about that.
The happy hour specials here are pretty solid.  $5 speciality drinks and decent prices for appetizers also.  I went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was packed. Good vibe and friendly staff.
Literally the best beef torta I've ever tasted! The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice.
I have lived next to Gallo Blanco for over 2 years. I call in pick up orders often.  The only reason I go back is the food is good and it's the closet place I can walk to.  Other than that everything else is poor.  The waiter and bartenders all have poor attitudes.  I won't order drinks at the bar because in the 2 years of coming it seems like all of them have an attitude.  I have witnessed bickering and arguments behind the bar between staff. This past Thursday I order a burro around 945pm.  When I got home it was cold, some of the meat wasn't fully cooked, and you can tell the prepping was rush the way things were cut.  This is the first time I experienced bad food here.  So I called and left a message on the voice mail for management stating my recipient number and issue.  I am yet to get a call back.  I have been in her many times and witnessed other complain about their experience and it doesn't seem like management cares.  This place would have more local traffic but everyone on my building has had a bad experience.  I would love to talk to a Manger again.  I did speak to one months ago about the bad experience but obviously things haven't changed.
The margaritas were awesome, great tequila. Queso fundido with chorizo was amazing. The pork belly tacos, rock fish tacos and cochinita tacos were great. The el churro banana split topped it all off. Amazing place to eat.
