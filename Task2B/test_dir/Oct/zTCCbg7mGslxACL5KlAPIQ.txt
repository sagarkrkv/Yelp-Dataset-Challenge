Came here with family and just want to try their buffet but it's not that good. Very disappointed. The service was pretty good but I don't think the food is fresh enough especially the seafood!
Went for lunch. About $25 per person. They had everything. However, only thing i liked was the roasted pork, Portuguese sausage, and their gelato. The Asian section was so gross...everything was stuck together in their little steamers. Their chicken dumplings look like they've been there for so long they turned black. Their Shao Mai have been steamed too long or re-steamed too many times so the skin is falling apart.  Not worth $25. Overall, everything was probably reheated from their leftovers from the night before. Not going back.
This is the best breakfast buffet I have ever had! The food is excellent and they have so many different types of food to satisfy any cravings. Would highly recommend.
Let me preface this review with, I hate buffets! My husband has dragged me to every buffet in Vegas and then some. I actually enjoyed my meal at The Buffet. Typical buffet when it comes to selection. They had seafood, Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and a carving station. The difference was the flavor! It was all delicious and much better than your average buffet experience. Desserts were fresh and delicious. My only complaint was the cheese platter looked a little old. The $12.99 unlimited champagne/beer/wine was great too!! Service was pleasant and I never had an empty glass!
Great selection of food, prime rib outstanding. Only negative you have to pay for your drinks at the table before you get them.
Not really impressed with the food quality.  They had the standard fare of thin crab legs, prime rib and assorted foods, but the quality wasn't there for me.  Perhaps I am on the road too much and have become too much of a food critic.  Next time I will use Yelp before I make my selection instead of when I do the review.
This is number one buffet for me!!!When I go to Vegas, I always have dinner at this wonderful place. I couldn't find something like aria buffet in Los Angeles, that's why sometimes we go to Las Vegas only for dinner at aria buffet) . Good choice of medeterenian, italian food. Different types of sea food. Always fresh and tasty!!!
I went to this buffet when it was newly renovated and I thought that it was a great buffet. The food was good and the service was great. However, when I went this past July the quality of the food was very disappointing. The crab legs were not steamed well as they were swimming in a pool of water by the time I got to the station, the prime rib was overdone and was told they didn't have anything that was on the rare side. However their service was still great as our waiter was very attentive and friendly and the pastries were still great.
This is my favorite buffet in Las Vegas, I went here for the first time in August 14' and I couldn't believe the quality of food at this buffet. . . They had surf and turf steaks with crab cooked on top. Awesome crab legs (I don't normally like crab) mexican food, Italian food, and awesome desert. . . This place was the best! And we had a wonderful waiter, I wish I could remember his name. He was an older gentlemen spoke Spanish and English and was very polite and kind to our table. . . :)
I went on 9/28/2014, Sunday night for dinner, pay over $35.  I wasn't too happy about quality of the food.  I went there before, hummas and babaganoush were really bland.  Curry chicken was ok.  The 2 things I really like were garlic mashes, and the steak they grilled in front of you.  Many people get crab which were opened already, but I don't really eat crab.   The place was good when I went in 2013 but the quality went down hill.
So disappointed by the average reviews on here!  I went to the Caesars Buffet in 2013 and I felt like the Aria beat Caesars hands down ten times over!  All of the food was SO good!!  They had so many great stations -- Asian, Indian, Seafood, Mediterranean, Meat Carving, Desserts, etc.  The meat station was amazing -- I was so impressed that the prime rib had a perfect medium rare on it, the leg of lamb was nice and tender with a great mint flavor, the dim sums were steamed perfectly, the snow crab and king crab was delicious, and even the sushi was amazing!  And the desserts -- omg the desserts were so amazing.  They even have gelato that they were hand scooping that was AMAZING.  And they have $12.99 all you can drink (beers, wines, champagnes, etc.)!  Cannot wait to come back here again for SURE!
Kept waiting in a line for a Buffett at entrance for 20 minutes ... No excuses!!!). . Dumb dumb
I did a comparison to the ARIA, Bellagio and Mirage buffets.  I will be quick.  Pick the ARIA it is the best choice of these by far and you wont wait forever in line.
got 2 free   dinner buffet from playing on myvegas.com . expected better food . most things I tried , didn't taste good . the only good thing was the made to order pasta station. dinner was 34.99 $  mon- thur
Whoever said the best things in life are free needs to have a firm talking to after the wife and I had dined here..I won a comp through MyVegas and I admit with mixed reviews I wanted to give this buffet a shot since it's Aria and all, but WOW did I ever regret that!. . My overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first, but disappointed as I walked around to scope things out. It does have your customary dessert area, asian area, mexican area, salad area, a tandoor area, and carving area. At one point I saw Area 51, but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunately!. . The food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where I only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..I tried a vegetable egg roll, pineapple sausage,  and orange chicken from the Asian station. I did find the egg roll to be cooked quite well and not too crispy like it was swimming in a day pool of grease. The orange chicken was hit or miss piece to piece. I had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.. . My highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the carving station, but that didn't totally "meat" the mark (pardon the pun)..The gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seem to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..I give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..THAT could be a whole other review in itself..The prime rib itself was very tender, BUT it did lack quite a bit of flavor..I drenched it in au jus, but still some bold flavor would've been appreciated. . Another notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..The shrimp itself was a high point and I did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the meat vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..I probably could've eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seem like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.. . I have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepted buffets in Vegas (seems like a dying breed of what once was), but I really hope that Aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..The staff was warm and inviting which is a saving grace, but an empty dining room during the pre Zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right?
Really not impressed at all. After waiting twenty minutes for a table (when half of them were empty, apparently they were trying not to open that section or something?), we sat down and waited for drinks. Ten minutes later, after not having seen a waitress, we decided to get food and figured we would order drinks when we got back. After finishing my first plate, I got up and asked one of the hostesses if she could send a waiter/waitress over to get our drinks, as ourselves and the other three tables around us were still waiting on that. . . She could have been polite. Instead, she literally told me that I was being impatient (no water or any other drinks after 20-25 minutes), and basically told me to sit down and be quiet, and that they'd get me drinks when they were ready to. . . We should have left then, and asked for a refund. The manager did very little to help, though she did say she would have a talk with her staff and see what happened. We got our drinks more than a half hour after being seated at our table, and the food was mediocre at best. I also had an upset stomach that afternoon, and that was the only thing I'd eaten since the day before. . . I only rated it two stars because the food was so-so, but it was pretty bland and after the entire experience, it was NOT worth it. I wouldn't go back, and the staff's rudeness has made certain that the Aria will not see another dollar our of my wallet.
If you like crab legs (whole, large, hot and cold) and homemade ice cream/gelato, this is the place to come. Those alone get five stars. Other items get a solid four stars. Nice open ambiance and great service. Go during lunch or late breakfast. Dinner is not really worth the extra price.
We love Vegas buffets!  Especially ones you can earn comps to by playing MyVegas through Facebook.  . . However, I think we'll pass on this one next time.  We've been here twice and simply not impressed.  The food is mediocre at best.  The prime rib was pretty much raw-medium-raw with lots of fat and for some reason just didn't taste good.  The spaghetti  and meatballs were bland, the Asian selections were also bland and not prepared well.  Even the gelato has a weird taste.. . The serve was OK, but not super friendly.  We just happened to have to have the same gentleman both times, last February, and this week in October. He delivers the drinks, and that's about it.  I ordered a Diet Coke and it came in a 12oz glass.  I can gulp that in 3 seconds or less.  It kept our server hoping.  He actually did a pretty good job but he appeared to working way to hard to keep up.
worst ever
My first Las Vegas buffet experience.. The spread is amazing, and to be honest I did not try even half of the food, but I was excited about the crab legs.. Crab legs were avg at best, although i did love that they put small cuts in them to make it extremely easy to eat. Prime rib was fantastic and surprisingly lean (the cut i got at least) Shrimp/Mussels and sushi selection was below avg. service also below avg.
Came here with a BOGO for lunch with my friend. The food was okay, but not being a buffet person, everything was just okay to me. Some stuff was way too salty or heavy, as usual. The best thing was their garlic mashed potatoes and their selection of meats. Their asian food is not good, crab legs are extremely salty. Indian, Greek, and Italian selections are small. Their desserts were pretty good, and loved the spinning ice cream wheel selection. Service was good here though, very attentive.
