3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:. . -The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).. . -Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.. . -Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said "have a great day", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.. . You get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.. . Go sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind..... . And finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.. . Charlotte....silly Charlotte.
Well Charlotte is always busy but reasonably easy to navigate to your next gate if your lay over is here.  I have flown many miles and I like this airport a lot
Its my first time at this airport.. And i hate layovers,  but they have really great stores to shop and eat.. Theres plenty places for wine and Tequilla and i just got a hot Cinnabon.. Theres a Jamba Juice, mexican spot and a place sit and have some delicious southern food! . . Plenty of resting spots where you can charge computers and mobile devices.. Its really fancy here and looks way better than the philadelphia airport where i am traveling too!! . . And wait... Did i just see a Brooks Brother store here too? Love it!! You wont be disappointed while waiting or connecting to your next flight!
Bathroom attendant doing a fine job, but this was the worst airport wifi experience I've had ... maybe ever. Huge waste of a layover.
I have to say this beats LAX JFK any day. They have options for everything you would need when you travel. My grandson needed a outlet for his phone. Found one. Than my wife and I had to wait for our flight to FL we had food and wine. I went with friends from my old bowling league and we found a buffet. I went by myself and read a book while watching the planes take off.  I have traveled a lot in my life and this always is a good experience.
I wouldn't usually write a review on an airport, but when I do it's because it really sucks. This airport was probably last updated the same year an American stepped foot on the moon. The aesthetics are an awful addition to the awful modern commercial flying experience. The bathrooms are super outdated and small. Also, instead of paying workers to keep the bathrooms clean once per hour or so, they have chosen to put in bathroom attendants that you would find at a cheap stripclup. These awkward attendants hover over you hoping for tips because they have mints, listerine and a paper towel ready after you wash your hands. If you're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard. As a major traveling hub for some airlines, this place needs a MAJOR RENNOVATION, FAST!
I've been through this airport numerous times throughout more than a decade my traveling back and forth between where I live and Boston to see my dad. I have to end up going through this airport in order to go to Boston, which is why I am so acquainted with this airport. I've never really had a problem until the last couple of years when I graduated from being a kid to being an adult which it wasn't required to have people wait on me as I got off the plane and stuff.. . That's not why I have a problem, though. I do like that they have a variety of shops and food outlets to choose from, especially a full Chili's in the airport. However, I understand that it takes money and such to build a big airport instead of a small airport to become technology friendly through the building and inputting of charging stations and more outlets to deal with the amount of charging of phones and such people would need to do in-between flights. I just found it vastly annoying that there still wasn't a lot of charging stations or great outlets to charge my phone. Since this summer, I actually had to PAY for wifi which was outrageous for me since it's offered free wifi in the past. I don't know if it was just me, but I could not get my hands on wifi without some kind of payment.. . The staff has been friendly as I don't think that the bathroom help is a nuisance and they do a good job. This summer, I was walking and a staff came about and asked if I wanted a ride since I looked tired so he called for a ride for me on the transport, which was great. I have had a pleasant experience as far as the staff was concerned. I even lost my ticket from Charlotte to Boston at one point and they just printed out a new one as soon as they saw my ID and everything. It wasn't a big deal and it was easy.. . I just think they should fix their outlet/charging problem and put in new charging stations and if it's true that you have to pay for your wifi now, then they should make it free again because it's ridiculous to pay for it when it's been free in the past.
As far as airports go, this one is my favorite by far. They did a good job showing Southern hospitality by airport standards if you are lucky enough to be stuck with a layover here. The atrium with the open air, sunlight, and rocking chairs definitely allow you some personal recharge time before you get back on another flight.. . The airport is mid-sized, not gigantic like Dallas, so you shouldn't feel extremely rushed to make it to the other side of the airport.
I like this airport so much that I moved here! They did this one right - parking, food, security, rocking chairs and the easy layout. My only other favorites are Long Beach and San Jose.
I like the ease of the small airport...curb drop off...shorter lines, etc.  However, with all of the recent parking garages added, more flights, and Charlotte's growth...they probably need to consider some internal renovations as well.  Forone, this is the South.  When you jam more bodies in small spaces, the temperature rises.  Add some more ventilation.  Second, folks are so paranoid about their boarding positions, everyone is lined up in mob style waiting to board.  This blocks all of the gate areas and does not allow for a good flow.  Maybe increase seating in gate areas or allow for additional space for boarding.  It's my home airport, so there isn't much I can do, but a few things might help us weary road warriors!
Parking at this airport is something out of a paradox.  From the outside it looks like this place has more parking than actual space for the airplanes.  However, trying to park here to fly out for a business or leisure trip has been something out of a time vortex where nothing makes any sense.  The signs are not set up to streamline people coming to this airport to park and fly out.  I was almost late for a business flight since I was so confused on where to park and where to go.  Inside has a decent amount of restaurants and to my surprise designer shops.  More to my surprise is how these shops afford to stay open since most of their items for sale is beyond what anyone would pay for and there is never anyone in there.  Unsolved mysteries indeed.
I've been to so many airports over the years that I can't even name them all. In the morning, this airport is certainly quiet. But it's also dead. I came in on a red eye. By 6, almost nothing in the D terminal is open. And the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets. While it's nice to have charging stations by the gates, travelers who work like to sit down and enjoy their meal while banging out some work and charging their equip. More restaurants with outlets and open before 7 for early travelers would go a long way to improving this place.
Being a pretty seasoned Traveller this airport is actually a pretty good one in comparison. They are making some needed upgrades but it's still relatively clean and modern. Looking forward to the much needed new parking deck.. . I know people complain about the "hustlers" in the bathroom. But hey they DO keep the bathrooms clean and work very hard for that dollar tip! So I'm not going to complain.. . Decent food choices but pick the right ones even if you have to venture into another terminal.
Great airport.  I will do my connection through this airport if I have a cost effective option to do so, and i don't mind doing longer layovers here. . . Clean airport, attendants in bathrooms, good selection of food establishments, decent prices, sufficient places to sit, with seating also near outlets to charge your devices.
The "moving sidewalks" make it efficient to get to your gate quickly through the hustle and bustle. . . Not enough time for food between connections, so no comment.
This airport has not evolved or grown to accommodate its business. Similar to PHL; it is over capacity at each gate, does not have enough power outlets (let alone designated power stations), and lack of hot food choices in each terminal make is a dismal place for a layover.. . I personally feel awkward with bathroom attendants present as well. I prefer not to have an audience.
First things first, it's an airport not a resort, so my review has been scaled down for that. We landed here at 9AM for a layover to Dominican Republic.  Chairs are not the worst ones I've seen, but a big plus is that the Wi-Fi is free, so watch as much Netflix as you want. Bathrooms are clean and restaurants are pretty good.
Blink twice and you'll think you're at JFK or LAX.  This airport was surprisingly busy.  I was shocked being that Charlotte has a population of less than a million people.  But I understand the number of travelers given it's a primary hub for U.S. Airways... (Ick...don't even get me started).  . . It has all of the normal accommodations of your average airport; large food court, shops and several business centers.  What it lacks is a decent size rental car counter and larger waiting areas.  All in all...okay airport.
I have been going to the airport a lot in the last 10 months since I just moved to Charlotte and my family has been visiting.  I think it is a beautiful airport and everything seem to run smoothly.  Only occasionally have I had to stand in a long security line and everyone has been very pleasant.
Women in baggage claim lied about where my bag was as they wouldn't even look it up in their computer. After burping Chinese food in my face and refusing to look in the computer I accepted what they were telling me only to arrive at my destination bag less. . . Unprofessional, lazy and making a bad name for the South.
One of the smallest airport in the U.S.  Flew here for a short layover to Greenville (GSP).  Can't really stand small airport since all the planes are so small and me being 6'4" is very difficult to sit comfortably in my seat.  Next time I'll fly into big airports.
I'm here every week, and in comparison to the numerous other airports I experience, CLT is definitely the best. There are many food and options available regardless of your airline or gate. At most airports there are a few for each terminal and they are not accessible to all gates or require significant walking. . . At CLT there are options throughout the airport and a central hub that makes getting around easy without the trams and monorails other airports require, which is great when you're in a hurry. . . Daily parking is also relatively cheap and convenient compared to the prices at other "hub" airports. I'm looking forward to the completion of the additional parking which should alleviate the congestion and make my time in and out even faster.
We have to fly through this airport every time we visit my family who live in South Carolina. I am not a fan. . . First of all, no matter what time if year, this airport is always freezing. There is a large glass atrium which is kind of like a hub for all the terminals. The atrium is pretty with several places to grab a bite to eat including Chilis, Carolina Pit BBQ, Cinnabun, Tequileria, etc. The Atrium would be a cool place to sit and grab a bite while watching airplanes take off and land but the temperatures are always arctic! I would guess this maybe has something to do with all the glass but no clue. . . This airport is not family friendly. There is nothing like the convenience of a Family Bathroom when you are traveling with an infant. While this airport has several Family Bathrooms, they are always locked and never available for use. Because of this, I am forced to change her in the crowded restroom while my stroller, diaper bag, body, etc block the traffic flow of people trying to get in and out. This is so frustrating!. . Every other time I fly out of this airport, there is some kind of problem with our tickets or some crazy delay. I think I've spent more time sitting in a delayed plane on the Charlotte Tarmac than I have in the actual airport (probably not but it sure feels like it and being delayed with an infant is not fun!) . . I'd say avoid it if you can, but you probably can't so, in that case, just be sure to bring socks and a sweater!
5 stars for being clean, bright, spacious, and having a good variety of food options!. . Unfortunately, I'm now 2 for 2 in getting delayed an hour or more leaving this airport. They just don't want anyone to leave. Make sure you get on board with a fully-charged phone, cause you may be sitting on the Tarmac for awhile.
