Nice hotel! I like to stay here all the time. Eventho they have no cirque du soleil shows and it's preety boring here beside.. The parties at the marquee are preety annoying and the drunk people control the hotel.
Very nice place for a conference or business meeting. I recommend the rooms atthe 27th floor or higher facing the Bellagio. One of the best views I've ever experienced. Very stylish and comfortable rooms. Fully equipped with dishwasher, sink, fridge and microwave. Bathrooms are world class.
I'm a believer! I really like the Cosmo. It's new, so doesn't have that nasty vegas hoar smell yet - you know that cigarette/sweat/hangover/deodorizer smell?. . We upgraded our room for $40 and have a spectacular view of the bellagio fountains. They have a comfiest chair out there for you too.. . Ate at STK last night and it was just awesome. The wague sliders with foi are off the hook. Same for the mashed potatoes, and the potstickers. We tried a bunch of items, but these were worth writing home about.. . I wish they had a convenience store in the lobby. Somewhere to buy cheep snacks, and a 6 pack of beer. I miss that. Also, not great shopping.. . The chandelier bar is very awesome. Try the verbena. It come with a flower that you eat, and it makes your mouth numb. Fun party trick!
When I come to Vegas for work, the Four Seasons is my home away from home... but when I come to Vegas for play, Cosmo is my one and only. This hotel has everything you could ask for for a party weekend- a central location on the Strip, gorgeous decor, beautiful people, great nightclubs (especially Rose.Rabbit.Lie), top restaurants, even the Rent the Runway store in case you need to elevate your outfit for the evening. The fantastic customer service and the little touches in the rooms really propel this hotel into luxury status, and the prices are quite affordable given that almost every window has a gorgeous view of the Bellagio Fountain.
Great sexy hotel. Not the ritz but very fun. Rooms are excellent. Service is good. If you want a club experience hotel with that kind of glitz, this is it. We got a spacious, sexy room. I have connections so I don't want to say what I paid but if i paid $500 to $700 a night i would look around. I was in a 1000 sq ft suite w a balcony. 51st floor with great views. The ritz for me is the 5 star standard so I give this place a 4 star. Reminds me of Fountain Bleu in Miami but better service. Not a kid friendly place. Just be aware. Hot people all over like us ;-)
I used to love this hotel, so much so that I tried to book a block of rooms for 15 employees during the holiday. The guy I worked with in group sales is incredibly rude. He didn't like my response to his quote so he ignored the 3 emails and 2 calls that followed. . . Unless he got hit by a bus there is absolutely no excuse for this level of horrible customer service! I will never stay here for business or pleasure. . . Tons of options in Vegas, spend your money where they actually care about your business.
After a few days i must say i love this place. Staff is great, food awesome, hot clubs w free entry if your a guest!!! Yay! Room is spectacular with views. Location is awesome. Beautiful people all over. Reminds me of fountainbleu in miami with a nicer, caring staff. I will stay here again!!! You guys rock! I also stay at Ritz and 4 seasons. Not a family place but a high class party place!
This was our second visit to the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, We just had to come back and visit this modern awe of a hotel! The lobby strikes you again with the amazing changing columns-pillars, the check in queue wasn't that bad and only had to wait around 10 minutes, the check in clerk came to greet us and shook our hands our welcomed us to the Cosmopolitan, we had booked a One bedroom Terrace and got a free upgrade to a One bedroom Terrace Bellagio View on the 59th floor in the West Tower. . . Our suite was massive and the view of the Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains was incredible.. . We used the Bamboo Pool and Boulevard Pool, the Bamboo Pool was more relaxing and the Blvd pool is mainly for the party people but we had a great time in both.. . The whole place is massive and you can easily get lost but all the people who work there are really friendly.. . It still is one of the best Hotels on the strip in my opinion and whenever I'm back in Vegas ill be staying here.
Instead if going to the usually well known resorts. This hotel was something that I haven't visited.  . . It was nice.  There was a club right when you walk in.
So, last Saturday, my friends and I flew out to Vegas to have some fun and decided on The Cosmopolitan for our first night out.  A very mixed experience!  First we headed over to STK where we had dinner and then decided to have a drink at the bar but quickly decided to go elsewhere because the 2 ladies behind the bar were rude.. . We made our way over to Vesper.  Wow!  So much talent with a friendly welcome.  The drink was so good and I highly recommend it!. . Now comes to our final destination: The Chandelier Bar.  We settled in to the second floor but not for long.  We sat next to the service station and notice something disgusting.  A drink was sitting there with the drink ticket INSIDE THE DRINK.  YUCK!  I took a picture and posted it here on Yelp.  Needless to say, I would never go back to Chandelier.  And it kind of makes me wonder what else happens behind the scenes at the other venues.
Pros:  Room was very nice.  Thankfully I wasn't paying the $300 a night bill though. Roomy, spacious, very nice view.  The shower was amazing...big enough for 2 people to have a reeallllly intimate shower together. Not sure why there was a kitchen with dishwasher and microwave in the room...isn't the objective for guests to buy food from the hotel or the restaurants within?   Cons: room was too hard to find, and hotel was way too big and the whole place stinks of cigs.  But then again, I have the same gripe about almost every Vegas hotel.  Don't put a finger on the mini bar or the alcohol in the fridge or else you will be charged! haha
It's the scene to be seen.. . The ultimate party hotel in Vegas. From the risque lobby video pillars, to every bar in the lobby, to Marqee (both day and night clubs), the whole hotel just oozes of sexy. While every party hotel claims to have this, only the Cosmo has it in almost every part of the hotel. EVERY part. That's right, valet pool, lobby lounge, bar, elevators, tables, hotel room.... and maybe even a few of the housekeepers (no... really).. . What many Cosmo visitors don't realize is that the Vesper Bar in the lobby lounge is one of the top ranked in Vegas for craft cocktails. This place is legit. One of the best, with cream-of-the-crop mixologists, and a cocktail menu to make even New York's elite envious. . . Chandelier bar? It's like a classic yester-year tribute to old Vegas, a la Liberace, complete with overkill and Moet.. . This is old skool Vegas reborn.
from the moment you see the Cosmo to the moment you wave goodbye you are amazed. Almost every single person working at the hotel was friendly, kind and helpful (except the girl at the pool handing out the towels...she was probably mad she couldn't enjoy the pool with us). I would definitely stay here again and again and again!! The only part of the hotel I disliked was when we got off the elevators to our floors the area looked old and worn and smelled of cigarette. a renovation in the near future would be helpful because everything else at the hotel seems so clean and beautiful.
This is a long overdue review. My friend and I were groped by some pathetic guy while walking through the lobby on NYE two years ago. I was asked by the bouncers whether I wanted to press charges and Isaid yes, of course. They brought my husband and I to a back room and, after interrogating me a bit (nice, right?), they told us it would take "four hours" for the police to get there to file a report and we could wait, or just let it go. We saw them treat a girl who was by herself even worse while we were back there - I wonder what terrible thing she had been through.. . From that time I vowed to never set foot in that hotel again. If that's how they treat a woman who's groped, imagine if something worse happened? I don't think they even kicked the guy out of the hotel. Awesome way to treat women. Oh, and I'm pretty sure I got nasty food poisoning from one of their restaurants.
Beautiful hotel! So much to do - you really don't even need to leave. One thing to note, there not much privacy in the bathroom. I was sharing a room with 3 other girls, and since the shower is glass, no one could get read in the bathroom area while someone was showering. It wasn't too much trouble as there are plenty of mirrors in the main room. The balcony was nice and I loved the scent of the complimentary shampoo/conditioner/lotion. . Service was a little slow at the Blvd pool. However, it was quite convenient to have (ice cold!) water available at the bar in a dispenser so that you could fill at your leisure. The Wicked Spoon was excellent for brunch and we enjoyed late night pizza both nights at the hidden pizza joint :) Chandelier bar is GORGEOUS, a must go for at least one drink!!
5 stars is for the room. The wrap around terrace room to be exact.  Make sure your room is in the East Tower.  While I am sure the West Tower is nice, the long walk back by the convention meeting room areas seems so desolate.. . The hotel itself has a nice location and has a good mix of semi-casual restaurants on the 4th floor.  If you want to try something unique, book a reservation at Rose Rabbit Lie.  The dinner theatre will be a first for most people.  The hotel Is currently the choice of the upscale non-clubbing scene between the late 20s-50 year old set crowd of pretty people.  If you decide to go casual with a t-shirt and shorts, you will look terribly foolish and probably feel uncomfortable.. . Gambling area has distracting female dancers in an array of black catsuits to take your mind off of any card counting you're doing.  The Chandelier Bar is a great 2 story social bar set in the middle of the hotel.  Do keep an eye out for the "local talent" as my friend thought he was getting lucky until he found it might cost him something extra.  Anyhow, I find this bar to be the one I end up at even when staying at other hotels.. . The rooms are fairly priced. A recent 6 day stay cost $2200 for a room that was high grade during a busy convention time.   The wraparound balcony faced the Bellagio and we were treated to a nightly water show.  The bedroom opened out to the balcony so you could sit outside as you deemed suitable.  The bathroom has both a jacuzzi tub for two and a large glass shower with dual sinks and a separate water closet.  . . The room also comes with a full kitchenette and lounge and entertainment center.  Although you probably won't do any cooking, the suite allows you all the room to entertain a small party or to keep separate if one person wants to retire early or sleep in.. . All in all the room feels like a luxurious New York bachelor pad, hence "the Cosmopolitan".  Definitely the current "it" hotel for those looking for that jet-setter feel.
I love this hotel. I think the location is great, the decor is fun, sleek, modern, and the casino never seems too overly smokey.. . Last trip we stayed in one of the smaller suites and paid extra for the view. Wow is that worth it! Spent most of our time on our balcony just enjoying the weather, the strip, and of course the Bellagio fountain. The balconies have little comfy chairs on them, perfect for lounging with your morning coffee!. . The suites are adorable. I love the setup of each. I definitely feel fabulous when staying in this hotel. The bathroom is so beautiful, there's windows from the shower/bathroom into the bedroom, and there's a living room within your room. It's adorable. . . The room service breakfast option is great. It's Vegas so of course it's pricey! But if you're on vacation you've gotta celebrate and spoil yourself a bit. You can fill out a card with all you want for your morning meal, put it on your door before 2am and you get breakfast delivered at the time you choose! They bring in a table with everything and set it up wherever you want, even the balcony if you choose. . . Only complaint about last time is that our room smelled like cigarettes (on a non smoking floor), and cologne. It was almost like they were trying really hard to cover up smells and it ended up making my allergies go crazy!!!
honestly not impressed AT ALL. I have also stayed at MGM and The Venetian which both far exceeded this hotel. we got a room on the 40th floor facing the strip and fountains but started noticing our room was absolutely filthy- finger prints and dust on everything. makeup all over bathroom walls and blood stains by the window walls, there were little gross black hairs all over both beds. they moved us to a new room on the 32 floor facing a parking lot......... not okay. to make things worse our room smelled like smoke so they brought a machine to purify the air, then our heat wouldn't work so the maintenance man tried fixing it for an hour (he was by far the nicest hotel employee and the only reason I gave 2 stars). the hallway carpets are disgusting as well, everything just feels gross.. . overall-very very dirty for a "5 star hotel" this is pathetic. I wouldn't stay here again.. . okay end rant
Excellent tables, excellent people, drink service was excellent. I Do not have any negativity to share about the Cosmo.
I didn't stay here but boy I spent some time in here!!  The chandelier bar is AMAZING!!!!  This is what Vegas is all about!  I had so much fun here, I will definitely stay here when I return to vegas!!  It's all that and a bag of glitz!!!!
My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night. Everything was perfect. Beautiful room with an incredible view. A little pricy on the weekends but well worth it. Deducted a star because they messed up our reservation and it took an hour of my entire wedding party talking to different managers to finally get the problem resolved. Once they finally got us our keys we had an amazing time.
This is the worst venue for a concert.. #brunomars concert avoid at all costs.. never again will I ever come here for a concert
Beautiful hotel in the middle of the stripe.  Best night club marquee is here and if show ur room key it's free admission (even better) the lay out is alittle confusing. Go to the pool on the 4th floor if you don't go to marquee pool party (which it's not free)
This is a review based on customer service for the hotel and how they treat loyal guests for over 3 years...Since the inception of the Hotel I've always been comped a room for anytime I'd like to come out.  After 3 years of staying there now I'm being told that based on their 98% occupancy (which anyone who goes to vegas knows now is offseason) those comps are no longer available.  So for 3 years of never paying for a room you now want to charge me.  The worst they did was let Kendall Brasch go from their VIP services dept.   In saying this I will not be staying there anymore and this VP gentleman I just spoke with Jim (don't remember his last name) was just horrible onn the phone and couldn't answer any questions as to why the comps went away.  All in all back to the Wynn where at least they're LOYAL to their clients!
Overall a nice place to stay, with a few issues.. . First, we are locals and booked a stay here to visit with my parents who came by for a farewell reunion before I leave for the middle east.  My parents are getting up in age and have mobility issues.  The one thing my mother loves is visiting the pools at a hotel, and she will base her hotel selection on the pool alone.  She researched the Cosmo and saw the bamboo pool; a nice, quite, relaxing pool area.  She then called the hotel to confirm that the pool would still be open the third week of October.  She was told specifically that ALL pools would be open until 27 Oct.  THEY LIED. When they checked in, they were told that the Bamboo pool would be closed during their stay.  The main pool that was open is oriented towards younger visitors and plays loud music, not great for an older guest.  They were also put in the opposite tower, based on the Bamboo pool being open, now the walk was too far.  I would have called my credit card, cancelled authorization and walked away from the front desk, but they are nicer than I am.  After the first day, they were moved to the east tower, so at least they could get to the open pool.  This entire sequence is UNACCEPTABLE.  If you tell guests that a facility will be open, it better be open unless something unforeseen happens (there were no issues).. . Now to our stay/room; nice room, spacious, expensive.  The shower is very quirky and difficult to set a constant temperature.  The tub was trendy, but not highly functional.  Climbing in/out is a bit of a chore and it is not wide enough to stretch your legs.  We had an issue with cooling the room.  The bedroom thermostat went down to 65 degrees, but the bedroom never got near that temp.  We called guest services the last night and they claimed to have fixed it, but it remained the same.  The balcony was nice, but the sliding door was almost impossible to open.. . Overall, a good room, but you over pay for it.  The misinformation about the pools is unforgivable.
Stayed at The Cosmopolitan for 3 amazing nights the last week of September and I can't stop talking about it! Upon arriving at the hotel our room was upgraded to a room with a balcony on a high floor which had a nice view. Everything about this place was VEGAS, there was always a good time to be had regardless of the time of day or night. We went to Marquee on Monday and had a great time. The casino was also great, it was very lively even late at night. One of my favorite finds at the cosmopolitain was the secret pizza kitchen/ the sicilian white pizza is one of the best slices I've had in my life. . . The gym was nice, the mojitos by the pool were delicious and the rooms were modern and comfortable. I could go on and on ... I really have no complaints about the cosmo, it was an amazing time and I hope to be back soon!
We originally went here to check out the pool, but were bummed to find out it is only open to guests at the hotel. However, we had a nice time wandering around and we even saw a really cool live jazz sextet in the lobby under the chandelier. I would love to stay here sometime to get the full experience.
I love how the slogan here is :. . "Just the right amount of wrong". . My gf and I tend to go to Vegas often because it's a quick and easy trip and the hotels are top notch for competitive prices. We booked our stay 2 months in advance and it came with $100 dining credit. We got the terrace suite with a balcony facing the bellagio fountains with the japanese washing tubs and it was an awesome experience. As for our room, it was huge! We could have easily fitted 15 people in our room because we had 3 sections, the bed room, the dressing room area and the living room area. Additionally, when one of our fridges broke down, they came right away with another mini fridge so we ended up having two fridges during our stay. :). . . The service here is top notch from top to bottom. The concierges here are super helpful and they respond instantly. My gf loved all of our concierges because they were all feisty and fabulous. Oh dear. XD. The valet system here is crazy because you just scan your code into a system and you sit in a lounge area while they pull up your car. Definitely beats Vdara and Aria's valet system. Moreover, I don't usually care about the bath room products too much but Cosmo soaps are amazing. I love peppermint soap! When we called for extra soap they were like "how many do you want!". . The amenities here are endless, from dining, clubbing and shopping.. . For you night animals, if you stay here on any days from Monday to Friday, you get comp access to Marquee which is a deal because they have awesome djs all the time like Kaskade and Dash Berlin. Pretty sweet because I would hate to pay the $50 to get in. . . As for dining, we used our credit to eat at secret pizza, Holsteins and Wicked Spoon and all of them provided top notch quality food for us. You can read my reviews of each spot separately.. . Also, during the summer time. They have movies playing at the pool which is really cool. Sitting on a water foam bed while watching classics like jurassic park and ET!. . Additionally, the gym's view was amazing. I usually don't care about the gyms but the treadmill's view is the freaking bellagio fountains! They give free earphones and apples here as well.. . As for shopping, they have plenty of options and if you want more high end shopping, you can walk over to the city center. That's the thing I love about the cosmo is it's location, it's in the middle of the strip and you get the best possible view of the strip here.. . Overall, our experience here was top notch. My gf fell in love with the cosmo and she adores the bellagio fountain and strip views from this location.. . I might be wrong about a lot of places but this place definitely gets it right! ;)
Very nice hotel in a perfect location. The amenities are perfect, tuns of restaurant choices, and extremely friendly staff. Make sure to request the Bellagio veiw.
The Manager of the Group Sales Department reached out to me on Yelp and invited me to reach out to her to let her know what had happened. I sent her an email but never got a response. . . On the same day miraculously I received an email from the original rep (more than a month after our initial correspondence) asking if there was anything he could do. I had some choice words in my reply, which he apparently forwarded to his boss. Within an hour I received an email from his boss along with 4 recall attempts on the message. As I looked at her email I noticed she had neglected to remove the reps commentary from the email he forwarded basically saying I'm a liar and he did nothing wrong. . . Classless and unprofessional! Good luck Cosmopolitan with a circus act like this in charge!
We spent 4 nights at this hotel, accepted the upgrade for a few more dollars and it's worth the money: a Japanese tub with a great view, bed is more than comfortable and the space is great. It's good to have on the TV app (2 TVs BTW) every charge to your room including the Mini-bar charges just seconds after you grab something and its easy to Check-out so you don't have to make line in the lobby. . Awesome and near almost everything on the Strip.
For an all-girls Vegas trip? For a group of 20-somethings looking to party? I wouldn't stay anywhere else. . . A very young and hip hotel, (thankfully) don't expect the mom and pops kind of crowd when staying here. The entire hotel's motif is sexy and modern, a perfect and dangerous Vegas combo. I did not encounter a staff member that didn't show the utmost professionalism and respect, even when we ran into a few mishaps with the room we were staying in. They were especially accommodating to our requests and were easy to communicate with. . . I would suggest requesting to stay on the East End (with much better views) rather than the West; although, the West End is much closer to concierge and the taxi pick-up and drop-off if that's of more importance to you. . . That's really all there is...I'd say more, but that would totally go against the "What Happens in Vegas" saying, and I really don't feel like having to explain this review to my friends.
The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas is a very stylish and quite hip hotel on the Las Vegas strip, ideally located between the lavish Bellagio Hotel and the fashionable City Center, across fromthe magnificent Paris Las Vegas Hotel and the rather understated Planet Hollywood Hotel, right in the middle of the famous  strip.  If your dream is to be in the center of it all, this is the place to be!  . . The rooms are exceptionally stylish and really do live up to and exemplify "cosmopolitan".  My view from the 25th floor presented breathtaking vistas of the Bellagio water show and the Eiffel Tower of the Paris and much more eye candy on the strip.  . Be sure to request a room with such a great panorama of Vegas with which to take in the spectacle!. . While I truly loved and enjoyed the room and the service of the hotel, there was surprisingly no coffee maker or alarm clock/radio in the room and the windows were far overdue for a cleaning, which did distract somewhat from that spectacular view, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.. . All and all, this hotel is swank and sophisticated, both a great place for a business conference or just decadent Las Vegas vice, and well worth a stay.  One more thing, the Chandelier Bar is absolutely spectacular and must not be missed!
Summary - stylish, upscale hotel in mid-strip with the most beautiful clientele and great restaurants, but a bit "cold".... +. I rented a Terrace Studio with a friend - two queen beds, tub and shower, kitchenette (microwave, sink)  and living room area. Outside Terrace with great view. Good wifi. On paper the best ever. But not enough drawer space, and while elegant, completely lacking in charm. After Day 1 my friend moved to the Paris where he got a deal on a Premier Red Room (upgraded with a view) which while not as luxurious, and no terrace or microwave, had more charm (and the Paris is not nearly as nice or cool hotel as Cosmo). The Cosmo is the most happening hotel in Vegas - always packed with beautiful young things, and the bars are elegant. Secret Pizza is good (like an average NY pizzeria), China Poblano is awesome, and the buffet is good but not great. For big shots there are good odds Video Poker machines in the high limit room, and if you avoid the 6:5 blackjack there are reasonable BJ games.  . . As an older happily married man I prefer the Encore or Vdara. The Mandarin is even nicer but too expensive. But I will probably go back to the Cosmo if they make me a good offer - there is nothing major to complain about...
