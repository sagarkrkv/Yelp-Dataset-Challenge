Even tho I chipped a tooth on bacon... the food was so tasty.... . We went to the location at the M hotel....
Love this place. Clean friendly atmosphere. The food is great and huge servings so bring your appetite or better yet a frind to share it with.
Okay for all that are complaining about the long lines, rude people, crowded parking lots!! Get over it! The long lines are because you, me, and everyone else are coming to a great place. If the place sucks like I keep seeing people post here, then that would take care of the long line problem. Costco ROCKS!! When you get free samples of foods, all of the sudden people are like piranha LOL!! They get pushy and all sorts of greedy!! It's human nature and its kind of funny to watch! Get over it!! Then the crowded parking lots: refer to the long lines section! Costco ROCKS!! People wouldn't be crowding in there if it didn't! I have been shopping there for the last 25 years and will never stop!! And it def beats out Sams Club any day of the week for selections, return policies, and great employees! So quit whining and enjoy a great thing!! :)
Outrageous.  Over the top.  A must place to visit.  I had the pork tenderloin and had 3+ meals out of it.  Our party also had the Kokomo.  It's worth the drive just for the rolls.  We watched in amazement as dish after dish came out of the kitchen - each one met with Ooh's and Aahs as the wait staff delivered it.  Great service, amazing presentation.
So far, every item I've ever ordered from Hash House has been amazing.  Sometimes, their staff can take their sweet time but for the most part, are very courteous and offer decent suggestions.  Pricing is a bit expensive for the experience "from farm to table" so to speak, but the portions are huge and can easily be shared between two people.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should at least once, but I prefer going there for dinner versus breakfast due to large crowd/massive wait times in the a.m.
Great food, huge portions and decent prices for what you get. Don't get sticker shock at the prices. Most dishes are plenty enough for 2 people to share. Sad they shut down the location at M resort, but the one a Plaza is just as tasty.
This place has a unique taste on food, The portions are huge and the taste is down home comfort food. From the huge pancakes, to the twisted meatloaf, you will never be disappointed when dining here. The decor is nice, and on your way in or out you can see pictures of famous dinners. I had a burger that had avocado and bacon on it, it was huge and full of flavor you can tell their meat is never frozen. The servers were friendly and added to the experience. This place gets top ratings due to the friendly atmospher and quality of food.
I came to this place because of the great reviews. I went on a Saturday at around 11am and had to wait 45 minutes to an hour.   If you play the penny slots nearby the wait isn't so bad. Finally we were seated and ordered the chicken and waffles and Andy's Benedict. I really loved the chicken and waffles, the Benedict was good but not as great as I would've liked. My favorite was the biscuit and the mashed potatoes but I wasn't too crazy about the sauce that was all over it (a little spicy). Presentation and portions are definitely impressive. I was happy to take huge leftovers for later in the day. Overall I think I would come back if I come to vegas with friends that haven't been here before.  Decently priced for vegas as well.
bleh! this place is over rated! too big on size but lacking in taste. if u want BIG serving then its a good place to go, but im a person who go after the quality not quantity. :( sorry i
Food that's art! Delicious art!
The wait here is going to he long on the weekend but they are very straight forward about that, and very conscious about seething expectations.  The food here is excellent and the service is even better.  Our server, nate, was very knowledgable and friendly.  We will always go here when in Vegas.
Big Fan.. . This place has one of the best breakfast's ever. I love shnitzel, and they have a hammered pork benedict that is unreal!!. . The portions are huge. The ingredients are great, they love rosemary.... The staff are always friendly.. . Usually it's very busy which is a healthy sign, but sometimes its too busy- can't blame them for that...
Love this place! Always fresh, hot food and fast, friendly service. You can't go wrong with most items on their menu. My favorites are the Tractor Combo and the Sage Chicken and Bacon-Infused Waffle. Yummy!
Good food and fast service. I enjoyed it.
All I can say is BREAKFAST IS DELICIOUS! Just be prepared to wait a while to be seated and for the food to come out.
The food itself was great. It was a late minute decision to come here due to the fact that my favorite restaurant was close on Sunday's. . . I ordered the chicken and waffles and ate 2/3 of it. The chicken was very moist to my surprise! And the waffles with bacon went well with the chicken. My friend ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict. She was nowhere close to finishing! . . Reasons for the two star deduction is basically customer service:. A) When we entered the young female in the front took a long time to figure out that there were customers waiting on her. And when we asked for an outside seating she said it will take 10 minutes. But her co-worker behind her says a table was ready for us. She seemed confused as we followed the guy to our outdoor seating. So communication on their part needs to be fixed. . . B) Our food came out in an orderly time (around 10 minutes) which wasn't bad for the humongous portions we were given. HOWEVER, the servers were sloppy when they handed us our plates. The First Lady brought in my friends plate first and clumsily lays it in front of her. As the plate dropped and the server turned, an orange slice slipped off the plate and landed on my friends lap. I've never seen anyone so careless in putting a plate down a table. . . Another different lady came in with my plate minutes after that and the presentation was just not pretty. The fried sage was literally hanging off the plate when I saw it coming. That's my biggest pet peeve because either they don't care about the way it looks (I doubt it since all of their food looks spectacular) or they are just overall clumsy. . . C) Lastly, the lack of customer interaction was just not there. I guess that's it's perks of being outside? After I got my check it took them a good 10 minutes to finally come back and check up on us. . . Even though my first experience here was rocky, I know I'll be back soon to hopefully redeem this great restaurant. Till next time.
Went here for the elaborate chicken and waffles, and granted I had a hangover...I still finished it all since it was so delicious!
1) Don't go when they have been open for less than 2 hours- your food will take forever.. 2) Know that all of the various gravies are to cover dry food.. 3) Feel free to order whatever you want because it all tastes the same.. 4) While 90% of your food will be served 3 degrees above room temperature, the bad gluey potato waste they call mashed potatoes will be scalding hot on the inside. I seriously think they use a microwave.
Probably the first cool foodie friendly joint in Vegas before it was the buzz word heard round the world.  Hash House has a couple locations in town and all have delivered consistently fantastic food and service.  The portions are gigantic, easily big enough for 2 people so maybe share a plate because there's no way you're leaving hungry.
The sage chicken Benedict was the best dish.  The portions were way too big for me. Overall good but I've tasted better. It's a breakfast version of Claim Jumpers. I don't see how anyone can finish the dish. Wanted to try the  watermelon lemondade but it was $5.50. Way too expensive!!!
2 words.... FUC*!NG Amazing!!! we had the Sage chicken Benedict and it was definitely more than enough for me and my wife. I also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy which was unbelievable but unecessary since we were not even close to finishing it since we were stuffed lol. The wait is kinda long but definitely worth the wait.  Hit up the bar inside while you wait. They have great hangover fixes.
Great food. You must come here really hungry. Huge servings. Great atmosphere......
I can't say anything bad about this place. The service, food and ambience are awesome. Some how they manage to get out a fresh meat loaf in 5-10 mins. It's just the best!
Hash House a Go Go is by far. my favorite lunch spot of all times (minus the wait). My last review isn't up to my personal standard soI definitely wanted to update with a more helpful/useful review! . . On my most recent visit to Vegas to see my Vegas Favs, the four of us came on a Saturday and the wait was only about 25-35minutes. Not too bad at all!! . . We were helped by Nick!! He was awesome!! I could tell that he was very busy with many other tables but he was still positive, cheerful, upbeat and attentive to our table. . . We ordered 2 Andy Sage Fried Chicken ($13.50/each) a Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) a Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack and another Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, sausage and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) an Apple Cinnamon Flapjack. For drinks we ordered 3 Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade ($5.50 each) and a Banana Latte ($5.99).. . My Andy Sage Fried Chicken was AMAZING!!!!!! The portions here are huge and I was able to each this for. multiple meals :D It is served with a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then two biscuits, tomatoes, bacon, the huge fried chicken, 2 scrambled eggs on top. And all of that loveliness and covered in their tasty special sauce. I highly recommend this item!! I think Man vs Food even featured this item of one of their episodes!!! . . My friends really enjoyed their Tractor Driver Combos but it was too HUGE!! They were only able to stuff down half  of their order, but the flapjacks aren't ideal to togo. I would recommend sharing this item if you order it :) . . You can't come here without trying their award winning Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade!!!!!!! It is refreshing, well balanced AND pretty for the camera. I think you can pay more and get a souvenir cup from Hash House if you order this beverage :) . . Good service, reasonable prices, LARGE portions and DELICIOUS food!!!!!! What more can I ask for?!?! :D
The scramble portion is way too SMALL, don't order.  Sent it back and ordered the biscuits and gravy and the mash potatoes burnt my throat.  Felt like they were beyond hot.  The over easy eggs had water in them.  I think they must of put boiling water in the mash potatoes for them to burn my mouth and the boiling water went into my eggs.  . . I really wanted to like this place, a friend referred me, but I ended up eating NOTHING.  I was afraid to order anything else.. . Come to find out, they were violated by the health dept for food temp.  http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php
Was uber excited to go to Hash House after being told by others how great it was. Still wondering what the great is. Service was good. Prices affordable. Food was not what we expected based on all the other reviews. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't "awe inspiring" either.
I came in this morning for the first time and ordered the crabcake hash breakfast plate special. What I received was a lukewarm crab cake that had no flavor, on a bed of what seem like six potatoes chopped up and browned, and a couple of eggs. First of all my son could've made those eggs and potatoes. There was no seasoning on them and nothing to them at all. When I ate the crabcake and got to the middle and found it to be cold, I asked my waiter for help. He was good enough to bring me another plate and that's what I was shocked. There was such a difference between the first place I was served and the second that it really turned me off. The crabcake was hot and even though it tasted basically the same it was freshly cooked. I can't figure out for the life of me why they would serve me that first plate, but I guess since I was by myself and sitting in the bar it wasn't any big deal. I don't have any idea if the other plates of food are better than what I got but I can tell you that I won't be back after this morning's experience.
Honestly didn't understand what all the fuse was about. Big portions yes, food was okay. Service on the other hand wasn't great. From the hostess to the servers. Sat outside and was ignored most of the time. Had to walk inside to pay for our food.
5 stars every time. . This is a favorite of our out of town relatives and I love taking people there. It's always busy, so don't go when you are at the point of hunger. The service is always good. The servers all seem to work together as a team and they seem to have a really well organized system. The food comes out fairly quickly once you order and people are always checking up on your drinks or whether or not you need something. I have been here more than a handful of times and even though it's not my thing to try different menu items at places I go to, I almost always do here because you almost can't go wrong. . Our favorites are. Sage chicken and waffles. Bacon waffle-personal favorite. Skillets and scrambles-you can't go wrong!. And don't forget to get a bite of someone's biscuit and fresh jam if yours doesn't come with one! . One thing to be said, while I see their pancakes are popular, I personally do not care for the very thick style pancakes. These pancakes are almost 3 times as thick as a regular pancake and about 4 times as large area wise. But again, that's more of a personal preference, not a negative review.
Seriously - how much better can it get than this for breakfast?  I guess if they served it to me at home in my pi's, that would be better, so aside from that actually happening, this is as good as it gets.  Every single thing my hubby and I ate was pure heaven!  We both ordered the specials - mine was a banana, brown sugar & pumpkin pancake.  Every bite was exquisite.  I was soooo happy while eating it!  My husband had something with scrambled eggs, mushrooms, tomato... whatever it was, it was delish and it came with a biscuit that was the best darn biscuit I've ever had.  When it appeared to our very attentive waitress that we weren't going to eat the biscuit, she brought over a peach preserve and butter.  Am I ever glad that she did!  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their menu!
Does it get much better or more filling when it comes to breakfast. After a few nights on the strip, this is how I choose to cap off my visit to vegas. The food is unbelievably good. The inventiveness of their dishes is not seen anywhere else I've been and they get it right every time. I recommend this place to anyone who asks where to go to eat in vegas. Love this place!!!!
The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). . . Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. . . It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. . . Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed and had to wait 10mins for a table. . The waitress seemed a bit stressed (due to possible understaffing) and barely got a moment of her time. I had ordered the blt bloody Mary, nothing too special and a bit spicy for my taste. The slice of bread that comes with it - awesome idea...if there were a few more slices of bacon to go with it! . I had ordered the fried chicken Benedict, my friend ordered the salmon scramble(I think). She had feared, after ordering, that what she'd ordered wouldn't be what's expected. As soon as the food came(ca. 15mins later), it wasn't what she'd expected and sent it back. Around 5mins. Later, her replacement meal was served. The kitchen was definitely on top of their game that day! . I enjoyed my benedict, buuuut there was just a little too much chipotle for my taste.
