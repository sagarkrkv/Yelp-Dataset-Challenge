Had the Route 81 burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had peppered bacon, carmelized onions and sharp cheddar cheese with BBQ sauce. . . Well, where do I start?  The bacon was old, black and hard as a rock; maybe yesterday's?  As for BBQ sauce, it was nearlynon existent; about a tablespoon or so. I ordered the burger medium; the waiter said it would come with "pink in the middle," it was well done like the bacon.   I couldn't even choke it all down. . . The sweet potato fries were great as was the Stone IPA I had. That's something.... . For all the hype this place has gotten, their food didn't deliver.
3 1/2 stars would be more like it, but I'm rounding up because some of it was that I wasn't feeling super spiffy.  Stopped in early on a recent Sunday morning when they first opened, but late enough that we couldn't get a booth and had to get one of their small two-tops.  (not overly comfy).. . Server Gal was fine.  Ordered Teas and our burgers (waffle fries for Husband).  Took awhile.  But when they arrived they were perfectly cooked.  (medium well as requested).  Still juicy.  Nice grill flavor.  Good bun.  My only criticism was I didn't detect any of the BLT sauce I had requested (which I had been told would come on the side anyway and it didn't seem to come anywhere).. . Husband liked his Shaft's Blue just fine.  Was it a jump-up-and-down Vegas dining experience? No. Was it a quite good one near where we needed to be at the time (Mirage hotel)?  Yes.
Stopped here for a quick lunch. I had a burger + onion rings. My S.O. had a salad.. They screwed up her salad order with dressing on the side and then took quite a while to correct it.. My burger and rings were average. Nothing special here.. . Cheers to all
Enjoyed the burger. Was Definitely a messy burger but had good taste. Their selection of fries was ok...we had the buffalo fries with blue cheese and it was just to overpowering. Service wasn't as good as I expected but a good place to eat if you don't want anything special.
Save your tastebuds!. . This review just goes to show that you should take other reviews to heart before trying a place.. . I ordered the classic burger with Swiss and a side of sweet potato fries. If it weren't for the fact that I was starving, I would have sent everything back.. . The burger was supposed to be medium and it was raw. The menu didn't say anything about the toppings so I had no clue there was raw onion on it. Ewwww! Talk about a rude awakening when taking the first bite.. . Now let's talk sweet potato fries from hell. They have to be from hell cause they weren't cooked - they were cremated and had a horrible ash aftertaste. Ugh! Can these cooks not see that burnt black is not a desired color for fries!
came in for a quick dinner last weekend (10/4/14) and left feeling scarred for life. . . my burger was nothing spectacular, but it was a long day and i wasn't going to complain.... . ...that was until i took a bite and bit down on something really hard. we immediately got the attention of our server and she brought it back to the kitchen. when she came back she informed us that it was a bone and that because they grind their own meat, bones sometimes gets into the burgers. WHAT THE F$@K!!! i bit down on a bone and she acted like it was no big deal.. . it happens sometimes?!! how the hell does that happen. that should never happen, ever. i'm so disgusted. my meal was comped, but the lack of concern is horrifying. i'm baffled that the manager didn't come out to apologize. . . ew
Very surprised to read some low reviews on here.  My buddy and I checked out BLT burger after Googling "best burgers in Vegas" while here for a conference.  He had gotten takeout the night before and loved it.. . The atmosphere is very cool as is the decor.  We each got burgers (blue cheese for me) and the spiked milkshakes.  WOW!  The fries were hand cut, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The burger was a beautiful medium and fresh off of the grill.  Admittedly I drank most of my shake before my food came out and I wish I could have put away another.  . . BLT Burger will be a 'must have' place every time I'm in Vegas now.  Great food!
Pretty surprised from the bad reviews. Every time im in Vegas i have to stop by blt burger. Easily the best buffalo wings in my life, really good fries, potato fire and onion rings. My burger was cooked to perfection. Decided to only give 4 stars because  had a bad experience with my last waiter but besides that Ive never been disappointed eating here and Ive been here at least 10 times. Ooh almost forgot to mention there deep fried oreos and other deserts are amazing also. Never tried the shakes yet, not a shake person
Adult milkshake-delish. Slider Trio- amazing.  Nachos- legit. Was stoked they were open late when the munchies hit. Service was mediocre but food made up for it.
If I could give this place zero stars I would.  We've eaten here a number of times as you can see that this is an updated review. the fact that the place was almost empty should have been our first clue.  Went with friends because the guys wanted burgers.  Server was prompt and brought drinks and took our order.  Since my friend and I didn't want burgers we opted for the salad special of the day - spinach steak salad.  Sounded good and it said there were tons of things in it.  The server asked how we wanted the meat cooked, medium rare and dressing on the side.  The meal came - the beef on the salads was so tough you couldn't eat it and it was cooked until it looked like shoe leather.  The server came by, we complained and she took the dishes back to the kitchen.  then nothing.  The men finished their burgers and we waited and waited and waited.  I finally asked for the manager after watching the server wander around doing nothing.  He came, we explained and he was almost snotty when he said well he'd take care of our bill and go find the missing salads.  He came right back so they must have been just sitting there.  The steak was still overcooked and tough and the salad had one cherry tomato cut in half and a pile of spinach.  It was horrible and neither my friend or I finished ours.  It was so bad that I actually complained to the hotel operations manager.  First, if you are going to advertise a salad as a special, make it special.  Second, if you have a problem then the server should have been standing at the shoulder of the chef making sure the dish was corrected and came out of the kitchen quickly.  There are lots of burger places on the strip, don't waste your time on this one.
The menu lists a $7 charge for upgrading any burger with soda and fries and when the bill comes $3.50 is listed separately as a soda and the other $3.50 is included in the burger line item. Confusing pricing scheme and mediocre food.
