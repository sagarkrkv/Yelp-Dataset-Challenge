food was really good, but portions were HUGE... too big.. also, overpriced, but everything on the Strip is.
Huge portions, great food & its 24 hours!!! I wish there was one these in Los Angeles. Only downside is that its always busy here. Waiting list is long. So make sure you have patience. It will pay off once you have your food. Best believe that.
Rave reviews!! The price,  the food, the BLT Mary all amazing. Huge portions of food for the price. Dishes can be easily split between 2 or 3 people.
I had absolutly awesom fried green tomatoe with chicken salad and grilled chicken with pumpkin and mashed potatoes, coverd with tomatoes. Food was amazing and we will come back for sure. Loved it.
I have been here 4 times. It is on top of my list of restaurants to visit whenever I visit Vegas. There is always a line, so expect to wait, but it is completely worth it! The service is great. They have a super friendly waitstaff who are really knowledgable about their menu and drinks. Every time I've been, I've only gotten breakfast, so I have no idea how their lunch or dinner is. Their food has huge portions, but every bite is delicious. I've had their pancakes, chicken and waffles, hash, eggs Benedict, and sampled many other dishes that the people I came with ordered. Everything was delicious. If you've never been, this is definitely one of the places you need to go! You won't regret it!
This place is pretty unusual and somewhat difficult to find using their own map on Yelp.  . . I was with two other guys for a convention and we thought we'd try this out at 11PM.  Service was good.  The food offerings were very good and breakfast appears to served all day.  . . I ordered the corned beef hash...it wasn't.  It was corned beef on top of chopped and fried potatos, a load of cheese and a rock hard biscuit.  It was tasty but no hash in the corned beef hash.  . . The overall experience was good or I would have to post a two star review.  I would love for someone in the restaruanting world to start with a menu of realistic portion-size expectations.  The portions were enormous and you have no idea you are getting so much food.
I love breakfast so naturally I figured there had to be a ton of amazing breakfast places on the Strip, right? Well if there is,  I couldn't find them! but i did stumble upon this gem and boy am I glad I did! Can I please bring you back to Pittsburgh? . . It was a little hard to find but only because of construction going on. The place is upstairs and has a really neat and interesting interior. We were seqted (both times we went) within 15 minutes! . . Both times I ordered the tractor driver breakfast which I got with eggs, a waffle, potatoes, and I got an extra side of sausage. This meal was huge and so filling! It also came out so fast I was shocked! Everything was cooked perfect and I highly recommend the sausage.  It basically melts in your mouth, so delicious! . . My boyfriend got the smashed pork tenderloin. OMG this was HUGE. it came out and the gentleman at the table next to ours asked to take a pic! I don't think I have ever seen a breakfast so big. My boyfriend loved it! . . Our entire experience both times was amazing. I told everyone that I knew in Vegas(we were there for a wedding) about it and most of them tried it and loved it. I am so happy I found this place and when Vegas calls again, you can find me there!
Excellent food with lots of flavor. I ordered the man vs food. OmG its soo good. Had to tag team.it with my son and we still got conquered we couldnt finish it. Servers and workers are friendly and nice. Be patience alot of people. Truat me itnia worth the wait. Enjoy....
Such a good place to visit while we were in Vegas! We came back here again and again because the food, service, atmosphere was perfect. Every time a waitress or waiter would walk by with a plate of food everyone would stare and ask the person who received it what they ordered. Every time something came out everyone was amazed! You know you're doing something right when everybody is surprised and  delighted every time. It's a must go if you're in Vegas!
Amazing! Had a 25 minute wait around 11 on a Monday, not too shabby! Fast and friendly service and for a breakfast food junkie like me, it was heaven. Huge portions and the biscuits are a gift from the gods.
What a fun and unique spot for a late night breakfast!  There is a ton of construction on the Quad in this area, so it can be a little confusing to find this upstairs eatery, but well worth it!  Be aware that the portions are HUGE!  In hindsight, definitely would have shared.    They also have a full bar, which is always a nice touch.  Our waitress was the sweetest and very patient, with one very intoxicated person in our group  Clearly, not her first rodeo!. . I ordered the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict (as seen on Man Vs. Food), it was a BEAST and SO SO delicious...seriously the size of a loaf of bread filled with eggs, sauce, potatoes and crispy chicken- unbelievable!  The interesting twists they put on traditional breakfast items, is worth the trip alone.  Prizes were reasonable considering it's a touristy area!
Good food, but very large portion sizes! Fun, casual atmosphere. I'd come here again for a casual breakfast.
Hash House A Go Go, a place to train if you want to get into competitive eating!. . My cousin and I decided to walk from our hotel to Hash House A Go Go. Since this place had a reputation of serving large portions, we had to build our appetites. It was about a twenty minute walk from Treasure Island in the triple digit heat of Vegas. No sauna suit needed!. . When we arrived, the waiting area was packed! Those who were waiting for a table made use of the mini-bar by the host stand. The mini-bar served their famous bloody marys and screwdrivers, for a price. As I went to put my name down for a table, the wait was estimated for a thirty to forty-five minute wait. Since we were famished, we were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.. . Once we sat at the bar our server/bar tender, Jeanette, assisted us. She took our drink orders and I chose to get a screwdriver. After placing our drink orders, we started browsing through our menus. Everything looked good on the menu, but due to stomach limitations, we ordered the following:. . - Sage chicken and waffles that include, Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks. . - Farm benedict with hammered crispy pork tenderloin with market yellow tomato, spinach, bbq cream and topped with scrambled eggs.. . The screwdriver was pretty strong for my empty stomach and gave me a light buzz. As our food was brought to us, the medley of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", was playing in my head. These portions were ginormous! To make sure we experienced the best dining experience at Hash House A Go Go, we switched off on eating our dishes. The tenderloin and fried chicken were both crispy. The waffles with the fried chicken were kind of soggy due to the oil of the fried chicken. The gravy, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuits were a great blend of must have breakfast items.. . These monstrosities destroyed our hunger pangs! The service from our server/bar tender Jeanette was great! My first time here was a great experience.
Over-rated as 'best breakfast place in Las Vegas'. We arrived around 10:30 on a Monday to find a line of about 8 to 12 people. The line moved quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes.. . As per other reviews, portions are very large. After looking at the menus (and a few pics on Yelp) I ordered the sage chicken, eggs and mashed potatoes. My friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash. Overall service was good, attentive and prompt. Environment is unique with checkered chrome metal on the walls and comfortable booths. . . I didn't taste hers so all I can say is she liked it. Nice large strips of corned beef hash over potatoes with some gravy. She ordered hot tea and it came in a rather unique tea bag. . . I ordered the Andys Sage Chicken, Eggs and Mashed Potatoes along with coffee. The chicken is breaded and deep fried. Mashed potatoes have bacon in them. Eggs were over easy and there was also two strips of bacon. The eggs were a bit overcooked but still slightly runny. The chicken left a lot to be desired, tasteless and bland. The breading added nothing to the flavor and was too thick for my preference. Bacon also wasn't very tasty. The mashed potatoes were ok but there's a lot. There was a raspberry drizzle around the outside of the plate that proceeded to make everything I touched sticky. Not a big fan.. . Overall I'd call it a disappointing visit from my perspective. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles but wasn't a big fan of how it was presented after looking at the pics on Yelp.
Huge portions , great food and ambiance!!!!
Delicious food. Portions are huge so it doesn't hurt to share. Had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Eggs. Excellent.
Amazing food. We went for lunch on Monday and had to wait about 45 minutes. Once seated the atmosphere was really fun. Retro farmhouse . Our waitress was nice and gave great service. I highly recommend sharing an entree because they are enormous portions . We got a burger with mashed potatoes and bacon in the middle of 2 1/4 lb patties. The burger had excellent flavor and the fries were super crispy . We also got a side of fried chicken which was a filleted chicken breast and the breaking had excellent flavor and was done to perfection .
Great breakfast spot!!! Went with a few girls and everyone loved what they ordered.    I tried the Chicken & Waffles at the suggestion of our cab driver, concierge and hostess.... it was great!!!!  Apple Juice was freshly squeezed and divine. I will definitely return on my next visit.  Oh and our waiter was most helpful with the menu.  Try it!
We went here on a Friday morning. Had about a 20 minute wait, which was not bad, considering how packed it was. Our food was excellent. Would probably split it next time. We all had pancakes. It was the size of a medium pizza. Service was good. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the noise level in the dining room was VERY loud. We could barely hear each other talk. We will go back again on our next trip for sure!
Simply the greatest bowl of Steel-cut Oats I've ever had. Don't feel the need to get a side of eggs and toast, Hash House Steel-cut oats will get the job done. Fun servers, but try to get seated before 9, the line gets a little crazy.
I love their service and my favorite is the chicken and waffle.  Big portion, it can fill up two grown adults.
No stars for Hash A Go Go.  We waited over 45 minutes for frozen sunny side eggs.  We asked for a new order only to be served more frozen sunny side eggs.  Avoid if Salmonella is not your thing.
This is the best breakfast spot on the strip!  The potions are HUGE. I'm a big eater and my wife and I could share the chicken and waffles. Biscuits and gravy is good too.  We had a large party, but the service great.  We know that large parties can be difficult to please.  Scott ( young red head guy) was EXCELLENT! He even checked on us the next day even though we weren't sitting in his section.  If you come to Vegas you have to eat here!
Service was good, coffee was great. But why did I only give it 3 stars??? food was just average ol breakfast food. Anything special about that average ol breakfast? They put a partial branch of rosemary in ur biscuit for garnishment. Thats it.... . . Please note the food wasn't horrible.... it was edible but just very plain... nothing to get that excited about. If you are really hungry... prob not worth the wait time. Had higher expectations for as much hype as this place gets.
Yum! We had this on our last breakfast before we headed out of town. What a stop! Plate sized pancakes. Mashed potatoes for breakfast! We sat at the bar and had a great meal!! We did valet and we were in and out. A definite must on our next trip!
We were seated fairly quickly. Took a while to get the speciality coffees we ordered. Mine came just warm asked to make it hotter, came back and burnt my throat. Should have seen the writing on the wall. I would like to say I'm a foodie I like unique and different flavours but this was not enjoyable.  We ordered one plate the wait staff let us know a couple of times the portions were very large.  I personally found it way to much, would prefer regular portions, average prices and both try a dish instead of feeling we needed to share not to waste.  We ordered the HH original Benedict. To be fare the waitress warned the sauce had a red bell pepper taste.  The menus says red pepper cream sauce. What we got was pureed red peppers over eggs and raw spinach on a biscuit with mashed potatoes underneath.  Hated, hated every bit of this, my spouse ate it but not thrilled.  I wasn't the only one the two ladies acrossfrom us ordered the same pushed it aside and ordered a second plate of pancakes which she ate about 1/8 of it. She agreed it wasn't enjoyable also, so I don't think I'm so unusual. Be aware no "regular items here" read the menus carefully before making the trip to eat here.
Went here with a couple friends after hearing rave reviewsfrom a few sources. I got the #1 scramble and my friends got a buttermilkl pancake and the sage chicken and waffles.  None of us were happy with our food.  The scramble came with fried potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  The potatoes were cooked well but, like most of the food we received, was bland.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and had no butter, gravy, or even jam. The scramble itself was quite runny wich was very odd and still fairly bland.  . My friend's waffles had bacon in then and were OK. The fried chicken however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it. Had no flavor beyond that. . The pancake my other friend got was just a big pancake. Nothing special.  The portions were large or average with bare minimal to no condiments (butter, jam, maple syrup).. I do not recommend this place and will not be returning.
I agree with other yelpers that this place is overhyped. I liked the big portions because it allowed us to share, but the flavor was lacking and over powering at the same time. Our server was great, but our food was not. My brother and I split the roasted chicken hash and man, was the rosemary super strong! I like rosemary, but it tasted almost bitter. The potatoes were nice and crispy and the biscuit was tasty though. The famous chicken and waffles was disappointing. The presentation was awesome and looked promising, but the chicken was tasteless. The waffles were ok. All in all, it was just ok and we waited a long time.
Good food.  Huge portions but split the food. Music is to loud.. We were with another couple & they received their food first. We had to wait 20 minutes for our food.
The sage chicken and waffles was on point.  Haven't had anything like that before. The service was just as great as the food.  I had fried green tomatoes for an app, that too was great. It was paired with a watermelon. Sounds weird but it worked perfect.  I'm very impressed by this place. I'll be back again if I visit Las Vegas.
Ordered the corned beef with eggs over easy. Eggs were over medium (yolk hard).. It could be my misunderstanding, but the beef was stringy not like a "hash".. Coffee was ok, nothing special.. . The waiter was attentive and made coffee was filled
I was not impressed. I was with a group of five. It took thirty minutes for one order to come out and forty minutes to get a small side salad. Then three of us had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food while our other friend ate. The table next to us was having the same problem. When we asked the server who brought out the salad where our food was he told us it was not problem and to tell someone else. After the long wait I got a chicken sandwich that was over cooked and the bun was to hard to eat. I will not be coming back here.
When we arrived, the waiting area was packed! The wait was estimated for a 15-20 so the men decided to grab a bloody Mary and us ladies took a few pics and next thing you know we were being seated. . . Once we sat down our server came over immediately and took our drink orders and I chose to get one of the specialty drinks that came in a neat souvenir glass. Everyone had pretty much decided what was being order and from then it was on!. . - Sage chicken and waffles that include, Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks -AWESOME SAUCE. . -Corned Beef, red onions and Swiss cheese  -AWESOME SAUCE. . -Griddled HH meatloaf & 2 eggs served with mashed potatoes, fruit & biscuit - Now of course my husband had to be different and go against the grain and order this and he  was disappointed but he is lucky I love him so I shared my chicken and waffles and hash with him (yes I order both, I mean you only live once right). . The portions were huge and it took us the rest of the trip to finish it! . . This has been added to my favorite places to eat in Vegas.
Huge huge huge portions!  There were 10 of us the came here for lunch.    Seated us fairly quickly. All of us got different things and the portions were all big enough for three of me. My wife and I had the 24 ounce bloody Mary's called the BLT bloody with bacon lettuce tomato and a piece of toast. Tasty but not fantastic. I got the pork tenderloin with eggs Benedict on top of it covered the entire plate. Again it was good but not fantastic. Service was really good and fast. Next time we're definitely getting stuff to share.
Amazing!! Only waited 10 minutes on a Thursday morning around 10am.  I had the man vs food chicken breast eggs Benedict and husband had roasted chicken hash.  Good price, awesome food, awesome service, and huge portions.
Bloody Mary's are really really good. I had the corned beef hash. I would probably get the chorizo one. That one was better because of the chorizo flavoring! Bacon waffle is awesome.
Now that's ALOT of FOOD! Hope you're hungry. Anything you order is excellent! I always get the banana French toast, it is VERY good! Also the hot chocolate is excellent, come with 4 jumbo marshmallows in the cup to give you an idea of how large it will be. :) Everything is YUM!
Party of 9, high expectations. . . The good: . Large portions. Good coffee drinks. Chicken and waffles. Mashed potatoes. . The bad:. Bloody Mary's. Eggs Benedict (Man vs Food). Mimosa (light on champagne. Hash Special - too complicated. Price - Overpriced. . The average:. Service. Ambiance . . . . End result - Two very rowdy bellies.
Long wait & a little difficult to find but worth it. Large portion size, great service and the food taste amazing.
Hash House A Go Go is definitely a new favorite of mine. We stopped by for dinner before our evening outings. The place was only at 50% capacity,  but for some reason as a table of 7 we were forced to wait 15 minutes. . . Our server was very cheery and helpful but service overall was quite slow. He would linger for too long when we didn't need him, yet completely disappear when we required something. Very annoying. . Service: D+ (-1 star for that). . I ordered the Tractor Driver combo: two eggs + sausage accompanied by one gigantic pancake. Opted for the brown sugar banana flappy for an extra $1. Eggs and sausage were nothing special, but that pancake was absolutely insane. 1.5 feet in diameter with at-least two bananas inside! Tasty but overall too sweet, and too much of it; like trying to eat bananas foster alone for dinner. I barely ate half of the pancake. . . Thankfully the girlfriend's [chicken] breast was the perfect savory item to balance my sweets. Delicious with yet again very generous portions. I'd be tempted to order this next time. . . Others ordered the chicken pot pie and meat loaf: only good things to say about them. Even the kid's cheeseburger looked decent and large enough to satisfy the average adult. Everything was reasonable priced as well. Most items were $12-$20. Very impressed. . Food: A-. . **Tips. -Don't be the fool that fills up on those delectable honey biscuits. . -If your name isn't Takeru Kobayashi, you're not going to finish your food. Don't try to be a hero, son. . -Not in the mood to devour a small animal? You better split something. . . Definitely A Go Go for me!
Pretty large portion size for a reasonable price. May want to share with someone. The food is your typical brunch foods like chicken and waffles, pancakes, sanwiches, biscuit gravy type of deal. The wait can be long. Also there is no phone reception so if you are waiting and are trying to reach the rest of your party that is gambling good luck with that because they won't seat you until your whole party is present.  Overall this place is ok, there are so many more grand options in vegas for brunch why limit yourself eating here?!
Oh my goodness the food was really good. I got the chicken and waffles that order was enough to feed two. The chicken was crispy and seasoned. The waffles were fluffy and yummy. Oh and the strawberry kiwi drink was great even the large piece of watermelon was sweet.  We won't talk about the wait but it was worth it.
YUM! Hash House A Go Go is definitely worth waiting for!! Even though there is always a giant line, we are always seated in a decent time frame (once for just two of us, which is much easier, but the second time with seven of us - which I considered a miracle that we were seated in just over a half hour). . . HUGE HUGE portions. My husband and I split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and still didn't finish it!! I even had to leave mashed potatoes, my favorite thing on earth, on the plate because there was no more I could do without exploding! Everything on the plate was giant but still super tasty and well made. I feel like places with huge portions always have middling food, but Hash House definitely doesn't compromise flavor for size!! . . My husband got a crazy overflowing giant coffee drink. It was good, but I preferred my grapefruit mimosa. They have lots of different juices you can order for your mimosa, so that is definitely a plus! One of our friends was concerned that his breakfast only came with one pancake... once it came out he was concerned that his breakfast came with a WHOLE PANCAKE. Those things are not only giant, but thick and super filling (I don't think he made it through even half of it!). The pumpkin pancake that another friend got was AMAZING! So delicious. . . Definitely make time for this breakfast. It is great if you are hungover, and if you aren't, you can order a drink while waiting. If you can split with someone, though, I highly recommend it - for your own safety!
Yum!! Heard about this place on the Food Network and had to try it. I was not disappointed.  We arrived around 11 and the place was crowded as expected and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a party of 4. But 10 minutes later we were seated to my surprise. Every dish that went past us looked so good. We started with Bloody Marys and Mimosas which was good. Although the Blood Mary is very spicy so if you are sensitive to heavy pepper than this might not be the one for you.. . I had the Indiana Favorites Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and eggs and it was as good as it looked. The mashed potatoes and biscuit were good and eggs were cooked perfect over medium. Huge portions are big enough to share or eat half and take the other half for later. My son had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and he said it was awesome. He doesn't normally eat spinach but he ate the spinach in this dish because the food was so good. This was the definitely the best meal we had this trip.
Pretty great food. I can see being a local, getting one meal here and taking home enough for at least one more meal. My pumpkin pancake was wonderful. It took up the entire plate. I ate about half of it. The chicken Benedict dish with the chipotle sauce was great, the sauce tasted bland at first then just a minor bit of heat followed and made it really nice. All the food was great. Service was hit and miss. Like any big place you have multiple workers coming to your table. We also saw other workers who were really personable. The server for our table was at times testy, maybe is the best word. At times he was really good, at other times he acted like he couldn't be bothered. All and all very glad we went here. . My best advice? Bring lots of people and order 1/2 that number of meals.
Went to the one in Vegas at like 4 AM and had really high expectations for this place. I prefer breakfast food over lunch food so I was really excited to try it especially with it being featured on the Food Network. My friend and I split the corned beef hash and it came out and wasn't what I imagined corned beef hash to be! There were chunks of meat instead of slices of meat and it didn't look appetizing at all. It also didn't taste good! The portion is huge so maybe that's why a lot of people really like it. . . Would never go back here again.
A must visit while in town. BEWARE The portions are huge! Make a reservation! We order andys chicken and it was more food then the two of us could eat. There was so much food and it was so good. I wish i ate there everyday. Ps the pancakes are massive, falling off the plate huge.
There isn't a bad thing to say about this place. The place was packed and the wait was only 30 minutes which is great, and the service was fantastic. We shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and still couldn't finish it. The portions are huge and price is fantastic. It's a must try! I will be back!
Went here late night going for some good eats, but was very disappointed to find out that they only have 1/4 of their menu available. Everything was super unhealthy but my fiance and I ordered the 2 healthiest items we could find. Unfortunately, the salad was horrible, poor quality lettuce, excessive cheese, funky tasting turkey. My boyfriend ordered their basic breakfast with egg whites, which was good but how could you mess that up!?... needless to say, I won't be going back.. . Giving them 2 stars for having a delicious biscuit and good service.
Pancakes were good and breakfast bacon was on point. Service was great. Long line for breakfast, however the line moves relativly fast. Hotel was under construction and no clear signs on where to go but that is not the fault of the restaurant. other than that GR8 Place to get your vittles.
Food was amazing!. Portions were ridiculously huge and our waitress was probably the nicest person I've ever encountered! . It was pretty pricy but the portions are so large you can definitely split a plate.
We got two recommendations to go here so we schlepped over our last night in Vegas. The hubs HAD TO HAVE the BLT Bloody Mary, which he reported as being delightful.. This place is perfect if you have no feelings of guilt that children are starving in other areas of the world and PERFECT if you want to get so full that you hate yourself. Unfortunately I felt super guilty about the amount of food left on the plates and the cost of the meal.
Food was awesome.Your can purchase drinks while you wait.   Bloody Mary's were tasty.   One we sat down.. the waiter came right away.   After we ordered. . We didn't expect so much food. . Portions were huge. . Well worth the money.
Ewww found three fingernails in my eggs. When I asked for a new plate they acted like I was completely unreasonable. Do you even know how to breakfast? Insanity.
I enjoy eating their fried chicken and waffles! plates are served in big portions and they have  great customer service. this place never disappoints me!
First let me say that I love that his location serves brunch until 5pm! I wake up at like 2pm so this was hugely convenient to me.. . One of my best friends tells me all the time how good this place is and I'm happy to say I agree. The portion was much more than I needed but it was all so delicious I nearly ate all of it. The eggs were perfect, the crispy potatoes were great (they aren't hash browns. The waitress told us they don't carry hash browns), the biscuit was huge and they did give me strawberry jam so I don't know what the person below means about no jelly. . . The only problem we encountered why my boyfriend's bacon was a little dry but as soon as he told the waitress, she came right back out with new bacon and he said it was perfect. . . Speaking of the waitress, she was wonderful. i believe her name was Heather if the management happens to read this. She answered  my questions and explained everything in great detail so I really knew what my options were. She had a great demeanor and was probably the best waitress/waiter I had in Vegas. . . I will definitely be returning on my next trip. And being 24 hours is a huge plus!
Great presentation and service. Overall a fun location. I'm sad to say that the hammered pork sandwich was very bland. Not bad, just flavorless. How something that looks so amazing/intimidating can taste like nothing is beyond me, but the only distinct flavors were the pickles and ketchup. I guess that's what I get for ordering something with "Indiana" in the name! Prices are right and I did have a good time. I would consider going back for some late night short-order breakfast.
Not too bad, but not amazing. We came here early on a Friday and waited for a while to get a seat. We ordered Andy's sage fried chicken and the veggie hash. . . Andy's fried chicken: The sauce was pretty tasty, but it was mostly cream. It was some kind of hollandaise sauce. I liked this better than the hash. Chicken and biscuits tasted good. Overall, I'd probably order this again. The portion is also humongous and can be shared between 3-4 people, so it's a pretty good deal for the price. . . Veggie hash: pretty bad. The potatoes were soggy and the seasoning was subpar. Don't be fooled that you'll get a crispy hashbrown-like dish. The potatoes are in cubes. . . Overall, I don't mind giving this place another shot or coming here with friends if we want breakfast or late nightdinner on the strip. It's a better choice than I-HOP or Denny's.
HUGE PORTIONS!!!. . Long lines! Surprising since it is inside Imperial Palace, now the Quad. Service was good.. . House Hash Roasted Chicken - $12.95 - Chicken was a bit dry and under seasoned. Veggies were cooked decent. Potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. Biscuit was fluffy.  . . House Hash Corned Beef - $12.95 - Beef was good but could have been griddled more crispy. Cheese on top was melty. Potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. Biscuit was fluffy.  . . Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles - $14.95 - Chicken was nice and crispy. Waffles have bacon cooked inside of them which was different and yummy. Needs a ton of maple sauce cause it gets to become dry really quick. . . Overall the food is typical huge brunch dishes that are cooked decently but are bland.
