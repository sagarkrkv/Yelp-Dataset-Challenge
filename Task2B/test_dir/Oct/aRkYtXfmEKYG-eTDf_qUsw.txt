I really enjoyed this place when it was a smaller coffee shop.  Now it has grown too crowded and the lines are too long.  I primarily drink black coffee, so imagine my surprise when after waiting in line for awhile they put my cup in line after all the other specialty drinks.  Just too much time for a quick cup of coffee.
My favorite place in Phoenix!!. . I love the decor, ambience, music, the food, bakery, and hibiscus tea (free refills!). . The staff is amazing, especially Sammy/Sammie. He will give you GREAT recommendations on other places to go in Phoenix! . . They also have a full bar that I have yet to try, but this is really a cool place to hang out solo, with your boo-thang, or group. I've even seen people with kids here; 3-year-olds vibe-ing to A Tribe Called Quest.. . Don't miss out!!
Great coffee, I recommend the excellent Yorkshire pudding burger that is steady on a daily changing evening menu.  Cool atmosphere (multiple rooms with tables/chairs) with free wifi - when you need to spend some time doing research or work.  I've been able to catch parts of a game on the large screen room (just a plus).  Its usually crowded with a never ending amazing mix of people - so if you like to be "alone" - maybe not your place.  An unusual mix of music - which I enjoy.  Nice outdoor seating as well.  Parking can be limited, though can park down the street.
-UPDATED- . . Great coffee, nice place (call it "hipster" if you want...stupid, made up word...) and an EPIC breakfast sandwich. The egg sandwich is expertly done. Can't wait to go back.. . Updated 12/4/14: This has since become my spot. Every Wed or Thursday I go in and get breakfast. Sandwich and iced coffee is the routine. Love it! . . I missed breakfast today though so gave their pulled pork sandwich a whirl. SO good! Can't recommend this place highly enough.
This is such a cute and hipster coffee spot in Phoenix! I love that it's open very late and also offers food and drinks (alcohol included). . . I think the only thing that is a little harder is that it is somewhat difficult to find because the entrance is on the back side, not facing the street, and it looks like you're going nowhere because the street side looks closed, and also looks like you're going into the restaurant next door.. . Once inside though, it's cute, but a little dungeon-ish. Not too much natural light in this concrete cave of a building. Their americano is pretty bomb, I haven't had any of the lattes but people seem to like their tea based drinks here. . . They also sell roasted beans, and the staff is very knowledgable of all of their products. Recommended!
Love Lux! The best coffee Ever. The wine is amazing and the Mac n cheese is so tummy. Great atmosphere and lots of areas for large groups. I love Jeff and everyone at Lux.
Lovely atmosphere, creative space to study, food and coffee. What more do you need to keep your mind alert and in joyful spirit?!
Went for the first time on a Sunday and enjoyed my late and cinnamon roll with my wife. Unfortunately the place is very popular and crowded and the typical hipster vibe is there, but not unexpected.
When I visit a new city, the first thing I try to find is the city's perfect coffeeshop! I think Lux takes it for Phoenix. . . Casual, hip, & trendy atmosphere. Their decor was a mix of simple, modern with a vintage twist, I loved it! The workers were very outgoing and friendly which is always a big plus. It was hard to find seats because it was super packed but I'm not complaining.. . The noise level was pretty loud so I didn't understand how people were studying here. It seems more like a place for social outings. All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Lux.
Stopped here to pick up a gift card and a coffee on my lunch break and I have to say, I was majorly (and pleasantly) surprised! . . It's a coffee bar. Like literally a coffee shop WITH a full bar. Ample seating/ lounge space, unique and comfortable decor, welcoming staff and quick service. . . Yes, Lux appears to be a trendy haven for hipsters and pretentious d-bags...but that couldn't be further from the truth. The crowd is a mixed bag of students, working professionals, old yogis and kids. (All of which I saw within my 10 minute visit). The only negative part of my experience was leaving to go back to work. . . Most important: The coffee is good and refills are free.
Love this place. My friend recommended me this place and I loved it from the first step inside. Food is awesome. Environment cozy and easygoing. Super!
Black and white mocha is the best. It can get super busy though so late mornings are hard to find a spot and there is a line but it is WELL worth it
My buddy turned me on to this place, and I'm so glad he did. I have no complaints at all... I like everything and anything about this place. Pastries, coffee, and it's a next to Pane Bianco  Ooooooo!
This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.. . I liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.
I absolutely love this coffee shop. It's great for getting pastries, speciality coffee, and healthy lunches. . . There are also a lot of people that come here to work so if you'd like a lively environment, you should definitely bring your laptop. . . They have a bartender that will make speciality cocktails based on what you like. I have never tried it, but my friends tell me that they do a good job.. . Really recommend their chai and soy cappuchino. Way better than Starbucks.
Amazing!! Uber cute. Hipster shabby chic. Great mellow background music. Good energy. Wonderful service and staff. I got the maple granola yogurt for breakfast with a latte almond milk. They serve it in a cup white cup with a heart shaped design milk pour. Then I order to go the lemon donut , blueberry scone, and brioche. Yum!! Warm and made fresh with lots of flavors. This is a must stop place. Bring your friends. Great place!!
As a chai tea addict I had to try the coffee joint all the hipsters are raving about. I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed with a line out the door and every seat in the rather large building taken. After waiting some time I got my chai tea and I was good. Not the best I've ever had but I would go back and enjoy another. The atmosphere was nice and it was a new experience for a relaxed Saturday night.
I ate here twice while on business in Phoenix. Why just go to Starbucks when you can visit a local place? The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back... the first time I went with my co-worker we were greeted with "what's up, guys?" It's a cool place. I had an Americano both times and it was excellent. We also indulged in a different quiche each day we visited and both were the absolute best we'd had. SO GOOD. . . If I had to give any points of feedback, I'd say make the order/pickup process a little more structured and clear to patrons. It tends to get busy and there's a clear lack of instructions (oh, hipsters) from the cashiers. I'm all for laid back but not when it causes chaos.. . Overall, it's a great place and I would come here again!
What a cool, swanky little place. From the surprisingly high end good to the mixologist liquor bar. This is a wonderful place whether you need a coffee shops to study, meet a friend or have a wonderful first date. Talk to Sam at the bar. Great server who will never leave you hangin'.
I went to this place last month with my best friend and the food was good I love the coffee designs  and the service was friendly.
Definitely my favorite coffee shop in the Central Phoenix area. By golly, they even offer dutch pancakes (please allow 25 - 30 mins for this)... wow!! It's pretty fantastic! My drink is deifinitely a hot Black and White which is a mocha with dark and white chocolate... great balance between the bitterness of the dark and sweetness of the white chocolate. . . Plenty of parking and seating. I never realized that they actually have a full bar. I may never leave this place.
