It has lost its Michelin Star rating. But.. I may be the last person on earth who's not eaten at a Bobby Flay's joint. I'm ambivalent about celebrity chefs as a whole but some are really good: Thomas Keller and Marcus Samuelsson come to mind.. . Food is surprisingly good. Blue corn pancake and shrimp to start. Rabbit on green pea cous cous blew my mind. It was really phenomenal. Rib eye was super yummy. Fish was decent.. . It's a lot less expensive than Masa or Robuchon.  It's got great service. The spiciness was just right, subtle but carries punch. . . This is what I think about celebrity chef restaurants. Some can be very good (Red Rooster in Harlem), and some can be impressively bad (Paula Deen's the Lady and Sons in Savannah), but most of them are going to be somewhere in between. . . What's unusual about Mesa grill is that it's quite a different type of southwestern restaurant. The side corn reminded me of Mac and Cheese. Bobby Flay took something ordinary and made them into extraordinary. Few people can get rabbit right. He did. This restaurant did.. . Seeking a mid price range restaurant in the casino that guarantees a full basket of carbs shortly after you order, and serves up 22 oz rib eye to curb your steak craving? Seek no longer.
Does not disappoint! It's a grill with a kick! Tiger shrimp is succulent and tamale side buttery, moist, sweet corn. The cheese appetizer is also delicious. Both the pork tenderloin and ribeye are top-notch, spicy, sweet, perfectly seared. The buttery sweet potato tamale with pecans is awesome! Better than the side of blue corn basil tamale. Even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese, walnut raisin, blue cornbread... Yummy. We had some chocolate pudding that was delicious, creamy milk chocolatey. Service is friendly, helpful and responsive. My son loves the cheese quesadillas they will make for kids. My baby was grunting in delight for spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes - I think she had 1/2 of my husband's side to herself!
Wish I had something good to say about the food, but we never actually had the opportunity to eat. Ten minutes of fire alarms and flashing lights in the middle of dinner service kind of killed it for our party. We just couldn't take it any longer.
Ok, I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay so my wife and decided to drop by Mesa Grill. We shared the 22 ounce steak with mashed potatoes. I have to be honest and admit that I really wasn't that impressed with the food. The steak was good but NOT what I expected with all the hype that comes with Bobby. I seriously thought I would get blown away by the food but his steak tasted pretty much like any other steak you could buy at Longhorn steak house. As for the mashed potatoes well, they taste like all mashed potatoes should taste like.  Overall I would give him a 6.5 out of 10 for his steak but I am not sure I would spend $65.00 again for only steak and mashed potatoes.
Food was different but good.  Had the pork tenderloin and queso potatoes which were great. Chopped salad was just ok, my wifes poblano pepper blah and her corn was good but a little heavy on the lime.  Overall good but can't see the value in the meal overall.
Delicious appetizers! Try the ahi nachos with mango habenero dressing.  Additionally, their pumpkin soup is KILLER! Love me some Bobby Flay.
This was my family's splurge meal on our Vegas vacation.  Since the wife has some kind of crush on Bobby Flay, we decided on lunch at the Mesa Grill.  We made reservations the night prior, but it wasn't packed so we didn't really need to.  Nice decor, located inside the casino.  Service was friendly and efficient but not in-your-face.  1.  The bread - yeah, it's all that.  2.  The margaritas - ordered two white peach margaritas, and yeah, it's all that - unfortunately for my cheap ass, they were $14 each so I didn't get another one although I wanted to.  3.  My kids shared an appetizer for an entree, and of course we tasted it.  They had the chicken and black bean quesadilla, and they scarfed it up.  But it was pretty small.  We also ordered the blue corn pancake and barbequed duck, and it was fantastic...but so small.  I had the grilled shrimp tacos and the wife had spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.  Everything was so damn delicious.  Perfect amount of spice and heat.  But alas, the portions were small as well (maybe I'm just too fat).  So we ordered dessert - toasted coconut cake and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  Again, absolutely delicious, and the portions were more "normal."  The meal came out to $123 before taxes, which to me was worth it.  Regarding dress code - I had on shorts and a Charlie Sheen button shirt, and the wife had capris and super casual sandals.  I saw others with t-shirts and shorts, so if there is a code it's pretty lax, at least at lunch.
I used to like Mesa Grill and I think Bobby Flay is an excellent Chef. But this place as gone to the dogs. Expensive for lousy food. Nuked fish with a harsh rub. A salad made with five cents worth of food for eighteen bucks. Service that disappears if you have a comment that is not what they want to hear. Bobby Flay needs to get in there and raise some hell...the quality is crap. Any Michelin should be a tire mark. Substitutions of fish types without telling the customer. Will never go back.
I've been here a few times this place never fails! The first time we went my uncle got the rib-eye and it blew me away..so tender and juicy and it does come with thetwo sauces but the meat alone if just so good!!! That's what I order now everytime we eat here. We also tried the filet mignon which I was a bit skeptical at first because of the "coffee crusted" part but for some reason it works. Haha! The mashed potatoes with the creamy sauce in the middle is delicious and so is the tamale that goes as a side. The mango crusted tuna was good too if you're not a red-meat lover. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the pork. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and all the waters each time we have gone have been kind and knowledgable.  A bit pricey but worth it!
Althought Mesa Grill has been around for awhile, it has recently become one of my new favortie places to hit when I am on the Strip.  Had lunch there a few weeks ago and it was a treat.  Dinner last night was amazing with Lobster Tacos to start and a perfectly cooked NY strip that left me wanting more.  Presentation was lovely. Crowded scene!
Several years ago I went to the Mesa Grill for Lunch. It was OK, but nothing special. I went again the other day for Dinner and was blown away. We were shown to our table by the very courteous staff. Then our server came over and answered all the questions we had about the menu. We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.. . As an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before. The meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce complemented it very well and gave it more depth. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with a Green Chile Queso sauce. This was tasty as well and complemented the pork very nicely. My wife had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chop and loved it.. . For desert my wife and I shared the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. This was a little slice of heaven. The coconut was a nice brown and not heavily caked on the outside. It was just lightly applied. The cake to frosting ratio was nice. There were four layers of cake and the total frosting was about the same as one of the layers. It was nice and thin.. . We both enjoyed ourselves very much. I know we will be going back again.
Great food at this place! Bobby Flay is amazing and the menu here is excellent! Delicious food and drinks- especially their margaritas! I highly reccmmend the shrimp and corn tamale! It is considered an appetizer but i order it as my meal. Their burgers are great too. I have also eaten at the mesa grill in tbe atlantis and in Nyc and  they were excellent too! You cant go wrong eating here!
I didn't think I would enjoy this restaurant (I'm not a big Bobby Flay's fan), but I was surprised by the food.  It was quite good and the price was reasonable for lunch.  The bread basket was good, and I would recommend getting the cactus pear tea (unlimited refill).
I was more than excited about our reservations at Mesa Grill and the excitement turned out to be well worth it. From the drinks to the appetizers to the main courses- everything was delicious and impressive. The goat cheese fundido appetizer was to.die.for and the chilaquiles (that I ordered as my main course) were some of the best Ive ever had (and I like to think of myself as a chilaquiles connoisseur; its one of my favorite brunch items and Ive had them all over California, in Chicago, Austin, and now Las Vegas).. . Im not really one to drink margaritas (they're much too sweet and they typically contain crappy ingredients), but Mesa Grill's "skinny" margarita (the Partida Margarita) was delicious and, thankfully, not overly sweet since in was only sweetened with agave nectar instead of simple syrup or plain sugar or other questionable sweeteners. . . Overall: I would highly recommend dining at Mesa Grill if you have the chance. Great service, wonderful food, impressive margaritas, and conveniently located at Caesar's Palace.
Our first time dining at  a Bobby Flay restaurant and I must say the food was quite delicious. For starters we had the blue corn pancake with barbecue duck and the tiger shrimp with a garlic corn tamale. The tiger shrimp and the tamale was very delicious, so many different flavors in on little tamale. I found the pancake and duck however to be quite sweet, not one of my favorites. For our main course my wife and i shared the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, which was splendid as well. Definitely one of the tastier restaurants I've been to in vegas.
Yeay for putting a twist on Mexican/Southern food. . And for not having long lines and instant seating.. And having mango-carrot juice on your menu, Bobby Flay.. . We originally intended to have breakfast at the Buffet at Caesar's Palace. But none of us wanted to wait for 45 mins to be able to eat. And definitely not when we were hungover.. . Instant seating meant we could order coffee and juices pronto.. The coffee was decent. And with multiple refills.. The Mango-Carrot juice cured my hangover. And my friend & I loved it so much, we ended up ordering 2 servings each!. . Our server was very sweet. Answered any question we had. And placed our orders pretty quick. The bread basket was very delicious. An eclectic blend of savory & sweet. The corn bread was yummaaaaaaay. And the chocolate brownie was melt-in-your-mouth yummy.. Between the 4 of us, we sampled a few dishes on their brunch menu:. . Goat cheese "Fundido" - While the dish does contain goat cheese, there's a strong flavor of other cheeses as well. Manchego being prominent. The corn chips that come with are fresh too. Beware, the dish is very rich, just as any other dish at Mesa.. . Spicy Chicken w/ sweet potato hash - This is an offshoot of your eggs benedict. It's literally eggs benedict on top of a very uniquely made sweet potato hash brown. Very well presented. And equally tasty.. . Spicy Scrambled eggs - This one had no chance. The husband inhaled it. . . Scrambled eggs chilaquiles - This is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. I couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. It probably is the best in town. The potatoes that come with are so yummy. Get those, skip the grits.. . Now, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, Mesa is not the place for you. While the food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. You might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in the process.. . Service was nice and on top of their job. Price was reasonable given that it's Las Vegas & Bobby Flay's place.. . I'll go back... maybe after I drop a few lbs...
Bobby Flay does it again. Everything about this restaurant radiates confidence . Bright colors , attentive staff , interesting menu items . I had the blue corn lobster tacos , the shrimp tamale, the roasted chicken dish and the coconut cake . I also had a citrus vodka drink to seal the deal . Across the board , everything was beautiful and tastefully executed.
I had the salmon and my hubby had the pork tenderloin. They were both amazing!. . We didn't have reservations on a Friday night, but the full menu is served at the bar so we just grabbed a couple seats, ordered some drinks and had a fabulous meal. . . The bartender was awesome and she even let me sample a fee of her specialties whenever another guest ordered one. The white peach margarita was my fave of the samples. . . The ambiance was nice, and I am certain we will go back and eat there the next time we are in Vegas.
As a rule, probably not one of the places I would venture to, as places on strip are over-rated and overpriced?? The service was very good, the food okay,as the portion are small for the price(on appetizers). My lamb chop was peppery, and lack a little flavor,, did not care for the brown sauce drizzle around it. I tried my friend's scallops, it was yummier.... The white peach margaritas were great, would of had a few more , but not at $14 ea,, maybe they need to sell it cheaper by a pitcher...I loved, the tiger shrimp tamale,, yummy-o.. Dessert were top notch, tasty.. Yes we had to order a couple of the tiger apps and blue pancake with duck,as all apps are only one on plate, if you are sharing a taste, more than a bite, the price adds up $$$$..
Wow, what a disappointment and I'm a huge bobby flay fan. Menu is "tired". Service was good. Wine was great. Food just seemed tired and dated, salad wilted and not supposed to be. Muffins dry. He's done several great new cookbooks in past five -seven years. How about picking its from them. Honestly my husband cooks bobby flay much better than this restaurant.  But hubby is an awesome cook!!
That rib eye was so good that I needed a cigarette after I was done eating it, good thing that Las Vegas lets you smoke indoors..too bad that I don't smoke. They must cook in a volcano, because the steak had a nice crust with the middle just barely warm ...22oz of awesomeness is what that was. The meat was tender and every bite wasn't saying "beef", it was screaming with neon signs..that is an awesome steak, my hat off to you Mr. Flay. We ask the waiter if the mashed potatoes (with a green chile white cheese sauce) could be shared, he said yes... no you can't share it..for one, it's a small side and 2 its too goo to share..you will want that bad boy all by yourself. I also had the roasted corn soup, my only complaint is that it's too small. It has a smoke chile flavor (not spicy) that balances well with the sweetness of cream. I've normally avoided "celebrity chef" restaurants in the past, thinking it was all hype. Mesa Grill changed that for me. The 3 items above plus 2 jack and coke came up to $128... not cheap by any stretch, but well worth the flavor explosion.
I brought my wife here for a special night while in Las Vegas and Mesa Grill did not disappoint.  Everything here was fabulous!  The wait staff, the drinks, and the food.. . We will be back!
