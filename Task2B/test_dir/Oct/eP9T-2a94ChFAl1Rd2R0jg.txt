I like the fact that there is no casinos in the hotel which gives you a break and I also like that they have a shuttle that picks you up and drops you off in the strip.  We had a suite the bed was super comfortable and a nice view but it did get noisy at times.
Loved this hotel. Very classy and clean. The customer service was excellent. Room service was prompt, front desk staff was friendly and efficient and the security was very gracious when I set the smoke alarm off by burning toast.. . Only complaint I have was that the Wi-Fi was pretty terrible.
I've stayed here a few times and this hotel is really amazing.  Everything is clean, updated, and really 5 start quality!   I love the fact that there is NO casino and that it is right across the street from fashion Show mall.  If you do want to gamble, the Wynn is a 7 minute walk and you can get your jollys there. Overall, very classy establishment! Great service as well!  Also, they provide FREE bottled water, coffee, and tea in your room!
I loved this hotel... Away from all the crowds, very classy, the rooms are amazing, the staff was very friendly. The free shuttles to wynn and ceasars a plus, would stay allways here... Love the fact that it doesnt have a cassino. I did not like the high prices on the convenient store at the lobby... They sell the same shampoo you have in your room, just a little bigger at 18 bucks... And a cough medicine at $50... Not cool... Otherwise perfect
Internet is the worst.  On the 3rd day of our 3 day stay i figured out the only way to get a decent wi fi signal on fl 26 is in the master bathroom.  TV's are unwatchable.   The hotel has some off beat satellite system which doesn't work.  I personally spoke to one of the hotel managers and she acted like she had not heard too many complaints on these issues.  She mentioned something about the gold finish of the building affecting the wi fi signal.  Sorry Trump.  I like your tv show but your las vegas hotel timeshare project is not up to the Trump standard.
The Trump hotel is one of few non-smoking hotels on or near the Vegas strip. It's geared towards business travelers, so during our stay the majority of the crowd was a bit more mature. Not that we're complaining though, as it was nice not to hear the ongoing 'Woos!' and 'Yeahs!' i'm used to hearing in other hotels.. . Both the hotel itself and the rooms were very spacious and well appointed - I think it's definitely worthy of the 5 star designation at a very reasonable price. The pool wasn't crowded at all and the gym was pretty stacked for a hotel gym.. . This hotel doesn't have a casino and dining options are very limited - although directly across the street is the fashion show mall which has plenty of food options.. . There's also a free shuttle to/from the Wynn and Caesars since it is on the far end of the strip.. . The only downside, as I read in other reviewers, but chose to ignore regrettably, is the sound of the horn of a freight train that passes alongside the hotel every night. This only affects certain rooms with a 'City View', as we had friends also stay in a 'City View' room but they specifically asked for a 'quiet room' and they couldn't hear it. I looked out the window and the train tracks are pretty much across the street from the hotel. How bad was it? I got woken up once a night by the horn.. . Would we stay here again? Definitely, considering it was much cheaper than the Vdara. However, next time we would likely stay in a room with a 'Strip View', or ask for a 'quiet room'.
The trump is a casino less and non smoking hotel (which isn't a bad thing).. Check in was ok, I didn't like the fact they kept on trying to upsale me.. It is a high end 5 star hotel .. I got a suite on the 50th floor facing the strip .. It was a living room + bedroom suite.. Nicely designed and equipped with a Kitchenette. . It's a short walking from the Wynn (if you wish to play). The things that I wasn't happy about were the big glass doors to the restroom and the shower that slams every time you close it, that I was actually afraid they will break.. The train does pass by once in a while and it is quite loud. I actually woke up at 2:00 am to the sound of its horn.. I had breakfast in the dining room , the food and service was good.
We truly enjoyed our stay at the Trump. We booked on a weekend where most of the rates on the strip were $200 or more and this was one of the hotels with a rate lower than $200. I read so many reviews and did research before finally deciding on this hotel ...and thank goodness I picked this one. . . We arrived at the hotel pretty late. There's only valet, but they have shuttles to the WYNN and CAESARS PALACE (which my bf &I took fully advantage of) and the checkin was easy and the staff was really nice. There is no casino, so it was nice walking in without being greeted with the strong smell of tobacco. . . When you get on your floor and find your room, there will be one big door for 2 rooms. It's sorta like a little foyer before you enter your room. I can say you get a lot for your room than most of the hotels on the strip. We got the deluxe king bed (floor 37) and it was super nice. We had a little kitchen (sink, fridge, microwave, stove) in the room, but no utensils (which wasn't a big deal, just buy some utensils at a nearby walgreens or something). In the same room, there was a little sitting area with a couch, coffee table .... and then the big king bed which had the most comfortable pillows. The bathroom is super nice with a bathtub (w/ a jet) that can fit 2 ppl, a two sink, a separate shower, and separate toilet with a phone inside. There's also a hair dryer and a makeup mirror for the girls. Plenty of towels in the bathroom so that was nice. Also they have a light system if you want housekeeping or not, without using the usual door handle paper. That was pretty cool. lol The wifi was pretty fast in our room despite the reviews I read from other ppl. Of course you get that from the resort fee you pay. . . Sadly we didn't take advantage of the fitness center or pool, but the room was more than enough for a good review. Many ppl complained about the train sound. For us our room was more towards the mall side, but you can hear the train. Yet it's not that loud for it to be an inconvenience (unless your room was on the other side). . . The shuttle services at the Trump was pretty good. You'll wait at the side of Trump and will wait 10-15mins for the next shuttle. It was a huge convenience for us bc we didn't want to drive nor did we want to spend on taxi. We mostly took the one to Caesar's and it probably took 10mins to arrive where they drop you off at the forum shops. . . I will definitely book a room at the trump the next time we go to Vegas because you get more than you pay for. If we booked at Treasure Island or Paris, I guarantee it will not be HALF as nice and accommodating as the TRUMP. Of course you sacrifice being near the strip, but there's shuttles so it's no biggie.
Nice property even though it's a bit off the strip.  Everyone was pretty friendly and helpful.  The shuttle to the Caesar's and Wynn was not as frequent as advertised and we waited nearly 45 minutes at Caesar's and they never showed up and ended up getting a cab.  Mentioned to the doorman and he said he'd let someone know.  Had to wait earlier in the day for 30+ minutes for the shuttle as well.  Overall, the shuttle was a waste of time for us.. . Room was comfortable but when we first got to our room the trash from the previous guest was overflowing under the sink.  We were very tired and just went to bed rather than call housekeeping.
If you are looking for a high class hotel in Las Vegas, stay here!!! For the price we paid, you can't find anything better! Mind you this hotel does not have a casino, so be warned for those wanting to stay at one with a casino.. . The Trump Hotel is very clean, smoke-free, and the rooms... WOW!!! Suite life for the price is unbeatable! You literally will feel like you are in your own personal studio apartment fully equipped with a full kitchen, living space, floor to ceiling windows, and the bathroom... Let's just say TV in the mirror, Jacuzzi tub, stand up shower and double sinks!. . As for the pool, great low key atmosphere with music that is not overwhelming or too loud.  The wait staff is a little slow, but that's probably the only complaint I have.  The pool area offers reserved day beds with an umbrella that are complementary if your tab is more than $75. Yes, only $75.00. For our party of 3, that was a no brainier... With drinks and lunch, we were easily well over the minimum.. . The hotel is off the strip, but they do offer shuttles to and from the strip.  I would definitely stay here again!
This hotel is just mediocre. Nothing special about it. Besides the fact that it's across from saks. Rooms are very clean. Beautiful views. Long check out and check in lines.
We had a great four day experience at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. It is a small but very decadent location, free of smoking, with superb waitstaff and service. They were very accommodating throughout our entire stay. We will definitely be back.
