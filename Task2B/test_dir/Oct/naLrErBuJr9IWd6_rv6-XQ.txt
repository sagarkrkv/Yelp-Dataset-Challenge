CUT did not make the cut. Sorry. I had to.. . It was a group of 10 of us. 80% of our steaks were not cooked to what we specified. I mean, this is a steak place after all. This is what they do, their wheelhouse, no? NO.  . . I asked for medium rare, like any other intelligent carnivore, and what did I get? MEDIUM, almost medium well. I complained but others at my table did not. It's a TRAVESTY to overcook steak at a steakhouse. Period.. . We ordered most of the sides. All were lackluster.. . Another celebrity chef who wanted on the Las Vegas bandwagon and opened a restaurant without thinking through and perfecting the menu.
Almost excellent! From appetizer to steak, and wine. Been there several times, almost tried every course on menu, except tones of wines there. One of the best in Vegas!
I can start by saying this place is expensive - very expensive. But unlike most places I've been in Vegas, I felt the value was there even compared to top steakhouses in places like San Francisco, New York and Omaha. (Yes, Omaha).. . The service was impeccable. What really set it apart for me is when I was looking for a spot to set down an empty appetizer tray and the sommelier - not a busser or waiter - grabbed it and bussed it. Really impressive.. . All the food was up to the highest steakhouse standards. I didn't spring for Kobe beef but I didn't regret that. My steak was excellent and cooked as ordered.. . We had a large group, ~18, and they did a great job accommodating us at two neighboring tables.
I can't imagine going to any other steakhouse in Las Vegas after going to cut. It's the food, it's just near perfect. Had the tuna tartare appetizer, picture perfect, the surf and turf special with Maine lobster and Japanese Kobe Beef. I if you never had Kobe like me you have to try it. Its expensive but the first bite says it all. There is nothing like it.. Service wine and dessert excellent.  Be sure to make reservation, it's very popular.
Great ambience with top service from beginning to end. Before going in you have to make a commitment not to sweat the  price because it is expensive.  I ordered Nebraska aged steak and it was outstanding. The wine selection is exceptional and the desserts totally decadent.
A transcendent experience, probably the best meal of my life (can I give them 6 Stars ?!?)   The combination of service, accommodation of plating requests, high quality food, great drinks and overall execution was just flawless.   Unforgettable evening !!   Cut fans for life !!!
Excellent waitstaff. Shoe leather steak. Everything else was very good, but the "steak" was very disappointing.
Maybe I went on an off night but at this price, I would never expect an off night.. . The staff is great and they recommended a really good bottle of wine.. . On the other hand, the steak was pretty bad. It was cooked to order, a nice medium rare with outstanding sear, but it just didn't taste good at all. I just find it hard to ruin a rib eye. It was dry and very bland.. . I can't recommend anyone going here.
Disappointing and over priced
I... don't know what to say. I had really high hopes for this place, thinking this would be one of the best meals of my life. But sadly, I was hugely disappointed.. . For a 6 oz steak that costs $85, I expected a lot more. I ordered the American wagyu filet mignon, medium rare. What I got was definitely more rare than medium rare.. most of the steak was red. I even started to question if they gave me the right steak, because it wasn't anything near amazing, like I expected after reading some yelp reviews about the American wagyu.  It was kinda tasteless, didn't melt in my mouth at all, and was even slightly difficult to swallow. Mastros in Costa Mesa is way better... . Other reviews on what we ordered:. Appetizer: bone marrow flan: this was pretty good. It had a lot of flavor.. even the salad on top was delicious and refreshing amongst all the heavy things we ordered. Not a lot in terms of quantity but very tasty. I think it's popular because it's so unique. Good but didn't amaze me. . American wagyu filet mignon: see above. This was ok... sad to say.. American wagyu ribeye: what my bf ordered. He always gets the ribeye and I always get the filet mignon, which is nice because we get to try both. His ribeye was ok. Not as fatty and flavorful as ribeyes usually are. A disappointment as well.. didnt have much flavor.  . Maybe we were supposed to order some toppings for our steaks to give them more flavor, but we wanted to taste the steak on its own since it's supposed to be such good quality. I guess that's what the sauces and salt (that they offer) are for. I'd rather the chef perfect the steak's flavor for me, though, since they're the pros and we're paying so much. . . Side: wild field mushrooms: this was ok. I would have much preferred other mushrooms. I wouldn't order this again. Be careful when you eat the big green pepper as it can be very spicy!. . Mac n cheese: this was actually really good! Not your typical mac n cheese. I loved the texture of the macaroni. . Wine: I forgot the exact one I ordered, but it was a cabernet sauvignon, which I always get. It was okay. . . Service was pretty good. They explain the cuts of meat to you, comparing Japanese wagyu and American wagyu. The servers were very efficient and seemed pretty busy. You should definitely ask questions if you have any. They were more than happy to answer my questions. . . In the end, our meal was $300 for two people (appetizer, two steaks, two sides and a glass of wine). I wish the price were justified by an unforgettable meal, but I'm left feeling pretty unsatisfied. I didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu, which says a lot. Trust me.. . Come here to experience a Wolfgang Puck restaurant if you wish, but just don't get your hopes up.
Ahhhhh the famous Cut! I have heard that this steakhouse is super good from an acquaintance so I decided to give it a try while I'm on a vacay. . . Interior: good! Glassy and dim lights! The Furniture is black, neat and comfortable. I like black and glassy places. Nice layout. . . Customer service: good again! Our guy was really friendly and nice. My girl had a few questions and he was very thorough while answering them. . . Food: hmmm I gotta say it's the biggest let down in my life. Given that the place has the four dollar signs, I thought it would be top notch. My girl and I got a bone marrow flan, American wagyu filet mignon and ribeye with Mac and cheese and wildfield mushroom on the side. The bone marrow flan was very interesting and unique. When I first heard about it, I was very confused. Flan is supposed to be sweet, but this particular one was cooked in a bone marrow. Me no comprehender! The bone marrow was good. That's all I could say. It's hard to explain so jus try it lol wildfield mush was aiite. It had that typical mush taste with a lil saltiness. Mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy on a decent level. Now the finale 'drum roll' the steaks were okay.. My ribeye was so plain that I thought maybe I was supposed to get a sauce.. And the thing is the meat itself wasn't exquisite like the waiter explained. It jus tasted like usda black angus prime beef in my opinion. There was nothing wagyu about it. For that reason, I give this restaurant three stars. Nothing extraordinary. Just plain.
Staff is great, wine list too. The starters were divine (wagyu carpaccio and steak tartare) and our steaks the way the were supposed to be: juicy, flavoursome, huge. . . Our 5-year old was treated like a prince and loved it.. . Not cheap though - but not more overpriced than other famous steakhouses.
