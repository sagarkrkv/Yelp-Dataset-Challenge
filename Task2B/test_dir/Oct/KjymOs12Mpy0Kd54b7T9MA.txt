Beautiful space, great for lunch, but would love to return in the evening. The food is pretty good - pricier than its worth but expected for Vegas. I would definitely return for a brunch or a romantic evening dinner some time.. . Also would be great to sit outside! Lots of reasons to return and try it again :)
The salmon entree and the scallops risotto was amazing. The salmon was moist, and the cream sauce that went with it compliments it perfectly. The watermelon salad was light and perfect too. But the dessert was a disappointment. The creme brulee was good and it wasnt too sweet. However, the molten lava cake was overcooked. The cake didnt even came out warm, and i wish it was a little more bitter than sweet
My friends and I had reservations at Todd English's OLiVES.  Located in the Bellagio, it was really nice to walk through such a famous casino and dine in style.  I also liked that their drink menu was on an iPad so you could pick a fancy drink!. . I had the Ricotta Ravioli, and it was delicious!  Very good, and the menu had a ton of other options.  The portion sizes weren't too much, and everything tasted really fresh.  In addition, there were definitely affordable options like flatbreads that made this a very accessible restaurant for such a fancy location and offering.. . I would definitely eat there again, if only to try to get seating on the coveted patio overlooking the Bellagio's famous water fountain show.
Love this spot at Bellagio. Has in my opinion the best view of the Fountains as long as you can get out on their elevated patio. Cool scene inside that is also very intimate and close quartered. Great for Lunch or Dinner. Love the beef carpaccio strapped over fresh arugula with capers.
I enjoyed my dinner at Olives.  However, with it being such an upscale place, I should have enjoyed the food and service more.  Service was lacking at the beginning, but got better as the meal went on.  . . We had a 5:15 reservation but be prepared!  We had to wait in line to get seated -- I found that to be odd.  . . So on to the food -- the foie gras appetizer was divine.  I had the gnocci and chicken, and there was scarcely 3 tiny pieces of chicken in the dish.  They were so small I had to hunt for them.  My partner had the sea bass, and that looked and tasted good, but the beans that accompanied the dish was weird.. . The entire meal with tip was $191.  I probably will never go back there when I'm in Vegas again.
Excellent drinks. Great bartenders. Great wait staff. Nice view of the fountains.  The grilled squid and octopus appetizer was a little chewey though.
Slow service at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning when the restaurant was not busy at all.  I was served raw chicken in my chicken sandwich.  Needless to say it was taken off our bill.  However, there is no excuse for that to ever happen.
Well its between a 2 and 3 star restaurant on the food. Yes I have had better.. The one dish to stay away from is the Calamari / Octopus appetizer. Its a very ill composed dish. There's garbanzo bean puree,garbanzo  beans and more beans. Both the octopus and calamari overcooked. It just doesn't all go together its ill conceived . . We also ordered the Brick chicken. Which was not Brick chicken at all. If you have ever had brick chicken its moist and tender and flattened. This was just oven roasted chicken.. Service was good, although our water poured water into our Pelligrino  sparkling water. . It's OK  but I have had better.
It was our second time at the restaurant. If you have time,make a reservation and get on the wait list upon arrival for the patio seat- beautiful fountains will entertain you while you dine! Service was wonderful, great wine list, foie grais was absolutely delicious!!! Last time we had scallops and steak for main courses and those tasted delicious from what I can remember. Had Chilean Sea Bass this time- save $$, don't order, I've had it better in every other place I ever ate sea bass at..
Had reservations on a Saturday night (10/11/14) with my wife and her parents. Wanted to sit outside but settled for inside as there was no open outside seating until after 9pm. Good ambiance and a nice setting with the fountains faintly visible in the background.. . Food: Menu had many options that looked great and we all ordered something different. Unfortunately, the food was so average to below average that it led me to write a review . The ladies each ordered a flat bread  (Prosciutto and Fig & Spicy Chicken Sausage). They were fine but nothing memorable. Below average dough with some fancy toppings. Father-in-law ordered the special, Braised Short Ribs. It had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Lastly, I ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. It was $34. It was an Olive Garden dish that had a bout 4 or 5 mushrooms in it. It even had the "Signature Dish" stamp next to it; it was a disappointing signature dish. I'm rarely a harsh critic when it comes to food but the price we paid and the meal we got was disappointing.. . So why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.... The servers, managers and everyone that had to answer a million questions from my mother-in-law. They were so friendly and genuine in their conversations. I am terrible and can't remember their names, but the staff that worked with our table saved the experience.
We made a reservation about a week ahead for a large party of 15.  They put us in two separate tables... HUH?  Minus 1 star . Then we waited by the bar until they could find one large table.... and about 3 drinks later we were seated.... UGH Minus 1 star.. . then we ordered and our food came and HOLY BEJESUS ITS SO DELICIOUS that I forgot I was annoyed.. . If you have somewhere to be (like a show) don't eat here.  If you don't have a show to go to... EAT HERE!!! EAT HERE EVERYDAY!!!!
It's just overpriced Italian food, I've been duped!! No, not really,.... but that's what my tired, semi jet-lagged brain was thinking at the time.. . In reality this place isn't so bad, I'd go as far as saying i enjoyed myself. After a 30 minute wait we were seated. The atmosphere was a bit more intimate and up scale.. . The pace sits on the Bellagio Fountains. If it's important to you, ask for a seat with a good view of the fountain because not many of them have it. . . Everything was overpriced, but hey, you are in one of the most popular hotel's in Vegas.. . The bread came out with some sort of olive pure dip or whatever, i'm mentioning it because it was memorable and delicious.  I had a glass of wine and a $34 bowl of mushroom Pasta. It was really a nice tasting dish, one thing that stuck out was the actual flavor of the pasta itself. It (the pasta) tasted homemade and stood out even among the sauce and other items. . . I'll file this in the "I'd rate this higher if someone else paid" category. . . Was here on 10/02/2014
We had reservations and when we were seated it was adjacent to the bar in the pathway of all the people going to the outdoor patio seating.  smack in the middle of the bar area.  I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a thoroughfare.  Not a very relaxing atmosphere.  Our server was good as well as the rest of the staff.  I ordered the charred octopus and squid which was like eating rubber bands...the octopus was the small tiny whole octopus in a chick pea sauce.  Not edible, very rubbery and certainly they were not charred.  My entree was the salmon and that was very good.  Not sure if I would return.
Looked like a wait, but after my wife said a few things to the server we were seated very fast. We had a very attentive server. We had drinks, both of us had the same thing. Very delish and had some kick so one was enough. For our food we had the Butternut Tortelli, Watermelon salad, and the grilled Squid & Octopus w/ chickpeas. Simply put, it was our best meal in Las Vegas. Decent portions and wonderful flavours. Fresh tasting. I could have eaten the Squid & Octopus all day. Love this place. Now to find out if there is one close to San Diego
Nice location right on the Bellagio fountains. If it's nice out its worth the wait for a balcony table.  Prices are moderate, considering its in the Bellagio.  We had the chicken margarita sandwich with sweet potato fries, the chicken was a tad dry and the fries just ok.  We also had a Tuscan flat bread that was good and had plenty of toppings.  For the view alone this place is worth checking out.
The food was tasteless and the beans were not cooked and hard. All four of our meals had no taste with the exception of the sea bass but it was on top of the hard beans. very very disappointing.
I came here for my birthday last year 8/25/2013  again it was a very boring restaurant boring customer service I did however tell the server to surprise me between the unique ravioli dish on the menu or the Seabass and she brought of the Seabass and I was very satisfied that was so stuffy in there that I thought like I was sitting on the gentleman next to me slap I wouldn't go back and less maybe I made reservations in advance for the patio at night to watch the fountain shoot off and be super close just for the photo up and maybe give the food another try!
