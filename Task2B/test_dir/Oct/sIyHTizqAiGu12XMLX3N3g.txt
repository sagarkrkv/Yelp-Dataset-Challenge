I'm not a big fan of buffet and such a small eater can't expand the stomach for buffet.  I found most of reviews were highly rated so still wanted to try this famous or the best buffet (so-called) during our trip!. . We went for dinner buffet on Wed night, we got the "Wait" ticket from the machine!  OMG! We gonna wait for 56 mins!  However, I saw the people got the ticket and went into line up right the way.  We followed them to do so.... Eventually, we waited over  1/2 hour and got seated.  . . When we walked in to dining room, we saw the tables were so closed like cafeteria style.  It was so noisy as well! Our server came to us and took the drink order shortly, my friend and I both took turn to check out the food.. . Honestly, such buffet price over $50 per person, I would expect it to be restaurant quality food instead of buffet quality food.  When I checked out the Asian section food, it's so disappointing. It looked like instant frozen dim sim or dish for reheating on the steamer.. . I started with some green and pasta salad, got 1 piece Alaska king crab leg. The prime rib was undercooked and kind of cold.  . . I got few desserts and all of it were too sweet for me.  It tasted like icing sugar desserts.. . I would say it's not worth the wait and money.
We were here for Sunday late champagne brunch into dinner. It was not mind blowing...perhaps it's cuz I'm Asian. I noticed people loved the Asian offerings, which I usually skip in a buffet because I have a specific pallet for all things Asian.. . Pros: Raw oysters were not gritty, fresh juices, truffle pizza, Asian-fusion desserts.. . Cons: The American fare consisted of beef sliders and hot dogs...lol; the fried chicken was bone dry. We had a table for 8 who had to pay the mandatory 18% gratuity, which wasn't worth it because they didn't clear our tables and couldn't top up our drinks.. . Everything else was ok and better elsewhere. Bottom line - not worth the money or the hype...unless you love Asian food.
As a Vegas local, I'm not a huge fan of buffets. To me, they're all about the same and I never feel like I eat enough to get my money's worth. And THEN a friend asked me to have dinner with her at Bacchanal. The atmosphere was classy and the staff was gracious and friendly. Although the restaurant was busy, our waitress never left dirty plates on our table and promptly refilled our drinks. Honestly, I've never seen so much food in my entire life! Every time I thought I got to the last station, I would turn a corner and there would be more food selections. Everything I got was delicious and although I'm not a seafood fan, my friend refilled her plate with crab legs so many times I lost count. The dessert bar is amazing! Had I known how delicious everything would be, I would have eaten less food and more cheesecake, cake pops, gelato and cookies. The almond cookies were the best I've ever had. I would gladly wait in line and pay $50 right now to have another one. I highly recommend Bacchanal whether you're a local or a tourist. Two thumbs way up!
Excellent buffet. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it definitely exceeded what I would have guessed this buffet would be. Waitstaff was curteous, funny and helpful, as were the cooks.  The food was outstanding, delicious and warm. The atmosphere was excellent as well. We went for breakfast, my favorite meal of the day, and I walked away happy. Yes, it's somewhat pricey, around $30 for brunch, but well worth the cost. So glad we came.
My family and I came in on a Saturday around 11am. I was expecting to wait a while, because it was the weekend, but we didn't wait at all. We walked right up to the front, paid and were quickly seated. For a party of 4, our bill came up to almost $200. Yeah, I got a little weak in the knees but we really wanted to try this place. . . As soon as you start making your rounds, you'll notice that Bacchanal offers food that would normally be served at a nice restaurant. It's hard to describe the experience, but it is definitely worth your money. You could taste the time and effort they put into their food. It's like eating at 10 different high-end restaurants at once. Of course, you should save room for dessert. They have everything from gelato, macarons, fruit cups, pastries, etc. . . In the beginning, you'll feel a little skeptical about how much money you just spent. But it will feel very worth it in the end.. . Bacchanal is a MUST when in Vegas. Just be prepared for possible long waits!
This place is one of the better buffets in Las Vegas. I've found that if you plan to eat here, pace yourself and prepare to pay a grip.  I came here with my fiance and for the two of us for lunch it came out to be about $95.  They have everything you can possibly eat here. It's probably pricey but they have a gelato stAtion and a variety of crabs to eat. I would say it's definitely worth trying and the for the price you pay its worth it. Just remember to pace yourself.
This used to be one of my favorite buffets. Now the price is insane and the quality has gone down.  The layout is horrible with major choke points for the meat. I'm here now and have been in line for 15 min.  The buffet has many empty tables. I get the opion management no longer cares about the customer experience. I expect things to flow better for $57 a person with tax. I will say, the desserts look killer.
Best buffet after the Wynn of course!!! I have been twice and would come again.  My favorite station is the meat , I loved the lamb chops, the ribs, and the prime rib.  It was so juicy and well seasoned.  I loved the little plates with the different entrees.  The dessert station was decent the highlight is the ice cream station love it!!!
I was a little disappointed that the second time around was pretty much all the same food for dinner. It was even $50 per person on a Wednesday night. I went during brunch my first time for only $35. Same seafood, same EVERYTHANG. Well everything was still good, I love the oyster bar. . . The service was great. My sister mentioned she forgot butter for her crab legs and all of a sudden a server walks by and handed her a cup of butter because he overheard us...talk about great service................
From: ChefDan the FlavorKing. . WHY are these people rating this crappy buffet so high?!!!! Because it has snow crabs and shrimp on it?!! You are NOT going to get your moneys worth I promise!.....ain't gonna happen.. . ONE STAR for the REALLY bad value, possibly two stars for the food.. . 1. Stood in line for 30 minutes watching the ridiculous OTHER line in front of the seafood buffet.. . 2. No King Crabs - They immediately run out at 7:00PM? and don't restock them.. Snow crabs - they slice them in half while chilled - HINT - go to the Italian side and they have them properly hot.. . 3. The rest of the seafood was a joke on each occasion...fake paella, fake ceviche, etc. Don't mind a fake version...just not a bad one.. . 4. Miniature hotdogs, hamburgers, and baked potatoes. REALLY?. . 5. Lastly a BBQ station, pizza station, and basically an uninspired dessert station. That's about it.. . On the desserts, at least do people a reach-around and fake a bananas fosters or something tasty. We flame that on our own buffets and it blows peoples minds.. . SUMMARY: $50 to stand in a bunch of lines and eat the above. Wow.
Yup, hands down the best buffet in Vegas. A little pricier then most but still awesome buffet.
Love this place. I went to 4 buffets during my trip and no other one was like it. Friendly staff. Great food. TONS of options. Everything was delicious and fresh. Expensive though. I'm just glad I could try it once. If I was rich then I would come back butttttt I'm not. :P
Best buffet on the strip. Hands down. Server was very friendly and attentive.  The food was great, definitely coming back here
PROS: Good variety, simple but elegant decor, complementary silicon grips for hot plates, buffet area is is "linear.". . CONS: Long waits during dinner/lunch rushes.. . Would recommend to guests looking for a buffet with variety while in Vegas that does not skimp on quality but can also endure long waits.. . -----. . My favorite meal during my first trip to Vegas recently was definitely Bacchanal. My boyfriend and I went for brunch on Sunday at around 11PM and barely beat the lunch rush crowd. Between waiting to pay and be seated, it was about a 15 minute wait! This was great because my boyfriend had been here for dinner before and waited 2 hours! . . Once in, I noticed that unlike a lot of buffets, the food area is like one big line you would go down instead of a bunched up area of food where people scatter into. I like this design better, as the line generally moves down in one direction and there is not that awkward bumping into people with hot plates (Which can safely be held because all guests are given little two-finger silicon grips for you to hold onto things that are left under heat lamps!). . . The variety is beyond that of the other buffets along the strip, which is the big reason why I think people flock this place. The largest area is definitely the seafood section and guests seem to load up on the crab legs that are constantly being put out. I went during that transition from breakfast to lunch but this seems like more of a place for dinner, especially since the selection for dessert is exceptional. A lot of the items were more heavy, which is something I would prefer for a not-the-first-of-the-day meal. Great place to fix a hangover if one is so unfortunate!. . If one MUST try the Caesar's buffet that everyone talks about, I would suggest going for early/late meals to avoid the crowds. It cuts the wait time and the employees are probably less on edge (The manager seemed short-fused with some of her employees while we awkwardly watched when waiting to be seated). . . I'm giving 4/5 stars because of that awkward instance and that because the breakfast/lunch/brunch items were heavier than preferred for 11AM on a Sunday.
Back again, and it was as good as I remembered!  Amazing hot and cold crab legs, as well as a host of additional seafood delicacies!  Try the Mushroom Truffle Soup, Sweet Potato Tots and Lobster Chowder before you fill up on anything else!  Desserts stand outs were the Creme Brulee, Caramel Cheesecake Cake Pop, Cheesecake Gelato, and Macaroons!. . The service was even better than last time, with an exceptionally helpful waiter bringing the guys additional plates of crab legs, so they didn't even have to leave their seat!  We only waited about 30 minutes on a Friday night.  Bonus, there's a cute bar just behind the line that comps your drinks if you play the video poker games at the bar!
After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. . . Time to get our glutton on, that's what!. . I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.. . There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. . . Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!. . I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.. . Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. . . If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   . . Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.
Ladies and gentleman...Here it is...The best buffet in Vegas. The Crab legs come out of a steaming pot. There is a huge variety of meat in the carving station.  The deserts are absolutely beautiful to look at and more importantly totally delicious.  I am totally impressed with the modern decor.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat.  It is pricey but worth every penny.
I think we went in to this with high expectations (which is what happens when you're rated so highly as a buffet / venue).  Unfortunately, we weren't thrilled with the food, the layout, or really anything about our dinner.. . We saved Bacchanal for our last meal in Vegas after being there for a week...  I'm disappointed that we did.  The food wasn't spectacular - in fact, I'd say pretty much everything was average at best.  The meatballs were absolutely the best thing on the whole list of food that we tried.. . I found that some of my seafood was loaded up with salt; not what I'd expect.  Let the flavours run through from light seasoning, and just high quality ingredients...  . . The ribs were dry and the flavour wasn't outstanding in general.. . Pizza was fairly good, so I will give them that.. . But everything was fairly mediocre other than the meatballs.... . I have tried to think if it was just because the price was what made it less than amazing... but I don't think so.  I think that if it were $25, I'd have felt the same.  During our trip, we did one other buffet, and also a Brazilian Steakhouse, but of these were better than our Bacchanal experience.
Pricey- yes; worth it- yes. This is hands down the best buffet in Vegas currently. The food selection is huge, the quality is great, the Desert section pretty amazing as well. Crab legs are already cut in half for you, all buffets should do that. I still enjoy eating at the rio buffet, wicked spoon in Cosmo, and other buffets; but this buffet is definitely on top of my list currently
This place deserves a solid 4 stars.  I would give them 5, but they are super expensive!!! Pretty standard for Vegas on price though.  Their fries, and seafood were awesome and this would be a good place to take a big group of people too.  There is so etching for everyone, great decor and pretty good service too.
I got there at 6:30, so there wasn't a line to get in.  When we left around 8, the line was long. I would say it looked like people would have to wait an hour to get in.  Not sure if it was because we went early, but the oysters and sushi tasted like it was sitting there for a while.  So I don't recommend that.  The chicken and waffles is a must.  The meats look delicious, but tasted a bit dry and too dry for me.  The desserts look great and are showcased so.  The gelato is nothing to rave about but the crepes are good.  I think you can have dinner just trying one of each dessert!   Overall, for $55pp, it's not bad.  I think because we went early, the food didn't move as fast, so a lot was sitting around, but food should be consistent no matter when you go right?
Exceptional variety across 9 stations including  seafood, american, mexican, italian, medittaranian, asian and desserts.  The seafood was my favorite with an excellent variety of offerings all cooked very well.  The meats at Americana were good, but the Mexican food was forgettable. Sushi was ok, but having eaten at Sushi Roku the night before it was anticlimactic to say the least.  Desserts were beautiful to behold but average to the taste. Bar is extraso for $50 either come hungry or go home.  Not a bad experience, but not one I will likely repeat.
Hands down, one of the best buffet experiences I've had. . . I think I ate my body weight in crab legs. The line was always flowing, and there's a person standing right there behind the counter, constantly refilling so there's never a lack. He was my hero.. . The Chinese food section was surprisingly tasty, although I merely tasted a few selections. I was focusing my night on seafood and meats, but I enjoyed most of everything I grabbed.. . The only disappointments were the wait to get in - over an hour (yes, it was soooo long), the table next to us got way more drink service and attention than we did, and although the desserts are extremely pretty, nothing really stood out as having amazing flavor and as something I'd go back for a second time.
OK, it's time to get out your fanciest pair of fat-pants. We have ourselves a buffet here, folks. And not just any buffet--it's a Vegas-style buffet!. . Back story: I was on a mission and meticulously planned out this meal. I came during the tail end of lunch so I could pay the lunch price but grub out on the dinner dishes. Yes, I'm so Asian. But 2:30pm was also the latest my stomach could last before the intense pangs of hunger kept me from functioning normally. I wanted to milk the most out of this buffet (I'm forking over nearly $40, yo!). I even went on an intense hike before my meal with only a Clif Bar to hold me over. I'm not joking when I say meticulous. . . Bacchanal is heralded as the best buffet in Sin City. Although I haven't visited any other buffets in LV, I won't really have any reason to if Bacchanal is the best...especially since the food here was simply average. There were a few highlights but even on a VERY empty stomach, I wasn't impressed. I'll give them credit though, the selection is extensive and quite diverse. However, nothing was so amazing that I would return. . . Like most things in Vegas, Bacchanal Buffet is a spectacle. From the chic venue to the paparazzi-esque photographers snapping a photo of you before you enter the buffet (because clearly you will look and feel like crap after the buffet), everything is over-the-top and grand. That's not bad but it can be exhausting. . . This buffet provides huge variety:. Seafood - raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, king crabs, clams, fish, seafood paella . Meats - BBQ ribs, briskets, lamb chops, chicken, sausages. Asian stations - sushi rolls, nigiri, dim sum, Chinese stir fries, BBQ pork, noodle soups (own station with "fresh" won ton mein, udon, etc.). Latin station - didn't check it out but there were plenty of chips, salsa, tacos, (did try the aguas fresca and they were super sweet). Desserts - cookies, macarons, ice cream/sorbet, flan, churros, cakes, brownies, candies, chocolate-covered strawberries, ice cream mochi (black sesame and green tea), and made-to-order crepes. Miscellaneous - sliders, Parmesan fries, sweet potato tots, pizzas, pastas, chicken & waffles. . Not to mention you have your standard salad and fruit stations. Sweet Jesus (or is it Caesar since this buffet is located in Caesars Palace?). It is so overwhelming. The only items that stood out were the lamb chops, unagi nigiri, green tea creme brulee, and churros. And these were enjoyed with an asterisk; the lamb chops were savory but 40% of it was purely fat. The unagi nigiri was surprisingly tasty but it had a huge roll of rice underneath. I liked the freshly made crepes (you choose the toppings and sauce) but that's just waaaaay too much, even to share. I was excited about the mochi ice cream but these were not handmade. I saw the staff unwrapping and dumping them out of plastic containers. Oh wait, I lied. I did enjoy the red bean ice cream!. . At the end, your money does go a long way in terms of the food offered. Although, it's just a lot of mediocre food and not the highest quality. . . P.S. I overdid it with my meticulous planning and didn't account for the delayed fullness. I went for three rounds of dessert when I should have thrown in the towel after the first one. I literally have never been so stuffed in my life and I eat A TON. I was 88.6% sure I was going to throw up at my table. Thank God (Caesars?) I didn't. Be forewarned, buffets can turn you into greedy monsters. Don't overestimate your stomach capacity!
Selection was over the top!!!! But that's all I could say super positive about it!!! Bakery selection was good. However, quality of food was questionable, I felt sick after.. Crab legs were to silty, seafood was ok, I have tried better. Meat has not been done well enough. The bottom line, for this price , you would expect better quality. I don't think it's the best buffet in Vegas!!! Surly not!!!
This place was amazing. We came here for a champagne brunch while celebrating a friend's birthday in Vegas, and she recommended this as one of the better buffets. There was a short line when we arrived around 11:30, but we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated, and our waitress was really nice! She was very on top of drink refills and was happy to bring as many mimosas as we wanted. Since we were celebrating, that was a lot!. . There is so muchvariety here that everyone will be able to find things they like. There's a really extensive selection of Asian foods, a number of Italian dishes (including some delicious charcuterie and breads!), a Mexican section, a homestyle section, a big salad bar, and a seafood section. Then a huge, free-standing dessert display in the middle of the restaurant, including made-to-order crepes and about 10 kinds of gelato.. . Everyone had different favorites and techniques. One girl ate two plates of crab before consuming anything else. Others went straight to the little-bit-of-everything, let's do this in order so we don't miss anything. Personally, I went straight for the meat. If I'm going to eat at a buffet, I'm not going to waste stomach space on side dishes! I really enjoyed both the brisket (smoked over peach wood) and the prime rib. The man who was carving the meats was particularly amusing. He greeted a number of groups as they entered/left and was very jovial and friendly!. . The desserts were a highlight, particularly the made-to-order crepes. We left the waitress know it was our friend's birthday, and she brought out a really lovely plate of mini desserts.. . I will add that I felt pretty terrible after eating here, but I don't think that was the restaurants fault. Anyone who starts the day with plates full of meat and 5 mimosas brings that stomachache on themselves!
PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. $116 waste of money. Go to Wicked Spoon or Wynn or literally any other buffet in town and you will enjoy yourself a lot more. . . I love a good buffet and for my girlfriends birthday dinner I was so excited to take her to the best, bacchanal. But we were amazingly underwhelmed. Heed these bad reviews, we aren't lying. The food was terrible, the lines were worse. When my waiter came around and asked how our meal was, I said it was terrible and when I glanced over my shoulder to him, I saw he had already moved on and wasn't listening at all. I emailed Caesars and told them my entire story and 3 days later received a copy/paste impersonal response that said "thanks for making us aware of that issue".. . CAESAR'S DOESNT CARE IF YOU COME OR NOT. They are too big too care as evidenced by the absurd $116 price tag and the 2000+ reviews. I care a lot more about you enjoying your meal than they do. They messed up my girl's bday dinner and didn't even care. Jerks.
We went there on a Monday night pretty long line it took about 25minutes to get in . They give you little Nasty rubber things to hold the plate with in case it is too hot. . I thought okay it must be really really good.. Don't get me wrong it is good but for $55 .....nah. Not for me. . Perhaps $35. Overrated
So I just got back from Vegas this week and found it necessary to report that.... . BACCHANAL HAS REDEEMED ITSELF!!. . I love this place now. It has redeemed itself so much that after this past trip I'm convinced that it's become a Vegas staple for any future visits. My complaint of salty food in the past? Non-existant. The food somehow became much better with a new and improved selection of items to boot. As well as the fact that the service was excellent. It was everything I wished it was upon my first visit here - guess it needed a second chance. . . Can't wait to go back! . . Until then I'll be dreaming of that pandan tiramisu.
Oh where to start.  I checked in our group and it asked if we were celebrating anything special. We were celebrating 3 birthdays, so I marked that.  The wait time to get seated, we were told, was 17-22 minutes.  We were instructed to come back when the system texted my phone and wait "a few minutes" for our table to get ready.  When we came back we had to wait in an enormous line to pay and then an obnoxiously long line to get seated.  After 45 minutes waiting to get seated (total wait time of one hour and 23 minutes now), we were finally able to sit down.  This was extremely nerve racking because we had show tickets and were seriously worried we would not make the show.  While we were in line they repeatedly pulled people from behind us in line to get seated.  Once seated our server came over and took our drink order.  She came back with our drinks and was never seen again.  We pretipped $10 and I wish we hadn't left that.  . Now to the food: the crab legs were great.  Sushi was exceptional.  Mashed potatoes were phenomenal.  Macaroni and cheese was good.  Lamb was tasty.  Good choices for desserts.  However, there is such a thing as having too much.  There were so many choices that I almost felt cheated out of my money because there's no way someone my size could get their money's worth.  Which, by the way, is an astronomical amount.  $56 a person just to wait for almost an hour and a half for a table that we spent 30 minutes at?  No thank you.  . Overall: food is great.  Service is terrible.  And you're lucky if you ever get seated.  Will not return ever again.  Save your time and go to the Wynn for a fabulous buffet.
So this is probably the most expensive buffet I will ever pay for in my life. But it was pretty awesome for a few reasons.. . Their paella is awesome. OMG so good, the sausages and cuts of beef are delicious. Their sushi is top notch. The mini lasagnas are great. Their pizza is so-so. I could rack my brains for a while to try and remember just the vast array of world cuisine you can get. They even have good mediterranean food, but was a bit bummed they didn't have an Indian buffet section.. . A big reason this is as expensive as it is is definitely the seafood section, they have Alaskan king crab, snow carb, etc. Its all fresh and amazing and you're subsidizing that no doubt. But you will have a moment if youre not used to spending a couple hundred almost for 2 people for one meal where you think, "oh man I could eat at _____ for a 10th of this." Also you'll fill up soon and think man there's just so many choices, if you like one item are you cheating yourself by getting more of it by trying another of it versus a new food item? Needless to say anything that was just meh I didnt finish. But its totally worth it to do it at least once. . . There is usually a huge line for this place around dinner. Shoot for early bird. We waited like 20 minutes or so and my feet hurt from walking on the strip. The layout is nothing too special IMO for seating - all the food stations are like continuous in a cafeteria buffet kind of way except for the dessert which is off to itself in the middle. It starts with seafood, then Spanish, meats, American-ish, Mexican, Italian, Med, then Asian cuisines til the end pretty much. They bring you your drinks and its a cool thing to check out if youre staying at Caesar's.
If you're like me and you don't have a lot of chances in your home town to try new and interesting dishes, you probably come to Vegas hoping to broaden your horizons. Here's your chance to do it. Food and cuisine from all over the world, interesting combinations and dishes. All for 30-60 dollars, depending on the meal. The food is well prepared, the selection is impressively varied, and the place is clean and trendy.
Ok. Breakfast buffet was about 50 a person. Beautiful buffet.  Crab.shrimp. Shrimp and grits.  There was a piece of plastic in my food. Showed server he says ok. No one came to talk to me. .    We also pre tipped so we had to ask for refills. Maybe next time we won't pre tip.we also didn't see the 2nd room of food. Back there was omelet station. Meats and cheeses ( Italian foods) sushi/etc..   Over all it was good. Beautiful buffet.  Lots of choices.
We came here on a Friday about 4:30pm and there was no line!! I paid around $130.00 for 2 people because I figured it would be the same price as a steakhouse. (I found out later that the buffett was a bit more) If you are looking for steak you will disappointed like I was. I assumed that steak would be an option because of the pricing of the buffett but I was wrong. They had other choices like lamb, prime rib and chicken. You can get most of these choices at other buffets for much cheaper. . . I skipped over to the seafood which had Alaskan crab legs and rock crab claws. The Alaskan crab legs you can get at most Las Vegad buffets but the rock crab claws I haven't seen. The reason why I was dissatisfied is because they don't have crab claw crackers. I was told they had wooden mallots but I didn't want to go in that direction because we were seated too close to the other table. I didn't want to have crab shells flying all over the place so I just had the crab legs.. . I checked out the Asian station but I didn't find anything special. It was comparable to the Rampart Casino Buffett ( which isn't saying much). The dessert bar had no real stand out items for me.  They had gelato and an assortment of pastries. They do have fresh juices though but I didn't try any of them. . . It is a good buffet but it is overpriced for what it is. If you must try it to see for yourself then you should go but if there is a long line I would think twice.
By far one of the best buffets in Vegas!! It is quite pricey but all the food selections make it worth it. Wait wise is okay depending on the time of day you go. They set up a kiosk that texts you when it's busy. Their selection of crabs legs steamed or iced is one of a kind. No other buffet offers steamed or iced. Dessert section is amazing with gelato, crepes made to order and their huge choices of cakes. Peach tea is a definite must. You'll definitely need to be wheeled out afterwards!
Considering that this is a buffet, and comparing it with others in the area, is the reason why i came up with my rating.. . The wait on Sunday Brunch, was expected 40 minutes. I thought it would be worse actually.. . Presentation wise, and cleanliness, they hit all high scores. They got this whole strip buffet thing pretty much down. . . The normal stuff you see during Sunday brunch is there, all were displayed deliciously; eggs benedict, sausages, bacon, hash. Nothingfrom the norm, didn't eat much of that part.. . They have a huge part strictly for seafood, your normal crab legs, but also lobster corn chowder, lobster biscuits, and seafood paella. I didn't try any, unfortunately I'm allergic.. . Love their take on peking roast duck, and char siu pork. all cooked perfectly. Great selection of italian cheeses and meats. mushroom polenta was suprisingly good. . . Star of the show, was smoked salmon in the sushi section,of course prime rib and their braised oxtail. the meat was tender, fall of the bone tender. great flavor.  Just a few reasons why you are paying top dollar. . . Desserts were also fantastic. took a pumpkin chessecake pop, never had it like that before but it was definitely a refreshing surprise.Passion fruit cheesecake was also good , i just hoped they put more of the passion fruit. Buko Pandan tiramisu, was executed very well, not to sweet, but you still got the flavor of the coconut. Flan, was good, it wasn't the normal sweetness  I am accustomed to in the filipino culture, but it packed flavor. If there was one thing, I didn't like it was the rice pudding w/ cranberry shooter. For some reason it tasted weird to, rice pudding had cinnamon in it, mixed with cranberry it wasn't the most satisfying taste.. . For what it's worth, the service was excellent, they filled our glasses, with our drinks and mimosas. when we requested for something specific, they would come back quick. So the experience overall was definitely worth every penny,
I have no idea how this buffet tastes because their system is awful. We showed up at 7:20 on a Sunday night to have time for a 10:00pm show at the same hotel. We had to put our name in a digitized system to come back and pay at 8:23 - the system absolutely was pointless. We waited until 8:40 to be told we wouldn't be seated until 9:15 most likely, and for a party of two there was nothing they could do. If they had said the wait would be an hour longer than our time to pay we wouldn't have wasted our time, but we ended up instead with a very irritating experience. 0 stars if it was possible for this.
The only reason i am giving one star is because the food was great. HOWEVER the customer service is non-existent and we were higly offended and had a horrible experience.. We both work in mortgage so customer service is a huge deal! PLEASE read on:. . We were waiting in the general line, and since i am 6 months pregnant and was very hungry, my husband asked the cashiers on the VIP side if we can pay extra to skip the line, the lady proceeded to tell him sure come over here and wait. So he pulled me out of line and we stood in the express line. After waiting a while we asked her if we can pay already, since the other general line was already moving along. She said "i have to take the vips first" mind you there were hardly any people walking up on the VIP side, we asked again a few minutes later since the general line was moving and we could already have been closer, she responded ill get my manager. We said fine!. . Manager comes over and we explained the situation, and that we could have just stayed in the general line and saved time and hassle. She apologized and asked us to go ahead and pay, SO another cashier takes us and although we didn't pay the extra charge (why should we when we could have been there already at general line) but she did not ask us our name for the party on the ticket.. And so she took it upon herself to type on the reciept that our party name was "ANGRY"!!!! SERIOUSLY WE WERE LIVID!. Our entire interaction was calm and honest we just said it like it was, never were we angry, regardless of the fact what kind of person types the customer's name as ANGRY!??? . Did i mention i am 6 months pregnant!? this discriminatory action and unprofessional customer service is totally unacceptable. This is ceasars palace?? Ha! didnt feel like it!. . The manager came over and when we showed her the reciept she was embarrased turned red and appologized continuously. She reveresed the charge and gave me a complaint form to fill out. She said someone will contact us about the incident in a couple days, its been over two weeks now and no one has called us!!! so this is the review they get!!! and i will continue to spread this rediculous action we experienced at supposedly the nicest Buffet in vegas people spend hundreds on!!??? i think not!
Sooo... I just thought it was OK. JUST OK. 2.5 stars really. If I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, then maybe their Monday lunch spread (holiday Monday) is more ordinary than usual. Nothing really stood out, and there were no unique dishes. I didn't really try everything because I was so underwhelmed and had no desire to. . . A few points:. -The crab claws were near frozen and the meat stuck to the inside walls of the shells. You really had to scrape it off!. -The "fresh" juices tasted watered down and had no sign of pulp to indicate they were fresh. -prime rib and sausage from the carving station were the best items. . Most disappointing of all was the service. My dining partner always gives a generous tip, even if the service was bad. I was already a little irked that he decided to tip pre-meal at 18%. Anyway, our "server" never came by to offer a re-fill of water or coffee yet our plates were always gone after left our table. I had to flag him down 3 times for one thing because each time he was on his way to our table, he gotstopped by another table flagging him down. Wouldn't that just piss you off, too??? lol . . I'll be sticking with Wicked Spoon or Wynn!
It is the best Vegas buffet I've tried. Alot of variety. Very clean and well organized. Our sever was very nice. For tourists this is perfect because you can try Chinese, Mexican, meat, Japanese, Italian, seafood, etc. Since I'm from a city that has excellent ethnic food and other food. I rather go somewhere that specialize on one type.  So much food!!! Not a great deal for me since I could not take full advantage and get my $53 worth.
We went there about a year ago and it was fantastic with a large the array of food choices.  Since we had such a great experience we took some friends there and for some reason the choices of foods was very limited. We were very disappointed especially when it costs $60.00 per person.  . . I don't know if we will go back.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and MANAGEMENT SKILLS! I am an MBA and specialize in online marketing. They completely false advertise their prices on their website and on Yelp. When you confront them, they state that they are not the ones who post their menu and pricing info online- which is completely not true. They are rude to their customers and talk back to you when you confront them that they have the wrong pricing online. They false advertise and their manager Wolfe heisey is especially RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!! instead of being courteous and nicely responding to your concerns, he gives you a cocky attitude and treats you with disrespect. I am pregnant and should not be talked down to that way, very disgusting and not managerial behavior. Rather than being cocky, he should be courteous to any customer that approaches him. It was very disrespectful. And harassing. Completely deserves ZERO stars for their poor customer service and rude behavior.
The best buffet of my life!
Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =). . No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!. . I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. . . I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. . I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. . My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening). My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. . Last but not the least, Dessert. . . My food rating of each dish:. GREAT DISHES. *Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. . *Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. . *Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!. *Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!. . GOOD DISHES. *Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?. *Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. . *Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. . *Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it). *Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!. *Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a "Dacqoise" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. . *Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. . . OKAY DISHES. *Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. . *Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. . *Creme Brulee - not too sweet, yum. . *Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!. . BAD DISHES. *BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. . *Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. . *Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got "Mint" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream / gelato. . . Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. . . Service was good. . . Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. . . The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.. . I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. . . The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. . . Solid 4 Stars. . Try it for yourself and decide.
Beware - gnats abound in this buffet. The presentation was unbelievable but when we settled in for desert the gnats attacked. Having spent over $100 for dinner for 2 I asked for a manager. This goon named Wolf came and said this has been a problem before but since we were onto desert there was nothing he would do for us. I contacted customer service after arriving home and while they were sympathetic all that was offered was a return visit. Since I was 2500 miles away I asked for something comparable in one of their locations closer to home and was ignored. No reply at all. Needless to say I will not be returning there or any of their other locations.  . Follow up -  It took contacting their corporate office several times but eventually they did the right thing and gave me a full refund.
Appearance . Open buffet area with some hidden private tables. Clean,  med.lighting, dominated by glass and woody motifs    . . Food . The food her is amazing.  I rivals my other favoeite buffet which is Harrah's of Atlantic City Buffett.  I thoroughly enjoyed the many many flavor available.   They have 4 sections for you endulgence and develop a food coma: asian (peeing duck, sushi, noodles), Italian (pizza, pasta, cheese,  cured meats), American  (Bbq, mac n cheese,  fried edibles ), seafood ( raw bar, snowcrab, shrimp cocktail) AND ALOT MORE.  Not to mention the Dessert island.  All the meats were cooked well and the BBQ BRISKET was OUT OF THIS WORLD! -rich,  tender, savory.. One of best brisket I've ever ate, orgasmic at best! . . Staff. Friendly helpful. . Servers are prompt and courteous.  Ask for Fernando he is a funny host which will entertain you while you're in line..                                             . Price. $36 for lunch.. just before dinner to save on the lunch price.
This was the second time I visited this buffet in Vegas. I had such s great experience the first time around, I had to bring my dad. . . First time wait: 2+hours then you get texted to go pay. Then I wanted an additional 30-40mins to be seated. Famished!. . Second time wait: none. 30mins to get seated. . . Food: great variety of seafood (oysters, stone crabs, snow crabs legs, other hot seafood creations), meats (prime rib, trip tip and or sirloin, turkey, duck, lamb chops) and other ethnic foods (street tacos, sushi, Chinese, dim som, pho/udon noodle station) plus your regular salads, cheese, fruits, desserts and bread stations. . . Service: mediocre. It takes the servers a while to get your drink and refill. The dirty plates were left on our table until my leg crabs carcasses practically crawled on the table. Slower than my past experiences. . . Price first time: I came at dinner time so it was $50.99 a person. Dinner price. . . Price second time: I paid right before 3pm on a Friday. $34.99 (one dollar off with players card) lunch price. . . Quality of seafood: oysters were more fresh the first time around. The second time around, they looked a bit dry and dehydrated. Crab legs were smaller second time around in comparison to the first. Stone crabs were okay. Not much flavor to them but meaty. . . Even though they have a great variety of food. I feel the lunch price is more reasonable. I did not notice any difference with food selection from lunch to dinner. By then again, by the time I went in, it was already dinner time.
The Bacchanal Buffet @ Caesar's Palace opened in 2012 as an expansion in the brand new,Octavius Tower.The buffet is MASSIVE AS HELL!It's so DAMN big that you might even get dizzy from it!Bacchanal Buffet's atmosphere is great,you sit in spacious leather couches.The buffet is bright, unlike the 2 buffets before this one.There is SO MUCH DAMN FOOD in this buffet!There's Seafood,Chinese Food,and etc.This buffet doesn't have crab legs or lobster tails,but since the other food selection is huge,that might not even be a problem.I lost count of what they had because the buffet is so large.The dessert,HOLY SHIT!The dessert option in this buffet is ENORMOUS!There are your cakes,Creme Brulee,Choco Strawberries,Ice Cream,Mochi Ice Cream,and more.This buffet is SO EXPENSIVE.It's about $50 per adult including tax.If your child eats a lot,go in the buffet and lie about his/her age and pay only $27 for him/her.The waiting line is also long,but if you have a Diamond Tier Total Rewards Card or above,then you can use the V.I.P. Line.You can also get discounts with your Total Rewards Player's Card.
Best buffet I've ever experienced! This will be my one stop every time I visit Vegas going forward! Crab legs and Sushi are a must try! The street tacos were super delicious and the dessert station was unbelievable!
Not good for parties. You don't get seated as fast with a party of 5 or more. If going with 5 or more, it's better to split up at check in.
I do love their ticket waiting system so we don't have to wait in line for hours. When we arrived at 4:30pm thinking the line will be shorter we later found out we have to take a ticket and return on the time it tells us to which was 6pm. Not thrilled about it but better than standing in line.. We dined at the Wynn and Bellagio buffet so we though this should be similar price and quality. $140 for 2 people!!! It almost made me want to walk away!. Food quality and selection is good but $70 a person is still a lot for a buffet. I will suggest you to come try it once but be prepared for the ticket shock. . I know some people compare the price with a fine dinning restaurant and think it's a good price but I compare it with other Vegas buffet and think it's not worth the wait and the money.
Don't believe the hype! . . We came here for brunch after reading yelp reviews and seeing the long lines. The price for brunch is nearly $50 per person after tax and it's really not worth it. Rumors of macarons and delicious food were false. Maybe true for dinner or some other sitting times but definitely not for brunch. The food was underseasoned and tasteless. The sushi bar was disappointing. The dessert bar was either bland or bland, with the exception of the green tea creme brulee which was excellent. But still not enough to carry the price of the meal. . . If you can eat your weights worth of Alaskan crab legs, then this is the place for you. They offer hot or cold legs that are split in half for easy consumption. It does have a large variety but a lot of tasteless food or salty food is worst than grabbing a quick bite at McDonald's.. . People come to Vegas for the buffets as well as the shows and the gambling. Sadly, this place may have been a great buffet once upon a time. But with hype comes price increases but sadly the quality of food does not live up to its reputation.
best buffet in town....
Best buffet in las vegas. They have fresh oysters and great meat. And my favorite is the sweet potato tator tots. People forget its a buffet so it wont be perfect and people complain about $50. Go get some king crab and a dozen oysters and you will be charged at least $50 anywhere in vegas but here you get that and drinks and dessert and steak and more. Think about it
Love this buffet! Totally worth the price!! Crab legs, italian, soup, chinese, and the desserts!! Awesome job! The dessert section is bigger than some buffets in Vegas! Great! Will always go back!
Not as great as I thought it would be. There was a lot of hype to this place when it first opened up so I decided to give this place a try. To be honest I wasn't all that impressed especially for the price point . Not worth it. The food was mediocre at best. There are other buffets out there with better food and better prices.
Great selection of sea foods and meats.   Roast beef is very good. And so are the steamed King crab with lemon juice.   Asian food are not very good from an Asian's stand point.  Desert are good.  Especially the fresh made crepes.
I tried it out since everyone was raving about the quality of the food. I was not impressed. It was "pretty good for buffet food" but that's not really saying very much.... . My favorite thing was the street tacos, but for the price I paid to get in; I couldn't have gotten that else where. . . . I doubt I would go back.
The buffet was great...so much food ...chinese food, japanese food, italian food, american, mexican, seafood....food food food. they street tacos were good. If you are hungry and dont know what you want to eat ...this is your place...breakfast is about $18, lunch $35 and dinner $50....get there early....we waited in line for one hour...not sure if it was worth it....the dessert bar was pretty cool had every thing I wanted. I tried the mango pudding...yummy and pretty.... :) I didnt like the fact that they crabs were not steamed and hot....Im not a fan of cold seafood. The american buffet was great....the staff there were also funny and friendly...made me smile...I perhaps was overwhelmed with all of the food choices. ....lamb chops, prime rib, mac and cheese :), wings, chicken and waffles...OMG...food fatty.
This is by far the best buffet in Vegas, hands down. . . The variety is amazing! There are food stations featuring cuisine from all over the world and, of course, the vegas standard: lots of seafood and dessert. . . The stations I remember: Mexican, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Standard American, Southern American, Spanish, Vietnamese, Seafood, Dessert, etc.. Like, seriously, it was a LOT of food. . . ProTip: Go on a weekday, much cheaper!
Amaaaazing! It was worth every single cent. Some of the best food I've eaten on this trip, with a huge selection from all sorts of different styles of cuisine. It was wonderful.
I've been here probably 5 times since they very first opened and got all those rave reviews from the media. It's gone slowly down hill as they have taken off some of the best items like the tomahawk ribeyes and they are hit or miss on king crab legs, some times they have it sometimes they don't. The service is horrible for Caesars palace level. Still it's worth going only when you time it right and come when its slower. Would never wait for more than 20 minutes much less the hour or two during peak times.
I'll be honest:  I wasn't too thrilled about eating at a buffet during my Vegas vacation earlier this month.  I didn't want to eat anywhere that quite possibly had little kids sticking their fingers into the chocolate fountain (hello, Golden Corral).  But my husband really wanted to check it out, and he was paying, so what could I really do about it?. . Turns out, this is a very nice, well thought out buffet.  Much better than any buffet I'd ever been to.  Granted, the price for lunch was almost $40 a person, so I wouldn't expect (or shouldn't expect) anything less than stellar.  But the variety was what made this buffet so awesome.  You have your standards, but there are also several international stations, like Japanese, Italian, Indian, etc.  I'm putting dim sum on the same plate as my polenta, mashed potatoes next to a bowl of chicken chile stew.  There's seafood, sushi, eggs benedict, with chicken and waffles and a large array of assorted desserts and gelatos.  It truly is an amazing buffet, in variety especially. There would be something here for everyone.. . Food was very tasty.  Cleanliness was top notch.  Even the speed with which we went through the long line was pretty decent.  So despite my unwillingness to go to a buffet restaurant on my vacation, I'd have to say since I had to go, I'm glad it was this one.
Just like anything in life you get what you pay for.. Avoid the line with the express pass. Service can be rather slow but don't worry just flag them down!. Good bloody mary!. . Cheers.
I think this is easily the best buffet in vegas. I have lived here for almost twenty years and I have been to almost every buffet, but this buffetoffers the largest selection of high quality food. I highly recommend this if you are visiting Las Vegas. . I went with a friend to this buffet and he had an express pass, which saved SOOO much time. The lines for dinner are extremely long if you don't have a pass. But really, this place is just gorgeous; the atmosphere and the food are unbeatable! The service was pretty good too.. I definitely recommend this buffet although it is quite the investment in one meal...
LOVE THIS FREAKING PLACE. . . Pros: . -SO much variety! . -Dessert bar is AMAZING . -Crab, sushi, pho, meat, shrimp...literally everything is so good. . . Cons: . -Can be pricey! But SO worth it...so then is it really a con? hmm..... . . Tip: Arrive at 2:30 so you pay lunch price but receive a little bit of lunch and dinner when the menu switches over to dinner at 3:00!
I am usually not a fan of buffets nor do I easily give out 5 stars, but this really merits the best rating.. . First, you feel like you are in a decent restaurant, not a sleazy area reserved for freeloaders and losers, as is the case of most buffets.. . The "spread" is not only diverse, but the quality exceeds most places specializing in the various stations offered here.. . I fell for the brisket, topped with a special sauce, but not before I tried the "sliders", Mexican specialties, mac and cheese, the sea food appetizers, and various other entrees. All were the best of quality. . . My Korean wife, stayed with the Asian selections, and as picky as she is, was not disappointed. . . The desert is rare as it really is gourmet quality.Even some of the finer resort buffets do not begin to match the deserts. It is truly worth the price of admission.. . The price is steep, about $60 per person, but once in a great while, this is an indulgence to celebrate, or just reward yourself.. . Yes, this is what Las Vegas buffets used to be all about. Quality, and for visitors, an experience to tell the folks back home.
I love this Buffet. It's a little pricey, but can we complain? It delievers on damn good food. I hope the their standards stay the same and I'll keep coming.
People don't waste your money. This Buffett is not what you would expect from "The best Buffet in the USA". It started with waiting for 30 minutes in line. The waiter only asked once what we want to drink. After that no show. The plates were almost never removed from our table. A lot of the food was blend, dried out or was sitting way to long. I was missing the special twist in the food. There was nothing special about it. One hour after eating there I am feeling somewhat sick. Spending 55 bucks for that? Never ever again. Go to the Wicked Spoon instead. Way better choice with the twist. Overall super disappointed.. Addition: I am very sick after having eaten there. It was either the oyster or sushi. The entire night running fever, chills and very bad cramps. I will never ever go there again.
I am one disappointed buffet-loving foodie. :-|. . We finally had a chance to try out Bacchanal while we were in Vegas for the Olympia this year. We had a group of 6 for dinner here about 90 min before they were closing.. . Let me just cut to the chase on why I don't ever plan on Bacchanal-ing again:. 1. The wait for this place is somewhat confusing. You walk up to this lady that gives you a ticket and she tells you, "15 min for your group." So we're thinking, "Wow! Only 15 min to get seated? Awesome!" WRONG-O! It's about 15 min to get in a line to then pay and get in the longer line to get seated. Boo! Don't tease us like that lady!. . 2. They seated us wayyyyy in the back, like literally having to trek it out to even get to the food. There were plenty of tables closer to the buffet area that needed to be cleaned off. Seemed like they were understaffed.. . 3. Food. Blah! Yep, I said it. Everything seemed too salty and not much effort put into cooking it. Only thing I really enjoyed were the snow crab legs and their sweet potato tater tots (which were probably frozen to begin with).. . 4. Pricey. Yes, it's a Vegas buffet, I know. But the quality of the food is not up to par to have it priced "Vegas style".. . Here's one plus that actually solidifies why my review is staying the way it is:. Our waiter was hilarious. He had jokes up the culo. We also were really upfront with him and told him the food wasn't all that. So..he also let us in on a little tidbit. Apparently, the old food court at Caesar's that closed down had chefs over there that held seniority. So those crappy food court chefs quite possibly booted out the stellar chefs that first started out here at Bacchanal and that is why the food is crapola today.. . My live review in my YouTube vlog here during that weekend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
Bacchanal Buffet has dethroned the Wicked Spoon Buffet as my favorite buffet in Vegas. I'd still go to Wicked Spoon when given the opportunity, but I'd say Bacchanal is superior in essentially every aspect.. . More variety of foods, better selections, and better tasting food. . . With the popularity that Bacchanal has gained, they now have a ticketing system that works very similar to that of the Fast Pass at Disneyland. You get in line to input information into a call-back system. They print out a receipt and text you when your turn is up. This, I'm assuming, helps with their line so that people don't crowd the Bacchanal area. Also, if the wait is 2 hours long, you can go to the Forum shops, go blow some money on the tables, then come back.. . After you get back, you get in line to pay, then get in line to be seated. With so many lines and checkpoints, I guess this added call-back system is necessary.. . One thing that annoyed me was that we came here for the Champagne Brunch and were forced to pay the higher price, even though my wife and I don't drink. But alas, we fell victim to this.. . They had a raw bar, meat carver, street tacos area, stews and soups, Italian, and an Asian section. Some highlights were the prime rib, the seasoned steamed shrimp [if you didn't want it cold], the wonderful cheese selection, the Kalbi, and the awesome and amazing sweet potato tater tot balls. Oh My Amazeballs - those were awesome.. . Everything else was just us pigging out and eating in absolute gluttony and excess. . . What was very disappointing was the dessert bar. I've read review after review of how great the desserts were and how extensive their selection is. Sure, there is quite a variety and a great selection... but everything was underwhelming and quite a disappointment. The Bacchanal dessert bar is like Floyd Mayweather - rich and flashy, but surprisingly disappointing when you realize he can't even read a book. The flan was dense and thick when it looked beautiful and light. The black sesame gelato had no flavor. The cakes and cookies, while looking exquisite and beautiful, were .. again.. disappointing. . . So yeah.. for the price you pay, you certainly get a great variety and, as with the Wicked Spoon, or any other buffet, there are plenty of hits and misses. Bacchanal sure had its share of hits, but the dessert bar is a complete miss.
If you are going to check out one buffet in Vegas, this is the one to check out! Food is amazing, excellent selection. Have been here many times, and brought many friends and family. Never had anyone that was disappointed.
Believe the hype! This place is awesome. I've been to many buffets and I can now say that this is one of my favorite places. Unfortunately, this place is a little more pricey. Bacchanal replaced their old buffet at Caesar's palace, which is a good thing because their old buffet was horrible.  For a party of 2 on a Friday night, we waited 20 minutes to pay for our meal and 15 minutes to get seated. Not too bad, at all! I was expecting longer wait times.  When you pay, you have the option to tip in advance....I don't recommend this. I tipped during payment, but I wish I had waited until the end because our server wasn't great. . . The food: there's too much to talk about so I'll just going to highlight a few things. The sliders are amazing! Just be careful because their plates are hot. The patty just melts in your mouth. I would also recommend their prime rib and sweet potato tots. My favorite of the night had to be there king crab legs. They offer both iced and hot, oddly they are at two different stations. I prefer the boiled crab legs. When I approached the station, I had a big grin on my face as the server lifted the lid and grabbed a bunch of steaming deliciousness for me. By the end of the night, I had about 3 plates full of just the crab legs. You'll also find fresh squeezed fruit juice, such as guava, pineapple, cantaloupe, etc. Although these sound good, I wasn't a big fan...they were tasteless to me. The dessert station is on the side and they have a bunch of great things. They had freshly made crepes, gelato, pastries, cakes, etc. Before arrive to Bacchanal, I browsed and found a things I wanted to try and I was a little disappointed that I didn't find some of those items...mainly the watermelon and feta cheese salad and their deep fried chicken wings. . . The service here was below par, which is something I didn't expect coming from a place that charged us $50 for dinner. First, at the meat station, I asked for some baby back ribs. The server grabbed two, but as he was transferring ribs to my plate, he accidentally hits the light lamp that was above the meat. I was thinking he'd get me a new piece of rib, but he proceeds to give me the same one which was contaminated with dust. Also, he looked as if he hated his job. Second, our server dropped by to get our drink orders. Period. That was all we saw of her the entire night. Other servers were there to take away our old plates, but no one filled up our drinks. . . I am giving this place 4 stars because I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. They could have gotten 5 stars if their service was better. Most people will come to Vegas and have the Buffet Buffet, but I'd recommend this as  a place to try. You will not be disappointed.
Friends who ate here told me I just had to eat here no matter what. I'm not a huge fan of buffets but after hearing there were over 500 items to chose from & it being the largest buffet in the world (according to the girl who worked there) & seeing all the delicious pics on Yelp, I just knew I had to eat here. . . We arrived around 730pm on a Tuesday. There's a kiosk machine where you check-in. You punch in how many people are in your party. Put in your cell number and you'll receive a text telling you to come back and get in line. On the ticket the wait said it was 45 mins but I got a text within 10 mins and we went to stand in line. I estimated we probably waited less than 30 mins. The host said the best time to go is between 4pm - 5pm, food for thought.. . Now on to the food. I really was going to attempt to eat as much protein and seafood as possible. I wasn't going to waste any stomach space on carbs. First station - meat, they had brisket, lamb, spicy sausage and a couple of others I can't remember what they were. I decided to go for the lamb since I never had it before and also the spicy sausage and brisket. I was surprised the lamb was pretty good & not gamey as I thought it would be. Not a fan of it though. The brisket was tender and the spicy sausage was helluva good. Oh I also tried the hamburger sliders which have little sticks on it telling you how it's cooked. Just ate the meat and not the bread lol, it was pretty good.. . Next on to seafood. Went for the crab legs and boy did I pig out on that. I didn't know where they steamed crab legs were until after I ate the cold ones but what the heck went and got them anyway. It's way in the back by the way, near the Japanese section. You give the cook your plate and they sure pile up the crab legs, they aren't stingy either. If I didn't have high cholesterol then I do now. Oh and btw, there's a video on a Yelp showing you how to open the claws. Thank you to the nice person who posted that. My friend kept telling me if I ate a whole plate of crab legs then I got my money's worth and yes I did - twice. . . I also tried the fried chicken and waffles, well just the chicken anyway & it was pretty darn good. The only veggie I tried was the corn on the cob. I decided to try the Tonkotsu Ramen and surprisingly it tasted like something I would get in Japan. It comes in a small bowl and the noodles were cooked perfect. . . So I know y'all are dying to know about the desserts. Well there's a lot. I tried almost everything that was chocolate except for ice cream. I think I was bouncing off the walls from all the sugar. I'm not a dessert person but all desserts looked so stinking good that I just had to try it. They had mini cakes, cup cakes, macaroons, ice cream and they even had mochi ice cream. You name it, they probably had it. . . I will definitely go back here the next time I'm in Vegas. Oh and wear lose clothing, you'll thank me later, lol.
Pretty good buffet. Probably the best in Vegas at the moment. Lines can be long so try going before rush hour. . . Must try are the stone crab claws, crab legs (they serve warm steamed ones by the Italian section), prime rib with extra jus, the veal and oysters. . . Go for the seafood and good meats. Skip the asian and mexican food. It's mediocre and you can get more authentic dishes elsewhere for way less. =)
My first run-in with Bacchanal was a 2.5 hour wait for an expensive Sunday brunch, which we ended up giving up on. Flash forward to a Tuesday evening. There was still a 45-minute wait and the price was $55 for dinner on a weeknight. Fortunately, we were given a ticket to bypass the wait time, but I was still surprised by the price compared to Wicked Spoon. But, I convinced myself that I had to try Bacchanal at least once before forming judgment. . . The "#1 rated buffet in Vegas" failed to live up to its hype on several fronts. Let's start with the good. You're basically paying the price tag for the amazing seafood and carving station options. The crab legs/claws were some of the best I've had at a buffet and I really went to town on the jumbo shrimp. They also had oysters on the half shell, which were mediocre. Several amuse-bouches included a good seafood ceviche, oyster shooter, and a salmon spread. Another winner was the scallops Rockefeller. I found the brioche crust to be perfect. For meats, the prime rib was bloody excellent, and I loved the rack of lamb. Head to the Mexican station to grab freshly-squeezed guava, pineapple, strawberry, or horchata juice served in a bottle on ice. . . Where does this buffet fail? Pretty much everything else. There were some pretty bad dishes including an extremely dry cod and awfully salty BBQ ribs. But, I really didn't like the offering of sushi, pizza, and desserts. If you're paying top dollar, should you really be serving pizza sitting under a heat lamp? How about something different like flatbread? The sushi was pretty much like any other buffet sushi - dried out rice with old-tasting fish. I liked the ice cream offerings, but all the other desserts and pastries tasted stale and dry. . . Forget the stupid ticketing system and heavy wait times. Forget the expensive price. Forget all the disappointing food. I'll take Wicked Spoon or a nice steak dinner any day.
Like any other buffet. Lots of variety to choose from, but food quality was not five stars worthy!
I am never disappointed by this buffet! I can't even name every single item they serve, but let's just say they never disappoint! The perfect time to go is a good 30 minutes before they stop serving breakfast and start serving lunch. You get a little taste of each! Between the red velvet pancakes, sushi, waffles, dessert island, and so much more, there is no way you will leave anything less than satisfied!
my fave buffet spot in Vegas
If you go on Sunday better pay the 20 USD extra to skip the line, it could take hours to get you in. Great food but it's not cool to wait one more line for a slice of meat or bacon.
This place is a solid four stars, we did have the perks of seven stars so we didn't have the long line everyone else went through.  . . The food was fresh, well most of it. Some of the things near the meat station were a little dried out I'm assuming because the line blocked people from seeing what was available.. . We had a really nice meal and the staff was all fast and friendly.
Beautiful buffet with a huge selection, but it's the same old story as with most buffets. They want to give people more options, but flavors are sacrificed. Some of the dishes have something wrong with them. Either too bland, salty, dry, etc. They had the blandest crab that I've ever had at a buffet. . . I would say though that the Asian food selection was delicious. Everything tasted accurate and the variety was unique and numerous. I've never seen roast duck, pho, wonton egg noodle soup, and udon all in one buffet, and they were all tasty. So yummy. Best pho at a buffet that I've ever tasted!. . There are so many dishes that I had never seen at other buffets before like green tea cookies and chicken and waffles. . . Bottom line: Unique options, large layout, but flavors lacking for the most part.
I'll never truly understand why such a vast amount of variety is ever necessary. After sampling approx 15 items then hitting the dessert station,  I can say it is after my 3rd visit to this buffet, a solid 3.5. The first time I was here it was a solid 5 star.  Nothing ever stays as good as it was , when the idea was new and the staff had smiles
Overall not impressed for the price. We even got in for the lunch price as they were switching to dinner selections. Don't get me wrong it's a really nice buffet. But it's a buffet. Very disappointed at the very few "small plate" presentations found during our visit. Vast majority of the food is served in the more traditional communal  "trough of food" style from which you spoon out your portion. The hype I had read led me to believe the majority of the food was prepared nearly to order and that's simply not my experience. For the price I was much more impressed with Wicked Spoon. Had their brunch price of $27, granted no crab legs for brunch but still liked their presentation and their dessert selection better.
I think this a great buffet, I've not tried all of the yet, but from the ones I've tried this is easily number 1 in my books.
the best buffet in town. I can not wait to go back!!! a must go to
