The only reason they get 2 stars is, 1, they make a killer Bloody Mary. 2. The 7 second pint. Drink a Beer in 7 seconds it's free. With that said. Prices are ridiculous. $9 for a Bud Light. Really.  Small cup of mini corn dogs $10.  Our group spent over $350 Sunday and the service was terrible.  High prices can be over looked with good service but we were like invisable as well as server kept forgetting.
It's nice to sit outside on a cool day, but was disappointed with a few things. Service was poorer than expected. My friend had ice tea and I had water and the whole time we didn't get our refills. I actually had to hunt them down to get me more water.. Onion rings are killer great and the only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2. Had lobster Cobb and majority of the lobster meat was stringy innard-like meat which I suspect might be from the tiny legs... There's claw but no tail meat whatsoever. It's really weird. When I buy lobster, I don't even bother outside of the tail and large claw... Seriously couldn't believe they served parts that I throw out.
The food is terrible, I still feel sick to my stomach. We got the "junk chips" and thought that would be a great part of our cheat meal.... Just don't even do it. We also went for the pastrami sliders and I've never had bad pastrami before. I don't know what it was, but I will definitely not eat here again.. Great place for beer, great location, great happy hour and awesome service.. Reconsider if you're thinking about the food. Wish they could change up the menu for some tastier options.
Yuck. Very dissapointed in my 10/2/14 meal. I visited for dinner and to watch the football game.  The service could not have been less inviting and the experince less memorable. The Aria has better dining choices.
This review would have been 5 stars without a doubt except for the exceptionally bad customer service by the hostess. We arrived promptly for our reservation for 8 people, hostess told us she couldn't find the reservation and told us to step aside so she could seat other people. We came from 4 states for a birthday dinner and ended up at 3 separate tables. . The food was exceptional, our waiter was awesome but the hostess totally ruined the celebration for our group. Also everyone noted she was not dressed liked someone representing any classy establishment.. Very seldom do I give a bad review but this one is deserved.
Would have been five stars for us if they hadn't lost our reservations. (Rude never works) . To the restaurants credit they were able to accommodate our group of eleven.. This was the best dinner we had in Vegas and I want to go back. Fresh oysters, fish and chips and my favorite Hangar 1 vodka.. Thanks to manager to help us feel welcome . That's points!
if it wasnt for the bartender Janelle then this would get 0 stars! we go for MNF and are told sliders are 3 bucks each...fine. then the waiter asks do u want fries so i figure they should be coming with or a special for happy hour but no! lol...3 sliders are 9 bucks and the fries were also 9 bucks! the waiter failed to disclose that in which he wanted to up the bill. Horrible and sneaky service by our waiter. We left at halftime  and will never be back.
Music was so load you couldn't talk to the person next to you.  Food was fair and way over seasoned and over priced.  I ordered roasted turkey and couldn't even eat it with the amount of salt on it.  With the amount of places to eat in Vegas not sure I would return.  A disappointment since P.U.B was always on of my favoirtes.
They have a pretty good beer selection.  We also did the "7 second challenge", drink a pint in seven seconds and get it for free.  3 out of 4 of us were successful!  It was kind of a fun thing to do at the bar.  We tried the duck steamed buns and thought they were pretty good, a little too sweet for my liking but good overall.  The one thing that I really dislike at places is the bathroom attendants.  I can get my own soap and towel and don't need to feel pressured into tipping for those things.
Decent pub food with a pretty solid staff!  I was in Vegas for 3 days and stayed at the Aria.  I found myself at the Todd English Pub quite a few times during my stay and can't say I regret any of them.  Be prepared to pay typical Vegas prices, but you should receive good service!
Great place to watch the games. Love the bartender and his customer service. Great recommendation on lobster roll.
Service is non existent. Prices exceed New York prices.   Food is horrible.  Other than that is is ok.
We walk in they tell us they r no longer serving food.... only the bar. It's 11pm. We go to order drinks. The bar tender was rude just took our order and walked away and started talking to 3 people. I look at the menu and it says happy hour till midnight with food. I ask them about it and they said it depends on volume. Here's an idea... put an asterisk on the menu stating that. Looks like they might have good food but I will never know cause I will never come back here and neither should you. We finally got our drinks went and sat on the patio. We saw several people come in and immediately leave. many of them talking to there friends about what I put in this message. Owner needs to find a new manager.
ok, as far as pubs go, this is a great place to have a beer or two. i recommend  you try to  down a beer in seven seconds (with a standing egg timer attached to the bar) and get a freebie (free is good, yes)?. . however, if you are a paying customer, purchasing food, you will be greatly disappointed. we were a party of five and not one of our group could eat their meal. i had (actually i didn't) the shepard's pie, which any respectable shepard wouldn't eat. the plate was an oil covered mess and was in-eatable! the same goes for the fish and chips, the stale pretzels and everything else presented here. and good luck finding your waitress to complain. i think they retreat into a bomb shelter in preparation for the numerous complaints this place has to be receiving. . . this place should be renamed todd english's "greasy spoon"
This place was really nice. I got the duck legs and wife got the lobster rolls. Both very yummy. Plus got a free beer when I did this Yelp review. It's kinda hard to find and get to but worth the trip. Not your typical pub but the food options were great!
