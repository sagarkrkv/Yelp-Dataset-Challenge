My friends and I visited the Le Village Buffet twice, once for dinner and the second was for breakfast, due in part because we purchased the Buffet of Buffets pass. After reading some tips in regards to the buffet of buffets my friends and I decided that the Le Village Buffet and the Spice Market Buffet were the only 2 buffets worth visiting. . . The Le Village Buffet definitely feels like a Vegas buffet. The interior resembles a small French village that successfully makes you believe that you've been transported to another country, but that is as French as it gets. Once you see the entrees offered you'll realize that the Le Village Buffet is just like any other Vegas buffet, with the exception of a full packed crepe station. Luckily the food at the Le Village Buffet is cooked very well.. . Breakfast:. When we came for breakfast, my friends and I were excited to try some authentic crepes. Unfortunately the majority of the crepes offered were a let down. I tried a berry filled crepe, a banana nutella crepe, a ham and cheese crepe, and lastly a green onion chicken crepe. Out of the 4 the best was the banana nutella crepe and my least favorite was the green onion chicken crepe (I'd actually recommend not even ordering the green onion chicken crepe).. . The other breakfast items offered were delicious. I strongly recommend grabbing an eggs benedict, (the hollandaise sauce was light but not overpowering, unlike the Spice Markets benedict which was unappetizing, due to the strong mayonaise taste), the carved ham was cooked to perfection, and the maple syrup polenta was simply too good. I'd avoid the bacon slab, which is basically a large thick cut of bacon; there was just too much fat and it was way too salty. . . Dinner:. Just a FYI, there's literally no special French entrees, so just keep that in mind when coming here for dinner. Overall the dinner items offered are very good. There's a good variety of selections, with the carving station being the highlight. The prime rib was moist and tender, and topping it off with some aju only made it better. I'd stay away from the crab legs though, they didn't seem very fresh and one of my friends actually left a little sick. Other than that the rest of dinner items offered were quite good.. . Overall I'd definitely come back to Le Village Buffet, and if I do get the buffet of buffets pass again then I'll probably visit only this buffet, unless you purchase the premium buffets.  To good eatings :)
"A-Ok" if you come on a groupon deal and just want to chow down on some sliced snow crab legs with minimal effort while downing a bottle of wine included in the deal.. . This place used to be on the elite end of buffets a while back alongside Bellagio, but they too have joined the ranks of mediocrity.. . The prime rib was overdone and nothing special (buffet at Aria still has the best buffet prime rib).. . The highlight of the meal would be the crepe station at the end, but forget getting a "savory" crepe that would have cheese meat and veggies as the lady cooking the crepe is in such a rush to get your crepe done and go on to the next, that the cheese inside the crepe hasn't melted even 1%...it's like eating a fork full of shredded cheese out of a bag at the supermarket...so go for the sweet crepe for dessert and skip the savory as any part of your meal.. . Everything else wasn't worth mentioning. . . The ambiance is nice but the food has really slipped. I would kick myself for paying full price.
If not for their desert area, Paris buffet would have got two stars. Made to order crepe station is best part of this buffet along with their colorful macaroons.. . Quality have gone down tremendously through the year.  Either that, or I have outgrown my taste for buffet.. . No selection of food besides sausages and mollusks. Had like 5 different kind of sausages and 4 different kind of mollusks  based entrees such as clams and mussels.
There was something missing. I cAnt put my finger on it. I wasn't satisfied with the food. I wasn't satisfied with the service, I just didn't feel like I had an overall satisfying experience at this buffet compared to other buffets I have visited in the past.
Just wanted to confirm my 5 star rating :). . Came back for dinner this time and it was just as good. I think it was about $35 for Sunday night dinner, which is not bad considering how pricey some of the other ones can get. Of course, you can go to ones that are cheaper, but those are just straight up disgusting and not even worth the cheapness. I think this is a good moderately priced buffet for a good quality meal. . . I'm not gonna name everything I ate, but everything I did eat was delicious. I especially liked the salmon! YUM! I'm always a fan if the fish isn't dry.. . Overall, a good quality, but moderately priced buffet to go to.
My husband and I went here for breakfast. It was good, excellent selection, especially choices of different types of eggs, waffles, crepes, etc. I would not say, that quality was over the top but selection was good, price was reasonable. I would come back again
Everything was delicious! Lots of options and literally everything I had was delicious.
This is an excellent buffet. The reason I only gave it 3 stars? They advertised crab, but when I asked for crab only found a nasty, messy ice pit of broken crab shells. However.... Just before I left, I noticed a gentleman at the table next to us feasting on a huge bowl of HOT STEAMING CRAB LEGS. I asked our waitress what's the deal, she replied it was a VIP gambler, only VIP's get the hot crab. Excuse me? I just dropped almost $100 for two people and I don't get the steamed crab? Wow. Ripoff. Not cool. Other than this glaring defect we enjoyed most of the other items, good tasting sauces on some of the chicken items, the meatballs and a couple other items. Spend a few more bucks and go to Ceasars Bacchanal buffet, my current favorite and a supreme feast for about $50.
We came back here twice! Our server was a singer and really an entertaining gem. She reminded me of a really cheerful Bella from Beauty & the Beast only black :) . The food: $31. for dinner   Carving station rocked perfectly cooked, prime rib, turkey, duck, & pork wrapped something really tasty???  Crab legs were cut open in half so no fighting with them and they weren't dried out, seafood was tasty, great variety of sausages, and sides. They had a cheese station and like 7 -8 different rolls. Desserts were out of this world! Sushi was great, crepes were made to order yummm! My only complaint couldn't get a martini :(  With all the choices we had we went back a 2nd time.
The food is pretty good.  they have just about everything here, except Bathrooms.  Big bummer.   Drink service is sort of slow.   Overall good tho
This used to be one of the top two or three buffets in Vegas. While it's still good, it's starting to feel the effects of downsizing the number of options it serves, and I can't quite put it in the same tier as the buffets at Caesar's, Bellagio, or Wynn.. . What they serve is usually pretty good. I remember they did a tri-tip one night that was absolutely excellent, and their prime rib never disappoints. They also get points for a very good dessert section.. . If you get the Buffet of Buffets deal (which I'd advise; if you eat at more than one buffet in 24 hours, it pays for itself), or are just in the neighborhood, this is a pretty solid lunch or dinner option (haven't eaten breakfast here, so I can't comment on that). Unfortunately, it used to be GREAT, and it isn't anymore.
We went for champagne brunch on Saturday. We were seated almost right away. The food was excellent, as were the drinks, and while it didn't have the same selection as some of the other buffets, it was still tasty and filling! Our waitress was super attentive and very polite. All in all, we left satisfied and very happy having spent our money there!
I've been here twice in the last two years. Food quality and service sucked both times. Their crab legs were a one star as well as the rest.This is definitely not a top 10 las vegas buffet.  Trust me, save the real estate in your stomach for one of the top five buffets. Come here only if you are desperately hungry and can't wait to get to another nearby casino buffet. To the chefs and management of this place: get your act together, this is an embarrassment.
One of my fav brunch spots on the Strip. Love the crepe bar where you can get fresh made to order crepes. Food selection is huge, and great quality. Never disappointed here. We usually get the 24 hr buffet pass for $50, which includes this buffet and many other on the strip at Caesar properties. If you want to check out a few of the Vegas buffets, definitely the best way to go.
This is my first time to Las Vegas, and quite honestly, probably my last. I'm not a gambler but I did find some things to enjoy. This buffet had a few negative reviews, mostly centered around peoples' expectations or their service. Well, I figured out the secret - if you have a large group, reserve ahead of time on Open Table (at least a day or so).  I came solo on a business trip, had no wait, and fantastic service. I overheard the waitstaff talking and the area I was seated in is referred to as VIP - reason being, I tipped and was polite. . . Food wise, there are some fantastic options. My favorites were the truffle oil Mac and cheese, the fresh roast beef, stuffed lamb, and the sauteed mushrooms. They have crab legs, but they are cold and I didn't see a means to warm them on the buffet itself. There is a $12.99 all you can drink special (that's alcohol, folks) - so if that's your thing it's absolutely worth it. . . I enjoyed my time at La Village and would definitely return.
