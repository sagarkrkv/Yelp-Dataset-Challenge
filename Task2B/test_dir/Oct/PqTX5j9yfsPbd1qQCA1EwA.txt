I was beyond disappointed with this club. It was our first time partying in Vegas and everyone said that Tao was the place to go, and I seriously disagree. Unless you pay the money necessary to get table service and whatnot, you're crammed onto an exceptionally small stage where there's no room to  turn around, let alone move your body. I wouldn't recommend this club unless you get table service, because that's the only way you'll enjoy being crammed into this club.
Consistently one of the best clubs in Vegas. Everybody was gracious and easy going. Very accommodating. Breezed through the the line with a presale ticket like always.. . They get bonus points because I left my credit card there the night before, and had it waiting for me at the top of the morning. . . I love Tao. Thanks a bunch.
If you call and place a reservation on the guest list all you have to do is arrive there before midnight and you can get in for free to this amazing club!!!. . We took a cab there and when we arrived we were directed upstairs where we went through a line that moved effortlessly fast and the bouncers were very polite and professional we got into the actual club within being at the Venetian Hotel in under five minutes.. . The inside of the club is beautiful they have a restaurant downstairs and a night club upstairs that is huge and beautifully decorated with an Asian Buddhist theme.. . The DJ was consistent and playing good music, the energy was amazing and even though the drinks are ridiculously priced ($15 for A cranberry vodka?) you can't really complain especially if you get in for free.. . Overall this was one of the best nightclubs I've ever been to and has blown away anything I've ever experienced in downtown Los Angeles and I plan on making frequent visits to this nightclub with my fiance very soon again. Bravo.
This review is for my visit during March 2013 so I don't know if things have changed. But I had such a great experience at Tao that I would regret not writing a review. I have to acknowledge the bouncers I dealt with. My friend I went with got stupid drunk at Tao and she had trouble going down the flight of stairs when we were leaving. Two bouncers came and carefully led her down. They didn't look mean and were not impatient with my drunk friend at all. The bouncers helped carry her outside and asked if she was going to be ok when I said I could take her the rest ofthe way. . . After I have dealt with many rude bouncers at other no-name clubs it was refreshing to have a good experience from everyone, even the bouncers!  The above isn't the only great example I experienced from those guys.  Hopefully the rest can learn from these  gentlemen.
I went here for a party... cool place.  I'm not a nightclub person, but it was nice.  I loved the Tao Beach, which is upstairs, outside.  Lots of places to sit and relax throughout the club.  Drinks were ok - I downgraded one star because they don't seem to know how to make a lemon drop.  Who puts it in a regular glass with ice!?!? weird (not in a good way).  Food was tasty.  They make awesome potstickers.  Yum.
This place came highly recommended and was such a disappointment. Towards the end of the night, my friend accidentally knocked into a staff member and after she apologized to him, he responded rudely by calling her a b***** among other things. I found this excessively disrespectful and went to the security manager to file a complaint. Well I'm not sure if it was because I had a drink in my hand or because they believed we were just two stupid girls but they proceeded to escalate the situation, define it as an altercation, and kick US out, escorting us through the sketchy back hall ways of the Venetian (which did not feel remotely safe) even after we offered to simply leave. The best part? Not a word was said to the rude staff member- they played dumb and pretended they had no idea who we were describing. Great way to treat the customers at your extremely over-priced club, Tao staff. We will be returning later in the day to file a formalized complaint with management.
Probably the worst club i have been to in a long time. I live in San Diego and there is about 5 clubs in San Diego that are better than this place. to get ANYWHERE you have to be VIP. There is literally no point in going unless you are VIP. Because the people that arent VIP are all dudes. so unless you want to be crammed on a cute little dance floor all night with dudes while all the hotties are up on this completely raised floor dancing by themselves, dont go here. we left within 45 minutes.. the music was quiet too, which was odd?
Have been to Tao numerous times. and WOW- it went to the gutter. .  Did VIP and not only were the bottles over priced vs the VIP we did the night before- the service was drab and negative.  The bussers were rude and bumped into you constantly without saying pardon me etc.  The waitress didnt smile nor did any other waitress.  No customer service at all- Sorry but if you pay 4500 Its logical to expect some damn good service!   Seems no one is happy here.. Last observation.  Watch out for the low class scumbags!   Not exactly sure why but this was the first time Ive experienced racial hostility.   Two separate occasions  two separate couples of a certain minority status attempted to instigate a fight.  I find that a little odd.  Both couples were of the same race and lets just say they werent there to have fun but cause drama.   Beautiful venue, but unfortunately the service sucks as do the crowds that pollute the environment.  This was the first negative experience Ive ever had in Vegas, and it was all at TAO.  Good Luck
not a bad place.. they let us up not he tops of the booths to dance and they let us in easy.. got not the guest list.. Fun music.. staff was nice.. bartenders nice.. good drinks.. I suggest going early.. it gets PACKEDDDD about 12am!
One of my favorite places on my visit. The food was very good - heavy hors d'oeuvres - the Kobe sliders were the best. The staff was attentive and kept tables cleared and fresh food coming out. . . The dance floor and DJ were very nice.  The ambiance was pleasant as well. A sprawling club and restaurant worth plenty of options both inside and or for entertaining. It was unique to me and I really like unique!
Worst place ever! Rude staff and the absolute worst security! The head of security has a superiority complex! How he treated me was uncalled for. Having several security guards man handle a woman on her bachelorette night is beyond ridiculous! Understandable if I was violent but getting kicked out for getting hugs and crying for being emotional from wedding planning after only being in the club for 30 minutes stupid. Kicking me out with none of my belongings and not telling my friends my where abouts. Even when my fiance found out and skipped his bachelor party to come find me they wouldn't tell him! Thanks to these morons I was hand cuffed paraded around the Venetian, I had bruises on my arms and wrists on my wedding day. I will never forgive this place of what humiliation they put me through! Do not go to this club especially if you're a woman! Oh and I also spent $3000 for VIP... To get kicked out after 30 minutes for being emotional! If it was an option it would be negative stars! DO NOT GO HERE!
As a lady, this club was quite the experience. . . Me and three other lady friends went to a late dinner at the restaurant. It was pricey, but the food was good. While we were eating, the club promoter scoped us out and came over to invite us to the club as VIPs complete with a free cocktail hour. We didn't pay for drinks all night. After the cocktail hour was over, the club promoter poured us drinks. As the night progressed, we joined a bachelor party's bottle service. A probably noxiously expensive glass of Veuve Clicquot? Don't mind if I do. My friends and I had a blast. As VIPs we were shielded from the insane crowd, but still got to dance and have a good time. As we were leaving, the bouncers handed us VIP tickets to TAO Beach (the day club) and I got a ticket for free VIP and bottle service for NYE. Score! I'm not sure how I feel about how LV clubs use us ladies as traps to get the men to spend mucho dinero, but all in all we had a great time.
Went to see Kim Kardashian at Tao on Friday 10/24. Showed up around 9:45pm used our promoters name got in right away no waiting!!!! Drinks were expensive $18 for a Pineapple-Grey Goose, I didn't expect anything less. The staff there told us Kim was showing up around 12am & she didn't get there till 2:30ish she looked beautiful as always. Kanye, Kim, Khloe, Johnathan the whole crew showed up & all looked stunning! We got great pictures and totally worth the wait! the dj here was also AMAZING!! We danced until they closed! I defiantly recommend this place!
