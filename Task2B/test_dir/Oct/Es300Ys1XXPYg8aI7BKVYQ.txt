Even though XS is not new anymore, it's still one of my favorite clubs to go to!
This place is pretty freaking nice. Considering its my first club in Vegas this sets a pretty high bar for the rest. I'm used to clubbing in NYC but the clubs here are meh while Vegas on the whole seems pretty elaborate and on the whole better. Certainly more space here at least. XS is one of the largest clubs, and the outdoor section with a pool and jacuzzi is really nice and they also have blackjack tables set up WHILE David Guetta was performing. We were able to go inside since we had an all access pass, tons of tables, and the stage is decent sized considering they need to divide up the stage, table area, and walk paths. I don't know much about how much tables cost but i hear it can go from 2-4k.
If I could give ZERO stars I would!!! Do NOT pre-pay your tickets on want tickets.com it means NOTHING. Their staff is incompetent and don't know where lines are.. . We prepaid for 3 guys and 3 girls and were given the run around for where to go. When we finally found the right entrance we were told the girls can go in but guys will be an additional $20 to get. WTF the guys already paid $30. Not to mention we were put in the regular line of people who did not pay. . . We have been here plenty of times before and have NEVER had this horrible of service. I will never come to XS again and will tell everyone I know to stay away from the establishment. . . Want tickets.com is a fraud and does nothing to enhance the shitty service you receive at the club!
Every one should hit up Michelle for any guest list.  Her # is (908) 770-3570.  She is amazing!
Was just here last night, and this might be my favorite nightclub so far. The view of pool is awesome, the DJ kept everyone moving, and there are plenty of bars so they never get too packed. My only complaint is that the bouncers outside were a bit rude But I guess they deal with drunk people on a daily basis, so I'll cut them some slack. Also, shout out to Michelle, my new favorite promoter, for getting my friend and I in for free and 2 free drinks each. Definitely contact her if you're interested in going! (908) 770-3570
The promoter Michelle for XS nightclub was great! She got us on the VIP entry guest list with hardly no line! Thanks Michelle! Until the next fun trip to Vegas! 908-770-3570
This was an amazing club! Lots of space to accommodate many people and Michelle gave us a great hookup on VIP!!! :)) 908-770-3570!
I love going to XS, the layout is incredible and the music never disappoints. However this past Saturday, I didn't have a good time. The unknown artist played songs from all different eras and after an hour my girls and I rushed out of there quickly to Hakkasan. Anyways... Looking forward to coming back with my awesome bestie.
Saw Diplo at the venue. Great sound, small venue, some people would call it intimate. Do not get me wrong I enjoy dancing shoulder to shoulder with people when the music is hot. Sure my girlfriends butt gets touched every once in awhile. The security were professional and on it...  The female servers on the other hand are maybe working too hard, but they have attitude and one of them almost got my cousin arrested.  . So this is the story, two servers are walking together and the blonde servers squeezes her Co-workers (the brunettes) butt. The brunette turns to our group points at my cousin, yells at him then starts calling security. Her blonde Co-worker first looks like she is trying to tell her that she is one who goosed her. But the brunettes not having it, and security is called. I ask security if they are walking my cousin out, again security was completely professional and they advise, that they got to kick him out.... We walk to the front, the manager just advises my cousin he has to leave, no charges pressed. . . The server could really ruined my cousin life if they decided to press charges on something he never did. Again the venue was nice, security was cool...possibly would not go again since the whole experience left a bitter taste to my night #Vegas #xs #diplo
Had an amazing time here and it was all thanks to Michelle. I was staying in Vegas for the weekend and wasn't too sure what club to hit. I got Michelle's number from a friend and wow was I amazed by the fast response and all the hook ups she was able to provide. She got promoters for me and set me up with VIP entry to XS. Super nice and knows how to get stuff done fast. If you are visiting and want to hit the nightclubs especially XS contact Michelle for all your needs. (908) 770-3570.. . XS has great visuals and always has good music/DJs. If you're ready to have a good time and be surrounded by lots of girls come here!!
XS is the most hit-or-miss location I've been to. Their performers? Top of the A-list: Zedd, Avicii, you name it. The atmosphere? Fun, wild, lots of hot young people. Dated interior that needs updating, and feels really cramped, especially when they block off the exit to the outside area. The tables are clustered together awkwardly mostly in one corner, which feels separated from the action. . Security needs to step up their game here, as the crowd-pushing gets seriously insane. I don't know how they manage to better control crowds at other Vegas clubs, but they need to have a workshop with XS. In addition, the bouncers are straight-up hostile. I understand they deal with a LOT of bs, but when I'm minding my own business and simply trying to wait in line with my legal ID to get into a club, I don't really want to be interrogated.
Worst experience ever. Xs is super strict. Me and my friends went in around 11:00pm, we were celebrating for a friend bday, and We got a table and as soon as I go in they checked my id and my friends id. Im 25 and when they saw my id they said okay u can go in. My friend is 22 and they took her id away cause they thought it was a fake, then they took my id away cause they thought it was a fake too.. . Me and my friend tried to get our id back but they kept telling us to call the cops. I tried to call the cops and they kicked us out and detained me and hand cuffed me for not listening to them. Took the cop 2 hrs later to come by to tell them my id card was real. . . Got no apology what so ever and on top of that they gave me a ticket for trespassing just cause I wanted my id back. Now I have to go back to vegas and go to court to fight the ticket. The 2 ppl who detained name was D Brown and bob, so beware if you see them.
Very fun and tasteful venue!  Open back wall to the pool area so not your typical claustrophobic nightclub. Great place to go out with your friends to mingle and dance!  Drinks are a little pricey, but that's Las Vegas. We worked with club promoter Michelle to get in/get table reservations. She was great and her info is: Instagram: Michelle_vegasnightlife, Facebook: Facebook.com/Michelle.vivalasguestlist, Phone:  908-770-3570. She'll hook you up!
Had the best time here. Great experience. I got a cabana and was worth every penny. Have to enjoy a bottle of ciroc. This is by far my favorite club. Zedd was performing and was really good. This is a must if you go to vegas
I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I went here, but I did and it was a great experience. I came here to see Zedd DJ with some friends. We were able the by pass the line and that really added to the experience. I couldn't imagine waiting in a ridiculously long line paying $55 for cover and then dropping some money on booze. Anyway, this club is crowded like no other. There's no room to move once you're inside. The club part isn't all that big however since it's indoor/outdoor it's much better than I expecting being a non-clubbing person. You can also reserve outdoor tables or cabanas if you're wanting to spending at least $1,500 on bottle service. I can think of better things to spend my money, but to each their own. Anyway, we arrived around 11ish and Zedd didn't appear until 1:37am there was a lot of waiting but what an experience once he did come on. The crowd came alive and it was just crazy. He DJ'ed for 2 hours and the crowd went wild for him. You never know what the crowd is going to be like. The crowd was tolerable but less than ideal. Lots of drunk sloppy people and obnoxious people that bump into you repeatedly.
LOVE LOVE LOVE the place... We were let in easy.. (we were staying at the Wynn) Music was fun! Love the night swim and the regular club.. we will be going again!
The night club was awesome. We had 10 people go there with us for my daughters 21st Birthday and we were all from California. Here's what I'm really disappointed about. We all arrived there Friday 10/17/2014 @ 10:15pm . We had checked their website and it said on Fridays it was $30 for men and $20 for woman, when we got there they said It was $35 for men and $25 for woman. That's not even the worse part of it, I really didn't care and wasn't going to argue about it. The bad part is, the line was so short and in fact, there was only 8 people ahead of us and it took us over an hour before they let us in. The Gate keeper I would call him came over and told us if we wanted to tip the host $20 per male they would let us in right now and at this point there was only 4 people in front of us. So if we paid this extra $20, we would be @ $430 instead of $310 just to get in the front door. Then at there desertion, they would let people go straight in with no wait or maybe they just had more money than our group and could pay the $'s needed to skip the line. The good part is, that once we got in we spent over $1,000 in drinks and had a blast. The sad part is I would never go back to this club because of there greed. I mean really, you would think that they would be happy you picked their Club for a special night for our daughters 21st and that we traveled all the way from California. When I told the Gate Keeper that it was my daughters 21st, he didn't even seem to care one bit. When we go to Las Vegas for my next daughters 21st, I will make sure if we go to this Club again we contact someone there that actually appreciates your business. People running this club will end up costing the owners money and maybe they already make so much that they really don't care. Great Club, poor Gate Keepers..
Appearance. WYNN BEST CLUB EVER! . Hands down, XS gave me the most fun at a club than any other I've experienced.  Im not new to the club scene so this is a compliment. Two night before I was st Drie's After Dark at the Cromwell on the strip. . This was MUCH better.  The club is large had a outdoor pool in the back and a multi tiered area inside.  The night I went DJ GREEN LANTERN was spinnng the top hiphop and trap music.. Green Lantern shut down the club..  ppl from ALL background dancing singing drinking and having a good time. No fights not knuckle heads... lots of beautiful ppl.. A most go. . Price. $25 WOMEN. $30MEN. . Drinks are pricy... a beer was $10. Lord!
It's a very nice casino ! Club XS wax fun & sexy . I would definitely make plans to stay at Encore next visit around to Vegas.  I really like the decor and the gaming tables are newer.  They have Chanel shop , a live jazz lounge area, but the XS Club music is more to my taste
I have always had a blast when going to XS. This is one of the first clubs that I truly had a good time at when coming to Vegas! Everything about this place is super nice! You could get into this place even if you've only got a group of guys! The music is always good and drunk folks seem to like jumping into the pool lol! The only other place that I've been to in recent times that I could put over XS would be Drai's! BUT, XS is still definitely my top TO-GO to place if you're trying to party out in Vegas. For some reason, the ratio of girls to guys always evens out here! I've never seen it turn into a cockfest with way too many guys here.
Probably 3.5 stars.. . PROMOTER: Since XS has fallen a little from the clubbing scene, I figured it would be easy to get in for free with both guys and girls.  I texted Paul C (858-245-6055) and he said as long as I had twice as many girls than guys the guys would get in for free.  He was very informative keeping me updated with texts and making sure I knew where the entrance was (we entered through Brahms Ballroom) and even got the girls free drink tickets! We had 6 girls and 2 guys.. . PARKING: If you're driving, park in the Encore self park lot, not the Wynn.  If you park in the Wynn self park lot you'll end up at Surrender, and have to walk across, past the check in and go all the way down until you see the Encore self park lot and the back entrance to XS.  I still do not know where Encore self park is because when I was driving down the strip all I saw was Wynn self park.. . WAIT: The promoter said we had to get in by 11pm to get everyone for free.  I was a little worried about the line but we got to the back entrance at 10:45 and there was no line! We went in right away and got into the club.. . ATMOSPHERE: People said it had an outdoor and indoor area but on a Friday night the pool was roped off so we could only dance on the inside area and then walk along the pool near the bottle service tables.  The inside was pretty nice, with a baseball shaped room.  There were rounded bottle service booths lining the side and then the dance floor coming into a V in the middle with on DJ.  Only one room, but it is semi-open so there was a lot of air flowing and it wasn't that sweaty! In fact, I didn't get hot at all.. . DRINKS: They gave us free drink tickets (which don't work for certain drinks) but they were pretty good.  Water was FREE, which was great too.  . . MUSIC: We saw Wolfgang Gartner play and he actually came on around 1am and was pretty good.  The DJ before him was pretty good too, but it's pretty much all EDM so if you're not into that you won't like it.  It wasn't super crowded so that was nice because you could actually dance and not get elbowed in the face.. . Although XS isn't as popular as it used to be, I wanted to check out the club everyone said was amazing.  It was fun and the venue was nice, but I wish there was a hip hop room and that we could venture in the pool area.
Late review, but here it is... A much better experience at XS than Drai's Nightclub, which we went to on a Thursday night. . . Cover was pretty much the same as Drai's, $30 for Guys and $20 for the Ladies, however they do have promoter specials that allows a girl to bring a guy in with no charge (1:1).  . . The bartenders here were friendly, fast and smiled!  The drinks were reasonably priced, $12 for rail drinks, $15 for premium.  We didn't order any shot or beers at this location, so no prices for you guys.... . The crowd seemed younger, more chill and not so uptight, making this place a lot more fun and easier to mingle and socialize.  BUT if you want an EDM style dance floor, go to Drai's.. . Overall this place was MUCH better in ways of prices, customer service, and bathroom cleanliness.
Bought tickets, still had to bribe bouncers to get in. Fuck that.
I have been to XS multiple times before and always had a great time, but there are clearly some shady people going there now. I was there this past Friday and had my purse with me on the dance floor and had my iphone stolen out of it. This happened to 3 other girls from my group throughout the night and 6 or 7 other girls not in our group as well. We contacted XS about the situation and they said Wynn security would look into it, but apparently this has happened a few times in the past so I don't know how hard they're really investigating this. We are filing a police report with the local police, but I think that XS should really put more effort into stopping incidences like this because I always have so much fun at their club and don't want to stop going because of shady people there.
Place is awful. I was excited to go here because its world known...what a letdown. We went to see Deadmau5 recently and the sound system was horrible. The inside room had two speakers BLOWN. BLOWN SPEAKERS IN A CLUB OF THIS MAGNITUDE (and price)?????? The outside area wasn't dialed in either. So far Drai's and Marquee are my Vegas go-to's.
