The pool was awesome,  however,  the hotel was a disappointment.  We went here to get married, the employees were rude snd the restaurants were over priced,  even for Vegas.  We spent most of our time nex door at the mirage.  But the pool was good.
I stayed at Treasure Island the weekend of August 15-17 for the first time and I must say that they have excellent customer service. I fogot over $600 worth of gift cards in the drawer upon checkout and housekeeping returned them to lost and found and the gift cards have since been returned to me in California. I doubted that they would be returned but to my surprise there are still good people and great service providers out there.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! House keeping and valet services was prompt even though there were ample events going out at the hotel. The Pool/Cabana area is live with great music and the rooms are modern yet cozy. My only gripe which prohibtted me from giving 5 stars is that the only place to eat after about 2pm is at the Coffee House and the line was extremely long.
I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! . . Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! . . On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. . . And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!
Absolutely my worst Vegas experience yet and TI Vegas risk management and hotel management are to blame! I would give negative stars if I could! . . This place is NOT SAFE!!! I came back to my room with my wife & her two friends after attending a wedding that evening to a scroungey smoking male leaving OUR ROOM with a black sack full of OUR BELONGINGS! Apparently security had been called on this "suspect fellow" 20 min prior and they were IN THE HALL as the man proceeded to ATTACK me and grab me by the throat and then run into the Service Elevator Room and escape through the SERVICE ELEVATORS.... ALL IN FRONT OF SECURITY, WHO WALKED SLUGGISHLY TO US! They didn't even jog!!! And their response to us being attacked and robbed in front of them was to offer to write a report "if we wanted to"!!! OF COURSE WE WANTED TO. And then they continued to try to talk us out of calling the Police, which we ignored and called ourself to file a report with the police. . . Absolutely sketchy and unnacceptable! And on top of it all, management refused to compensate our rooms for the nights stay!! Never coming back, I like my safety more!
Never again. I have one positive for our stay but that does not out weight the list of negatives. The positive a suite with two bathrooms. Now all the things that are wrong. The bed is old so old that at a 130 lbs I was sinking that shouldn't happen. Plus there was some rather questionable stains on the headboard, cleanliness doesn't seem to be important here. The service for the restaurants was a notch below mediocre. The seafood shack the worse food and service in this place. I miss the old restaurant that use to be there but then again I miss what the treasure island use to be years ago. Now it's a place that needs a full overhaul top to bottom inside and out staff included. The absolute worse part was the location of our room. We paid for a suite and with suite prices I expect something a little more. Not sleeping one block away from a train that goes all night long. And blows the horn right outside the window. Wtf I have never been so tired on a vacation before. This hotel is small, dark, and just getting older. Stay here if you have no other option otherwise look elsewhere for a nice trip.
This past weekend my friends and I had an awful experience at TI. Our weekend was wonderful expect for being robbed and assaulted in the hotel. Upon arriving back to our room a homeless looking man who was smoking came rushing out of our room. As he tried to flee he grabbed my friend's husband by the neck and pushed him out of the way leaving some cuts and a bruised handprint on his neck. The man escaped through the service elevator. The man stole wallets, credit cards, cash, giftcards, some jewelry, and alcohol. The main disappointment is not the items that were taken but rather the lack of security and safety at this hotel. According to our hotel neighbors there had already been a complaint to security about this odd looking man roaming the halls yet he was never caught. Secondly, we will never stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone due to how the hotel management handled the situation. The hotel tried to talk us out of filing a police report, still made us pay for our stay at the hotel, and were simply not nice and unapologetic. Lastly, there was no communication between security and management about the incident which added to frustration. I do not recommend this hotel.
I would give this place NEGATIVE STARS if I could. I had the most horrific experience at the Treasure Island Hotel. Upon returning to our hotel room at Treasure Island after attending a wedding, at approximately 12:30am, a disturbing man was exiting OUR HOTEL ROOM with our bottle of vodka, a black laundry bag full of our valuables, and some sort of keycard. When my friends husband confronted him, the man grabbed him by the neck and pushed him against the wall and tried to escape through the door to the SERVICE ELEVATORS. I felt terrified for our safety and was worried that someone would get more hurt. We did not know if this guy could have a weapon and I trusted that security would jump in and help us stop this man. However when I looked down the hallway to see the security while the man was STILL IN THE HALLWAY AND THE ATTACK WAS TAKING PLACE, the security team was WALKING, not running, but WALKING towards us allowing the man to get away with all of our things. I felt completely unsafe and helpless. This man COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED had the security team taken a dangerous situation seriously and had its guests best interest at heart. By the time the security team WALKED down the hallway to reach us, the man was gone. They proceeded to try and talk us out of filing a report with the police and said we can just file a report with the hotel "IF WE WANTED TO". The next morning, we went to the front desk to try and be compensated for our room and there was no note of the incident that had been recorded on our reservation. SKETCHY!! They refused to reimburse anything but resort fees at $24.99/night. When my friend claimed that this was unacceptable, the on duty manager, Christopher Sheehan, threatened to call security and have her kicked out of the hotel for raising her voice in front of guests. People have the right to know how UNSAFE Treasure Island Hotel is and how poorly they treat their guests, as well as the lack of communication, action, and seriousness of dangerous situations. Treasure Island DOES NOT TAKE CARE OF ITS GUESTS or provide a safe environment. DO NOT give them your business and choose ANY OTHER HOTEL.
Since ditching the pirate theme, TI is hotel with identity crisis.  Not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures & loud A/C.  spa is a joke which have to pay $17 extra.  Only plus is good location.  Stay at Rio for $50 Less and much better room
try to check in 5 minutes early, the fee is $40.. Ask for a half hour more than 11am checkout.. Fee is $40. Rooms average with small tv. Slots bad. Rude service at restaurants and hotel check in. Crowded and very smoky. They tack on a $25 resort fee each day whether you use it or not.. Coffee is $3.95 a cup. Buffet way overpriced and crappy. Not like other Vegas buffets.. Most guests are either overseas Italians or drunken kids... The language in most places in the Casino is worse than docks in NYC where I once worked.. Just a sampler folks.. Avoid
If you want to pay WAY more than elsewhere or your boss and The Company is paying, then this is your place to stay On The Strip.. . Treasure Island is a very nice Strip hotel.  Sweet lobby.  Just, I didn't see it, how much more they charged than elsewhere for what is only JUST NICE caliber.
The valet parking was slick.  Just make sure that you have everything you need from the car.  You cannot go to your car once it is checked in.  Someone will go for you.  When you leave, tip $5-10 when they deliver your car.  The front staff were friendly and the check-in was easy.  Our King deluxe room was very nice, but the edges of the carpet had not been vacuumed.  Also, there was lots of grunge on the toilet tank where the lid meets the tank.  Probably never been cleaned.  The room was advertised for $57.09 but after the Resort Fee and taxes, the final bill came to $85.09.  A resort fee?  Really?  Although I suspect that all hotels in the area are like this, it is pretty much a scam.  Everything, especially the food, is very expensive.  Nothing is cheap.  Oh, and there was no TV guide, so you have to flip through the channels; and there was a 2 second delay for every channel change.  And when are these Vegas hotels ever going to go smoke free?
As a long time happy customer when the TI was owned by Steve Wynn or it's last owners the MGM  It's now sad to report the TI under its new owner Phil Ruffin probably has the worst service of any casino on the strip. The property was sold to him 2 years ago, he was the previous owner of the Frontier Casino.. And guess what?  It is well on its way to becoming the low roller joint that the Frontier was it even has a Gilleys Bar to go along with the TI's old Pirate theme. Pick a theme will you!. . As an invited guess on my last visit my room was comp 'ed. So,I figure they like me. Right? I gamble a lot. So what could go wrong ? Turns out everything. . . Night 1 check in was ok then drink in Lobby Bar arrive 11:00 pm                                   I went to the bar for a night cap and ordered a beer, after a few sips I noticed my glass had a chipped razor edge, most likely from it hitting the tap. I notified my server  she then took my half consumed beer and emptied it into a new glass, not even checking to see if a glass chip was in the bottom of my old glass.  Not really a safe move, normally you would get a new glass and a new beer. My server looked like an aging ex stripper who had hit rock bottom. She was rude had no manors and offered no apologies. I paid my tab and went to bed.. . Day 2 I hit the pool totally obnoxious sceen loud blaring Rap music that most people we're cringing over and leaving almost as soon as they arrived. That evening I am eating dinner elsewhere as they offer no good food options.  So  I went to the Valet to get my rental car unfortunately the valet gave me the wrong car. The car was somewhat identical but not mime. When I returned  five hours later TI  security almost  tried to blame me even though I had the correct valet ticket. I felt bad for the people who really needed there car I am sure they were upset as well.. . Day 3 Service issues with room service a 2 hour wait for a midnight breakfast and  I was on hold for 30 min just for them to take my order! Again crazy bad service  to make matters worse my TV then goes out. So they send a cable guy to my room at 3:00 am rather then just giving me a new room, and he did not get it fixed.. . When I got  home I wrote a letter to the TI informing them of my crazy almost comical stay to my surprise I got a phone call from the general manager Mr. Najam Khan, he agreed with my concerns however he did not really apologize but said  when ever I return to Las Vegas just call him and he would gladly comp my next stay, he even gave me his private cell phone number. So three months later I called him for the comped room and this is where the itI really goes down hill. My call to the general manger goes as follows.. . 1st call to him he says send him and e-mail on my arrival dates which I did twice with no reply. 2nd call 3 days later says he will call me right back no call back. 3rd call a day later he says he's not going to comp me a room and says his room rate's are $290 a night! Which was total BS I am seeing on line the rates are about $70 a night via Expedia. Then I have to remind him of what happened during my last stay. He then claims to have no memory of it lucky for me I saved his voice mail and replayed for him his message from three months ago.  Then he says he has to search for the letter I sent 3 months ago. More stalling more BS.. . Botton line this place has sold out it's customer service and is now a low roller grind joint serving the lower end trailer trash crowd and gang banger market. They could care less about the customer  all they want is your money and then they tell you to get the hell out. Stay elsewhere  Ballys, Harrahs, or any MGM property will be better. Oh, the TI has the tightest slot's on the strip too, and they nickel and dime you for everything!  Not safe either a lot of thugs lurking around. Avoid at all cost!
The Hotel was very nice. The room was nice and quiet. The service was also good. The casino was tight and the tables were a little high for this type of Hotel. Better place to gamble but still a nice place to stay!
Rooms are decent and updated. Bed is horribly soft and ended up with a backache the whole weekend. No support at all in the mattress or the pillows. Our room faced the trump tower and was awoken all hours of the night by the train. They need to seal the windows better. Food is OK just expensive. $60 for two ppl to get some pho and spring rolls (that wasn't that great). Alcoholic beverages just crazy $. $8 for domestic beer at senor frogs. I think the $40 up charge to check in early is nuts "because it's a Friday". Cocktail waitresses look tired. My husband was glad they had a poker room. No great shopping here. CZ store and cheesy Vegas junk. Walkway is close and easy to get to better food and shops.
Rooms are nice, however, when we checked in, our room reeked of pot. When we called the desk to have someone clean our room, the guy at the front desk was very short with us, in fact hung up on us and says he would send someone right up (which he didn't). He actually asked us if the room "wasn't to our liking". Well, yeah. It's not. I paid good money for this room. I can't imagine housekeeping didn't smell it! How about don't book it again morons.
Sure - Treasure Island is older and not as exciting or sexy as the newest and hottest hotel on the strip.  But for $59 and across the street from Palazzo?  Perfect.  I was glad to pay the extra $30 for early check-in and another $30 for late check-out.  $120 - very reasonable!. . Plus, I was given too many coupons to count (two free buffets, a two-for-one buffet, two-for-one drinks, comp entry to the Fitness Center, etc.).  I took advantage of the free buffet at dinner.  In good conscience, how could I not?  That said, much of the food was over salted, but I did enjoy the variety - not over the top, but decent.  Hello, it was free!   . . The hotel is well maintained for being over 20 years old.  Service was fine.. . One con: The bed was uncomfortable.  It just didn't seem flat, but kind of wavy, hard to explain!
Being my first trip to Vegas I wasn't really sure where to stay so I chose Treasure Island because it seemed to be in a good location on the strip based on the map. Me and my fiance had an early flight and check-in wasn't until 3p.m. so we were a little concerned about what we were going to do with all of our luggage until then, but as soon as we arrived we were about to check-in, which was great. The check-in counter staff was pleasant. . . As far as our room goes there are no mini fridges or a coffee machines in the rooms so you have to go to one of the restaurants in the building or walk to an off site location. I don't know about everyone else, but sometimes it is nice to get up and have a cup of coffee before you have to leave your room. . . I mean it isn't the Ceasar's Palace or anything, but I would stay again if I went back to Vegas because although it is a smaller hotel and casino it is a decent place. For the price and the location you can't complain too much.
