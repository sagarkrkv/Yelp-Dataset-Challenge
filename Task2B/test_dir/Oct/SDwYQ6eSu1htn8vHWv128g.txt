Based on yelp reviews, I decided to drop in for a quick weekday solo lunch. I ordered the quinoa salad, which was light and tasty (also a great value at $5 for the half salad). I also ordered the tomato jam and artichoke spread flatbreads to try. The flatbreads are more of a bruschetta (served on toasted baguette) rather than a traditional flatbread. I was actually pleasantly surprised and ate those up like nobody's business. I do wish the tomato jam had a tad of spice to it, because it did get too sweet in a weird way. Regardless, I can't wait to come back and try more flatbreads. Come early because by 11:45am the parking lot was full (though there is mandatory valet).
Had my birthday lunch here! It was so good and the prosecco was amazing (and only $5). I love Postinos and thier bruschetta boards. I got a sandwich- the nine iron. It was good my only complaint is that the sauce must've been on the bread for a bit. It was very soggy on the bottom. Also, our server was nice and laid back- almost too laid back. My friend had to go back to work and it took him 20 mins to come and get her card so she could leave.
Quite delicious.  Plating looked great.  Service was a tad bit off so I took a star.  Great establishment otherwise.
Love, love, love this place :)
Parking is an issue so you will need to valet.  Great soup, sandwiches and bruchetta. . Love this wine bar.  Date night or girlfriend place. . . This is a city treasure
I doubt there is much else I can say about this place that hasn't been said. It is an easy place to love; the bruschetta, the salads, the wine, the service...it seems that they really have perfected it. Anytime this place comes up in a conversation on whether or not to go, my answer will always be Yes, Yes, YES!!!
Fabulous! Always a great experience!
First of all I'm starting off by giving it three stars because I think it is crazy that the parking lot is as small as it is and that it is valet parking!! Our waiter had absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever and had to make the comment that he was leaving shortly as if he was glad not to have us as customers.  Seriously, we were 3 50 year old women!! Since it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon we decided that we would just have some wine and bruschetta.  The wine was a Moscato and it actually was very good but I wish the waitress would know enough to put it on ice. My cousin who is a pretty aggressive person, asked for a bucket with ice. It has been quite a few years since I've been here and the bruschetta was definitely not as good as I remembered it.  There were a couple of standouts and then there were some that were just meh. Are tab was ninety dollars, and for that amount I would have expected a lot more. I think this place is a great hangout for people who live in the area or for those who want to be seen in a trendy restaurant. With so many new restaurants opening up I don't think I will be visiting this one for a long time.
Oh my goodness,  I love this place, but must admit that it can be frustrating trying to get a seat.  It is well worth the wait.. . A favorite thing for me is that you get a chance to try some awesome wines, and if you like you can buy a bottle or two while you are there.
