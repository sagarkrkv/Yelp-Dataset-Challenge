The place was busy but there was still a lot of open tables, they sat us down and waited 15 minutes and no one ever came to our table to take our order so I raised my hand and called the skinny Asian guy that always wears a tight white dress shirt and told him we had been waiting for over 10 minutes already and no one had taken our order, his reply was "you have not been here for 10 minutes" I told him we had been here for 15 minutes and his reply was "so are you going to order or are you going to leave?", we went ahead and ordered and got our order pretty quick, but the pho was very salty and had very little steak and noodles and a lot of broth. To sum it all up the guy was very rude and the pho was not good, we don't plan on coming here again, there are a lot better places in town for pho.
I love this Place! im from LA. But every time when im in Las Vegas im visiting thig place. Pho is very delicious!
Asked 3 waiters to take our order, but they would rather clean tables.  Last time I come here.
Decent pho open 24/7. I got the pho dac biet was pretty good although quite expensive for around $9. The service is here is pretty subpar which is my main reason for knocking this place down a bit. The waiters here all have pretty crappy attitudes and were slow to help, part of it could've been attributed to the fact it was 6AM and they were fairly busy but they definitely could've been nicer.
I love this place! I always recommend it and always bring people here from out of town. It is always packed but I have never waited too long, not a lot of room to wait but who cares because the food is bomb and you really don't wait that long. . Huuuuge menu and we like to try new things but my favs are by far - a big ol' bowl of Pho! Add broccoli because that's how I roll, I love my greens. The Drunken Noodles are awesome....I could def eat that whole plate myself, my boyfriend and I usually order a couple different things, meat plate, veggie plate like buck choy and then pho - we def get into the family style dining. That's what is so awesome - you can get your own thing or share! . Boba is great, smoothies are really good and the spring rolls are always a starter. and then you can catch an awesome show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre right behind it afterwards :)
I've eaten here tons of times and it's always been good, not great. It's a Las Vegas staple, for sure, especially because of the slightly crass name. Service is always ok. Food is always decent. The last time I had pho there, however, the meat was slimy and had a green tint, so it might be a moment for me to return.
EAT HERE!!!!. . I've been here about 5 or 6 times and this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The General Tso's chicken is the best in town-hands down!  They're head-on salt and pepper garlic shrimp is awesome too.  Service is quick and friendly and their location is relatively close to the strip!. . EAT HERE!!!!!!
I don't know about you but the last thing I want to do is spend a grip on the Strip for some mediocre food. Yes, yes, I know it's Vegas. I got that part but let me think about this for a sec. If I spend $75.00 on two burgers, two orders of fries, and two sodas at the Mirage, I expect my meal to be damn near fantastic. It wasn't though. Yet, everything happens for a reason and I think that reason was to find Pho Kim Long.. . After taking a cab ride to a Wells Fargo location to pull some funds out, the cab driver gave the terrific recommendation of this place and I'm so glad he did. What a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! This place is amaze-ballzzzz. Just to put things in perspective, I spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:. . 2 bowls of Pho. 2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut. 2 iced coffees. 1 order of egg rolls. . I was mad full afterwards and fully rehydrated afterwards.. . Luckily, I entered the restaurant right before their lunch rush so waiting for a table took all of two minutes before they said they had a table ready. During my almost week long stay in Vegas, I think I visited this place about three times and every time it was always full of people. From what I hear, this is the place to be come 4, 5, 6 in the morning but I don't have time for that nonsense. It was perfect at 10:30/11 a.m. for me. Honestly, the cab ride to and from and the entire meal each time was well worth the money.
I was in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice - I am sad I didn't get to eat here for every meal the entire time I was there. I had the chicken teriyaki which was great, but perhaps one of the best meals I have ever had was the pan fried noodles, #62. The crab rangoon was fantastic, the best I have ever had. My husband had the pho soup and the Singapore noodles, he was thrilled with both. . .  If I could have picked this restaurant up and carried to Florida with me I would have! This was the best food I have had in Vegas yet.
The food here is awesome! Always made fresh and tasty. This spot is one of my favorite places to eat! Its also open 24 hrs. My only problem with this place is the service. Sometimes i never get checked on or get a refil.... Cant go wrong with anything i order, i know i will like it! They also have bobba drinks to which is a plus.
Pho Kim Long is my favorite Vietnamese spot for pho!  The peanut sauce is delicious and the shrimp rolls are perfect. Make sure to try all of the different sauces...the fish sauce is my favorite even though it is very salty. I had the shrimp pho, shrimp rolls, the Chinese doughnuts, and Thai coffee and I could have rolled home and slept for hours on my full, satisfied tummy!
Food is usually great and service is usually good as well. . . My only two issues are . 1. They give you your bill on brand new American Express trays but don't accept American Express..?. . 2. When my boyfriend tried to order pan fried noodles she said he wouldn't like them because we're not Asian..? So he said okay and asked if he could have pan fried noodles with chow fun and the waitress still said he wouldn't like it because he isn't Asian and highly recommended him to get chow me in. Excuse me? Just because we're white doesn't mean we don't like good food.
So we are in Las Vegas and of course paying Las Vegas prices for everything! Well sakino, as usual, jumps on yelp and JUST HAPPENS to find a Pho place... Coincidence right? Little Rock to Honolulu, LA to Vegas... Okinawa all the same. This Japanese wife of mine loves Pho. . So of course, off we go..... . I must say, it's hard for me to necessarily tell the difference between Pho (broth etc) but SOMETHING about this place just seemed slightly better. Now then that's not to say the others were subpar... Just this one is somehow ... BETTER. . My wife, whom is some kinda pho semi-pro-am taster expert, confirmed my suspicions by vocally stating over and over how GOOOOOD hers was. . I don't know the names. I had pho something with brisket. Large. Dumped sriracha in it and went to town. No veggies (onions etc) just meat and noodles and I Jammed out. No hassle from. Waitstaff. . The wife got Pho Ga. Loved it. Large size. Put it like this... Of all the restaurants I review, she has never actually finished her meal, ever.... She slammed that large bowl, totaled it. That is a testament of how good/legit it was. . Vegas can get expensive... This place was refreshingly cheap and super delicious. About 3 min drive from circus circus. Parking is a B***h but whatever, circle around until you find one. It's worth it. . If you're visiting Vegas or a local... Get some Vietnamese in ya life... That Pho FoSho!
I came here about two nights ago for the first time and I have to say the food was deliciouse! But the service was AWFUL really makes me not want to go back! I went around 3 am and maybe the waiters were tired but it was my first time going so obviously I had some questions but they would reply very rudely and sarcastically! My boyfriend and I ordered one thing each and left! Maybe ill come back earlier one day to see how the afternoon workers are with customer service!
Me and my stupid boyfriend went here to eat really late at night. My boyfriend got the wonton soup because he's so basic. He says the soup was really good. I had some pho soup. It was number thirteen on the menu. It was perfect. We also had the chicken lettuce wraps 8/10. According to the drama queen of boyfriends, it wasn't as good as PF Changs. The service was quite attentive. They don't wet napkins by the way. How do I know? I asked.
We went here on Sunday night, since we saw a big sign stated best vote and we were disappointed.  They were busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table of two.  My husband ordered pho and it was ok.  I ordered com ga and springrolls and both werent that good.  The services are friendly and fast.  Overall, we didn't have a great experience and a little pricey.
Love this place! My favorite pho restaurant in town, hands down! The service is always so quick and attentive. The food is always up to par, I've tried almost every dish on the menu and I can honestly say there is not one bad thing. Definetly a must-try if you are visiting from out of town! :)
Big banner on the outside prints Best Pho in Las Vegas?  But taste all the same to me.
I am a food snob. Therefore it's hard to please me completely. I've been here many times and never been disappointed!!  Always wonderful food, always a friendly, warm, fast staff!  This is the best there is!
It's cheap, fast and not touristy. Every time we're in Vegas we have to come here. Get the 23 with extra pork. It's the Shit!!!
Good food. But if you go during busy hours..expect not to get full service. They take a while to get back to you every time. I still like coming here tho.  Their pho is really good..always get #13. We have tried other food but we always stick w pho.
The vegan pho soup is fantastic. Japanese stir fried udon is a must don't miss out on this. Top it off with some Mongolian beef with brown rice and you are good to go. Bathroom is not a good place to be at. The dude has one glove on and rocks away with the same towel all surfaces. Let's hope my immune system can battle whatever bacteria makes it to their kitchen.
I've been here twice and I'll be coming back for more, great food, good prices, good service.  I highly recommend the pork broth soup with egg noodles, awesome.
Of course I'm a fan, it's become a bit pricier since I first came so we'll keep an out eye for the others around the area, especially when they're really busy.. . Great variety, quick service and can't go wrong after a long night/morning on the strip.
I've been here give times since I landed in Vegas but my phone was always dead .. Lol I love this place their veggie pho is to die for .. Always a wait to be seated but well worth it
Absolutely amazing!! I would eat here everyday if I could haha. They're quick and customer service is excellent. Order Pho Dac Biet and it came out in less then 2 minutes and it tasted amazing. Good things is they're open 24 hours, means party hard and come there buzzed for the best food you can have after a great night. Went here the next day and tried the Broken rice with grilled pork . Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to go here at least once. There are you many other things in the menu I have yet to try, but I will haha. Prices are decent too, unlike these ridiculous casino prices and to top it off casino food isn't that amusing to me unless it's like a buffet or something.
Food poor quality and salty. Place is dirty. My second time here. Thought will be better this time. Not coming back anymore.
