Garlic shrimp was okay, didn't live up to the hype.. Also ordered papaya salad, tom yum and green curry. Curry was excellent. Tom Yum was weak, too sour and not enough heat. Papaya salad was decent but I have had better.. . We were lucky to get there at 5:30. Make a reservation or get there early if you don't want to wait 2 hrs.
The food was very good but this restaurant is overpriced.  Servings are small and prices extremely high.  Just because demand for Thai food is up it doesn't mean this establishment should take advantage and rip off patrons.
went for dinner with 7 people tonight. the place was like a complete circus.. it was very noisy, the waitstaff were rude and unfriendly and it seemed as. Though Their own culture were getting service. our food was cold and had to. Be reheated and interestingly enough they threw the18  percent tip on at the . End. there has to be better thai food in LV, and to be quite frank. This place. Needs an overhaul and clearly they have grandiose thinking that they are. So great because of prior ratings. I definitely would not waste my time and money.. . . Very disappointing........
DELICIOUS! . . We have tons of great Thai food where I'm from in Seattle, and I wish I could take this restaurant home with me. . . Best Pad Thai I've ever tasted. Not bland at all. We ordered extra to go! . . Huge wine selection. . . This place is hidden away in a dim lit strip mall, but as soon as you walk inside, you'll see it's packed. Make a reservation if you don't want to wait!
Delicious Thai food and friendly service.  However, it appears to have become a tourist joint with several taxis waiting outside, and while the prices were similar to other Thai restaurants, the portions were smaller than I'm used to.
A culinary masterpiece in Thai Food. Trust me when I say that this place is worth the 2hr wait. Though the prices are a bit on the high end side the food is really that good! Amazing High Quality Thai Cuisine. My family and I come here every time we're in Vegas. Our absolute favorite Thai Food Restaurant. Highly recommended: their Tiger Prawns, Tom Yum Kha, Fried Pomfret and Spicy Shrimp Fried Rice. One thing I wasn't a huge fan of though, was their SeaBass Drunken Noodles...it's not worth  the price. Despite that this place is a Must!!
Best Thai food I've ever had. I'm from Southern California and we have a lot of Asian food choice as well as a exceptional Thai restaurants. By far I have not had any tastier Thai food till I walked in this establishment. My only complaint is the open sign in front says they open at 11:30am, but they really open at 11.
The line can get ridiculous, but it's worth the wait.  This place is a bit different than your average Thai place, in that they serve both northern and southern Thai food.  Northern Thai is rare in the US, and it really shouldn't be. I had the Khao Soi, and it was delicious.. . PS, I would not try walking here.  Either drive or take a cab.
Probably the best Thai restaurant I've had the pleasure of visiting so far!!. . When you think you want a spice level of 8 and the wait staff recommend something lower....you should trust them.  We started our foray into their legendary cuisine with the glass noodles and were pre-warned about the heat level.  Those were some of the hottest noodles I've ever had.  It was definitely an experience everyone should have.  The rest of our dishes, which were also very hot compared to what I normally eat, were mild in comparison and at the end of the meal I craved the masochistic spice level of the noodles.. . Every dish was excellent and the 40 minute wait was worth it.. . The strip mall location is very deceiving and before you walk in you expect some sort of "sleazy massage parlor full of henchmen waiting to kill you" environment.  But once you walk in the door you are very nicely surprised at the decor, the lively ambiance, and the large array of wines.. . Andrew Zimmern's visit to Lotus of Siam:. http://www.travelchannel.com/video/andrew-visits-lotus-of-siam. . Next time I return to Vegas I will definitely return here!  There are way too many items to try and it may take 10 more trips.
Absolutely delicious.  Authentic Thai food from different regions of Thailand. My only regret is that I didn't get to try more dishes! . . 1. Opened at 11am on Monday . 2. BBQ chicken was moist and flavorful!. 3. Red curry, chicken friend rice, and drunkin noodles were all on point. . 4. Next time I'm trying the green curry and pork sausage! . . Portions are small, but the dishes were so delicious! I can't wait to eat here again when I'm in Vegas!
Gave this spot a few chances, I have not been wow-ed by the food here. Every thing we ordered was lacking some flavor. My mom ordered her food very spicy, came out with no spice...my dish was simply bland, and the portions didn't really match the prices. . Service was swift, but the food isn't as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. I've had better Thai for a better price and more appropriate portion size.
Got recommended by my friend who lives in Vegas, and i was happy to try this place when i was there. I am a big fan of thai
This is my second time at the restaurant but my first review.  If I would have reviewed it my first time, I would have given it 4 stars.  However, the second time around, it was just OK.  Yes,  it is better than your typical average Thai restaurant.  However, for me, it's all about the quality/price ratio.  We ordered the garlic prawns and the crispy duck over drunken noodle.  The prawns were good but not as crispy as I remembered the first time.  The duck was good, but the amount of the duck and noodles that you get is small compared to the cost.  I don't think I will go back to it since there are so many good restaurants to try in Vegas.
Ordered Tom Kah Kai soup with 8 level spicy and the Panang again. The soup was good and I don't think I ordered the same soup last time. Oh well. It seemed like it was extremely spicy this time for an 8. The next time, husband would've preferred 6 spicy. I ordered the drunken soft shell crab at 10 spice level. The soft shell crab was over taken by the home made chili and not as much basil that is on the drunken prawns. Texturally the prawns have a crunch that makes that dish shine versus the soft shell crab. In the future, I might try it at 9 spice level.
This place has THE BEST Thai food I've had. EVER. And I've had some good Thai food in Cali! 6 out of 5 stars, unofficially. The menu is HUGE, if only I could eventually get to every single one. That would be quite a feat...hmm...new blog ideas brewing. I had the very wonderful fortune of going with veterans of ordering at Lotus of Siam. I don't think I even opened the menu! They just knew exactly what to order, and I merely sat, anticipating each dish to enjoy.. . In all seriousness, though...this place is beyond awesome. All the dishes we ordered were great! Make sure you know your spice levels. I LOVE spicy food, even if it hurts later. Just deal with it, folks.. . My favorite: Tom Yum Kai -- the Tom Yum soup with chicken. WOW. It was the perfect amount of lemongrass and spice. I think by the end, it was a little spicy for us...but just make sure to pace yourself. I love putting some rice in my soup to help balance out the textures and also the spiciness. If you really like the lemongrass taste and the spice, get like a medium level spice (maybe something like a 5) and enjoy! This soup came out with the papaya salad (review of it down below), which was a little too much spice all at once. I saved some of my papaya salad to eat with the other dishes, since that's just a little too much spiciness to have together without anything else to balance it out.. . What else we ordered (EVERYTHING was delicious):. . Crispy duck: wow, it was very crispy and flavorful! Loved this dish, will definitely get it again next time. I see that a lot of people order this as a curry dish. I wonder if it makes a difference in the flavor of the duck itself, or even the curry itself? Well we had already ordered a separate curry noodle dish, so I guess I'm pretty happy with this choice. It keeps the integrity of the crunch and makes it crispy longer, that way. . . Garlic prawns: OK, so speaking of crispy. Holy Crispy Crunchy Crackling Goodness, Batman! Cap'n Crunch is put to shame. This is seriously one of the THE BEST crispy prawns I've had. I don't normally eat the shell of prawns, but I ate every tiny little crunchy bite of this prawn down to the tail. Oh my goodness, that's how good it is. Another great idea I had: make this into a bag of "chips" and I would buy the whole factory. For reals, though. Could someone please come up with that? It's nothing like the Shrimp flavored snacks that you find in Asian markets. This would have to replicate the crunch and flavor of this exact garlic prawn dish. Do it and let me know. . . Braised beef short ribs over noodles: I actually can't remember how this dish was...I think I was too busy with the other stuff above...Ooops. I guess I won't be ordering this dish next time LOL. . . Papaya Salad: I don't know why I'm adding this at the end, even though it was one of the first dishes that came out. It was really good and fresh, as far as papaya salads go. I feel like this dish was a little overpowered by all the other dishes, so I'm sorry that this became like the poor neglected pet who gets shoo-ed away when a new baby arrives in the family. . . I think I've written enough now. I hope you guys enjoy this place as much as I did! I really can't wait to go back...
This place. I love this place. I went here based on a recommendation from a friend and it has changed my taste buds forever. Every time I come here, I order a feast of food. . . The crispy duck panang curry is amazing, the beef pad se-ew is delicious, the Tom Kha Kai soup, perfect, and the garlic prawns are a must have. It can be a bit pricy, however the food is truly worth the price (and wait). . . I would recommend making a reservation prior to coming here because the wait can be at least an hour on a typical weekday. However, they do their best to accommodate you. The staff is also friendly and the last time I came here, they were very quick to serve the five dishes I ordered. . . If you come to Vegas, please make sure you stop by Lotus of Siam, you won't regret it.
Eat. Here.  There is a vast menu, food is reasonably priced. The food is well prepared.  I can keep going on  and on, but I am making myself hungry thinking about this place.  Yummo!
Wow this place did not disappoint at all and was better than I expected.  Came with a decent sized group so we got to try a few dishes and almost all of them were really good.  The dishes came out faster than I expected which was great since we have impatient little kids.  Make reservations b/c this place is crazy busy on the weekends.. . Recommended:. Seabass in drunken noodles. khao soi. Beef salad with ribeye. Garlic Shrimp. Crispy duck penang. . Decent:. Softshell crab with drunken noodles: too little crab. Nua yum katiem - spicy and not as good as the other beef salad
Next to city Thai this is one of my fav spots.  That being said don't hate Grish but this place has the most velvety (as if this is a real word) Khao soi.  Short ribs Thai dish.
Not sure what the hype is all about but I went with a group of friends and ordered chicken curry duck curry some sour soup crab fried rice. Everything was good, yes but the food is not better than Krung Siam off Spring Mountain. Lotus Siam was way too crowded and loud atmosphere.
Truly the most AMAZING thai food you can get in America! My husband and I make trips to Vegas just for this food! . . Lotus of Siam is off the beaten path in Vegas but any concierge or taxi butler knows Lotus of Siam. I highly suggest you make a reservation, the restaurant is quit large since they expanded but the tables fill up quickly.. . The atmosphere is nothing to write home about but the service and food is perfect. I would recommend getting a wine recommendation with your meal. They have quite an extensive list off Rieslings that perfectly compliment any thai meal.. . Seriously EVERYTHING is amazing but I would make 1 special recommendation....it is not on the menu but they will make a fried sea bass in massaman curry that will blow your mind!. . If you love thai food...please go here...you won't be sorry!
Gets alot of hype from being on Top Chef. But there are much better Thai restaurants in Vegas and the price is too high. It is a tourist trap.
Thai is my favorite. If I find a good Thai place, I am a loyal customer to the end. I even went to Thailand specifically to take cooking classes and had a wonderful time.. . I went to Vegas for my birthday weekend and one of my best friends raved about Lotus of Siam and encouraged me to go. So I went first thing I arrived and had my first dinner there. We ordered the stuff everyone raved about for our first dinner -- and I was beyond unimpressed. In fact, I didn't like a single one of the dishes. One of the dishes everyone said was a "must order" (Nam Kao Tod, aka crispy rice with sausage) I thought was awful. It was too salty, the rice was not crispy at all, and there was no actual flavor to distinguish that made it taste good.. . The other "must order" (and is the cover photo on their home page) is the Garlic Prawns. They didn't suck but anything fried is pretty good as long as it's fresh. Unfortunately, they were dimensionless in flavor and had very little prawn meat (it was mostly fried shell and was overpriced).. . And lastly, because they're known for their Northern Thai dishes (which is hard to find in the US) and because I love jackfruit, we ordered the Kang Ka Joon (spicy young jack fruit curry) -- what I thought would be a curry turned out to be a tangy clear broth soup and the jackfruit was "off"in texture and the flavor was just ... flat.. . We were beyond disappointed and the wait staff never came back to check in on us after delivering our food. We didn't want to throw the towel on the first go, so we went back on our last day to have our last meal(lunch) there. When we went back for our last lunch we decided to just stick with some classics: Pad See Ew, Green Curry Chicken, and Green Papaya Salad. We asked for the salad to be mild but it came out so flaming hot that they had to remake it for us. We asked for a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and they brought us a 10. The other two dishes were just fine. A solid B, but not something I would consider as "the best Thai in North America." I love Jonathan Gold (the food writer for the LA Times) to pieces and his reviews are usually spot on, but I have to say that I would never go out of the way to go back to Lotus of Siam because I have had such good Thai all over the country (especially in Southern California and in New York City).. . And I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to go there, either. But if you're in Vegas and you have your own car and you're hankering for Thai food, this might be your best/only option. Otherwise, it's not worth the hype or the wait. Just go if there's no line or wait. Fortunately, we only waited 15 minutes for our dinner and for lunch we just walked in.. . I really wanted it to work out but honestly, it was just kind of meh. It's really too bad.
Absolutely delicious! . . We went here for a pre-wedding dinner the night before. We love Thai and wanted to compare to our local favorite. . . I liked the Tom Kha Gai. The hint of lime was refreshing. . . We also tried several others dishes. We asked for medium spicy but I felt like it wasn't that spicy. However, it was still best Thai food (aside from our usual local favorite) we've tried! We'll definitely come back!. . One small note, come when your not rushed for time. Our waiter and food took a little bit longer than we're used to, but it wasn't a problem.
Luckily I didn't know about all the hype until we actually got here. I didn't realize it was a famous restaurant. It's off Sahara in the most unlikely spot, and it looks like a hole in the wall, but once you get in it's actually quite big inside. It was crazy busy on this Wednesday night but they were able to seat us about 15 minutes early.. . The service is very fast and Asian-level friendly. We ordered the crispy duck with drunken noodles, stuffed chicken wings, Nua Nam Tok (charbroiled beef slices) and green curry. . . The stuffed chicken wings were a disappointment. I've had better at other restaurants, and my own that i make are by far WAY better. The rest of the food was all really good, and my favorite was the crispy duck. The curry was very normal, nothing special. The Nua Nam Tok was maybe a 7/10. . . The portions are TINY! For three people we probably could've used one more entree. We also ordered a glass of wine each, and it came to about $55 a person, which is damn expensive for Thai food.. . All in all, it was good. I'd like to go back and try some other things on the menu, which, by the way, is HUGE. It's like 10 pages! But I dunno..I would also be just as happy going to the Thai place down the street from me for half the cost.
The best Thai food I've ever had. Truly exceptional - tried the Tom Yum Koong soup (level 6 out of 10)- heavenly. I would come back for the soup alone. We also had the garlic prawn (recommend 100%) chicken pad Thai, chicken fried rice (best I ever had) chili basil ground chicken (definitely recommend), garlic wings and a strip steak. My boyfriend swears by the Thai iced tea but I'm more of a regular iced tea girl and both were great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
All the reviews are right.  The garlic shrimp is excellent. The duck with penang curry is amazing. Driving by you would think nothing of this place. Its so plain outside.  If i didnt know i would have thought this place was closed.  It's a definite stop when you go to vegas.  i have found my go to spot in Vegas for thai.  What a lucky find, if only this was the casino
Consistently amazing Thai food. The garlic prawns alone are worth the trip off the strip!
MAKE A RESERVATION.. . Don't be a dumbass and not make a reservation.  If you are going to vegas and have about a week of notice, you should be able to get a slot no problem.  It's not a ridiculous wait for walk-ins, but it's an unnecessary wait if you just pick up the phone.. . The food.. . In short, thai food executed at a high level without being pretentious.. . My recommendations:  . . Appetizers:. . Spicy garlic chicken wings - These wings are deep fried to get the skin nice and crispy and glazed in a sweet garlic chili sauce that make for the right balance of sweet, spicy, salty and crispy.. . Nam Kao Tod:  . Crispy rice with pieces of pork and green onion.  This dish, if I recall correctly has some spice to it.  Not for everyone, but a nice textual accompaniment.. . Mains:. . Pad Thai - A refreshingly light take on something that can be bogged down with sauce.  The right balance of noodles, peanuts and sauce.. . Pad See Ew - This was good, I don't recall what was in it exactly. . Garlic prawns - If you order anything from this list, make sure you order these.  These are large prawns that are breaded and deep fried to the point where the shells are edible (if you don't mind a bit of chewing).  These are my favorite here.. . Panang curry - I'm not a curry fan, but this was good.. . In short, catch a cab and look for the weird Green Door massage parlor and you'll see the line out the door for this place.   If you have reservations, you'll have a great dinner.
As everyone is already saying, the garlic prawns are a must-have. A bit on the pricey side, but I don't know any other thai restaurant that does this. We also had drunken noodles....meh. $15 (?) was way overpriced for a sub-par product. . . Location: the restaurant is difficult to find. it's in a shady part of Las Vegas, so lock your doors! However, once you step inside the restaurant, you feel like you've been transported to a thai palace. weird. . . We lucked out and got in last minute, so make sure you make reservations. Otherwise, order out!
Love this place. One of the few things I miss about living in Vegas! Seafood spaghetti is to die for!!
Service wasn't the best but the food was amazing. I strongly recommend the Garlic Prawns!!
This place is way overated! We ordered the tom kha kai; and it was extremely salty and sour. The crispy duck curry and drunken noodle were quite boring, nothing special. Plus they are overpriced! Service was also really bad. With the money that I spent here, I rather go to some Thai restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip to enjoy better food and service. It was like a joke to me!
Lotus of Siam is a great experience! A must try place in Vegas! Wonderful variety of Thai cuisine with a friendly and efficient staff!. . Definitely recommend making a reservation- this place can get busy!
