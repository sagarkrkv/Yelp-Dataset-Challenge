We got there around 11:00pm on 09/25 and the line was pretty long, but moving pretty fast. The lady who checked us in, Prytzel, was super friendly. Upgraded us to a newer room, and made us feel at home.. . The hotel entrances always smell good and clean, weird for a Vegas hotel but true!. the room was nice, pretty new. The one thing I would change about it would be the shower head, everything was pretty new and it just didn't seem like they cared much for it. But other than than, it was a pretty nice stay.. . I would have rated it 5 stars, but on 09/27 the housekeepers decided to come in the room and clean it. Now this would have been nice and all, but we had the privacy sign up the whole weekend. When they cleaned, I did lose the cloth to clean my sunglasses, small I know, but it's about the principle.. . But that won't stop us from staying here again. We liked it. and it isn't far from the other hotels.
Where to start. . . As a Vegas veteran, I know what to expect on the Strip. But hey, I stay on the Strip because that is where the best times are!! Sure there are a lot of drunk, loud college kids- my group included. Everything is overpriced, which is why I bring my own bottled water and beer thank you. I would rather pay through the nose and be in the middle of it all than stay off strip and make up the difference in cab fare. . . When I saw the prices at this hotel I was pretty stoked for my Labor day get away. I have stayed at MGM, NYNY and Luxor and LOVED this area of the strip. Mostly younger people just having a good time. So I booked the room. . . Upon arriving at the hotel I was met by a saleslady at the door announcing she had my welcome gift. Having never experienced this before, I thought it was just a nice gesture but the little voice in my head reminded me "this is Vegas, nothing is free". So my group of 3 guys and myself spent about 10 minutes being talked to about show tickets before we realized it was a hustle. I figured it was a one time thing, but by the end of the trip we literally were running past the doors to not get hassled. HOW ANNOYING! . . We check in and are told we are on the 2nd floor. Kind of a bummer, because let's face it, I love the lights and a good view makes the room. I don't say anything and get to the room hoping we at least are looking at the Luxor.. I opened my window and to my dismay we were 5 feet from a brick wall. Yes seriously- a window facing another part of the hotel building. . . We went about our first night hanging out and walking the casino. I crashed earlier because I had been up so early to finish packing while my boyfriend and his friend stayed out drinking. I woke up about 6 am the following day feeling itchy. I go to the bathroom and turn on the light and there is a HUGE BEDBUG on my leg. I freaked out and killed it, noticing bites on my leg and both my feet. I immediately wake up everyone in the room and call the front desk. They proceed to send a security guard up who is pretty nonchalant like this is an every day occurrence.. . They switch us to another room after many pictures are taken and in the new room we notice it is REALLY dirty. I mean not the average, partied in Vegas room dirty, but dried boogers on the sheets nasty dirty. We asked the manager for yet another room and she came through with a really nice suite for us. That is the only reason this place gets 2 stars. Take it from me, if you are going to stay here, buck up and get the suite. . . The buffet was super cheap, and basically you get what you pay for, super cheap food. We went to the Wynn buffet one day and it was AWESOME. . . Basically if you are wanting the strip and want to gamble on getting bitten by bedbugs, stay in a standard room. For a nicer experience get a suite. For an even better time, stay at MGM, they know how to clean the rooms right!
This has to be the worst hotel I have stayed at. The people trying to sell you shows are the rudest of all the hotels. They only had 1 pool open even though there was 3 major events going on the whole weekend. Then to top it off noone bothered to let us know that their buffet was closed for renovations. Waste of money and will never stay their again.
We arrived at the Exaclibur at about 10:30PM on a Thursday night and went right to check in. This was probably the only sour point about my experience at this hotel. Our friends were behind us in line, so we were served first. When we went to check in our agent, Nina, said there were no kings left but that we could come down the next day and they would move us. There was some back and forth between her and the agent helping our friends and then we were all checked in and ready to go. Our friends came over and told us that they had been upgraded to a King room. At which point I was like wtf? We went upstairs and lo and behold, they had NOT been upgraded, their agent had lied to them. Not impressed with that.. . The next day we did go back down and Kathy was happy to help us switch and was very prompt at doing so. We didn't have to give back our old keys, just leave them in our room and we were able to move immediately. Our new room had a strip view, which was nice, and a king bed and was as well appointed as our previous room.. . One thing with this hotel is the noise. Because you're on the strip, non strip view rooms will be quieter. I'm a light sleeper and I slept with earplugs every night, if not for the noise from the strip, for the noise from the air conditioner. Every single room we had (between four of us) had loud a/c units.. . The hotel itself is pretty well situated, you really wouldn't have to leave if you didn't want to. The casino is spacious and I was able to play all the games I wanted to without having to wait long. I also found $100USD on the floor my first night :D Lucky me! The food court has some good options, starbucks, mcdonalds, krispy kreme, etc,and there's lots to see and do within the casino itself. Location wise, I would have preferred to be closer to the main part of the strip but you get what you pay for.. . The only other bad thing at this hotel was constantly being hounded to go and see this new property they were pushing. "We'll feed you and you'll tour the facility" they said. "We'll give you cheap show tickets" they said. Very suspicious and my bullshit radar was up - avoid these guys like the plague, they'll hunt you down. After a while, we stopped admitting that we lived at the same address just so they'd leave us alone.. . Overall, this was a great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The slots were great, the amenities were good, the rooms were well appointed and fairly modern and it wasn't hard to get around. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for - we didn't want to spend a ton of money for four nights in Vegas, we wanted that money to go to gambling and shopping and eating. This was a reasonably priced, clean hotel. We didn't spend a ton of time in our rooms besides sleeping and changing and it suited us just fine.
No WiFi on top floors u needed a laptop to whook up to internet via eather net cable who the he'll uses laptops anymore lol...toilet took 2 hours 2 fill up before used again....very out dated and dingy feeling hotel... Won't recommend
I am a Vegas veteran been there four times this year alone. I was pretty happy when I seen how cheap this hotel was for 5 days so we decided to give it a try. Worst mistake ever! We booked a smoking room and ended up on the first floor with no view. It reminded me of a prison because as soon as you opened the curtains all we seen was a brick wall no view what so ever. Then, every time we came back to the hotel in the early morning hours we would literally be harassed by security to show them our room keys. The staff is rude and their are always people bothering you about show tickets and other bs crap. The decor is old and ugly in the hallways and the rooms. Also good luck trying to find an ice machine anywhere!!! I would never stay there again even if it was free. Spend a little extra money and go stay somewhere better.
Room are nice enough but has a few BIG fails in my book. No wifi in the room is awful.  We were forced to run downstairs to use our tablets because who lugs computers with you for only wired internet. Definitely cut out  spontaneity. The resort fee is a total scam. No resort here. Plus you still have to pay $10 per day to work out. Not that I wanted too, but you had to add up all the fees and see that this great deal isn't all that great.
I wanted a cheap hotel for 4 days and this was it arrived late around 11 pm and the room was upgraded for free it has a food court the only thing I hated was the smell after the 3 nights the smoke smell in the casino was really irritating other than that it was fine! The casino was good even tho I was asked3 different times for my ID
Not impressed!!! Of all the choices on the strip, I would not stay here again. We had to pay a resort free of 18.00 a day for the use of the pool and the internet. We knew this before we got there so it wasn't a surprise. However, we we went to use the pool only half of the pools were open and what was open was very crowded. It was the first week in October and they were closed for the season. I was barely able to use the internet in our room.  I emailed customer service to let them know and they never responded.. . The rooms are very outdated. They need a major upgrade. When we booked our vacation, we asked for a view. I'm not sure what their idea of a view is but mine is NOT the side of another building.. . The restaurant options were good. They did have that going  for them.. . I would not choose this hotel again.
Hotel & Casino in stile medievale, situato a una delle estremita della Strip, proprio di fronte al New York, New York. Le stanze sono molto spaziose, pulite e tutte, credo, dotate di 2 Queen bed. Possibilita di richiedere una stanza fumatori (lo sconsiglio perche sono le peggiori e situate al piano piu basso). All'interno dell'hotel, diversi ristoranti fast-food e qualche negozio. Wi-fi gratuito negli spazi comuni. Buon rapporto qualita prezzo.
I hated this place the whole time I was here. First of all, it seemed as if to get any where in the hotel, you had to walk through the casino and I went to other hotels and that wasn't an issue there. Secondly, the parking is awful. You either search 45 min for a surface parking spot or try your luck in the 3-story garage a mile from the hotel doors. Service was alright, wasn't rude and not a problem. Now, the room. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is absolutely awful, it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must. If you could book a non-smoking room there wasn't a mention of it. There was no wifi and there wasn't a channel guide for the TV. The TV also was not even close to HD. The beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap. This hotel also has the worst dining on the strip. A dicks last resort? Really? I know most hotels had fast food courts but fast food seemed the best the Excalibur could offer. As for a view, you either pay more for one of the strip or you get the parking lot or a brick wall. Cheap, tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place. The only redeeming qualities was that I heard they had a DQ and their pool. The extra $40 for a different hotel on the strip is absolutely worth it. This place is essentially the Motel 6 of the strip. Just know, looks can be deceiving
I have stayed at the older un-remodeled rooms before. While old, they were still very clean and well maintained. This trip when checking in they upgraded me to remolded rooms for free. I was quite surprised how nice they were. I have stayed at quite a few hotels on the Strip, and the new rooms are on par with a lot of the newer rooms. The only downside, they still do not have WiFi. Ethernet only
Ok... My issue is not the fact that they need to update. I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for and we paid for cheap and that's what we got.  My issue is bed bugs.  I came home and my bag and clothes had them.  Now it's one thing to be cheap it's another to be dirty... This is just dirty. I am not happy about this
Only here for the night... Checked in smells horrible like smoke.. They gave us an upgrade for a suite nice of them but the room reeks like mold or humid  I hate that smell... Never coming back
Beds were comfy, but no coffee pot in room. I forgot my pillow in the room and the jack ass at the counter wouldn't send anyone up to get it for me. I'm sorry, but, that's bad customer service. And the Buffet was closed for renovation and nobody thought to tell us when making reservation!! We would have went to another tell if we would of know that. Never staying here again!  The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because of the beds, otherwise it would have been 1.
: I spend most of my time in Vegas and I must say this hotel has served me well and right. Location is absolutely great, hotel staffs are friendly and very accomodating, summertime hotel price is an absolute deal.
Everything was nice until we got our bill and there were four extra charges for resort fees. Excalibur you are scum 191 turned into 291... unacceptable...never again
(We hated this hotel. It was horrible. They offered to "upgrade" our rooms. If that was a upgrade then I would like to see what a down grade was. Our rooms were smelly. Very outdated and we booked a King room. We were upgraded to a double. We called and told them and they said we could move the next day. The next day we had to hang around until noon so we wouldn't miss out on moving rooms. When we got to new rooms they were still disappointing. They were non smoking rooms but had cigarette butts inside the window seal. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, including pubic hair on toliet. The rooms need to be updated very much. The beds are hard and very uncomfortable. This room the tv didnt work and we had to call down two days to get this fixed. The only positive thing about hotel was the food choices. They had a variety and not all of them would break the bank. As far as rooms go, I would never recommend Excalibur. Total let down!  Oh the other thing nice was the location. But I can have the same location at the Luxor. It is a wonderful hotel.
Of all of the hotels of the same price range, I would rate this one the lowest.  The room is very dated. The furnitures are extremely old n dated (badly scuffed). No power outlets except for the one in the bathroom. Of course, one can always crawl behind the dresser or unplug the lamp. I do not think power outlets by the desk is too much to ask for. There is no safe and small fridge. The pillows are nasty.  The room, bed and bathroom are clean. The toilet flushes and there is hot water. This place is one step above Motel 6. But motel 6 does not charge you for bringing your dogs and it's cheaper.
Well if I had more fidelity I would give 2.5 stars. I stayed here last year with no issues,  this year I had a bed with bugs it seemed.  I tried second bed and it was better but not great. I called desk in the morning and they were super quick to find me a new room on same floor and reprogrammed my key so I was able to change rooms without even having to go to the desk. Their staff all seemed friendly and professional and security minded as well. Their prices are awesome and they have plenty of clean rooms if you want to try your luck, not in the casino.  :). . They are centrally located with tram and elevated walkways.
