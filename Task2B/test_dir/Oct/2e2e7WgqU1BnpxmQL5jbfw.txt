I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. . . Random musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. . . Don't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. . . The highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. . . For where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.
Disappointed? Yes. Feel like my fellow Yelpers duped me? Yes. Confused? You bet your ass!!. . Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of "The worlds greatest hot Sandwich". If you put that claim out there your Sandwiches better be pretty damn amazing. Sadly, no.. . The Full Montagu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#7NJLUm9T5aCBtyZLQrdO3w) - $6.49. Yeah, it was cheap and hot but also fairly small. The Beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, I know America likes their Beef still Moo'ing. No big deal yet then the Salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor. . . My Husband had the Holiday Turkey (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#__Es78IE8ZJeG61x_gtvww) - $6.49 Which he said was and I quote ''fairly good''. He then went to on to tell me it was probably the best Turkey and Stuffing Sandwich he's got from a Sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.. . The sad conclusion I came to here is that open a Sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.
Really good Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I wasn't sure what to expect from a fast food chain like that but the resulting sandwich was VERY good. Filling enough, but not so much that you feel stuffed.. . Ambiance is...similar to any fast food restaurant. (Loud and sometimes not as clean as you'd like.) However, you have to kind of temper your expectation since a fast food experience isn't going to be some 4-star restaurant.. . Good food, reasonable price (even on the strip) and it was made quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely go again.
OMG! The bomb king of sandwiches! A recent discovery when I was in Vegas. Late night craving and long lines, I'd do it all over again. I'm in Love with Earl!!! Highly Recommend their classic "Full Montagu"!
Best sandwich place ever! Lines can get long but staff is super efficient and the sandwiches are worth the wait. Dining area can get crowded but all orders are made to go so take it back to your room or out to the strip for dinner and a show.
So glad I saw this place on Yelp! This is the only place I've found in Vegas where you can get great food for under $10. I got the veggie sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.
I got a salad,  it was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. My friend and my husband got the same sandwich I believe it was the avocado bacon sandwich and they both said it was good but wish that I had more fillings in it. They said that the bread was very thick and the insides weren't present enough. For the price now I guess you can't really complain. Seven dollars for a sandwich or for a salad right on the strip in Las Vegas really is unheard of.
Not sure why people rave about this place, I have played poker there many times and most of the players always say Earl is a must try. I was not impressed, it was overly priced for the size, the sandwich was not that good, it was bland and the only thing that saved my meal was the  bacon mac n cheese again that was over priced for the size of it. Maybe i am missing what everyone else see's in this place or i just ordered the wrong sandwich. I am a true believer in giving places 2nd chances, so maybe next time i am hungry at PH i will give them another go I will just try another sandwich.
Panera on crack, heroine, and speed.  Pretty much what Panera would look like if it was vacationing in Vegas.  Actually, I apologize Earl... for comparing you to your inferior shadow.. What's even better?  Come here after partying and shove your face full of pure elation on bread.  . A great recharge to your perpetual buzz in Vegas.
Yuuuuum!!!! Is all I can say. Love love love this place. This place is located in Planet Hollywood in near the shops and casino. We went around noon on a Sunday and there was a short line. Waited only a couple minutes to get to the cashier. Once we placed our order, we found a table and waited 5 minutes for our food. . . We ordered the chicken chipotle avocado sandwich, the pastrami Reuben and tortilla soup. Both sandwiches were delicious! The sauce in the chicken chipotle sandwich was so tasty. It had a slight sweetness to it. And the pastrami in the Reuben was very fresh. Usually, you'll get a rubbery texture from pastrami at places like subway or togos but the pastrami here was much like Ike's (if you've ever had it). It was easy to bite through. And the tortilla soup was sooo tasty. So many flavors going on in there! And the tortilla chips on too add a nice crunch to the soup. We dipped our sandwiches in the soup from time to time and it tasted delicious. . . Great place to go to if you want a satifying fulfilling meal at an affordable price. Will definitely come back to try the other items on the menu :)
Top rated eatery on the strip and it's opened 24/7-- what more do you need to know?!. . This place is great for multiple reasons:. 1) It's open 24/7. 2) It's cheap for all of us who lost every penny we had at the craps table last night ($6-$8 for a sammich). 3) It's fast. . Go with the Chipotle Chicken sandwich!
Simply the best!!! You need to try this place before you die.
Best sandwiches!!. Hawaiian bbq is good!
Three Words. Holiday. Turkey. Sandwich. That is my favorite sandwich ever! I cannot stop buying this sandwich whenever I come here. I also recommend their Tomato Soup when you buy your sandwich because it turns into the best dipping sauce for your sandwich. The other thing about this place is that it is cheap and they are either open 24 hours a day or they stay open late. You've got to come here! If you are in California, they do have two locations; one at Downtown Disney and one at Harrah's Casino in Rincon.
Very good Hawaiian BBQ sandwich.
I had the bbq chicken salad.  Nothing special at all.  The line was long, but it moved fairly fast so can't complain about that.  At least they got the order right.  Staff were very efficient and seemed very professional. The salad was edible and I got full...almost.  My coworker bought two sandwiches, both of which were on the smaller side, and he needed to eat them both to get full (and he is a skinny guy).. Why only two stars?  Diarrhea just 2-3 hrs after eating it.  My coworker later told me that he had the same issue.
Fast service and good food!
There is always a line that is brisk as of this sandwich shop whatsoever hours, as it's open 24 hours. Maybe the most effective value fast meal around the strip with prices starting at $5.49 for a generous toasted sandwich with all the fixings. The Complete Montague sandwich hit the spot, and my friends actually appreciated their Italian variants with cured meats. Ideal for right after hitting the clubs/bars.
I love love love this place. Anytime I come to vegas, i must come at eat here at least once. . The location is perfect, its in planet Hollywood right by the miracle mile mall. They are open 24/7 which is amazing! . . They took the bread and sandwich at the same time once its ordered it makes it delicious. There is normally a line there since they are pretty popular but the line more pretty smoothly. . . They have an earl grey tea lemonade which is just delicious! I have had most of their sandwiches and I haven't hated one of them they are all delicious.
Our go-to spot when we couldn't figure out where to eat. Sammiches were a little small but definitely tasty. It's a great place to grab lunch to start the day (because who starts Vegas days with breakfast?)
We read the great reviews of Earl and decided to try it for lunch.  Both sandwiches were just ok.  My Philly steak sandwich had me wondering "Where's the beef".
Best Reuben I've had for such a great price. It's flavorful and delicious. I would go back for the sandwich alone. The service however was complete sh*t. The guy at the register was an absolute A-hole and it took everything in me not to climb over the counter and choke him. But like I said... The sandwiches are worth it. . My gf had the ham, egg, cheese breakfast sandwich and she said it was one of the best she ever had as well. We may go back.
I absolutely LOVE this place!!. . They have so many options and so many different flavors I have a hard time choosing but their wraps are DELICIOUS!!! OH and the mac & cheese... I can eat 2 servings of this and be satisfied!!! The entire process from ordering and picking up is so smooth and the staff is super friendly.  . . Its open late so its a great place to get a bite after a long night of drinking!!! I've been twice and I love it!!! I know its a bit pricey for a sandwich,... ITS DELICIOUS!!!  . . I'm a fan... and I highly suggest ordering mac & cheese... its even better the next day warmed up!! :)
Long line....but they went really fast.  Sandwiches were good.  Had roast beef. With cheddar and horse radish  sauce.  The meat was so tender and the bread was nice and soft but toasted.   I also had the tortilla soup which was very tasty!
Second time back here. It's still the same, very meh sandwich.. . This time around I took my husband. He is surprises why this sandwich shop is so popular. He keep saying it's like Quiznos.. . The price is good. So I supposed if you don't want to spend a lot of money on food you can come here.. . It is open 24 hours too.
I tried this place for the first time after a friend recommended for us to try it.  Their sandwiches are delicious.  The bread was soft and the meats were cut just right and not too thick.  . . We were a party of 7, but luckily we were quick to get two tables to put together and ask tables near by for their extra chairs. :)  We received our orders fairly quickly, so that was plus.. . Everyone in our party really liked their sandwiches.  I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas.
I don't get what all the hype is about Earl of Sandwich. I've eaten here a few times and the sandwich is small (I need to order at least two) and the service is always slow. Looks like not everybody else here agrees with me but that is how I feel.
Earl of sand which is pretty good. It didn't blow my mind or anything but I like it. The bread is ciabatta style and toasted so it's nice and warm. . . A good place to stop in if you're at the Palms and looking for a quick meal.
Grabbed a quick breakfast here. It's your standard quick food with a tasty twist. The sandwich was good and the price was great!
I did not want to be risky and ordered HAM, EGG & CHEDDAR.. IT WAS SO GOOOOOOD.. . . Definitely coming back on my next Vegas trip!
You can't go wrong with earls.  Good prices and good food.  I always go here at least once in my trips to vegas.  Then line can be really really long, but here's my secret tip, just call in your order. It's ready in 5 minutes with no wait. Just try not to tell everyone.  It's in a great location in the middle of the strip just inside the planet Hollywood entrance by pbr rock bar, which is also pretty good.
Good food,  great price
Oh Earls, you're like a dear old friend who is always there for me in my time of need, whether I be drunk or hungry.  Although in most of the cases if I am here, I am probably drunk and hungry.  . . Pros:. . -24 hours, thankfully.  . -great service, I hope everyone is nice to the people that work here.  It's 3 am, and they have to deal with drunks at an ungodly hour.. -delicious sandwiches!  My personal favorites: chicken chipotle, tuna melt and the full montague just to name some.. -coleslaw!!  I absolutely love their coleslaw!. -their wraps are actually really good too!  Yay for variety!!. . Cons:. -longggggg lines, depending on what time you go, it moves relatively quickly but still.  No one likes waiting in line, although if you come with a few friends you guys can take turns testing your luck in the slots or tables.. -philly cheese steak is not that good, wouldn't really call it a philly cheese steak, way too plain.  By the way, this is the only sandwich I tried that wasn't good!. -limited seating. . All right, this is not a gourmet sandwich place so do not come in expecting to be waited on hand and foot.  It is a fast, casual place catering to the drunk Vegas masses.  I give it 5 stars because Earls holds a special place in my heart because it reminds me of how much fun I used to have in this exhausting city.  The food is good too, don't get me wrong, I will always love the Las Vegas, original Earls.  Disneyland Earls can suck it!
Hype alert!!. Hype alert!!!. . 10 minutes to fight traffic on the strip. . 15 minutes to walk from parking garage thru the shopping area. . 5 minutes for getting lost and asking direction,. and 20 minutes wait for ordering and waiting for that little bitty sandwich.. . Not worth it, guys.. . But I do have to admit the sandwich is better than Subway.
I was so hungover when I arrived at Earl of Sandwich that I do not even remember what sandwich I ordered. I do however remember that it was delicious and that my hangover magically disappeared after eating said sandwich. Thank goodness for the Earl without him I'm pretty sure I would still be on the floor of a bathroom somewhere in Las Vegas.
Earl's is always a must when in Vegas! They never close!  The Full Montague at 3 in the morning? Yes please!! Their sandwiches are delicious.  If you're hungry at crazy late hours of the night when you're in town I definitely recommend eating here.  Every time I've eaten here (which is usually in the wee hours of the night) the line is pretty long but it moves pretty quickly.  I live in Cali and have yet to visit the location in Anaheim.
One word...delish! I had the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich. It was slightly spicy, but not overpowering. The atmosphere is very casual. Price is awesome, since the quality of food is so good. You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer. I like table service better, but cannot beat the price and food. In Planet Hollywood Casino.
Great place for a late night snack.. . Food: 7.5 / 10 - Nice sandwiches and tons of selections.  Most look very tasty.. . Cleanliness: 8.5/10 - No problems.  Things were clean.. . Service: 7/10 - Nice ordering process. They give you one of those hockey pucks that vibrate when your order is done.  I head the wait can be long during the day but I have only visited this place late at night. . . Restrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.. . Parking: 8/10 - In miracle mile parking garage.. . Overall: 7.5 / 10 - Great place for a late night snack.
"Serf of Sandwich" is more like it.. . There doesn't seem to be any "Earl" like qualities about this place or the food for that matter.  The title of Earl is reserved for the aristocratic English nobility, and so it would seem that the sandwiches/products may or would exhibit some kind of high quality.  . Yes, it's cheap but it just seems ordinary to me.  In fact, my entire dining experience was not very memorable at all.  It all seemed like a bad dream and I couldn't wait to wake up so to speak.. . LOCATION:  Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.. . There is one line that forms for the ordering counter.  Menus are displayed above the ordering station/kitchen or near the waiting area for the line.  Various cold, hot and breakfast sandwiches available.  Admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu.  Sides and sodas (self serve) available as well.. . After looking over their menu I finally decided on the pastrami reuben.  I honestly can't remember the sandwiches my two friends had since no one took pics or seemed satisfied with their food.  We all shared sides of chips, and potato and pasta salads.. . FOOD:  . Just ok really.  My sandwich was just alright.  Priced at $6.49 I thought it would have been bigger and better (I'm really wishing I took a picture right now).  I think the three of us finished most of our food because we were hungry having decided to forgot breakfast that morning.  In any case, the food was somewhat acceptable.  The sides were just ok as well.. . SERVICE:  . Not great.  And here's a tip:  you don't pay for your meal when you order your food.  The staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  We arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.  There was only one staff ringing up customer at the pay counter and it seemed that the other staff didn't care or want to help the poor guy out.  My friends and I waited what seemed like an eternity to pay for our food.  . . side NOTE:  You can pick up sides, i.e. potato salad and chips, along the counter space between the order and pay stations.  . . WHY?:  Why aren't there more seats or a larger seating area since this place seems to so popular??  . . BOTTOM LINE:  I'm honestly not too sure why this place is so popular.  I thought it was alright.  There really should be a larger seating area for customers.
I had the Original, which was delicious! It was flavorful, and had just the right ratio of meat and cheese.  The wrap was also toasted which made it even better.  I also tried the Turkey holiday, which did indeed taste like thanksgiving in my mouth.
For the prices this place is solid.  The lines appear long but it moves along rather quickly.. . Original 1762 -Pretty good 4/5 - $7. Roast Beef sandwich, horse radish, cheese.  This sandwich is solid.  For the price, you can't beat it.  The bread is well toasted & has great texture.  The meat is really good too.. . My brother got the vegetable sandwich.  It was just OK.  It tasted like a vegetable lasagna dish you'd get at Albertons or something.  Stick to the meat stuff here.. . TIPS:. -Ask for extra horse radish sauce.
Food - Great!. Portions - small !. Line - long )-:. Fresh !. All an All - Great sandwich place !. Very recommended !
I have three words: Tuna. Melt. Sandwich.  And three more words: Oh. My. GOD!. . Seriously I don't know what they put in their tuna but it's soooo good! So simple but a definite winner: albacore tuna and swiss on their very own ciabatta bread. A must get every time I go to Vegas. Recently I tried the chipotle chicken as well. Reeeeally good but the tuna is still my fave.. . Another thing is they're opened 24 hrs. So to all the people who get drunchies, it's a good place to get your drunchies satisfied!
yummmmm.. hot and toasty
I don't know what the big deal is about this place.  They sell sandwiches for an average price on Las Vegas blvd.  The sandwiches are mediocre.  They are purely hype in my opinion and not worth the hoop la.   . . Short and simple: "nothing special"
Ultimately, its a fast food place located in Planet Hollywood that sells good sandwiches for a fair price. Nothing stands out about the sandwiches to me: I remember my sandwiches being good, but other than that nothing was memorable. . . If you're in the area and want something quick and affordable, then definitely give it a try. However, don't go out of your way to get it. A lot of the reviewers here seem to have got on a one-way ride on the hype train.
