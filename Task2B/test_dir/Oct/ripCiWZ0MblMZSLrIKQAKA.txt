My husband and I stayed at the Monte Carlo for the second time a couple of weeks ago.  It is not the most happening place but it is clean and the staff is great.  A couple of new eateries since the last time we visited were a nice a surprise -- didn't have to leave the hotel to get my gelato or morning coffee!
Nice clean spacious rooms. The bathroom was especially large. Great view from my 31st floor window. . . The bedding was comfortable and soft. The beds were not soft or firm. Just right. . . The location is what this hotel is really about. It's in the middle of everything. I'll be back.
Biggest disappointment!! The worst hotel I have ever stayed in for the price I have paid. You will literally feel cheated. The hotel is so dated. There's construction next door. I got keys to my room to find at least 8 moths flying around, dirty towel on the floor, dirty toilet with seat open, used ice, used plastic bag on the table. It was sheer disappointment as a start to Vegas trip. When I went back to the reception and complained, they didn't look too surprised and said the hotel has no plans for renovation till later next year and then it would take another year. Then I got a different room which wasn't much change. The lamp shades were torn and broken, the sheets grey and faded, the bathroom like a cheap motel, the mattress uncomfortable and the pillows flattened! When I said I want to cancel my reservation, they said I still have to pay $40 for each day of the reservation as a resort fee! I haven't even stayed there for 10 mins! BTW: this is a hidden charge that you have to pay in addition to the hotel fee.. . I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I will never ever return here either!
We stayed one night Oct 6th.  Arrived at shortly after 1pm.  There was a line 10 deep to check-in.  There were  about 10 agents checking in people.  The line moved quickly.  Room was a standard room-decent size and clean.  Pools were great, 3 pools and a jacuzzi.  Tons of chairs for both those who want the shade or sun.  Casino is average size, not too big, not too small- with a wide variety of games.  Access to the strip was very convenient. Kids loved "Licks", the candy store on the property.  Food court was convenient for a quick bite.  Overall, the property was great.  . . ps-used myvegas reward for the one nighr comp, which was easy to redeem-once u get the email, u call and book ur room.  u will not receive a confirmation email, which i thought was odd, but all went well!
I do not recommend this hotel at all! The rooms are dirty no joke!! Dirty floors , nasty uncomfortable bed! The restroom is disgusting the bath tub creepy old with mold! No wifi! No fridge!! If you want a fridge That's an extra $25 a day never heard of that before! The safe didn't work! The sheets had blood and they didn't want to give my boyfriend a refund we had to pay cancelation fees! It was just horrible!! Never again!!
This place is really old and in need of a full over haul. Rooms are outdated and bathrooms are dirty and look very moteli (if you know what I mean). Except for the lobby, the others parts are not so welcoming however casino and food court is really nice.. It's in good walking location of strip but the they are having construction going on right by the hotel and car entrance is a little bit tricky. . Guests can walk to Aria and City Center from the hotel where they can take tram to Crystal shops and/or Bellagio.. We didn't have eat at the buffet but took a look inside, food looks alright but not much variety comparing to the bigger buffets in Vegas. (we ended up having dinner at Bellagio buffet). There was a looooooong line at the front desk for the check-in but staff were friendly and willing to help. They have luggage storage for 1 day for free in case your room is not ready or you are checking earlier than normal check-in time and then they'll contact you (text probably) once the room is ready.. Hotel has 1 pool, 1 lazy river, one wave pool and 1 hot tub with beach volleyball. It's kind of behind the main building and goes to shade almost as quickly as around the early afternoon. (only some parts stay sun-lid afterwards). Lazy river tubes are for rent for 5 dollars with no time limit. Pool side bar is nice with lovely people always smiling at you and bringing your order as soon as they can. Towels are available at no cost.. there is a $22-23 resort fee per room per night which includes 2 bottle of water daily and wired internet at your room. You'd be able to connect to Wi-Fi only on 1st and 2nd floor.. Casino area is nice and black jack tables are widely open and available.. There is one $5 blackjack table next to the food court area which is always crowded.. It would well-said (as the other review mentioned) Vegas in the middle.
This has been the worst experience. My friends and I planned a 20 year reunion over 9 months ago and were so excited to come to Vegas! . There are moths in our room, the shower drips constantly, the check in person was so rude to us and every time we needed service we received lackluster responses. Turn down service is non existent. My friend had her shoes stolen out of her room and after basically accusing her roomies (us) stealing them, offered her 50 bucks and showed no care or empathy. . I come to Vegas often and will never spend another dime here. The rooms are dirty and the service is terrible. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!
I stayed 10/6/2014 thru 10/8/2014,  Very disappointed in this Hotel.  We reserved 2 adjoining rooms for myself and 4 friends with a strip view.  We were given 2 rooms that had a view of air conditioners and the end of a roller coaster.  Our sheets had rips in them and our towels were dirty. The toilets did not work properly. To say this place needs updating is an understatement.  Apparently they are under renovation, but neglected to inform us of this when we booked these over priced rooms.  Tried to get the manager to at least acknowledge some of the problems we were having, but we were told the hotel was 95% sold out so pretty much tough.  Not only will I not be staying here again, but will be sure to let all my friends know not to stay here as well.
Really nice and lovely quality hotel right off of the Las Vegas Strip, but close enough that it's like you're right ON Da Strip.. . My room was lovely.  I stayed here whilst the RODEO was in town.. . Ate at the buffet one night with a former boyfriend who tracked me down after I'd moved to LV and confessed he loved me.  Our romance rekindled here.. . Clean hotel.  Great bell check for my bags.  Really liked it.  Without having to pay a FULL Strip price.  Just a little savings.  Isn't that always fun?
The location of our $325 daybeds is pretty choice, but not worth the money. If you opt for the cheaper daybed solutions you will be sorely disappointed and in the shade for the vast majority of the day.. . The $325 daybeds by the lazy river do offer some grade A people watching, and since you're right up against the water there isn't a lot of traffic walking through your space.. . The food was in fact, extremely horrible. My sister (Jessica O.) also reviewed this place, and she hit the nail right on the head. Everything was hot and greasy, and generally of a very poor quality. This place even found a way to F up nachos. I don't know how, but they did it. . . The drinks were outta this world, lucky for us because we needed to spend $110 bucks a piece on them. . . The servers are good not great. The few servers I saw were attentive enough, but not overly friendly.. . The pool is great and definitely worth a visit. But don't bother with reserving day beds...and DO NOT eat here.
This hotel wasn't bad. It was my first time in Vegas and after walking around and seeing other hotels I will more than likely stay somewhere else next time but again it wasn't bad. It was affordable which worked for the group I was with. The only complaint I have was the bathroom in our hotel room. Wasn't very clean but everything else was fine.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #14:. a solid middle-range casino on a prime piece of real estate; wedged between Aria/City Center and the currently-in-building-process Las Vegas Arena and The Park areas; they have really upgraded this place, so while not all that big, it is a worthy spot, especially for mid-scale dining options; many of these are on the now-completed Strip-front walkway area; I challenge you to find a better deal for Strip-front dining than the inexpensive & super-tasty 800 Degrees (Neapolitan pizza); there is a small, but nice, shopping corridor with the best feature being The Pub (read on); best craft beer bet = by far, it's The Pub, which has a genuinely excellent beer list both on tap & in bottles; nice big space too, although I could do without the horrid dueling pianos bad-80's music when I was there; overall, the Monte Carlo rates at 3.5 stars, but I will bump them up due to The Pub and the Strip-front dining spots (BTW, the corridor walkway from the casino to Diablo's Cantina is pretty cool).
I have stayed at several hotels in Vegas and consider this my favorite, though it is not perfect.  It has a good location on the Strip, not far from the airport, by a bus stop.  It has a 24-hour food court and is across the street from Denny's.  The rooms are large, and I have always found the water hot and plentiful.  I have never had a problem with noise.  It often offers a food promotion.  . What are the negatives? It charges a $20 "resort fee" that is a total ripoff.  It sometimes charges an early check-in fee.  It does not have free wifi in the rooms but does in the lobby.  On my last visit housekeeping did not leave enough washcloths and towels for two people.  The food court is too noisy in its music.  The pool sometimes closes at 5 pm.. I would stay there again.
The hotel is getting a little dated.  It is located right next door to the new arena being built, which would be great once completed.  There are several other construction projects that make walking the strip a little difficult on this side of the street.  The hotel wifi is only available on the first 2 floors, which is lousy these days.  My bathtub faucet dripped all night and the fixtures could have been a little nicer.  The shower head was very low for someone 6' tall.  The food was decent, Overall for the price point, this is a 3 of 5.
This was my first time staying at the Monte Carlo in quite some time. I always remembered it as being a nice clean comfortable hotel. I was happy to see that it still is same. The staff is very friendly and helpful, hotel is clean. They have added a bunch of new dining options to this hotel since my last stay, and are still adding more to the hotel. My only complaint is that while clean and comfortable, the hotel part is starting to show signs of its age. Could definitely benefit in some touch ups and some new decor in the rooms. Room as free internet via ethernet, not wifi.
I have to give this hotel it's props.  Our room was very nice and clean.  Monte Carlo was on my list of hotels I want to stay in.  So far, I have stayed at Excalibur, Flamingo, Treasure Island, Harrah's & Tahiti Village (my cousins timeshare).  The timeshare and Treasure Island have been the best.  Flamingo, I would never stay again.  Monte Carlo I would definitely stay again.  . . The casino and everything about the hotel was a nice experience.  I enjoyed the buffet.  But my favorite is the Bellagio.  I have tried numerous buffets, but Bellagio stands out.. . My next adventure will be the Venetian.  . . I flew Allegiant Airlines for the first time.  We were 45 minutes late getting to Vegas.  And, in Vegas every minute counts.  I almost forgot to mention that I won $ 476.00 at the Palms Hotel & Casino.  . . I was not at all impressed with the Rio.. . But if you get a chance, try Monte Carlo.  The staff is great, and they try to help you as much as they can.  You get a $35.00 food & beverage credit.  Use it!!!   . . The quesadillas at "The Pub" are great!! And so are the Mai Tai's.
Another trip to Vegas and tried out another strip hotel casino. This one really has nothing special to offer that differs from the rest. Rooms could use a little updating. The pool was nice with a lazy river, which I always find to be a bonus. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Can't say I would like to come back for sure. But I bet I will come back just for gambling.
Four star? Not so fast.... Our room was eh. There's only wifi on the bottom two floors.. The pool was nice but had no shade and you have to stand in line at 9am to go put your towels out to even get a seat neat water. AND IT CLOSES AT 5PM.. WHA? Who closes a pool in the middle of the day in hot-a$$ Las Vegas???. The bright shining light here was the restaurant Yusho - YUM.
Moths in my room! . . It's been several years since I last stayed at the Monte Carlo, but since it was a pleasant stay then, we thought it would be a pleasant one again now. When I made my reservation I requested to add a note that I would be checking in late as I was expecting to arrive after midnight. When we checked in at 2:30am we were informed that because it was so late, they would have to give my husband and I a room with 2 queens instead of a king (which we were ok with, we were tired from travelling and just wanted to get into our room). The overall check-in process was quick with no issues and the person at the front desk was very pleasant. We got a room on the 15th floor, and as I opened the door I was startled with a large moth flying right to my face. Surprised, I stepped back and my husband proceeded into the room. As he turned on light above the doorway, 2 more large moths started flying in the room. We immediately knew we wanted another room, so I went to turn on the light on the desk to use the phone to call the front desk, and another 2 large moths were sitting on the lampshade! When I called the front desk to let them know there were moths in the room, the first response I received was, "Ok, I can send housekeeping up there to get rid of them for you." SERIOUSLY?! I informed her that I did not want that, I wanted a completely new room. She proceeded to find me another room on the 5th floor and transferred our keys, but then said "I can't guarantee that there won't be moths in that room either, because of the season, guests have been leaving their windows open." As I was talking with the front desk, my husband was checking around the room and found more moths in between the window curtains. We immediately went to our new room on the 5th floor, and thankfully it was moth free.. . We had a Deluxe room, and it appeared pretty dated but the beds were comfortable. There were not many available outlets in the room, and the ones that were available seemed loose. The shower had strong pressure to our liking, but did not drain quickly and I was always standing in ankle deep water by the end of my shower (and I didn't even take long showers). The water also leaked onto the floor when we showered, so we always had to put extra towels down. Our room was cleaned daily, towels & water bottled replaced. Employees we interacted with were very courteous. We also liked the proximity of the convenience shop & food court to the guest elevators. Other than the moth incident, the overall stay was just ok, but I don't think the Monte Carlo will be a first option for us the next time we go to Vegas.
My original review of the Monte Carlo was less than favorable but I am pleased to say my second stay has definitely changed my mind. The changes made in a year and a half were massive. The staff were all helpful and professional and the cleaning staff were extremely accommodating. The location is central and the tram to the Bellagio makes getting around very easy. Wifi isn't available in the rooms but is available on the 1st and 2nd floors and there isa business centre for printing. I will stay here again.
