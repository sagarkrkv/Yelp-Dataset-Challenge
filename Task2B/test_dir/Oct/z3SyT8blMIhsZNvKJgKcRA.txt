Contrary to what you may have heard... YES, Caesar's Palace IS pager friendly and also YES, Caesar DOES indeed live there. Had to... It's Vegas and the site of The Hangover. It's a must.... . It's been a while since I've stayed here but it's always been a nice one. Hard to beat Caesar's... It has everything. Several guest towers. Some newer and nicer than others. It has great dining options and in my opinion the best shopping destination still in Las Vegas with the Forum Shops. We were in town for a wedding actually taking place at one of the wedding chapels at Caesars Palace and it turns out, they do that rather well also... Caesars Palace really has it all and they do it well.. . My friends had a few rooms in the Augustus Tower at Caesars and I was really impressed. It's one of the newer towers and I see why people choose the Augustus to stay in. The rooms are nice and big with lots of space to walk around. The bathrooms are well appointed and has a separate toilet area enclosed by a door complete with phone.The view, from their rooms at least, was the lake of The Bellagio Hotel across the way and that was a different perspective. It was nice to see the water show from that side for once. But what I think is the cherry on top of staying at the Augustus Tower is that it has its own valet. That is such a luxury and one that's not lost on me as I always have a rental car when in town and I'm aware of the efficiency & ease of valeting at certain hotels. The Augustus Tower valet is a breeze. It's right there. Quick drop off, quick pick up. But I must say the main valet out front at Caesars is also very good despite it being such a huge resort and getting filled up often times. They've always accommodated me when I'm in a rush and need to valet and they are all filled up. I've never been turned away. I appreciate that and never forget it (tip well, of course). They'll remember you and you'll be taken care of during your stay for sure.. . I will definitely be staying at Caesars Palace on my future visits to Las Vegas and I for sure have my eyes on the Augustus Tower.
I love it here.  Everyone is happy and friendly. The pool was nice and relaxing. I ate at 5 different places.  Yummy at all 5. Love walking around the forum shops. It's just a happy place.  The cons of this place is the smell of smoke.  It seemed really strong. I had my kids with me. They had a blast.
Staying in the Palace Tower. Room smells like an ashtray. There was someone's moldy food in the minibar. No room in the minibar for your own stuff to keep cold. No free Wi-Fi. No new tech amenities. We went downstairs to have a nice drink and later a manager came over and started yelling at the nice bartender which ruined the moment. This casino is also really tight. Like the Wynn, they are in the business of making money and not catering to guests.  The buffet is good. The Payard crepe and sweets place is awesome. Pool is great. Gym is nice which are the only highlights. But again they try to deceive their guests at the buffet by having some machine where you pay an extra $20 to get through the line "quicker." Stick with the Bellagio if you want to be treated well or PH if you are on a budget. They did give us a better room which was very nice.
Caesars is my go-to Hotel on the Strip when I don't know people's tastes and I'm not sure about what shows I'm seeing or I'm definitely seeing something at Caesars AND I'm not here for a specific business reason.. . Everyone comes to Vegas for many different  reasons.  Here is the combination of reasons  I come here: a theme that doesn't bore me, good shopping, good variety of gaming tables, a good club (re-opening in April 2015), location at the 50 yard line of the strip, good variety of shows,  great service, and sister hotels that I can also visit to earn rewards.  All of that AND they have a great spa, pool and conference center which I have yet to experience.. . All of that is great but as a Total Rewards member I get comped or discounted for many things making the hotel a great deal and experience.  Make sure you become a Total Rewards member. There are many towers and I prefer to stay in the Augustus. The tower is closest to the front, near the spa, has great views and along with the Octavius Tower are the newest Towers ( other Towers such as the Japanese Themed Nobu are older towers that were remodeled).. . Remember that this is Vegas, so we are sticking to the facts and all "Hangover" references (indicated by a *) are coincidental.  . . As you pull up to the iconic entrance in your stolen police car*, make sure to note the fragrant smell as you go through the revolving doors.  For me that smell reminds me I'm at Caesars.  As you step into the circular reception area, you will note the iconic fountain where you will take that "I was at Caesar's photo".  You ask for the "Hangover Suite" (there really isn't one) handing over a $20 with your card hoping for an upgrade.  The receptionist likes your generosity and finds you the best available room she can find.  You walk over to the Augustus Tower and step into the elevator and take note of where Alan stood for his grand emperor moment*.. . As you enter the room make sure the  chickens don't escape* and carefully check out the spacious bathroom stocked with Qua products from the spa.  If you find a Tiger in your bathroom or a baby in your closet* you definitely will be in for a good time.  The room itself is spacious with 650 square feet of play space modern roman themed decor and a large marble bathroom with double vanities, spa tub, glass shower, and separate water closet.  Again the best rooms you will find for the price.  If you are holding a conference here these are the rooms you put your keynote speakers.. . On this particular trip I did not see a show, but highly recommend Absinthe.  The Bacchanal Buffet is very popular as well, but I am partial to Central by Marcel Richard which is located in the lobby across from the registration desk.. . My only drawback for this hotel is that on one occasion I did have a grifter on my floor try to sell me some "roofalus"*. On another occasion some guy tried to grift me out of some cash but this happens at most large hotels.  Just don't look like a target.
This was our first vegas trip. So nothing to compare it to. Beautiful hotel. Our suite faced belliago fountains. Tons to do if you aren't big gamblers. Love the huge jacuzzi tub. Tons of shops in the forum. ( it's a shopping mall).  So much to do. Most the staff are very friendly.
Got to visit this resort for just one night. But had such a great time we had to write about it. Super friendly staff. 550 sq ft room . Shower and jacuzzi. The swimming pool at this place is an experience in itself.. Got a smoking deal on Hotwire . Wished we could have stayed longer. Nice strip location with the linQs mall jus scrips the street.. Tons of shopping indoors too. Really liked it
Cesar's Palace - how do I love thee? Let me count the ways!. . 1. General outlay: GORGEOUS classical Roman architecture which I gazed upon often from my room window, the pool, the conference center balcony...big sigh... Your decor is elegant, classy without being the least bit tacky. Cesar's palace you are one beautifully adorned lady and I could walk your Italian marbled hallways and never tire of gazing at you!. . 2. Room: Was upgraded to a two queen non smoking room from my requested single king bed room in the Octavius tower overlooking THE POOL. Perfection. I lounged in her Jacuzzi bathtub, luxuriated in her waterfall shower, slept in a very comfy bed with ENOUGH pillows (I am a pillow hog).. . 3. Service: My dear lady has hired so many helpful and always friendly staff from the quick no-bother check in, the nice people who clean, the lovely folks working at the pool...every face had a smile.. . 4.Things to do: Where to begin? Huge casino with many open chairs at slots. Tables were full in the evening but many free seats during the day. Many restaurants, some of the best in Las Vegas but PLAN TO PAY ALOT. We stuck with Michel Richard's Central located in the main lobby. They have the BEST cosmo's on earth. There were shows there but we didn't go to one. We enjoyed standing at the main entrance watching all the dressed up super rich pull up in their limousines though.. . 5. THE POOL: Come to this place JUST for this lovely lady's pool. Several roman style pools about 3.5 feet deep scattered amidst plentiful chairs and literally beds to lay on in luxury. Wait staff will come around but not quite often enough so there's a food outlet with a "cocktail window" What's not to LOVE about a cocktail window?? LOL I'll never be the same after my blackberry mojito - dee-lish-ous! Amazing tiled pool floors, water fountains. I find I simply don't have adequate words to tell you how much I loved the POOL.. . Gambling: Not a big gambler but if you are on the squeamish side, I enjoyed playing the penny slots. It took me nearly 2 hours to lose 20 bucks there and I got 2 complimentary drinks. I also enjoyed the video poker (quarter single bet per draw) at the bar right in front of where the betting on sports games is going on. Sorry can't remember the name of it but you can't miss it. Had a wonderful Bailey's and coffee complimentary while playing - nice and STRONG. Highly recommend. . . Nice extras: Privacy button and a clean request button easily within reach from the bed. Hey, don't want to get up this morning? You can just roll over and flip a switch and no one will disturb you! You will WALK a lot. Now I'm a runner and struggle with getting enough exercise while traveling. Not at Cesar's! I put over 10,000 steps on my pedometer EVERY DAY. This is one huge place so if you have a hard time getting around, they have scooters for rent. Soaps and stuff in the bathroom are very high quality. I often do not use them. These I stuffed in my bag and took home :). . Minor issues to be aware of: You must pay for use of the spa/workout facilities- daily, you must pay for wifi -daily. The long hallway between the Octavius tower and the Bacchanal buffet smells like ass. I mean really bad. I have no idea why. People smoke everywhere but here's the deal - you barely notice. Cesar's has some amazing ventilation and I barely got a whiff of smoke. The food everywhere is EXPENSIVE so don't plan on staying at Cesar's on the cheap. In fact nothing at Cesar's is cheap, come with cash but in my opinion she's worth every penny!
Wow - I broke a tooth and the phone book gave a mobile dentist at the same address. It was close, so we went and asked the concierge. He recommended his family dentist, gave the address and told us where to get a wheelchair cab. We weren't even staying there! I am so pleased and sorry I didn't get back to thank him. I hope he sees this.
Let's make this simple.. . What I like:. - Great freakin' rooms.  I was recently upgraded to a suite on a high floor at the Augusts tower and the views were amazing.  Perfect view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  The beds were comfortable and the in room hot tub was kick ass.  . - Probably the best casino to stay at in Vegas if you're a hardcore shopper.  The Forum shopping area is huge and has a great variety of luxury and mid-level brands.  I often find myself buying the most stuff here (aside from the outlet mall) when I'm in town.. - Huge gambling floor.. - Baccannal Buffet is great.  Totally love the great selection of food ever since the big renovation a couple of years ago.. - The colosseum is a great venue for shows.. . What I don't like:. - Huge gambling floor also means lots of gamblers - and that means it gets pretty smokey here after awhile.  That's saying a lot when I'm a smoker myself.. - Can get pretty expensive to stay here versus other casinos of comparable quality.. - Not exactly the cheapest place to gamble.. - Wish their famous restaurants didn't feel like it was all ripped off from NYC (Nobu, Mesa, Serendipity, Old Homestead .. etc)
Let me first say that this hotel is impressive. The decor is fantastic. I'm a history junkie so I was very excited to be staying here. I'm staying at the Palace Tower and my room is amazing. . . All was well until the third day. I returned to my room to find strangers' things in it. I had asked housekeeping then bell desk to find out if they had any idea where the bags had come from and the individuals I spoke with had told me that they had no record of having put anything in my room. I was then referred to security. They had taken my report and told me that they would look into it. Later in the day when I had called to ask for an update, I was passed around to different individuals. I had to describe my situation to each one. Very frustrating. On day four, the security staff person who took my report called to ask me for any updates from the night before (after shift change). What?!!! Today is day four and Caesars Palace has yet to provide me with a report of what had happened and reassurance that it will not happen again and that I can feel safe in my room. To me that is unacceptable. Makes me wonder if they took my report seriously. Maybe if I was a high roller, I'd be more important to them. . . To add salt to injury, only hours after the first incident, I was woken up at 4:30 am by security and housekeeping because of a flood. I'll not get into further details but it took a long time before I heard from guest services if I had to move rooms, etc., etc.
Never will I ever stay here again. Dont get me wrong it is a beautiful hotel and perhaps if they had put me in a different tower I would have been happier...I was in the Roman tower....OMG...we fought over who would charge their phone first because they were lacking outlets....there were no available outlets....only in the bathroom....which was really nice by the way. The beds were really comfy....This was a super smoky hotel...If you smoke then it wont bother you but I dont and have really bad allergies so I was uncomfortable. The staff was great...I would recommend this hotel for gamblerswho only want to hang out and eat... the food in this hotel is pricey....nothing less that $30...the drinks at the different bars are also up there. I got a captain and ginger ale in a small glass and paid $12....the clubs that they had were not frequented. They cleopatra barge was only open to those who paid for a show and if you didnt walk passed early you couldnt see the boat sitting on the small pond ...which was really cute....btw its closed during the day. On a good note the hotel is a sight...the pools are great...Went to the venus pool wanting to be adventurous ....was going to participate in the european style sunbathing and ....no one was topless...so I didnt want to be the leader...they had a dj for that pool but you can hear the dj at all of the others as well. Keep in mind at the venus pool it is free for ladies but if you want to sit in the pool chairs it is a $40 bar tab you must sacrafice ....there are feel pool chairs right nextdoor...so not worth it....to me...
Terribly overpriced.  15 bucks for internet?  20 bucks for a fridge?  Two bucks extra for lettuce and tomato?. . Definitely not staying here again.  Theres a massive lack in value.
Caesars is one of those place that is just grand!  It's big, it goes on forever and it has lots of ornate!  I like the shops, I like the sculptures.  Never have stayed here but, I see their prices are dropping and possibly may be in a future Vegas trip of mine.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes to shop, or like lots of decoration to entertain their eyes!
Here for convention. Our company is spending a lot of money and time in Vegas and Caesars this month. I have had TERRIBLE service from this hotel. Got here and they were unorganized and not prepared for lines at check in. Then, I have a very important package delivered to the hotel for meeting tomorrow .  After a dozen phone.calls and two visits to the main desk to try to get my delivery,  I have been told they are TOO busy to get my package to me. This is unacceptable. If you are here for business, good luck.
They were running a special on a Sunday night and we booked a room for $100. The man at the front counter upgraded us to a deluxe room and it was amazing! Two bathrooms, a whirlpool jet bathtub, amazing view, king bed- too good to leave the room. We were definitely spoiled- but the restaurant options, shopping areas, and games were all amazing. Definitely coming back!
I stay here usually. Mostly because I love the salon. Go to color salon and have any service done, and you will be beyond happy. The spa is also very nice. They have re done it so there are a lot more steam rooms and cool rooms. I like the location of this hotel. I Prefer to stay in the Augustus tower and come in on flamingo road entrance. No crowd or wait. Fast check in. Obviously you can't beat the forum shops. Room service is not good, but luckily there is a Starbucks beside the elevator
Pokud vam neni minimalne 21 let, nema cenu snad do USA letat :D protoze velice resi vek a jakmile jste tam s nekym starsim, nenalejou ani jemu jen protoze je tam osoba pod 21 let a hned vyhrozuji ochrankou. Jinak samozrejme mesto hrichu doporucuju navstivit ;)
This was by far the worst hotel experience I have had during my many trips to Las Vegas. I expected "Caesars" to be a top notch hotel with a modern feel and excellent service not a "run down" "your on your own" approach. Im not sure where to start but here it goes. First off I needed a frig for some medication. They wanted to charge me $20 but after talking to them they waived the fee and made me feel like they were doing me a favor by giving me a frig that other hotels provide as a standard for their rooms. The frig came 3 hours later and I had to call guest services to remind them. Good thing I had ice and a small ice chest on standby. When the frig came it looked like it had gone through a war and functioned poorly. Second the room was very outdated. The bedding was poor, a few of the lamps and electrical outlets were not functional and the furniture was mismatched/faded. Third was the view. I know I didn't pay for a room with a strip view but could I maybe get a view of the freeway instead of looking out the window at a concrete wall with a ladder. I think a jail cell would have a better view of the outside world then the one "Caesars" had. Fourth they said at the front desk that I would be charged $25 for the resort fee but at checkout they charged me $28 per day for the resort fee. With the price that "Caesars" charges for their rooms you get the room quality of a motel and not a Las Vegas Resort. Bottom line is I was so disgusted and angry about the hotel quality, money I paid to be there and the service that it ruined my trip. I was so mad that I didn't even gamble one cent in their casino and will never set foot at "Caesars" again. If you are contemplating staying in that area of the strip just stay at "Treasure Island". TI has modern rooms, good service, outstanding amenities, and all at a price point that Caesars cant even dream to accomplish. DONT BOOK OR STEP FOOT INSIDE this sorry excuse for a Las Vegas Resort. Learn from a guy who works too much and wanted to enjoy a nice break with my wife in Las Vegas. We were cheated out of a wonderful experience by "Caesars" and at our own financial expense.
