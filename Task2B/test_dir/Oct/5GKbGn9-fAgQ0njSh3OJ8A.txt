Really great Italian food and great atmosphere. I usually go here for birthday dinners when I visit Vegas, it great for big groups or couples. . . What's amazing:. Chicken marshals. Meatball w/riccotta (this is a massive meatball)
We waited 45 minutes for our Oreo dessert and it came with melted ice cream and did not even compare to the deep fried Oreos you find at a county fair. The atmosphere is loud and un romantic. If you're into the club scene you will like this place better. The server was a very sweet girl who was very nice.
Lavo is a great place not only for fabulous food but also the nightclub is enjoyable with great music! Went to dinner last night and the charbroiled octopus is to die for (great meaty inside with a crispy outter char). The raw oyster bar is always a must have and presented very pretty! I am a fish fan as I do not eat meat and I had the Dover Sole with brussel sprouts and it was excellent. My date had the sea bass and the fish was very flaky and moist as well. Did not do dessert this time but will definitely have to try the choc cake I saw - it was a girls birthday and this choc tower cake came out as well as the waiter with the wooden Lavo paddle! She got a birthday spanking; very cute birthday touch ;).
Located in the Palazzo Hotel/Casino, Lavo is a dark and sexy Italian restaurant and bar. There is a full bar with loads of speciality Martina's and cocktails, Jon Bon Jovi stood next to us enjoying some beverage while a DJ played some subtle techno music. It wasn't very loud, but definitely had a cool urban feel. . We were seated at our table inside for 10 people (there is also seating on the balcony) and ordered a variety of appetizers; the seafood tower on ice, fresh muscles, clams, prawns, crab legs, delicious! Grilled eggplant, Kobe rice meatballs and bruschetta came out next, everyone commented on the nice quality.  For dinner I ordered spaghetti Fra Diavolo with grilled prawns (spicy and delectable), hubby had the ahi tuna (loved it). Everyone commented on their meals being savory and well made. We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert, probably the best I've ever had (thyme biscuits went well with the fresh strawberries and creme).  All in all the ambiance, food, service (our waiter was very attentive and friendly) was A+.
Surprised that they were open late. Nice to know for the future, goo pasta dishes, minestrone soup needs more flavor.  Outside seating was nice. Note sure if they put heat lamps out soon but this night was enjoyable and if available I would recommend.
The house special is the spaghetti and meatballs. The serving was modest  and I did not find anything exceptional. It was good but over priced for the portion and quality. Service was ok but again not noteworthy.
The ambiance is nice at Lavo, but the service & food were unsatisfactory. Had Saturday brunch outside on a beautiful day with friends, however, when I ordered the hamburger & it was served, I asked for mustard. That's when the silliness by the wait staff began. First, the waiter said he would go get it. Then, approximately 5 minutes later, he came to the table & said they were out. When I told him I couldn't believe a restaurant that serves burgers would be out of mustard, he laughed & said that the head chef actually hates mustard & refuses to have it in the restaurant. I had not realized the burger had already been covered with mayonnaise, which I can't eat. The fries that accompanied the burger smelled awful and apparently had been fried in some sort of truffle oil. The meat was overcooked. All in all, a pretty bad meal with a big price tag. If you're looking for a great American hamburger, although it's on the menu at Lavo, skip it. After this experience I won't be going back.
Went for the party brunch and man it was such a blast. Great atmosphere, drinks and food. Chicken parm and waffles were also awesome.
LAVO Brunch is so strange. It's pretty much ratchet night clubbing during the day. But don't get it twisted with Vegas pool parties; LAVO is on a whole 'nother level.. . I really wanted to go day clubbing but Marquee Dayclub Dome was closed over the weekend and all other pool parties had ended for the season. When my promoter suggested LAVO Brunch, I hopped on the opportunity. None of my friends wanted to go, so it was just Craig P. and me.. . We arrived around 3 pm and thanks to my promoter, both of us walked in for free without a wait. The moment we stepped in, I regret my decision. It was crazy inside. LAVO is an actual restaurant with dining tables all around. People were dressed to the nines, brunching, eating on dining tables, and DANCING on them, along with several go-go dancers. The restaurant is dimly lit, misty, and foggy inside. We weren't trying to get pussy misted at three in the afternoon so after a 5-minute walk-around, Craig and I were over it and bounced.. . If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, then by all means, come and have fun! It's about $100-150 per person if you want a table, brunch, and bottles. But if you're looking for something more chill, like Marquee Dayclub or Encore Beach Club, LAVO is not the place.
