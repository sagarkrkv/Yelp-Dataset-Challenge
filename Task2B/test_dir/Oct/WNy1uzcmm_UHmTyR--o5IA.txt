Yeah so I ended up in Phoenix one day and got off the plane and said yo what up son.  My cousin said we would go get some Pasty's.  Uhh the hell do I want to cover up my nipples for I asked.  But noooo, these are like other reviewers have said, fancy hot pockets or giant dumpling...!. I feel like everything at night in AZ is dark cause your windows are blacked out.  It gives a strange sensation at night...maybe it's just me.  But this place was pretty dark outside.  . Greeted immediately upon entering...always a great first impression.  The interior was dark but decently lit.  Seating was primarily either the bar or long communal tables w/ benches.. They play some cool metal/alt music that must be local or unsigned cause shazam wouldn't even pick that up.. I went straight for the "Premium" section and got a Tandoori Chicken Pasty.  So the pasty itself is cut in half but it's a little difficult to eat like a hot pocket since it does fall apart, so you're better off with utensils.  But I'm a savage so I eat with my hands...take that pasty.. Don't forget the fries!  Garlic!  With Jalapenos!  Fresh cut, some skin, and nice and crispy!
We love the place. Any attire will do! My friends had a great time. Price is much cheaper that the others. We had the Royale w/ cheese and it's awesome it will give you the meat sweats and chicken pot pie. We also love Portobello Chicken Pasty with a side of marinara - delicious!
Not a bad palce.
Very unique, flavorful and a nice change from the usual pizza, burgers and salads.  There are so many different choices of pasties ranging from breakfast to dessert and everything in between.  Each one we tried was very good and couldn't wait to try the next.  There is honestly something for everyone, no matter what your taste or diet.  Staff was very friendly, customers were having a great time singing to the music and I can't wait to return to try the other flavors.
We were looking for something a little different when I found this gem. It was around 10pm, and they are open late! Really cool looking little pub. Warm wood, dimly lit, and friendly staff. The Pasty was delicious especially with the red wine gravy (I could almost drink that stuff). The only bad thing I can say is, I think it's a little pricey for what you get, they should throw some fries on the plate or something. Everything else was great!
Definitely one of my faves. This place is perfect!. All pasty will be cooked to perfection and takes about 15 min. We come here about 1 a week.. Great music and good beer complete your selection.... . Ah, and if you have any space left, try the dessert... one mode delicious than the other!
Interesting business indeed, the place is setup like a hangout for either vampires or individuals with hangovers except that terrible music they play is turned up way too loud for the latter.  Really, the only thing this place has going for it is the fact that there are indeed worse places out there.  To start, the staff are completely lackadaisical and couldn't care less about you being there.  Second, not only is the menu a complete fail but the food itself is even worse.  On a nutritional scale the fair scores about a 2 yet it is not even remotely enjoyable.  The food seriously has zero flavor, if they changed to strictly boiled chicken with no seasoning I'd be a step up.  Thisplace takes the cake for the least flavorful food of any restaurant I've ever been to.  To boot the seating is as uncomfortable as could be found anywhere and the bar is pretty weak as well.  I'm not quite sure of the reason for this restaurant's existence.
Omg the most delicious pasties! I split the traditional pasty and chocolate bread desert with my husband. We were both stuffed at the end, and very satisfied. Dessert is enormous, we couldn't finish. I will definitely be back.  Want to try everything on the menu!
http://www.cornishpastyco.com/. . Its whats for dinner....had potato leek soup and chicken pesto pasty. Loved it so much got a Pilgrim for.the next days lunch, and a cinnamon apple w/vanilla ice cream for dessert.
OH MY GOD!!!. Yelp is the best thing since space travel!!!. . I would have never found this place, and it is AMAZING!!!  . . Note:  it's BEHIND the Mexican food place - I almost drove away - very glad I didn't!  . . I can't even describe in words how amazing the Shepherds Pie is!!!  The lamb is OFF THE HOOK!!!  Some sort of red wine gravy / sauce...  I could drink it straight! . . You know the kind of meal that makes you sigh, relax a bit and remember your grandmothers house?  Yeah - that's this place.... . The staff looked like a mix of biker gangs and turned out to be the friendliest people in Phoenix!!!  . . Got hooked on Crabbies Ginger beer there too!  You'll have a GREAT dinner!!!  Enjoy!. . PS: asked about desserts- BOOM!  Some sort of caramel pie with whipped cream and bananas!  Insane!!!  It's like eating diabetes!
The pastry is a place to get lost in. It's so dark and moody and the tables so long you can bring a big group and have a great time. Really cool bar that reminds me of and older style diner. Have to try one of the pastries. It's basically a hot pocket with really fresh ingredients to describe it for a philistine. Bring some friends and try this place out!
Our server was Casey and all I have to say is WOW! She was so friendly an acomidating! She explained everything about the menu an recommended some great dishes! We had the wings, which were outstanding! We also had the Italian pasty! It was delicious! Thank you Casey for making this a night to remember! We will definitely be telling all our friends about this little jem!!!!!!
I loved this place. The atmosphere was very chilled out and the service was fantastic. I ate a chicken portobello pasty under the recommendation of the service and it was to die for. I highly recommend this place.
