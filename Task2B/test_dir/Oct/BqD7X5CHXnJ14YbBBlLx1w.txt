Stepped in for some tapas and sangria before our dinner.  We sat at the bar and had a great time. All the tapas we had were delicious, sangria (there's 3types!) were refreshing and yummy, and the waiters were wonderful.  We had a great time and almost forgot about our dinner reservation elsewhere.
Came here for an early dinner for six of us and was able to catch the end of happy hour. We ended up just ordering 2 of every tapa on the happy hour menu so that each person got to try one of each. Didn't even really bother to look at the menu as I think all of us were too lazy to pick out what we didn't want :P We also got a paella along with 4 pitchers of sangria (part of the happy hour menu) which may have been overly ambitious :D 2 pitchers of red and 2 pitchers of white. We were struggling to finish all the alcohol. For the most part, everything was excellent, I just wasn't too big of a fan of the stuffed date (not too into sweets in general). I don't remember all the food we got but some of the items included: potatoes bravas, meatballs, chicken croquettes, calamari, and chorizo. With the happy hour prices, our bill actually came out to less than what we were anticipating which made it a pretty good value for a fancier meal with copious amounts of alcohol.
Even though I am not a huge fan of tapas style of serving and portions I figured I'd give it a go anyways. Well the food being cold and barely having any flavor was something that could have been avoided. I would have just put up one star but the gazpacho was actually pretty good so there is the redeeming factor.
The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the bartender messed up the drink orders- aside from that, the food is phenomenal !!!! I would definitely recommend the mushroom soup, salmon and rib eye. Delicious!
The food was good, not great. It was way too loud for us, we had a hard time hearing the waitress and could barely hold a conversation.  The red Sangria was tasty.
Divine!   Great atmosphere and fabulous food.  My husband and I shared the potatoes.... Amazing  ( not sure of the exact name) they came with a great aioli dipping sauce.  We also had the fried artichokes ... Delicious , and a grilled bread appetizer .. This however was minuscule but very good. . The service was terrific , the waitstaff bustle about serving you the food and quickly taking away empty plates!   I will come back to try other "tapas"
Good tapas, expensive and a little inconsistent.  When we were seated some people were telling us "get the scallops."  We tried those and got three small scallops for $14.  Tasty, but I was thinking I would be leaving there hungry with a light wallet. Then I was thinking we would not order more. The morcillo was a better portion though.  So we ordered the tortilla Espanola.   That was a very nice wedge.  The red sangria was very good, at $10/glass.  For desert, the flan was mediocre and the arroz con leche was excellent.
I enjoyed the restaurant, atmosphere and food.  Really great first impression when you walk in, colorful space and a great spot in the Aria.  I think the tapas idea is great but it is definitely a spendy meal for not a lot of food.  It is the type of restaurant that you need to go grab a cheeseburger afterwards to really fee full.  Our favorite dishes were the scallops, spicy meatballs and the tenderloin over grilled bread.  I was a little disappointed with the steak tartare as it almost had a meatloaf consistency.  I'm a pretty traditional tartare eater though so I was missing the typical flavors and presentation.  . . I'd try it again, it's a fun place for a big group.
Food was decent. Service was good at first but certainly tailed off towards the middle and end of dinner, not good for a tapas place.
Good, not great. My wife and I ordered a charcuterie plate, ox tail, lamb kabobs, lobster tail pasta and the ceviche. All plates were pleasant, but none were memorable.  The service was satisfactory, but i think our waiter forgot to put in our order of lamb kabobs, which came out a bit tardy for the party. Not a big deal though, we were actually quite full already. Good restaurant, nice atmosphere, but i doubt i'd go back.
That I have dined here twice in one year, is testimony to the fact that if you don't dine here while you are in Vegas, you are losing out on fine food & a good experience.. . But you need to make sure you have enough money, lest you be eating Ramen for a while.... . With regards to the food, what's not to like?!. Paella - good.. Sangria - good.. Mushroom risotto - good.. . Wait, tapas here in general, good :)
Had a great experience here with a large group of people. Great food and good service. I will definitely be back.
Love the tapas here! Stopped in for a quite bite during happy hour. HH prices and portions are food for Vegas standards. . . I love their tuna cones (not on HH menu). The gambas (shrimp) was my fav dish, ask for some house bread to dip all the delicious red sauce in! I always get the crispy baked chicken dish, its a simple dish but the chicken is cooked to perfect; juicy and crisp. Fried calamari was good; crispy and meaty, not dry sad pieces. The stuffed dates were a bit too sweet for my liking. The meatballs and sliders were just ok, but my friend liked it. . . The sangrias aren't that strong but they're yummy.
Restaurant is gorgeous, service was excellent, but the food left something to be desired. Each dish we ordered seemed to be lacking a certain component. I'll stick to Jaleo as my go to tapas place in Vegas.
I came here for my brother's wedding rehearsal dinner. My parents had agreed upon a set menu that was sent to my parents to review. My father found quite a few spelling mistakes that he corrected and sent back, some of which had not been changed by the time we arrived for dinner the next day. . . We paid for multiple small plates and unlimited sangria. I was beyond shocked that after my first glass of Sangria, when asking for another I was told it was no longer being served. After spending a lot of money on this meal, I was in complete disbelief that he would not give me what we paid for. I didn't make this a big deal because the night wasn't about me, but after telling my father (who had paid for the entire meal), he was upset that we didn't get our full monies worth. . . Other than that, service was great!
So...it's Vegas and I know that there are many, many great restaurants to choose from but I was seriously impressed with the food and the service at Julian Serrano.  From beginning to end, the meal was flawless.  Special tip of the hat to the sommelier who was uber helpful with our wine recommendation.  I feel sometimes they come off as being snotty or condescending but he was neither.  . My work compatriots and I pretty much exhausted the menu choices.  Everything was spot on but a few standouts included:. . Braised oxtail. Pintxos de chorizo. Albondigas. . Come with a large party (and an expense account) and leave happy.  I guarantee it!
Amazing service! I came and sat at the bar while on a work trip to Vegas.. I've been studying for a wine exam and decided to sit at the bar and drink some Spanish wine while I studied my chapter on Spain. The bartenders especially Jason were so gracious and let need try anything I wanted to taste to aid in my education. what a memorable and fantastic experience I loved it so much. Great restaurant great wine and great service a must try while in Vegas
I would never ever ever go back here again the food was average and I understand it's Tapas but the Tapas was so small that a toddler would not of been satisfied...would never ever ever go back again!
