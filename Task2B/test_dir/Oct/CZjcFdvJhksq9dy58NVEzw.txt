Overrated. Not like it used to be. You wait like 2 hours to get food and all the food is just ok. Spend your money somewhere else and spend less time waiting.
What has happened to the Bellagio dining options?!?!?!?!?!?  This used to be my favorite Vegas buffet.  If going definitely do not go for lunch as the selection is terrible.. . Lunch menu = salad bar, shrimp, a few random dried out entree choices.  . . There is no dim sum and no crab legs at lunch!!!!!!  Rather disappointing.
The Bellagio is considered one of the best properties on the strip - so how bad could the buffet possibly be? Well, think again. . . I'll just throw out a few of the oddities that struck me to make my lunch experience a truly miserable one. . . First, lunch was priced at 19.99 per the Bellagio website; when I arrived, I was inexplicably charged 24.99 plus tax. And, yes, it was a Monday. Add A Tip, and you're almost at twice the listed price for lunch. . . 2) The tables are tiny. Even lunching alone, I had trouble even fitting one plate, one drink, and my cutlery. . . 3) There is no indication as to whether drinks are included in the price. There is no drinks menu. I still don't know if I could've gotten wasted on buckets of Lager or had a glass of champagne. . . 4) While there is a cotton napkin - SINGULAR - there is nothing else you could put your fork and knife on as the napkin sits on your lap. So, throughout your buffet experience, your fork and knife will sit right on the ageing, dirty-looking wodden tabletop with hygienic (!) tile inserts. I really had to struggle. Would it be so hard to just supply either two cotton napkins or at least a paper napkin to set your cutlery down? . . 5) Going along the same lines, the plates are amongst the flattest I have ever seen. Who needs deep plates with oil and vinegar, pasta sauce, or other liquid food components? And, as you might have guessed, you WILL end up spilling vinegar or oil or whatever it is all over your wooden table - which drastically works together with number 4) to ensure that you don't have a napkin to wipe clean the mess - so you end up with a table too small, full of oil, vinegar, and with no dry space to set your fork down!. . 6) Did I mention that the drink comes with plenty of ice, but no cardboard set? Condensing water just adds to the oil-vinegar mess that already burdens your table. . . 7) Whoever set up the actual buffet stations should be publicly flogged! Soup station: The soup ladle is TOO LONG to maneuver between the protective glass roof and the soup kettle! How on earth are you supposed to get your soup if you keep wiggling the ladle between the glass roof and the kettle???? Next station: Wood-oven Pizza. While the Pizza does look good, to reach the back row under the yet again too low glass divider, there is no way to fetch a slice without drenching your cuff IN front-row Pizza. Despite being REALLY annoying, I am shocked to see that the health department apparently does not see reason to intervene. I truly had to puke a little when I saw this setup!. . 8) I don't really remember what the food selection was like; I was too busy trying to forget about the Bellagio Pizza (Spinach, Mushrooms, and patrons' cuff). But what I do remember is that there were sausages, BUT NO KETCHUP. There were sausage links - BUT NO MUSTARD. . . 9) Lastly, the checkin section is a joke. There are three randomly positioned cash desks at the entrance - once you're done paying, though, you are thrown in turmoil yet again. The line to the hostess actually requires you to backtrack to where you come from- resulting in chaos as people who are trying to pay stand alongside a queue of folks that already paid. Did I mention that your receipt is handed over to you stapled i n a real awkward way that prevents you from putting it into your pocket? So you stand in the waiting flock (it certainly ain't a queue) - with your semi-circular receipt in hand? . . Don't be fooled. All these 4 and 5 star reviews must be from folks who don't know any better and who are surprised that the Buffet at the Bellagio offers a selection beyond Arby's. I, for my part, was shocked, and am glad to leave this place.
My family and I went to the Buffet at the Bellagio. We couldn't have been more pleased. It was absolutely incredible. From our amazing helpful staff to the superb crab legs and desserts! I highly give this buffet a top recommendation on your next trip to Las Vegas.
I have been to so many buffets in Vegas for lunch and dinners and this is by far one of the best. If you're a buffet person, you should give this one a try.. So many varieties and food selections. Food quality is above average and you can almost find any type of food you could imagine. Italian station as well as steak station are among the best. If it's a holiday or an occasion, there is usually a waiting line but you'll get seated pretty soon.. One fact that people are neglecting is you can never expect high-end menu restaurant food quality from a buffet, considering this in mind, I'd say Bellagio is a good choice, and I repeat, if you're planning to have buffet meal.. Dessert station is really nice with so many options.. Staff are friendly but they're busy and it could take them sometimes to check up on you.. One advice is going to buffet toward the end of lunch time, this way you'd pay for the lunch which is normally cheaper and you can sit through the dinner and enjoy the added items for dinner as well.
Ok the dinner buffet was not so bad. Of course and judging it by being a little bit buzzed from the happy hour drinks I had earlier. The dinner is reasonably price especially for being on the strip, you can have as much crab legs you want or shrimp, and all the red meat you can desire.. . Even if you're at the line the line does go by real quick I ended up being here with 4 of my crew mates. And literally we're seated and less than 2 minutes. As we are picky eaters, there was a wide assortment of different types of food.
Like many of the Vegas buffets, there is a huge selection, but bellagio's food quality is average/borderline bad.. . Pros:. -their weekday dinner buffet ends at 10 (instead of 9pm like wicked spoon). -good, diverse dessert selection. -they have snow and king crabs (delicious). -their sashimi mix was scrumptious (had both salmon and tuna). . Cons:. -their service can be a little slow. We had to look for a waiter to get us our water/drinks. -came at 8:40pm and there was still at 20min wait for the dinner buffet (left us with 1 hr). -I was so excited to see that they had macarons, but it was just...bad. The middle part was just jam...what.. -they had a lot of food, but there was only one or two dishes that I really enjoyed. There's something off about the food quality here.. -dinner on weekdays was $34, but I still don't think it was worth the price . . Pass. There are better buffets/restaurants in Vegas (eg: burgr by Gordon Ramsey)
Quality control at its poorest! I spit out the pad Thai, I couldn't cut the meat with a sharp knife, the crab was too salty (you have to request to boil them to made edible). Bellagio, I expected more from you...
Quality buffet at a reasonable price. Lots of desert selections. Selection is not as good as Mirage, but the quality is a little bit better.
Sorry but very disappointed about this buffet , it's the freaking Bellagio ! . Cons:. - No visual appeal , sorry but you eat with your eyes first and this buffet look nothing spectacular . No cute presentation, regular dishes used for dessert, old school ice cream machine . The last buffet we did was The Wicked Spoon and we loved the presentation . . - NO OYSTERS!!!!! Seriously at $43 , you would think they had a bigger seafood selection. - Side dishes was like at a Hometown Buffet. - Desserts nothing special, no macaroons, no gelato . - The sushis selection was also very limited. . Pros:. - We had good service, plates were always removed pretty fast.. - They do offer  3 kind of caviars, I love ikura, they also had steak tartare and very yummi ahi poke and salmon poke .
Not a fan of buffets but this was decent. There was variety for everyone,,,beef, pizza, veggies, seafood and sushi.  They seated us together as a large group and the place was cleaner than most buffets I have been to.  Just don't eat the sushi...I had a tuna roll and it made me sick. I think the fish had been sitting out too long and I shouldn't have eaten it after it didn't taste quite right. . Everyone else was satisfied with the buffet.... . a little pricey though.
I haven't been to the buffet at the Bellagio since 2000.  I have many fond memories of eating there 14+ years ago and thought it was time to go back.  What a mistake.. . Most of the food is low quality.  None of the prep staff in the kitchen knew of the specific ingredients in any of the food (I have a few intolerances... corn, soy, etc.), and many of them couldn't even speak English so I had a hard time figuring out what I could eat.  This has never been an issue at places like Aria Buffet, Bacchanal Buffet, or Paris Buffet (all of which are exponentially better than the Bellagio).. . I was so disappointed. This is the first time leaving a buffet hungry because I just couldn't risk eating food that I couldn't get ingredient info on.
My girlfriends and I had the lunch buffet during our stay in Vegas. There wasn't much visual appeal to the place and the buffet was  also mediocre. Not as great as I thought it would be. There's definitely better brunch options out here in Vegas!
I checked out The Buffet at Bellagio on a Friday night. The group I was with were looking for the right combination of a good buffet and a reasonable price. The Buffet at Bellagio, based on a few online reviews I read, seemed to meet those requirements,. . Then I walked in.. . First of all, they charged me a $47 "holiday rate" because of Columbus Day weekend. Columbus Day is a horrible holiday for many historical reasons in my view, but that aside, I was there in a Friday. Columbus Day was on the following Monday. Why would they gouge customers for $47 three days before a random holiday? . . Anyway, that wasn't a good start to the experience. But I want to review this place irrespective of those shenanigans and provide an unbiased assessment.. . The food was decent and diverse. They had a couple meat stations - one which was serving prime rib and corned beef, and another which was serving goat shanks and lamb chops. The corned beef was really flavorable as was the lamb shanks. Those who tried the other options had a similar assessment.. . They had a few seafood stations, one which had shrimp cocktails, another with several different types of crab legs, and a sushi station. The crab legs were sliced in half vertically, making it easy to eat. The shrimp was okay. The sushi was underwhelming (especially the sashimi). . . They had a pizza station which was pretty good. They had a few different kinds of thin-crust pizza, and I appreciated that.. . Everything else, for the most part, was pretty "meh" for a buffet - nothing better than you'd have in your average buffet in other parts of the country. . . The one thing I will offer specific praise for is the dessert section. They had several different options - cheesecakes, brownies, flan, cookies, creme brulee, ice cream, etc. After trying a bite of a few different options, I can say that they were all good except for the flan.. . Ultimately, when factoring in even the regular, non-holiday rate, I'd say that it isn't worth the price when there are several better dining options nearby. It's definitely not worth $47. Ridiculous.
Okay, this is my second time at the Buffet. The first time I was really impressed, the food was delicious and there was such a big variety. And the dessert buffet! The best. . So i decided to come back 3 weeks later with my family. It was a Wednesday night, there wasn't a big line and not top busy. . The food was again delicious, but the service was the worst. We were 3 adults and a kid and had ordered drinks for 3 adults, but it seemed like after 2 drinks it was a problem giving them to us. Our waitress seemed more and more angry and did not smile or talk back when we asked her to bring drinks. After 1.45 hours she said that we couldn't get more drinks and had to go. WHAT. Okay, on the receipt it says that they would like if people would stay no longer than 2 hours, but we just asked for a last drink. Well, she came back and said you can get a last one. And then in one of the drinks there were bugs in the ice cubes. BUGS. So gross. We talked to the manager and she apologized and we got the money back for 1 unlimited drinks (around $13). . . I am never coming back, good food, but that can never make up for the bad bad service, and BUGS in the ice cubes. EWW
Last time I dinned here was a few years ago and the quality is really good, so this time I decided to give it another try. . Came for a Thu dinner at 7pm, the wait was not bad about 15 minutes. The quality of the food is just not the same. I am kind of disappointed by the selection. . I will only come back to eat if the wait is shorter than 30 minutes, anything longer than that isnot worth it.
A bit too steep for a limited selection. We went on a Thursday night, given this isn't a crowded night we still expected a bit more. The selection was not very big at all, the quality was all great but I was still a bit disappointed. . . Pros:. . Amazing desserts (the biggest variety in the buffet was with the desserts), friendly staff. . Cons:. . Expensive, limited selection.
Tentata dai famosi buffet degli hotel di Las Vegas, ho deciso di provare uno dei piu lussuosi. E in effetti le proposte erano tante e alcune anche molto particolari: sushi, manzo kobe, chilli, gamberi, prosciutto glassato, granchio e dolci a volonta. Il problema e che molte di queste specialita sembravano avere tutte lo stesso sapore (poco), tanto che una delle cose che ho piu apprezzato e stata la pizza. Per 37 dollari a persona (bevande escluse) mi aspettavo un po' piu di qualita e non solo di quantita. Molto buoni i dolci.
We went to the Bellagio for brunch at around 10:30am and were really surprised that there wasn't much of a line. We got through it quickly and were seated right away. The highlights of the buffet were definitely the breakfast items. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were so good that after trying a few other items, I went back for seconds! The waitress did a good job making sure our drinks were refilled promptly and the ambiance was nice. For the price and the fact that it was brunch, it was a lot of money, but I guess it's expected at the Bellagio.
So much food! Unlimited Kobe beef, shrimps, dessert.... We ate so much we were not able to get up and walk out.  It's more expensive then most buffets and the line is usually very long,luckily we are vip so didn't have to wait in the same line as most people but it's worth the wait.  Delicious!!
I like to come here on a friday right before dinner time so i can save money by paying for lunch price but get dinner entrees half an hour or so later. King crab is the star of the show here. Their snow crab is icy cold and split in half which i dont like. I absolutely love beef wellington but their recipe only gets two to three stars. Beef wellington is not that hard to make at a five star level. I can't believe they can't figure out how to make it better. This is the Bellagio, isn't it? Prime rib and kobe steak also need help.. . All that said, i still come because the king crab and a few other items make it worth it to me.  But i hope the chefs read this and at the very least enhance their beef wellington recipe. Perhaps more mushroom pate duxelle and a Madeira gravy.
the cashier is a douchebag here. . a child costs the same as an adult. . place is hyped, alot of the stuff seemed fancy but was just...false for some reason. . not so great. . wynn is better, so much better
The Buffet at the Bellagio is fabulous. This past weekend we ate lunch at the buffet twice and were overwhelmed with both our choices of food and the excellence of its preparation.. . For years, I had my own cafe and bakery and I love good food ,and I can honestly say this was a total treat - at a wonderfully reasonable price.. The seafood was abundant - both cooked and raw. A wonderful sushi bar. An entire area devoted to wonderful european style thin crust pizzas - seven or eight kinds, and other Italian delicacies. There was a station of delicious innovative salads and an area of warm meats - loin of pork done on a rotisserie in the background, prime rib slices, chicken wellington and on and on.. . The selections were terrific either for vegetarian or meat eaters. A relaxed environment with no rushing and adequate table service for drinks by very friendly waitstaff. Definitely a bargain in the Bellagio , as one sandwich hovers individually around ten dollars in the other cafes. Everything was delicious.
Great choices and many. Mountains of crab and shrimp, kobe beef, salads and sides. Desserts all tasted the same though. Skip it and go to jean louis.
Quality of food has gone down.  We went for dinner and were disappointed.  We have been here before so we looked forward to returning.  We will be going to Wynn instead.
Brunch selection is amazing- you have a good variety of foods.  While the food quality and selection was great, our service purely sucked!  I asked for a cup of coffee and received it 20 minutes later.  My other drink refills (non-alcoholic at that!) were also slow to come around.
I don't understand the hype of this buffet. Personally I find it overpriced. For example the lunch buffet is only $22 and served from 11am-4pm. They other basic selections of pasta, meats, salads, and 1 sushi option, which is a California roll. Now dinner is 4-9/10 and is doubled the price per say, and includes all of the same items BESIDES an addition to cold crab legs and shrimp. I personally like crab legs hot, so I didn't enjoy. We ironically got there at 3:30pm, obtained lunch price and then experienced dinner for no extra charge. When I saw the dinner selection I was shocked that they would charge people almost doubled for the same thing. I suggest you do what we did to save money and go end of lunch. Good luck
We went for dinner twice on two different trip to Vegas, and so far we think that this is the best buffet in Vegas by far! There is a lot of variety, and everything tastes quite good to excellent. I love the king crab legs! We will certainly go back.
First off, the front end staff is absolutely terrible; miscommunication amuck and heckling us about how many people were in our party. Children are charged the same as adults $37 - serious? Did I just walk into Big Wong's Chinese Restaurant? . . For comparison, I also went to Wicked Spoon of the Cosmopolitan. Bellagio definitely has a wider selection, but loses in the uniqueness category. . . The pros:. -Good sushi selection/quality. I murdered a whole school of fish during my consumption of salmon sushi. . -Decent seafood variety. -Numerous red meats available. -1 point for the abysmal kobe beef. How embarrassing. . -Delicious creme brulee. Inhaled at least 5 of these. . . The cons:. -Front end staff. . -Limited "speciality" items and ethnic food. . -Besides the creme brulee, desserts were mediocre. . . The Buffet at Bellagio doesn't disappoint, but it misses that "specialness" one comes to expect from a Vegas buffet. For strictly taste purposes, I'd give the nod to Bellagio. For the overall experience though, Wicked Spoon wins there.
The Bellagio is probably one of the most famous locations on the Las Vegas strip. Whether it is renowned for the amazing dancing fountains or the glamour from Danny & the boys from the Oceans 11 trilogy, the Bellagio is a must visit when travelling to sin city. . However, if your hunger takes over in between poker hands, may I suggest a trip down the road??? The fact that it was the buffet at the Bellagio enticed us to line up to get in. After a bit of a wait (about 15minutes) we were in. The food was pretty sub-standard from the meat, to the sides & even desserts. Applebee's even looked good over this place. . Then came the service. These waitresses  obviously get paid fairly well as they sure ain't pushing for tips. . Please don't let the name of Bellagio entice you to enter the buffet doors, but if you must go, don't expect too much.
After coming here I would hesitate to pay full price for their breakfast/lunch buffet!! But with a free comp or free myvegas voucher. I am in! When it comes to the Bellagio name usually everything is amazing. This buffet however lacks that amazement. Its just ok.  The carving station provided several choices. I enjoyed the turkey the best. The chicken was so dry I could not eat it. The bbq beef...save yourself and avoid! The breakfast items were standard fare, but of course the deserts do shine at the Bellagio. The pizza station is pretty cool, but personally I dont want pizza at a buffet! I must get my moneys worth(or the free voucher moneys worth).The salad bar was very plentiful on options and good. The smoked salmon I had was really not good. My pieces tasted off with a horrible flavor. My drinks were filled quickly and plates removed faster than the speed of lightening. Overall ok. Just not spectacular!
