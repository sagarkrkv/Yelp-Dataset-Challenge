It was alright... we didn't get a reserved table our promoter promised we didnt need one. He was wrong. Little pathways to walk around and small dance floor. More of a hyped up lounge with a dance floor. We had fun dont get me wrong but by about midnight we left to hit another club because it was just... an odd mix of people. Music was good so the DJ knew what he was doing :)
I like this club although kind of small you can't go wrong with Wynn/ Encore clubs.They have good bottle prices and usually play hip hop.  The outside patio/ waterfall make for a cool unique ambiance.  Bartenders are very nice.
I went here Saturday, 10/4/14.  This place is dead.  Nobody was there and they still charged $30 cover.  This is the spot if you want a big empty place bumping music all to yourself.  Go elsewhere if you are looking to party.  Guy to Girl ratio is 10:1.  It's like a mini XS inside.  The best thing about this place is the short line outside.
Fun club, go early, got on guest list and was let right in... Staff was friendly and the door people were nice too.. will be going again~ :)
Been here once and never went back..long line..expensive drinks..expensive bottle service..everything is expensive. That was it! :(
: Long line, ticket to get in is only $20..pricey drinks, rave not a big fun, walked in and had a couple of drinks walked out of the club disappointed :(
