Ok so I been here for dinner before and I love the jarred foie gras ...I love the frites. I stay at the Venetian many time and I never had the breakfast so I had it on morning with my daughter. I love the waffles here and it was perfect(Crispy and fluffy). My daughter loved the salmon and bagles.. I will come here from now on for my breakfast.
I have been here a handful of times and will definitely go back. The food is great and the service is fast.
Amazing service, delicious food (the quiche and bacon were fantastic), and tasty bellinis. We sat outside and ate with a lovely view in perfect weather. I had a great brunch experience!
Baby, it's not you. It's me.. . Have you ever had a ho-hum experience at a place and thought afterwards, I just made the wrong choices? I strongly feel that the mediocre dining experience I had at Bouchon fell into this.. . I am a Thomas Keller devotee. I watch him cook on Youtube, I buy his cookbooks, I'd like to shake his hand. I was excited for my 1st dine in at one of his restaurant group.. . I'm a dinner type of chap and made a reservation for such, despite a majority of Yelpers reviewing the brunch offerings.. . Debut: . An amazing wheat bread twist with imported butter came compliments of the house. I ordered the Terrine de Fois Gras de Canard to start. Chilled Fois Gras Pate served in a mason jar, with toasted baguette and coarse salt. Never had Fois in this fashion and I must admit it was a smidgeon too intense.  Not to be discouraged, I selected the Fois Gras Saute and it was very good. Pan Seared Fois in a savory brown gravy.. . Plats Principaux:. For supper, the Truite Poele. Sauteed rainbow trout, on a bed of greens and sunflower seed, in a brown butter sauce.. A very average flavored offering.. . Le Dessert:. Chocolate Mousse Ice Cream, vanilla creme anglaise, short bread dusting. Uninspired.. . I still have hope and will be heading to the Beverly Hills locale this week for lunch and part deux. I want to see Bouchon shine.. . Thanks for reading :0)
The food was incredible. There are inside and outside seating options available. There is no reservations (first come first serve) but the wait was less than 5 minutes. The menu is excellent. The place is rated as $$$ but my wife and I ate an incredible meal for under 50 dollars. The corn beef hash is out of this world good. Probably the best i tasted so far. My wife ordered bread pudding which didn't disappoint either. The bacon was a separate charge of 5 dollars, but it was cooked to perfection. Most defiantly a place I would eat again.
Great dining experience. Went with 2 other people. We ordered the mussels - big portion for $26. We also got the foie grass - delicious and the roasted bone marrow that was to die for! Great portion for the buck.
Without a doubt, the best meal I've had in Vegas, ever. I live there and consider myself a "foody". I don't want to make any comparisons that take away from many other renowned Vegas restaurants, but the foie gras, seafood tower with lobster, the skate, and the bone marrow were to die for! The desserts that followed were absolutely incredible as well! I can't give a higher recommendation than this: Go before you die!
Cute restaurant in the Venetian, it took us awhile to find it though! I personally wasn't impressed with the food, it was basic breakfast food, nothing special.
We went to Bouchon in September during CTIA. I got there 20 min early which was enough time to enjoy a drink at the bar. Best Sazerac I ever had in my life! Strongly recommend it for the strong drinkers out there. Flavors of bitters touching your lips with the hint of whiskey taking control. Amazing! . . As soon as the marketing team go there we started with entrees. No foreplay, straight to the point and because we were all starving and tired from working all day. I had the steak fries. They were average. A co-worker had the *Croque Madame. Two words: comfort food! Another college had the Boudin Blanc. Two words: weirdly tasty. . . The waiter was very stern and had a snarky attitude. Since it was a French restaurant we had an inside joke on how French this guy's attitude got as the night went on. By the time we got to dessert he was kind of insulted nobody wanted dessert but not to fear readers as I was there to save the night and ordered a 5 layered chocolate cake with gold flakes on top. It was quite tasty or as the French would say  . C'est delicieux! . . Overall it was a good experience. The decor was very nice and the prices decent for Vegas standards. . . Conclusion: If you're staying at the Venetian and feel a bit tired to walk out of the casino I strongly recommend this place. Oh and I hear Brunch is really good here.
Service was just ok. Food wasn't exactly horrible but I was expecting something so much more. The pastries were good. Oh and the coffee! I still dream of the coffee... We will meet again Coffee! I gave this place 5 stars only for the coffee. Kinda wishedI would of just ordered only coffee!
Bouchon felt commercialized and outdated to me. . . I walked up to the hostess stand, was not greeted, and all three hostesses looked at me like they were wondering why I was there. Well I was there to get a table for two for breakfast in an very empty restaurant. . . We were offered the inside of the restaurant which felt cold and dark, or the outside patio which was falling apart. You can tell the restaurant has not cared for the patio in quite some time.. . We decided on the croissant, curried chicken lunch special with fries, and les oeufs. I could not believe the croissant I was given. It tasted stale by the hard interior and the non flakey exterior. My open faced curried chicken sandwich was hard to eat, the curry flavor did not shine through, and the overall flavor of the salad did not come together. The les oeufs plate was also poorly done. Potato croquettes were so salty, the brioche toast was dry, however, the eggs were cooked well.. . Bouchon is a large scale restaurant in terms of the unpersonalized service and the size of the space. Because of these factors it almost feels gimmicky to me that they have a Bouchon in a Las Vegas hotel.
I have been before and it was average I decided to try it again. I had no such luck the front desk reception at the restaurant stated we could eat from 2-5 but only the bar menu. I was ok with that however once I planned my day around it and showed up they would not let me sit at a table. The bar was full all table empty and they would no sit my party. The manager would not honor the front desk offer and I left. Not the best way to do business.
Reputed to be one of Vegas' best restaurants. I'll bet you hear that about almost every restaurant in Vegas. . We had meat and lots of it in a few different cuts. The quality was first rate and so too was the service. The wine list was excellent with a very diverse offering. I ate so much meat that I couldn't help but feel a little like Conan the barbarian for the next three days. . If I had to have one gripe it would be that the background music was set far too high... an elegant and traditional place with metal cranked up to 9 on the dial just took away from the experience.
How does anyone give this place less than 5 stars? The service is speedy, the food is amazing, and the ambiance is beautiful with indoor and outdoor seating. This place is located in the The beautiful Venetian hotel. Its honestly not even that pricey for Vegas. Our French toast which was delish was only $12 to give you an idea. I recommend to get the assorted pastries and make sure you order the binets (jelly filled donut holes). My husband went back to the bakery twice in one weekend just for these guys. Also the coffee is strong but delicious. Overall a lovely experience. Will definitely go back on our return to Vegas.
Came here for a team dinner. Server was very attentive and friendly.. . We were served freshbread to start and toasted pistachios - on the house. I never loved pistachios so much in my life - they tasted amazing warmed up! It was so addictive I couldn't help but go back for more. From now on, I'm toasting all my pistachios!. . For the main, I got the steak frites but substituted the frites for fried gnocchi. Steak was super tender and delicious but I wasn't a fan of the fried gnocchi.. It tasted like soft fried dough. . . I got the pear tart for dessert which I didn't enjoy that much either - the tart wasn't very flaky and the dessert tasted a bit dry. The sorbet tasted amazing though!. . Overall it's a great place but I would definitely come here for a special occasion.
Of all the reservations we had for our 4 days in Las Vegas, Bouchon was the one I was the most excited about. My husband and I had reservations at the Bouchon in Beverly Hills a couple of times but had to cancel for various reason so we never made it in.. . Perhaps it was the particular night we were there or perhaps it was because we went to the Vegas location first instead of the Napa Valley or Beverly Hills locations.... but we were less than impressed. The menu wasnt anything too creative or unique. The food was good, but just okay. . We had escargot for an appetizer, but it didnt come close to as good as the escargot we had the night before at Hugo's Cellar. I had the croque madam as my main course, and it was okay... but just okay. The brioche was overly salty and not at all what I was expecting. Honestly, the best thing on my plate were the french fries! They ended up comping our table 2 desserts due to my husband's mom having to send her food back. . . For a place that is known for their pastries; I had high hopes for the desserts and was really excited to see the ones the manager sent out to us. Unfortunately; they wernt good. At all. The strawberry rhubarb crumble bar was just... not right. And it was very obvious that the chocolate espresso cake had been frozen and then defrosted. Which, to me, was a huge disappointment. Im not one to turn down sweets, but after a bite of each dessert I didnt even go back for more. . . It pains me to say this, but I do not recommend Bouchon in Las Vegas. Perhaps I will give the locations in Beverly Hills and/or Napa a chance, but this location left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).
This is one of the restaurants my husband really wanted to visit while on our Vegas vacation last week.  We were just going to grab some pastries to go so we could munch on them at our leisure; however, we decided to go full-on breakfast at the last minute.. . First of all, the restaurant itself is just lovely.  Elegant, blue decor puts you at ease as soon as you walk in.  There is also a very nice outdoor seating area if you are so inclined.  Service was great.  Our server was very expeditious in taking our order, bringing our food, and checking on us throughout the meal.. . The first thing we did was sample one of their pastries on special, which was a chocolate almond croissant.  This was absolutely amazing.  The perfect way to start out breakfast.  They also have a special deal where you can get 4 pastries for $13, which sounds extremely cheap compared to most of Las Vegas.  We had them box some up to-go for us, which made us anticipating the next morning's breakfast in a hard-core, can't wait, stomach growling sort of way.. . I chose the Brioche Doree for my main meal.  This was a delicious French toast served bread pudding style, layered with custard, caramelized apples and bananas, drizzled in maple syrup.  It was so delicious.  Comforting, moist, soft, oozy - all your favorite food adjectives rolled into one.  I ate all of it, and I never ever ever eat all my food.. . My husband ordered the Petit Dejeuner Americaine which was two eggs any style with bacon, sausage, pastry, brioche toast, juice and a Bouchon blend coffee.  Out of all that, he was mostly in awe of the toast.  He took a bite, then sat back and kind of zoned out for a bit.  Said it was amazing, which is kind of an odd thing to say about toast.  But I suppose it is brioche that is made at Bouchon, so it probably IS amazing.. . We split a side of Lyonnaise potatoes, and I highly highly highly two thumbs up suggest you order these with your meal.  Ugh.  So good.  In fact, I could've used a whole plate of these.  Like a huge, ginormous plate.  In order words, don't split this side.  It is definitely a single serving and you'll want them all for yourself.. . Wish we were locals so we could go back and try lunch or dinner.  Cuz if breakfast is any indication of what they're capable of, I have no doubt we could eat here all day every day and never feel it necessary to leave.
Yes. Bouchon is a 4 star in my book. I've been here multiple times, including this morning for brunch. We had a 500ml of wine, which was perfect for me and my mom to split. I lovvvveee their salmon lox, as well as the salmon terrine that I've had several times. . . Service is always very good, not incredibly engaging, but on point and never leaving me wanting.
My wife and I had finished watching O and were trying to decide where to dine. Le Cirque and Picasso had ample availability but, ugh, whowants to sit imprisoned there for hours? Instead, we decided on Bouchon - meaning the next challenge was getting there on foot. A helpful valet at the Bellagio said it was a 15 minute walk - which was really wrong. From the Bellagio, the Venetian looks very close - I mean, it's right there; there's the sign. It's right there!  No. It's not. . . It feels a little like walking through enemy territory getting there. At one point, we were in front of a small group of drunk young men, one of whom said he wanted to crush his beer bottle over someone's head. Vegas baby!. . I thought that once we got to the Venetian, we'd be there - but even then no! That place is big. . . We arrived at 9:50 but were graciously seated at a lovely table outside. Not quite as bucolic as the Yountville location, but still quite pleasant. . . The food, as in the Napa Valley flagship, is awesome and simple. It's impressive to see TK's high standards are met so capably by the staff here. . . The frisee salad with soft poached egg and lardons is excellent and the poulet rotis was perfectly done. . . Great location, great ambience, great food. The perfect bistro!. . As for the Belgians at the next table eating pommes frites with mayonnaise - c'mon man, just gross.
Napa location is on a different level compared to Vegas. The food and service at the bar were both a little rough. Our server/bartender completely forgot about us several times and we had to reorder a few times as well. In addition, I overheard the bartender blame the chef for an error in food to a customer. I thought that was very unprofessional. Quality of the food did not seem up to par from my previous experiences in Napa.
I came back here for dinner with my wife. And honestly this was a much much better experience this time around. . I had the half lobster, followed by the foie gras terrine, and grilled lamb loin. . My wife had the tomato soup and the roasted chicken. We then shared the Lemmon tart for desert. . Everything was very good, especially service. Our waiter - Ross Was his name I think, was awesome.
Went for breakfast after combing reviews...I contemplated 3 stars but I can't do it. The madame croque was very good (unfortunately I didn't order it), but the best part of my meal was the coffee.. . I had the omelette of the day with chicken, cherry tomatoes, and cheese. Those ingredients were in it but they were not plentiful and I think they forgot the seasonings. . . I also had the Salade Frisee with a poached egg. I had two similar salads on my recent trip to Milwaukee and they both blew this one out of the water. Again, where's the flavor? Even the bacon didn't give me the salty kick I was looking for.. . The bread was even very mediocre.. . The coffee, madame croque, and patio atmosphere kept me in a decent mood but I would never recommend it for the food.
It was my sisters bachelorette weekend event and a group of 10 ladies dressed in fancy sparkle attire should done somewhere nice!. . We were started off with complimentary pistachios and bread and amazon butter.  Our server felt like a robot but later on warmed up towards the end of the night.. . Here's what I had:. MOULES AUX POIREAUX $28.50Maine bouchot musselssteamed with white wine, Dijon mustard, while garlic, served with French fries. . I REALLY wish we did family-style dining because my meal was HUGE. I must have gotten 20 mussels in my dish with a huge batch of French fries that looked like an appetizer size for the whole table! The mussels had whole garlic cloves in them which was amazing! The way everything was laid out, you had a side of the ceramic pot to dip your tender mussels in it's own savory and flavorful juice.  The French fries were lovely; thin, crisp, and pretty much your standard yummy fries.  For another $11 I could have upgraded them to black truffle but it's okay :)  Unfortunately I didn't get to finish my dish, and because I was in Vegas, it's not like I can take the leftovers to-go :(. . I enjoyed my time here and the food was amazing. I'd love to come here and try the brunch though.
I was excited to finally make it to a Thomas Keller property, having reach much about The French Laundry and Per Se.  We made it there for Sunday Brunch, which other reviewers has commented was terrific.  Unfortunately the experience did not live up to the reputation, and I'm wondering if the trend of super Chefs opening outposts in Las Vegas isn't fraught with peril.  Perhaps the local talent base doesn't support the aspiration and instead leaves us with a watered down version of greatness.  Sort of a parable for Vegas itself?. . The restaurant itself is lovely, and we snagged a nice table outside on the patio, which was a beautiful, calm oasis.  Unfortunately things kinds of came off the rails shortly after this as a series of service and cooking gaffes made me wonder if the staff was perhaps a bit hung over from the previous night's escapades?. . We ordered Oysters to start, then Croque Madame and Quiche for mains.  Approximately 30 minutes after placing our order the mains arrived.  As the Oysters has not yet arrived, we sent them back and asked for the Oysters.  The runner who brought the food did a good job of realizing the error, taking the food away without argument and sending over the manager. The manager also did a good job of being appropriately upset by the miscue, promising it was not up to their standard, and comped the offending oysters (which turned out to be quite good when they finally arrived).. . Hopefully smooth sailing from this point forward.  No such luck.  The Croque and Quiche arrived.  The Croque was absolutely delicious and perfect.  The Brioche toast that underlay it was a triumph.  However the Quiche was luke warm, not hot.  At this point we'd waited long enough and were starving so the issue was registered with the manager but the quiche (which was otherwise delicious) was eaten.  . . Finally, in an attempt to redeem the challenging meal we ordered the Beignets.  They too arrived cold (not even warm) and were uninspiring.  An unfortunate end to an error prone meal.. . Since most of the other reviews raved about the service I can only assume that our experience was an anomaly, but I have nothing else to gauge Bouchon with.  I'll give Bouchon another try on my next visit to Vegas, but in the meantime this was not the experience I expected, or to which I believe Bouchon aspires.  Hopefully the poor beleaguered manager, who did his best to address a bad situation, succeeds in rectifying the issues.
So had high hopes as I brought colleague's here for breakfast. We were sat in a very nice dining room and the staff was friendly as well as attentive. When the food arrived a little to quickly as if it was cooked some time in advance we realized it indeed was. Eggs...cold, bacon.....cold, chocolate almond croissant bland and the opposite of flaky definitely not made fresh.Not what I expected of Bouchon. Very disappointed in there deliverable.
Bouchon is a solid dinner place.  If you're going for something that's not super fancy, but still good eats, then I highly recommend this place.. . The bread.  They serve you a nice loaf of freshly baked bread with salted butter.  I could eat two loaves of this stuff.  There's nothing special about this bread other than the fact that it's done extremely well.. . I've been here three times and so far I've had the steak frites and the mussels with white wine and butter (twice).  Both are awesome dishes, but as you can probably tell, I'm partial to the mussels.  The mussels are done with a white wine, garlic and butter steaming liquid that is amazing when you dip the freshly baked bread in it.  I think there's also some thing slices of andouille sausage in the broth for flavor.. . I don't recall my experience with the steak frites, but I'm sure it was good.. . This place is great because it's ambiance is without pretense so you can relax, but fancy enough to go to for a special event like a birthday or anniversary. . . I recommend making reservations.
My second visit here.  In the Venetian hotel but you do not need to walk through the casino.  . Probably three times the size of my familiar yountville location.. During the day more focused on breakfast in the omission of French onion soup is troubling.
Worst Lamb Steak ever, service was just ok.. Even the sides for the lamb steak was very bad.
We have been here before and looked forward to returning.  What a disappointment!  The steaks were tough.  We ordered a seafood tower and the presentation was sloppy.  The shrimp were just thrown on top of the other shellfish.  The frites were not as good as they used to be.  The service was not up to par.  Thomas Keller should be ashamed of how his restaurant has gone down hill.
Good over all was good. You get a lot for the money. The pastries are a must. We sat out side which was nice. Place closes breakfast by 1 so make sure you don't wake up too late after a night of drinking to enjoy.
this review is from a past dining in February 2014, better late then never.... . first and foremost! great decor, location and atmosphere, It being a Thomas Keller signature restaurant at The Venetian Hotel and Casino i had full expectations, however its not what i got! and for those reasons i can rate this only 2 star based on my personal experience.   The night my Sister and I had decided to have dinner at this location, we got seated right away near the Seafood bar, 5 minutes later a couple was seated next to us. at this point we still had not received any complimentary bread & butter like most restaurants would do at the time your seated. . . our neighbors had received their's first in addition they were already ordering their appetizers, by this time we were barely getting our bread and drinks were being ordered. easy to notice that our service was becoming very slow and delayed on our table.  "ill remind you we were seated first, and this couple was seated 5 minutes later, after our arrival"  at this stage they are having their drinks and first order of appetizers were being served to our neighbors, Yet we were still waiting on our appetizers. . . minutes after our neighbors are having their entree's where we are still working on our first course. 15 minutes had past our neighbors are getting ready to pay their bill and go on with their night. YET, we still have not received our entree's waiter did come out and say what was happenings, 20 minutes later, i decided to call the manager on duty and explain what was going on, that our service from the time of arrival had not being going well, our neighbors who were seat next to us arrived 5 minutes later, and had already left..  at this stage i was very upset and very unhappy, that a 2 course dinner took nearly 2 hours! WTF. . the food was good, but nothing extraordinary or worth the wait, meh, at this stage the manager decided to go and speak with the back of the house and all sudden 2 minutes later our waiter comes out being very applogetic about the service, and offered us complimentary desserts on the house. which my sister and I opted out! which just wanted to leave!!!!!!!!!!!. . The overall experience at Bouchon was horrible service far the worst that i have received at any fine dining restaurant! there was no compassion on the staff of the serviced received, therefore for those reasons i would never come here again or recommend this to anyone. the food was not the greatest to my taste!
For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. . As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.. The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.. Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.. In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.. Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.
Highly overrated. We were here for brunch after seeing so good reviews on the web. It was a complete disappointment. The sequence in which we were served was completely off. We were served croissant first and the butter/jam came 15 mins after. The hot milk was served and they forgot my coffee. By the time coffee came in my milk is cold. The brunch itself was mediocre at best. Nothing special and to be wowed.
We went to Bouchon at the Venetian for brunch and it was quite good. I ordered the mussels and the dish was very rich in flavor and the size was generous. The ambience, service and location were great. We will certainly go back for brunch when we are in Vegas.
Bouchon. . Decadent, heavy, unapologetic about that. French.. . Not a big fan of the paper table cloth though that makes it easy for them to serve bread without a plate right on the paper. I guess that's rustic, old world charm?. . The service was 4 1/2 stars. Waiter was very nice and sommelier very helpful.. . i had the Confit de Canard: crispy duck leg confit with Lyonnaise potatoes & whole grain mustard sauce. good  4 out of 5 stars.. . Braised beef short rib special. 3.75 stars out of 5.. . Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard served with toasted baguette 4 stars out of 5. . To be honest, French isn't my go-to but I was with some friends who love this place. I wasn't blown over because the food while being good is not a meal I will remember. But I think that's my personal taste.
Food was delicious, but service was terrible. We arrived for Sunday brunch and were told it would be a 35 minute wait for a table, but we could sit at a high top in the bar right away. We were hungry so we took the high top. Our table overlooked two regular tables for 2 in the restaurant that remained empty literally the entire time we were there. We asked if we could move to one of them, but were told no. So, we just watched empty tables for over one hour. Waiters were totally scattered and overwhelmed in the uncrowded restaurant. I had to get up and get menus because we were not given any, and it took a long time to order, get the check, and pay. We were brought wrong items, and had to ask for coffee and water refills every time. Brunch took nearly two hours with the slow service. I've had dinner here before and it's been amazing, but the service has just gone downhill. I will not be returning.
It was ok...I've had a zillion times better!  I wasn't impressed enough to crave it or think about going back...the Service however was impeccable and to me even though I'm a foodie if the service is great I'm usually a very happy camper!
Amazing french little restaurant in the middle of the Venetian. Sit outside if you can! Oysters were delicious as was the chicken dish --and the mussels. Definitely a great quaint spot if you are looking for good food and a great low key atmosphere.
Not impressed. My wife's mussels were less than fresh to say the least and when we brought the issue to the waiter's attention he didn't even apologized for the situation. I had the trout and it was greasy and bland. The service was slow and the waiter didn't really care much.. . Overall a subpar experience.
