I went here about a month ago with a really big group of people and they were more than accommodating. Our waiter (and I really wish I could remember his name) was so enthusiastic and funny. The atmosphere was pretty hip and modern.. . I ordered the Douxelle Burger with their house wine and had their salt and pepper fries. The burger was huge and had so much flavor. Double the points for having lettuce wrap options for the burgers since I have celiac disease and can't have the bun. The fries were perfect. The perfect combination of crunch and salt and pepper. Their house wine was amazing. My date, who's not a big fan of wine, was actually impressed on how delicious it was.. . The only negative things I could possibly say is that it took a while for us to get our drinks. However, we were a large group on a Saturday night. Overall, FEZ is a great culinary experience that I will definitely go back and experience again.
Love the food and the service.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a unique, healthy and flavorful alternative.
Yes I am a FAN!. . I'm in town for a day of two on business and i found this close to our hotel.. . I read a couple reviews and it said this place was a dive bar. but this is no where near a dive bar. . . First of all it has a great full bar, with a huge martini list and drink specials. The bartenders are friendly as ever. . . I took a couple pictures of the appetizer that turned into a meal!. . Its the Lamb Sliders, $12.50 (appetizer) Kinda pricey, but since they turned into the meal, I was glad to pay that. . . I also wanted something else to go light, so I had a FEZ salad which was $6.50. Perfect size! and tasted just like I wanted it to, not too heavy and not to light. . . If you are around the area this is a great place for lunch or dinner. have a couple drinks too they aren't bad. . . - Sean
Delicious food and fun atmosphere.
Can't remember what kind of burger I had here but I remember it being amazing. Drinks and desert were really good to. They have specials late night which is always a bonus.
Came here with a good friend for lunch. She had a burger and a beer, I had the salmon with roasted veggies. The atmosphere is always amazing. This was her first time. It was a little hard for her to find, but other than that she had a good experience. The am always impressed with the food and the restrooms are always clean. $50 with tip, kinda steep for lunch, but we both had alcohol with our food. Then again, I haven't seen her in a year, so it was worth it. I will continue to come here and introduce new people to it. One of my favorite spots!
Find out what the "monthly special" is and order that. I think it's $8, and you'll get something wonderful. I've had an heirloom BLT salad; braised pork shoulder with wild mushroom risotto; chicken parm that tasted just like Grandmas. I would give this place 5 stars, but they really need a menu update. Too many burgers- but the burgers are great. Mondays are "Margarita Mondays" and the apricot is truly unique and makes me want to be a full time alcoholic.
Awesome restaurant!
Love this place.    Great burgers.   Swanky vibe
Oh my gosh, the BEST hummus EVER. So garlicky and delicious; it's essentially an orgasm for your taste buds!!  Exceptional cocktails, too, and the rest of the food is outstanding. Everything is very fresh, creative, and delicious. Atmosphere is hip, modern, and friendly. Always fantastic service. It is a must-visit place whether or not you go for food, or just drinks, or BOTH!
I want to like this place but the service has always held me back. To be fair, the food has always been very good. I like the menu and the variety. But for some reason, I have yet to have anything better than almost average service. There is a lot room for improvement when it comes to accurate, friendly, and prompt service.
On every visit, i walk away saying that was the best I've ever had!   You can't go wrong no matter what you select from their menu!   I'm particularly partial to the Arroz con Pollo though & it's only $6 every Monday...a must try!
I've been going to this place for several years now. The food is GREAT! Try the HUMMUS. The spicy hummus is amazing. The kisras are great as well. I always get the apricot margarita. The atmosphere is great. I love the bar and the lounge area. It's a great spot to hang out. Their patio is nice as well. You will not be disappointed if you go here. It's one of the best spots in phoenix! The only downside to this place is the service sometimes. I've had a few occasions where the wait time was excessive. I worked as a waitress for four years, so I understand the job. There is no excuse for drinks to take 15 minutes to come to your table. I also went here for my birthday this year and was very disappointed with the service as well. The waiter told us that the gratuity wasn't included in the bill, and it was. Even though I told him of his mistake, when I noticed it, I still gave him an extra tip. Some people might have been offended by that however. Whenever I go here, I make sure I have the extra time just in case we get some bad service. Even though I have had a couple negative experiences, I still go back because of the wonderful atmosphere and food. As long as you are with good company, this is a wonderful place. The music and decor are fantastic, as well.
What a nice little surprise in the downtown Phoenix area. I came with a group of 6 of us during the last day of our training phase. The atmosphere was fairly charming but the food is why I will return.. . I ordered the rosemary chicken sandwich and our group ordered each of the four types of fries, and I was able to sample them all. The sandwich was excellent, much better than anticipated. My favorite fries were the cinnamon brushed sweet potato fries. The service... well, to be honest, I was too wrapped up in the food to notice but obviously it wasn't lacking enough for me to complain.. . Highly recommend!
What's not to love about this place? The food is amazing the staff is supper friendly and the atmosphere is perfect . I started off just going here for dinner and drinks . But last week I tried their brunch and oh my it was the best brunch I have ate. If you haven't ate here it's highly recommended
FEZ is a restaurant that has great food. I've been to FEZ a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed my food there. One of my favorites on the menu is the arroz con pollo and the lamb curry. The arroz con polo has the right amount of spice and is delicious. Another good thing about FEZ is their cocktails; most of them are vodka based, have quirky names, and are reasonably priced. The restaurant has a very modern look and is not very big.. . Another must try at FEZ are the lamb sliders. These sliders are juicy, tender and downright delicious when ingested with the accompanying mint sauce and pita bread. Ultimately, FEZ is restaurant that serves great food and good drinks.
This is my favorite restaurant for casual dining. Great prices on food. I come here at least once a week or  more because since I started coming there hasn't been a day I don't crave their FEZ salad with chicken or FEZ burger with Harissa fries and aioli sauce. I have brought everyone I know here and they all have become addicted to their food. The staff is amazing and the service is great. FEZ  is a must for brunch, lunch and dinner.
