We always have dinner here before any event at the mgm, reason is its convenient the service is quick especially if you short of time. We got right in without a reservation and we were a party of 8.. . We ordered the tuna tartare , loved it presentation and taste was yummy.  The steak skewers were my favorite, was not over cooked  so we got 2 orders. The chonise chicken salad a must. Our drinks berry mojito just perfect.. It was noisy but that was because it's super bowl weekend and  Pink in concert. . Our waiter was very attentive
This is hands down the best late night place to eat at MGM. We eat here at least twice every time because they have quality food, there's never a wait, and they're open til 6am every night! Even the fast food restaurants in the food court (which are usually the only food options late at night in hotels) close sooner. If you play the game myVEGAS on facebook you can redeem your points for a BOGO entree offer.
Got to try this place for Apps one night, after our conference. I got the last bowl of clam chowder available..it was disappointing as virtually no seasoning.  The calamari was ok as it was lightly breaded and I personally prefer that, the aioli was good.. The pizzas were pretty good, and the shrimp cocktail was good.  Service was descent
Had a team dinner here while in Vegas for work.  Good laid back restaurant, food was good and I didn't feel like we were wide open to the casino (as there are bathrooms inside and they make it really feel separate).  The appetizers were good - blue cheese chips and Steak skewers.  Calamari was just ok.  Two of us shared a pizza and it was perfect size after having appetizers.  The burger looked TDF.  The best part was desserts and they let use do 6 as two sampler plates, highly recommend doing that.  The banana cheesecake was amazing.  The others were really good also, even the carrot cake and I don't like carrot cake typically!  Good addition to the MGM.
We went here really late at night/early in the morning. We were fortunate enough to get awesome food at 3am. Thank goodness there wasnt a long wait and they were still open!!. . I got the spicy tuna tartar-too much mayo in my opinion & is not spicy . Salmon entree was good and the portions were good amount. Wild mushrooms were so good that we got a regular plate of just that...then got another plate!! 2 big plate of wild mushrooms. FTW!!. The broccolini sides were really good (it was a full plate size, too that we ordered!). . 1. Great after clubbing meal. 2. Awesome food for the late night meal. 3. Great sides. 4. Ambiance was really cute. 5. Great service & given that its 3am, everyone was so nice & attentive
I think calling this an upgraded TGIFriday's may be unfair, but that's my analogy.  You get a menu full of options and the food is pretty good.  I feel you are paying for the Wolfgang name though as it is pricy.  The restaurant is middle of the MGM casino with no walls so the atmosphere is loud and the sounds of slots is prevalent.  If I'm going to pay a high price, I really don't need the sounds of penny slots and loud patrons.
Enjoyed our meal at this place so much we came back three times during our stay. Tried the calamari, pizza and hamburger.  Hamburgers are excellent, huge fresh and cooked well done as requested.  I would suggest splitting one among 2 people they were that big.  Appetizer, calamari was just ok, pizza was a bit undercooked for my liking I prefer well done.  Service varied but adequate most of the time.
Having experienced terrible service and food at a fairly expensive restaurant during a previous visit, my group decided to find something well-recommended and decently priced. Also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was right by KA, it won!. . We were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on Sunday, but still busy]. The decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass "walls"]. The restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for KA and was right near the MGM casino. My friend noticed after dinner that there were a ton of servers, but only one female server which was quite the opposite of... everywhere! . . The waiter seemed very jazzed about dinner and explaining everything, and we were worried when he didn't write anything down, but he was awesome! Braden was nice, funny, got everything right, and he was great about checking in with us. Our water glasses were always full, and our food was amazing! There were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].. . My mouth was watering just reading the menu, but I wasn't feeling great so I thought I'd pick smaller options--hah! I got Mac'n Cheese and Roasted Cauliflower. The Mac'n Cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. Two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. My sister got the gourmet burger. It was $25 and SO worth it! She asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful!It came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. I believe my boyfriend got the Italian sausage pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size. . . The only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery. We agreed that this place was pretty great, and if we're ever in Vegas again we'll have to try one of Puck's other restaurants! . . Last bit--they had quite a large group in there at several long tables, so they can accommodate big groups!
The food was delicious and the service was friendly. It was our first time eating there.We did eat there for lunch. It's a bit expensive but great food.
I'm a big fan of this place, although they have a few fixable flaws.  . . the crabcake appetizer with creole mustard sauce is so good it is worth the $18 price.  the pizzas are good, but the linguini with clams is better - the taste of the italian bacon brings out the flavor.  the lasagna is very good but will clog an artery.  . . Wine selection by the glass is very small and unimpressive.  The servers are not overly friendly - I was here 4 times in less than a week and the same bartenders didn't seem to recognize me.  . . tip : look at the menu at nearby Joel Robuchon before looking at this menu, and these prices will seem reasonable by comparison.
Mmmm, every bite I ate was better than the last.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal.  I ordered the Maytag Bleu cheese chips for an appetizer and fully plan to go back for another one of these before I go home - so yummy.  They were simple - homemade potato chips with bleu cheese sauce topping them, but they were the favorite appetizer among the group I was with.  For dinner, I had the special - an 8oz filet, crusted with blue crab and served with some kind of spiced bearnaise sauce (I forget what the spice was).  On the side, I opted for the crispy Tuscan potatoes.   Everything was really delicious.  The steak was cooked just a little rare for my taste (I ordered medium), but I have come to expect this with filet as it's so thick.  The bearnaise, oh the bearnaise.  I could have ordered a bowl full of it.  The crab crust on top was also very tasty.  The bearnaise and crab elevated the steak, and the combination was perfect.  I highly recommend the Tuscan potatoes.  They are simple - red skinned potatoes, sliced and tossed with olive oil, salt and some herbs, then flash fried.  They were great.  I was almost talked into the fries, as they are supposed to be excellent. I had the opportunity to try some from one of my tablemates, and they were good, but fries are fries.  So glad I went with the potatoes instead.  . . Now, the ambiance...  It is nicely decorated and our server was very good.  He gave us excellent advice and recommendations.  It is very LOUD, however.  The restaurant has a patio effect, and is open to the casino, passerby, etc.  They have music playing on top of all of that exterior noise, and in order for it to be heard, the music has to be quite loud.  When our server was on the other side of the table explaining the specials, I couldn't hear a word he said.  I was with a group of seven, and I had no hope of hearing those at the other end of the table.  By the time we left, my voice was scratchy as if I had been to a concert.. . In summary - food was absolutely fantastic.  I'm going back for lunch just to eat it again.  But don't go if you're looking for a quiet, peaceful or romantic dinner.
Little overpriced but not beyond what I expected for Vegas. Pizza was good but service was even better.  Had a meatball and margarita pizza - both had good flavor
