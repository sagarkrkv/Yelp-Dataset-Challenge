Hate this place the staff is not helpful at all and I asked to speak to a manger about a room key that was defective. I got handed over to a bunch of different people only to be left without a Key and locked out of my room for the whole night ... ( no I wasn't drunk the staff is crappy )
Visiting Paris Las Vegas is kind of like a trip to Paris, France. No worries, you won't need a guide book. Check yourself in, eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double, and end up kissing strangers - or is that just me? Don't ask.. . They say a lot of things about Paris ... it's a place to find inspiration ... a place to discover something new about life ... a place to find love. I say it's a place to discover your fate. Sadly for me, fate seems to be the Paris casino tables liberating my money in ridiculous fashion. Fate should be when people meet on a train or in a Paris cafe and not in line at the ATM machine.. . Most people go to Paris, France to fall in love ... while at Paris Vegas, people go for the prime center-Strip location/views plus the good fortune of not having to actually talk to French people. . . The beautiful exterior with iconic Eiffel Tower, Montgolfier Balloon, and Arc de Triomphe are photo op spots un deux trois. Inside, the Casino is like a small French village under a sunny blue sky. Two restaurants with views are Mon Ami Gabi (patio view of the Bellagio Fountains) and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (view of the Strip). Don't forget, you're either in a cafe in Paris or a coffee shop in Vegas. . . Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino is a quaint charming theme hotel in the heart of the Strip, but without better luck at the tables or lower prices, my preference is other hotels in Vegas.Even so, we'll always have Paris ... at least until somebody builds the Berlin Hotel & Casino next door.
This is by far the worse place I have stayed on the stripe ever for the price. I expected better rooms and an overall experience.  I was dismayed over the lack of a coffee pot in the room.  I ordered a pot of coffee for the morning and the fee without tip was $20.  It was good coffee, but seriously, coffee cost something like 8 cents to make.. . The place does need some updating. I found that having ripped wallpaper in the halls and the design around the room outdated.  Again, this would have been acceptable for a lower cost room.  . . This place needs to update the rooms or drop the cost of rooms.  I will not be staying here and we go to Vegas about ever 9 months.
As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.
What a disappointment.  The hotel and rooms is dated but pretty clean.   I'm sure it was great in its day, but there was worn carpet, mystery stains, the bathroom mirror frame was delaminating, the mattress creaked, wall paper was torn, and the wardrobe had veneer peeling off of it.   Right outside our room there was a hole kicked in the wall.  On the main floor where its designed to be Paris streets, everything is dingy and depressing, the novelty wears off as you walk for probably a half mile to the parking garage or monorail.  The front desk is surrounded by casino, so you have to walk through the smokey slot area to check in and then get to your room.. . The cable tv has about 5 basic cable channels we would all expect, and the rest are weird international channels in other languages.  Wifi is $15 per day and dropped the connection consistently.
I stayed at the Paris now several times. At first they prided themselves for having no resort fees, then they added resort fees, and now they even have the audacity to charge for printing out a boarding pass for their guests.  The excuse of an utterly uncaring manager was "the concierge service was taken over by a private firm and they can change whatever they want."  Nice going!  - After getting a room with a non working safe, now that.  No way we will ever stay at this place again where the basics of customer service have completely gone lost.  Well, I guess that the true Paris, France experience. ;-)
AMAZING how all the staff here speak fluent French!!!! Not really :). . I just don't like how claustrophobic the place feels!  They have a painted ceiling that looks like the sky and the feel of walking down a street in Paris.  Very closed in feeling that Ido not like.  Very similar to how they did NY NY, trying to give you the feel of being there, but just too closed in for my liking.. . Otherwise I did like the red guest room we stayed in!  It was clean and spacious.  Careful of the marble floors in the bathroom though, I found it to be slippery... . . Good location on the middle of the strip.
I recently stayed at the Paris for a business trip. Overall, it was a good experience for me. Some of my colleagues experienced problems with their rooms (i.e. dirty, various stains, broken appliances, etc.), but my room was very clean and comfortable.. . The location is good (right on The Strip and in the middle of the action). It has several restaurant and shopping choices and is very walkable. The Eiffel Tower restaurant had fantastic food. I wasn't a fan of the decor (it felt very 1970s to me), the food and service was superb. . . What I didn't love about the Paris is that I was overcharged twice at two different restaurants there. In one instance, the cashier rang me up twice (a simple mistake). The other instance the cashier/barista gave themselves a considerable tip at my expense. I used to work in a restaurant and had a co-worker that would "add on" to what the customer left for a tip. I only discovered this once I started checking my transactions history. I did call the Paris and they were able to remedy it promptly. . . Overall, it was a good experience. It was good for the price and location.
I didn't stay here but we spent a little time at the machines at the bar and really liked it. I don't like gambling, find machines boring and tables expensive and sometimes boring too.. . We were just sat having a beer, with the Parisian surrounds and a wonderful atmosphere. Whoever designed all of this has done a wonderful job because it feels absolutely magical.
Isn't it strange how the little things can sour your experience? I had a good time at Paris, the dealers were friendly, the staff was nice, the rooms were clean until I was checking out and the guy at the taxi line started yelling that my car was parked to far over. And he kept screaming and gesturing until I moved my car over until it was blocking traffic, which I was trying to avoid in the first place. I usually stay here but I won't be anymore. He was the guy on duty 2/17 at 12pm.
Clean Rooms, hot water, quiet.  But I did not like the little trick they pull with advertising 'Free Wi-Fi'.  'Free Wi-Fi' means free for only one device per day, so if you got a tablet and a laptop, take your pick.  And you pay a 'resort fee' of $20 per day for that 'Free Wi-Fi, local calls, and a fitness center.
