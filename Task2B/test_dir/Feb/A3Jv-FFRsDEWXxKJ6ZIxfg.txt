Wow Gordon you really need to do a field trip visit to your Pub so disappointed I don't know where to begin.  Firstly hubby  and friends ordered the fish and chips I had the butternut squash soup.  Within in four minutes of ordering our food even before out drinks showed up out comes our food.  So hear we go  you can't call garden peas bashed with a spoon mushy peas anyone who knows anything about British food knows mushy peas have to go through a process to be entitled to that name.  The food tasted reheated which it had to be unless they have the fastest deep fat fryer known to man.  Chips were soggy French fries and I won't even try to describe the tasteless mushy Cod (peas mushy fish not is a good way to go.  Soup was ok just ok but for $13 I was expecting some flavour.  Thought I would mention to the manager how disappointed we were and not Yelp.  He was so not bothered and I was very diplomatic he said he would look into and just walked back to the front desk.  Come on people show you at least care and Gordon if you are going to put your name to something please at least check they are doing your name some favours I am a huge fan but not of this place.  We sat at 8.15 and were out of there by 8.50 these guys make MacDonalds look slow.  Give it a miss folks.
We came here for their Super Bowl party.  Such a good time!  The food was tasty, service friendly and the beer kept on flowing!  Ask for RayRay at the bar, he will take great care of you!
I was very disappointed by this place. If you watch any of Gordon Ramsey's shows he always talks about quality. This was very poor quality food. Frozen fries, weird watery meat in Shepard Pie, and a rather bland in eventful burger. It is also expensive. . . Just blahhhh.. . The whole Gordon Ramsey thing isjust an act to sell overpriced food. . . The winner of his Chef show that was supposed to be the Chef of the restaurant failed her drug test so she is not there either. So they are just a ship at sea with no sail. . . I have spent time in England and this is very much on par with British food. It is pretty bad.
This place exceeded every expectation I ever imagined.  The Scottish egg appetizer was perfectly prepared with a runny yolk.The pub lamb burger was heavenly. The beef cheek sandwich was really well cooked with a nice horseradish sauce. The Bass on draft was smooth.   Coming back for dessert for tomorrow night.
Good sliders but too generate, not cool enough for Chef Ramsey.  Sliders had basted buns and great moist meat.
This is a classier looking, English pub style counterpart to the series of Gordon Ramsay restaurants around the strip. During my weekend trip, I ate here and at Brgr. Both had memorable dishes that I'm not likely to forget.. . The sticky toffee pudding is what took the cake for me here. It was magnificent. I've never had anything like it. Definitely made me feel like I might have diabetes after eating, but it was well worth it.. . The staff here are super friendly and above all, patient. I needed a moment to look online to make sure the root beer options they offered were caffeine-free (both were) because I have a heartissue, so any mistakes wouldn't fair me too well. I really appreciated how kind the waiter was about it.. . My husband loved his pork belly so much that he wanted to attempt to make his own when we got home tonight!
They take boring pub food and make it taste good.   The pork chop was the best.  Great service from all.  Had the chicken come out cold.  They took care of it right away and com the one meal.  Things go wrong how you How you it makes the difference   Very good
Gordon Ramsay needs to take his name off this mess. The beer selection is great. The service was decent. The portions were small... small portions at a pub? The food was nothing special. 4 non spectacular dinners and two small beers $140. Dollar for dollar the worst disappointment of the trip. We ate foot long hot dogs within two hours in the forum shops. Next time I will spend a little more money and eat somewhere nice or spend a little less and eat at a real pub.
We did family style and ordered the chicken, fish and chips, mac n cheese, and lamb burger.  For me, I would just go back for the fish and chips. Everything else was just mediocre. However, for lunch it was quite expensive. The waiter was nice. Not sure if I would come back.
How a cranberry vodka drink can taste so special is beyond me! The bartenders here are ridiculously good at what they do. They take their s*** seriously.  Everyone around us was in OOOHS and AHHS over the sheer perfection of their drink.  I had a moment (maybe a buzzed one) where I thought "Wow.... mixed drinks are an art".  I like it.  . . And since I didn't want to eat a full meal, I decided to splurge on a few appetizers to share.   Deviled eggs (with bacon), pretzel, and olives. All fantastic - particularly the eggs; they got a little creative with them (but nothing too far out there!).  . . Will be back!
Second visit and still Ray Ray taking care of us at the bar. I ordered the fish and chips and wife had the butternut squash soup. I grew up in the U.K on fish and chips so I've had a few in my lifetime. The beer battered cod was everything you'd expect. I'm taking off a 1/2 point as you never get shoestring chips in England. The fries were a bit of a disappointment. I'm adding a half point on how well they did the peas. First you have to like peas and then again you need to like mint as it's seems to me a combo dish. Personally loved it. Wife had the butternut squash soup and practically licked the bowl. Bartender service outstanding. Will be back next visit.
Awesome.. . Would love to give this place a five, but I can't. And here's why.. . The location is right on the casino floor and for me, this is not a good thing. The service was also pretty slow and more importantly, the portions were not mindblowing; especially compared to similar restaurants nearby.. . The menu was compelling, and the cocktails were outstanding. A really enjoyable meal.
I wouldn't have even given this place 1 star but I had to choose something. The burgers in our party had none of the toppings stated on the menu and were flavorless, my sliders were sent back twice and came back both times raw. There was a beer spilt on someone in our party and a new one wasn't even brought to the table. The manager was nice and chalked it up to a "new menu rollout" and in the end we were given a discount but won't be back. Too many great choices in vegas that have good food and great service.
Been here twice..food and service are always great...lamb burger was great and I highly recommend the Innis and Gunn beer...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fries that came with my burger were crap...oily, limp and no flavor...very disappointed with the fries...the lamb burger and beer made up for it
Before going to Pure Nightclub on Valentines night I came here for dinner. I never have been to a Gordon Ramsay eating establishment before. I watched him on TV however I didn't know what my expectations were. After eating here, this eatery met my expectations. Since this is an English pub it made sense to order the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not a big fan of meat pies as they tend to be heavy. This meat pie was hearty. I love the mashed potato covering on the pie as it had that outer crust. In addition the mashed potato was creamy and not heavy. Regarding the meat there is a contrasting texture with the minced beef and lamb that makes the dish very appetizing. Everyone mentions about the Sticky Toffee Dessert but for dessert I ordered the Spotted "Dic". I liked how the warm bread pudding meshed with the cold ice cream. I would have given a higher rating had it not been for the Truffle Chips. I expected the chips to be a thick cut chip. Instead the chips were the typical skinny cut. Overall I had a good dinner Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.
OMG!!  I couldn't wait to write my review for this place. For one I love Gordon Ramsay and this is the first time I've been to any of his restaurants!  . . My awesome friend and I came here after shopping and the service was great.  Our servers name was Mike and he was really tentative and provided great input for the drinks and food on the menu.  . . Based on his recommendation I ordered the Pub Crawl... I was in the mood for something where I could taste the alcohol.  I never had bourbon and I wanted to try something new... Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there). . So the food.. Uhh so good.. For the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b/c I've never had anything like it.. . For the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.. . I know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.  I can't wait to go back on my next visit!!  We were definitely in food heaven going here!!  I will save a little room for dessert on round 2 and I will try some of Ramsay's other places on the next visit.
A testament to my Yelp loyalty. I should have read some reviews. . . Our server was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. The unfortunate news is that this review solely reflects the food. . . The scotch eggs were a good starter (I love HP sauce), and it all went downhill from there. We also ordered the pretzel starter, and there was no warning on how hot the mustard was! I love heat in a dish, but there should have been some warning. I dunked that sucker all the way in not realizing that it would take my breath away. It came with 3 under seasoned pretzel sticks, and the cheese sauce was nearly tasteless. . . My pulled chicken sandwich came out soggy from the kitchen. The over application of cheese and sauce created a gooey sandwich I was not expecting; The ciabatta bread did not hold up. If they had grilled it on a panini press, it would have been a different story!. . I had a few bites of my boyfriend's fish and chips. It was better than my sandwich, but there was no seasoning. To their credit, the fish was fresh and flaky, but there was no flavor to it at all without the tartar sauce.. . The meal wasa surprising disappointment.
My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans, but this place was a giant disappointment. The food and service were both average at best. . . - I ordered a pint of Boddington's (draught) which should have been $8. When the bill came it was $11. I asked the server why it was $11 and he said because it was a 20 oz. I am still trying to figure out how they squeezed 20 oz's of Boddington's into a pint glass. Hmmm..... . - My wife ordered a diet Pepsi and it was $4. Wow! . . - I ordered the Chicken Curry. It took about 25 minutes to come out and when it arrived the portion wasn't the biggest, the sauce was good, the rice was fine, but the chicken was undercooked (pink). Definitely not worth the $24 price tag.. . Would I go back? No.
Excellent service and food. Had the pub burger and toffee for dessert. Burger was juicy and very tasty. The dessert was the icing on the cake so to speak.
First visit - just a beer and a free appetizer because the kitchen or bar staff messed up an order.  Bar service was average, but the free appetizer was very good (pretzels w/ dips - not good just because it was free.). . Second visit - dinner with my lady. Great service and average food. I had the shepherds pie. Good, but expected great for the price. Pint of Lagunitas IPA was $11..... . . Third visit - just about midnight and the hostess asked if I just wanted drinks. As my answer was yes, I followed the group of 4 that were just ahead of me into the bar area. The main bar was full, so I took a seat at the end of the adjacent bar, a mere 5 feet from the main bar.  With a slight lean, I could have touched the shoulder of the gentlemen at the end.  After waiting for about 5 minutes and repeated eye contact with the main bar bartenders, a lady came up to let me know they were closed.  So I asked why the hostess showed me in... I was told they may be open at the main bar... 5ft away... But as far as she knew, they were closed.. . My disappointment comes from 2 directions:. . - big name with a reputation, I had high expectations.  Didn't come close.. . - outspoken critic of poor restaurants is failing at this location. Might want to pay a visit to the establishment with your name on it.... . On the other hand - Ramsay's Burgr at Planet Hollywood is FABULOUS.  We have been there 3 times and received impeccable service and food every time!
Great service. Great food. Right after Celine Dion show. Make reservations on a Saturday. Busy. Lobster Mac n Cheese is the bomb. Sliders and fish and chips were excellent. Thumbs up
I love Gordon Ramsey but 21 bucks for two small pieces of fish and some fries that were cold come on!! On top if that, I had to listen to some manager yelling at a server for something like moving a chair so I could sit down was just crazy. Not impressed of the two out of three of his restaurants I've Been to, its strike two. Maybe steak will knock it out of the park.
Three stars for the food, but the wait staff did a great job and did their best to make up for my cold food. We went in with high expectations given this is one of Gordon Ramsay's establishments.  There was a mix up in the kitchen so my meal was cool rather than hot. I have to say the flavor was there. I had the prime rib but they forgot to put the beef drippings on the Yorkshire pudding which left me with a partial meal. Mr Ramsay would have had something to say about it for sure. Natalie was a very good waitress and she went above and beyond to make sure I left the restaurant happy. Everyone else in our party was pleased with their meals. I will revisit and update the review based on my next visit. One more chance Ramsay.
Usually I don't like to give poor reviews but this needs to be addressed. Before I even read any prior Yelp reviews about this place, we had a discrepancy with our check. Once we got our check, we took notice that the amount charged for each item (Calamari, Salmon, and Chicken lollipops) were higher than what was stated on the menu. Because, we already received a discount with our comps we decided not to complain about the issue. However, I was informed by  my friend that another guest had experiences the same problem in which she read on Yelp.. . Food - it was actually above mediocre for bar food! I especially liked the French Onion! The decor was trendy and meshed well together, all the way down to the silverware. Kudos to the interior designer and restaurant consultant that created the vision and theme. Even the music, Depeche Mode and The Clash, was on point! . . Service - Disappointing. Server is on his phone in clear sight of guests. The table behind us actually had to get up and tap a server on the shoulder to get assistance. The server, in turns, mocks the guest to another co-worker a few minutes later. Although, the server and server assistant were cordial to us and even doing their touch backs, professionalism lacked.. Hostess did do the initial verbal greet and eye contact but lacked personality.
Just what I would expect from Gordon Ramsay.  This place was awesome, great atmosphere, drinks and good.  My wife and I just stopped in for apps and a drink. I had the onion soup and my wife had the pretzels, both were really good.  The bartender recommended a English beer if never had before that was really good, not something I would've normally ordered.  The   Staff was great.  We are a huge fan of his shoes do it was really cool to finally go to one if his restaurants. I would definitely recommend stopping in here.  The only drawback of any is it is a little pricy but it's worth it.
How do I describe my experience here? Horrible and pathetic. If my name were on the place, I'd verify the quality. First, took and hour to get appetizers. Second, two hours for good with a "medium" requested burger clearly "rare."  I would not only not recommend this place, I would persuade people against it. Horrible worst burger I've ever had.
this is review for the lamb burger only. really enjoyed it, not greasy but juicy. cooked to near perfection.
We came here for our last night in Vegas. The food was OK for the money, but honestly Umami burger or the Counter is equal if not better. I will say that my drink the garden spritz was awesome! . . We had the lamb burger and the regular burger. The lamb burger was great, but the other burger had to be sent back, it was supposed to be rare but it came out medium, and we requested truffle oil on our fries, but that didn't happen either. Props does go out to our waitress ( I do not have her name :(, but she lived in Mexico prior) who took care of us, she insisted on returning the burger and fixed the fries. We also had the sticky pudding, which I'd order again and the bread pudding was also yummy. . . I guess the one thing that bothers me is that on Kitchen Nightmares you have Mr. Ramsay saving other restaurants, but this our third time at one of his and I have yet to say Wow, you can tell Gordon Ramsay "the dude from TV" owns this place. . . The floor to the bathroom was so greasy my husband and I had to hold on while walking. We were joking about the lawsuit that is just waiting to happen. And the men's bathroom was missing toilet paper and when they brought it, it didn't fit the holder. Silly things that are huge lazy oversights from management and are the kind of things that Mr. Ramsay would fix on his TV show. . . So, Mr. Ramsay if you or your staff read this, keep in mind that we don't just rate the food. I was a restaurant/bar manager in NYC for 11 years and I totally understand things happen, but if it hadn't been for our waitress, who seemed to be acting out of her experience and not out of her GR P& G training, I would have given you two stars.
Yeah yeah... so I'm late with a few reviews.. what else is new? . . So... we went to dine here over Christmas week.  Jerry Seinfeld had a show we were attending and we just came to this place by chance.  Because we were early enough there was no wait for a table.  And because this is his 3rd restaurant we've been to, we had high expectations, even if it was "a pub."  . . Starting out, I'd say that the service was chaotic.  No one came to our table after we were sat for a while.  I distinctly remember because I tried to figure out who our server was based on the hustling of servers around us, but not even those servers ever looked at us and said, "Someone will be right with you, we'll have someone bring over waters, nothing." There was NO teamwork at all, just unorganized chaos. . . So hubby drank a Boddington's which he can usually get at home for $1.99, and I had a martini.  Drinks were good since we knew what to expect. That is really, the best part of this whole dining experience.  Their menu was lacking at first glance.  Nothing I saw made me wish I could have more than one item...in fact after we'd been sat so long I kind of wish we could of gotten up and gone somewhere else..... . But anyway, an English Ale soup and burger later we were at least not starving before the show.  But for counting this as one of our meals in Las Vegas...it was really disappointing.  I'm not giving it one star because the server that did come to us in the end was decent and tried her best.   Would I come back here for any reason?  Oh I think not.  So many places to wine and dine in Las Vegas, are you insane???  In fact... I hear the Oyster Bar calling my name......
What a place! . . First off I like to start off with the staff they, are freaking awesome. Not only are they very tentative, but they are super friendly, and they provide the necessary accommodations  to make one feel welcome. The decor was pretty cool as well. . . The most important thing  that I can generate from this review is the food. . . It tastes so fresh and delicious I could just eat a plethora and not get tired of eating here.. .  I had the braised pork belly. It was so soft, tender and juicy that I wanted more. The seasoning used on this was really delicious.. . The pretzel was decent nothing out of this world. (and that all I have to say about that). . . For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding, this was actually my favorite part. It closed my meal all the way around. . . I would highly recommend this place prices are a little steep, but still congenial.
We sat at the bar to ensure attentive service.  Team service was excellent.  Ordered the prime rib, it was cooked to order, and I was pleased.  I previously had the fish and chips here and I was disappointed, but this visit was okay.  I think that this place just performs well enough to get by with over-stimulated vegas visitors.
Wasn't very impress with this place.  Service was ok and food was pricey and not worth it. Definitely not coming back.
