The place isn't fancy but it's comfortable. The service is quick and professional. The restaurant is sort of small so go early or make a reservation.. . Everything we tried was tasty and the price was right.  The Honey Bread is downright sinful (but in the best possible way) and the noodles are the perfect texture. Beef tongue was tender, the garlic gizzards are worth ordering and the miso butter fish just melted in my mouth.. . The menu is huge and can be overwhelming.  I found it helpful to look at what other diners were ordering and order it too!
Ive been there several time for menu selection. There have a lot of good menu to choose from  But the service is not good whenever I go there and the cleanness is bad even though they have open kitchen
Short: Nice for a change, good food, some decent prices. But service lacks, and sometimes not worth what you pay for.. . I've been here twice with a friend (who raves of it), but both experiences were varied.. Walking into this place feels like you've walked into a small izakaya in Japan. It's instant. Wrapped bar, large sitting area, and side tables all cramped into the small place. Lovely.. . Lunch special was good and well worth the price. No problems there.. Dinner was a different story. While there are some great choices, a large portion of the main part of the menu isn't worth the price.. I ordered some yakatori (chicken skewers) and other meats on skewers, with a side of a couple kushikatsu (deep fried on skewers). When my and my friend's order came, we were surprised on the portion size: Two skewers for around $2. Great, right? No, that was a order of two, and each skewer is about 6" inches long--very small for what I was expecting. Having a taste of them, they weren't all that great. Flavor was good, but tough meat (chicken gizzards was very hard).. . . I had a big hassle both times with the service. Food was always brought out whenever the servers felt like it, so while my friend ate, I had to sit around for my food to come. There was a mix up with the orders and quantity, and it was also hard to get the server's attention at times. . . Bottom line: I wouldn't return to deal with the service. The lunch service is very good, and happy hour (2:30-5) is worth it as well. Just not dinner, and not anything on skewers--as I see it.
I go here every time we hit Vegas with the girls.  It's super legit Japanese food - takes me back to my child and teenage years - with yaki-ika and (apparently) killer natto.  I say 'apparently' because I don't eat that stuff but the BFF loves it.  Whatever you do and whatever you eat or drink, finish it off proper with an order of honey toast; you will not regret it.
The best Japanese restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas. It is small, so you should try to make a reservation if you want to go there during peak hours.
Where have you been all my life, Ichiza?. . Sushi, Ramen, and anything else Japanese? In one little space? . . I was intimidated by the wait at first, but what started as an hour wait ended up being only 25 minutes when several other parties cancelled. And thankfully, this appears to happen A LOT. But just remember, while it's not required, reservations do come highly suggested.. . As a party of four, we all went in on the menu! One friend got sushi, another got mackerel, I got Japanese-style chow mein and gyoza and the fourth friend got something that begins with "oppa" (not sure how it's spelled). It's all perfect for sharing. I liked everything except the mackerel (and I don't like mackerel in the first place so the restaurant is at no fault for that).. . Everything on the menu is really cheap by itself, but be mindful that everything does add up really quickly. We were quite surprised by our bill at the end of the meal.. . Oh and did I mention I loved the ambiance? Between the low tables, the backless chairs, the small space with warehouse lighting, the large crowds and the Japanese written all over the walls, I really did feel like I had just been transported to Tokyo, and not just an Asian-themed strip mall in Las Vegas.. . Pros:. The ambiance. Menu has loads of variety and very reasonable prices. Frequent and friendly service who won't get annoyed if you add more and more to your plate. . Cons:. Small space leading to (possible) long waiting times to be seated and served. While each individual item is inexpensive, it can all add up really quickly if you're not paying attention. . Return Factor: I'd love to
Food was decent, but the manager on duty was super shady. First, no service, we didn't get napkins or water until 20 mins later when we asked for it. At the end, I paid with cash, and waited for change, but there was less $10 bill when the manager gave us the change. When we confronted him about it, he said there might've been a mistake and he corrected it. This is just not right, some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change, and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!
Ichiza another great place  to eat and drink hang out with a group of friends in Vegas ...Great yakitori  there beef tataki are awesome ika-yaki good. There whole wall is basically a menu so don't be shy to ask the waiter waitress what are they. There's so many other good things also And for dessert don't forget just ordered a honey toast..... I'll be coming back soon. Make sure to make reservations it's get kinda crowded.
Hmm.... if you're from LA, this place would be very average for any izakaya in Torrance or SGV.   For LV, this is near, if not top, since it's got over 900+ reviews at 4+.   Anyhow, we tasted many items across the board and they're all solid.    I would highly recommend you to just buy out the entire popular list.  It's about 10 items but it's a good start point for the rest of the order. . . Other tidbits, it's on the 2nd floor, call ahead for reservation....
Ichiza....Ichiza....What can I say?? This place is great!! I was brought their by some friends because  of their Honey toast... It was late we ate at a sushi house and topped it off with their honey toast. The honey toast is something out of this world... Toast, honey, and ice cream thats it! it is amazing! I have gone back to the point where I dont even count now. The have such great food.  The beef tataki is crazy good, raw beef, ponzu sauce. Try it, It is def something out of the box but you will be glad you did! also I tend to get the Buta Kimchi with a side of rice. Its something you cant go wrong with and it is highly recommend from me.  The atmosphere is great, very inviting and can get crazy because they get so busy no matter what time it is or what day it is. Sitting at the bar is an experience and you should try it at least once, you get to see all that goes into each dish and its pretty amazing how efficiently everything is. If you are in chinatown please stop by this place and be surprised how good this place is and then go tell all your friends!
Very good. Got the stir fried beef tongue, deep fried garlic, whole squid and some sushi rolls. All were very yummy! We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas! Until next time ichiza!
Reminds me of Sapporo in NYC. Which is closed. But was so cozy and cool. Which this place is. Wish you could still have a cigarette while you waited for your honey toast. Word to the wise... Order off the specials on the wall. That menu shit is Mickey Mouse stuff. Alsoooo.... The Mariah Carey Destinys Child jams blasting while I enjoyed my amazing meal was a goddamn legit crown jewel on my ultimate dining experience. Can't wait to come back.
I am simply rating based on the Honey Toast since that is the only thing I ate when I went there. Some people said "it's not worth all the hype". NO! IT IS WORTH ALL THE HYPE. the doughy center is beyond amazing, the honey, the toast is toasted perfectly. The only way to make it better is to use homemade or thrifty ice cream.
Wow did this place shock me.  We can't get a restaurant like this in North Carolina so we were super excited to go and it lived up the expectations.  The items are small and greatly priced.  This allows you to order lots of things and try different things. The raw octopus was the best I've ever had. The squid was very good. The waitress was very helpful we even showed her pictures from yelp & said we wanted that and she knew what we wanted.  The beers were cold.  . . Pictures are the best for this place...def use as a recommendation. Save room for dessert you have to try the toasted bread thing....Amazzzzing!!
