MGM GRAND! I'm very disappointed! I've had a really bad experience with you guys last summer!. . I've had already booked my room and it's paid for and everything, when i came to check in after a long eventful night they didn't let me check in! They said that all their rooms is booked! THAT IS NONSENSE! and even though i was willing to pay for the early check in fee, they keep telling us to come back until its check in time, every time we came back they still did not let us check in! Everyone keeps telling us the wrong time on purpose either because they don't want me and my bf to stay in their hotel so me and my bf have to sleep in our car! So they couldn't find the room that I booked so one girl that actually tried to help us out helped me charge my phone so i can show her the email confirmation, she was still giving us a hard time when i showed her the email confirmation! after awhile, she finally gave us a room with two bed that we don't even need, because she said that is the only room they have available and so i ended having to pay more that i shouldn't even have to!  I don't understand why me and my bf was being treated like this, wasting and giving us a hard time and not letting us book a room...after we just wanted to rest from a long eventful day, they were either being stereotyping or judging us because we saw another couple that came back from the same event as we did and they got a room just like that!  So we asked those couple how did they get a room...and they said that they just give us a room, now that totally pissed me off. What is wrong with you guys MGM? Is this how you guys treat your customers?? With that said, I don't think i will ever book a room with MGM GRAND again.
Don't book a suite here,unless you don't mind living in the streets of Vegas. . . Our group of 8 booked and paid for our suite months in advance for EDC weekend. After waiting days to check in, we were told that they didn't have a suite for us since they overbooked. We were PISSED. It's one of the busiest weeks in Vegas and now you expect us to successfully find another place to stay? They didn't even try to help us.. . After wasting the whole day sorting this out, we eventually ended up staying in separate rooms at a hotel elsewhere. We tried making the best out of the situation but not having our suite was definitely disappointing. . . I'm going to Vegas again next week and we booked the same suite at MGM (not my decision) so I'm praying we don't get eff'ed over again.
We got a great deal to stay in the MGM from Hotwire. It was 50 dollars a night with an amazing view of the strip. I could not believe how cheap the hotel was. The interior of the hotel was really beautiful. It was nice and clean it had a huge wall size window. The view of the strip was best seen at night. . . I did get annoyed of the green light. But it wasn't a big deal. i think I got use to it after the second night we stayed... They offered us 20 bucks off on the MGM buffet which was totally worth it because the food was pretty good. It was not the best buffet in Vegas but it was very good. The mimosas in the morning was a perfect hangover remedy. haha. . I would definitely book MGM through Hotwire again. This place was exactly what I expected from a Vegas Hotel. Clean and Affordable and Great Location!
all ok . if youlike big hotels and get treated like cattle MGM is your hotel. this was  really the  only hotel that didn't stink that bad of tobacco smoke
need sooo much updating.  bad smells and dirty rooms.
Stayed for 2 nights in the worlds second largest hotel. We opted to stay in the executive king suite. It wasn't really much more than a standard room. It was great! We had a nice, very spacious room with a great view. I especially like the automatic blinds and decor. It was very clean and comfortable. They also have free internet, but at 1mb, it's a little slow at times. Enjoyed the room and the casino very much. We will be back!
Great atmosphere in Decores the restaurant beautiful carpet photos on the wall took a little bit longer than normal to get the food but it was fair I've had a lot better and a lot warmer food served you will have to wait in line for about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated it picks a little bit longer than normal to receive your food after you order it they do need to make some improvements on that also was a little bit cooler than I thought I like hot food maybe because it Sunday prices are a little bit more higher than normal I may try it again if I'm back at the hotel but I always stop at a different hotel every time I'm in.
The hotel) Medium sized rooms, clean, but average and definitely not spacious.. Decor is somewhat ancient, as is the carpet and the paint on the walls of the corridors leading up to the room. Furniture is bare.. . The casino) Big casino with lots of restaurants, lots of show options, and lots of square footage. The lions are a sight to see. There are lots of gaming options and the pricing is moderate.. . The feel) Have had some rudeness from the employees, such as when I asked to see a seating chart before buying tickets.
This is hands down the most horrible casino I have ever stayed at. 2nd night we wake up to the ceiling dripping water and having hotel employees in and out of our room, early morning. 3rd. Night no running water at all in our room. So the toilet is full, no can wash there hands and no showers before we catch our flight. There is plenty if other casino's in Vegas, I will never use this one again.
First time in Vegas and decided to stay at MGM because a friend of mine suggested it. What a good choice. It's a perfect location because it's at the beginning of the strip so u could just walk up and down as opposed to starting in the middle of the strip. . . I had booked a regular room and upon check in the lady asked if we wanted to upgrade for $30 a night. I'm glad we did. The room was decently sized, and we had found out the room we originally booked was 100 square feet smaller! The overall room was nice though, clean, everything looked modern and new. Our view sucked though. . . Went to hakkasan on Friday night for calvin Harris and Sunday night for dada life. Would def recommend this club. Would def stay here again.
I stayed in September 2010. I have to say by far this is the best hotel I stayed at so far in Vegas.. . The location is more toward the South strip (by New York New York, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay) which is great because I find it to have more of a nightlife for the younger crowd. The hotel itself has amazing entertainment choices. I checked in at 2:30 in the morning and there were so many people enjoying the night at lounges and bars and restaurants. . . The staff was super friendly and nice. I got there and checked in within five minutes. He showed exactly where to go to get to the elevator and provided a map of the strip. . . Once I got there I headed downstairs to grab a bite. The front desk suggested Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill and I loved it. I had the calamari and a drink and the bartender was super nice and friendly. He knew what was good. . . The room itself was a bit smaller than what I expected but it was nice. I loved the hallway. You can't go wrong designing the hallway with marbles and granites. The bathroom was beautiful as well. Very simple but elegant. . . Will definitely stay here next time I am there.
I decided to give MGM another whirl after trying other hotels out on the strip. Although the MGM can sometimes be hit or miss, I will say that this time.. it was more of a hit. . . The check in routine here really lays the foundation of how poor or excellent your stay will be.. . . Our check-in went rather well for us this time around and the woman who helped was very efficient and made sure we had everything we needed. We had found a great deal through M LIfe and got a king suite for a great rate. Most likely because February 7-10 is somehwere in between holidays and not a whole lot going on. Anywho, the room was great,exactly what we had reserved. Not a bad view even from the 8th floor and the spa tub and shower were great. The room was truly an escape from the madness.. and we needed it after two nights of going hard at pub crawls, dinners and gambling.. ah what a life. Sheesh I sound like a prick. But in all seriousness, this hotel room suite was comfortable and big enough to host our party of 10 for pre-drinking.. . The casino and restaurants always come through at the MGM, and that is why, even after a bad experience here, I will still come back. . . Find the best and happiest check-in person upon arrival, and your stay will be fabulous here!
Stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here. I didn't like the place . Rooms where outdated . Casino was always busy and couldn't enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos
Being a Las Vegas native has it's ups for sure. We found out about the MGM "Stay Well" rooms and we are flabbergasted.  They are FANTASTIC!  Vitamin C infused shower water, therapy smells, and therapeutic sounds. This room is very clean, and the beds are super comfortable.  For a room this bad ass it was a great price! Even though we live here in Vegas we will DEFINITELY be back. :)
I've stayed here a couple of times for work, not very impressed.. . 1. EVERY single time, the front desk staff were rude and made me feel uncomfortable. Complete 180 from my experience with the staff at MGM Signature. I remember one time when I was checking in with 2 other co workers (we had 3 rooms), the man helping us looked like we stole from him then beat up his wife or something. He was rude, impatient and unhappy about the fact that he had to do his job three times since there were three separate rooms... . 2. The rooms however always exceeded my expectation. The amenities are actually kind of nice and the rooms are spacious. . . 3. The hotel also smells terrible. Starting from the lobby all the way to the hallway of my hotel room, yuck.
Really enjoyed ourselves here. Love the little shops and the Lion fountain. We were staying just over the road at Excalibur. Went to see a show at Brad Garret's Comedy Club which is a really nice club, check the line up before heading in.. . Our gambling extravaganza, if you want to call it that, extended to one of the blackjack tables where we really enjoyed ourselves. We're not huge gamblers but it's Vegas and it's the MGM!
I don't gamble so I can't speak in that area. I haven't stayed the night or eaten in this hotel either, so i cannot comment there. I have seen KA here though (cirque du soleil) and irather enjoyed that. Unfortunately the ending was garbage, but the rest of the show was great. Seems nice enough, A-OK for me
Hotel is mostly fine, its at the far end of the strip but has the monorail attached which is almost impossible to find.  I was certainly surprised by the secret extra fees!  I've been to Vegas many times and have stayed at many hotels, much nicer hotels, and have never experienced getting charged an extra $130 after my stay and after receiving a $0 balance bill at checkout.  We arrived early and were treated like we were special at check in even receiving a free early check in but no one told us about the extra $70/day we were about to be charged for "remodeled room, resort fee and taxes".  We never asked for or agreed to a "remodeled room" and if the room we stayed in was remodeled, I'd hate to see a room that wasn't.  I called and sat on hold for about 20 minutes until I finally spoke to a woman that was incredibly rude and condescending to me basically calling me stupid for thinking I could stay at the MGM without paying these fees.   I will never stay at the MGM or a sister hotel ever again and do not recommend it.  I've stayed at better hotels in Vegas and around the world for much less and no surprises!  Highly DO NOT recommend!
We arrived here on Valentines Day for a 4 day stay.  We stayed at the MGM Grand because the Eagles were playing live there and figured it would be more convenient to stay at the same place the Eagles were playing at.  We arrived from the airport which was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport via a taxi and only around $15 with tip and taxi service fees.  The line at check-in was very long.  It took about 20 minutes to check in.  The gal that helped us was really nice.  They gave us a room in the West Wing.  As we walked down the loooooooong hallways to our room we began to notice old suspended ceilings, smelly hall ways and ugly old decor.  We got to the room and was not excited to see what we had just flown 6 hours from Boston to stay in.  The room was tiny.  It had almost no bathroom.  The bath sink was in the room and not in the bathroom.  The toilet was located in the room but not in a separate bathroom.  It was like a closet door in the room.  We quickly decided we could not stay in this room.  We call down to the operator and was connected to some one who said they could not help us because the hotel was full.  I asked to speak to the manager and was given someone whom said the same thing and that the next day they could see if they had something better.  Feeling disappointed we went back down to the front desk and asked for the gal that checked us in.  She had mentioned at check in that if we were not happy to come back and see her.  She was sooo nice and was able to immediately change our room to the main towers.  We had reserved a king size bed but was willing to take the room with the double queen beds instead of the original room.  This new room was great.  It was on the 18th floor room 101.  It even had a nice view.  It would have been ice if the room had a refrigerator that the guest could use.  They had fully stocked refrigerator that you could not use because they had beer, booze, water etc in them and if you removed a item you would be charged.  The room did have a built in safe which was nice.  This room was very nice and the hall ways leading to the room was nice.  The food court was awesome.  The Eagles concert was unbelievable!!!  I was VERY surprised to find out that there was no non smoking area's in the casino!  I have never seen so many smokers in my life!!  The entire hotel smelled solely of cigarette smoke.  We are spoiled up here in New England that we have 2 casino's with non smoking area.  How can the MGM not designate a small non smoking area to their non smoking crowd?  The casino is HUGE and you can not tell me that a area could not be roped off for non smokers.  The smokers were not even considerate to non smokers.  Over all Vegas was a fun "people watching" place.  You'll see all kinds of interesting people and activities.  We saw the Jersey Boys at the Paris and loved that.  We took a ride to Freemont St in old Vegas.  It was honky tonk and for the $32 taxi ride each way was probably not worth the visit.  Walking around from hotel to hotel and people watching was fun!  They could of had more pools open with better beverage service.  The only pool open served only beer and wine.  Hope you enjoy your trip!
I have been staying at the MGM Grand for 20 years now and I'm a little mixed w feelings about this place. It started out best of the best but it slowly started making changes to their policies and procedures over the past 5 years. It's a big place w lots of amenities. The rooms are all updated and modernized. The restaurants are good but make a reservation. The casino floor is their best feature as it provides a fun and exciting atmosphere with lots of gambling options. Pools are great in the summer. Their VIP and players club MLife are typical, you have to be a big spender in order to get anything comped. They used to care about how long you have been a dedicated visitor but times have changed.
I stayed at the MGM recently and enjoyed the stay.  Jerry at the front desk was awesome and sorted out some difficulties.  He was very professional and considerate.. . Pluses:. -Central location with easy access to the tram and the monorail.. -Reasonably priced. -Fabulous restaurants:  .     Shibuya, which is a wonderful Japanese restaurant, designed lovely with friendly, knowledgable staff.  Consistently delicious food..     Wolfgang Pucks for California cuisine in a comfortable setting.  Very polite, accommodating and courteous service.. -Staff at the front desk (or at least Jerry!). -Staff in general seems to try to be helpful.. -Slot machines. -Pools. . Negatives:. -Terrible table crews at the craps table.  They appear very sour,  are not engaging and gossip amongst themselves while looking disdainfully at the customers.  They seem very burnt out on their jobs and very unprofessional. I ended up gambling elsewhere even though I was staying at the MGM!  Craps is my favorite game in Vegas! I would give them no stars if there was a separate rating.. -The remodel.  For example,  excellent quality doors that were quiet were replaced with cheap,  noisy doors that slam easily.  I was awakened early every morning by slamming doors.  Seems like such a waste.. -Housekeeping can be unresponsive,  I guess it just depends who answers the phone.  Very inconsistent.. -The scent that is in the hotel smells like stale cologne.  That,  mixed with the cigarette smoke is overwhelming.
I love this Hotel/Casino, the place is just always busy and hopping! They are very friendly, and not just to get you to gamble and spend money, when I got a MLife card to play some they were very nice and friendly. I even got a birthday Button since I was there on my birthday! I think I wanna stay here if I need to stay at a hotel in Vegas!
This is the first time I have ever stayed at the MGM. The front desk lady was extremely welcoming and referred us to the bell desk to have our desk at while we waiting for our room to be ready. After 3 hours, we got a call saying that our room was ready. After about 5 minutes of being in the room we got a call from the mechanic that our toilet handle is broken to which we respond I don't know what your talking about we just checked in. Come to find out it was broken so we had to call them back. The shower water took 30 minutes to get hot which I thought was ridiculous. Come to find out that MGM neglected to say that the pool was closed for the season which is suppose to be included in the $15 daily resort fee. We did dine out in the Emeril restaurant that did not meet on expectations like it did the first time we came here last year.  I was not impressed with the quality of the room and I vented my frustrations in the survey of my stay. I was credited the $15 resort fee but that does not change the fact of the complications of the room and the amount of money spent on this hotel. I like visting the MGM maybe for a fight but I dont think I will be staying here again!
Last month I stayed at the MGM and got a room in the west wing which was recently renovated. They did a great job!. . Check-in was pretty easy and Earl went to great lengths to try to move rooms around to accommodate my guests and I ensuring as best as he could to place our rooms as close to each other as possible. He also comped us tickets to Hakkasan Nightclub, which I asked for - so don't be shy, worst they could say is no.. . MGM offers a good selection of low end eateries to high end fine dining, which by the way is home to my favorite steakhouse: Craft Steakhouse. If you want to splurge, be sure to check it out! Also important, they do have a Starbucks centrally located on the casino floor in case you need that pick-me-up. There are also a few bars  (I really liked Centrifuge) located throughout the casino which makes a good escape to people watch and take a break from the casino floor (which by the way has a good variety of gaming selections).. . As for entertainment, you can dance the night away at Hakkasan Nightclub or watch Cirque's KA (I saw it a few years ago and admittedly it wasn't for me, but I really enjoyed O and Mystere).. . Our executive queen suite was amazing. I really liked the decor and fell in love with the living room. Some nights I was tempted to just stay in and watch TV, lol! The bed was very comfortable, temperature set was consistent and had good circulation, plenty of closet/storage space as well as electrical outlets to charge phones/laptops, etc., water pressure was great, and the entire room was clean. The desk space was also generous and the area by the huge window was spacious. I definitely recommend this room if you are planning to entertain a few guests prior to hitting the town.. . The only reason why I can't give it a full 5 stars is because their WIFI is terrible! Actually, it's just shit, shitty, shit. When I called to inquire about it they said at an additional $15 I could upgrade to "faster" WIFI, but the "increase" in speed would have barely made a dent. Luckily, I was able to use my phone as a hot spot and got some mandatory work done. If you don't have that option, you can always make your way to their business center, but I can't comment on whether or not it's sufficient as I didn't go myself.. . Check out was easy peazy through the TV and our bill was correct.. . All in all, I really like MGM Grand and will consider this as one of my go-to hotels, unless I want to splurge on something more upscale for a special occasion or if I hit the jackpot. And of course, booking earlier than later will always save you some money. To give you an idea on rates, we booked our room second week of November:. . Room Rates:. 1/16/2014: $94.50 (Thurs). 1/17/2014: $175.50 (Fri). 1/18/2014: $193.50  (Sat)
Tres tres chouette hotel pour sejourner a Vegas. Ideal car on y trouve tout !!. Que vous soyez piscine, jeux ou que vous vouliez un large choix niveau nourriture ou meme vous faire une fete de fou a l'Hakkasan, le MGM offre toutes ces possibilites.
Stayed in a penthouse suite during one of my recent visits. Of all the penthouse suites I've stayed at in Las Vegas, this is by far the quietest.. . Though this is only a guess, I believe that MGM staggers its penthouse assignments for as long as it can. That way you don't have people to the left and right or on top of each other until it's absolutely necessary. Regardless, whatever MGM is doing, I hope it continues. And this tip: when you get a penthouse suite, try to get a corner. Makes the experience even better. . . As for the rooms, they are spacious and nice. The amenities, accessories, etc., of the room, though, do not live up to what I expect from a true penthouse suite. The place that does have accessories and amenities that are penthouse quality is the Aria hotel. Top notch.. . Anyhow, if you're looking for a very nice penthouse to stay in, be sure to check out the MGM. . . The next time I stay at the MGM, meanwhile, I am getting a SkyLoft. Look for that review in the next couple of months.
I will be returing to the MGM for the 3rd time in May. I love the pool (The best in Vegas in my opinion) also like the variety of choices in the food court. Rooms are small but comfortable. The only negative is that I have always booked through a 3rd party (Orbitz, Spirit and Cheaptickets.com) and I am not crazy about the service I get when calling into the 800 number and trying to upgrade or stay an extra day, services which I am willing to pay extra for. Front desk help have been very helpful.
