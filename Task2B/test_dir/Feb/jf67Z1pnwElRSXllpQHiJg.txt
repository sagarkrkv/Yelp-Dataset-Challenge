I'm impressed thus far!!! As soon as I got off the plan I was greeted with slots.... I hope and pray I leave with what I came with.  The airport is fairly self-explanatory. After I retrieved my luggage, I could go left or right. Left was for a taxi and right is for the shuttle. I recommend the shuttle. It's cheaper and you get to interact with more people.
I was here for an hour and a half layover. I found this airport to be very clean, with good clear signage and adorable slot machines. It was really easy to navigate and I didn't have my usual "I'm going to miss my flight because I don't know where I'm going" layover panic. . . I liked this airport very much.
It's not like you really have a choice of another major airport coming in to Vegas, but McCarran's a good place. I fly out at least once a month, normally more, and TSA is normally pretty quick, effective, and clear. The new Terminal is a welcome addition, although a little sparse at the moment.. . Plus, I'm rarely delayed. We can thank the desert for that, but why not give McCarran some props?. . And free WiFi is a major plus.
LOL, I have a love/hate relationship with this airport. . . PROS. -Because there's so many tourists, vacation-ers, party-goers, the taxi drivers know how to get the job done by getting their passengers to and from the airport. This also goes for the people who work in the airport.. -I love how modern and "appeaaaling" it is to the tourist's eyes, hella trying to lure them into spending money! (Duh), lol.. . CONS. -Of course, because it isss Vegas, it WILL be busy, so expect to come right at the 2 hour mark before your flight so you aren't stuck in the long security line. Believe me, I've almost missed my flight before.. -The actually clerks can be bitches, which I can understand because they deal with annoying, drunk, hungover people everyday, but shiit, can a person get a little kindness! Lol.
You can gamble and pig out while waiting for your flight.  Enough said !!!!!!
Big airport..decent food options .. Easy to get to and from the strip can't complain one of the better airport to travel into in the United States
15 Bucks to the Strip. Can't beat that! Clean. Got a free pre-screen. JBLU's a big playah now! Don't have to shuttle to the cheap side now. As far as airports go, this is one of the cleaner ones.
Nice and clean airport, good food selections, and plenty of space inside. if party of 2 or less, suggest you take a shuttle instead of a taxi to your hotel- bell trans is only $13 round trip/ person and very nice.
This place is overcrowded, dingy, and old. At least the "C" terminal is... it looks like it was built for a time when Las Vegas got far fewer visitors, because it looks thrown together, with about every chain restaurant they could find. Nothing looks local at all.. . Stay away from the Sammy Hagar Beach Bar & Grill. Food was subpar, pico de gallo looked about 2 weeks old, and the lime on my Corona was brown - it's pretty clear they let their food sit out.
As soon as I landed my happy ass in Las Vegas, I couldn't help but shout VEGAS, VEGAS, VEGAS!!. . This airport is nothing special, but offers a bunch of randoms that most airports don't. . 1. Slot machines, to play while you wait....and loose money while you wait.. 2. All kinds of entertainment - music, live ads for shows and the like.. 3. Alcohol is offered right after you get off the plane. HOLLER!. . However, the security lines and baggage check were insanely long, food options aren't that great, and people all seem to be in an off mood.. . not the best, but not the worst.
Home sweet home!!. . Per Yelp, 4 stars = Yay! I'm a fan.. . That's exactly what I think of McCarran...I'm a fan.. . It's an airport...but there are some factors which make it better than most:. . 1 - not overly crowded. 2 - security lines are quite fast. 3 - convenient ticket printing kiosks. 4 - great shopping. 5 - SLOT MACHINES. . Oh, and VALET.. . TIP:  i love the valet...don't love the prices...but i love calling them when my plane lands to ask them to pull my car up.
Definitely a nicer airport compared to some of the other ones that I flew into. I used United when I flew in and out of this airport. . . Security was fine, and while you were waiting in line, they showed a hilarious clip of the Carrot Top making mistakes during the airport security screening, just to keep the passengers entertained.  . . They had nice, yet pricey shopping areas for you to look at, and slot machines if you ever had the need to gamble while you wait to board your flight. Oh, and let's not forget about the FREE WIFI!!. . A lot of the eating areas were really pricey, and the prices did not match the quality of the food items that were being sold. But then again, it's typical in the airports. We all have to eat prior to boarding or sometime during mid-flight, right?. . Overall, a very good airport, and if I ever fly back to Vegas again, I will look forward to landing here.. . Cheers!
get the slots out.. they only take your money and leave you with a sour taste for Vegas.  I had to hang out for 3 hours due to flight delay.  Watched people playing slots for hours and not one person ever won.   They only put money in, never seemed to take it out.  would love to know the pay out on the airport slots as i'm sure it's very low.
What a joke! I now remember why I stopped flying American Airlines. And the self serve kiosks are even worse. AA, if you want some advice, that would be to take them out and sell them as boat anchors.. . Second entry - well AA is living up to my original entry. I understand the weather is bad but come on, I looking at 4 delays (one was a full day) and two gate changes. And the only communication was the gate change. Now I'm looking at an 11:00 departure and at this point it wouldn't surprise me if I ended up sleeping on the floor. . . Over thirty years with United and although there were delays, at least they told you why. Sorry, American Airlines SUCK!
I do love my Reno airport.  It's easily accessible.  Parking is a breeze.  The folks working the counters are always helpful and friendly.  The security line is rarely busy, and TSA are nice.  They've done a lot of renovations in this place, and it has a nice feel.  If only they had better restaurants!
The airport in Las Vegas is definitely a reflection of the Las Vegas strip and all that it is famous for. Lingering stench of cigarette smoke, old lady perfume and the peculiar mixture of hopefulness and despair, which hangs heavy in the stale air.  . . Props to slot machines at every turn, the airport would do well to place the same, or even a fraction of the same, care in the shopping and restaurant choices. . . My least favorite experience upon arrival at this airport is the Disneylandesque length of the taxi queue.
Its new, its clean, its much less crowded then terminal one.. and. they have some good EATS.. relatively quick to get from gate to baggage claim. easy to find.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrZaSce7w6A&list=PL85F12CD79A4CF72A (youtube video). . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ZnpCNfarA&index=36&list=PLA8fY63qNlEtdE6Y3ZgDYj_Nz57VfuWFE (youtube video). . First thing you notice when you arrived at McCarran International Airport are the rows of slots machine. If you have any doubt about what Vegas is about, that image would put it to rest. Yes, Las Vegas is all about indoor smoking. Then you'll realize that you need to take a train, not to get out of the airport, but merely to another part of the airport. As a preview of your long lines into the buffets later that night, you will be packed with hundreds of travelers not know why they are packed in the same carriage with you. Enjoy the exotic cologne from the equally exotic man standing next to you, my friend, because that's not really his cologne you are smelling. Once you find your way to the exit, you will find service to the strip from taxi, shuttle or hotel limos, because public transportation is highly discouraged by the Vegas authority. It will also give you a taste of getting ripped off before you get actually get ripped off at the casinos. . On your way out, you will have to maze through an equally confusing airport security line. You may or may not be in the right line, people around you are walking by while you spend what seems like a life time stationary.  But once you got inside you feel a sense of accomplishment, like you've made it, one of the few chosen people who get to fly that day.. Other than the confusing logistics, the airport operation itself was rather smooth. I just think the airport have out grown it's capacity.
I seem to have good luck when traveling in and out of this airport.  Security lines are usually never very long and they move quickly! Before leaving on your flight, there are plenty of slot machines to keep you entertained.  I will say that I have won on several occasions! What a great way to start a vacation! . . From coffee to burritos to Burger King, there is something to munch on while you are waiting.  They even have the local Ethel M Chocolate store to browse and pick up a gift! . . Whether you are coming or going, the passenger flow seems to move efficiently.  The directional signs are frequent and make it easy to navigate your way.  Yep, it's one of my favorites!
McCarran Airport is like the Strip in a 15 minute walk. You could literally never leave the airport and experience all of the cliche things about Vegas: the weird souvenirs, alcoholic drinks and slot machines. They even got down the "fast food everywhere you look". . . Remember, if you are picking someone up from this airport, don't linger at the passenger pickup anywhere. Also, short term parking is free for the first 15 minutes. Watch the clock! Really. . . They are constantly updating this airport and things are pretty new. Food is usually always fresh. The place is as clean as it can get. The bathrooms could use a little work, however!!!!! . . On a scale from 1 to 10, McCarran would make an 8. There are definitely worse airports that you could be at, don't take this airport for granted just because of a single bad experience! . . But really, this airport is a pretty good one, those things aside. They have really good customer service as long as you have printed out your tickets in advance. Also, arrive 2 hours before your flight because lines can get long!!
Worst airport I've ever been to hands down. I travel the world and have been to 100+ to compare.  Only place that sucked nearly as bad was Atlanta but only because of the long walks.
I've come here a few times for layovers and it gets the job done. If you love the clinking of slot machines every 5 feet, this place is definitely for you! Ha, but really, in Vegas you'll be gambling from the moment you step off the plane straight into your hotel room so don't be surprised by these slot machines. . . The airport is one of the smaller ones but you do have the luxury of free WIFI while you're waiting! Always a bonus.
One of the best airports!  Clean and tons of restaurant options.. Sfo should learn from these guys!
Extremely efficient TSA staff almost border lining on rude but I fly 2-4 times a week and I love their expeditious no frills approach. Not 5 stars because there is no priority line.
As airports go, Mccarren isnt up to par on making flyers comfortable.  The free Wifi barely works and the baggage claim and passanger pickup is always a nightmare.  I do not traveloften, but i dread going to the airport because it really is that bad.
Recently, I flew to Vegas for the first time. Living in LA, I've only driven there. Maneuvering around the airport was fairly easy to navigate. When we reached baggage claim, where we arrived 20-30 minutes late, my friend's luggage was waiting near the info desk as a security precaution so it wouldn't get stolen. It was a nice surprise. . . Eventually, we made our way to where the shuttle buses and limos arrive so we could take the WAX bus (public transit). I appreciate that they even have that option opposed to being forced to take a cab.
Not the most aesthetically pleasing airport, but I did appreciate that the check-in and security was very efficient and the TSA agents were happy, smiling, and friendly even at 6AM. . . I went to the Jet Blue gates and was disappointed that there weren't any charging stations for electronic devices. At least they had free WiFi.
Pretty easy to navigate, the only real thing that sucks is the food. And that the slots don't let you win. :) But what slot in Vegas does?. . Other than that security was relatively painless and I've never had a problem flying out from here. There was a nice charging station near my gate.
If you're flying an airline that flies out of terminal 3 like United, you better give yourself an extra 20-30 minutes. The terminal 3 security line is far far far slower than terminal 1.
Love this airport. It is relatively clean, free wifi with plenty of charging stations, a huge duty free store, and lots of slot machines to play while you are waiting to jet off.. . Have yet to encounter a problem going through security which can be pretty intimidating and scary; some of the TSA employees can be pretty mean at some airports, they were all pretty nice here!. . Food options are A-OK, MOES, Burger King, Carls JR, and Starbucks are all examples of the food options available.
I like how terminal 3 is a lot newer and cleaner tan terminal 1. Security check and ticketing are also much faster. I took the tram to transfer to terminal 1 after getting through terminal 3. I also like how there were ads saying "what happens here stays here - just a friendly reminder" all around the airport LOL oh vegas :)
I have flown in/out of Vegas several times, this review is for a lay-over so I cant comment on Security. I did play the slot machines (hey I'm in Vegas!!) and did get dinenr to go from PeiWei.
10,000 people, about 6 power outlets... They need to look at Sacramento with an outlet and USB charger at pretty much every gate seat in the terminal.. . Food is bad, and expensive even for an airport.. . Basically dirty, especially the rest rooms.. . Maybe a few less slot machines and some more comfortable seating maybe?. . TSA tends to be quick, the only upside.  . . As I was waiting, an airport employee sat down next to me to chow on some seafood, fishy-smelling and nasty... From one of the nasty eateries... Dude, I know you live in a sand pile, but trust me, if it smells 'fishy' you don't want to be eating that. . . Awful place to be stuck when the flight is late.  Meal choices are also terrible.
great airport with free wifi !
Well it's Vegas and stepping off the plane you already know this airport is different.   Slot machines are available if you get really bored and want to lose money, or if you need to win back some of the money lost. Either way, the airport is huge. I'm surprised it's so clean considering all the traffic it receives.
1 step above LAX - blech. Super busy, not enough seating in terminals, and dirty. Pretty appropriate for Vegas ;) Learned a valuable lesson without loosing an arm luckily - the doors on the train WILL CLOSE even if there is a person walking through them.
