My husband & I stayed at The Aria for four nights in the Panoramic Corner Suite! It was perfect! Hot tub was amazing! Your view while in the hot tub is the beautiful Cosmopolitan. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept on! The location of the resort is perfect it is close to pretty much everything! Many great restaurant options! We had dinner and drinks at Javier's and it was very good! The staff very snotty but the food was great. The World buffet was delicious as well! I have to say this will be the only resort we stay at when we return to Vegas! Customer service is top notch!!
Went to Haze nightclub parked in North Valet.  Club very lame absolutely nothing to see or enjoy then to cap off my boring night when I arrived home discovered valet had lost half of my keys including my house key and office key. It had only been 15 minutes since I had left so I called Aria frantically (correct contact number also very difficult to find on my mobile like really) but after being told a supervisor world call me in ten minutes I had to call back after 20 minutes to be put on hold for ten minutes!  I'm furious and locked out of my house!!! I hang up John or Sean calls after five more minutes or so tells me to call security and lost & found blah blah blah before I lose my mind and scream why can't you just have radioed North Valet 30 minutes ago to find my keys?! Also the Aria sucks just go to the airport it's the same horrific service and atmosphere
The Aria was a pleasant surprise!  The staff was helpful and nice and the room was clean and nicely furnished.  The lobby and casino is nicely done, check out the floors and flower arrangements throughout; very classy!  There is a good choice of restaurants: especially loved Julian Serrano for tapas.  The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because of the internet access.  It is included in the resort fee and we had to keep signing on and it was spotty in the room.  They need to improve it, I've stayed in sister resorts and have never had an issue with the internet access and signal.
Everyone here has been super nice to us. We always hang out at our Local casino Red Rock, but their host Todd is such a rude, abusive guy that we accepted the kind in invitation to go to Aria... Having fun with George Harris and Nicole Maroe....
Very beautiful hotel. Super sleek and modern. The rooms are a bit small, but it has a very beautiful view of the strip. I've stayed here about 3 times already, and enjoy it every time. Extremely classy place to be.
Let me preface this by stating that I had a comped room. Not comped by the casino but earned through the facebook application called MyVegas. So, I didn't have to pay anything, not even resort fees for our two night stay.. . If there is anything I need to say here it is that the bed at Aria was the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in! I slept so well, and was so rested at the end of my stay here that I seriously thought about just buying a bed like that to take home with me. By the way, you can, and I did. SERIOUSLY!. . Anyhow, our stay was flawless, there are so many great restaurants in Vegas, many of them located right here at Aria! If you stay, definitely splurge with dinner at at least of of them, American Fish, Julian Serrano and Bar Masa are among my favorites.. . The location of Aria is wonderful, the casino floor is clean and the place is never too smokey, they have a nice pool area that is kept open year round which is a nice plus, especially on this trip when the weather was unseasonably warm. . . In fact, we loved it so much I am doing something I rarely do, I am paying for my next stay!
My boyfriend planned a surprise birthday trip for me- destination Vegas!!!!  I was not aware of where we were staying until we got into  the taxi at the airport. The  service we received from the  moment we arrived until we left was First Class.  My boyfriend advised the front desk that it was my birthday. A few hours later a little surprise arrived in our room. A plate with dessert and chocolate covered strawberries.  The following morning we were going downstairs to get our tour to The Grand Canyon. One of the employees was kind enough to escort us all the way to where the bus was going to pick us up. There was a maintenance worker in the area at the time. When he saw us heading towards the escalator he kindly told us to please come this way towards the elevator since the escalators were being worked on.. . The location of the property is also ideal. You can easily walk out to the strip going north or south with plenty to do. The Aria is by far one of the best experiences I have had in a hotel.
Tough call here, but I'm giving this place 2 stars because Vegas is supposed to be fun.  This place wasn't.  Long lines for food, one (1!!!) valet guy, no inexpensive food options (18 dollar sandwiches), and no blackjack tables for less than $50.00.  I get it if Aria is going for the Four Seasons crowd, maybe trying to out-wynn The Wynn, but when the casino flaunts every table has a minimum of 50 dollars (meanwhile some are empty), their own ARIA-only, not M-Life Only, but ARIA-only rules on touching cards for certain games, well then they aren't trying to be fun.  No free drinks in the SPORTS BOOK....WTF?!?!  They are trying to be obnoxious.  Maybe I should have figured it out when the two largest signs as you drive that street are for LV and Gucci.  Bellagio is fun, MGM a blast, even 'slumming it' at the Monte Carlo seems like more fun.  This isn't.  I think the new-ness is what pulls people in.  . . I was there during super bowl weekend (Seahawks/Broncos).  Decorated very well.  Rooms are great.  Very comfortable.  EXCELLENT BED, fantastic shower.  Great decorations, waterfall walls, clean carpets, ipad-like room controls...but that isn't enough.  That isn't NEARLY enough.  . . Its vegas and you have sooo many more options.  If you are over 60 and money isn't EVER an issue, then I would recommend it.
Came here for a convention. Really nice rooms, everything is automated... Lights, tv, curtains all open or turn on with a touch screen panel. Room service has been great. Restaurants have been very busy, long waits for breakfast and check in. Beautiful hotel next to an upscale mall.
Let me start of by saying, this is where you need to be if you want to see all of the strip. Located in the heart of the strip, going to other casino is like a walk in the park. Taking the monorail or taking a shortcut through the shopping center outside. This is my second stay here and it's by far the only place I would want to stay in Vegas. The restaurants from sage to the pizza. It's an all in one hotel and casino, let me not forget about the buffet. Look for that in a review for a few tips me and my friend found out. When booking use orbitz or another online service because with the hotel we got free 2 buffets each day we was there. Another perk is valet parking if you rented a car or visiting by driving. Valet parking is what you tip the driver, but be respectful on the amount you tip and you can spend more time inside with worrying about a parking spot. The hotel designs from outside to in are just so gorgeous, it will make you stop for a picture. Have fun and good luck in Vegas!
Had a group of 6 split a 2 br city-view penthouse suite. Room was amazing but I couldn't get checked in until 4:15pm. Their website lists a 3pm check in, but it's not guaranteed. The registration desk simply implied I need to wait but when I called the personal skysuites concierge, I was given a $50 food/beverage credit for the property. Besides that hiccup, the night went very well. The suite is great for partying and the showers are amazing. The double as a steam room. Could only get a late checkout to noon, but the previous guest was allowed 1pm. Not sure why they were special.
I'm so happy my boyfriend and I stayed at Aria on our recent mid-winter getaway!  We go to MGM Detroit a lot and wanted to try out a MGM-brand hotel in Vegas.  We booked through the MLife website, which gave a very nice discount.. . Check-in. We arrived in on a Wednesday around 5pm.  I was expecting to have to wait forever (around Chinese New Year), as many reviews indicated. But, there was no wait. Check in was just fine - the concierge wasn't super friendly though.  . . Room. It was very nice.  I loved the big closet area and the mountain view we had.  Kind of a long walk from the elevators, but nothing to really complain about.  Housekeeping was decent, except sometimes they didn't replace all of our towels or empty/clean our drinking glasses.. . Casino. Consistent with most of the other MGM casinos.  I saw lots of table games with $20 minimums, more than I saw at the Bellagio.  Cocktail waitresses came around frequently.  It wasn't super crowded when we there (even on the weekend) so it was easy to get on a table.  I'd say the crowd was mostly well off upper 20s, lower 30 year olds. It's a nice space, but we spent most of our time gambling elsewhere.. . Check out. Soooo easy. I just did it from my cell phone and a folio was sent to my email immediately.  Perfect.  Taxi area was well organized and the Aria staff were helpful.. . Unfortunately, we didn't get to check out any of Aria's bars or restaurants due to time constraints.  We both were sad to leave and can't wait to come back.  Aria's location is honestly perfect and I will most likely be staying here again!
I love, love, love Aria. The only place that I can say is my home away from home. Check in is easy and friendly. Beautiful Casino floor, security to get into rooms, and the most comfortable beds EVER! I mean, you're literally sleeping in a cloud! Rooms are nice and beautiful bathrooms. . . Great location! . . Cant wait to come back!
Oh my god I love the beauty of this hotel!! I can't tell you how beautiful it is unless you experienced it yourself. I did the 20 test and it worked one time. Also I thought I would lose money at this hotel because it was so fancy but I ended winning! Can't wait to go back! Thanks aria!!
i was there for a business convention.  i was presenting the next day.  people partying in the hall at 4a.m.  multiple calls to the front desk with no success. had to go to the front desk several times between 4-5am to change rooms to a quiet floor.  exhausted the next day during presentation.  front desk was unresponsive, unprofessional, and incompetent.
Luxury, ease, grace, and gambling. Yes, it is possible to find all of these elements under one roof in Vegas.. . Aria is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed at on the strip. It's centrally located, easy to navigate, and the rooms are UHHHHHMAAAAAAZING. Honestly, if I was restricted to highlighting onething I loved about our stay at Aria, it's the bathrooms in the rooms. Absolutely gorgeous. The shower/tub combo steam room makes me want to blow my savings and remodel my bathroom in a similar fashion. What a genius idea--make every room a semi-suite, and every guest feels like a king or queen. . . My main inspiration for writing this review, was the customer service we had from every single employee that we encountered. EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE. And I don't just mean great customer service. I mean that every single person was genuinely happy, inspired, and stoked to be a part of Aria. Our questions were answered effortlessly, we received a free room upgrade on Super Bowl weekend, and the Concierge was particularly cheeky and friendly.. . So fantastic. Don't even get me started on the Crystal shops. UGHHHH. Aria, you're the best. As soon as I find a sugar daddy, I'll be back. Meet me at the Sex and the City Slot machines and we'll make a night of it.. . (Edit: my four stars instead of five stars is based on the experience I had with their business partners, the Light Group. Haze Nightclub should be ashamed of how they run their business and as a seasoned clubber, I was horrified at how this club is operated. But that's another review. I feel bad for the concierge that got my earful of a complaint the next morning.)
Fancy hotel with comfortable beds & amazing pillows. Valet is free!
Overall, I found the Aria to be very nice. The trouble is, most of the hotels in Las Vegas are nice. The Aria isn't bad, but it isn't special either.. . THE GOOD:. . - Nice atmosphere, architecture, decor, etc. It helps that it's new, but it's also generally stylish (both in the rooms and in the casino). . - Convenient tram to the Bellagio, close access to a variety of stores, nice and large driveway makes coming and going easy.. . THE BAD:. . - The rooms have this ridiculous touch-screen control pad. It's absurd. Admittedly, there's an "ooh" factor when you walk into the room and everything turns on (all the lights, the TV, and the curtains are computer-controlled), but after trying to turn things on and off using the touchpad at 11pm when I'm dog tired, the shortcomings of this system are profound. It's a neat idea, but very poorly executed...old-fashioned switches and knobs are easy and effective.. . - The restaurants I tried were over-priced and the service is slow. The buffet was merely average, with a 10-30 minute wait for a table. The cafe was a long wait as well. The pizza joint was crazy expensive for what I got....The food is good, but nothing exceptional.. Certainly nothing worthy of the premium I paid.. . - The casino is small, and the sports book is a joke. If you like to bet sporting events - or just hang out in the sports book - you'll want to go somewhere else.. . - The rooms are nearly as expensive as much nicer hotels (like the Wynn or the Bellagio), but the overall experience is inferior to a hotel like the MGM or Hilton (which are similarly priced).. . Perhaps in time the Aria will find a niche, but right now it seems like a conglomeration of a lot of different concepts: Part casino, part exclusive resort, part affordable and family-oriented hotel. All of this compromise left me less than impressed.. . Still, if I can get a deal, I'd have no problem staying here again.
Really beautiful place- modern.  Check in was a bit of a nightmare but they did answer all our questions and print out my Zarkana tickets.  I do love the Colorado River sculpture made from recycled silver that's over the reception area.
Our most recent stay at Aria really blew us away.. . We received an upgrade to a corner suite, which really made our weekend. The corner suite is twice the size of the deluxe room, has 1.5 bathrooms (one toilet has a built in electronic bidet), a jet tub, dual vanity sinks, three flat screen TVs, and a separate mini-bar/living space. We ended up spending a lot of time in the suite, and appreciated all the details.. . Service was impeccable, from the front desk to housekeeping. There's so much to do at Aria/Cosmopolitan that we didn't need to stray too far to find quality eats and entertainment. We came back from lunch to chocolate covered strawberries delivered in our room. We came back from dinner to find that they had cleaned and restocked the suite again (who cleans a room twice! amazing), placed chocolates and slippers out, and dimmed the lighting for us. It really felt like a personalized experience and outside of the long-ish walk to the corner suites from the elevator (not that we're complaining), everything was absolutely perfect. Aria is def. our go-to hotel from now on!
It was pretty busy since we stayed there for Valentines Day. . . Pros: . Pretty close to everything so we could walk pretty much everywhere without being in the true hub hub of things. . Room service was awesome (service and food). . Housekeeping was good (I broke some glass in the bathroom and they came to the room very quickly and had allequipment necessary). . The gym layout and equipment is awesome. . The Steak house is really good and the service was awesome!!. Awesome charge stations for all electronics. . . Cons:. . Walls are pretty thin, so we could hear EVERYTHING ... it was pretty bad and it was all night. . Depending on who answers the phone, the concierge can be a little smug (About 80% of the time). . Room Service is SUPER EXPENSIVE and there are a lot of hidden prices in the service.. . The trainer in the gym is not friendly, is unwelcoming, and unhelpful . . Part of the floor is linoleum (or something) and I slipped multiple times on it-- BE CAREFUL!!! . . Everything is on Control 4 which could be cool, if there were some sort of tutorial . . All the information on the hotel (room service menu, spa services, restaurants, etc) were all haphazardly put into a binder. Some information was missing, other pages were repeated, others were just disorganized (like food pages in the amenities section)-- when we told concierge they smugly said, "That's too bad" and made no offer to remedy it. . . Overall I wouldn't be bummed to stay here again but I'd like to stay somewhere nicer. There are a ton on the strip that are nicer for the same "5 star" price.
Nice hotel.  High tech rooms.  Loved the electronic blinds.  . . Not much else to say.  I honestly prefer The Venetian or Ceasar's, but thats only because I like the theme places in Vegas, but if you're looking for a nice hotel with the BEST location on the strip, the Aria fits the bill.
I genuinely enjoyed my stay at aria during past trip to las vegas. . It definitely has less smoke compared to other hotels, and as a non smoker,. It was great to get a little bit of fresh air here and there.. . I liked how the rooms looked modern as well. They had additional hotel resort fee, but i had a good use of wireless internet and gym facilities, I did not mind. I went in feburary, so we didnt get to use to pool are, but looking out from the gym, it looked awesome as sell. ( Like any other hotels in vegas, they charge couple nox for small bottle of water in room, but once you go to the gym, they hand you free water, apples, bananas,towels,etc- all included in resort fee, so take advantage!). . Personally, What i loved the most about aria was its location, it was near to mgm or cosmopolitan, but also walkable distance to ph, venetian, paris, bellagio,etc. . . In the resort itself, it had tons of gourmet restaurant options to choose from and had a great service. . . We went to the spa on our last day after checkout, and stored the bag. After couple hours, we realized i have left my curling iron in the room, and concierge was more than happy to contact housekeeping and lost and found for us.
Great location, luxurious, classy.. . The in-room controls are from a tablet, which is really cool, except that it doesn't always work well.
Love this hotel! From the time I checked in to the time I checked out I received nothing but excellent customer service! Had. Chance to hang out in one of the lounges and it had a cozy and relaxing vibe. . . The suite was amazing! The bathroom had a a huge deep soaking tub and I think I laidin. It for about an hour! The bed was super soft and I fell right asleep as soon as I laid down! I will definitely stay there again.
Stayed in the penthouse suite (SkySuites). Very nice stay.. . Pros: clean, well appointed two-bedroom penthouse suite (about 2100 sq. ft.). Really nice amenities. Loved the Toto Washlet toilet. . . Limo service from and to airport.. . VIP entrance makes your arrival nice and quiet. There is also a VIP lounge. Also nice. Additionally, any time we left the hotel we always returned through the VIP entrance. The service staff was always attentive through that side of the hotel.. . Loved the proximity to the Cosmopolitan, which is where Milos (the restaurant) is located. A walk bridge connects the Aria and Cosmopolitan. Milos is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas (see my review of it).. . My favorite pizza joint, Five50, is located inside the Aria. Nice bonus. . . Cons: the service staff was in our suite entirely too much. Between regular maid service, turndown service, and room service clearing, these guys always seemed to be around. This tip: decline the turndown service, so that the staff isn't showing up at your room at 10 pm.. . Noise on night two was unexpected. Got woke up at 4:45 am by people above us or to the side of us. We were on floor 35, so there are two floors above us. I'm not used to having noisy neighbors when I stay in penthouses. (The MGM penthouses are top dawg when it comes to noise control. I think they stagger guests for as long as they can. Additionally, corner penthouses at MGM are perfect.). . Anyhow, we had a great stay at the Aria. Even though I didn't think this was a five-star stay, I do believe that Aria will deliver a five-star experience next time we stay here.
great hotel location and nice rooms. the room service is crazy though...  $45.00 for breakfast....   lots of great food and the casino is very upscale. I would stay here again but starbucks is best option for a quick bite in the AM
Grossly understaffed.   Had one guy working the invited guests window.   For a Saturday during a "fully booked". Night this is unbelievable.   Booked for a Saturday night and came for check in at 3.   Waited 4 to 5 hours to finally get a room with my while day gone which defeated the whole purpose of me checking in the first place.. . Not the staffs fault but management needs to get a clue and not try and skimp on payroll and be appropriately staffed. . Oh and one other thing.   When the "privacy" light is on outside the room it means privacy please!!!   Not knock and open the door and ask of we need towel service.   This is pretty self explanatory and no other hotel I've stayed at barges in on your privacy like this.   Thought it was a random mistake but as I walked down the hall i saw multiple house keepers knocking on doors that said privacy.   Privacy means privacy please!!
This is by far one of the best hotels that I have stayed at. We stayed here during December and I don't know why it has taken me this long to review the hotel. . . Here's a lots if why I like this hotel compared to alllll the other hotel one can choose when visiting Las Vegas. . . 1. Very nice elegant and modern architecture. Our room was very nice and decorated to perfection. Our view was priceless and the best part of it was that it was about 220 a night. Our stay was during middle of December. . . 2. The location. It's centralized within the strip and it's a easy walk to the surrounding hotels, shops and  restaurants. There is also a tram that one can take to get around. We just walked everywhere because it was  so convenient. . . 3. The restaurants. Specifically the Buffett. I used to think that Wynn had the best Buffett. But that is until I tried Aria buffet. I believe it was about $40 for dinner or $45 for dinner per person. But not was it worth every penny. The variety of food was endless and the quality was unbeatable. . . I loved everything about this hotel and I truly recommend it to anyone a traveling through Vegas. The off season prices make it affordable. So try it of you can because it's truly worth it.
Where to begin?!. .  My boyfriend set this up for Valentine's day and this hotel came highly rated. We were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this hotel and its "customer service".. . Upon arriving, we were suppose to have a king size bed, guaranteed, we ended up with 2 queens. We were suppose to have a dozen red roses and chocolate covered strawberries delivered upon arrival. That did not happen, and when they did finally deliver, the strawberries were already going bad! The TV remote didn't work, the fancy ipad type room control didn't work, the AC wasn't working. After we called down - we were credited $75 dollars for our inconvenience.... for the cost of that hotel, $75 was like a $5 credit anywhere else.. . The next day we went to the spa and that was not bad. I have been to a few spas and that one was decent. Except, my facial lady was trying to be cute, I guess, but instead was offensive. Went back to the room to find it cleaned, and our liquor bottles rearranged and all. The cleaning person put my bottle of rum (with a wood cork top) under the 100 watt table lamp and it started to burn the cork. As I removed it from under the lamp and tried to remove the cork before it exploded from the heat, it burned my hand so badly, that it ruined the night! They sent over security who assured me someone would call and take care of my issues - it is 2 weeks later, and that hasn't happened yet! Called down again to the front desk and they said for my burn and inconvenience, they would issue a $50 credit. 50!!! Seriously?!?! We called to say we may be late for our romantic Valentine dinner at the Jean George, because I am working around a burned hand, and they said they would not be able to hold our RSVP and we would lose our table. We then went to dinner, on time, and in EXTREME pain, at the Jean George steakhouse I had walked the rest of the casino with NO issues, but immediately entering the restaurant, I felt on the floor because it was SUPER SUPER slippery!  I was trying to be EXTRA careful - I still fell IN THE MIDDLE of the $%#&$ restaurant! The waiter came to our table and made a joke of my fall immediately and said "careful the floor is slippery" then the what I assume is the manager, came and asked if I was OK. Didn't offer any help, or  food or drink or anything. The restaurant Jean George - was OK. We go to a lot of steak houses and this one is WAY over priced. We ordered one wagyu steak (15oz) shared by us 2 and 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine came out to $400. REALLY?! Though the lobster mashed potatoes were SO GOOD!. . I was going to say something but why?! For another $50 or &75 crappy credit? When we spent well over $2000 that weekend? NEVER going back to that hotel EVER. To pay that kind of money for crappy service! The Sahara has better service! The Luxor well surpassed the room and spa expectations. And those are OLD casinos.. . Just to be clear - we do NOT need anything to be given or handed to us for free but it is the principle that matters here.
This is a really cool hotel.  The only cons I would like to point out is that...the technology in the rooms is almost novelty rather than useful.  Had a hell of a time getting the music to play through the TV.  The ipad things are sometimes unreliable (probably because they aren't actually ipads but some sort of knockoff)  Other than that the rooms are very nice...and on the more expensive end of things.
Modern hotel without the pretentious atmosphere that you would find at the Wynn or the Palazzo. The technology within the rooms take time to get used to but overall was an ok choice for my wife and I.. . The things that keep the Aria from the extra stars is due a host of problems. When my wife and I returned from dinner, our room was filled with marijuana. I called security and they said it must've come from the vents. Not that I have a problem with MJ but for my room to be filled with smoke is not ok. Granted they moved me to another room but all I got out of being inconvenienced and a headache was a $50 room credit. Really? My wife got dizzy and coughed for 20 minutes. If you've got a pair of jugs and know how to flirt the manager will give you a suite and comp the room yet we get a 50 room credit for our troubles? It's like big brother telling us to move along.. . The curtains in our "new" room worked half the time and had to press it multiple times to get it to close. Lastly, every single time, and I want to reiterate, every single time, that I pressed the button to the elevator orwaving the key card to my room, I would get static shocked! WTF? It's like the Aria just wanted to torture me. . . Aside from that my birthday at the Aria was a mixed bag and for someone that goes to vegas 3x a year, I don't know if I will stay here again.
Grand vision, architecture, style, and scope... nice. Might like to stay here with an aspiring starlet after I sell my screenplay, heh.  In the meantime I'm northbound up the Strip, cause they have PURPLE backgrounds on the gaming tables, which ought to only, ever be the classic deep green colored felt!  Minus one star for purple tables.
I LOVED ARIA. . Let me start by saying that I love their decoration of the room. It's super modern and clean. I'm someone who puts a huge emphasis to the bathroom and boy this hotel has a nice bathroom. I love how the tub and the shower is together with dim lighting if you wanted it to be that way. I thought it was romantic. . . But more than the room it was the service that got me sold. . I lost something super valuable that night and I called the lost and found. They were very helpful in trying to aid me with finding it back and what I could do on my side. . I told them where I think I may have possibly lost the item and to my surprise they gave me a call back in less than 20 minutes telling me that they have found the item. . In such a large hotel I think this is some STELLAR SERVICE. . . Thank you Aria for making my possibly bad-day to an enjoyable fun night.
I'm not sure how many times I've been at Aria now, I think four or five but it still remains my favorite hotel.  I love the rooms; it's spacious, comfy, great lighting and it feels clean.  I wasn't too thrilled to see a hair in the bathtub or my wife's bed side lamp not working (light bulb was out).  However, the automatic curtains, the tablet to control everything in the room is excellent.  I will say I don't like the way the restaurants are laid out in the hotel.  But all in all, I like this hotel and I would definitely come back and stay here again.
Great place to sleep while on vacation, soft pillows and beds. The bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time. The food options you have at the ARIA are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat.
