I love this place!!!!  One of my favorites in the Phoenix metro area.  I mainly go here for the Bruschetta on Mon and Tues nights after 8pm for their $20 wine bottle and bruschetta board (feeds 2).  Favorite Bruschetta:  1 - Salmon, 2- Apple and Brie with Fig Jam, 3- Prosciutto, fig, and marscapone, 4- White Bean.  Honestly, I could eat there every single day.
Awesome topping combo's on the Bruschetta board and panini's are killer!
Very efficient and friendly staff, good wine selection, bruschetta and cheese plate are great!
Me and my wife LOVE this place! Great staff and great food. Atmosphere is fun!
This is the ideal place to go for a relaxing glass of wine & some food without the stuffiness. Great wine, great food, great atmosphere & great staff. What else is could you want ?! :)
Great food and drink! Great atmosphere! To die for Bruschetta and fantastic specials throughout the week. I only wish the restaurant was bigger to accommodate more people as it is not uncommon to have to wait quite a while for a table and there is really no where to sit or really even stand while you wait. However, the staff is great at getting you a drink while you wait either at the bar or if you're lucky enough to get a spot at one of their standing room only tables.
Very yummy! I love the bruschetta (of course). The music & atmosphere are always great, love this place! Not so fond of the valet, but whatever.
Romantic and great food
Love this little neighborhood and wish other places in the valley could replicate the character as well as the great food and wine list.  . . Bottle and a board of bruschetta on Monday and Tuesday nights along with a reservation for a party of 8? I think I'll get my gang together!  But I also love the open garage doors and the little patio!  Follow up with a walk through the LGO grocery and bakery and get yourself an MJ for dessert.  Perfect evening with friends!
I love this place. It's hip trendy and fun. The crowd is always fun to watch and I especially love love the olive canoe. It's my favorite. We had some great wine and great company and everyone I take to Postinos seems to really like it.
Very classy. And a classic.. Not for a big dinner or a party over 10. . Small group, small bites, share a bottle, maybe a cheese board; a guaranteed good time.. . They have beer too. Great beer.
Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.. Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. . We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!
awesome place and great crowd
I don't know why it took me so long to get here, but it was truly one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.  Shared the bruschetta with my bestie, then we each got the half sandwich and salad - I absolutely can't wait to go back.
Great food and ambiance. Postino Central will always be my favorite location.
The bruschetta was good as always, but the artichoke and bean dips were blah and the bread was hard enough to tear up my mouth. We asked for softer French bread they say sure and brought us 3 slices! When asked for more they brought us a bowl of the hard stuff, it was quite frustrating since the service overall was bad for us. We had a server who left right after taking our initial drink order and no new server took us on. We had to flag someone new every time we needed or wanted something since no one came to check on us and that was including our food order.  I plan to stick to the one in central from now on. I've always had excellent service there.
love the atmosphere, the wine, and the bruschetta! great girls night/ day spot!
Everything was phenomenal about this place except the wait time.
Love this place! Happy hour is great and extremely reasonable prices
Not as great as the hype. Bruscetta was okay. We got the white bean and tomato, smoked salmon, brie and apple, and artichoke spread. The artichoke was great and the others were okay but nothing special. Also had soup of the day, which was flavorful, mozzarella cheese and tomato salad, which had a great basil olive oil.. The service was not good. Our waitress was aloof and barely waited for us to speak before she was walking away. Our appetizers came out with the main dish and took longer than what seemed necessary given the number of customers and what we ordered.. Ambience is good...light and airy. Good for small groups and dates but not kids as its a wine bar...
Food is good for what they offer, wish they had more to choose from other than bruchetta, salads and sandwitches. I think that's a good menu for lunch, but if you dine there for dinner they should have a few entrees to choose from like a pasta dish or something more flavorful. When you eat sandwitches at dinner it just feels wrong, especially if you just have time for a dinner date. However what keeps people coming is the dim hip atmoshere, the open layout, the wine and the twinkle lighted patio. Parking is a bitch, so bring cash for the Valet.
I really enjoy their bruchetta. Their brunch is really good and the mimosas are tasty.
Yum. Can't beat the Monday/Tuesday special. Their bruschetta is mind-blowing! Parking is rough, but the complimentary Valet are always friendly. Definitely worth the crowd!
