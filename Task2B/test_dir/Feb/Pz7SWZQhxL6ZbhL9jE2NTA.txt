5 star service. We must have had about 5 people waiting on us at all time. RANDY was the best server I have had in a very long time. TOP NOTCH. The $69 filet is worth every penny. The bison was delicious and I love the server who helped us order a bottle of wine. I'd go back in a heartbeat! It is absolutely beautiful inside! Loved sitting in the lounge after dinner.
Four stars because of the view... the music not so much.  With a good DJ and sound system upgrade this could be a great place. I visit here all the time, but just for the view
If its your first or 5th time in Vegas, this is a MUST! The view is amazing! Great place to relax over drinks after a long day and unwind with some good music!
My latest visit to Mix was quite the disappointment.  I had dined there once before over a year ago and recalled a much better dining experience.  If you are here for the food, you have made a mistake.  There are so many places in LV to go for an amazing gastronomic experience, that Mix doesn't even begin to contemplate playing in that ballpark (though they may be fronting like they do by serving hoity-toity dishes like foie gras with chicken terrine.) However, it's more than just what you're serving, it really comes down to how it tastes.  Our party of four tried several different options and none commanded anything but average reviews, and some were even worse than that.  My ribeye, which our waiter assured was "excellent," was not.  It would have been excellent if I ordered it at Denny's or Sizzler with some eggs, but it wasn't excellent at some ritzy LV restaurant.  I didn't even care to finish it.  And I always care to finish a good cut of meat.  It tasted like a supermarket bought steak, prepared clumsily at home.  That's how good it was.  The foie gras was horrible, neither it's taste, appearance or texture were appetizing.  My husband ordered scallops.  Again, okay if they were from a buffet.  They were out of the cod entree, which is what I remembered enjoying on my previous visit.  Our meal was so un-spectacular that I can barely recall the other appetizers we ordered or the dessert.  Our server was a tad curt and unavailable and not forthcoming with recommendations or suggestions.  In all, we regret having wasted our one night out in LV at Mix. The view is nice, but not nearly enough to redeem the poor quality and taste of dinner.  We were so hungry after the Michael Jackson Cirque show downstairs that we ignored our better judgment that was telling us to eat at SW instead.  Sorry Mix, we won't be coming back.
Let's be honest... Your paying for the atmosphere and view. The food was GOOD, not great. The service was very tentative, and extremely knowledgable. I tried the steak and Mac n cheese for a side. The steak wasn't worth the price, my child makes better Mac n cheese. However, it's Vegas and everything is expensive. Overall a good experience, but I'll try something new next time.
The view here was amazingggg. Located on top of The Hotel by Mandalay Bay, you can see all the lights from below. Make sure you take atrip to the bathroom. On the way walking there, they have a patio where you can walk out and see the huge sign that sparkles and says "THEHotel" it's quite an amazing view with so many lights. The bathroom has a gold tinted window. Great place to take bathroom pictures for girls. . . Food wise, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly. Must try the foie gras steak item on their menu.
Yowza.. . Had my dinner in here on our wedding day and it was indeed fine enough for such an occasion. The service was immense.. . Quality food from a diverse menu with stellar service and an amazing drinks list. Very cool vibe with relaxed music (never heard Radiohead's 'Treefingers' before ANYWHERE).. . We were treated to an unexpected free dessert which was a pleasant surprise, and it helped round off our satisfaction with the choice of restaurant on the big day.. . The real treat was the view, where you basically look over the Luxor and MGM Grand facing north on the strip. Amazing.. . Mega recommended.
Me: Hey babe, guess where we are going tonight?. Her: Where?. me: Mix.. Her: Date night, say whaaaaaat?!?. . Boom, instant brownie points.. . We both have mutual friends that swear by this place, and for good reason. The food was delicious and *cliche description everybody gives* the view was amazing.. . The service wasn't anything too bad, but I did notice that it took a while for our food to arrive. Luckily, I enjoyed the conversation I was having with my lady.. . My only real turn off at miX is how close the tables are to each other. There is so much space in the restaurant not being used, why cram everybody in together? . . miX gets 4 stars.. .  As for the guy at the table to my right that I was forced to have dinner with, I wish I could find his yelp page and give him 1 star for the irritatingly loud ringtone of a cricket that he seemed not to hear every 2 minutes.
Aesthetically pleasing dining room. Felt like a restaurant I would see in Miami . I love the seating in the pods. Good food , good service . Thank you Sebastian for taking care of us.
WOW. What an experience. Really fantastic dinner.. . The view alone is worth the trip.. . But everything else is above & beyond as well: ambiance, service, presentation & food. Absolutely superb. . . We got the wine pairing with each of our meals which I would highly recommend. . . Hats off to Alain Ducasse, the chef & to the management team. Very well done. Thank you for the experience.
Very cool, modern feel to this restaurant and bar.  The view from the patio is outstanding as many others have noted.  . . I found the service at the bar to be at bit slow, particularly since they weren't that busy at the time I was there and two bartenders were working.  . . But if you have a chance to go, definitely do it, you'll enjoy the view if nothing else.
The Best View in the City.  Must request an outdoor table (they have heaters).  You overlook the whole strip (since Manalay Bay is at the very end), we even saw the moon rise ov er the mountains.  The wait staff is extremely attentive and courteous.  It's pricey, but everything we ordered from the Waygu to the Strip Steak was wonderful and perfectly prepared.  The atmoshere is modern and elegant, and you pass through the MIX nightclub to get there (another great place to hang).  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant.
I'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and I had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Mix.  On one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a Saturday evening in Vegas for a seven hour event.  . . So, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  Edit: looks like I have to trim my review, I hit the 5000 character limit. :-(. . 1) Ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate Mix.  There is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  The interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.. . The main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  If you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  If you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  I recommend after dark for balcony seating.. . 2) Service - I've never had a bad experience at Mix.  My wife and I visited Vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at Mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  We did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  Drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.. . We've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  I'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.. . 3) Special requests.  They've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  For example, on our first anniversary when we went back, I arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to Mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  The restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  If you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.. . 4) FOOD!  Okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  Here's what we've had and when:. . a) The pepper crusted bison tenderloin, cod brandade and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  The bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  On the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.. . b) Surf & turf.  Although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  My wife gets this religiously and loves it.  I will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from N9NE at the Palms.  There's regular surf & turf, then there's Mix's surf & turf, then there's the N9NE surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.. . c) Filet mignon rossini with foie gras & black truffle sauce.  If you're into truffles, I'm sure you'll love this.  The steak comes out perfectly.  I'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  Perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.. . d) Roasted maine lobster "au curry".  I love spicy, I love Indian food, I love this meal.  It's my go-to Mix meal; I get it every time once I tried it.  It's perfect combo of everything I love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.. . Don't forget to go visit the Mix Lounge next door after dinner!  Great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).
I am just going to go with that perhaps I went on a bad night.  We are in Vegas visiting for a girls trip and after a few recommendations, we decided to roll over to Mix for a little hanging on our Friday night in Vegas.  . We got here pretty late thinking it would be really poppin' by this time.  There were a decent amount of people there but not packed by any means.  . . Hit the bar up first to grab a cocktail before we walked to check out the scene and the spectacular view.. This is when things just seemed really off. . . There appeared to be 1 bartender and then after hanging around for about 5 mins, another bartender surfaced but neither seemed to know what was going on or where their spirits were to make the requested cocktails by anyone. . . Once we finally got to put our drink order in, the guy had to run to the other end of the bar to grab the needed items.  On top of that, he had sweat dripping from his head.  Really?  . . I don't want to go on and on talking about how much I didn't enjoy this place but I just can't seem to understand how this place has so many great reviews.  . . View - pretty spectacular, but small area.  Not good sound for those wanting to hang out outside.  . . Music - started with a good mix of old school hip hop and then just went sideways.  . . Bar - left lots to be desired. . . Crowd - very varied, not a good mix. . . Vibe - has potential but appears to not be the "hot" spot anymore.  . . So for this review, 2 stars because "meh, definitely have experienced better."
Chefs tasting menu...  It was good, everything was cooked just right, but didn't excite me as much as it should've.  . . I did enjoyed it all, so it is definitely a hard 4 stars.  I would guess more like 4.6.  . . Well, next time I'll just go for he surf & turf.
Really? This place is such a dated, throwback to 2003. The food is dated, the decor is dated- red and white pleather? They keep the lights really low so you can't see how dingy everything is.  The waiter kept bragging about all the celeb couples who have been there- Brad and Jennifer, JLO and Ben Affleck- and I'm thinking "how long ago was that?"  Is that the last time this place was "cool'?  This is NOT fine dining.  Guy Savoy is fine dining.  Joel Robuchon is fine dining. Just sayin'...
Amazing views of Las Vegas from our outside dining location! Favorite items ordered: tuna tartare and the scallop entree. Great service!
