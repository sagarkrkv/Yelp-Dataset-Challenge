In sum, never be back again. Unless you just want a cheap place on strip, and don't care about anything else, go for it.. . Pro: cheap room, Sunday 58per night + 28 resort fee per room similar as elsewhere.. Room is not big but clean and okay.. Cons:. 1. Heavy Smokey casino, . 2. No coffee maker, want hotwater for drink? Pay for it.. 3.super bad attitude of service department, when I called them about the drinking hotwater, they treat me super rude, "do you have hotpot to make hot water?" "No we don't have any available now." "How about ?....." Beep beep .... They cut off the phone!?! . 4. Don't care about customer complain, ask for supervisor, frond desk will transfer you quickly to a line, so called "supervisor", and well, you will never get chance to speaks with a human, all you got is a voicemai box and manager never return back call
Getting a suite isn't too bad. It's big, but a few of the other times I went, I was met with an awful experience. My friends and I stayed here for a night and I've stayed here beforeand it was pretty nice, but this trip was not so great. When we first came to the room, it was freezing cold so we turned on the heater. About 10 minutes later, we smelled something burning. At first we thought it was the iron, but it wasn't even plugged in, then we followed the smell to the heater and tried to turn it off, where my friend then got slightly electrocuted. When we came back from our night out, we got the bedding ready to sleep, but when we flipped out comforter, there was a blood stain crusted on our sheets. I immediately called in for a change of bedding. Despite how disgusting it was, they did manage to bring me a different blanket in a timely manner.
My husband and I visited Las vegas in Dec, 2013. While looking for hotels to stay at, we liked TI coz it was placed on the strip and had relatively good reviews in all the sites with affordable prices. We reached there by 11.30 AM and were wondering whether we had to wait till 3 PM for checkin. Luckily, they were allowing early check in that day. We had our meals in pho ca dao and bfast at the coffee shop. The casino was nice and not overcrowded. It was lively and exciting but not too overwhelming and congested. The self park behind the hotel gets full easily so make sure you reach early to get a parking spot. The only time we needed the car was when we went to Circus circus, Stratosphere and the Mob museum. It is centrally placed and considerably safe.. . We were given buffet passes for lunch in a weekday. The buffet had several cuisines. The taste was ok. Can't complain as it was free!. . I have reduced a single star bcoz the carpets were quiet stained and the hotel gave a kind of smokey dingy smell. Just a little bit but it was very obvious when we first came in... Got used to it in a day though!
As far as hotels go, TI is pretty swell. The casino isn't huge, but it seemed to treat us favorably. Room service was quick and the the rooms are great. Called room service one morning for extra towels and they were there within 5 minutes. Beds are comfortable, with enough pillows. Bathrooms are spacious. TV has some basic offerings.. But extra channels, Wifi and amenities are pretty expensive (probably on par with other hotels in Vegas). . Overall a great hotel for the rate.
I was very disappointed with my stay at TI. I took my a large part and rented three rooms for two nights. I had what appeared to be a decent deal through hotels.com. The rooms came with a free buffet for two and were at a comparable rate. At the front desk, I was charged an additional resort fee for $56 dollars a room thus effectively negating the good deal. I was also advised that of the three rooms there was only one non-smoking available, this was at 6pm. With the $56 two day mandatory resort fee, we had the privilege of using the fitness room, using WIFI but only 1 device per room, and daily paper which you had to go to the lobby to pick-up.. . The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was a small refrigerator and a small safe for personal items. . . I brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate my daughter's twenty-first birthday. I called the front desk to get an ice bucket, there was none in the room, they gladly would bring one up for $5.41. If we wanted Champagne glasses would be an additional $5.41 for 2. . . I was getting slightly annoyed with all the nickle and dime charges for normal services. . . In the morning, I searched for a coffee maker and found none, not included. . . I tried the fitness room. There was a complete gym. The machines were well maintained. They had a nice variety of nautilus machines, cable systems and free weights. There were plenty of cardio machines. . . The free buffets which were included were for lunch 11-1 on weekdays. They offered a two for one special in exchange. They come with an all you can drink addition of $12. All you can drink was limited to Budweiser and cheap wine. After hearing feedback from my children on the buffet, I decided to pay full price for a meal elsewhere.. . Next time, I will investigate my choices a little more. I will be staying at another hotel on my next visit to Vegas.
Last time I stay here.... Best part is tram to Mirage a much better hang out spot. Frog bar and venue not working for me... And all restaurant prices way too high! Kind of rip off.... There idea of happy hour is a joke no deals on food at all! . But it's Great if you are an alcoholic...
I was pleasantly surprised by my stay at Treasure Island. It was centrally located on the strip, close to shopping and other hotel/casinos. The pricing for the rooms was great, although they do get you with the $20 resort fee if you're not planning on taking advantage of the coupons and amenities.. . The one major issue I had was with the hotel check-in. We checked it at 4:30 on a Monday and the line was literally 30 - 40 people long. It took over half an hour to check in, and after working a full day, the last thing I wanted to do was wait in a Disneyland-sized line. We had thought it was a computer issue, but when we got to the front we were told that it's usually that busy.. . The Breeze Bar is a good place to get some drinks, but if you're looking for good wine, the Italian restaurant is where you really want to go. The menu for the Breeze Bar says you can ask for a larger wine selection menu, but they didn't have one. So that was a little weird.. . The rooms were much nicer than expected. The bed was comfortable, and I want those pillows for my house. They're full and comfortable, with not too much give. The blinds blocked out all of the light from the strip (super important!) and everything looked well-maintained.. . One weird thing was that my friend opened a drawer to put her clothes away and found a full drawer of someone else's clothes in there. I think housekeeping usually checks drawers at other hotels when cleaning, so may have just been an oversight.. . All in all, I had a good experience and would not mind staying here again.
Treasure Island (TI) rocked it...made my trip much nicer this past week.  There were tons of conferences that caused strip hotel costs to spike, but Treasure Island stayed reasonable.  . . What's cool:. . Katrina was kind enough to give me and my guest (who stayed in another room) a free upgrade.. . Got the free buffets (didn't use them, but will keep them for future use if I can). . HUGE suite.  4 out of 5. Comfortable, nice...and again...huge!. . What could improve:. . Gym/Fitness Center: Tell me where it is, and have a sign on that floor. The spa is not a fitness center.  I would not look for a gym in a spa.  So it would have been nice to have a sign directing me to the fitness center in the same area as the spa.
Won't stay here again.. . Its clean and staff is nice.. . The restaurant staff stopped caring about their paying guests.  Its order.then here's your food and your check. They never follow or ask hows your food nothing.. . The beds are hard!!. . I've paid the less and felt like I got my moneys worth.. . But not here.
Well then.. I remember when I was a kid this place was very tacky, tourist-y, and pirate-y. It was so very themed and so very Vegas. That pirate show was my everything. I miss that Treasure Island. . . Anyways, this hotel is a piece of shit now. They are under some ownership and call themselves TI or something, trying to be all swank. . A friend of a friend was staying here in a suite so after the club we went to hang out and party some more. . . For a "suite" I would have to say that this was NOT impressive. It was very dated and actually very small. Their "strip view" was really lame because the window was SOOO tinty! Also, dumbshits only booked one King bed. HAHAHA! So, it got later, shit got weird, I was sobering up so I decided to go have a smoke downstairs in the casino. I told my friend I was taking his room key and going downstairs to have a cigarette or two. . . I go downstairs by myself and go into the dead ass casino. It was probably like 3am. It was depressing. I was gonna play slots but I remember how tight the slots in Vegas are  so I  just sat down and lit up a cig. While chilling, I was approached by a man in cargo pants. He worked for hotel security. He proceeded to ask me for my ID and told me I looked young. He asked me a bunch of questions about where I was staying and who I was here with. He then told me he needed to take my ID and show it to his manager. OKAY WTF! He came back and I told him I would just leave and to let me just take the room key back up. He said, If i called metro right now you would be arrested for burglary. UHHH for burgaling what exactly??? What in the hell. So I called my friend not knowing whether she would answer and told them what was up.. . They came down and rescued me. I think he just wanted proof that I knew people who were staying here because yes, he thought I was a lady of the night, working the TI. I was still in clubwear, mini dress and heels. Could be read as hooker, but I'll credit my girlfriend with saying "you looked like you were gonna put out maybe, but you don't look like a prostitute." Thanks gurl.  Beleive me cargo pants man, if I was hustling for $$ I most def would not do it at this dead ass budget ass hotel.. . This hotel does not know what the hell they are doing! Stay away.
I came here for my birthday and Valentines weekend and Treasure Island was the perfect hotel for my boyfriend and I.  Not only was the price very decent and cheap but the room was very nice and perfect size for us.  At first you would think because it's a cheap price the rooms would be looking cheap but not for this case.  The rooms seemed to be very dated and clean.  The king size bed was very comfortable and the bathrooms were very large with a great large bath tub.  Overall the hotel well fit my needs and expectations and will definitely be staying here again.
I think this hotel is a good deal for a place to stay on the strip.  It is not high end by any means. It is budget, but you are paying a bit more for the resort feel. If you are not made of money, this is your best option. I stayed here in November 2013. The place was busy, but no big lines at check-in when we arrived.  FYI everyone will be charged the resort fee per night which was $25 at the time I went. It doesn't matter what deal you paid for or what your travel agent told you, you are going to have to pay it no matter which hotel you stay at in Vegas.  But, to make up for the fee TI at least gives you coupons for meals, drinks and gym which pretty much makes up for the cost.  The buffet is just alright, nothing spectacular, but the wait in line was never long.  The casino is pretty standard, but if you look around it pretty much has everything you could want.  The other restaurants are pretty decent too.  Senor Frogs and Kahunaville  are fun places to get your drink on and use those coupons for food. . . The room was nice and quite spacious and clean for a basic with two queens with a large bathroom, small, empty fridge and safe. No coffee makers provided in rooms in Vegas anymore. You have to pay extra or go to Starbucks which is right downstairs.  We didn't get the strip view since I thought the back rooms are quieter.  We got a great view on a high floor, but there is a train that goes by and blows their horn all through the day and night. There is a tram to the Mirage which was awesome and the self parking lot was not too hard to find a space. All the staff people I encountered were nice.  Overall, if your not high maintenance or require specialty accommodations and just was to have a chill time in Vegas, I think you will be happy with this hotel.
They must believe in outlets because it was really difficult to find enough outlets for my tablet, phone and portable charger. Since I was on a work trip these were pertinent items to have. The second day of my trip I almost ran out so I had to knock them down a star for that. And considering we had two people in the room, no bueno. . . The beds are a little too soft for my taste and I live next to Boeing field so I'm totally fine with noise, but man, they need to invest in some better insulation/thicker windows. I find it also weird that the light inside the closet didn't have a switch. . . Drinks at the bar downstairs were pretty good. One was enough for me so very true to Vegas tradition they like to go hard. . . I didn't have to worry about paying for this since my company took care of it but they always run deals with the work function we attend so I would call to see if they offer anything.
This is my first time staying at TI. I think I've stayed at a large majority of the hotels on the strip. I was able to check in at 10am which is nice. The rooms are clean and look livable. My biggest complaint is that they don't have a mini bar and there is no drinking water in the room. That's not good when it's the middle of the night and you're dying of thirst. So if you're going to stay here be sure to bring your own water.
