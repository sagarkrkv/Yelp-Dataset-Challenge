This place is delicious! Don't pig out on the rather impressive salad bar because you won't have room left for all the meat!. . I was a huge fan of the bacon wrapped chicken and the bacon wrapped fillet mignon, but all the meats were delicious.. . They give you this fried banana to cleanse your pallet, kinda strange for me because I don't do too much fine dining, but it did what it was supposed to and was surprisingly good. The potatoes they offer you are also delicious. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it!
If you have never been to Texas de Brazil, it is basically an all you can eat meat place. The provide you with a HUGH salad bar which by itself can fill you up if you are not careful. All the items on the salad bar I had were fresh and delicious.. . The waiters walk around the table and slice off meat and everything I had at this location was delicious, although the garlic filet was a bit over powering on the garlic. My favorite was the sausage and the regular filet, you could cut it with a fork.  . . I have been to several other locations and they do a good job of maintaining quality and this location was no exception. Staff here was very attentive and pleasant.
Fantastic experience that I will not be able to afford again for a long time.. . Beautiful restaurant, very attentive and friendly staff, and the food, My Gosh, the food!. . I'll just ramble off some of the highlights.  Salad bar: lobster bisque, smoked salmon, mozarella balls, bacon, and the goat cheese.  Meat favorites:  House specialty sirloin, lamb chops, and filet mignon.. . Left very stuffed and very satisfied.
First time at Texas De Brazil in Vegas.  Having been to one in Dallas previously, I knew what to expect.. . I went with several people in my industry after a trade show.. . The salad bar was just what I needed.  Being a sucker for Spinach, I was able to concoct a spinach salad with all the decadent goodies I wanted, while not spoiling my appetite for the meatfest to follow.  Fresh mozzarella balls, balsalmic, ripe tomato slices...perfect.. . The meats were broiled to perfection, speedily brought around to the tables, and rarely did I see the same cuts, unless I had seen the rest of the variety  first.  The lamb chops and leg were my favorite.
Although the address is correct,  when you use the directions on the Yelp mobile app you are directed to the AIRPORT, not the restaurant about a half mile down the road off Sunset. The food and salad bar isn't too bad. How many filets and potatoes can you really eat until you feel terribly full.
Now Texas de Brazil is my kind of place. All you can eat Brazilian-American Churrascaria (steakhouse). They'll bring it all to your table and all you have to do is flip a little card green for more and red for no more. I like it so much that I was there twice last month and I'm thinking about going later this week. . . My favorite is what I only refer to as the "house special" when asking for more meat. It's a beef top sirloin picanha. The meat is just perfect, good when eaten medium, medium well, or well done. Tender and not overly salty like some of the other meats offered. You can have them fill a plate entirely of the house special, which I did, or spread servings with other items, which I also did. Did I mention this is my favorite?. . The other meats I liked were the beef rib, which was more of the Texan or Americanized aspect. The lambs, I do love lamb came in a lamb chop and another cut with a big bone.  The filetmignon, though the house special is a lot better, and a few others. The ones I didn't like were the chicken and pork ones, dry and/or salty making me drink more and getting full faster, and the BBQ pork ribs. The sausage was ok but didn't care for since there were steaks.. . Service was good and friendly. Sometimes the guys going around with meat are swarming giving lots of meat. Sometimes drinks are filled when you need them. Sometimes they're on it. But sometimes they're no where to be found and you're waiting for more food, drink, and even the bill.. . I was told by many others that the salad bar is was made Texas de Brazil a better choice over Fogo the Chao it was alright but not enough for me to put it over Fogo. There was the lobster bisque, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, sushi, cheeses, bacon, various salads, smoked salmon, bananas, mashed potatoes,etc.  I don't waste my time much doing salads at AYCE steakhouse unless I'm taking a break from eating meat or if I only ordered the salad bar which is a cheaper option if you don't want to eat any meat. Hahaha yea I know there are those.. . The interior is very nice and it surprisingly holds a lot of people.  There's a bar area also so you can have a few drinks while you wait for your seats.  It does get busy so reservations are suggested. It's louder as you get towards the middle and hard to hold conversations, clubbing music playing, I'd suggest asking for a table along the edge, walls or front.. . Visit their website and signup for free birthday BOGO dinner coupon. Hold on to that coupon until the very end cause someone who sat me jacked the coupon and I had to pull the it from my phone. The person in charge was cool about it. It's about $50 saved. I think they'll also bring a complimentary dessert for your birthday but they didn't do it for me. . . It's definitely worth it and it's AYCE steakhouse so of course it's 5 star.  If you get too full take a nice walk around Town Square or take a taxi that's waiting outside.
The wait was ridiculously  long for no reason, which kinda put a damper on my B-day plans. The Salad bar was ok. good sushi! but the meat they bring around delicious! Im not a big meat eater, I barley like steak so if you love red meat its a must. My favorite was the parmesan chicken. They really should incorporate some type of sea food though. Its pricey so save it for a special occasion or to impress a first date. $150 for a salad bar for 2 & meat. The Ambiance is romantic too. I probably wouldn't go back at all . Its just not worth the wait or price.
Beautiful restaurant with great Brazilian barbecue. It was pretty pricey, but I wanted my husband's first experience with Brazilian barbecue to be good.. . The food was delicious, big salad bar, & I have to agree with everyone else it was the best lobster bisque I've ever had! Everything was fresh.. . I would definitely go back more if it wasn't so pricey.
I am absolutely in love with this place! I was a bit weary at first because everyone said it was all you can eat meat. So I thought that would be all I was eating, but sweet mother of God, that salad bar... yowza! The best salad bar I've ever seen. The meat was fabulous too. All around fun experience. I can't wait to return.
Our favorite Brazilian Steakhouse. A huge variety of meats, several different steak options along with lamb, ribs, chicken, Brazilian sausages and a lot of other good stuff at the salad bar. We usually go to dinner, I believe it's $45.99, pricey but worth it. This place gets busy so make sure you book a reservation in advance.
This rating is an average of two visits. . . I always like to go to an establishment twice before writing a review -- especially if I am able to go to it twice. For Texas de Brazil, the first time I went there was in Jan 2013 and then I went again in Dec 2013. I must say that there were a few noticeable differences.. . I'm not going to spend too much time on how Brazilian BBQ works. The one thing I would like to mention is that the food is fabulous. There were certain types of meat that can get a bit salty so me being me, I like to grab some jasmine rice from the salad bar to accompany that salty bit. The chicken and the pork can get dry as well. But it never hurt to try one of everything. It's always a delightful experience to be able to try, or attempt to try, all the types of meat that they offer.. . Now onto my real deal. The first time I dined at Texas de Brazil in Jan 2013, my server was wonderful:. . - She gave us a drink menu.. - She was attentive to us throughout the night. . - Near the end, she asked us if there was anything we'd like to eat again or would like to try and she would get the meat/meat carver for us. She named the whole list on top of her head. . . Then the second time I dined at Texas de Brazil in Dec 2013, my server was not as wonderful, for lack of a better term:. . - She didn't give us a drink menu. Just named stuff on top of her head. I had wanted to try the drink my boyfriend had in Jan but of course, she just named the basic sodas and water. . - Near the end of our meal, she never asked us if there was anything else we'd like to try or something we'd like to eat again. Didn't offer any help or assistance. I had to ask her for a list of meats. She, in turn, went to get the "menu" in which took her a good 15 minutes because she forgot about me. Mind you, there were only about 3 total tables in the room. Afterwards, it was one of the meat carvers that offered his assistance and said he'd be glad to get me something that I want to try/eat. Very thankful for him and his attentiveness. . - My check came in a paper menu versus the hard plush receipt folder that the table next to us got. I'm sorry? There were only 3 tables in our section since we were nearing the end of the night and you give me my check in a folded PAPER menu? You can't have possibly ran out of your nice hard plushy receipt holders. . . Our server waited on our table and the table next to us. She was a lot more attentive towards them, had asked them if there was anything else they'd like to try/eat at the end, and their receipt was properly given. . . I'm not going to jump to conclusions and say that my friends and I got discriminated in Dec 2013 but I can't help but to think of it as that way. The huge differences in our servers between the two visits were astonishing. Just because I look young and I look as though I don't have an unlimited budget doesn't mean you can treat me that way. Because when you do, I definitely don't have any budget for you. . . And a tip, if you want to discriminate, don't make it so obvious. . . I really doubt I'd be returning to this establishment.
I tried Pampas and Fogo deChao but I have to say that Texas de Brazil is my favorite. to me, Texas has a larger selection of the salad bar and meats. I always go there everytime I am in Vegas.
Date night!!!!!!!!!!! I don't always eat red meat. So if I'm going to eat it, might as well go all out!!!! . . The bf made reservations for 6:45 and we were seated right when we got there. It was a Wednesday night so I'm sure that we didn't need the reservations, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Our main waitress came by to introduce herself and to take our drink order. My bf had not been here before so she was nice enough to explain how everything worked.. . So here's the rundown: you can help yourself to the full salad bar. Some of the items are obviously salads (spring mix, Cesar, potato caprese, etc) breads and soups. When you are ready for your meats, there is a little card you flip over to the green side. Just be careful not to get full off the salad bar because you obviously are not going to pay +$50 for just appetizers. Servers with various meats come to your table and cut the meat right off the rod onto your plate. When you have had your fill, just flip the card over to the red side so they know you are finished. Your main server brings garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains to the table to cleanse the pallet in between meats so you can get the taste of each individual one. . . Ok, so now for the food. I thoroughly enjoyed the salad bar, maybe a little too much. Our server told us to pace ourselves but I was so hungry and the salad bar was easily accessible. My favorite was the Cesar salad and onion ceviche. I wasn't about to get any rice or beans because the cheese bread at the table was TDF!!! So cheesy and warm!! I ate all of it and only left one piece for the bf. And of course the meats!! They were amazing! The filet minion and flank steak was our favorite. Perfect medium! Moist and juicy.You could really get the true flavors of the meat itself. The sausage and lamb chops were so full of flavor. I didn't get to taste the ribs or chicken, but the bf enjoyed them as well. .  . I have enjoyed myself every time I have dined at this establishment. When I am in the mood for some meat, I know that I will not be disappointed here.
The best dining experience we have had in Vegas so far . The service was very friendly and if you go hungry , something is wrong . Well worth the money !
Really fun experience and AWESOME food!! One of my favorite spots!
Don't waste your time at the casino buffets if you want AYCE.  Go here instead.  Perfectly cooked meats, and good quality meats at that.  Legit salad bar that destroys any casino salad bar.. . SO MUCH MEAT.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the meat bonanza that is Texas de Brazil.. . Also, go for lunch if you can.  Its cheaper and you don't really miss out on much.  Don't forget to sign up for the e-club as well, because you get a 2-for-1 on your birthday!
Very delicious food here!, try the Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breast, OMG!
Went here last night with another couple.  I had to throw a fit with my husband to get him to go here but I think he's glad I did!!  This place is huge inside and decorated very nice.  They have a salad bar which surprised me and it was AMAZING.  They had so much stuff on it, stuff that you'd never even think about,and the meats they serve are HOT and delish..  If your on a low carb diet I would imagine this would be heaven for you.  Not sure about the marinades but they have tons of different meats that they bring to the table and trim off for you.  The bacon wrapped Filet was fabulous, top sirloin was really tasty too.  Chicken was tender and flavorful. They served leg of lamb, pork, and all kinds of other stuff too. I cant wait to take my parents here too eat.  I cant wait to go back myself!!  there were 4 of us in our party and 3 of us had 1 round of drinks and one had 2 drinks.  We all ordered the full menu and our bill was $262.  They do offer a "lite" menu and that just includes the salad bar, but do yourself a favor and pay the extra and get the whole thing (if you like meat that is)!!  This place is great!! The only thing I'd say is if your looking for a quiet date place where you dont have the server around too much, then this place wouldnt fit that, becuase they come around a lot and offer the meats.
