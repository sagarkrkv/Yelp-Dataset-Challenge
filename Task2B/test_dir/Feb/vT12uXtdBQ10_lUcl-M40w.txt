This place was not expensive and the location is perfect.. . BUT..... . The rooms were pretty dirty though. There were stains on the bed that made it really hard to feel comfortable. The floor needed a good shampoo. I feel the bathrooms could have been cleaned a bit more. But honestly, for 40 dollars a night in Vegas it was not that bad at all!! I would come back here if I was broke and couldn't find another hotel. . . Also, if we checked in early they charge your account an additional 17 bucks. I didn't mind because I went during EDC weekend and I wanted to make sure that we got a nice room.
We got a good deal where our average rate was ~$50 including the resort fee. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of the strip so very convenient if you are planning to walk/take the bus to various locations in the area. The hotel is on the older and dirtier side and there was some residual smoke in the halls but a very good value I would say.
We stopped by here to go on our tour (Pawn Stars , fantastic!). . . Bally is very old-style and seems a little run down. I mean, maybe they're doing renovations but it's not as vibrant or lively inside the casino as it is in some. The outside could also do with a paint job.. . To make an assumption, I guess it wouldn't be quite as expensive as most of the other hotels and when you're staying in Vegas you probably want to be right on the strip sowhy not? A room is a room!
I hate to see so many bad reviews about this place. It may be because I only stayed 1 night here, but I had zero problems with this place and plan on returning here for my next visit. My girlfriend and I arrived on a Thursday night. Check-in took about 5 minutes and they gave us a FREE upgraded room to a suite! I know that's pretty customary when you're checking in after 11pm on a weeknight, but the room was incredible. . . The casino itself was very lively. We went back and forth between Paris and Bally's all night long because they are connected. Both casino's had $10-$25 minimums on table games at night and dropped to $5 mins. in the morning. Bally's had more of a selection of penny slots and slots in general IMO. We were also able to visit the Bellagio and Caeser's Palace because they're right across the street. . . Check-out was as easy as filling out a small info card and dropping our room key in the bin - took all of 2 minutes. Overall, had a great stay here and will return. . . Would definitely recommend if it's your first time in Vegas!
Loved this hotel. The room was so nice!! And the strip is right outside from this place. Great views. I will definitely go back!!! Plus they have so much to offer inside the casino.
Considering the location of Bally's on the strip, it's pretty decent for the price you pay. This hotel is located right in the smack middle of the strip and is a short walking distance to most hotels. Back during the partying-on-a-budget days, my girlfriends and I would walk from Bally's all the way to Wynn/Encore in our FM heels with our classy red solo cups in hand no problem .. . This hotel needs a renovation though! Some of the rooms still haven't even been upgraded to a flat-screen TV and the furniture is outdated.. . The casino floor is chill and I love playing Wheel of Fortune in the "high limit slots" section. Let the dyke security guard strike up a conversation with you and she'll give you drink tickets for the bar :)
Solid choice of hotel. In a prime location on the strip, short walking distance to many popular attractions. It's attached to Paris, and because the hotel pool was closed during our stay (2/18/14), guests are permitted to use the Paris pool! Check in and out was quick and painless. Was given free early check in :) And check out is as easy as filling out your room number on a card provided and dropping it in a box at the front desk. Very convenient for those morning-after flights home! Stayed in a room in the Jubilee tower, which contains their renovated rooms. Was very impressed with how modern and fresh it felt! Also has a great view of Paris' tower and pool. Very happy with my stay.
