So I've been here a few times but was never inclined to write a review until now. I must say I was absolutely amazed by the service. Our server was a cute bubbly girl named Merisa. She was really friendly and gave super speedy service. Also my brother had a small complaint about his cocktail not being strong enough and she immediately grabbed it and had the bar tender make it a little bit stronger with no questions asked! it was great how easily she took care of it. Thanks Merisa! . So on to the food, I got a hash with mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes. To be honest it was a bit bland until I poured the yolk from my eggs on it. Then it was perfect! the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. My brother got French toast which came with caramelized bananas on top. He absolutely loved them! I couldn't believe he finished it all. The portion sizes were huge haha. I'll definitely be back and I'll probably ask for Merisa next time.
Portions are huge and not to mention awesome!
I love Hash House A Go Go.  LOVE IT.  But I can't give it 5 stars.  They have a great menu and super yummy specials, but you can't make any changes to what you order.  For example, I don't always want half a plate of potatoes with my breakfast but if you ask for fruit instead, even for an up charge, they won't change it.  They'll give you less food for the same price, but for an additional cost they still won't alter the dish.  Same with lunch and dinner.  It drives me crazy.  My husband and I still take out of town guests here and we think the food is very flavorful and well made, but we rarely go on our own anymore because as much as I can appreciate potatoes (originally a midwestern girl) every dinner and breakfast doesn't need 2-3 pounds of them fried or mashed to make a complete meal.
Be prepared to wait in line if you go on the weekends any time from 10am-2pm.  But it's totally worth it.  The food is great and the portions are absurdly big (which means you have lunch and possibly dinner).. Service is slow- and not that exceptional- but if you have some bloody marys, anything is tolerable.
Food, service and ambiance is 100% conducive to a fantastic time with the Family! :)
gigantic portions.....  I mean ridiculously gigantic.  Delicious and filling.
Good food nice service...
One word description, "Humongous".. . This place already has a big following, but to just add my two cents into the pool of reviews HH is worth it in all aspects. . The food is delicious. . The portions are...Humongous. . The service was great. . The selections are so abundant that you must go back frequently to try all the delicious choices. . The prices are a bit on the upper end, but when you get such large quantities, you know upon the arrival of your order, you get what you paid for.
Banana Peanutbutter Pancakes are great...
Portion way too big with prices to match. Good one time place, but many others surrounding them to try.
While in Vegas we looked up restaurants on the Food Networks's Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives.  This came up and we decided to check it out.  One word HUGE!  The portions are ginormous!  So large that the dishes came with the steak knife sticking out from the top to hold it together!  We had The Kokokmo, Big O' Crispy Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich and Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese sandwich.  All very tasty and had to bring home leftovers!  A definate must if you get the chance!
I like this place.  Great breakfasts and nice portions and it isn't overly expensive.  Definitely going to go back there.
What a treat.  You can find some good restaurants off the strip and this is one of them.  Even though they built a couple of these in casinos, this one will always be the original.  I was looking for something different and discovered this place.  Glad I make the hike to try it out.  You get large portion of what you think is typical fare, yet they seem to put a fusion flare to all their dishes.  Wait can be long due to the popularity.  Give it a try, I think you will like it.
Short: Sub-par food in large proportions dressed up for no reason with a loud atmosphere. . . Visited this place with a friend after we've been curious of it after a long time. Disappointed, big time. Food was decent, service was decent, place the decent, atmosphere was loud. . I ordered some chorizo hash, and my friend had french toast. The hash had deep-friend potatoes (probably from frozen), with some sauce and cheese on top. The chorizo was the soft type that just turned into liquid after it was cooked so there was only a few chunks left. It was alright, not mind blowing.. My friend's french toast was worse. It was made of thick slabs of bread (good, right?) that had barely touched egg before they were fried--it was pretty much bread with a egg coating on the outside. If you didn't know: French toast is bread SOAKED in egg, and fried. But this was barelytouched, so it was like eating hot bread rather than eggy goodness. The toppings were a bit bland as well.. . Bottom line: If you want to go to a place that puts more priority on decorating, than actually making your food taste good, go here. Big proportions that don't need to be that big, dressed up for no reason, decent food.. . Next time, we're probably going to head to Ihop or Denny's. Same food quality, better service, cheaper, and they don't play with our food.
Ok, I understand all the hype on this place - their portions are for fatties, the food is kind of tasty, and it's hip. Cool dude.. . However, this is not a place I ever seem to crave. It's super busy most of the time and I hate waiting to eat at a restaurant that I'm not crazy about. Perhaps I haven't ordered the right item to make me feel this way yet, and that's why I'm not on the same page as everyone else. . . The few times I had eaten here, the food was not horrible, just nothing really memorable (other than the size of the colossal dishes) to make me crave it. If portion over taste was what I was into, this place would be top of my list. But it's not. . . The last time we ate here, I ordered the chicken and waffles which was very unimpressive. It was completely dry. I should've tried something else because I don't think anywhere in town beats DW Bistro's Jerk Chicken and Waffles, so maybe that was my mistake. The portion was of course too large, and it seemed like everything was just thrown on the plate. I didn't feel like the flavors complimented each other well at all. My Bloody Mary with the Bacon strip was ok. I don't know. This place just didn't do it for me during my last visit.. . Maybe next time (if there is a next time) will be better.
Best Chicken & Waffles. They run a strip of bacon through the waffle though, which gives you a gross, rubbery, not crispy bacon strip. I get it without the bacon. Enough for two.
I love that they put the giant sprig of rosemary on the mashed potatoes
Awesome service and fresh food! Avocado bacon cheddar cheese double  burger was awesome!!
I like hash house. I first went to one in san diego. It is great. huge portions. Good food. Good service. I recommend getting reservations. This place stays packed.
I loved the homestyle cooking. The portions were huge; my pancake was literally bigger than my head! The servers were very friendly and quick to serve us.
the wait was a nightmare. during my trip to Vegas, i lived off one meal a day - which was not really intentional but it kinda just happened. Night after night of going out and what not really drains you and when you wake up, your famished!!! so here i was, FAMISHED. and i think we waited for an hour? hour and a half? but for a party of 8 :\ so that could have also been a factor... anyways, if your hungry come early is what i learned.. . on to the food. there are soooooo many choices to choose from! i love breakfast food and everything sounded so delish! i figured i should split because i heard the portions here were SKDJFSLDKJDLFJ OUTTA THIS WORLD... and they were... but hey - that means i have food to eat when i get drunkchies. I ordered the  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken which came with mash potatoes eggs? a giant biscuit oh it has BACON lol every fat kid's dream. i dont know how to describe this to you but it was just simply amazing. it was even more amazing eating it at 4 am. Each time a plate of food came out my eyes were LITEREALLY like O.O DAYUUMMMMMMM. seriously, the portions here are huge. HUGE. even people who were splitting had a hard time finishing... but yeah place is definitely worth it. it is pricey but for the portion you get, its  pretty cheap.
i love this place and everything in it.. . portions are huge.. . food is delicious!. . service is great.
So apparently when I'm in vegas, my diet goes out the window. Rather than doing our usual brunch buffet at the Wynn or other casinos, we opted to get Hash House. I wanted to go to this location off the strip because the wait isn't as long (I get very angry when I'm hungry. The snickers bar commercials where ppl turn into crazy angry hungry monsters definitely applies to me haha). ALSO after we left, we met BJ PENN & GOT A PHOTO W/ HIM!!! :D Being a girl that's into MMA, I was so happy.. . There's patio seating outside for those that want to get your tan on in the nevada sun, but we opted for indoor seating. The service was very friendly, no complaints there. . FOOD:. . Mushroom, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke scrambled egg white hash & ordered extra side of ham steak - What can I say? I'm a petite girl w/ a big appetite. I devoured this whole cast iron plated meal except for a few pieces of potatoes. You seriously get enough potato wedges to last for days here. Everything was cooked perfectly. Eggs weren't overcooked. There were plenty of mushroom, spinach, etc. The biscuit was warm and flaky, I doused it in butter and honey. I was in heaven! The ham steak was huge, but good and not super salty. . Chicken Pot Pie - my bf ordered this and I helped him out a little 'cause I was still hungry after eating my dish LOL. I loved how this wasn't just ordinary chicken pot pie. It's served in a cute giant hat w/ gravy oozing everywhere. Dish came out piping hot and fresh! There were plenty of chicken breast pieces throughout each bite and yes...loads of potato wedges. I really like the gravy here, everything tasted so home made. I'd recommend this dish over the fried chicken biscuit benedict. . Andy's Fried Chicken Biscuit Benedict - 2 of our friends ordered this and it was just ok to me. I know it's a popular item, but it really did just taste like fried chicken w/ biscuits...nothing too special. At least the fried chicken wasn't too greasy. . Watermelon lemonade - IT LOOKED SO AWESOME!! check out my pic http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Eh9jlsKXJIN8N9CuLnIsQ/ms.jpg. Tasted really refreshing and not super sweet. The watermelon wasn't overpowering either.. . Caramel Coffee w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream - So my friend ordered this cause we had serendipity the night before. This basically tasted like any other frappe, but great palate cleanser for all that food!. . I love the big portions at hash house and the pricing is just right for what you get!! I know they have one back home in CA,but it's all the way in SD :( They're expanding like crazy in vegas, how about building one in Orange County?!
Great place, massive portions. Could split one order to 3 every time! Great place to go after marathons :) Yum yum!
ate here last year during march madness.... . the portions here are ginormous.  that being said, my tapeworm was well fed for the next few hours.  regular people like yourselves can probably share.. . my friends and i went out there for breakfast.. breakfast time being noon.  lol.  prices are more than reasonable than hitting a breakfast join inside any casino.  fresh squeezed oj to top it off.. food coma at noon.  what could be better?  hitting a 4 part parlay afterwards!. . it's def a place to try if ur on a budget, getting over a hangover.. make ur way out there, you won't be disappointed!
Hash hash a go go is named accurately because you will have to go go if you know what I mean before you leave.  Service was slow, the food came out for our table at three different times. While the food portions were large the food tasted bland and was barely warm.
Sage fried chicken biscuit Benedict for the win! Loved everything about it. Well over 2 servings, made for perfect leftovers. The fresh squeezed tangerine juice was amazing  as well. Food came fast and service was good, I'll be back
Incredible breakfast! I love coming here everyone in in Vegas.  I have tried most menu items and they are all fabulous.  Must try if you have never been here.
Pricey and food was decent. It didn't teally stand out. I prefer Eggworks.
Freaking Sage Chicken and Waffles were Amazing! Stacked High and decorated well. Others on here might say no flavor, but my experience was the opposite! My chicken was so juicy and so crispy despite being covered in warm syrup. The waffles alone would be worth the 30-45 minute wait! I am A Believer In Hash House!
I think it's overrated, the wait is long also. . The homemade corned beef hash was good though
OMG, where do I begin? The few times I've gone here, we've had to wait for seating. Funny, because there weren't any other people waiting to be seated and there were clean unoccupied tables, but whatever. They're pretty much tied with The Cheesecake Factory as far as portions go. My man looooves to eat and even he couldn't eat all of the food. Our favorites are the blueberry pecan pancake and the chicken omelettes.
This review is for the chicken and waffles.  This place is over rated.  Surprise the average is 4 stars.  Chicken was dry and waffle had a breadlike texture.  I like my waffle to have a little crunch on first bite. Chicken and waffle are both flavoreless. Don't be fooled, it looks better than it taste.. . I was going to give it 2 stars but we had a reservation.  We arrived on time but our table was not ready.  We waited for another 15-20 minutes and almost missed a show we were scheduled to watch that same evening. Def not coming back.
Delicious! Over the top and fabulous! Everything is good there-- everything. And ENORMOUS portions.
Biscuits are huge and amazing!  That in itself is a crazy appetizer!  . . The food is very decent, and the portion is grand!. . Had some type of chicken dish, it was delicious!  . . Note:  Ask about the mashed potatoes before ordering.  If you don't like wasabi, don't get it!
Hash House is a unique place with food mainly unlike other restaurants.  Huge portions with generous use of quality ingredients keep me coming back!  I love their breakfast skillets and burgers - both loaded with avocado!
I first decided to eat here after seeing the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict on Man vs. Food. Since then I've been back several times.. . Out of all of the times that we've been, I've only tried 2 items. The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and The Mashed Potato Stuffed Burger. Both are absolutely delicious and there is no need to order anything else on the menu (I'm sure the rest is good though).. . My wife loves the chicken and waffles, and gets either that or the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I keep telling myself that I'm going to try something new, but I never do. I'll definitely be going back though, because we always have lots of leftovers.
