Forum Shops at Caesars Palace dining gem, Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is the culmination of a partnership between Lettuce Entertain You, ICON and Joe's Stone Crab, the legendary seafood restaurant of Miami Beach. Originally opened in Chicago in the fall of 2000, Joe's features an extensive selection of seafood, flown in fresh daily, to complement the world's finest Florida Stone Crab claws. Joe's has quickly built a reputation as a top steakhouse in the city of sin, featuring their signature 16 oz. New York Strip Steak. Matched with Joe's famous side dishes, dinner only gets better when capped with a slice of key lime pie.  Enjoy a generous cocktail in the bustling lounge or the tuxedo-clad service of the clubby dining room and you'll understand why dinner at Joe's has quickly become one of Las Vegas' favorite social engagements. However, if you are looking for mouth-watering eye candy waiters, don't go during lunch. FYI...they seem to only appear during the dinner shifts.. . Cheers,. . Jordan & Marks
This is as good as it gets! I remember the time a few years back when I came in to this steakhouse and asked them what are stone crabs?!? The server went to describe these succulent crab legs unlike any I've had before, cooked and served cold with mustard sauce....perfect! Now I love seafood and this was simply amazing.. . I come to Vegas from time to time and I always look forward to eating at Joe's. Sure they make great steaks, after all it is a steakhouse but these crab legs are to die for! Pair it with a martini (Sapphire straight up with olives always hits the spot!), white wine, sides of Jennys mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, green beans almondine. You can't go wrong!. . Servers are great and attentive. Layout of the restaurant is classy with a nice vibe to it. There is a back area for dinner reservations but I like sitting in the patio (see and be seen!) as well as the bar area. Even once a nice gentleman bought me a glass of wine. . . Anyway, I eat here at least 1-2 times per year during fun visits to Vegas. This location is at the end of the Forum shops right near Las Vegas Blvd (the Strip) so you see it right as you come in. or if you are coming from the casino, you have to walk a long way to get here (but it is worth it!).. . Oh in the bar there are a couple of HD televisions so I did take in the 2014 Sochi Olympics mens figure skating. Cool.
This is definitely fine dining.  The food is very good; I had the filet mignon and tasted  Jenny's mashed potatoes (a must!) and creamed spinach.  I enjoyed every bite.  The service is great; our server was well versed on the menu, which was helpful.  We split the birthday brownie sundae for dessert and it didn't disappoint.  If you have the extra money and want to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere with great food, give Joe's a shot.
Excellent service. Strong drinks. One of the best steaks I have ever had. ..  And I've had many . D
Everything about dinner at Joe's was awesome. Especially on Valentines Day.. . We had reservations but were running late. We called and they allowed us to push it back 30 min. Who's ever on time in Vegas right?. . Oysters Rockefeller = Great appetizer!. Stone crabs = Great appetizer!. . Im sure any steak would be good there. Had the 12oz filet, medium.  And guess what? It was perfectly cooked medium. I could use a butter knife to cut my steak!. . Then, when you think it couldn't get any better, our waiter brought over some steak spices. Just a tiny sprinkle on top of your meat and the flavor explodes! From that point on I cut my steak into even smaller bits and savored each one for some extra time. We nicknamed the spices "Steak Cocaine!". . Great night! Could not have started off a better night in Las Vegas without eating dinner at Joe's first.
The New York Strip was amazing, but overpriced in my opinion. Sides are not very large; splitting with another person left me wanting more. Great atmosphere and staff.
Overpriced menu, arrogant waiters, food was just ok. With all the choices in Vegas go somewhere else.. . We had a group of 6 and they added 20 pct tip to our bill. $300 per couple
Place was okay. Was expecting a lot more due to its popularity. Service I found to be lacking. I noticed the majority of other patrons were 40+ years and over. Maybe that's why the service for us was not very good (since we were all males between 20-30 years old). Portions were average to below average. Stone crab claws were good, but pricy (to be expected). Probably would not go again, unless the person(s) I'm with wanted to go.
YES YES, A THOUSAND TIMES YES! My fiance took me here for my birthday. Everything down to the free bread was amazing ! We got the stuffed mushroom appetizer. I seriously dislike mushrooms but my fiance insisted and they were delicious! I was blown away! . We both got the filet mingnon and OHHHH EMMMM GEEEE. It was perfect. My mouth was watering. They give you some extra seasoning just in case and I took that as well as an extra container (I asked them for it) home with me. I currently have their steak seasoning in my seasoning collection lol. . We also got their mashed potatoes and I figured they'd just be regular potatoes nothing special. But wow...they put all sorts of cheese on it and bake it i believe. I got the large size and it's way too much for two people. We had to take the rest home! . The server was attentive and personable. I usually assume in such a nice restaurant the servers would be stiff and boring but she was awesome !. The only thing i wasnt to hot on was my birthday dessert. It was f
Great gluten free options. Have a gluten free menu and the waitress filled out a hot pink allergy alert card for the kitchen. I had the salmon, dairy free, with a plain baked potato.
