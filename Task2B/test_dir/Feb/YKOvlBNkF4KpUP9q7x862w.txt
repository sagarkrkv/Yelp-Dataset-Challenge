How did I forget this?. . This placejust rocks all the way around. Even with their overpriced drinks and retarded wait times. . . Just go.. . Get the Guac and the Porkbelly . . Oscar the Grouch used to be orange. Jim Henson decided to make him green before the second season of Sesame Street. . . Did you know that? No. You didn't. This has officially been the most helpful review you have ever read. You're welcome.
Jack in the box was a better choice. The Customer Pool Was Deeply Immersed In Trash Talking About the service
Service is very hit and miss and when it misses it misses by a mile.  Waitress was not attentive at all.  Felt like we were forgotten.  Food is alright, nothing special.  The Phoenix area has many great Mexican restaurants and this isn't one of them.  Wouldn't come back because of the service.  The food isn't good enough make up for the bad service.
LOVE this place. The food is magnificent. Every time we have an out of town guest we take them to Mission.  We have been for dinner many times and for brunch. Amazing menu. Love the table side guacamole...and every entree we have tried.  You have to make a reservation.
The ambiance is great...I'll give it that.. . Service, however, was full court press, and yeah i understand that they are trying to turn over tables but when I am paying a final tab of $100+ for 3 petite taco plates and 2 cocktails (me and my date) i expect a bit more than food artistry.. . Frankly, great concept by way of decor...but a bit too pretentious for my taste. Its a place to 'be seen' and to impress someone with but not particularly cozy nor intimate..i.e. if you go for more than dim lighting.. . I certainly would go back but with adjusted expectations.
This place has amazing food. I have tried several things here but my favorite are the steak tacos. Yum!!
This restaurant is fantastic in every way, it offers a multi-sensory experience which is impressive in terms of ambiance in addition to food and drink.. . The amount of thought and intentionality is evident in the way that many small details are well attended to including the use of Himalayan Rock Salt bricks to keep tortillas warm to the interior reflecting a classic Latin American mission through lighting and catholic symbology.. . If you don't like it, you shouldn't be writing restaurant reviews for others. Enjoy.
BARF! Gave it a extra star for the ambiance and decor that was the only thing this restaurant had going for itself.
This is currently my FAVORITE restaurant in the valley. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the FOOD to the decor is fabulous. I've never ordered a bad thing on the menu. Everything has so much flavor. I love how the portions aren't ginormous - you leave full and satisfied but never feeling stuffed. The front patio is adorable, complete with a fireplace. The back patio is more spacious and offers heat lamps at night. The inside dining room is gorgeous but can be loud.. Favorites are: Pork shoulder tacos, skirt steak tacos, mahi mahi tacos, grilled corn, tableside guacamole. Margaritas are great.. Just learned of the "Sunday pig out" - $16 per person for all you can eat taco bar (this may change from week to week but it was pork shoulder tacos last Sunday) and half price bloody mary's, mimosas, bottles of wine.
The other night, my cousin invited me to dinner. I didn't know where I wanted to go, so I told her to give me some options. She sent me a text message with a laundry list of restaurants, some I had never heard of. I didn't know where to go, so I sent my foodie friend Gina a text message with the list of restaurants. She replied, "The Mission. Boom!" I had never been there before, so I wanted to try several things on the menu. From the guacamole to the duck confit empanada, EVERYTHING was delicious. Oh, and they infuse tequila with lime juice for some of their signature cocktails. If you want an authentic Latin cuisine experience, then you need to try The Mission.
Delicious tacos and guacamole was amazing! Fun place to be but noise level was a little too loud for a conversation.
Great food, great atmosphere, great service! . . Have been here many times and have always had a great experience. Have been here for both romantic dinners and drinks with friends and enjoyed The Mission either way.. . A unique and satisfying menu. . . Will definitely keep coming back!
This place was excellent!  The boyfriend had recommended this place, and we decided to try it for Valentine's Day.  We made a reservation online, which was really convenient especially for a holiday.. . The margaritas are really good.  I had the primarita, which the server recommended as it is the most popular.  It was really good.  The boyfriend ordered a smokehouse margarita, which definitely pulled through with it's name.  It had a smokey flavor and a spicy kick.. . We started out with the grilled street corn, which came with a mayo-based sauce that was incredibly flavorful, and a little spicier than I expected, but in a good way.  I ordered the short ribs, and the boyfriend ordered the chorizo porchetta.  Both were very flavorful.  I really enjoyed the cheese sauce that came with the meat.. . The ambiance and decor were perfect. I read reviews stating that it was too dark, but it was never too dark for me to read or see what I was eating.  Our server was very friendly and our glasses were always filled.. . We would definitely go again!
Really enjoyed the ambiance, table-side guacamole/chips/salsa, and desserts.. . My sweet potato tacos were meh, but my partner's Mahi Mahi tacos were light, bright, and tasty (small portions). The pumpkin bread pudding and fried bananas (large portions) were yum and a nice way to end the meal.
One of my favorite Mexican food places in scottsdale. I would definitely recommend coming here if you haven't yet. The fish and steak tacos are some of the best that i have had.
This is a review for the fellas, but ladies - pay attention:. Guys, there is only one reason to go to the mission, and it's to take your lover there and show her that you are a man of distinguished tastes and also that you have slightly too much money, but not too much that you're frivolous - just enough extra that you can afford things like expensive tiny tacos and fancy drinks.. . When you go to the mission, maybe it's best to eat inside, because the lights are low, and the wood is dark, and it's moody - do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a romantic atmosphere.  So first get some drinks, and I recommend their margaritas, or their tequila mojito, but if you're a guy only order the tequila mojito if your lady already knows that you are a strong lover, because you don't want to send the wrong message, but it's an amazing drink.. . Next, it's time for the tacos.  Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.  They're sold three at a time, so your will order three tiny tacos, and your lover will order three tiny tacos as well, and then maybe once the food comes, you have an opportunity to swap one.  Or maybe two.  Do you see what I'm saying?. . Finally, desert.  Hey, get another drink and get some fried bananas - that's both a suggestive dish, and something delicious, and it lets you both set the mood for what happens after dinner.. . That's it.  If you don't like the food or drinks, you don't know what good is, and if you haven't set the mood right, then you have nobody to blame but yourself (or maybe you need to be more discerning about your choice of lovers).  The Mission.
This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. It is so amazing! I love the ambiance, the interior decor style, the food and the service is always great. This is the only place that makes me miss eating chicken as the chicken taco's are so fantastic. I've been a full vegetarian for a few years now though and let me tell you, there butternut squash tacos are so delicious, so make sure to order them. My favorite thing there is the table side guacamole! I love the guys that come over and make it for you (don't forget to tip them, it's the nice thing to do) and they make some bomb guacamole. I brought my parents there and my dad typically hates guacamole but he tried the table side guac here and he ended up eating the whole bowl! . . The restaurant is always busy, which is always a good sign. So, be sure to make a reservation. If you didn't make one, don't worry, just walk-in because there's usually room in the bar or somewhere on one of the two patios.
I highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone. By far my favorite place I ate at while in Scottsdale for the weekend. The food and service was 5+ stars. Also, make sure to have reservations made before going. Super popular place to go too!!!
We loved it!  We had a reservation for 6 and they sat us immediately.  The servers were fantastic and made excellent recommendations.  The primata margarita is very good. My friend and I shared the pork tacos for two. It was good but I think the others loved their meals more based on their reactions.  The guacamole was good and we liked how we could get different versions...hot was the best!
This is the third time I have been to the Mission.  The first two were for dinner, the third time was for lunch.  I travel to Phx/Scottsdale and the food here is a can't miss.  At night, it is more of a scene with low lighting and a great atmosphere. In the day, it was totally different very laid back, warm and inviting; especially if you are seated at a table outside with the sun shining down on you. The guacamole is amazing and the street tacos were great with a unique twist.  Also, if you want to experience great food without spending too much, lunch is a great option.
The service was scatterbrained and the food was good but the timing was a mess.  It's really hit or miss with this place.
Just come here!  This place OOZES sexy!  I am sure it will be 5 stars when I eat a full meal... but for now the ambiance, fresh made guacamole, champagne and SEXY environment has me wanting more!  Great patios, service, people and ALWAYS packed.  Reservations required unless you want to be smashed at the bar... I don't mind it's worth the visit!  LOVE this place and on my list of ideal romantic dinner places!
Had the table side guac, pork shoulder tacos, roasted corn, and black bean side. All very good. At first I thought the pork taco serving was small for two people but once you add it to the small corn tortillas and other toppings its plenty. Service was excellent we were seated outside under a heat lamp and someone came over and placed a cloth napkin on the ground where my purse was to protect it. Drinks were my only disappointment but since this is based on personal preference I still gave 5 stars. The mojito mint was not muddled and the wine selections were limited. I tried three different drinks and none really wowed me but the food more than made up for it.
