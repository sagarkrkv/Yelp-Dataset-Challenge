Penny. The Gazillionaire. Penny's Sock Puppets. . You don't need to understand it now. You'll have your "ohhhh" moment when you're falling out of your seat from laughing so hard. . . That is, if you're ok with raw, dirty humor....and a bunch of stereotypical racist jokes. . . Definitely not your typical Vegas variety show. I won't lie, a few of the acts were a bit slow but Penny and The Gazillionaire really turn things back around with a raunchy quickness. . . "If you're uncomfortable by words like f@ck or sh!t then this isn't the f@ckin show for you.". . Oh Gazillionaire, how you underplayed that. Well done, sir, well done.
Without a doubt, this is one of THE most entertaining shows I've seen here! . . If you're looking for comedy, talent, amazement, raunchiness, and an overall memorable show, this is definitely the one for you.  Each segment is so fun to watch and awe-inspiring.  There are so many laughs to be had but not if you're overly P.C. or uptight, LOL.  . . My biggest complaints are the price (one of the more expensive shows I thought) and the seats.  The day we went the seating consisted of different sizes/shapes/types of folding chairs. My husband and I actually switched seats because his folding chair was too small for him... I've read that, in other shows, they have consistent seating with wooden chairs but they don't sound much more comfortable. . . Since we went for a birthday celebration we considered getting the upgraded (VIP) tables.  Small tables with slightly bigger folding chairs, LOL.  So glad I didn't upgrade. . . Right now you can get $25 off if you enter keyword "local" when you buy your tickets. Upgraded seats aren't included with the discount.  . . Get your tickets and get ready for the funnest 90 minutes of show watching you will have in Vegas!
Crazy awesome aerial shenanigans with filthy jokes? If that's not Vegas I don't know what is.. . Also, the roller skating duo was probably one of the best things I've ever seen... And maybe will ever see. . . Don't want to get into too much detail and give anything away, but go. Go now. . . Just don't sit up front if you're not into heckling or have a fear of decapitation. . . Also have some drinks before and arrive early to queue up! Be ready to be amazed.
Under the tent in a throwback setting designed to transport you back 150 years while while escorting you into a celebration of appreciation for humanity and creativity, Absinthe unfolds quickly and candidly. Actors, acrobats and audience partner to generate laughter and surprise. It's a side-splittingly funny script, a bit of lovely choreography suspended above the stage and on a high wire, and pee-your-pants laughing while pointing at the-poor-guy-in-that row improv. I saw it tonight and I'd go again right now if I could. . . Four and a half stars would be my rating, if Yelp offered the option. The little complaint we have is the role of Shelly, whose singing is not great, and who's songs' purposes are not clear (except as filler, and Penny is written for this, so why do we need Shelly?)
Great circus acts mingled with gratuitous vulgarity and verbal pornography. . . This show proves H. L. Mencken right. "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.". . In my estimation, the audience was split between those who tolerated the vulgarity to see brilliant acrobatics and demonstrations of strength, and those to whom Mencken was referring. . . Not recommended for anyone with any sensibilities.
Show is absolutely fantastic. Great show & great skits.. highly recommended. Only suggestion I would def. Give is to purchase the upgraded seats for the additional $25.. trust me you'll be glad you did... If your the type to get offended by swears and vulgarity this show might not be for you... def. Made for 18+.. Alot of funny sexual contents...
Zumanity without the training wheels or censor. Amazing acts considering it's in a tiny tent with NO strings attached. Great music and very funny although very vulgar comedy skits. If you're a sensitive person who is easily offended this is not for you. . The acrobatic routines are incredible! Well worth the price of admission
Wow!!! We loved this show, it was funny and entertaining. I could see this show again, it was everything and more. Seats could be upgraded, a little cheap for the price you pay. Best show I've seen in Vegas .
Holy raunch-tastic and I say that in the greatest way possible. If you blush at crude or politically incorrect humor, this show is NOT for you! The circus type atmosphere is intimate and amazing. The performers are so talented that you are left with your mouth hitting the floor but beware, if you are in the first three rows with this expression on your face you might get called on the stage to give a lap dance in a 69 position to the 80 year old gentleman sitting beside you. Oh and, I'm not joking!! The night is filled with incredible performances mixed with full on belly laughter as long as you're not one of the chosen ones that everyone is laughing at. Well worth it if you are traveling to Vegas, sans children. It's so entertaining I would definitely go back and see it a second maybe even a third time.
Hard to describe, and not for the easily offended or the politically correct.. Other than that, make sure you don't miss this show, I highly doubt that there's  anything even close to it anywhere in the United States.  I appreciate that most people don't say exactly what it is about, because going there without knowing much is the best part.
Saw this show with my brother and we LOVED it. I highly recommend paying the extra 25.00 for the best seats in the house. We sat at a table in the front row and could not have had a better seat. Watching the showfrom up front is simply an amazing experience and totally worth it. . . Not much to add to what everyone else has written. The jokes are hilarious (and yes, tasteless). The performances are breathtaking and brilliant. My favorite was Sven and Roma who do an amazing roller skating act. Go see the show for them alone.
BEST SHOW EVER. Laughed until I cried. I have never had a better show experience in my life! GO SEE THIS!
All of the Yelp reviewers are right! . . Pros:. 1. Excellent audience participation act.. 2. Roller skaters are astonishing.. 3. Excellent blend of acrobatics, comedy, and music.. . Cons:. 1. For all shows, for memories and marketing, performers may want to consider being available for pictures afterward like Penn and Teller. Charge at a reasonable price point. It will be a win-win for everyone.. . Tip:. 1. Like all shows, check Yelp and Google for a discount.. http://www.absinthevegas.com/discountoffers/codeABS20.html. 2. If you're easily offended, don't go to this show. Remember this is Vegas.
This is hands down the best entertainment I've ever had - from the laughs and shock to the amazing acrobatics, I was captivated the entire show! . . Not for the faint of heart or easily offended (don't like the F word? not for you. uncomfortable with stero-typing jokes? not your cup of tea. uneasy with nudity? oh, did you forget you came to VEGAS??haha, not for you here either). . . Seating - I think every seat is a winner as far as view goes! It's very small setting so you basicly are right on top of the action. It's a round stage and you get wooden fold-out chairs. Good thing here is you are so entertained, you forget that you are crowded and your ass hurts from the chair. There's AC inside (but not at the tent/bar areas outside the performance tent - so you may go in a bit sweaty if you're waiting around for the second show in the middle of June). There's a bar inside as well, but you won't want to leave your seat once you get in and the show starts, so best to have some pre-show drinks outside and maybe one more as soon as you walk in at the bar inside to take to your seat. There are a couple of options for seats with tables that seem to have a bit more room in the back. I may opt for those seats next time. . . We even saw the cast afterwards at the bar at Cesar's and gave them kudos on a great performance!
I took advantage of a deal with Town Square and snagged a voucher for two tickets. It needed to be redeemed at the box office (located outside near the Absinthe tent), so I went about a month prior to the day I wanted to attend. It was all very simple, and although I didn't mind, I was not given a choice of seating.. . I chose the late show on Valentine's Day and we planned to arrive half an hour to its start at 9:30, but traffic on the property was a nightmare (I should've known). If possible, I would highly recommend the main valet at their Las Vegas Blvd entrance since it's within steps of Absinthe or Spiegelworld (and you avoid the crowded maze through the casino/hotel). . . There was a line to get into the venue, but fortunately, the show started 15 minutes late. The seats are very crowded, so definitely take a bathroom break prior to the show if you have seats in the middle of the row like we did. Otherwise, people may have to actually get out of their seats completely for you to get through (there is absolutely no space between you and the seat in front of you). The venue is intimate, so all the seats seem decent except the rows aren't tiered. We were in the fifth row and we didn't mind too much since most of the acts are aerial. We only struggled periodically to see what was going on the stage. The front row seats are definitely the best, but be prepared to be the center of jokes or playfully assaulted.. . The show itself was extremely entertaining. Hilarious, amusing, and spectacular. The fact that their stage was so small, it made their aerobatic, balancing, circus-type acts even more impressive. A lot of it left you in jaw-dropping wonderment and scrambling for photos (non-flash photography is encouraged). The Gazillionaire and his not-so-trusty sidekick, Penny Pibbets, caused constant rambunctious laughter with their vulgar banter and borderline racist jokes. It was certainly not for the weak-hearted or easily-offended, but I think most people have been warned to leave their parents and kids (it's 18+ anyway) at home. The audience involvement segment revealed the actors' great improv talents and was very entertaining. It's amazing how much they pack into a 90-minute show!. . Long story short, you absolutely need to experience Absinthe. Bring your significant other and/or group of rowdy friends. You've been warned though!
Best show we've seen in Vegas in a long time! Laughed so hard my jaw still hurts and . the mind blowing acrobatics and other crazy stunts were over the top. . . The venue is so cool! It takes place inside of a small, but very well done tent outside of Ceaser's. Not a bad seat in the house in terms of view. . . However, be warned. If you sit in the first few rows, you're likely to be made fun of, sat on and have bodies whizzing past your face at a very high speed. Our friend sat first row and loved it, but you better have thick skin. . . Otherwise, the best seats are the small bar tables near the back. The tent is very small, so even when seated at the back, you're very close to the stage and have an amazing and somewhat elevated view, with a table for your drinks, which is nice. . . Although, like many other have said, this is not for the easily offended. They pretty much go after everyone and everything. Absolutely loved it. . . Very unique and a must see if you're in Vegas!
Best show I have ever seen in Vegas!!!! Hands down! Best $200 bucks we spent the 5 days we were there. My face hurt from laughing. If you are easily offended this is NOT the show for you. There is foul language, nudity, and they trashed some with racial jokes.... I LOVED EVERY MINUTE!!! the performers were amazing... And you are so close it feels like you are part of the show!!! Do yourself a favor go see this!!!
Saw this show on 1/19/14 and had a great time. The show is very, very raunchy and definitely not for people who are easily offended or conservative. I thought it was hilarious and was laughing so hard it hurt at times. Some audience members, though, like the older couple in front of us, probably would have left if the seating wasn't so completely cramped that they physically couldn't leave. I couldn't give the show five stars because while the mostof the acts were certainly good, some were just alright. Two or three acts could definitely be replaced. The show is also overpriced considering the talent level of some of the acts and compared to what the same price gets you at other shows, but obviously worth it if you get free tickets (just suffer through a timeshare presentation like we did) or if you get them discounted.
Loooooooooved it! Unique stage with lots of adult only content! Spectacular talent with two very funny hosts! Quite enjoyed the audience participation too!
Fantastic show!  I will make it a point to see this every time I'm in Vegas. Completely raunchy and over the top humor. The performers are inches from you. Love love love this show!
Just went 2 nights ago !! Loved it .. A lot of adult humor and kept me laughing all night . The acts were all different - I enjoyed the acrobats - advice : skip the VIP tickets - the seats are all the same level and the are hard folding chairs / no big difference in seats except VIP are in the first 2 rows but it was way to close - u couldn't stand up Orr else u would get by an acrobat (your that close) I sat in the 8 th row and had a great view . I bought my tickets at half tickets on the strip . Great show !!
Love Love LOVE this show!!! Top notch entertainment in Vegas. Raunchy, hilarious, amazing & very unexpected! Every act was enjoyable, and the Gazillionaire & Penny are a brilliant comedic tag team duo who flawlessly brought the whole thing together. . . As others have said, if you sit in the front row, you will probably either be made fun of or participate in the show somehow. This is not a show for those who are easily offended, so best to leave Grandma at home (or take her to Mystere). We sat in the second row, and it was fantastic- no trouble seeing anything, AND champagne is included in your ticket price! In that price range, you are also able to enter from an area off to the side of the main entrance which was far less busy with a much shorter line to wait in. . . Be advised, the show is in a tent right outside Caesar's Palace near Serendipity 3, which is perfect, because you can get a Frozen Hot Chocolate (with or without alcohol) if you get to the show early. For the 9:30 pm performance, they don't allow you to enter the tent until 9:20. The festivities officially begin about 9:40, but I don't recommend being late unless you enjoy public humiliation. . . The last thing I would like to mention as a side note- the chairs are VERY close together so if you have any concern about being super close to other people or if you might feel uncomfortable being on a small folding chair for an hour and a half, ask to be put at the tables.  This wasn't worth taking a star away in my opinion, because everything else about the show was so awesome!!! . . I will be absolutely recommending Absinthe to all my out of town guests, and can't wait to see it again!
OMG! OMG! LOVE this show. Laughed so hard ourcheeks hurt. Would see it again.
I really liked this show. We were able to get tickets at the tix4tonight booth for $80 each.  Glad we didn't pay full price though. My husbands view was slightly obstructed by a support beam which annoyed him. Like earlier reviews stated, the chairs were uncomfortable and it was a hike to go to the bathroom. . . The gazillionaire and penny made the show. The comedy was offensive and hilarious. I loved the decor on the inside of the tent. So much attention to detail. . . This show was great for my husband and I. I really wanted to see a cirque show, but that would have bored him to tears. This show was a good mix of arts and comedy. It kept him from falling asleep.
