We got a great deal here for our room for a girls weekend to Vegas. We originally were supposed to have a room in the pyramid, which would be smaller, but since they only had rooms in the second level they upgraded us to a tower room for free! So that was nice. Room was a good size, only problem is that the walls were super thin. You could hear our neighbor hacking and snoring and also all his conversations. So that was kind of annoying. Loved having the little convenience store downstairs as well as Starbucks. Also nice that we could wak over to Mandalay Bay without stepping a foot outside! Definitely would not mind staying here again.
This hotel is one that for some reason I haven't stayed at before. Now that I have experienced it this is certainly going to change. As soon as my wife and I walked in we were uber impressed with everything about it. This really should be a 5 star resort as it exceeded our expectations in every way. The suite was immaculate with 2 large flat screen TVs and an incredibly comfortable bed. Our view of the strip from the 9th floor was spectacular too. We ate at 4 of the restaurants at the Luxor and all of them were also amazing.. Two thumbs up to the Luxor!
Here for a long weekend with my husband, kids back in San Diego with my mom & we were looking for a good time. . Pulled up to the valet, they were friendly & efficient as were the gentlemen at the bell desk. . It all went down hill from there.. We did not even make it to the check in desk before we were accosted by two women asking us if we were checking in before directing us to go to this desk to get our "free gift". Free gift? Sounds too good to be true, and it is. The people at the sales desk weren't overly pushy, but seriously, we'd been on the road for 5 hours, we just wanted to check in, rest & refresh, not bargain for tickets to a show.. Check in was...eh. The woman whochecked us in was a little abrupt, but whatever, we were ready to get to our room.. The hotel room was clean, but a little run down and sparse. No biggie, we knew the Luxor wasn't a new sparkly hotel, so that didn't bother us. . What did bother us was that there was no hot water in our room. None. My husband called the front desk & was told they would send an engineer right up to fix the problem. Thirty minutes later he called again and was told that this was happening in several rooms and no one could say when it would be fixed. We were offered a $30 dining credit after my husband started asking more questions. 20 minutes later my husband called again and spoke to a manager who said the problem would be fixed within minutes but would not give us an idea of how many minutes until my husband pushed for a specific time frame. . By this time, we had had enough. We spend enough time at home fighting with people over things like this. We go on vacation so we don't have to worry about things like whether there's hot water, or being  coerced into watching sales presentations.. Not once did anyone offer even a token apology for the inconvenience of not having hot water in our room. No one checked back with us to make sure we were comfortable, or to make sure that the problem had been resolved. No one seemed inclined to give any kind of customer service at all. . So we checked out, less than three hours after we checked in, and went next door to Mandalay Bay.. The Luxor needs an overhaul, both cosmetically & service wise. I doubt we will return here.
I had a King Suite in the pyramid and while the room was spacious, it was too empty. It needed a desk or a extra couch to absorb some sound and look fully equipped.. . The room was very dark. I think they have 15 watt bulbs in every lamp. There is no way you could read a book or see the numbers on the remote. A nightlight is about as bright as these bulbs.. . The casino is nice with a wide range of gaming options.. . The thing that took this from a four star rating down to a two and a half is that they charge $20 per day for "resort fees". This place is not a resort and doesn't even have wireless Internet access. Think about that. 2014 and they still don't have wifi. The ancient Egyptians were definitely more advanced than Luxor.. . I'd stay here again but would not get a suite.
We've stayed here quite a few times and I've never had an issue with this place. The rooms are always nice, bathrooms are nice and clean, beds are comfortable... Can't complain. The casino is great. Not dirty or ghetto. There's a few bars around and Starbucks and evening call and a yogurt place and other restaurants. I believe there's McDonald and Nathan's hot dogs. There's definitely more places I just can't remember them. Great variety to choose from. I have not been at Luxor during summer so I don't know how the pool is here. Maybe that will determine if this place deserves 5 stars... Or the 4 I gave them.
One star: NICE PAY OUTS AT THEIR SLOTS! I won $250 between 2 machines in less than thirty mins. Thank goodness I am one that can easily walk away. . Two stars: Nice steakhouse (Tender...see my review), Sbux and numerous decent 24/7 convenient stores. Nooooow the bad...I booked TWO rooms for three people 3 mths ago. Upon arrival to check in, lady says "You only have one rm reserved"....uuuuuuum, NO. I pull up my email and show TWO king bed rooms reserved under my name. After literally 5 mins of staring at my phone and her comp screen, Lady says "oooh. The other person has a different name for that second room". I gave her a blank look and bit my tongue. Did we get upgraded? Nope. We got two rooms with two double beds on the creepy fifth floor in which the hallway seemed appropriate for filming a horror film overlooking beautiful nothingness. Rooms were ok and clean. . - All 3 of us got massages at their Nurture spa (see my review). Hubby and I got deep tissues and my ma got a swedish. They make you change in a locker room (I was trying to hide my body from everyone else's nude bodies! Seriously?! No changing rooms?! I asked the receptionist and she said there were none. My ma was happy w hers. Mine was ok (I have had better swedish massages). The hubby was satisfied but did not rant about it (Check out the coupon book they give you to get discounts on their massages!) NOT worth full price. . Ok hotel. But next time, definitely hitting up the Mirage again (see my previous review of Mirage!)
It feels very out dated at the Luxor. Like you walked in the 90s. It needs updating. The hotel is clean - no problems there. The high def tv's don't even have high def tv to watch (like to watch tv before bed). It is convenient if you want to spend time at Mandolay Bay..which we did. Our friends were only charged a $35 fee for a 3pm checkout.....I didn't even think to request one....but should have.
I thought my room was very clean, and I was well taken care of as a guest.  I was not in my room alot.  When I checked in, the Air conditioner was not working.. so I told the front desk, and when I returned after my night of fun.. my room was really nice and cool.  I stayed during Superbowl weekend (checked in Fri, left Monday), and the casino was pretty busy, and tables were also pretty busy.  The waitress staff was quick though and usually was around every 15-20 minutes.   Table minimums were $15 on most tables.  The house keeping staff may not speak the best English, but if you need something they will (and not lying when I say this) run to get what you need.   I woulda gave the place an extra half star if I was able to.
How to pay $22 for a pyramid room. I play this game on Facebook called my vegas you play and earn coins and chips, you don't have to buy chips unless you want to, all you have to do is play pretty much every day and you can earn a room in a few months then you can spend your money on drinking and gambling instead of a room you will barely stay in. OK now for the review.. Before looking at other reviews for the luxor I thought we had a 3/10 experience but after reading some of the reviews I now think we had a 7/10.. As I said I earned the room through the Facebook game I only had to pay $22 in resort fees for a room on the weekend. With that said check in took at least 30 minutes waiting in line then at the desk, we didn't get offered an upgrade because the room was booked through the game. We got in the elevator.... Oh girl they are scary because they go up sideways! When the elevator doors opened the walls were covered in construction putty, there was plastic tarps hanging on some walls, I got scared thinking if the hallway looks like it's under construction what will the room look like? Well the answer is the same! The room was cleanish, the bed had been made, the bathroom had been wiped down but half of our towels looked like they had already been used and just hung back up. There were no bedbugs (thank goodness) but the pillow cases had makeup on them, the lights were dim, the carpets were dark (probably so you can't see stains), the furniture was all dinged up and stained. But we kept reminding ourselves we were only paying $22. We went to bed around 4am and we were woken up around 6 am by the clock radio then at 8 am by drilling and hammering from all the rooms around us! It sucked!. But there was good stuff about the hotel the casino looked like fun they also have a cool looking pool, staff was pretty helpful and friendly, free parking, we had clear running water, cold and hot water, working  electricity, good air conditioner/heater, and best of all no bedbugs!!!!!!
Great hotel.I was very pleased with the customer service and the way they attended to my needs.The rooms are spacious and clean, which would definitely make me come back again.Highly recommended.
Not at all impressed with this hotel. Here are my complaints: there was gum all under the tables, the irons suck bad, one ruined a shirt  I asked for another and the on they brought up ruined my pants. The front desk said the would send it to the cleaners(probably the only good thing here), but I was wearing that outfit to go out in, THAT NIGHT! Carpet- dated, windows-filthy, SHOWER!! Let me tell you, it leaked more than water the water actually contacting my body! TOILET- leaks! All around look of the room OLD and DIM! Other that that the leaning crew was very nice and professional, front desk was nice as well. So 5 stars on the Suck Scale, 1 Star on the Yelp scale.
IT'S A GIANT SHINY BLACK PYRAMID!!. . Staff are very friendly and attentive, Pyramid Suite is spacious and comfortable. Bathroom is massive. Shower fits 2 comfortably, so does the tub in my room. I will definitely be coming back. . . Oh... And they have sideways elevators.... . .... And it's a fricken pyramid!! How cool is that?!?!?!?
Stayed here for 4 nights and loved it!  (This review is only for the hotel; I'm not much of a gambler.)  The prices are reasonable, so I was expecting much less upon arrival.  The Pyramid rooms are very nice; spacious, clean and pretty modern.  I booked through vegas.com and everything went seamlessly.  We ate at one of the restaurants in the hotel (Public House?) and the food was great.  I have no complaints and will probably stay here again the next time I go to Vegas.
The building is nice, The rooms were cheap (one star). Your vallet staff and check-in staff are friendly (one star). Other than that, I HATE your staff that pull you at every turn to sign up for some stupid time share tour for reduced price tickets, we were talked into it just to find out the following day we didnt qualify financially, waste of my time! Your buffet is the worst restaurant ive ever been to, left hungry, and ended up sick. My room had a big giant crusty stain in the carpet. Handles and trim looked old, and it took room service at least 10 hours to get the dinner table from the hallway.Never staying there again!
Winner, winner....chicken dinner!!!. . Room was great. Service was impeccable. Who could ask for anything more? . . I will be back!!!
Great place to take kids. Very friendly staff. Sufficient Buffet, no one cares how long you stay which is great. People come to your table refilling your drinks. The hotel also has a walk threw to the Excalibur which is awesome if you have kids. This helps tire them out.
Luxor....what happened to you??? I can't believe how disappointing this place has become! I was really excited to stay here because the last time I stayed here was when I was 9 (14 years ago 2001) and I had SO many memories and it was nice. I guess after 14 years of not giving a sh!t can ruin a once awesome place!. . A LOT of the Egyptian theming is gone but it's still there still somewhere behind all of the shows and exhibits they offer. The casino is VERY small and it felt very low too. I know all of this is true because I have pictures in a photo album next to the casino and it's pretty much gone from those years. . The smell of the place is....interesting. The entire place smelly like a scented candle and it lingered on my clothes even after leaving downtown (lot of smokers there).. . Now the rooms....disappointing as well! It looks as if the  management has given up on here. I mean, come on you can take some extra time and give it a refreshing look! The beds weren't very comfortable, the shower sucked, the stuff/furniture needs to be fixed up a little, wired internet is a joke; I could keep going on about how the room is but I think you got the hint.. . The decor is nice (whatever is left of it) but the obelisk outside is just...vandalized per se with the gum and writing on it :/. . This place is just bad. I regret coming here and wasting my money on something that ruined my nostalgic memories. If they redo the entire place and bring back some Egyptian theming, I may stay here again, but so far all of that seems to look very bleak.. . 2 stars because of the old memories I had
First time back at the Luxor in a long time and were we ever happy to be back! Had been staying at other properties due to the resort fee issue, but now they all seem to charge them. We absolutely love the atmosphere at the Luxor. It is more quiet and the casino is laid out nicely so that you don't feel crowded. There are so many options for eating that you don't ever have to leave! It's proximity to other casinos is nice too. From the check in to the check out we loved our stay. When we arrived Michael could not have been more friendly and accomodating in checking us in. We  were able to get a great room on our preferred floor with a great view. The room was very comfortable, everything worked fine, and it was cleaned promptly every day. We have always enjoyed the Pyramid Cafe and wish it was still open 24 hours. We got great service and quick meals from the Backstage Deli. We had fun at the Flight Bar one night although the drink prices are a little high. Our bartender Steven was very nice. The only black mark goes to the More buffet, it's terrible! We remember it as being so much better back in the day. We went for lunch and were glad it was free because if we had paid for it we'd have been even more disappointed. There were very few offerings and what was there did not look that appetizing. Nothing stood out as being special. So go to the Luxor, skip the buffet, and enjoy the rest of what it has to offer! The novelty of staying in a pyramid never gets old, and we love to listen to the sounds from below from our room. Or sit with a drink in front of the slanted windows and watch the airport traffic. Parking is easy and nothing is too far away. We have so many fond memories of this place and were very happy that this particular stay went so well. Looking forward to our next stay there!
Surprised with the low score here.. . I loved the Luxor. Hotel management were awesome, particularly the concierge. The restaurant range was excellent (including the buffet) and the entertainment was also amazing. I also loved the location and the fact it was physically linked to two neighbouring resorts.. . The casino was more inviting than most, with good service and respectable attire for the cocktail waitresses (unlike some other places). . . The rooms were pretty basic (in relative terms) but, what are you doing in your room anyway? Get oot!. . Absolutely loved the place. It had everything. In a pyramid.
Not a very nice hotel.  The best feature of this hotel is its exterior facade.  The pyramid shape makes this hotel stand out from the competition.. . Other than that, I have nothing positive to say about this property.  Spend your money elsewhere on the Strip.  There are plenty of other options which cost about the same, but are so much better.
I Stayed in the tower, not the pyramid itself.  Clean & spacious room. Hotel had a Starbucks. No complaints here :)
In my opinion I would not stay here. There is no parking and Valet was full. We had to park at a different hotel and walk. Be aware and on your toes because in the lobby by registration at the bottom of the stairs there are time share sales people who are very aggressive. We go to Vegas often and usually stay at the Tropicana. We had a deal and made the change- we will not make that mistake again. Getting in late on a Friday night we could not believe the element of people- we were actually concerned for our safety. Lots of drunks and a very low class crowd- we were shocked that one scary and loudly fighting group were not being escorted out. My boyfriend was almost pick pocketed by a prostitute who got in the check out line behind us. We will not ever stay here again. Our worst experience in Vegas ever.
The Pyramid Rooms are ok. Definitely in need of updating. There was rot on the back of the bathroom door and the tile in the bathroom next to the shower was completely pulled away from the wall with obvious rot and mold. There was mold on the ceiling over the shower also. Luxor is in the dark ages with regard to technology also. No WiFi in the rooms. Tried to use the kiosk for checkout. There was only one kiosk and it wasn't working. They had two iPADs sitting there for checkout but neither of them worked. The line to checkout was about 70 people long. . . The casino and overall public amenities are nice. Overall not a bad place, just needs to be updated and better maintained.
Dirty. Broken elevators. Smokiest casino and rooms on the strip. Would not stay here again.
This hotel isn't bad for the price and location. It is a step up from Excalibur (unless you get Excaliburs newly remodeled rooms) I also don't care much for the restaurants that they have either.
I wouldn't stay at the Luxor again.  The staff was friendly and helpful, but whole hotel feels dirty, dark, and dated.  The rooms are also not well appointed.  There is no wifi in any of the rooms and no min-fridge.  I'm sure they do that as part of their business model so that you'll go down to the casino instead of hanging out in the room, but the place just felt like a Motel 6.  The room was musty and hot and the AC didn't work well and the walls are very thin.  We could hear entire conversations being had by the couple next door.  In addition, we asked for a non-smoking room and the room did seem to be just that.  However, they put a couple of smokers in the room immediately next to us (it was an adjoining room), and their smoke flowed into our room as if there was no wall there.  It was terrible.  Why wouldn't they have entire floors of the hotel designated for non-smokers?  (We were in the "West Tower" on the 8th floor for 4 nights). . With all the other hotels on the strip, which are comparably priced, there is no reason to stay at the Luxor.  In the end, I was happy to put this hotel in the rear view and head back to the real world where smokers are shunned and made to feel small and worthless.
On this trip to Vegas we decided to hotel hop to try out different casinos on the strip. After paying our resort fee we got a near worthless coupon booklet.  I don't mind paying a resort fee if you get something for it. All the pools were closed and drained for cleaning. The so called fitness area was closed as well. The Internet in the rooms is wired only. No WIFI. Makes it hard to hook up your IPad ect. so for the Resort fee you get nothing what so ever at this place. The room we got was old and beat down. We thought staying in the glass pyramid would give a great view. The outside of the windows were so dirty you were looking through a deep haze. We got this room free through My Vegas games and will never return. Free and paying a resort fee was way over paying. As for the casino it's ok. Personally it was way too quiet (no one winning). no excitement anywhere. for us it's OK at best.
This is one of the many MGM International hotel chains.  I recently spent 2 nights here for a business convention trip because the Mandala Bay was booked.  I had 4 choices of rooms to stay in and I selected the 2nd cheapest, since it was on the company.  The room had a nice king bed, 40" plasma, separate bath and shower, unstocked mini fridge and couch.  The room was fine but it was a little dated and dark.  I think it was the Player's Room for about $80 a night.  I didn't like the 12% tax and the additional mandatory $20 resort fee for daily newspaper, gym, internet and local phone calls.  Wifi isn't available in the room, you have to physically connect.  You can only get wifi outside the rooms...........what!?. . It's at the end of the strip and I'd rather stay closer to the middle because all the action and newest hotels are there but it's not bad for the price.  It's easy to either walk from hotel to hotel or take a bus for $6 for 4 hrs and $8 for 24 hrs.  . . They have the Chris Angel "Believe" Magic Show and the Jabbawockeez "Prizm" Dance Crew for entertainment.  You also get 2 comped tickets to their club "LAX", which plays hip-hop, pop, house and techno music.. . If you are on a budget and just need a place to rest and don't mind being at the end of the strip, this is your place.  If you want more updated ambiance and closer to the action, look elsewhere.
My experience wasn't the best. My room was 90 degrees cuz the heater was on and when I switched it to the AC it was broken. They put me in a new room and the AC Was a little better but the room smelt like cigarette smoke, I am a non smoker! They have only 1 elevator for the entire hotel. I had to walk really far from my room to the elevator. The pool was closed for the winter!! I went mid February and it was anywhere from 75-80 degrees! What bogus! Let's just say I will not be staying there again. On the upside the Jabbawakeez show was amazing.
I have to tell you it was clean and hit a price point. However, I hate that they don't tell you about the resort fee, in addition to paying a resort fee you get charged $5.00 every time they bring something to your room....... Not cool. After nearly $100 at dinner and dessert taken to our room...They didn't pack us silverware and charged us $5.00..... LAME. I also got charged $5.00 for an extra blanket.. . Also no internet or reliable cell service in the rooms. Aweful, if you are trying to work and play.
Le Luxor est assez grandiose mais un peu vieillissant. Casino comme on en voit partout a Vegas, il y avait un gogo-danceuse pres du Lounge. . . Les scupltures dans le style egyptien et la pyramide sont vraiment a voir !. . Si ce n'est ca, les boissons sont dans les prix normaux de Vegas, et l'hotel est un peu excentre par rapport aux endroits actuellement "hype" sur le Strip, mais proche du panneau "Welcome to Las Vegas".
Rooms could be a little more updated but it's a older hotel built in the 90's versus the others the are newer.The girl at the front desk upgraded us to a tower room which was built in 2008 still a little outdated. Besides the rooms the overall resort  is nice just too far down the strip away from the center where the action is for my taste. Great pool party Friday -Sunday during Memorial Day weekend.
pretty nice hotel, didn't come across anything bad, the bathroom had those magnify mirrors which was pretty cool so I can do my make up. it was a great stay
The Luxor has always appealed to my senses and a luxury hotel and casino.... WRONG! First off before i even checked in I had employees asking me to put deposits for my next years trip... While my bags are still in my hand before I even check in! Before I made the trip I payed allll fees so I wouldn't have to be hassled with a bill before I even get to my room. The lovely front deal clerk didn't even check to see if I payed because she told me I had a remaining balance of 60.00$. I get the floor manager Gerardo, who explains she messed up and that I did intact pay the fee. I decided to stay at the Luxor only because they had a deal on their rooms. The first day I check in I put the do not disturb sign on the front door and go to take a shower... Not 30 minutes into my super I got a knock at the door. I said one minuet as I dressed myself but the employe let himself in anyways. Once he saw me half naked he said sorry and asked when my check out was...... Let that slide off my shoulders. Next day, same thing happens with house keeping.... Next day, again. Literally three times I get my privacy ignored. So after being a good guest and ignoring these  incidences, I go to find a manager and what does he say?? "You know that's so rude of my employees. But what do you want." I told him I want my privacy and that I shouldn't have to ask for anything! He chuckled and said "you know, I turned 21 a few times myself...." His name was kelvin or Kevin.. . . Bottom line is, this is a cheap hotel with no idea of what customer service is. I let multiple problems slide by me and when I finally tried to explain what happens to a manager, they smile and say have a great day. I will be staying at the bellagio next year.
Suxor.  1st time to Vegas ended up staying at the Luxor. Place is cheap and keep that in mine, service at tables is slow, room service is slow to bring and pick up your stuff. . . To top it off made the rookie mistake of leaving 200 in chips on my nightstand when we went to breakfast.....needless to stay the maid took the chips. She took my 200 and did a shitty job cleaning our place. . . Talked to someone at the front desk about the theft and it seems the policy for the Suxor is "I understand and I am sorry sir, but there is nothing I can do". . This place SUX
