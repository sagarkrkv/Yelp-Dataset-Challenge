Service was ok.  Food was like rating at Dennys.  I was referred to this restaurant by the valet at LVH.  I should have known...  Ordered a steak with veggies.  Steak was flat. No seasoning.  I had to dump a lot of salt to make it passable.  a ribeye steak.  Vegetables were frozen, microwaved....even  a soda was $3.00. Do yourself a favor.  Go to Dennys, it would be less expensive and better.
Breakfast before going to convention Center . Good hearty breakfast. I had hash scramble with a spicy kieblasa type sausage in it with onions and peppers. More food than I can eat which says a ton.
I don't see what the hype is about this place. Yes, their portions are huge and the decoration is very unique, but so is every other restaurant in Las Vegas.. . I think I just ordered the wrong dish though. I ate the french toast collage because I wanted a combination of sweet and savery. The french toast was just okay and I did not like the sausages at all. The bacon and eggs were perfect, though. I also tasted my mom's crab egg's benedict. They were really fishy, but the holondaise sauce was delicious. Next time I will try the corned beef hash. They come highly recommended by my father.
Yelp states "Vegetarians go nuts for this place!" but as a longtime vegetarian that finally made it to The Peppermill for lunch last Friday, I found that the menu did NOT offer many vegetarian choices at all.. . Many places these days that have a selection of different types of burgers will also have a veggie-burger option, yet Peppermill does not.   Likewise, looking through the rest of the menu, there really weren't many options unless I wanted breakfast.. . I ended up ordering nachos.  They were great, but not exactly what I'd want as my sole item for lunch.. . Our waitress was OK, but seemed annoyed or distracted each time she stopped by our table.. .   So even though the Peppermill's menu doesn't thrill me, I actually like the place & will be back.  Why?   I really liked the interior design and atmosphere, and that the place is open 24/7.  Even at Noon on a Friday, the people-watching was fantastic, and I expect it's even more of a human zoo late at night/early in the morning, most of the clientele appearing to be locals.. . I'll be back, but due to their limited vegetarian options, I either need to be hungry for breakfast, or not very hungry at all.  I won't go between midnight & 8AM until I'm current on all my vaccinations...
Terrible service and terrible nachos.. large portion..didn't matter..took a couple no bites and left the rest for the dumpster divers
We had our first visit to Peppermill on 2/7/14. Good service and good food. I ordered the country ham breakfast and hubby had an omelette. Both were excellent but way too much. Can't wait to go back.
We love the peppermill!!! Quick service,great food,large portions and we love the amazing staff!! We were greeted by LARZ the host- whom which we believe should be promoted to manager and tells us "there appetizers are gangster". We had a shy but willing to take one for the team server Yancyyyy! Who we convinced to pose in our complimentary group photo! We love Mary the manager- she coo too! Maryyyyy we will see you tonight!!! Go to the peppermill and get your experience!
You must go here when you visit Vegas!  I found this place after reading reviews. Went for breakfast & it was the best meal we had on our trip.  The portions are huge! More than a person can eat in a sitting.  It was a great value.  The waitresses were great. We enjoyed the free photo post card too.  Parking in their lot is easy too.
If youcome to Vegas, you should have either breakfast, lunch or dinner at least once on your trip.  I'm a regular and have tried just about everything (except red meat) and it's all good.  You should have a  beer and appetizer in the Fireside Lounge, then have your meal in the dining room, Trust me, it's worth it.. . The french fries might be the best in town.  Salads are huge!  Everything is huge!. . Think the Cheese Cake Factory times 10.  Smaller menu, but has everything you could think of.. . I am yet to have a bad dish here.. . PS For fun, get the fruit dish or the banana split, you will have the greatest time ever!. . SECRET: If you get there and there is a huge line, go all the way in and check the bar in front of the cook station, if there are seats open, you can skip the wait!
Coffee shop with nightclub-like atmosphere. Most romantic bar in town. Always crowded, never had a bad meal there yet.
Came here for lunch. Was greeted and seated promptly. Everyone was extremely warm & friendly. Our waitress was fantastic! Wish I remembered her name. The food was fresh & good. Also didn't take too long despite the place being full. My favorite thing about this place was the decor! Very fun & authentic old Vegas atmosphere. Love coming at night as the fire pits are lit. Love this place.
The pepper mill is a classic. It's definitely a good spot to check out on the late night in vegas. I don't think it's the type of place you go before you go out for a nice night. They have all types of good variety food. The food is perfect cure for hang overs or a solid breakfast. I recommend it after a loooonnnngggg night out!
This place as been a family staple for over 25 years. As a child I looked forward to coming here on our vacations to LV and now as an adult the I still look forward to coming here! The spinach salad is incredible and is definitely shareable. The breakfast menu has your standard items so you can't go wrong if you have kids!
Visiting Vegas again on business, left me staying at the Hilton on the North end of the strip across from Circus X2. What I didn't foresee was a Hilton, on the strip, with NO bar and NO restaurant. No problem, the Peppermill is just down the street. . . My coworker and I drive there to find a mostly empty parking lot, which made us think the place may be low on the popularity scale. However, in Vegas a lot if people walk the strip and inside, the place was full. . . I ordered the chicken and red pepper pasta. This dish was recommended by two employees.   I found this dish to be very run-of-the-mill.  . . The cream cheese stuffed chicken was not outstanding. The cream cheese adversely affected the consistency and "bite" of the chicken while I found the red pepper cream sauce to be rather one-dimensional. . . The bruschetta appetizer and mixed drinks were very good. . . The service was very good and kind of made up for the rather average food offering.. . Pros: good service, unusual decor and setting, made up for entree.. . Cons: entree a little sub-par
Ate a late breakfast here. We had to wait about 15 minutes. Our service was good as they were covered up.. The ONLY negative, if you can call it that was the size of the orders. The prices were high, but not considering the size. I had an omelet that must have had 3-4 eggs plus all the ingredients.. Sarah had 3 Hugh pancakes, 3 eggs, bacon and sausage.. Everything tasted great, but neither of us could eat half of it.. Next time we will share or find smaller items to order.. I would eat here again if ever in Vegas again.
I went here while staying in Vegas. My party had 11 people and they accommodated us quite well. We only waited 10 minutes or less to be seated. The decor is super fun: neon lights, bright colors, etc. It has personality, for sure! Most of my group came for the country fried steak. I had the steak and eggs--it was good! My steak was cooked a perfect medium, as requested. It came with three eggs cooked however you'd like, hash browns, and toast/muffin/etc.  We were checked on throughout the meal and got all we needed. I would come back!
Five stars for all the years of great memories...this is the place to go if you want a taste of Vegas as it once was...the restaurant has been my go to spot since I was a toddler, good solid food, big portions, friendly and fast service, fun Vegas style sparkly interior...the lounge with their indoor fire pit, great cocktails, old school videos,friendly cocktail dress wearing servers, and if your lucky fellow customers that walked right out of a mob movie with their lovely ladies, all make for one great experience that is not to be missed ; }
We ended up at this restaurant because someone on my daughters cheer team had planned a team dinner. This place is kind of famous as it has been shown in several movies and that is about the only thing good I can say about it. Looking at the menu they have a $28.00 dollar porterhouse steak. At 28.00 dollars I figured that it would be of reasonable quality even though we where at what appeared to be a fancy coffee shop, so I ordered the steak and was very disappointed with the quality. It was an 1/8 of an inch thick! Heck, I have had better breakfast steaks and Denny's! The sauteed mushrooms tasted terrible. Basically they were canned mushrooms thrown in oil and warmed up. No flavor what so ever. The baked potato was even bad. It was over cooked and damp tasting like it had been sitting in a steam oven all day. This restaurant managed to strike out on all 3 items that I ordered. Even the drink that I ordered was flat and had no carbonation. I would stay away from this place if you like flavor.
I chose this restaurant by previous reviews, and a long time resident of Las Vegas. The food was very good and even when I had to return something they were more than eager and friendly about fixing the problem. . The next table had pancakes and the pancake was as big as the plate which was huge. The service was spot on, and the price was equally as pleasing.. . Would definitely eat here again if I was in Vegas.
We waited 25 minutes for a table and is worth every minute!they make u feel comfortable while your waiting.u can gamble n have a drink while you wait and they announce it over the loud speaker.it was cool!and nice!the french toast was amazing and the bavon melted on your mouth.it was soooo yummy!there portions are huge!i will come back to the peppermill  everytime im here for sure!
We came here for a good inexpensive breakfast & that is exactly what we got. They have big portions. So sharing is good if u don't want to be stuffed. We had the cheese omelette w/hash browns & a pancake. It was all great, the hash browns are outstanding, taste homemade. The pancake is enormous, light & fluffy but thick @ the same time. All in all a good breakfast @ a great price.
I used to come here all the time when I was a kid.  It was always good.  After years and years I came back, it is super close and convenient.  It's like I walked into the twilight zone. Very purple.  I think the servers outfits are awesome. I really like the long velvet gowns the cocktail servers wear. The price seemed high for this place.  Fettuccine Alfredo $20.  We decided to share and got the nachos as starters.  The food arrived and we were shocked, the portions were huge!  We invited two more friends. The nachos were basic, made with real cheese, olives, jalapenos. It also came with a side of beans and the canned type cheese mixed together.  I probably would not order it again.  The fettuccine was surprisingly good.  Added a little pepper then it was better.   It also came with a Caesar salad which was fine and two pieces  of garlic bread.  The 4 of us didn't even finish all the food!  At the end we waited forever not realizing we pay at the front. The server never mentioned it.  I took a peek at the bar and it looked really cozy with a fire pit.  Seems like a cool place to have a drink.
This is a diner style restaurant. Super food, huge portions, great service. It's not the cheapest place you can go but the protons are so big that they compensate for the price.
