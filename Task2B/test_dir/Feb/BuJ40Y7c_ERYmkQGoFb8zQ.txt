This place should have been knocked down to make room for a real resort. It's half ass in almost every way. The casino stinks like perfume and cigarettes mixed together and none of the 3 restaurants are open after 9pm. The one restraint that is open only serves cold food after 10pm and that is just ridiculous in Vegas. It's not a real resort and can't compete with its neighbors.
It may have been renovated but it's still curiously 1970's in decor and ambiance. My inexpensive room was extremely comfortable for the two nights that I spent in Las Vegas but a resort fee when the pools were seasonally closed is a rip-off.  I was upgraded to a room in the Club Tower without asking, and which I suspect may not appeal to a majority of their guests since it's a long way from the lobby. I didn't mind the exercise and my room was clean and very comfortable. Unusually, I got a much better room price from a travel site than the hotel would offer me, even after I pointed this out to them, There's not much in the way of customer service here so I'd only recommend the New Tropicana if you get a very good deal on the room rate. You won't want to eat here as the restaurants aren't worth patronizing, particularly when there are so many alternatives to try.
Holy fuck where do I start???. 01. Smelly.. 02. Fugly rooms.. 03. Room Service Sucks.. 04. A bit on the dirty side.. 05. Called 4 times for room service no shows.. 06.

Puta madre don't come here this place vale pito.. 10. Don't do it run from this place, dont truat this place
I stayed here the second time for the sin city shootout softball tournament in January.  This was my second time. . . Last year I had no problems, but this year I was assigned to the second floor near the front entrance.  The first shower I took, the water pressure was strong coming out of the tub, but when switched to the shower, the water pressure barely came out.  I called the front desk and they transferred me to housekeeping.   Then a maintenance worker came into the room to replace the air filter.  He said he knew nothing about the shower head being broken.  I asked him to fix it, but he said he was only doing air filter replacements.  He told me to call back to the front desk.  . . This continued 3 more times from Thursday and Friday.  Finally I asked to be moved to a different room.  Front desk told me they were sold out at my room rate and if I wanted to move, I would have to pay the difference.  Totally terrible customer service.  I ended up showering in my neighbor's room for the rest of my stay.  . . So when I got home, I completed the survey they emailed me.  I received an email response from Shelby Masacek on 1-24-2014 apologizing and asking me to personally call him or her when planning my next visit.  Really??  That is your response??  OK, that won't happen because I will NEVER stay there again.  . . #1, being all defensive about the shower head.  I mean really, it is a $15 shower head.  Did they expect me to go to home depot and buy it myself?  If they are willing to loose a returning customer over a $15 shower head, then what else can happen?  . . #2, Refusing to move me.  Speaks for itself.  . . #3, There are so many customer service problems here with the staff, that I don't feel it will change or that this is an isolated incident.  The wifi also was on and off.  I didnt mention that because I spent all my time showering in my neighbors room. . . #4  Shining Light:  I ate a few times at the cafe.  Totally delicious and the staff there were amazing.  Even after the parties let out, they were swamped but they did an incredible job.   That restaurant GM should take over the entire hotel if they want to save it.  . . Finally, Guests expect to be pampered in Vegas, not put on the defensive or be expected to solve customer service problems.  The New Tropicana really fell short of my expectations.
This hotel has some of the worst customer service I have seen in Vegas.. . I arrived at the hotel at 9pm on a Friday.  There were 2 parties ahead of me and 2 people working behind the counter.  There were also 2 managerial types standing behind the counter having a private discussion.  It took 30 minutes for me to get up the counter to begin checking in.  Never did any one of the 4 people smile, say hello, or say sorry for the wait.  The worker who finally checked me in was rude, spoke broken English, and made me feel like I was putting her out.  I was also informed I needed to pay a $20/day resort fee.  I assure you the Tropicana is NOT a resort and I still have no clue what the fee covers since its advertised as free parking and you have to PAY FOR WIFI.. . I finally arrived in my room to find it pretty decent except for a stench coming from the desk area where the guests before me had left food trash and had not been emptied.    Yum.  The bathroom was ok except the fixtures and door are all outdated and work out.  The  towels had been washed so many times there were little wear holes in most of them.  The TV offers about 10 channels that are Spanish or sports.  . . The hotel itself is reminiscent of a prison, all white plain tall buildings.  The casino has carpet that is probably still left over from 1980.  You can tell they have tried to dump some money into the main casino, but its definitely a failure.  The type of people you see in the casino and around the hotel are leaving much to be desired.. . Every employee I saw looked unhappy, bored, and disgruntled.  I figured maybe this was typical Vegas as they are trapped inside a casino all day, but after visiting several other hotels onmy trip  the "new" Tropicana definitely takes the cake for subpar customer service skills.. . Compared to other hotels and prices I would say that this hotel and service is worth about $40/night.  If you are paying any more than that, do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere.
The remodel is on point. Favorite hotel by far. Loved the staff and that free cookie was the bees knees. I can't wait to stay again.
I like the Tropicana. I like the smell they pump in this casino. I like that it is light and bright inside. Despite this, I don't think I would stay there... it is so far from the central strip. Anyway, a friend and I went here to play in the middle of the day on a Saturday. We were approached to open a player's club card and their card is decent, especially if you plan on gambling a lot (get free play for half of your losses over 20$...not bad). My problem was the waitress service. We sat at their machines forever... the waitress came once... we tipped...not sure why we got ignored after that. The drinks were good too, we would have stayed there and played if they had the waitress come around consistently. Unfortunately, after playing for 20-30 minutes with no attention, we decided to move on. Up your game Tropicana!
As Hilton Diamond members, we try to stay at Hiltons whenever possible, but our last experience at the HiltonElara in Las Vegas was underwhelming at best. One of the main reasons I didn't love the Elara was because we received essentially no Hilton perks to make it any more desirable than other properties on the strip. So when we realized the Tropicana was now a Double Tree property and recently renovated, we were excited to give it a try, although I was a bit hesitant to stay that far south on the Strip. We booked the lowest level king size bed room using Hilton points.. . Our cross-country flight arrived around 9am on a Friday morning, and we were pleasantly surprised with the short (ie, inexpensive) cab ride from the airport. We headed directly to the Diamond VIP check-in lounge, hoping for a miracle that a room would be ready for us. Being on East coast time, we were ready for a nap! Well, it was our lucky day because not only did they have a room ready for us, but we were upgraded to a King Suite on the 19th floor of the Club Tower! On a weekend stay! I was very impressed. The Club Tower is situated in the back near the convention center, so it is a little bit of a walk, but it was shorter than a lot of the other resorts on the strip.. . The room was really nice and spacious, with a separate sitting room with a couch, tv, and counter seating area with a fridge and a Keurig coffee maker (no sink though). The bedroom was quite spacious with another flat screen tv, large closet, and a very comfortable bed. Around the corner were 2 sinks with lots of counter space, and then a rather small room that housed the toilet and glass-door shower. The lighting in the shower area was very dark and there was no option to just turn on the light without the fan which I found annoying. Everything was very clean and the two main rooms were very light and airy. Unfortunately our view of the airport runway was less than desirable.. . One of the things I found annoying about the Hilton Elara was that there was no complimentary breakfast for HHonors members, because honestly, it saves us a lot of money on vacation. So I was happy to hear that we would receive a continental breakfast at the Tropicana. Well, it was better than Elara in that I received something to eat for free. However, it was in a dingy food court where you had to stand in a long line with exactly one cashier, who would have you pick 3 items from the continental breakfast list. No hot items were included, not even a hard boiled egg. So for 3 days I had a coffee, a hard bagel, and a yogurt. The fourth day, I couldn't take it anymore and begged my husband to take me to the Beach Cafe for their breakfast buffet even if we had to pay. It was so much better, with a made to order omelet station, plenty of other options including smoked salmon and plenty of fruit. They even made me a hard boiled egg. I wish that maybe this buffet could be an option to upgrade for $10 from the continental breakfast for Hilton members like I've seen at MANY other Hilton properties. It would have made my mornings so much more pleasant.. . Speaking of food, we also ate lunch in the Beach Cafe on the day of our arrival and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the service. We also had dinner one night at Bacio, the Italian restaurant on property, and greatly enjoyed that as well. There are so many great places to eat in Vegas but it was nice to have a few different options right on site when we didn't feel like going very far.. . The casino was smaller than most, but smelled nice and fresh and felt less dark and imposing than most other places on the strip. The Tropicana also has a comedy club called the Laugh Factory, which you can get tickets for 2-for-1 if you join their players club. Something different to do! The location of the Tropicana on the strip was actually great- you are on the same corner as MGM, NYNY, and Excalibur, so you can walk to Excalibur quickly and take the tram down to Mandalay Bay, or take the monorail from MGM and go all the way north on the strip.. . All in all, we were pleasantly surprised with the Tropicana and would definitely consider it for our next Vegas trip. I just hope they upgrade the HHonors breakfast options so I don't have to stand in line for a yucky bagel next time!
This casino and hotel has been completely re-done in the last year or two. Its very nice inside and out. The rooms are clean and bright and the staff is very friendly. I have stayed here the last two winters and the COMPS are great! If you stop in try to say hello to either Gwen or Nellie, who both work the front desk, and are very helpful! I will definitely be back!! The Laugh Factory Comedy Club, located inside the casino, is also lots of fun!!!
The renovated hotel was very pretty and comfortable. Clean and great service. Only bad thing is walking all the way to the back of the hotel to get to your room. I dont mind walking and "exercising" but that's not what I want to do when I am on vacation and tired at night from walking all day. Overall it was fine.
Stayed here the weekend before Halloween. The hotel is really nice on the inside I had no wait for check-in due to the fact that I checked in early and I mean EARLY (10:30am) luckily they had a room available for early check-in. . . Get to the room it was HUGE everything was clean and I had a nice view  through the shutters.... Yeah they were wood grain shutters. Beds were comfy everything was pretty clean. I think they may want to look into their housekeeping because I showered and left at around 9am to go gamble and came back around 2pm and my bed was not made and the towels were not replaced. I've been to Vegas plenty times and sometimes the housekeeping wakes ME up  in the mornings lol I stayed here 3 nights and that exact scenario happened twice. . I enjoyed my stay, great location, not very busy so it wasn't crowded.
I can only review the casino.. The outside of the hotel is rather dismal,  it looks like a shroud has been placed over it, or they never finished painting and just have the primer done.  The windows appear covered and it gives the place a rather creepy look.. I never went in to the casino before this visit because the exterior is so unappealing.. Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised by a clean, bright, well maintained and  cheerful environment.. The craps table crew are professional, friendly, fun and very nice.. (They made it fun to lose money!)  . The slots machines are fun, but they need to loosen them up a bit.. Everyone we encountered was friendly and professional.  Courtesy is lacking in so many professions.  It was refreshing to see the staff overall was courteous and respectful.  It must speak higher up to hiring and training.
