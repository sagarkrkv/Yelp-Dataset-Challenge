Ok. The cocktail servers will try and get you drunk. Even if you don't order any alcoholic beverages. . . I was at the blackjack table and I ordered a SOBE Energy drink. The server came back with a SOBE & VODKA. I took a sip and said, "whoa, this has alcohol in it" She said, "No it doesn't. I saw the bartender pour it in the glass from the can." I gave the drink to my friend to try and he definitely agreed there was alcohol in it. . . I wouldn't make such a big deal out of this but being that I have been sober for over 2 years, it's a big deal to me. The servers should be extra careful who they are serving alcohol to. . . Nice try Hunty but your little plot of trying to get me to drink didn't work. Good luck next time!
This was my second time staying here. Though the main entrance and our rooms smelled like apples and cigarette, something about this place is so cool. The staff is nice. This place is truly good if you are on a budget but don't want to stay in a dump...I.e. Circus circus. I recommend staying here.
This was my first time in Vegas, and my boyfriend and I decided to stay at the New York-New York hotel and casino. I had a great experience here. The beds were so comfortable, our room was nice and clean, and most workers there were friendly. We stayed in the park avenue room with a king bed. We ended up getting a room on the 16th floor of the New York tower building and we had a pretty nice view from there, it was awesome. The only thing is that I wish the rooms had a refrigerator. We saved ourselves some money by getting the room with a promotion code from smartervegas.com; it came with two free tickets for the roller coaster ride (which was so much fun) and a $50 worth of drinks at the hotel. We didn't gamble, but we did sit down at the center bar to have our $50 dollar worth of drinks (and more) hehe. Drinks were good and strong too. I would definitely stay here again.
I have to say, for $50 a night I am really pleased. It's not super high end like the Bellagio but the price is right and it's a fun place to stay. The location on the Strip is perfect. We had a car but was in a good location for walking all over. I love the goofyfake NYC scenes in the casino. Drinks at the slots were good and generous. Chin Chin and Gonzales y Gonzales are both good dinner bets.. . My only grumps are:. 1. The hike to our room from the elevator was ridiculous. I would have love to have gone back and forth to the room more but it was in Timbuktu. . 2. There were a lot of dings on the furniture and the rooms just weren't quite to the resort standard of upkeep. With that said they were pretty clean.
I really enjoyed my stay here. I checked in at about 3 pm on a Friday. No wait. The staff was really friendly and helpful. . . My room was very nice. A definite step up from the near by Excalibur and Luxor. Clean, nice view, and very spacious. There was even an old school view finder with film of what the front will look like after the update in the front. . . Loved the casino, except for the snail pace cocktail service. You really have to look out for the waitress and catch her attention. . . tl;dr - All in all, I liked what this hotel had to offer. Nice room, nice casino, nice restaurants.
Having stayed here previously with great experiences I booked a room for our anniversary. At arrival there was quite the line with only 3 employee's working. I found this strange because it was the first hour of check-in. After finally getting checked in we get to the room and my wife started to take a shower so we could go out for the evening. About 5 minutes into the shower the water stops. I call down to the front desk to find out what was going on since my wife was covered in soap. The front desk person was extremely rude for no reason telling me that it's a big hotel and things go wrong. . . I explained that I was just trying to get an estimate on time so my wife could finish her shower. The front desk finally agrees to bring a couple bottles of water so she can at least get the soap off. 45 minutes later we finally get a knock on the door and was handed 2 8oz bottles of water. They said that's all they can give and we'd have to make it work.. . Also hotel is located in the sightseeing helicopter flight path resulting in a flyby every 5 minutes or so and the windows are not very sound proof. . . I understand that things break down from time to time but the bad customer service is unacceptable. Will not be staying at NYNY again.
Looooved getting my booze on here when I was in Vegas last! Really quick and attentive waitresses. Tip them well and they take GREAT care of you!
First time staying here and it seems a bit dingy and not well kept here. TV channels were pixelated because of overload in the network. Not the greatest but again I was expecting anything relatively close to a 5 star quality services here.
This is a really fun hotel. I've been coming here since they opened over a decade ago. The roller coaster is still a blast to ride and not usually much of a line. You get to it through the arcade which has all the newest and fun arcade games. It's a great place for kids to hang out while adults do casino stuff. Rooms could definitely use some updating. Has a little to much of a motel feel when it comes to bedding, towels, etc... The Piano bar at time Square is always a blast to hang out at. good food court with many options and a tiny sports book for placing bets on the games.
On our Vegas stay we decided to change hotels and casinos each of the 5 days here. NY NY is by far the best hotel. We upgraded to a King Spa room with whirlpool tub. Extremely worth every cent. Huge room super clean and quiet.  I think this may turn in to our main stay hotel.
This hotel is decent -- no frills, but works for the price you pay (which isn't much through MLife, which is how I booked it).  I didnt care for the room decor very much -- it looked like a generic hotel room and was rather dark and dingy.  It was comfortable though, if not particularly spacious.  What I do like about this hotel is all the food options.  They have almost every type of food imaginable and at all price ranges. You don't have to leave the hotel to find something yummy to eat, and I especially liked the crepes place.  Another restaurant that stood out was Gonzalez y Gonzalez -- they serve huge, delicious flavored margarita's here for a great price and really yummy taquitos. A great value on the strip especially.  I wouldn't mind staying here again, just because it's cheap and I don't have to kill my feet walking out of the hotel to find affordable food options.
If the MGM Grand across the street is Manhattan, this place is New Jersey.  The staff all seem to feel that it is a HUGE imposition to wait on customers.  Internet service is included in a $20 day "resort fee" and is every bit as fast as the dial-up service I had 15 years ago.  Television service is iffy, often pixelating or blinking on and off.  . . The rooms are all rather boring; they don't say "Las Vegas Strip," they say "That Comfort Inn Out By the Interstate."  . . If you step outside, expect to be accosted by hustlers, time share scammers, homeless people, whores, and more.  T
Love Love Love!. . I was recently here with my family for 4 nights for my daughter's national cheerleading competition at another casino. I am so happy we decided to stay here! We booked a Madison Avenue room with 2 queen beds. About 2 weeks prior to my trip I was offered to upgrade to a "premium view room" for another $8 a night, so I figured what the heck. I am so glad I did. The room was big and spacious seeing how we had a corner room with views on 2 sides. . . No problems at all checking in, it was fast and easy. The beds were so comfortable my husband and I actually slept all night each night we were there. The room was quiet, I could only hear other showers in the mornings but that wasn't until about 10am or so. The shower/tub combo was great with a deep tub that was great to soak in after those long walks. . . My only complaint would be the door going in and out of the room. There is a door thingy (yes, the technical term for it :) at the top of the door that slowed the door down so much (so it doesn't slam) that you have to stand there and wait for it or try to pull it closed, but then it doesn't close right as the top of the door hits the frame. So, every time you open the door you have to wait to make sure it closes before you go walking off. . . But, really....that's such a minor little thing! I really loved staying here and with my family, New York New York made us all feel so comfortable giving we had to bring kids to LV. I will definitely be coming back as we visit LV 3-4 times a year and I would absolutely recommend this hotel/casino to anyone
