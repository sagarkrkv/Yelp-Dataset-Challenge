We received ticket for the show thru our hotel, the Bellagio, and wasn't sure it was going to be such a great show. We were wrong. The show and staff were great! I would like to especially thank Adnan for being one of the best hosts/staff members we have meet with in Las Vegas. Finding out we were there for my sisters wedding, Adnan, gratefully upgraded our seats. This was so nice of the team members and it made the show even better. I will be recommending Zumanity to my friends and family. Thank you Zumanity & Adnan.
OH EM GEE!  What a show!  A very, VERY sensual show, without being sexual.  This is a show you DO NOT want to take your parents to.  It would be a better idea to purchase tickets for them and have them go without you.
Very impressive acrobatics.  Very funny characters.    Very sexy and sometimes raunchy comedy.  They have a live band and singers who sing each of the songs.  Very cool.  Not good for kids and probably wouldn't' recommend it for church goers either.
If you've never been to a Cirque show, you might think Zumanity is awesome. But if you've been to some of their other productions (as I have), you'll probably find Zumanity to be pretty tame as an acrobatic display. Purely in acrobatic terms, this is a 2 star performance.. . As for the "sexiness" and entertainment value of the show, there's room for debate.. . - If you like loud, over-the-top vocals that distract from the action on the stage, you'll probably like this show (Christina Aguilera fans will love the music I think).. . - If you think obvious displays of sexuality (complete with hip thrusting) are "romantic" or "sexy," you'll like this show.. . - If you aren't at all disturbed by sexual violence, you'll probably like the show.. . While I did appreciate the comedy routines (admittedly raunchy), the drag queen host, and the skill of the acrobats, I found the show to be a disappointment. . . In an effort to add some sex appeal, Zumanity under-achieves in all aspects. It's not as fun as a traditional burlesque show, not as awe-inspiring as a typical Cirque performance, and not at all romantic.. . If you can get a deal on the tickets, it's not a bad way to kill 2 hours. But if you're choosing between Zumanity and something else similarly priced...something else will almost certainly be better.
Don't waste your time going to this show. For the price, I was expecting so much more. It was distasteful & not entertaining at all. Halfway through, i was bored & wishing I was somewhere else. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews that were posted. What a joke...
Loved the show. The wife and I found it fun entertaining and quit hilarious. This is one of those shows that are fun to watch regardless of the seats you purchase. Beware the front row, they will pull you into the show.
I had been looking forward to this show for about 3 years! For some reason, every time I've been to Vegas in the past 3 years (About 4 times), Zumanity was on hiatus (holiday weekends off, maybe?). Anyways, after all that hype, I was a little disappointed.. . Highlight:. - Edie the drag queen host was effing hilarious and was great at improv with people in the crowd. - The Sex Therapist Couple: the woman was hilarious! Especially her "Scotch baggies" skit. I was laughing so hard!. . Low Light:. - Racist black people dancing like animals with bongo music playing. Wtf? There were no other race-related/stereotypical dances that happened!. - If you don't sit at stage-level, you might as well not go. My husband and I sat on balcony level because we heard the cast brings people on stage and wanted to avoid that at all costs. However, we were penalized seeing only about 60% of the impromptu stuff with the crowd in the beginning and at random times during the show. - The show wasn't that sexy! It was definitely more of a scantily-clad circus than anything else. . Unforgettable Moment:. - The bondage skit had everyone in the entire theater holding their breath. It was so sexually-charged! . . My recommendation:. Go see them with a comp ticket, travel deal, or with the savings they are offering with this being their 10th year anniversary
Not for the conservative! Nudity, thongs, fishnets, chocolate covered strawberries, and boobies!! they put sex OUT there and IN your face. In a tasteful and at times not tasteful way. The acrobatics were fun. There was no storyline, just different "episodes." My boyfriend and I went to it and enjoyed it. The cast makes sure the whole crowd feels involved, so be prepared to get called on stage or interact with the cast if you're in the bottom seating section. We had a good time with the show! There are others I'd recommend though if you are looking for a story or more amazing acrobatic feats: such as O or Ka.
Pros:. Great hostess. small, intimate theater. terrific audience participation. . Cons:. Minimal cirque du soleil type acts. "sexy" show? meh, not so much-more of a variety act
Would I pay full price for this show? No. . . But, I do have to admit, it was a very entertaining show. Lots of awkward moments that will get you out of your shell and laughing, interesting interactions with the audience (we were seated pretty close to the stage so thankfully we didn't get chosen to participate in the acts but if you don't want to, you can kindly reject their offer). . . Less acrobatic acts than the other cirques as others had mentioned, but I thought it was still a good enough amount. I wish it had a little more of a storyline though because it was just a random bunch of acts being performed all at once and it was hard to focus my attention on anything. . . There was a woman seated behind bf and I and she was so offended by the acts/nudity that she stormed out very loudly. How rude. People should definitely look at the ads and reviews before blindly jumping into this show though. And absolutely, NOT a family show! Unless you're one of those types of family.. i suppose. No intermission so 1.5 hour straight through of sexual humor ! . . Overall, would I watch it again? Probably not. But it was definitely worth a try!
