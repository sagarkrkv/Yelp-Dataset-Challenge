So I always wanted to drink out a boot and what better place to do it than this place. Now im not an avid bear drinker but I must aay that this ber is good , I started with a dark brew in my boot and the party began , I made sure to turn my boot to advoid the bubble ehen drinking, music was entertaining and I even participated in the beer drinking contest but lost, now onto the food potato soup was great, I got the HB plate was ok did like one of the meats on it, overall good atmosphere u will have fun and surrly get drunk here, beware of getying spanked with the shot paddle lol
Great beers, some of zee greatest beers in all of zee world. They even have a boot you can drink out of. The food is less than mediocre. I orders the steak to be cooked medium, it was well done. It tasted like ass and trust when I say, I KNOW what ass tastes like.
Love, love, love this place!!!. . We found it for our wedding reception, so we decided to make a special trip and try it out beforehand (our wedding is in Oct 2014.) . . I was a little worried about sound and saltiness from other reviews but neither were an issue. The entertainment was perfect and perfect volume. We tried 6-7 different dishes and fell in love with all of them (with the exception of the pot roast which was a little tough, but when we asked to sample some pork roast because we were trying to decide buffet options, the chef complied and it was amazing!). . The server, Olga?, was awesome! We had a couple of our party paddled for ordering shots and it was so much fun! The entire hall gets in on the fun! (And it was kind of nice that they don't do the whole...we're gonna get hot women to do paddling...it's normal servers with an awesome attitude!). . My fiancee loved it so much, he's already declared that for ALL our annerversaries in the future, we'll be revisiting. . . Can't wait to party it up in October!!!
I'm from Germany, it is a littlebit of hometown there. And a special experience - you must have! :). German food, german music, german beer,... - no one other can offer that feelingin Vegas. . It's more expensive than in Germany and during the week they shut the door at 11 pm :(
fun!!!!. the food is good, lots of choices too. service is great! fun music and dancing. . the one thing that bugged us was a 3% charge for paying with credit card. they dont advise you of this til the end. kind of an  outdated practice,  and lets you leave with a bit of a sour taste after a fun experience. you would think that an establishment such as this can afford the 3% fee from the banks.
We used to come here regularly, but this place has gone downhill since our last visit.  Of course, we enjoyed the German beer.  The servers did a fair job but were a bit slow.  The food was OK, not great but worthy of returning.  Cafe Berlin is much better.. . One main reason why will be writing this place off: when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  According to Visa's rules this is supposed to be displayed at the entrance and printed on each Receipt.  I didn't notice anything at the entrance and it definitely isn't on the receipt.   . . So, this *very smart* businessman just lost regular customers, plus us referring Las Vegas visitors here, over about a $5 decision.  Idiot--you'll make that up with just one more beer sale to me.. . Good bye.
Great German food in an exact replica of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany.
We lived in Augsburg for 2+ years (near Munich) and got to the 'real' Hofbrauhaus more than a few times. The Vegas version is near perfect in every way. Food, atmosphere, service, entertainment - GREAT!
Sausage and beer are good. Avoid the schnitzel, unless you have a hankering for shoe leather. Toughest piece of meat ever.
A little on the expensive side, but tastes just like the food I had growing up!  Real fun when you go and there is live music.  Service is always exceptional!  We would go more often if the prices were just a bit lower.
Had lunch there today: the wurst platter was wonderful, the wait staff was friendly (no Teutonic frowns) and the German beer was great!
I just left here. Tonight is my 30th birthday and although the food was great, the service is what I have come to expect from Vegas, absolute shit.  Our server, "one of their best" didn't give a flying fuck about our table.  I don't need a candle or a birthday song, but embarrass my family and I will be compelled to call you out. The band was great too but our blonde server never smiled once and made my family, who tried so hard to give me a good time, feel like assholes... . Thanks and happy birthday to me!
I really loved the atmosphere stepping into this place. I have been learning German and what better way to brush up on my singing skills than visiting a German restaurant hall? The service was good but the real take home of the night was the Hefeweizen which was great. The potato soup, pretzels, and brats were tasty although the pretzels were a bit on the salty side for my taste. I was really looking forward to enjoying a loud atmosphere with singing and this place did not disappoint!
