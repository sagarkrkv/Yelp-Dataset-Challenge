If you are ever in Tempe, AZ find your way over here. The food is American/Bar food but it is a huge step above your average American/Bar food. We sampled the entire menu and everything was great. The batter for the fish and chicken is straight amazing. The beer bread they use on the wraps is simply great. The wings are top notch. See what I mean, doesn't matter what you order. Then to compliment all the great food are their tasty home brewed craft beers. They have something for everyone. On the off chance you don't like beer, the Bloody Mary spicy or not is a great alternative. The reason I gave this place the five stars because to round out the total experience is the service. I only rate a place five start as when I receive the total package drink, food, and service. Great place, come on in.
The spicy bloody Mary has a pickle and most of a salad and is close to the best bloody I've ever had. The beer bread is like a tortilla but much more fantastic. Order a flight of beers and you get to taste everything they have for 10 bucks including the seasonals.  We'll be back whenever we're in town.  Also a big plus, it's a Vikings friendly crowd far from the home state. SKOL Vikings.
Absolutely LOVED this place. Great beer, great atmosphere, great bartenders who are knowledgable and actually CARE if you like the beer and what you think of it!!! All of them do. Kiltlifter is awesome!!. We were looking for good beer and not necessarily good food but this place has both. We tried the chicken wings and the pita and spicy hummus. Both were very good. The bartender had asked my husband if he was afraid of spice and my husband told him he likes to hurt when he eats spicy. So the bartender brought us out a habanero sauce that's made in house... you have to ask for it. My husband was delighted. . We will definitely come back! Loved this place on so many levels.
Great beers, great atmosphere, great service.  Just a great place, did I mention this place was pretty great?
A friend who went to school at ASU told me that Four Peaks is on her list to eat at every time she returns to AZ. Since she has well trusted culinary instincts (in my book, at least), I insisted that we try it out the next time I was there...and we have been going every time since!. . I don't like beer (even though I keep trying to convince myself), but will never stop me from coming here! The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich. While the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesn't have a strong beer flavor, I cannot get enough of it! They should cut it up in triangles and serve it as an app!! They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.. . Oh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).. . If you're ever around ASU- and even if you have to drive a half hour (or more) to get here, it is worth it. Sit on the patio to catch some rays while you eat/drink, or in the brewery to admire the beer being made while you guzzle some down yourself....
A good biddy took me here for some beers and lunch.  The beers I had were pretty amazing.  I'm not a huge IPA fan but they have it all.  The Pumpkin Porter was really good.  The food was really good and can't wait to go back next time I visit the Phoenix area.
Amazing location, the building aesthetically looks great, great staff, their appetizer chicken rolls are to die for, love their chicken sandwich and burgers!
I started visiting this awesome place back in 1999. The first stout I ever drank happened here, and it's still my favorite (I'm an official stout guy). . . The place has expanded over the years, but some things have never changed:. . -Great service. -Outstanding beer. -Terrific food. -Fun atmosphere. . My faves are the nachos with chicken and any of their pizzas. As for beers, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the oatmeal stout, it's one of my top 5 beers in the world. Also a big fan of the Kiltlifter, 8th Street Ale, and Hop Knot. . . I now live in San Diego (Suds County USA) with some of the best breweries and beer anywhere, but I still make it a point to stop by Four Peaks every chance I'm back in the valley of the sun.
Four Peaks Tempe is definitley a favorite hangout spot of mine for a few reasons. . . Their beers are really good. Personally, I am a fan of Hefeweizens and Wheat beers--Four Peaks Hefe does not disappoint my tastebuds!!! Always hits the spot. Aside from the beer, their food is great, too. Their Chicken Beer Bread is good, and the patties they use for the burgers are really fat and come out super juicy. YUM. I also recommend going on Sundays for brunch. Their breakfast plates are huge and really good. Never have tried their pizzas, but I've heard good things. . . The atmosphere is great... I do love the beer, but quite honestly, it is the setup of this place that has really stolen my heart. There's a large patio out front and the interior is huge! Really large bar (my favorite place to sit) where service has always been a positive experience. The whole place is really laid back and really just a great place to enjoy good beer with good friends. . . The only negative thing I can say is that parking really stinks... usually you have to parallel park along the street. So it sounds like there should be a lot of space, but since this place always draws a crowd, it's sometimes more of a challenge to find a space than you'd think. . . This place rocks!
Almost two years since my last review at Four Peaks on 8th Street.  We did some Sunday brunch on the patio (One of my favorite things to do this time of year)!. Service was great, as always!  Food was delicious! I had the breakfast Brickhouse burger, perfect for when you can't decide between breakfast or lunch.  The beers were tasty and refreshing as well.  Four Peaks is probably one of my favorite places to go in the valley!. . If you are visiting the Phoenix area or haven't been to Four Peaks yet, just go.. . I will caution that there can be a wait, especially when the weather is good. Parking can be a challenge, but if you are willing to persevere, get that parking space and possibly wait a bit to be seated, you will be handsomely rewarded!. If you love patios, the wait will likely be longer, but the inside seating area is quite expansive if you don't care where you sit.. Lastly, if beers like Miller lite and Bud are in your wheelhouse, then I would suggest this may not be the place for you, unless you're open to trying new things.. . Great place to hang out and relax with friends/family!
This place has a gorgeous patio that I could sit on for hours when the weather is nice. It is also open to all ages so you will see a very good sampling of people (during the day at least). You can bring your babies, your grandma or the chick you met last night here, it's all good. . . The food is alright, better than most bars, not as good as some gastro-pubs. People either love or hate their beer. I'm somewhere in the midde, I like their seasonals the best typically.. . Parking sucks especailly for Tempe where you are not used to having to scrounge for street parking. It is worth the walk and the wait however, when the weather is 80 degrees.
We looooooooooove four peaks! They have an awesome selection of food, the atmosphere is fantastic and the service is awesome! This is one of our favourite places in the valley to go to! Not to mention there beer is tasty!!! :) goooo now you won't be disappointed!!! And eat the beer stout tiramisu!!! It's heaven!!!! Yummmmm
So married with three kids and needed a date night. I really wanted to change things up a bit to keep things fun. My wife and I like many are partial to great beer and great food. Throw a different location on top thats not the usual food chain and sometimes you get lucky. I live in north Phoenix so this was about a 40 to 45 minute drive. Well after all said and done very worth it. Went on a Saturday night and expected a long wait.... I don't even know how long we ended up waiting. That's because we were able to hang out at the bar and try some beers. Next thing you know we were at a table ordering food. Staff was friendly and punctual. Food was out quick and very pleased with the quality. Here are the bads. Parking pretty limited and it's far from our house. My wife was commenting on how she wishes there was one closer. Wants to try more of the food! Me too.
Great brew house. Had the beer tasting, which was delicious. And the spinach and artichoke dip which was also fantastic!! Huge chunks of artichoke and creamy cheese. Seriously, I'm thinking about it right now.
This place rocks! Cade is a great server. Try the Chicken Rolls! Get extra jalapeno sauce!
We all know about the amazing brews, so I'll  defer to others to expound on that aspect. The daily specials never disappoint, but for me the sweet spot is their soups. Consistently delicious, completely house made, original and created daily.
I don't know what you can say that hasn't already been said. Not only is Four Peaks the best local brewery in the Phoenix area but their food is nothing short of outstanding. Whenever I have friends visiting the area this is the one spot I make sure to make them to. It gets a little crowded (rightfully so) which makes parking alittle difficult but you can always find a spot somewhere along the street.
One time a friend and I had to wait 45 minutes before anyone asked me what I would like to eat or drink. It was baffling, like our table was placed just perfectly that we weren't in anyone's zone or someone was just neglecting their duties. It was astounding. We were starving and had a thirst to boot. They were very apologetic when they finally realized we would also like to partake in the foods and beverages that the other patrons partook of. So much so that they comped the entire meal minus drinks. Only time i've ever had a negative experience there after many many visits and it ended up being a good thing in the end cause all I had to do was sit and wait and talk to my friend and they basically paid us in food for doing just that. Easiest 30 or 40 bucks in savings I've ever made! This place is really incredible. The beer is ridiculously good, the food, even better if that's possible. Spinach artichoke dip is a staple of my visits but I've never had anything I didn't like from Four Peaks. God bless Four Peaks. And god bless America.
