The place was not hard to find at all just follow the smell once on the third floor. The pizza quality was average at best. I would not go back there is average pizza on the strip.
I've been trying to get to this place for a couple of months. It was worth the wait! Kinda pricey but it's hard to find a good slice of pizza some times... $8 a slice of Sicilian and $8 for a 12oz beer on tap... A bit pricey but I'll be back.
It was good.  Pricey but good
I'm a sucker for delicious pizza by the slice! This place is so fun, from discovering it down the unmarked hallway (3rd floor) to the fun decor in the small space. It really captures the pizza by the slice experience of other great cities! The hallway is lined in album covers, many of which are signed. It opens up a little bit into the shop that has counters along the walls and a pin ball machine. . Pizza: they have NY style or Sicilian. I have always gone for classic NY. Pies are out on display and cost around $4-5 per slice. Once you select, they toss it in the oven to heat and crisp it then serve it on lined paper plates. Beer is on tap as well as sodas and water. It's no secret how delicious this pizza is!
We were in town and decided to have a little food adventure to find this place. We were a little disappointed because it wasn't as "hidden" as we thought it would be but that just may be because we hyped it up to ourselves so much. . . As far as the pizza, it was fine. A little too greasy for my taste but the pepperoni was tasty. So was it the best pizza I've ever eaten? Definitely not. Would it be very satisfying at 2am after some drinks? Absolutely.
Wanna know where they got the name Secret Pizza from? It's simple. The pizza is just that, a secret. Nothing more than a whisper lost on the wind.. . A large group of friends and myself rented out a suite upstairs for a bachelor party. We put an order in for 3 pies around 6:00pm, they inform me they should be at my room in 45 minutes. 7:00pm rolls around and I give them a call. They say the pizzas are on their way! 7:30pm comes and no pizza. I call back, they say the pizzas are on their way! 8:00pm comes and no pizza.. . Maybe I should try giving them a call tomorrow or perhaps next week and see if the pies are still on their way.
Best pizza on the strip! The food was spectacular as a warm up to a long night of dancing and drinking. I have recommended it to several friends for their Vegas trips and everyone has said the same. Yumm!
Surprisingly good.  There are no signs so be on the look at if you're at the Cosmo.  I got the pizza with tomatoes and peppers, which I actually liked better than the sausage pizza.  FYI- if you are choosing between Secret Pizza in the Cosmo and Five50 in Aria I would go for Secret Pizza.  Not only is it better, but way cheaper too!
Fun place open Super late or early depending on how u look at it. Good pizza slices couple beers on tap.  . Definitely a place to eat on the strip between midnight and 4am
Delicious Pizza! Having the munchies after a night of clubbing at Marquee or just plain hungry? drop by this little hidden place. Find the doorway and walk through that corridor, you'll see and smell the pizza! . . It isn't too expensive for a slice, $4. Definitely worth getting a pie if you're sharing with a group, its cheaper that way.
SECRETS OUT GUYS!. . This place is seriously a gem. Came here because of Yelp and because of friends who highly recommended this place and I am very glad I did. All I can say for location is to follow the pizza. You will see people coming from the same direction and just head their way and you will reach the magic kingdom! The hallway you walk through is super cool too with records all over the walls and once you get in there are retro arcade games as well! When it was my turn, I wanted to try the white pizza but didn't know if I'd like ricotta cheese so while I was discussing my decision with my cousin, the guy cut me a sliver to try - so nice! I ended up loving that sliver and getting a slice myself while my cousins got the pepperoni and the one with everything.. . Let me tell you, this pizza is not for the health-conscious. It is super super oily and cheesy but hey, what good pizza isn't? The pizza is literally one of the best thin-crust pizzas I've had! It is definitely better  than Lombardi's in NY in my opinion but tied with Artichoke Pizza in NY for my favorite pizza ever. & super affordable!. . Definitely a must-try in my opinion! I tried all 3 and the white pizza was my favorite! DO IT GUYS.
After a night full of drinking and gambling in Sin City, where do you go to get some delicious food after midnight?  SECRET PIZZA.  Located in the Cosmopolitan, finding the little pizza parlor is an adventure in itself.  Secret Pizza is located at the end of the corridor by the pool tables.  There are no signs for the entrance which makes it a bit difficult to find.  I would definitely recommend the white slice, then adding a meat such as pepperoni.  They do offer pies as a whole for sale as well.  One big advice: avoid going to Secret Pizza around 3AM on a Friday or Saturday night.... All the club crawlers from Marquee want pizza too and there will be a long line.
I wasn't impressed.. . During the start of a girls weekend in Vegas, we set our sights on Secret Pizza early on.  Once we "found it" (super easy to find), we walked down the album covered hallway to discover minimal seating and zero ambiance.  The pizza is about as good as an average NY pizzeria (which is to say, it's better than most places =P), so if you're looking for a slice of home, that is what you'll get.  Nothing too special, definitely solid, but this stop was definitely made for post Marquee fuel.  If you want better pizza spot with more ambiance, head over to the Aria and hit up Five50.
This place really is a secret. My friends and I tried looking for it while running into a security guy we asked if he knew where it was and he DIDN'T. He also mentioned we were the second group that asked him that. What the? Don't you work here? . . This "secret pizza" place is located on the THIRD floor of the Cosmo on the east tower. It is toward the end, next to a cafe/bar? I can't remember what it was exactly since I was super excited to see the hallway! Walk down the long hallway with ads/posters on both sides of the wall. It will look like an arcade inside. . . The pizza is really good. Of course not as good as the real NYC pizza but I love how crispy the dough is! The homemade sausage is pretty good as well! Can't complain about the sauce either! :) you should definitely give it a try if you're staying at the Cosmo or nearby!
Secret pizza is the place to go for moderately priced pizza in Vegas. Its kind of hidden (hence the name). It is on the same floor as the pool table at the cosmopolitan. My personal favorite is the white pizza with sausage. Its a thin crust pizza with the perfect cheesy flavor the sausage are legit sausage slices and not the kind from dominos. The normal red pizza is also really good too and typically they have more options for it available. . . It tastes extra good after you're done doing your business at marquee and have those drunchies. But the line is pretty long because everyone from the club goes there after. So if youre not going out at night I would recommend eating before 2:00 am because you will be stuck in a line full of less than sober people. . . The pizza makes it all worth it though.
Third floor in the Cosmo!! When you see the pool table you've made it! The pizza slice is about $4-6 but it's a pretty big portion. They'll heat the slice up for you and boy oh boy is it delicious :) it's thin crust and crispy... None of that soggy stuff :)
Fantastic pizza. Hard to find, but don't hesitate to ask around. Employees at the Cosmopolitan were happy to point us in the right direction. Or look for a stream of giddy people exiting from a random hallway.
Great pizza for when you have those munchies that won't seem to go away when all of the restaurants have closed down past 12 AM. Pick up a slice or an entire box. I got a slice of cheese pizza and it was a generous size. Went back for seconds. I'm sure everything else is as delicious as the cheese pizza is. Definitely go to food when you're drunk and need a quick pick me up or for a snack. Good luck finding it in the hotel. It's hidden away behind a cool alley decorated with records!
Love. Love. Love. Love. . We stop as soon as we're in town. During our stay and then as we leave. It's ridiculously good. Vegas prices of course but worth every penny. Especially the white pie. If you come in from the elevators in the parking garage on the west side I believe it takes you right to it on the third floor. There's a pool table and an art gallery outside of it. Has a clear elevator immediately to the right of the infamous hallway entrance. Must try.
Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and across the escalator through a long hallway you'll find one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. We ordered the white pizza special with pepperoni and some sort of sausage and a mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were delicious! Total came out to $11 for the two pizzas. You can also use your Cosmopolitan Identity Players card to pay for your meal if you have enough points. There isn't really much space to eat inside but you can take your meal outside by the escalator where there is a nice lounge area with plenty of seating. You will find many people devouring their pizzas there! There is also a pool table you can use for free. We will be coming back here again!
Hidden gem of Cosmopolitan - maybe the only thing I really like about that hotel/casino.... . This place hits the spot when you need your pizza fix. Mostly thin crust, but I think they do offer Sicilian style.. . I've tried their pepperoni and cheese - I'm indifferent to either one. The pizza that gives this four stars is the White pizza (Ricotta, mozzarella, and herbs). This is probably the only one that will keep me coming back. . . It's wonderfully greasy, chewy texture of melted cheese, and the salty, garlicky goodness makes the pizza addicting.. . NOTE: It can get packed...be prepared to stand in line for a while if you hit a busy period.
This psuedo-hidden pizza joint is just one of the many reasons to LOVE The Cosmopolitan. Secret Pizza serves legit New York-style pies of all varieties, and their hours are every bit as legit as their pizza (open 'til 5am). It's the perfect compliment to a long night out - you'll impress the your friends with your secret-hidden-spot knowledge, and soak up the Vegas booze while you're at it!. . The beer selection could be a bit better, with only two varieties on draft (Bud Light and Blue Moon when I was there), but that's being picky, isn't it?. . Not much more I can say that hasn't already been said, except: GO HERE!  :)
Ahh Secret Pizza, how I adore my alcohol induced memories of you.... . At $5.50 for a decent at best, cheese pizza slice and 50 cents extra per additional topping, my cheap self would not purchase this if it were located anywhere else. But alas it's Vegas and when you're craving pizza at 3 in the morning you kind of just dgaf. That being said I come here over and over again. 4 STARS!!
Great hidden joint! First time to Vegas (and the states) from Australia so the only thing we wanted was a nice big, traditional slice of pizza that we always see in the movies. The pizza was great! $5 a slice so it was more pricey than other pizza shops we had been too, save some money and buy it by the pie not a slice. Perfect for when you haven't slept for 36hrs and need sustenance fast. You'll find it on the top floor of the Cosmo, down an alley of old vinyl records, no signage around, and it doesn't need it. Every second person can point you in the direction.
It's almost like geocaching in the Cosmo to find this place. Really good pizza and very friendly staff. Cool decor, too. Would definitely eat here again.
Been here couple times since my parents always stay at the Cosmo hotel! Good decent place for a quick bite. There is only a couple seating in there. It is located on the 2nd floor in a little hallway with a bunch of records on the wall. Very easy to miss!!!! I've had the pepperoni and the white pizza! Both are ok , kind of oily .
Directions from other yelpers were spot on.  We had no problem finding it.  . . We lucked out with our timing because we were the only ones without pizza when we walked in.  Straight to the register and we went simple... 2 pepperoni slices and side of the house made pickled peppers (a must if they have it).  It was delicious and I would definitely go back.  If you appreciate pizza and the simplicity, it was spot on.  I wish I had more room to try other slices but I had been on a food fest since arriving.  . . Also, it's worth it to come here just to check out the hotel.  Gorgeous!  Felt like I was in some NYC boutique hotel.  Of course the gambling area is like any other.  But the lobby and hallways and shops... it's worth it to come see a beautiful hotel.
I am amazed I found this place upon leaving Marquee one night last summer after a heavy night of partying. . . I've made several trips to Vegas since then and always make it a point to drop by for a slice and cup of PBR. . . Crusty crust and tasty toppings. Simple slice of tasty za. . One of the amazing spots inside the Cosmopolitan.
The pizza was ok. The hallway looked like my old bathroom in Brooklyn with all the album covers... Swoon. . . Taking off two points for having a wall sized photo mural of Soho NYCs venerable and legit Lombardis on Spring street and then the pizza literally tastes nothing like that brick oven wonderland. But one point back on for the fairly babely tattooed dudes running the spot. What can I say I'm a sucker for skater boys. Blame Avril Levigne?
The best pizza west of Mississippi. Love the crust and fresh toppings. Sauce is perfect. Love NewYork,Chicago and Rome for pizza but this is as good. Always willing to walk here no matter where I stay in Vegas.
Honestly not very impressed. I had the slice with meatball which the meatball was good, but the pizza itself is clearly made hours before hand and just sits cold, which reflects in the stale texture and bland taste. It was a big let down from all the inflated hype from reviews I saw on here. However if you're drunk this place is perfect to sop up some alcohol.
Secret Pizza is secret.  Tucked in a corner they have some great pizza to sling out of their little corner store.  Line was out the door but worth the wait.
Far from being a secret as far as a pizza joint. One of hosts walking around even told me it's easy to find, it's right around the corner when I asked for some direction. And when I got there, the line was as long as a concession stand at a Lakers game during halftime! Guess the whole building knew about this secret joint! The pizza was decent... I've had better. Main reason two stars fall is because I woke up the next morning with more gas than a Chevron station!
This Hidden Pizza joint is inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it's definitely hidden  I found out about it from a friend who visited a month prior and it was mentioned when we checked in.  It's near many of the other restaurant but there's NO signage ANYWHERE for this place.  Hence  the secret I guess.  . . We went to check it out when we first arrived to possibly get a quick lunch but it doesn't have places to sit and eat so we decided to try it later.  Bad move! . . While there during the day, there was  no line, but things changed at 3 in the morning.  There was a serious line.  But what are you to do when it's the only place open and you need some grease? . Line moved fairly quickly and we got the slices we were eyeing earlier.  We tried the white pizza and pepperoni with peppers.  . Pizza was bomb!  Loved that it's all thin crust.  Had some good flavors going on.  The white pizza with ricotta/garlic was my favorite!   . Highly recommend if you're in the area.
Tried this place lasttime I stayed at the Cosmo. Was referred to by one of the security working MARQUEE. I love how it is located down a long unmarked hallway, making it feel that much more "secret". It's very New York looking, with a simple no frills menu on the wall. NO RANCH in huge capital letters made me giggle. I love the contrast of this pizza joint placed inside of an uber stylish modern sleek hotel. This place has become a staple when visiting Vegas now. Easily some of the best pizza I've ever had.
Secret pizza. A secret no more?  The guy said the Food Network had just left shooting a segment the day we got there. I'm pretty sure in the near future, this amazing little place will be a packed house 24/7. . . Secret pizza located in the Cosmopolitan hotel in vegas is truly one of those awesome places you wish existed everywhere else in the world. Simple and good food, quick, friendly service, and open from 10am - 5am (for those midnight pizza cravings!). The pizzas are hot and cheesy and crispy! Pretty much exactly how I like them. . . Prices are reasonable, about $5 or so a slice. You walk up and see what they have to offer, choose your slices, and they pop it in the oven to heat it and crisp it up for you. The meatball ricotta pizza they had was ridiculously yummy - dollops of ricotta mixture, yummy meatball. Mmm. It's a thin NY style pizza I'd say, but they sometimes also have these fluffy deep dish offerings that pretty much taste like huge crispy cheesy garlic breads. Very yummy! . . They also make a pretty mean cannoli and the guys there are super welcoming and friendly. Ooh, and free filtered water!! Gotta love that. Love it here! It's a must eat in vegas for sure :)
Ok.. the pizza here is good... but I don't understand the hype! My friends always want Secret Pizza whenever we go to Vegas.. but WHY... . . To me.. Secret Pizza is just pizza... nothing special.. but if I had to recommend something, the white pizza is the best out of all the other ones I've tried here. . . Conveniently located in Cosmo for those of you who like Marquee Day/Night club.. I guess it's something you should at least try once. But don't have too high expectations!
Pizza tasted ok, was pretty greasy despite me taking off excessive oil with a napkin, got the white pizza. 10 min later had to run to bathroom!! Actually in 3. Haven't eaten anything for 6 hrs before then. You may get sick, proceed with caution
Great spot esp if you need a quick snack post drinking and gambling. A little pricey but it's the strip!
