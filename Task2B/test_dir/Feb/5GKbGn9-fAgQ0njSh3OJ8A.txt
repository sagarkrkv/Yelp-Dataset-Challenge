I'd give Lavo 3.5 stars, big serving sizes (each plate our group ordered could easily be shared) food wasn't bad, wasn't the best tasting pasta I've ever had but I guess when in Vegas you pay Vegas prices!
Went here on a Saturday night for dinner before a night out in Vegas. To be honest the setting is great - nice lofty, extravagant restaurant feel you want when you're in Vegas but the food was just a bit 'meh' and the worst thing was the air-conditioning. We had to ask to be moved to a more central table just to get body heat off the rest of the diners and we saw other tables do the same or put their jackets back on. . . We were a group of 4 and share 2 pizzas and 2 salads - which were all just ok. The pizza's were fairly dry as they only seemed to use chopped tomatoes as a sauce base rather than any passata and the salads were measly for around $18-19 a pop!. . It was Ok but I wouldn't rush back.
Nice restaurant/club/lounge. Italian food is good, but not great. Noisy atmosphere. DJ plays in the restaurant while you eat. Hard to have dinner conversation. . My biggest problem with Lavo was the service, from start to finish. Checked in for my 830 reservation & was told they were "running a little behind". Fine. 45 minutes later we finally got seated. No apology. No "let me buy you a drink while you wait". No manager checking on us or offering anything for the inconvenience. . Tables are, of course, on top of each other. Waiters do a good job, but are over loaded. They are running constantly. Do not look for too much attention..  . Lastly, we had a "mystery charge" on our bill, which I assume most people pay unnecessarily if they don't read the check. I understand mistakes happen & I wouldn't mention this as a negative except that I noticed the same waiter had the same "mistake" with the couple two tables away from us immediately before we paid our bill. I guess we weren't ordering enough to run up the bill so they did it for us. Of course, no apology was forthcoming from, the manager upon his correction of this error either. . With all of the restaurant choices in Vegas (or just at The Venetian for that matter) I am surprised this place is surviving. . I'll never go back.
This is NOT a review on the nightclub portion.. We went to dinner here this weekend and fell in love! Their staff is so accommodating to gluten allergies and very knowledgeable about their menu and wine list. The service was spot on! The food was out of this world.
From the bread all the way to the desert, everything was so  delicious. The meatballs is to die for. The beat salad perfect. Love love the food! Def recommending this place to everyone!
Awesome club, great DJ's and cool drinks!
Homophobic and sexist. Don't come here. You will be treated as a minority and second class citizen if you are gay.
