Love Tao. It took a bit for me to actually like it because the first time I went, my phone got stolen. However, my promoter is the absolute best and gets my group in without problems and free drinks for all my gals. I've literally brought a group of 80+ and got everyone in perfectly fine. My friend sometimes DJ's here too so it's very fun to come out and support. I come here quite often, it never lets me down (other than my first time). I love that there are two different spaces for different types of music. They have a lot of  celebs here and the venue is big, but small enough for you to check out the celebs.
I was here on a Thursday night with a bunch of my cousins and we had a blast! We got in for free through this promoter my cousin knew so we just had to check in and they let us right on through. .  The atmosphere was pretty awesome, when you walk in there are baths filled with rose petals and glass cages with hot women posing. Once you get into the club it is pretty crowded,so definitely not for people who don't want to be touched, but that wasn't a huge problem for us. .  There was a good guy:girl ratio so plenty of people to mingle with. **A note for the ladies, you shouldn't have to bring much cash here, there are tons of guys offering to buy. Vegas baby! . . Overall I would definitely come here again the next time I am in Vegas, lots of fun for girls looking to have a good time. Service was so-so, but considering the crowd it was acceptable. Drinks were a little watered down at the bar so I would recommend bottle service which was excellent.
More like 2 and a half stars but I rounded up.  I've only been here once but in my opinion, one time is enough.  So if you don't want to take my opinion then stop reading.  . . Tao is located inside the Venetian which is a gorgeous hotel.  I stayed at the Palazzo once, which is adjacent to the Venetian and absolutely loved it.  Tao does not live up to the Venetian name.  It is pretty, don't get me wrong, lots of things to look at and a nice cool smoking balcony area, for those of you that smoke.  I don't, by the way.  You enter in through the restaurant then go up the stairs to the club itself, so it is somewhat awkward because you see patrons trying to enjoy their dinner while hordes of girls and guys are walking in ready to party.  . . Tao is small, so therefore it gets insanely crowded.  If you do not have bottle service you are stuck in the crowd, and trust me it gets very packed, to the point where it is hard to move.  If you have bottle service, you are a lot more comfortable but here comes the question, if bottle service is worth it?  There's an upstairs portion with tables that only people with table service are allowed to go up to.  It is considerably less crowded than the dance floor.. . The good things about Tao is that there's open bar for ladies before a certain time and that's why I rounded up my stars. . . Side story: I got accused by the bartender, who was a girl, of passing on drinks to other people, because I wanted to get another drink after she made me one like 5 minutes or so beforehand.  I finished the drink so fast because it was pretty much juice with a splash of liquor but whatever, it was free so I'm venting, not complaining.. . The off thing about Tao is their upstairs bathroom.  Whoever designed them really had no clue about drunk people.  So it's a clear glass door that gets frosted when you lock it.  So clearly if you're drunk you might forget to lock the door, which is what happened to a friend of mine.  Luckily we saw that she didn't lock it and stood in front of the door hiding her.  No free shows tonight!
Tao was a great way to end our Vegas trip!! Great music strong drinks and good vibes! When we were getting ready to leave the door guy gave all of my friends complimentary very cute comfy flip flops so we didn't have to walk back to our hotel in heels! It was an awesome experience I would definitely go again!
Went here on a Friday night with my two guy buddies. We got a table and bottle service, bottles started at 450 and go all the way up. We ordered a bottle of stoli and some chasers, the staff was excellent and very accommodating to us. The club got packed and I was very very happy that we had a table. Towards the end of the night we had our table upgraded to directly next to the DJ booth which was awesome for sure.The dance floor is prettysmall for Vegas standards so be aware of that. On a cool note there is a balcony with some nice views of the strip. There was a good male to female ratio in the club. Overall a great club experience I would do it again and recommend getting a table and arriving early.
This is one of my friends and my fav nightclubs in Vegas. Although it is quite small, especially the dance floor, we found the people there generally pretty nice. We really liked one of the promotors there and he was very friendly and helped us get seated and make us drinks and stuff. He's been working there for a while and we met him last time when we were in Vegas as well.. . We also liked that they have an open bar from 1030-1115 I think. It's always good to have free drinks. Right? The decorations inside was also pretty interesting. Very Asian. They also have some exhibition ares where sexy ladies lay in the bathtubs filled with rose petals and some other models in a glass room displaying and stuff. They also got some pretty friendly and nice dancers on the stage. Music usually is house music, not weird or anything. Very enjoyable experiences in the past four times I was there.
