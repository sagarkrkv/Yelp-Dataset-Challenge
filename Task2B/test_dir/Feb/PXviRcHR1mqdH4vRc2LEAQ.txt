i love that it is open till 2.00 am and the burgers here the best in town
Forget the tourist food on the strip.  You will not be disappointed with Bachi. . . 5 stars from the Foodsnob is very rare as everything has to be perfect from concept,  cleanliness, service and of course the food. . . Went with large enough party and got to sample a few different signature burgers - all were amazing.  Order the truffle Parmesan fries and a beer. Simply heaven.
Another good burger in vegas!  If you haven't been to Bachi burger, I strongly suggest it.  The Kobe burger is my recommendation.  It's juicy and tastes amazing!   The burger was cooked perfectly.  I also suggest the black and white milkshake.  Service was great, the only problem is the wait.  This is very popular right now, so expect a 20-30 minute wait.
This is "Our Place" for casual dining. It's usually always packed 'cause its THAT GOOD, even on a Tuesday night. Everything about it is awesome; food, service and cleanliness.
Beware of the service here on weekends. Yes, you drove your asses all the way over here and now there's a 45-75 min wait. But you know what? The food is amazing and they know it. And they will use that to their advantage.. . The hostess really knows how to make your experience a shitty one. No smiles, very stern voice, and absolutely no common sense. We had to wait next to an empty table for 4 for about 30 min while she was "building a table" for a bigger party. There was no, "Sorry for the wait" or "Thanks for your patience". But once you get past her incompetence, it's smooth sailing from there.. . Food is great, you MUST order the oxtail chili fries. That is the only reason I will put up with the crappy hostess. I've tried most of the burgers and they have all been mouth watering. The best part is that each burger will come with their own little surprise that will have you asking, "Excuse me, what is this, and what is it for?" You'll understand when you see it.
Bachi never ceases to provide some of the best fusion burgers I've ever had. I just ordered the oxtail fries which are always good and the Alaskan cod fish burger. The cod was moist and not dry, if u like cod like I do. Give this burger a try, especially with lent approaching. . If you are an American burger fan this might not be your place. If u have an ounce of foodie adventurer in you. You should love this place. Bring friends an excellent place to hang.
After my friend had been super excited and raving about this place, I was disappointed that it's really not that great for vegetarians or vegans. The burger I got just didn't have a tasty flavor. Just kind of sour and sickly sweet. I actually got sick of eating it and stopped..which HARDLY EVER happens to me.
Meh..burgers around 15 bucks... Had the Ronin..hubby had Spicy Miso..they were good but maybe not as good as the yelp reviews made us anticipate.  Truffle fries were average. The kid got grilled cheese that looked good.  Rogue Hazelnut Ale was really good however. Not sure if I'd give this place another chance. ..there are just too many other choices nearby and they didnt dazzle us for the 80 dollard we spent
Fabulous ! Loved the 2 burgers we ordered and split. Kimchi and the Kiki burgers were what we ordered along with garlic fries which also came seasoned with ginger and jalapenos. Cooked medium rare as we ordered, great flavor on a perfect bun. Service was also casual but attentive. A must stop when we are back in town again.
we were not impressed. Average wait time. Average tasting food. We should have stayed closer to the strip.
Amazing food! I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Truffle and Sweet Potato Fries. So delicious! Love it :)
Just walked in, 40 minute wait. Not bad for a Saturday night. Waited about 25 minutes & 2 parties who walked in after me got seated. Went to host to see how many parties before me...my name was crossed off. No biggy, I'm with a large party, didn't make a big stink but just let them know that I've been waiting here & they never called my name. Host apologized & said it'll be no more than 10 minutes. Manager got us seated in 10 minutes & brought us an oxtail chili fries on the house. He put the fire out quick.. Our server, jordan, was awesome. Had recommendations for us & attentive. I ordered the miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger..delicious! Loved the egg, bacon, & onion rings in it. Just the right amount of everything in every bite. I ordered the pork belly steamed buns for the kids & my daughter loved it. We also had dessert...chocolate peanut butter souffle w/wild berry compote. It was ok, I was expecting more peanut butter flavor but it was made beautifully. . Check comes & they told us they took off all the gratuity for large parties. Great food and they handled everything quickly. This is how a restaurant should run. Great job, will be back when we're back in town. . . Thank you bachi burger!
My husband and I chose this location due to Yelp reviews and it was so worth it.  We were on our way out of town and starving so got there right when they opened. The music is loud and thumping but you forget that the minute your food comes. I had the Miyagi-San and my husband had the Ronin. We thought we'd each have half of each burger but that didn't happen.  After the first bite you have to sit back and breathe, they are so good!  WOWOWOWOW!  Fabulously tender and so many wonderful flavors. We will go there every time we are in Vegas.
When will this establishment open in sawtelle ("Los Angeles")? I can't wait till I taste that oxtail chilli cheese fries in my mouth again... . . I got the the spicy miso burger... It wasn't spicy... Kind of sad I wanted some kick! However, it wasn't the best burger I had it was ok.. I don't know you must really have to wow me on the burgers for me to love it! I think it's just it's burger or it's just burger lol.... . My mom got the bahn mi burger I thought it was better than mine just because I think it had more flavor and more crunch. . My dad got kiki's burger ... My first choice since I love mushrooms so much tho he was mean to not share booo so can't tell you what that tastes like.... . Since the oxtail chilli cheese fries came as an appetizer I wanted to try the parmesian fries... You know bad mistake!?! I think I was too full too like this plus it felt like poutine instead of parmesian fries! Like I thought it was just going to be fries with parmesian and truffle oil but I didn't think they'd put gravy on it! . . But seriously, when are you coming to LA?
Finally got a chance to try this place out this visit.  I'm bringing the wifey back next time!. . Ordered: . . Ox-tail chili fries - Wow i love chili fries and this is just like adding heaven to an already great side!  Must have if you like things that are fatty!. Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Very refreshing and nice starter.. Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu - I'm done searching for the ideal burger as it has now arrived.  It's fancy, it's big, it's rich but the way each flavor is introduced bite after bite, chew after chew it's texturally perfect and juicy is an understatement.  . . Some go to mecca, i'm coming here for my spiritual fix.
We take ALL of our visitors from out-of-state here, no question. And every single person has liked it. This location updated their room to have a bar, too and are open into the late hours, if that's what you want. We've never been here so late before due to our toddler. Doesn't matter, though, we still LOVE it. Be warned. Lunchtime can have a long wait. . Their  fries are great, but it's their burgers we crave. Kiki's is my husband's go-to order. Mine is the Banh Mi Burger (Vietnamese flair). There's also a Korean type, a Ronin, with a fried egg, Taro bun burger, and a heck of a lot more. You can design your own, too, if you prefer. They've added new appetizers and foreign beers, too. Go check it out!
Came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. The oxtail cheese fries were crazy and delicious and the burgers (Miyagi and a custom) were killer. The craft beer list was very strong and the staff was knowledgeable.
Amazing burgers. I got the Miyagi burger and the bachi fish. Come here to get food! I definitely recommend! Will definitely come again.
Nice restaurant and vibe. Had better burger with fried egg else where.
I've been here before and had the Shogun burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. I Remember both being so incredibly AWESOME I had to come back, so we did.. My wife and myself weren't all that terribly hungry, but it was kind of a "to do" list on the way back from Vegas.. . We walk in at about 10pm on a Thursday night. It's slow and there's a lot of staff on hand. We get seated by a guy who seems entirely indifferent about his job and just life in general. You may be wondering how I know this about a simple . host /  hostess???? Because he was our waiter also. There were TOO many people working and only two other tables seated to get bad service. Not that bad service is ever excusable, but there are times when you understand to some degree. . . Like I said, we weren't that hungry so we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and a side salad; which sounded decent in the description. Micro greens, some kind of walnuts, avocado, and an orange vinaigrette. . . The fries come out first and the first thing I notice was the fries to chili ratio. Way off. Too much fries and not enough chili. Not a big deal cause there's no way we're finishing them. We start to dig in and holy crap is there a TON of salt on there. Enough salt to start my own mine if i was feeling  entrepreneur-ish. We didn't complain because fries don't save well and we were already full.. . The house salad then comes out. Being a MAN, I feel a certain sense of obligation to conquer this small salad, even though i already feel like a glutton (first world problems, I know). So I take a bite.....  GOD DAMN!!!! Did a salt grenade go off in the back or something? Not only were the fries too salty, but the salad? Maybe someone in the back just discovered how great salt can be and was of the mindset "more is obviously better"? Enough about salt. The orange  vinaigrette was good. The avocado was pretty much non existent (two small chunks), but the walnuts were delicious.. . Maybe my memory deceives me, but i could have sworn I LOVED this place when I came about a year ago. Bachi has a unique twist on the whole burger thing, but that twist isn't good enough to keep me coming back
Definitely had high expectations for this place ever since I saw it featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but the food was just alright. Probably because i ordered the wrong thing.  . . Came on a Saturday at 12:30pm... just managed to miss the lines.  We sat at the bar.  . I got the MIYAGI SAN burger.  It has fried onion straws, fried egg, bacon and beef patty.  No greens.  Would definitely have liked some sort of green or something lighter to balance out the other heavy flavors. The first few bites were quite good, then it just got too heavy for me.. . Boyfriend got the Korean BBQ burger; that one was much better!  I loved the gochu jang aioli! Great flavor balance.. . We also ordered the kurobata sausage appetizer... it was good, but it's like Asian lil smokies. Nothing too special.. . The donut holes dessert were hard as a rock and not worth getting at all.. . All of the above plus 2 drinks = $60 lunch (post-tip). I am very curious about the banh mi burger and i would go back just to try that one.
I wanted to like Bachi Burger. I've been here a few times, hoping that the visit before was just a fluke, but nope, Bachi is not for me. The service is fine, the waiters attentive, and I really enjoyed the fries, but there was just something off to me about the flavor of the burgers. Maybe it's just me because the people I go with enjoy the burgers, but it is what it is.. . The latest visit was with a friend of mine from out of town and I wanted to take him to a burger joint off the Strip. We ordered edamame as our appetizer and truffle parmesan fries. I ordered a Kiki's Burger (angus beef, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli) and while I finished the burger, I tried really hard to not show on my face that I thought it tasted off. My friend enjoyed his burger just fine which makes me happy, but I did not enjoy mine. I had hoped it would because I love mushrooms! Everything about the burger on paper sounds great. It's just something about the sauce or something that makes me not want to order it again.
The in-laws are in town and they wanted to give this place a try because they had seen it on TV. We also brought a bottle of wine along (heads up, corkage is $20) to celebrate their arrival.. . We ordered the steamed pork buns, sweet potato fries, a ronin burger, and two miyagi burgers; one with mayonnaise and one without (for me).. . The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked; not too crispy, oily, or floppy like most places make them.  The pork buns were also really delicious, but the buns weird me out (sorry).  My burger was literally the bomb dot com.  The fried egg was perfectly cooked (not too runny but still yolky), the burger was juicy and tender, and the bacon... Mmmmm!  I didn't like how uncooked the fried onion rings seemed to be, but I'm not an onion person. I took a few bites with them on and eventually gave them to dad.  The burger was really messy, but I don't care.. . *Note: I dislike burgers and typically stay away from places like this and I can't wait to go back!
I bought the Miyagi burger and it was the best burger I've ever had!
WOW!  This was our first stop as soon as we arrived in Vegas.  I'm a big Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives fan.  I saw this place featured on one of the episodes. The service and food was amazing.  The manager actually chatted with us several times from behind the bar.  He gave us a couple of good recommendations on the beers they sold. Our server also provided great recommendations.  Great vibe. We ordered the spicy miso burger, the banh mi burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. OMG!  All were so tasty!    Highly recommend all of these items.  It was go good that we stopped by for another meal before heading back to Southern Cali.
Okay,  I am moving this from three to five star status. The main reason is that besides all my details in the first review, note:. . Of all he twenty dollar burger joints this one is the best, most creative and flavorful. . . I think the service, menu and quality is top notch and compared to my 2011 review this  place in 2013 and 2014 is fantastic. . . Come here and try this place out. You will be very happy.
THE SHOGUN BURGER.. . THE. BEST. BURGER. I'VE. EVER. HAD. . You absolutely have to order this burger if you come here!!!! Yes, it's pricey, but it was definitely worth the $26 I spent on it! I almost didn't order it because of the price, but my boyfriend really wanted it so we ordered it! I'm not usually a fan of fancy burgers.... I;m usually satisfied with In N' Out. But this burger changed my life! And now I know... If I didn't order that burger... I would've been missing out on THE BEST BURGER ever made in the history or burgers!. . The Shogun Burger:. Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and a Yamamomo Peach Palette Cleanser . . The other food I ordered at Bachi Burger was also excellent! I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns and the Ox Tail Fries. Both were absolutely delicious.
Okay. I was updating this review and gave it a five star. I do have to adjust them to a four star however. . . The food and creativity is exceptional. The service is generally great. Today we were there for my wife's birthday and it took over one hour for our burgers. Others were served before us as well and they arrived after us. Three times we were told the food was going to be out in two minutes even though we never asked nor complained. The third two minute statement we timed it for fun and it was 22 minutes before hey came back to tell us our food would be cooked next. . . I advised the managers that on the forth time and after almost 1.5  hours  that this was disappointing as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. They did say ' for what it is worth, Happy Birthday'. I think they were genuine. . . Food came out past the 1.5 hour mark and my wife's burger was medium rare instead of well done and they heated it up instead of a new one due to time. By then, my wife was not happy, the burger fell apart and was not tasty. She ate a bite and took the kids and left. I waited for the check. The team at Bachi was nice to not charge for her messes up burger. . . Unfortunately when they are too busy or when they make errors they do not know how to properly take ownership and control the situation. It got worse and worse and spoiled a celebration.  . . So this is still a great place with quality staff and food. They just need to get to a first class five star bydealing with adversity instead positively rather than matter of fact like. . . They did nothing really wrong. Just when it got bad, they were ill equipped to shine. . . 4 star but 5 star food.
Damn, what? This place shot up the list of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.. . I'll start with the burgers. First of all, there wasn't one burger OR sandwich I did not want to try. Everything sounded absolutely delicious. I wish I had a slider of each them. I ended up getting the kiki's burger and it was just what I expected. All the ingredients (garlic chili aioli, gruyere, all the Asian mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, caramelized bacon) came together really well on top of the angus beef patty. Although I gravitate to simpler burgers (i.e. Father's Office Burger in LA), this burger was just a burst of flavor. It was inventive and delicious.. . Now for my favorite part of the meal: the oxtail chili cheese fries. After my first bite, I seriously exclaimed: HOLY CRAP WHAT IS THIS. It was insanely delicious to me. The fries were incredibly crispy, and the oxtail with the chili was just superb. Topped with cheese and a fried egg, damn. It just doesn't get better than this. I would never think to put oxtail on chili cheese fries, but props to the people who figured this out.. . Every time I come to Vegas, this is where I'm going to want to eat.
So we arrived to vegas a bit late and craved burgers. I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!. . I'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny. . . Truffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at all. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.. . Shogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imo. . Kiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burger. . Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!. . Spicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.. . The patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better. I wouldn't mind coming back though next time I'm in vegas and craving asian fusion burgers
Best burgers in the world!!! The service was fantastic. I love how the servers work as a team!! No lazy fools like other work places!! I love it! Their oxtail chili cheese fries were AMAZING!!!!! So delicious (I wish they'd put more oxtail) nonetheless, they were on point! The buns are sweet and savory! Meat is tender and juicy! And the sauce is to die for! Kiki and ronin burgers are awesome! Bachi burger is amazing most def recommend. It hits the spot!!!
Best burger ever! Homemade bun so soft and somewhat like Hawaiian bread. Truffle fries are amazing!
Got off our plane, got the rental car, and we were STARVING. My hubby and son just wanted "a good burger". Yelp led us here, and we are so thankful. There was a 15 minute wait because the place is quite small, but it was worth the wait. Burgers were very big and delicious! Cooked exactly as ordered. My "no meat" burger was an odd sounding combo of flavors- barley, tofu, eggplant, walnuts, etc, but it was the best vegetarian burger I've ever had. Onion rings were great but salty. Fries were decent. Our only negative was the overly loud club music they were playing at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. My son has been asking to return all week, and he might get his wish!
LOVE Bachi Burger!  Best burgers we have had.  The Mr. Ho's on the taro bun is simply amazing.  The Black & Blue is another favorite of ours.  All of the fries are wonderful, but the sweet potato fries are my favorite.  IF you have room for dessert after the main course, try the Portuguese donuts.  You won't be disappointed.
Very Good Burger  Would hit this up again when in Vegas
I wanted to like this place,  I really did, ive seen lots of reviews so I came and was excited to try. Im a big fan of burgers but this place disappointed me in every aspect. . . We order three burgers so we could try, the pork belly bun, and the fries with gravy I forget its  name. We tried three different burgers all medium rare and they all came well. It was a total disappointment, I would have asked to have for it to me remade if the waiter did not look so pre occupied (ill get more to that later). I forget the names now but all the burger were dry dry dry and some of the flavors we surprising not in a good way. I love pork belly buns but these buns were sub par. The flavors didnt stand out anf not memorable at all.. . Now let me get to the service. . . They seated us really quickly which was great since they had only six tables occupied, one large table which was already eating when we were sat. It took them a while to take our order, get our drinks.  When the food came, the waiter disappeared, from our table I mean. The food came and it looked epic which made the disapoointment greater. I had to ask him for ketchup and share plates.  But then he left for awhile and I wanted to ask for utensil but he didnt come back until we were ready to leave. I didnt understand why the service was so poor when they looked like they had more than ample staff walking around, just not near our table. They didnt refill our waters and while we were eating, some lady in the kitchen was yelling or talking quite loud. Really unprofessional.  . . Will not be back
Y U M M Y!!!! Their burgers are juicy, succulent, and absolutely original!! We started off with:. . Oxtail fries: This is more like chili fries with oxtail bits in it...to be honest I wasn't a huge fan. Plain unseasoned fries with chili and dry bits of meat...ehhhhh it's okay. I would rather go for regular fries next time.. . Sweet potato fries (garlic truffle): I've never tried garlic truffle SWEET potato fries before...so it was interesting. I think I prefer the garlic truffle on normal fries, but it was a good experience. Regardless, the fries were cooked well and overall well received.. . I can't really go over all the burgers, but everyone loved their burger and I could see messy juices running down chins and onto tables...banh mi burger and Mr. Ho are some MUST TRYs. If you have a smaller appetite, then go for the steamed buns. There are 3 dinky little buns that still taste great, but like I said...just smaller portion (definitely not for Hungry Hippo Me, but to each their own). . . I can't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip and try more of their delicious burgers! DEFINITELY a must have!
Whenever you need me. Whenever want me,. You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly. Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me at...BACHI BURGER! - Wiz Khalifa (roll up). . After all these years, I finally made my way to the infamous Bachi Burger. The wait is kinda long as there aren't that many tables inside but since the weather was nice, it wasn't a problem. I'm not sure how I would feel about the wait if I was hungover and standing outside in the summer vegas heat though lol. . Since I had peking duck buns at the Wynn buffet the night before, we opted for the pork belly buns instead and they were delicious. The oxtail fries were quite good, not standout-ish but a nice change of pace as far as fries are concerned. The Miyagi wagyu burger was tasty, and maybe a little messy but the strong flavors were there. The egg was nice but I prefer smaller pieces of bacon. I definitely recommend sharing a burger though with someone (especially if you're planning to order other things) because the fries are a huge portion and the burger is also big enough to be shared. . . Definitely worth taking friends that have never been before.
Get your sweatpants on and your oversized pajama shirt ready for this feast because you'll be needing the extra room to fit this baby--burger baby specifically into your belly.. . The food is absolutely delicious and heavy. We started out with ox tail french fries and pork belly steamed buns. The ox tail portion resembled more like sauce filled with shreds of ox meat blended in there to give it the goopy texture. I've never had ox tail like this and I'd highly recommend this item if this was the only time you could go here. . . I ordered the Kiki burger and despite not being hungry, finished the entire patty and the contents inside. The buns were only for my visual pleasure. The patty was a heavy Angus beef  with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. And when I say, heavy, you can feel the weight drop on your hand.. . On the scale of gourmet burgers, it ranks very high. For its price, you get the comparable weight of two Big Macs. I may not appreciate that as much, but boy, was it delicious.
If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!. . Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.. . Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.. . Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste. Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just theright amount of heat. This was my favorite!. Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try. . So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!  . . So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas.
I'm sitting here currently having flashback/ withdrawals from that trippy acid burger! Wtf... I came out of review retirement just to praise this place of holy cow happiness. If they build one of these bad boys in L.A watch out Umami, F.O, or insert your  favorite burger joint here_________! The Shogun is Shonuff the baddest cow around and you should definitely  kiss it's Converse... Leeeeeeerooooy!
My friends have been hyping this place up for such a long time. I'm glad I finally got to try it. We came up to Vegas on a Saturday around 1PM. We had a large group of 9 and waited quite some time, at least they were nice about it. It's located off the strip on the South end in a shopping plaza.. . Our server was really nice and helpful, he knew we were hungry so we jumped right into ordering.. . Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - Delicious, probably my fav. Kiki's Burger - the mushrooms seems a bit misplaced, wish they weren't so soggy, but everything else was super juicy. Oxtail fries with fried egg - MUST GET THIS TO SHARE, so bomb, it's like canto restaurant indo fried rice but on fries instead.. . All in all, is this the best burger place in Vegas? Probably not. Is this the best bang for the buck burger? Hell yes. These burgers are roughly $11 and they are delicious for the price you're paying compared to other burger spots on the strip.
To ALL burger buffs, meat hounds, Asian flavor fanatics, diner devotees and to just-plain ol' hungry human beings:. . I dedicate this experience to you all!. . It all started one cold Saturday evening in February 2014 when the bf and I decided to pop our Bachi Burger cherry. Wait time: 25-30 minutes. Though medium-to-large groups lingered in and around the restaurant, these groups were diminishing at a pretty impressive pace. Names were being called from left to right. It didn't take long until the hostess finally said what I've been yearning to hear for the past half hour..."Rachel.". . Once seated, the menus eagerly flipped open and the bf and I were enticed to such great heights. The selection of starters and burgers were bountiful but after careful consideration the lucky winners went as followed:. . Ox-tail chili cheese fries:. This appetizer should be a REQUIREMENT when dining here. A large, hot plate stacked with crispy thin fries immersed in generous amounts of salty and savory chili, shredded ox-tail AND crowned with a perfectly fried egg--tell me what's not to like? This portion is perfect for 2 adults with a tenacious appetite.. . Kiki burger (my choice):. I knew this burger was calling to me when I first read caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade. The words 'caramelized' and 'sweet' being the major deal breakers. Unfortunately, that's where the courtship between Kiki and I comes to an end. Though the meat patty excelled in juiciness and the bacon maintained its candied glaze, it fell short elsewhere. I was underwhelmed by the not-so-sweet-non-existent-taste-of-onion marmalade and the slight bitterness of the greens. But it wasn't a total fail for my appetite. Like a short-lived romance with an ex--we shared some good moments and also some bad--but in the end, I never really saw any great potential. Kiki just wasn't meant for me.. . Ronin burger (the bf's choice):. Any burger with a fried egg is pretty much en route to the bf's belly. There's no way he's going to let it slip on by. The only problem with this burger was that it was HIS and not mine. We cut both our burgers in half and traded so we could sample each others but deep-down inside as soon as I sunk my teeth into this burger I was hooked. Ronin grabbed a hold of my taste buds and never wanted to let go. It was love at first bite. So many wonderful things were happening in my mouth that made it nearly impossible to ingest. An orchestra of flavors and textures that was beautifully executing a rhapsody. I wanted to salvage the juiciness of the meat, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the tang and crunch of the coleslaw and even the saltiness of the fried egg. Bravo Ronin. Bravo!. . If my experience doesn't make you want to feed the beast then you're completely and utterly missing out. Bachi Burger is a MUST try when in Vegas. Their Asian-fusion/Asian-inspired take on the classical American burger is pure genius.. . Don't believe me? Then just listen to what your inner soul is saying because I'm pretty sure it sounds something like this.... . GO. TO. BACHI BURGER.. . NOW!
Today I am giving 5 stars. Why, you are asking... . Today was the 5th time within the last six months that I ate there, and it is consistently excellent. Never ever have I been disappointed. The oxtail chili fries are always a must! Try them, the mix of the different flavors! Delicious! Even my husband, who usually doesn't like 'exotic' food, was thrilled. When it comes to the burgers. I always crave the Miso Burger! It's the best of the best! . And now, go enjoy! . Very friendly and professional staff too!
