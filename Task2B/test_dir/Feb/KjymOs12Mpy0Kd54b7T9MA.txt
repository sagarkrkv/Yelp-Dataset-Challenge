They continue to have poor to mediocre food. I've never had a memorable meal here. Nice view of fountains fr patio. That's about it.
***Todd English's Olives is a reasonably priced and good option for a nice lunch in Las Vegas, but dinner here is, unfortunately, similar to many other restaurants in Las Vegas--expensive with just okay food at best***. . I enjoyed my first trip to Todd English's Olives for lunch.  The view was great though you may have to deal with cigarette smoking on the patio and the food was both good and reasonably priced (nice housemade pastas and good scallops).  Dinner at Olives did not offer the same experience.  The dining room was pretty dark and the food was very overpriced like other Las Vegas restaurants backed by well known chefs.. . The dinner menu at Olives did have similarities to Olives' lunch offerings.  There was a good mix of starters and housemade pastas (though the housemade pastas on my last trip were more my style).  For dinner, Olives nixes the lunchtime sandwiches for more substantial entrees.. . Dinner started the same as lunch--breads with olives and a variety of olive spreads.  I started with the seared foie gras, which was served on buttered brioche and garnished with spice poached pears, honeyed yogurt and crushed walnuts.  It was a mostly sweet plate especially given that the portion of foie gras was so small.  I really enjoyed the spice poached pears--nice caramelization and sweetness.  The foie gras was good and creamy, but it was just too small of a portion.. . For my entree, I had the seared scallops, which were served on truffled yukon mashed potatoes and topped with sauteed sea beans and a Cabernet reduction.  The scallops themselves were a very good quality--fresh, moist and soft.  Unfortunately, they were also quite salty.  The sides were okay but nothing special.. . For dessert, I had their chocolate molten cake, which was not the most original dessert, but it was still a very good dessert.  The cake had a good outside crust while the center was hot, rich, chocolaty, and gooey.  The cake and the warm, gooey center went very well with the okay but not great ice cream.. . Service was just okay.  It took a while to put in our order and while our server seemed pleasant, she also seemed a little distracted.. . As mentioned, dinner prices are high here.  The prices are consistent with similar quality restaurants in Las Vegas, but the entree prices here would be very overpriced in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.. . Olives' food is at the very least okay, which is actually better than a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Still, the food is not that remarkable and it comes at a very high price at dinner.  Olives is not a bad option for lunch where prices are lower and the atmosphere is nicer, but you might want to seek another option for an upscale dinner in Las Vegas.. . Olives is located in Bellagio.  Like almost all of the major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking.
My mom and I had lunch here recently.  We were there around 1130am so we were able to get a table out on the patio.  And with it being Sunday, the fountains were set off every 15 minutes.  It was quite a show, especially seeing it from the backside.  And they had the heaters on so it was comfortable outside.  . . We started off with their wonderful bread basket.  It had several types of bread in it - a soft rosemary focaccia and cheese crisps.  The bread came with a couple of olive spreads and marinated olives.  Yummy!  . . For our entrees, my mom had the burger with potato wedges.  I had the steak sandwich with onion strings.  We both enjoyed our meals.  I really liked my steak sandwich.  My only complaint was that the meat was a little tough so it was hard to eat as a sandwich.  The onion strings were very crisp and tasty.  The potato wedges my mom had were good too.  Good flavor them with a crisp outside and soft inside.. . We got soda and water refills often.  And our waiter come by often too.  Definitely a good lunch and hopefully we will be back.
The Butternut Squash Tortelli is to die for.  If I could fall in love with a food, this would be it!
I first heard of this place many years ago after that atrocious Iron Chef USA pilot showing Todd English (Captain Kirk is no Chairman!).. . The ambiance is dark and intimate, and if you're lucky you can sit on the outside under heated lames next to the Bellagio Fountain Show.. . Overall I think it's a solid three stars. Service was excellent throughout, but I think the style of the dishes tended to be a bit too salty for us and doesn't quite fit our palate.. . - The free bread comes with two types of tapenade and pickled olives.  So you get elements of salty and briny early.. . - For Appetizers we got the squid and octopus in a brown sauce with chickpeas.  The sauce was actually very good and balanced and went well with bread.  Octopus and squid both very tender - definitely share with two people!. . - Wife got the diver scallops which came four large per order - seared on one side, well seasoned and juicy.  Perfectly cooked.  The sauce (vinaigrette ?) made it a bit too salty however.  Truffle mash was decent.. . - I got their mushroom pasta, which came with like four types of mushroom with pappardelle pasta cooked al dente.  Flavors were good , but I think it went overboard with the Parmesan.  A bit too much cream too.. . - Dessert we shared a pumpkin torte that was just outstanding - it had pumpkin chips, to add texture and zing and layers of sweet and spice just like pumpkin should be.  The cake layer was thin and the whole dish was airy.  It went really well with their black coffee.
Been here twice . First time we waited 20 min before we was asked if we wanted a drink. But the food was good but very over priced. So we thought we would give it another go this time we went as a small group. They got the orders wrong the food had no taste . This  place is very over priced. This place is only still open because of its location . Wouldn't go back ever
Had dinner here on Valentines Day and we were very impressed with the menu as well as the atmosphere.. They have quite an assortment of yummy appetizers and entrees. Considering this is a fine dining restaurant in Bellagio overlooking the strip, pricing is reasonable. Definitely recommend the patio seating which has heaters and overlooks the famous water show !
Way too over-rated. 20mn wait despite reservation. Service was all about speed, we felt like we had to be out of there asap. Food was very average. Tartare was dry, papardelle overcooked... No savor. Very bad value for money, definitely not worth $240 for 2. Our only disappointing experience all week-end in Vegas.
Great location and outdoor seating was worth the wait.  The food was not! The scallops were done well, but not cleaned very well as they had sand in them. I ordered gnocchi which came raw. The pasta was raw and still stuck together. They replaced it with an order of ravioli. Unfortunately the pasta cook must have been new because these came out raw in the centers. Not worth the price.
Not that this place needs another 5-star (civilian) review but here we go! Went here for lunch a few months ago and was able to snag a table on the beautiful patio. Service was incredible.. . Went here for dinner on Sat 2/15 and while the patio was already full (I had a 5:30p reso for a week now), asked to be seated as close to the windows as possible so my parents could have a view of the fountains. Cha-ching! Request granted. Our server, Rick, and myself made great rapport and the entire staff was on top of it during our dinner. Had the malbec - definitely recommend it. The free bread is delicious and they give you as many refills as you want (the onion bread is my favorite). We also had the lobster mac & cheese & the Portobello flatbread, both recommended and both customer favorites. Dad had the chicken, and while he loved it, he was (happily) surprised by the huge portion. Mom had ravioli sans sausage and said it was delish. I had the chilean sea bass and it was perfect!. . All in all - go to Olives. Make a reservation. Get there early. Drink the wine & eat all the starters/flatbreads.
We had dinner reservations here on Saturday for my birthday. We were seated right away. I called ahead of time to see if we could get a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains, to which we were told we would need to come in get on a waiting list and told what time to come back... I think not. If we have reservations already I don't understand why I would want to be put on a waiting list, but since it was Valentine's Day weekend I understand they were fully booked. Any who, this is where my rant ends- everything else from there on out was great. We were a group of five and we had a decent table. They brought out bread for the table, which was yummy. We all got different dishes to try out and they all tasted wonderful. I would definitely recommend either the salmon/lobster pasta dish, or the Gnocchi dish. I ordered a margarita, which was SO watered down it basically tasted like lemonade with barely any alcohol content.. . For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake which was delectable.. . Overall it was a great experience. definitely glad I picked this place for my birthday.
We had a reservation for a 1:30 p.m. lunch and requested to be seated on the patio.  . . They started us off with a variety of breads we tried the octopus and squid appetizer (huge portion)...so delicious, octopus was cooked perfected, ever bite was tender.  It  was served with a chickpeas in the sauce which was so delicious.. .  we also tried the flat bread with clams. the flat bread was cooked perfectly but I think it needed a little salt. My lunch companion loved it.
Loved my lunch for two here...I made a reservation and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain show.. . loved the olive tapenade spread and the variety of bread served to the table.  . . We had the octopus /squid appetizer...it was tender, and so good I almost ordered it again for my entree.  However my taste for adventure prevailed and I ended eating the seared scalloped amazing!  and my handsome lunch companion enjoyed the steak frites.. which I enjoyed as well. great cut of meat so tender & tasty.. . I can't wait to come back and try this place again... . oh and don't forget the staff here is wonderful, amazing, on the ball folks!
We went there on valentines day - no reservation, no wait. The hostess sat us right away, and we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was super busy at that time, but the service was exceptional. Both server and the bus boy made sure we've got everything we needed. They were all friendly, professional and polite. We ordered two Bellini (one regular, one strawberry), one flat bread (fig and prosciutto), and beef carpaccio. All were winners but I couldn't believe how tender and packed in flavors beef carpaccio was. The beef was thin, and unbelievably soft. It went very well with rest of the ingredients on the plate: arugula and polenta cake. The portion was generous, and the price was moderate for vegas. Next time, we will make a reservation and sit outside patio to enjoy the fountain show.
its painful to say I wont be coming back to this place. . They have the best view & to top it off the best food BUT we had the world's worst server (especially for a fine dining) . . Were servers so we understand what he was probably thinking,  we werent one of those middle aged people dressed in suite so service probably wont matter.. but we were on a date expecting to get treated equally like the tables next to us && didnt get that at all. . our server was snobby. Unless youre middle aged, covered in diamonds and expensive watches and rings.. DONT COME HERE. Youre better off getting a to-go or eat somewhere else. I got treated better at olive garden than this place.
4.5 stars. . My experience here, from start to finish, was great. We arrived to our reservation early and sat at the bar while we waited for our table (which we requested to be outside and they were able to accommodate us if we waited til our actual time). The service at the bar was great, as were the other guests sitting there, and they even have iPads around that have the drink menu on it. . . Once our table was ready they took us to a spot on the patio that had a perfect view of the famous Bellagio fountain show.  To start we ordered the grilled octopus--it was very tasty and fresh, but needed a tad of salt which we were able to season and once we did the favors popped. For dinner I had the scallops and my bf had the short ribs. My scallops were delicious-tasty, lightly seasoned and meaty. My boyfriend loved his dish as well. Service was also great, and we were not rushed at any point during our meal which I was really happy about. . . Olives is definitely worth a visit and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone----but also make sure to sit on the patio to watch the fountain show as it's really awesome to see up close.
Absolutely the best view of the bellagio fountains and the food and service are amazing. Dont skip the green beans.
This place had the perfect seating to the dancing waters fountain show at the Bellagio. . . We had good service; Great wine & food. Who knew that Butternut Squash Tortellini could be so good & savory? I had gotten a wonderful sandwich and enjoyed the Olive tapenade. It was a very refreshing meal among good people.
