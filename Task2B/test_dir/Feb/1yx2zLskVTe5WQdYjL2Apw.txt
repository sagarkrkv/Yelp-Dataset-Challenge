Great place for that comforting desire of the south west. Service staff is friendly and accommodating. There are regulars left and right due to the variety of food served. One can order the American eggs and toast with a side of fruit as well as the Belgium waffle that is crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.. Their house banana muffin is awesome! Their potato fries and squares have an seasoningthat has just enough flavor in it to mix perfect with your eggs. . We had an excellent experience and will most definitely go back.
This place is horrible. There was five in our party and four of us got waffles and the other one got biscuits and gravy. This gravy was so salty that she couldn't eat it. The potatoes are way too overly season salted also. It tasted like they dumped that whole container of salt in the gravy but when we complained about it to them they didn't apologize or anything, three different wait staff just simply said, "Oh we get that a lot. " One even said that everyone that gets it complains but no one here is going to actually tell the owner/cook that it tastes horrible and that no one likes it except the owner.  Service was slow, we had to ask several times for some items. Not sure why this place gets so many stars.
Anytime I am in Vegas, I ALWAYS stop by the egg and i.. . I don't like eating breakfast, esp. for breakfast... but I'll make an exception for the Egg and I.... My fav dishes are any from the 'mexican section'... but you can't go wrong w/ any dish here.  They have the 'most bestest' home fries ever!!!! Most of their plates come with a side of home fries.. . There's always a line anytime I come, but it usually goes fast.
This place was just ok... over priced for what you get. If you want a really good breakfast spot try coffee pub!!
I am very please with this place. I ordered the chile relleno omelette & I could not believe how delicious it was. A lot of places take a wack at Mexican which usually ends up tasting like nothing more than Pace picante tossed on top; not this plate! I can't call it authentic but it's pretty close! We also tried the chicken fried steak & eggs, yummy!! It was nice to sit Outside on their patio and enjoy the Day I'll be back!
Solid breakfast, a local hangout.  It does have outdoor seating.  Breakfast is always good and the place always accommodates changes in the menu.  I do like it and come back again and again with my parents, who have been coming here since the 80's.  The service is always good.
So we slept in and missed the breakfast buffets, that left us looking for good local food and bingo! we found Egg & I. Great friendly service, good food, just what we needed, thanks for the hospitality. It was a little chilly but we wanted to be outside on the patio so they pulled over one of the fabulous patio heaters and we were warm and toasty and well feed.
Eggcellent! We've been twice and enjoyed every bit of this great breakfast place! The place is packed and there is always a wait, but 15 minutes of my time is fine by me as long as I am going to enjoy the food. If you know my reviewing you will see that service, and location are not heavy factors in my rating. I am a total foody, so what is most important is the taste, the quality, and selection of foods offered. What I ordered this time was the Bandito omelette, I enjoyed it. The last time I ordered the Chile relleno omelette, it was delicious! I liked it more than the Bandito. it came with a banana but muffin, which I finished even I told myself to fight the temptation. my kids ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, I forget the name of it but it was stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries. they wanted to lick the plate. When we go to Vegas we won't have to think twice about it, we will be there.
I think this place has the best breakfast in town. If you go expect a small line except on Sundays. Then its a big line.
Great locals spot. You can tell by all the Nevada license plates outside. The food is hearty. They specialize in guess what? Eggs! I had the corned beef and hash, expecting the can-type, which I hoped for, but it's good, high quality corned beef with hash. The eggs are cooked well. The scramble was pretty good too. Oh yea, and with the check-in you get to try their infamous banana nut muffin. It's pretty good, the muffin top rivals that of Souplantation. Yum!
