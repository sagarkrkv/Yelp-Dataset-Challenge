I can't say enough about the amazing dinner I attended for their 10th Anniversary on Jan 27, 2014. Started out with us getting our pictures taken for a keepsake, was a nice touch. Then onto an hour of the most amazing canapes that included:. . Gruyere cheese gougeres. Foie gras terrine with orange marmalade. B.L.T. Dungeness crab salad. Salmon tartare. . These were all delicious, but my personal favorites were the Foie Gras and the Dungeness Crab Salad. They were never ending, one of the servers kept coming back to me because he picked up on my two favorites, I literally ate a healthy serving of both.  Also served during the hour was unlimited Billecart-Salmon Brut Champagne MV. Servers made sure our flute was never empty.. . Moving onto our assigned seats, we were then given a table full of more food;. . Huitres. Olives Marinees. Assiette de Charcuterie. Rillettes aux Deux Salmon. . Served with a glass of Pastou Sancerre, La Cote de Sury 2011. I'm a big Sancerre fan, this wasn't good, but the the rest of the plates were pretty good, charcuterie being the table favorite.. . Onto the Salad of Maine lobster, Dungeness crab, bay scallops, Bouchot mussels, prawns served with sauce gribiche. This was probably one of the top seafood salads I've ever had. Dinner could've stopped here and I'd be ok. It was phenomenal. Salad was served with Christian Moreau Chablis 2012.. . We then chose between sauteed Scottish Salmon or Slow Roasted Rib Eye. I've had their Scottish Salmon before so I went with the Rib Eye.  Equally as fanstastic as the rest of the food, and it was huge. I couldn't finish it. Main entree was served with Deyrem-Valentin Margaux 2009.. . Dessert, my favorite meal. Chocolate Sponge Anniversary Cake with vanilla bean bavarois & fromage blanc ice cream. Served with the most delicious  dessert wine, Domaine Cazes, Rivesaltes Ambre 1996.. . I was stuffed and just when I thought they couldn't possibly bring more food, Mignardises, a full plate. . . We were also given a "goodie bag" to take home that included a signed menu from Chef Keller, a box of macarons, and bag of shortbread cookies and a copy of Finesse magazine. . . My night was topped off with a picture with Thomas Keller, he was gracious enough to oblige my request. Awesome night.
This place has odd hours so it took a few tries to get to eat here. I had some fairly standard bistro fare which I'm likely to order anywhere. Bouchon makes the grade when compared to my favorites. I had oysters, a frisee salad with egg and a deviled egg on the side. Everything was excellent in French bistro style which makes me so happy inside. The bread and butter are worth gaining a pound for so don't resist. Wine selection was good. Chamapagne- maybe a bit overpriced but they know people in Vegas will be in the mood. Well played, Bouchon. Our servers were fantastic and full of good information, like how to get to the pool from their back door.
I finally got the chance to try out Bouchon and I was not disappointed at all.. . 5 Stars for their service. 5 Stars for the food. 5 Stars for the ambiance. . At Bouchon, you're definitely treated like a Duke or Duchess.  Your bread is kept full, your drinks kept filled, and your table kept clean.  I assume that they watch your table like a hawk or have special powers because whenever our waiter was needed, one was at our table without even having to wave one down.  Service is important to me and their timing with everything was impeccable.  . . Now for their food..... . The Pastry Basket: You get to select what 4 items you want in your pastry basket.  We chose their pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissant), a plain croissant, raspberry beignets, and a scone.  Both croissants were flaky, tasty, and had a buttery taste to them.  I thought that the beignet was just okay and their scone was phenomenal.  I could eat 10 of these in one sitting.  Don't dare me, I will.  The scone just breaks and melts in your mouth.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=D6VMKEvKSRDmL3Yft3EoPQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ). . Chicken & Waffles: I just had to give their Chicken and Waffles a try since it was my first time here.  Fellow Yelp Bud, Rodney H, recommended this and I was hit with the some of the best chicken and waffles that I have ever had.  You can't go wrong with this order.  Usually the waffles is the highlight of a chicken/waffle dish.  Here at Bouchon, they didn't skimp on taste with their chicken, which made it tough for me to decide what was better, the chicken or the waffle.  The chicken was seasoned and prepared just right.  Combine the great tasting chicken with their waffles (crispy on the outside, moist on the inside) and you're left wanting seconds. Take my recommendations...get the Chicken & Waffles.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wG5czHVCRBod8yOR25gCSQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ). . . Ambiance:  . We were lucky and caught Bouchon at a great time. The restaurant was empty and quiet for a Sunday morning.  Look around and Bouchon's French setting makes you forget you're even in the Venetian.  . . Price:. The great service, food, and ambiance doesn't come with a Denny's or IHOP price tag.  The pastry basket, my chicken & waffles, and the gf's dish (Croque Madame) came to about $60 before the tip.  But in my opinion, this is not expensive at all because you get what you pay for.  Heck, it's a lot cheaper than flying out to Paris for this.  . . Overall, I had this place bookmarked for some time now. I wasn't disappointed and look forward to trying out their dinner menu. Bouchon, you're a hit and can't wait to come back. . .

French breakfast.  One of the best breakfasts you will eat.  However, you have to be Indiana Jones to find the place in the Venetian.  Seriously....you have to go up an elevator after walking down a long corridor.  Then you see some guy standing behind a podium dressed nicely and I believe his only job is to point to his right....because he knows everybody that comes down that elevator is looking for Bouchon.  Then you have to dodge a huge boulder and the natives attempting to blow dart you.. . But once you dust off the cob webs and make it through in one piece, you are in for a treat.  Actually you can get a basket of treats.  Seriously....they have a basket of danish (well I guess it isn't danish since it is a French restaurant), a basket of baked goods.  They are baked that day without a doubt because the freshness is there.  The type of confections that crumble when you touch them.  That is how you know you are about to eat something that is greater than anything else.  Now let's talk about the ambiance.  The restaurant looks like an upscale bistro.  It appears to be classier than another favorite French spot Mon Ami Gabi, and it seems it has a quieter feel as well.  Probably because half the patrons starved to death before making it to the restaurant.  . . However!  It is worth the sacrifice of life and limb.  The breakfast portions are huge.  The omelet is amazing.  The boudin sausage with eggs is an excellent choice.  The french toast is also a great choice as well.  You must realize that it is bread pudding style and not the type you may be accustomed to.  But that just means you need to try it more.  People need to experience different things in life.  People need to be challenged.. . Here is your challenge:. Prepare for your trek to the restaurant by first visiting the man at the General Store (just like the game Oregon Trail).  Purchase some head of oxen, crates of food, and have a doctor in your party so nobody dies of drinking typhoid water while out on the trail.  Once you see the scarecrow attendant that points you to the right, give him a thumbs up and allow him to call his family.  I am certain they have not seen him in years.  Once you make it to the restaurant your next goal is to enjoy the food (which shouldn't be hard).  But how do you get home?
Yes I'm a FAN of this place....And I will definitely be back at least once a Year, since this is in LV and I live in LA.  . . The Environment was perfect, I felt like I was in a Cruise Ship or something like that...during a fancy dinner even though my friends and I had Brunch there.  The setup was Nautical like.. and the Service at the Bar where we sat, were great.  We got there maybe an hour before closing and they still attended to us like we had a few more hours.. . The food was Good and Tasty...  We had the Corn beef hash and Chicken/waffles.
Went to bouchon with a group for dinner. I guess I'm only giving it three stars because at that price point I would go elsewhere and because it didn't quite meet expectations which were admittedly high expectations.. . We started with some cocktails which were very well made, strong and with great flavor. They also served bread and some excellent spread - I believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb. I would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if I could. Honestly, for me, it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal.. . For an appetizer I gota squash soup which was quite tasty, but I've had better squash soups at Michael Mina, Circo, Mastros, etc. which are roughly the same price range. Again, it was good though, the flavor was there and the consistency was very good.. . My entree was the braised short rib. This was the other highlight of the meal. It was cooked to perfection - soft, tender, melt in your mouth good. And unlike many other nice places, they didn't skimp on the sauce they put around it which I was very pleased about. The rest of the plate left something to be desired though, it came with some greens and as I recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein.. . Desserts were entirely forgettable. As is the case with so many nice places and group meals they don't actually ask or provide desserts, but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form. This is always so disappointing because if there's something good, there's so little of it. But to be honest, there wasn't much good, plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams.. . For me, Bouchon is good, but I'd rather go to one of the Strip's many other top restaurants.
food was decent, at least what I got is good, steak and egg; but price is steep too.. $25 for small steak and 2 egg. Since its delicious I won't complain.. but wife got pork chop with egg, which it turn out to be just 3 slice of ham and 2 egg... that's $25 too.. that is not worth the money.... We will return but will definitely stick to the popular dishes..
Bouchon is practically perfect in every way.. . It's a beautiful restaurant, with high ceilings, booths upholstered in blue velvet, and an impressive display of fresh shellfish on ice. The service is nearly impeccable.. . We went for brunch, which, I think, is my favorite meal at Bouchon. When you sit down, they bring a baguette that is just fantastic, with ramekins of butter and apricot preserves. Bread and butter is one of my favorite things to eat anyway, but when it's superlative bread and exceptional butter, it's one of the very best things.. . One of the specials was Country Hash (potatoes, Merguez sausage, red peppers, red pepper hollandaise), and it was savory and earthy and really, really good.. . The Croque Madame was fantastic as well--your traditional grilled ham and cheese sandwich, on buttery brioche, topped with a perfectly cooked egg, and sauce Mornay (a cheesy cream sauce). . . I've been saving the best for last--the Chicken & Waffles. I'm not sure that it's really chicken (if it is, it's a very petite chicken), but you're served a breast, thigh, and leg of perfectly roasted chicken. The skin is browned and crisp, and the meat is juicy and flavorful. The bacon and chive waffle is light and fluffly. They bring the condiments on a separate place--vanilla bean butter, sauce Chasseur (a gravy-ish brown sauce with mushrooms and shallots), and maple syrup. Heaven!
Location #3, literally on the strip.  Larger collection than the upstairs window near Buddy Vs and similar to that tucked behind the Venezia escalators, but with outdoor seating akin to Rockefeller Center.  Near Walgreen's.
One ofthe most amazing brunch meals I have experienced to date was enjoyed at Bouchon Bistro in Las Vegas. The Croque Madame leaves me without the proper words to describe how beyond perfect the sandwich is. The brioche bread grilled with exactly the right blend of butter and cheese, making it slightly crunchy and not too crisp. The ham and cheese are melted together impeccably. The sandwich is topped with a fried egg, which I requested over hard, and finally, the rich mornay sauce brings the dish together. One of the largest servings of French fries I have seen accompany the meal, crispy and flavorful.. . We visited Bouchon a few days prior and I enjoyed the Quiche Lorraine. This dish was also exquisite, beautifully creamy and rich. The side of bacon arrives in its own dish, and deservingly so, as it is a huge serving!. . Service at Bouchon is pleasant and attentive. The ambiance of the restaurant is comfortable, and not excessively casual. I enjoyed our visits to the restaurant and am happy we do not have one local, otherwise, I'd be in trouble!
10 Star - service. 10 Star - food. 10 Star - experience . 2 star - other patrons (people just don't know how to have fun). . . Absolute food perversion. Possibly the BEST restaurant in Las Vegas. We had a 4 hour experience here and I dream about this place all the time. You better be ready to pack on the calories and please do not bring anyone who pushes their food on the plate. Bring people who love a true dining experience. . . I've tried foie gras - which I said I would never because it is just so inhumane, but it was absolutely amazing. I will never have it again, however I can say that it was the best thing I have tasted in a long time and preparation was the key. This was on the specials menu so I am not sure how often they have this specific item.. . Oysters, dover sole, NY strip, hanger steak, gnocchi, roasted veggies, 2 bottles of Northern Rhone wine..... heaven. Just heaven! . . The steaks and sides come with bechamel sauce which was just too much for me at one point, in terms of creamy fatty things, so the chef prepared me a delicious shallots and wine reduction steak sauce, which was absolutely amazing. . . The chocolate dessert we didn't care for, possibly because we have just gorged ourselves with insanely delicious foods. . . If you are looking to spend a ton of money on the best meal ever, this is the place. Our tab was about $500 (with tip) for 3 people.
This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! The service is untouchable, this is truly a dining experience. Whether you are dining here for brunch or dinner, Buchon will not disappoint. The GM Andy goes above and beyond to make you feel special every time you walk through the doors, champagne in hand until your table is ready, wine pairing recommendations, superb menu. Go there!
Had a very nice valentines day dinner here and we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or out on the patio  we chose the patio area it was an amazing view. I ordered  the Duck confit it was absolutely delicious!  Had a glass of moscato to accompanied my meal my date had the filet mignon..  And the end we were given complementary chocolate covered strawberries very sweet! I do recommend to make a reservation this is a great place for a nice date or a get together with colleagues and friends.
Amazing place for brunch!. . I really could gush all day about how wonderful an experience it was to dine at Bouchon. Start to finish it was a flawless meal. From service to location to the meal itself, I couldn't have been more satisfied.. . To start, I must give a personal section of this review to our server Doug. Sir, you understand what people are looking for from waitstaff during their dining experience; calm, charming, attentive, and knowledgeable. All the right notes to leave a pair of ladies never feeling bothered or frustrated, and wishing they had more time to visit again. . . Next, location. Although I found Bouchon a bit difficult to find - had to ask for directions - I was very pleased with it's quiet location after arriving. Instead of being among the hussle and bussle of the rest of the The Venetian, Bouchon is tucked away from the traffic of The Grand Canal Shoppes and casino. The perfect location for my taste, especially if I'm visiting before my first cup of coffee. ;) . . Last, but far from least, the meal. Being that my mother and I visited during the brunch hours, we both partook in one of the hot beverages to start. I opted for my go-to latte, and my mother chose the hot chocolate. Both were perfectly heated and offered balanced chocolate to milk or espresso to milk ratios, in both our opinions. I definitely wouldn't mind starting more days with one of those lattes, for sure! For our entrees, my mother ordered the Belgian waffle and I ordered the special of rock shrimp hash. Sadly, she didn't give me one bite of waffle (so greedy!), but the hash was superb. The shrimp were sweet and abundant, the sauce was amazing sopped up with the toast points, and the potatoes were nicely crisped. Absolutely no complaints.. . I'm so glad I got to experience Bouchon on my most recent visit to LV. The hype is truly an accurate portrayal of this gem of a restaurant.
Hands down the best meal we've had in Vegas. I could write a novel on how delicious it was, but you really need to go taste for yourself. The bread, the wine, the meal, the dessert... just... yum. We went here for my husband's birthday, and I've been dying to go back ever since. I especially love that it's not on the casino floor, so you feel somewhat far from the maddening crowd. . . If you want to splurge on a meal in Vegas, splurge on this one!
After coming to Bouchon for our friend's birthday a month ago, my wife and I knew that when we came back for Valentines Day weekend, we would go back. Both occasions, we had brunch. Even though they don't take reservations for weekend brunch, the wait of approximately 30 minutes, didn't bother us at all when waiting in this gem, housed in the Venetian. . . Ordered the chicken and waffles on the waiters request, and it was absolutely delicious. Pair that with coffee and finishing the meals with the beignets have our day a perfect start. . . Service, quality and the feeling of not feeling like we are in Vegas, makes Bouchon a must visit every time we do visit Vegas.
absolutely everything that i put in my belly - from the bananas foster pancakes to the lobster and crab benedict to the raspberry danish was fantastic and fabulous.  a perfect way to start my vegas mini-vacation.
If you wish to be completely ignored, this is the place for you. . . Left due to complete lack of service while others that came in after were served..  . Checked Trip Advisor as well. The lack of service and dismissive staff are definitely a consistent issue here. . . Go anyplace other than this. . . Chef Keller I expected better than this. . . Perhaps Chef Colicchio can stop by and offer your staff some training. We experienced top notch service at Craftsteak.
Do you want to be treated like you are not worthy from rude, dismissive, staff. Then head straight to Bouchon because you will get your fill.  Not having made reservations, we understood the wait would be long. However, it took 10 minutes to be waited on to order coffee from the bar area. After 15 minutes we still did not receive a drip coffee. Others who came in after us received service. When my husband asked, the bartender was incredibly rude.  When we told the hostess, she looked at us like a deer caught in headlights. Obviously they have no customer service training.
Best breakfast in Las Vegas.  If kings eat breakfast, this is how they do it.   Perfect coffee.  Pastries beyond compare.  The homemade corned beef hash redefined the meal for me.   Looking forward to eating dinner there.
phenomenal European brunch.  fluffy omelets with fresh ingredients and sparkling wine drinks made for the morning (my French 75 was excellent).  The bread was fresh, the croissants light and fluffy, and the fruit was good.  I haven't had a brunch this good in years.
Food (we had dinner) was good but overpriced for the quality level, but that is to be somewhat expected on the Strip. If you're looking to dine here purely for the food, you can find better values elsewhere in Vegas. On the plus side, it's a nice space and it was fairly easy to get a reservation even during peak hours. Lastly, our server was really nice and packed us a bunch of extra rolls when we took home the leftovers, which was great for the next day.
I'd heard good things about this restaurant but it was really disappointing. The food was fine but it wasn't what it should be for the price. Soup and entrees were okay-- at these prices, they really should be more than okay.
it's definitely a good meal, but i didn't think it was a great meal. first, as for the service, the waiter brought the wrong entree to our table and was hesitant to take it back when we informed him. weird..... . anyway, i had the steak frites, which was good enough, but that's usually a safe choice wherever it's ordered.. . i'm not sure i *NEED* to return. i wouldn't mind going back, but i wouldn't miss it.
I really enjoyed the brunch I had at Bouchon when I went last year. I don't head out to Vegas often, but when I did go out there, I had heard that the Vegas restaurant was the best. So coming into the restaurant was quite nice in that it's located inside the Venetian hotel(of which on it's own is a nice hotel). The restaurant itself Is a nicely decorated and bright place allowing for lots of natural sunlight to enter through the large windows. . . I had the corned beef hash plate, and it was really really good! It's homemade and served with a fried egg on top, served in a personalized metal pan with a side of toast.  The waiter was professional and provided me individualized Tabasco containers for my party. . . I'd recommend Bouchon to anyone looking for a nice place to have brunch. Just be aware it's not a cheap brunch place but I'm sure you'll enjoy their foods that also include killer pastries.
My favorite spot on the strip. Escargo, steak frites, and lamb are all amazing options. Staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Would recommend making a reservation.
Oh my goodness! Eat here for every meal, I wish I had listened to that. I regret that I didn't get to go back for dinner, don't have regrets. . I was sat at a cute tablenear the windows that overlooked the garden pool area. Opening the menu I was immediately whisked away to France. Ooh la la the choices ALL looked so tempting! Remembering it was breakfast I happily decided on a Latte and the Croque Monsieu with pommes frites. Wow. It was amazing. Everything was cooked & seasoned perfectly. I just couldn't stop eating the pommes frites. I even had the mornay sauce on the side to dip my frites in! (Thanks to my server for that gem of an idea) The portions were perfect. To travel I ordered the raspberry beignets - an extremely good idea!. The service was top notch and I adored the french bistro decor so quaint and yet chic!
Service 8/10 . Food 9/10. . Truffled Mac and cheese amazing!. Foie was excellent'. . 2 mains could have been better..short rib special and the rib eye
