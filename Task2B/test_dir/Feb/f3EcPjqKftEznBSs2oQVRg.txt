Way back  Pure used to be cool. Or maybe I just didn't know any better. The layout is really horrible. If u are not doing vip dont expect to be able to dance or . even move. Don't waste your time with the long lines..really NOT worth it.
Carol W and I were in town to get married.  Since much of the weekend's festivities were taking place at Caesars, we reserved a table at Pure for a celebratory night out with friends before our wedding day.  We checked in at the VIP station and were led on a circuitous path through the spacious, yet somewhat unremarkable looking, club to a table in a roped off section just off of the dance floor that easily accommodated our party of 9.   . . While I won't go as far as to say that bottle service was a complete rip-off, prices were truly exorbitant and more than I'd want to pay under normal circumstances.  However, this wasn't a normal Friday night for us and we were willing to pay for the experience.  Having a reserved space to call our own free from the masses in the crowded club was very nice.  It was also very nice to receive first-rate service from the attractive and attentive staff.  Drinks were poured and mixers and ice were always replenished at will.   The only negative of the night was the music or, more specifically, the DJ whose R&B/hip-hop set could only be described as ADD-like appealing to those that like to dance to 30-second sound bites.  No sooner had he gotten the crowd moving, he made a jarring switch in songs that made for a disjointed night of dancing.  The music got much better after midnight (I'm assuming a different DJ took over) when the music switched to a more consistently danceable EDM mix.      . . Pure offered up a decent night, but nothing that isn't being done bigger, bolder, and better elsewhere in Las Vegas.
VALENTINES NIGHT 2014. . I came here Friday night. The layout of the club is has a elegance decor. The vibe here is pretty chill. Being in Vegas you encounter people from out of state. That's why I prefer going to nightclubs out of state versus those locally. The drinks were too expensive. The dance floor is smaller than normal nightclubs. For a large crowd this makes the dance floor cramped. The music in terms of its energy and tone was uneven. Normally a review like this would at least get a 3-star rating.  So why a higher rating? Per my tip I signed up to be on the guest list through www.cheapvegasclubs.com for $15 per person. When I got there my friend and my name wasn't on the list. I showed one of the Pure staff an email from this vendor. One of them said they don't use this vendor anymore because they're a scam. It appears the names on the vendor's supposed guest list don't transfer to the Pure guestlist. The Pure staff could have not let my friend and me inside Pure or they could've insisted that we pay $40 each to enter Pure. After twenty minutes the Pure staff let my friend and me inside the nightclub without paying an extra charge. For this gesture Pure gets an extra star.
Good club. Good music. Has two levels. On on the roof top. It has decent view of the strip on the roof. Normal high vegas priced drinks. Bartenders were cool. Wasn't a super long wait for how many people where there. Go VIP and you dont have to wait in a line long at all.
Well it's located in Caesers so it's got that working against it.. Everything in this place needs a re-vamp, including this nightclub.. . Anyway, me and my girl went on a Thursday night or something so there was no line really. We got put in VIP immediately, which is an elevated area above the regular dance floor. The barrier is made of glass, so everyone on the dancefloor will inevitably get an upskirt shot. Being the elegant demure pearl that I am, thankfully, I was wearing panties. No one should go full clam. Especially at Pure.. . The barrier is high enough to flash everyone your goods, but not high enough to keep the uncouth young gentlemen from climbing from the dancefloor to VIP. Security was not on their game and did not stop them. . . The music they played was hip hop, therefore dancing was possible. Sort of. It gets very very crowded in there, being that the place is so cramped. We still had fun though, and got pretty drunk of the Skyy special they had going on. . . I would go back, but its for sure not my first choice.
This club is closed down for renovations!!
