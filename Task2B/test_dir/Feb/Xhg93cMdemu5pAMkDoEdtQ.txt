This place was great!!! There is construction going on right now but still had a wonderful breakfast. The vanilla latte was the best I've ever had. I got to taste me friends frozen hot chocolate, amazing!!! It's a cute atmosphere too. Can't wait to go back.

How can something be so overrated. Just came here for dessert to try out the much talked about frozen hot chocolate. Ordered the double frozen hot chocolate for two which was $15 and upon its arrival, I was immediately disappointed. How can people rave so much about shaved ice, hot chocolate powder, and whipped cream? Is it because they're on the Vegas Strip and they know people will come and pay $11 and up for something so simple. I'd rather have some cold stone or baskin and Robins ice cream. I don't know what the food is like, but if you're intrigued about this frozen hot chocolate dessert and you're so eager to try it like I was, Go Somewhere else.
Finally after living 5 years in New York and never making it to serendipitys, I got to try the one in Las Vegas! Delicious! Had the famed frrrozen hot chocolate and it was scrumptious. Basically a milkshake but yummy. Didnt like that is was $11 but its Vegas so what can you do? Still would recommend it to everyone!
Not up to par as our last experience there. Food was just mediocre and the wait staff although busy was not pleasant this time. Might just be a bad day . We went on a friday morning. really was surprised.
Well I get this place is busy.   But you shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for coffee.   The portions are a great size but alot of the dishes lacked flavor.   The manager was super rude when we were trying to be helpful with giving up one of our chairs we didn't need.   The only bonus was our server who never frowned or was rude  he was completely upbeat and knew  the menu.   The corn beef hash had no flavor and the the eggs were over cooked.   The potatoes my friend got were the last crumbs and she didn't get any real potato.  The saving grace was the amazing server and dessert.
Can you say frozeeeeen hot chocolate?? The frozen hot chocolate is so yummy!! Last year on four square if you check in, you can get a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate if you spend $10+ and have your total rewards card! I don't know if that promo is still going on for this year.... . Anyways, the prices here are fair... a little on the pricier side, but not bad for what you get. As far as other food... it's pretty good, but not the greatest. Portions are about average, kind of small for the price. Sometimes food here can take a long time to come out. . . The wait for a table can get pretty long sometimes... but there is a to-go window if you prefer that. I've never ordered from there before though. Service here isn't the greatest, but it's not bad either. Personally, I would come here just for the frozen hot chocolate. There are many different flavors. I always get the coffee one and it's never disappointed me.
This place is cool...really cool spin on how old traditional meals are prepared.  Tourisity , kindve expensive...but the portions are huge and the food is delicious...so...its a win win.
it was ok
BBQ burger was ok atbest. Nothing spectacular. Everything seems overpriced. They offer a burger and frozen hot chocolate at $25, so that's what I got, considering I was only coming just for the frozen hot chocolate and a regular size is $11. I also was able to try the steak sandwich, which was amazing but super messy and difficult to eat as a sandwich. Service was mediocre even though the restaurant wasn't busy. But the frozen Oreo hit chocolate was absolutely to die for!! All in all, come here just for the frozen hot chocolate. Don't waste your money on the food.
Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate is great! Get 3 of them!
I'm surprised by the bad reviews. We were seated immediately on a Sunday for brunch and had excellent service through out. Everyone at the table ordered something different and everything was wonderful. I ordered the fried eggs Benedict and it was the best breakfast I've ever had. I expected the price since it's a more touristy spot. Would definitely come back!
Food was terrible. The chicken wraps are almost inedible. Crab and artichoke dip was missing one ingredient, CRAB!. Ordered a tex mex chicken salad, took two bites and couldn't eat any more. Ordered decaf coffee and I think it was from yesterday. Don't waste your money...unless you are going for dessert. It looked amazing.
The worst customer service EVER! No one smiles. No one goes out of their way to make the experience nice. We had to wait for our party to arrive so the waitress suggested that we wait by the bar. Then the bartender told us we had to leave because we didn't want to drink until the rest of our party arrived. The food was ok. Nothing special. The only things that made the trip to this restaurant worth it was the dessert. We had fried Oreos and they were divine. Overall I'd give this place half a star if I could.
It's more of a novelty coming here especially if you want the Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I split the FHC for $15. There are far better desserts to buy on the strip, even at 5 star restaurants, for that price and less. Something to consider.. . To sum it up, the drink is an iced chocolatey drink. It's pretty decent although if you're really into it, there's an exact knock off of this recipe listed on food network. Google it. You're welcome. . . The whipped cream on top was delicious, almost my favorite part of the drink. It's about a 1:1 ratio iced chocolate drink to cream. Before we dove in, my friend mentioned she should have asked them for no whipped cream. Excuse me? Who are you? . . The chocolate chips that topped off the drink were not good at all. The worst I've ever tried but the rest of the drink made up for it. . . All in all, I tried it and I'm done and I have no interest in ever getting it again.
Since Caesar's is one of my favorite casinos, I love coming here to eat.. . The food here is amazing. The ahi tuna salad knocked my socks off (I was actually shocked how fresh the ahi was) and their desserts are heavenly. The frozen hot chocolate is definitely one for your bucket list!. . Our waiter, Brian, was super friendly, entertaining and funny and made great suggestions on the menu. . . Like any restaurant on the strip, it's always a bit crowded, so if you plan on a sit down, plan ahead. Expect the service to be a bit slow because of the heavy traffic.. . My main complaint is about the seating inside. The chairs were sooooooo uncomfortable. I found myself shifting around just to try to enjoy my meal. They seriously look and feel like they came out of a McDonald's. My ass hurt at the end of our dinner. Next time I'm opting for ordering at the window and sitting on the concrete benches outside, which is a shame cause the wall decor inside was cool. Dear manager: for the love of god please change these!!!!!!!
amazing i love the drinks on friday i go for the specials:)
I come here for one thing. The Deep fried Oreo cookie Sunday. . . 5 deep fried Oreo's, super premium cookies and cream ice cream, homemade hot fudge, marshmallow sauce, whipped cream. I like to add peanut butter sauce to mine. . . I COULD eat all of it, but have always shared it. It is big enough for 2. . . At $15 one would balk, but this is truly a masterpiece of a dessert. I have tried the frozen hot chocolate and it's good, but tastes like something you can get at any coffee joint. . . Ihave seen much of the food from here and it all looks good. Those onion ring stacks are impressive. . . The 4 stars is for the Deep fried Oreo cookie Sunday only.
Overpriced crap.
I didn't want to give a not-so-stellar review...but it was too easy. EVERYTHING fellow yelpers say is true. SLOW service. We sat at our table for over 15 minutes before I stopped someone to find out who our server was. ANNOYING. I am a server so I'm pretty lenient, but this was unacceptable. The fish tank? GONE! Might wanna put that in somewhere on the website. The whole reason we went there and my nephew was heartbroken :(  Ice cream for 4 kids and 1 round of cocktails for 4 adults....$$$$$$  PASS!
OMG, way way overrated!!! It was really that bad that I couldn't even remember what was ordered. I got some kind of ice cream and it was expensive!! I rather eat gelato somewhere else.
Bring a friend to share the desserts. Or two friends. You'll need 'em. Btw, if you're feeling really crazy, there's a 100 USD treasure chest of sweets.....Omg, I was so tempted.
When my boyfriend and I went to Vegas for the first time, I was so excited to finally eat here. While he went out gambling one night, I treated myself to dinner.. . After being seated at a two-top by myself, I waited for approximately fifteen minutes before ANYONE stopped. No menu, no drink order, nothing. His first words to me were "Oh, are you here by yourself?!" He was apologetic and said he was just sure I was waiting for someone. Finally, he said he'd be my date for the night.. . I love banter, and normally this would have been great, but something upset me about him constantly insinuating that there was something wrong with me for eating alone. Surely that can't be that uncommon in Vegas.. . My dinner was lackluster. I ordered a chicken and pasta dish and was not even remotely impressed. This is not to say it was bad by any means! I just expected it to taste better than the Olive Garden. I understand this is a restaurant geared towards dessert, so that's fine. . . I had a drink called something like "Alcoholic Girl Scout Cookie" and it was good. I never would have guessed that there was alcohol in it, because I couldn't taste it and it did nothing for me. Oh well.. . I remember dessert being fine. Nothing that wowed me, as I can't even remember what I had.. . Overall? You're definitely paying for the experience and being able to tell your friends you've eaten here. I still think it's a fun restaurant to stop into, but don't waste your money on dinner, focus on booze and sugar.. . And if you're eating by yourself, you should probably just order your drink straight from the bar.
I was a bit disappointed. The best thing about this place was thefrozen hot chocolate. The sweet potato fries which were $1 extra were stale and not fresh! The frozen hot chocolate was a bit pricey as we got the $15 one for 2 which didn't seem that big to me. The decor was a bit mixed, although I do understand they are going through construction right now. The pizza I ordered was good but nothing to go crazy about. I might come back just for the frozen hot chocolate.
We had the oreo frozen hot chocolate (the smaller one was enough for two of us) and the nachos. I love that the nachos had both regular melted cheese AND nacho cheese poured all over the chips. Definitely something unique that I have never seen and they were delicious. The rest of the food coming out looked good, I see a lot of bad reviews on here but it all looked and smelled tasty. The portions are definitely huge, so share if you can. I would definitely go back here in a heartbeat!
I don't know why the reviews are low but me and husband had a good experience. We were on the waiting list and they texted us when our table was ready. Our waitress was friendly food and drinks was yummy especially the frozen hot chocolate. We got the peanut butter one and it tasted like I was drinking a resses pieces. Yum
I'm here to recommend you get the B.E.C. burger! It's gigantic, but oh so tasty to help cure whatever pains you inflicted on yourself the night before. This burger cures hangovers, both the alcoholic as well as monetary ones. . . At $16 it's a pretty good value for the general money-destroying restaurants in Las Vegas. The place gets busy but you can always order out or run into Caesar's to pass the time.
Came here w a group of friends after dinner for dessert, all we ordered was ice cream and it took FOREVER for them to bring it out... I had the caramel sundae and it was really good... our server was really nice but it was ridiculous that we had to wait 30mins for ice cream... I would've left but it was my friends birthday and she really wanted to come here so I was being a good sport about it ...
great food and service
I loved this place!
First time at a Serendipity. Last time I was in NY I wanted to check it out but it didn't happen so I finally got to try out the one in LV. The frozen hot chocolate is a MUST! The food was okay but overpriced. Probably would only return for dessert.
It was wonderful. I suggest getting the Mac and cheese with bacon, that's really great and filling. The burgers are okay but the service is nice and their drinks are impressive
I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I went to this cute little spot right off the strip and took a chance - the food was bland and meh! Service was pretty basic and lousy - my cocktail was so bad I had to send it back.......I wish I just ordered dessert and a frozen hot chocolate, but I couldn't get to dessert because I lost my appetite with dinner/cocktail/service. . . Thank you - I'll pass next time - too many good spots in Vegas to hit up! Not my cup of tea, but the stripes on the walls were pretty at least!
Overpriced.. Very very rude cashier.. Never coming back to this place. Such a bad service and the food is not even good. Smh
This is a fun place with yummy, diner style  food.  The staff is quite friendly and patient as you decide which comfort burger you prefer. I like that you do not have to go into a casino to eat.
My wife and I really enjoyed this place. Yes, it is a novelty restaurant selling $15 Sundaes and $11 "frozen" hot chocolates. It's exactly the kind if place that I would normally despise. However, I'll admit, Serendipity 3 was my favorite part of my recent trip to Vegas. . . The food was very good. We split a flat bread pizza and a Marshmallow Grasshopper Hot Fudge Sundae and they were both delicious. The staff was friendly and our server was professional and clearly knew the menu like the back of his hand. . . The atmosphere is really unique. While everything else on the strip tries to out high-end-hipster-cool everything else, Serendipity 3 is a true departure.  It feels like a Fantasy Land tea party with footlong hotdogs and great ice cream (trust me, I meant that in a good way). We will definitely go back.
I love this place. The food, that atmosphere; amazing. I had a lot of fun with the party I went with. It may be a little pricey but their portions is pretty big. Their desserts is to die for. I am not a sweet tooth kind of gal, but I absolutely loved what I ordered.
This was our second time visiting this place. Last time the service was horrible, the food was good, but what brought us back was the dessert. We gave it a second try, and the food was good, service was great, and the frozen hot chocolate was so delicious. . . We got the frozen hot chocolate with almonds, and we liked it better than the peanut butter one. . . I have it four stars because the food is not as good as the dessert. My burger was dry, a bit flavorless, but the bacon was just right. The fries are seasoned better than well. The hot dogs are okay, but the pizza is amazing. . . Next time we will just stop by for the dessert, since the food is over priced for what it is.
I went a few days ago with my sister and two cousins. We were seated inside because it was windy.. . The place was kind of small, although the ceiling was high, it felt tight to get around. The decor was a little lost, like they didn't know where to go with it and right when you walk in, to your right is a souvenir shop that I didn't think needed to be there.. . For being on the Strip and with its name, me and my family expected more. The service was okay for it being busy. . . We ordered the regular sized frozen hot chocolate for $11 (Sharing for-two size it's $14) in original and oreo flavored. I didn't care for the original,  and although the oreo tasted good, I felt that this was something I could knock off at home (by just melting ice cream and blending it with ice and milk...) We also ordered the sliders off the appetizer section, it was pretty darn expensive for three, two-bite sized burgers at $14. . . Overall I think this place is just a "come once and say you have gone place."
This was our first time going and I heard great reviews. We got seated right away which was nice because it was kind of busy. It took awhile for us to get service. Once we did we ordered a frozen hot chocolate which was to die for. We also ordered the veggie burger and meatball pizza. The veggie burger completely fell apart and had a bland taste, the meatball pizza was ok but hardly any meat on it. The waiter never refilled our water and he hardly came byour table. We even saw two groups of people get up and walk out because of lack of service. All together it was an experience but not one I wish to repeat. We will however be going to the To-Go counter for more frozen hot chocolate tomorrow!
Service was good, however, Denny's makes better food than this place..ordered ribs, was pretty dry. They tried to plate it nicely but it looked more like a hot mess. Not worth $22. Also had fetuccini Alfredo pasta, pasta was over cooked. Sauce taste like canned sauce... Do they care how they serve their food here? . . Wasn't too impressed with the frozen hot chocolate either. . . Outside patio sitting area is pretty dirty as well. Not coming back here..
You come because you want to acquire bragging rights and say you've eaten here; however, there's nothing to brag about. The overpriced food is comparable to Denny's, it's crowded, the wait for the food is egregiously long and service was ok. At least I hung out with my friends. Go to the Cheesecake Factory inside the Forum Shops instead.
This is place is off the charts C U T E !!!. . I went here with my best friend for a quick casual dinner, mainly to try the infamous frozen hot chocolate.. . We both got salads and they were pretty average, but good.. . The service is out of control though, our waitress was everywhere. I felt bad for her because she seemed so frantic to accommodate everyone.. . The frozen hot chocolate basically tastes like a wendys frosty but with a more malted aftertaste. . . I'll go back the next time I'm in vegas for another frozen hot chocolate ( probably will share between 2 people)  because serendipity is so cute!
This place is a little pricy and it's pretty busy as well. Without reservation you will probably have to wait for a while. Mm I would suggest the frozen hot chocolate- that is a must try! You don't have to get anything else but you have to get this frozen hot chocolate!
Love the desserts at this place! . . I come here for a visit every time I come to vegas. The food is decent and the service was better this time than it was the last time. . . But what irked me was the restaurant had inside seating, patio seating, and a large additional outdoor seating - all with many empty tables but I had to wait 15 min for a table of four. Many other parties were waiting around as well.. . Once I was seated though, ice cream melts away my irritation. Always.
Was so excited to come try out the food for my 21st birthday an was extremely beyond disappointed. The service was terrible the guy at the windows answer to my 2 questions about the food I was ordering were simply "I don't know". Then I got my 13 dollar fries an hot dog that I ended up throwing away because the bread was so stale an dry I literally have never had bread that stale ever it was gross an me being as pissed off as I was lost my appetite an threw it all away no point in eating something that gross anyways. I don't recommend this place at all I give it -5 stars never been to a place this terrible ever.
When I come to Vegas, I make it a point to stop by Serendipity, mostly for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. This time, I also grabbed some breakfast. Strawberry frozen hot chocolate was not as good as the original, but that should be a given. $11 for a single serving of that. My Central Park omelette (egg white, spinach, Swiss cheese, and avocado) was just ehh.. Not very good for $14. But of course, it's on the strip and prices are raised, and taking into account it's on the Caesars Palace lot, prices will be high. Wait time was estimated at 45 min - 1 hour, but we were seated in 10 minutes outside, which was perfect
My breakfast tab alone was 75 bucks. The mimosas were 14 dollars each and teeny tiny. They need to let people know this. The food was meh. I get that its the strip, but there is a limit one can take.
I am reminded when I write reviews that just because a restaurant is famous for a couple or one of their items on the menu, that not everything on the menu is going to be spectacular. If only that was the case, I'm sure more restaurants would get a higher rating. With that being said, I like many yelpers absolutely LOVE and came for the frozen hot chocolate. My fiance (att) and I decided to start our strip journey by grabbing food at Serendipity and ordered the small frozen hot chocolate (that is perfect for two people, possibly a third depending on how much you eat) and a flatbread pizza that came with ricotta cheese and meatballs. Boy we're we disappointed with our main dish! There was nothing special or anything that stuck out about the crust of the pizza or the cheese/sauce, but the big disappointment was the meatball and combination of ricotta cheese. We had eaten a combination of pizza like this before at a different restaurant, which is why we choose to go with this pizza, but it could not have been a more bland taste. I believe we only got one meatball on the whole pizza. Granted, the pizza isn't very big (more like an app.), but the meatball was sliced and lacked flavor. If I had eaten the meatball alone, with my eyes closed, I wouldn't have even guessed it was meatball! The ricotta also made the pizza taste even more bland and I think we were given huge dollops of it, because they skimped out on the meatball, but with it lacking taste, I guess it didn't matter. I was very regretful that I didn't order the chicken nachos, once I took a bite of the pizza. . But the service was great. Even though it was busy, our waitress was very attentive and made sure our waters were filled up. My fiance HATES to waste food, but this was the first time that he didn't mind leaving the rest of the pizza behind. The price of the pizza definitely did not match up to the taste. . I'm going to make sure and only order the chicken nachos and a FHC next time I go!
If you want a frozen hot chocolate GO. If you're hungry-- skip! Unfortunately there food just isn't good. But man their desserts are! Go for dessert-- all desserts are over the top. Very pricey though.
This place is really nothing special. There's a better place that serves this in OC but since everyone raves about Serendipity 3, I was prepare to be blown away. Well, I wasn't. I stayed right in my spot. We got the original frozen hot chocolate. The portion was quite small and I felt like I was sipping on sweet powder. The only thing that stood out was our server, Jason. Shout out to Jason! He was very attentive and funny. We wanted to try the green tea frozen hot chocolate and he warned us it wasn't good. We asked for a sample before ordering and he happily obliged.
While we knew going in that this place was famous for desert, we still expected some decent food. After a reasonable wait for a table- it is cool that they text you when your table is ready - we sat at a very cramped table in a VERY loud room and waited some more. We were HUNGRY and immediately ordered nachos as a app. The waitress told us that the kitchen was very busy so it might be a while. She, unfortunately, was right. How hard is it to get nachos out quickly! Half an hour is a bit ridiculous! . . My husband's burger was big and cooked correctly, my son's chicken sandwich (I can't remember exactly what it was) was also large, but unmemorable. My Italian pesto pizza, also big, but not much flavor.. . Now on to the desert we had been waiting for. Bring on the frozen hot chocolate! Our server was nice enough to put a candle in it to celebrate our 14 year-old's birthday, although myson wouldn't let us sing :(  And..............nothing special. It tasted like a Wendy's frosty to me. The two person serving was not very large, and most of it was whipped cream. The whipped cream was tasty, but there was so much!. . Expensive but disappointing. At least we can say we have been there now.
I didn't know what think about this place, it seemed kind of girly but I really liked it! I tired a meatball sub and a pizza and would recommend it to anymore. It is a little pricey so if your looking for something cheap don't bother. The service was great and so was the food. I'll be coming back here again.
Huge portions, expensive, service was ok. Just order main meal and nothing else because you wont be able to finish everything. Take my word for it, im a fat guy.
Always a million-hour wait (dinner time or later) and gummy ice cream. Everything LOOKS fab, but meh. If I ever go through a horrific breakup and need to punish myself with food I'll go here and get a cookie sundae and cry in it.
Awesome Place - Great Fun - and who does not like chocolate.....LOL. Great sandwiches to boot!
