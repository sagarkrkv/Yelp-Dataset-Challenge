Under no circumstances should anyone ever stay at this hotel.  We arrived this afternoon for a three day weekend and had booked the one bedroom wrap around suite for over $2000 for three nights.  When we arrived, the hotel informed us that our suite was no longer available and instead offered us a lower quality room.  After about an hour of debate and negotiation at the check in desk, they did offer compensation, but still refused to provide the room that had been confirmed months ago when the reservation was made.  Also, rooms at Encore and Palazzo are nicer and a better value.
Stayed here in March 2013. Booked a wraparound terrace suite.. . It was amazing, service was great, the views were incredible, and overall the experience was top notch. . . Got one of the suites that faced towards Marquee nightclub and the Bellagio fountains. I was easily able to see the fountain show go off at night and see the dayclub pool party going on during the day. The wraparound balcony of this room is definitely the greatest feature. The entire length of the strip was easily viewable from the room. I would definitely recommend it and would stay here again.
I wanted to be the 2000th review.  Love this hotel. Upgrade to view of Belliago fountains :)
New favorite hotel in Vegas!! My boyfriend and I stayed in the Aria Sky Suites the last 3 trips we thought it was great until the Cosmopolitan (not in a suite) if that tells you anything.  Love Everything about this hotel and customer service was so much better. Love it!
Amazing property, but I would never stay here again. Booked three weeks ago on business and paid in full, just to get here and be told they have no rooms for us. The manager we dealt with was unhelpful and recited lines out of the company handbook like a robot. His name was Brian Askins in case you ever have to deal with him. . . Overbooking and putting people out like the airlines is no way to run a business. What a joke.
Stay was good but post charges and service is horrible!. . My husband and I love this place and it is very modern and nice hotel to stay at but our last experience was bad as they charged us extra on our credit card. We went to the hotel as my husband had a comp room offer for 2 days. We were only going to stay one night so we booked the room for Sunday night (1/19) to checkout Monday morning (1/20). We called and asked for a late checkout and they said we could at noon so we tried to checkout at 11:55 on computer and it would not work and we called the front desk and checked out. We were out of the hotel all together with our car from Valet by 12:30ish but we received a room charge of $336.01 on our credit card saying that we had not checked out on time and they charged us for an additional night. My husband called to ask about the charges on 1/27 and they said that send an email to marivic.budduan@cosmopolitanlasvegas.com and he will check and refund or call and let us know. Nothing happened after about a week of waiting, I called on 2/1 and asked about it and they said that there we no notes on our account and now the manager Pam is looking into it and will get back to me. She also mentioned that since it is Saturday, accounting is closed and so they get back to me on Monday. Of course, once again no one called or there were no refunds on my card. I called again today (2/5) and they said there are no notes once again and not sure what has happened. I was transferred to the accounting department and the lady asked me all the same questions all over again and then put me on a 17 minute hold and then finally said that they manager is putting the credit back on my account as they see that no key was ever used on that day. I think this the worst of customer service I have seen to not get back to your customer after multiple promises.. . No doubt, the hotel is nice and amazing but does not make me want to go there again after the horrible post experience.
Gross.  Chaos.  Unhelpful.  Trashy.  Rude staff at every turn.  Hundreds of dollars in billing errors after checkout.  Maybe this place was nice the first week it opened.  But now it feels like staying at a motel in New Jersey during spring break.  Stay anywhere else, literally anywhere else.
Outstanding rooms with amazing views. Staff were exceptional and vibe was vibrant. Outstanding experience rather just a hotel to sleep in.
I stayed here over Super Bowl weekend and loved it. For VIP service, they take you to a private room to check in with a cocktail bar and offer you a drink. In the hotel they have so many employees greeting you and asking if they can help you find anything. They room is extremely nice and the view was pretty. Since the hotel is more upscale, it smells less like cigarette smoke. The only thing I didn't like was having to go to the "identity counter" to create a membership so I can place a bet on the Super Bowl. It is really rare that a hotel in Las Vegas will do that. Otherwise, I loved the place!
Really great hotel! It's swanky and modern. The receptionist gave a free upgrade to the 51st floor with a terrace view. And the view was of the strip and amazing. The room is all about you. My name showed up on the key card and when you turned on the TV. There's a window from the bathroom to the bedroom which can be interesting but there is a blind you can pull down if that bothers you. The showers is huge and amazing. . . They some very cool store - all over priced but fun to walk through and great restaurants - STK, Holsteins. . . Overall a very fun stay.

I am a local and USE TO come here all the time. . It was my friends graduation. We told them we were going to have a celebration and they suggested to get a bigger room to have more space. So we booked one of the nicest rooms on the top floor and it wasn't cheap. We had about 10 people over we went to dinner and then went to the room for drinks. By MIDNIGHT (which for vegas is like 9pm) had a knock on the door saying we were too loud. So we went to tell everyone to tone it down. Not even 5 min later we had another knock for a 2nd warning! Are you kidding me?! How can we settle everyone down in less then 5min?! So we turned the music off  and seriously toned it down. 20 min later we had our 3rd warning it was ridiculous there was 8 security guards trying to escort us out! A little dramatic don't you think? It was now 1am. 1AM for Vegas!!!! It was so beyond stupid I started to record it and one of the security guards grabbed my wrist and yanked my phone out of my hand and told me I couldn't record them. First off they ARE NOT allowed to touch you in anyway unless you give them permission or under arrest. I tried to talk to a manger but they refused and said we were now crossing private property. Long story short we left. No. Actually they walked all of us out of the hotel!! I will never get a room at Cosmo again. Vegas is known to party. Their commercials are "the right amount of wrong" we were not doing anything illegal and everyone was over 21. Being a local I have been to plenty of hotel parties. Even some where there were 20-50 ppl and live DJs and not a word from security.. It's one thing to be in a tiny bedroom and being loud but  We were even in the huge luxury suite. They may be the hot new hotel on the strip. But not worth it to end a party by 1am.. Oh and not to mention that one of guards told me on the way out that he has been doing security for 20 yrs and if we wanted to have a hotel party that Hard Rock is the place to be and we won't hear a word. That Cosmo is good for the clubs and bars. But they cater to business people For their hotel rooms. . . So maybe they should change their. Commercials cause its false advertisement . come to the clubs but don't plan on sleeping there. I'll book my next hotel at Hard Rock
Stayed here the first month it opened. Definitely one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in.. . Extra large extra modern room with a big flat screen TV and another small one in the bathroom.. . Central location, fantastic gym, great view from the balcony.. . The Cosmopolitan buffet is the #1 buffet in Vegas.
Stayed at Cosmo or first time this past weekend. Overall, great experience!! From check-in to check out. . . Check-in was fast and very very friendly! I wish I got the guys name who helped me but didnt manage to get it. All I remember is that he looked like Nick Cannon ha. . . Upgraded to Terrace Suite East tower. 15th floor Belagio view. Beautiful room and view. Bed isnt as comfortable as I thought it would be but it did the job! . . Also, Marquee is right here too so why not make the best of it. . . Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Great location. . . A must go!
This is my new favorite hotel when I am headed to vegas. We stayed on the 51 floor, and wow what a view of the vegas strip, INREA. Big rooms and best of all they have a balcony that hold about 10 people. Room service never goes wrong in vegas so that went well too. But wow what an amazing hotel, and the crowd was great too. The rooms where amazing. This hotel was originally built as condo's but the converted into hotel rooms, and they look amazing. Clean rooms clean bathroom and like I said you could step outside your room and get some fresh air.
Had the pleasure of finally staying here over Superbowl weekend. The hotel is very nice (not as nice as Wynn or Encore) and better than most I've stayed at on the Strip. Got to watch the game in the Chelsea auditorium with VIP treatment including open bar and lots of free food! Great venue but the game sucked ass (bronco fan here). . Rooms are very nice except the beds were uncomfortable. Kinda felt like you were sleeping at an incline...weird. The terrace and view of the Bellagio fountain and the rest of the strip is unmatched. Great overall trip since we all won a lot of $$$ at the tables (guess unpaid for casinos still payout) ;-). Other than having to socialize with annoying seahawks, it was a fantastic experience.
I have stayed all over Vegas and the Cosmopolitan is by far the best hotel in Vegas. If you can, request the Signature Suite, 1200 square feet of fun. It is a mini-Hangover style suite, minus the Tiger.
I've stayed at the Cosmo a couple times since they opened - both great experiences! However, this past stay over Super Bowl weekend was an absolute disappointment! . . Check-in was very easy and pleasant. I gave the gentleman at the front desk the  name of a person that will be staying in the room (arriving later in the evening) - no problems. . . We arrived at the room only to be immediately greeted by a pungent smell of smoke. I called and spoke to a manager about it.  Instead of moving us to another room, he asked me to provide him with a convenient time for his staff to bring in an "ozone machine" to deodorize the space. I was speechless.. . I then go to use the bathroom, only to realize that we had NO trash cans in the ENTIRE room.  I called again. They assured me that someone was on their way to deliver new cans. We went out to grab food and gamble (2-3 hours). Arrived back - still no trash cans. Again, I called the front desk, they assured me they were on their way. 30 min later there was a knock on my door. . . We then head out to dinner. Our friend arrives at the hotel while we are out. He gives the front desk both his and my name. They give him the room key - no problems there. He then gets to the room, unpacks, showers, shaves, grabs a drink from the mini bar and takes off to meet us at the casino. Long story short...About 2 hrs later we figure out that the front desk had given him the wrong room key (directed him to the wrong room). All this time he was showering and settling in to a room that wasn't his - luckily the owners of the room hadn't returned since he had arrived. We immediately went to speak to the front desk about this - they lightheartedly apologized (as if it was funny). Not the reaction I was expecting. They brought over another gentleman who claimed to be a "manager," all he did was briefly apologize. He did not seem too interested in making sure we were satisfied. . . btw...all of this happened on my girlfriend's bday weekend. . . I expected much more from this hotel. Its as if my business didn't matter to them. Most likely won't go back in the near future.
My new favorite hotel on the strip. The staff was excellent, from every housekeeper to front desk agent to waitresses. I have been in the hotel industry for over 25 years and I tend to be a little more critical than the average hotel guest. The Cosmo is doing everything right! We were offered a comp room based on our previous trip to Vegas and signing up for players club. I figured since it was free, we would get stuck in a mediocre room which would be fine as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. We went in with little expectations and figured our time in the actual room would be minimal anyway. We arrived prior to check in time but the agent was awesome!! I wish I remembered her name...Danellye? Anyway, she let us check in early and upgraded us to a wraparound suite on high floor. The room was absolutely breath taking. It was huge and the views were outstanding! I would stay there every time, even if I had to pay for it hahaha . Thank you Cosmo for a wonderful stay
Best hotel in Las Vegas to get the entire experience in one place. Beautiful rooms for a great price! You get more than what you pay for. Great casino, great restaurants, great environment. Convenient location on the strip. Very detailed and decorated with decadent chandeliers. . . WRAPAROUND TERRACE SUITE. The most amazing view of Las Vegas that you can get from a room balcony. The glass windows literally wrap around the entire suite. Upgrade to the KING bed, so comfortable that it's worth it. Love the lighting system. Full kitchen and living room with two full bath and one bedroom. Easy check-in and check-out! Make sure you get a player's card if you're gambling. . . Food: Wicked Spoon Buffet for breakfast. french toast and omelette recommended!. Holsteins for lunch. Urth burger and El Machete burger are my favorites with onion rings or sweet potato fries!. MUST TRY RED VELVET MILKSHAKE- add the extra shot of alcohol- SO WORTH IT. . Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar . . Secret Pizzeria. Open until 4 AM so stop by whenever you have those munchies that won't go away, but good luck finding it!. . Henry's. Fast pub food to grab before leaving the hotel. Try the breakfast burrito!
Stayed at the wrap-around suite and couldn't ask for a better time. The balcony wrapped around as well and pointed toward the strip/bellagio. (Room had a full kitchen, washer and dryer and a huge living room. . . The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had some minor issues with the heat.... . Overall, great hotel with one of the best clubs in Vegas (Marquee) and the location is perfect, center of all the action on the strip.
Read carefully:  Do not stay anywhere else in Vegas.  The Cosmo is BY FAR the best hotel you will encounter in the entire state of Nevada, period.  Read the reviews, look at the pretty posted photos...I am not going to be able to add anything further.  Thank you for the AMAZING stay, Cosmo!!
I've stayed at quite a few of the hotels here in Vegas, and wow, this was by far the best. We originally booked 2 adjoining City Rooms but we got both rooms upgrades to the Terrace Studios. Since we flew in on 2 different flights and the name of the person on the room was on the second flight, Cosmo let us switch cards on file while maintaining the price we originally booked (which was a steal compared to other hotels). The lady checking us in automatically asked if we wanted late check, which is at 2pm. We ended up on the 47th floor with a balcony and our view was awesome at night. . . We liked that it was close by to a Walgreens, so we stopped there to pick up drinks, cups and some food for our room. It was a short walk away! . . Went to Marquee one of the nights we were there, so loved that we didn't even have to leave the hotel. Definitely stop by the Secret Pizza place nearby when you're leaving Marquee! . . On the last day, a friend and I decided to check out the pool area even though it wasn't too warm up. I definitely would come back when it's warmer. The pool area looked like it could be a lot of fun. Check out the pics other people have posted on here!. . Also, if you ever go wandering around, there are plenty of photo ops on the many floors!. . The only con I have is their security/lost-and-found. My friend left her jacket in her room so she called security/lost-and-found, told them what it looked like. They said they found it and would hold it for us. Since she had already left on her flight, she gave my name so that I could pick it up for her. When I tried to pick it up, the security guy said there was nothing in lost and found from either rooms and that we would just have to call back tomorrow during the first shift since the second shift guys knew nothing about it. Luckily, when she did call back the next day, they were able to locate her jacket and mailed it back to her. . . I would definitely stay here again provided the price wasn't too high.
By far my favorite hotel in all of Vegas. Being a local, I have seen them all, and this place is perfect for the younger 20-30 crowd. Located right in the middle of the strip, it is so close to so much good nightlife and food places as well. Their ambiance is absolutely beautiful and the staff will tend to your every need. The wrap around suites are breath taking and it really helps if you have a big party to get that suite. I will stay here time after time!
Hands down Best Hotel on The Strip! Can't wait to go back again soon. . Rooms are super comfortable, very Hip Place!
I go to Vegas about 30 times a year for business.  I have stayed at many hotels.  Thought I would go back to Cosmo to earn some Mariott points.  I was very surprised when they wanted to charge me another 6.25 for a refill on my iced coffee and charged 9.50 for the water in the room.  Expensive even for Vegas hotel standards.  When I told an employee who looked like a manager on my way out that I was annoyed that they would not give me a refill on my coffee, he seemed like he could care less.
I gave two stars because the decor is pretty, but it's only on the surface people. I'm not happy At All with my stay. Management needs to get their shit together. The service sucks! It seems staff are not on the same page. First I checked in and had to wait over two hours for my room. Now looking back realized they never confirmed my room type at checkin. I also didn't like the random lines at check in. We had to wait longer than the couple the showed up next to us. Its sort of like a grocery store check out line (luck of the draw). The Bar staff where great at Vesper and the drink menu is fabulous. When we got to our room we found out they had run out of Terrace rooms and give us a city room instead. When I talked to the front desk I was given the run around. My room was never changed and in place of any fair comp they offered a $25 food credit which was not anywhere near the value I should have received. When I complained again they offered a spa day pass when i called to ask about it the spa didn't even have my info and did not allow me to use it. We were also charged for items we shouldn't have been charged for minibar items and Internet. I also found hairs on the floor in our bathroom that were not mine. The shower wasn't cleaned very well. The minibar snacks where all unorganized. Room service didn't provide new glasses and the towels were wrinkly. The remote was sticky and the TV picture quality sucked. Also the one pen on the desk didn't work and the walls looked dirty. the wallpaper behind the tv was coming off the wall and the bathroom walls had marks. My biggest issue was that we did not receive a room with a balcony, bathtub, frig we could use or a microwave. We were told we would have a room with those amenities so we bought food from the store to eat in place of paying high prices for every meal. Well that was a waste. I was really looking forward to taking a bath as I don't have a bath at home and bought bath products for our stay-also a waste. So more than half my time here was horrible. Stay elsewhere and just visit the casino and bars. The pool area is sweet with TVs and foosball.
My favorite thing about the hotel is the location since it's smack dab in the middle of the strip as well as that beautiful lounge with all the draping crystals. I enjoy that the hotel is still fairly new and that it doesn't stink like an ashtray like many older ones do. . . The rooms are nice and modern with an edgy feel. The wall between the shower and the bathroom is glass so you can lift up the curtain and give a peep show. If you don't get a room with a balcony you will at least get a room with a view of the strip and the gorgeous Fountains of Bellagio. . . They house the BEST buffet on the strip - Wicked Spoon. And some other amazing places to eat too.
I don't really like Vegas...but I liked The Cosmopolitan. . . The good: . The lobby is stunning with amazing changing visuals on large pillars.  . Fountain view suites are amazing...views, appointments, etc.. Beds are super comfortable. . Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. . Casino is classy. . Marquee is right in your hotel. . Location can't be beat. . . Unfortunately, The Cosmopolitan is not perfect.... Minimal towels. I expect more than two in a one bedroom suite. . One bathrobe. I'm going to venture a guess that there's usually more than one person staying in a suite. . Our room was not available when we arrived. Apparently, they cannot guarantee your room...ever? We had to stay in a standard room on the first night, then pack up our stuff, bring it down to the bell desk, and wait 4 hours for our originally booked suite to be ready. For a hotel of this level, I'd have expected someone to at least arrange for pick up of our luggage and delivery to a new room. That's said, we were given a food/drink credit that helped the frustration slightly. . Come 4am, the lobby bar is prostitution central. I've been to Vegas plenty of times and seen my fair share of prostitutes but the Cosmo was different.  A swarm of prostitutes and their pimps invaded the lobby bar. It was so in your face that it was uncomfortable. The four pimps actually had a roster/check list to keep track of who was taken and who wasn't. I'd expect this type of thing to be a little lower key than what we saw...t just seemed super classless.  I mean, a hooker checklist? Come on. . . All that said, I still rank the Cosmo in at 4 stars, relative to other options on the strip.  They could use a few improvements but overall, worth the money.
Was really disappointed when I got here seems like this hotels all hype nothing special average hotel nothing crazy expected way more also rooms were supper small
"I Love this hotel!" The ringing quote from our traveling gypsy and blogger Miss Jewel Alexandra.  Feature model for Coastal Beauties this babe shared her journey's with Jewel with us for an inside share on her stay at The Cosmo!. . The suite's are absolutely amazing!  Great layout, 2 bed rooms, 2 1/2 baths, living room and beautiful views.  This hotel is an event in itself, inside the amazing decor and amenities are to die for.  Check out their pool, bar and hot tub or dine at one of their fantastic restaurants.  Inside the hotel is beautifully bedazzled, jeweled and decorated.  You will get lost in the extremely hypnotizing and comfortable decor!. . Jewel recommends Holstein's for Brunch, they have the most amazing Bloody Mary's!  If the bloody mary's don't kick your hangover their milkshakes sure will.  They have both alcohol and alcohol free milk shakes!  Try their Ahi, Wings and Fried Pickles for a delicious sampler of appetizers.  Their burgers are amazing, large and definitely worth saving room for!. . If you get the chance to dine at The Cosmo, be sure to check out STK!  According to our Coastal Beauties Babe Jewel- It is the best dinner she has ever had!  Be sure to try the Tuna Tar Tar or Shell Fish Platter appetizers.  The braised short rib was the best entree of the evening, be sure to pair with your favorite red wine this dish was perfectly prepared and cooked to melt off the bone and in your mouth!. . Coastal Beauties and Jewel Vote 5 Stars definitely would stay here again and definitely gets the official Coastal Beauties seal..."I love this hotel!"
I love this hotel and had a great time at Marquee! I enjoyed the bungalow, but the corkage fee for bringing in your own alcohol is stupid and there's no need for a butler.
This is was one of my favorite Vegas hotels so far.  We stayed here for a girls weekend and all seemed to be pleased with our selection.  The lobby and hotel bars/restuarants were really swanky and cool.  A lot like some of the boutique hotels you find in larger cities.  I loved the alternating images that appeared on the pillars in the lobby near check in counters.  . . Check in was really easy and although there appeared to be a long line, it moved really quickly. . . There are so many great places to eat in this hotel, which was nice because we could do lunch/dinner in our hotel before heading out on the town.  The Henry was our favorite spot to eat.  We actually ate here twice in a 24 hour period!  Says a lot. . . The rooms are really spacious and decorated beautifully.  Loved the gorgeous and unique wallpaper in the rooms and in common areas. . . Our bathroom in our room was huge and was perfect for girls sharing a space.  Great body products also provided by Bigelow.  Lavender & peppermint!! Yes!!. . The only thing I found odd was there was no drawers for storing clothes you'd want to unpack.  Plenty of storage for dishes and food but none for clothes.  Hmph! A bit inconvenient but not a deal breaker if there was a good deal.  . . I'd definitely stay again and just plan to hang most of everything I guess.
"JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WRONG" . . My anticipation to stay at this hotel was off the richter scale. I made a reservation for my 25th birthday knowing that it was not going to disappoint. . . Driving into the structure you leave the old Las Vegas behind and enter an extremely high class futuristic modern take on the new transformation of the strip. Huge silver metallic letters spelling out COSMOPOLITAN adorn the wall as you enter the valet/drop off. The lobby is a sight to see in itself with huge pillars displaying screens of moving art and fashion. The check in process was a breeze and met with great customer service and smiles. They seemed to truly make sure my birthday was going to be met with satisfaction. He saw that I had previously booked a wraparound balcony suite yet cancelled since I had a smaller group going. I told him I still wanted an amazing view though. He said "let me see what I can do" and left. He then came back and told us we could have a wraparound for 100 more a night. We immediately took him up on that. The room was huge and the balcony, being on the 65th floor, made our jaws drop... and not retract till check out. Large living room, huge full kitchen, oversized master bath and also a guest bathroom. The bed was out of this world and made me sleep in both mornings. . . The food options here are great. HOLSTEINS was a new take on a burger restaurant with quirky names and ingredient combinations. I had a salmon burger since I'm pescatarian. The burger was "ok" yet I have had much better. I guess that's what I get for eating at a burger themed restaurant when I don't eat red meat. Both my other friends did enjoy their meals though. Before heading to MARQUEE we grabbed a bite from Secret Pizza which is hiding down an unmarked long hallway. The pizza joint looks very new york with no frills and a simple menu. Honestly, some of the best pizza I have ever had. . . MARQUEE was one of the best clubs I have ever been to, with multi levels and different themed rooms playing different types of music. The main room was a full on party with fog blowing out so much at moments my vision would go white, and the pink and purple metallic confetti raining over the audience. . . This hotel has remained my favorite yet and I can't wait to go back and stay.
Everything was beautiful. Had a few minor issues checking in and when we got to the pent house suite the stereo system wasn't set up and it took them over a half hour to work on it and didn't end up fixing it. If I'm paying over a grand a night I expect perfection. The butlers were all amazing and very helpful! Jenny in the butlers office was wonderful! Carrie who is the manager of setting up pent house suites was very difficult to communicate with and usually Unreachable.
Booked a room with balcony..when we arrived there were no balcony rooms left. Put us in a regular room. We were given a credit. Moved us the next day to a balcony suite..which is kind of a hassle to pack up & move. After staying 1st night in suite we left to a meeting & when we returned in evening..room was not cleaned. Manager credited my spa charge at checkout. I found it unusual too when you call spa, room service, front desk..phone rings & rings before someone picks up. The balcony is super neat but in my opinion, the place is too pricey for what you get.
+500 points for the inspired genius of Chandelier, a 3-4 story crystal-draped bar which forms the centerpiece of the main casino complex.  Unprecedented masterpiece of extravagant design in the same league as classic Las Vegas magnificence like the original Stardust neon sign (which, in one of its later forms was salvaged from the demolition, and still exists somewhere in the Neon Museum). You would think the vast sparkling draperies must be plastic, for weight and safety reasons. But touch them--they're solid glass.. . +300 points for GREEN FELT gaming tables - only Paris, Cosmo, and Caesar's have them as far as I know--everywhere else they're beige, brown, purple, maroon... ugh.. . -200 points for the pervasive, inescapable stench of cigarette and cigar smoke and the presence, at each crowded table, of at least one heavy smoker.  . . +100 points for soft, padded walls in the halls.
I straight up hate this place. Is that enough of a review? No? Okay well let me tell you why I hate this hotel.. . Arriving at the hotel your hit in the face with the most awful scent ever. My boyfriend described it as "urinal cakes". Yummy.. . Check in went fine, and we headed up to our room. Well we walk in and the room is boiling hot. Turn on the lights and it looked like someone attacked the shower area. The only covering that makes the shower private was sprayed out across the floor. Looked like an angry bear mauled it.. . We called down and they sent someone up about 20 mins later. Mind you it's past midnight at this point, we're hungry and tried. As we waited we noticed the tv wasnt working. Well maintenance fixed that, but said the shower cover curtain thing will be held off till morning. They never came to fix it. . . So good thing I was rooming with the boyfriend otherwise it would have been rather uncomfortable showering with the world to see.. . Our mini fridge and bar food area was half stocked. That's cool..okay thanks? No hangers, except two that said to enjoy their bathrobes. Those didn't exist!. . Before heading to bed we ripped the place apart searching for the 'do not disturb' sign. Well it didn't exist. So we called down and said "hey please don't send room cleaning over-we don't want it". . . Next morning as I'm snoozing away. Some dude parades in and walks all the way to the bed before realizing I'm there. He left right away, but whoa come on!  (Happened three mornings in a row after calling them and saying not to send anyone up).. . When we did ask for the room cleaning they never restocked our toilet paper (there was also none when we arrived)...thanks! Also we were charged $76 for the room cleaning. That's never happened to us in vegas before.. . We called down again to have the mini fridge cleared out (not that there was much anyway). Well the lady came she grabbed everything then stocked our stuff carefully above the sensors. LOL! . . During check out low and behold we were charged for everything the woman took out of the bar. They took it off but what a hassle that was. . . Btw the restaurants suck here. We tried three and they all sucked. . . Guys and gals.. Don't stay here. Go to the encore.
My favorite place to stay in Vegas.  Rooms are suites with large lanais and great views.  Easy walk to my second favorite hotel
I had great experiences at the cosmopolitan hotel in the past but this time it left me thinking if I should ever return. . . Day 1 - check in. There were not many people in line but the front desk person seems to be in a rush. Did not care to explain where I should go to get to my room, did not offer me a hotel map and his tone of voice was somewhat agitated. What if it was my first time at the hotel, that is just bad experience from the start. Not good!. . Day 2 - working in the room. I had adjoining room with another co-worker. We were working and had multiple conference calls. No disturb sign was on my door but not my co-worker's. Housekeeping came by multiple times to my co-worker's room and I had to tell her come back later. Each time she insist to clean my room too. But I didn't need it and I told her so. The room was pretty neat and tidy, plus I just did not want my room cleaned. She was pushy and kept insisting on cleaning at least the bathroom. Drove me a little crazy. . . Day 2 - beeping noise in the room . It started after I opened the mini bar. There was a beeping sound that sounded like the smoke detector battery is low. Call the front desk told them about it and they say they will send someone. After an hr no one showed up and I had to leave the room to attend a meeting and dinner. When I got into the room at midnight, I heard the beeping sound again this time more frequent intervals. Called the front desk, told them what happened and the person said I never heard about such feedback before not sure what it is. But if it beeps again call us again. The beeps came every so often and by the time I dial for front desk the beeping sound goes away. So the entire night I got woken up by the beeping sound.. . When I checked out this morning I wonder to myself if I book my stay in November at cosmopolitan
I was so excited to finally stay at the Cosmo. It's such a beautiful hotel & it's in a great location. We were here for Presidents' Day weekend & Valentines, so it was just my boyfriend and I. We had booked outside of Cosmo and the woman who helped me advised that we ask if there were any rooms available with just 1 king bed.. . CHECKING IN: After some confusion with which line do we stand in, we checked in :) The woman was kind & checked to see if there were rooms available with just 1 bed, for an additional $50/night we were able to upgrade to a terrace studio. After a brief discussion, we declined since we weren't going to be in the room that much anyways. Something to be aware of -- since I booked with an outside company, (which I think a handful of consumers do to get the better rate), i was informed that the resort fee would be covered with the credit card HOLD upon check in. I even clarified this with the woman checking us in, she said yes - it is covered. This does not carry over during the remainder of our trip.. . ROOM: We get up to our room, it's a city view room. But, we were facing the building and looking down at the tennis courts. Although we had declined the offer for an upgrade, we were going to be in Vegas for 4 days, we wanted to get our moneys worth. I called the room coordinator and requested another room & we got a courtesy upgrade! I wish I could remember the woman who helped me, she was so sweet! We didn't have to go back downstairs, she just told us what room to go to from where we were. Our room was amazing! We were upgraded to a terrace studio with an insane view of the bellagio fountains. It was so beautiful! The terrace studio was an incredible upgrade, we were so happy we called just to request a room switch. It had a living room, kitchenette, japanese soaking tub, and a larger shower. The view alone is worth it! The bed was comfy, i like fluffy pillows!. . GYM: Boyfriend and I were super excited to check out the gym. We were in the west tower, so we were informed that's where the larger gym is. When we arrived, we were told that we had opted out of the resort fee & had to pay $20/pp to use the gym. The woman who was working the front desk was kind & explained to us that there must have been a miscommunication and that it would be waived. We still had to $40 though to use the gym! Ridiculous. The gym itself was beautiful. All new machines and some state of the art stuff, including a boxing ring! . . FOOD: The restaurant selection was interesting - what was difficult was in the midst of walking around & wanting something quick, that didn't exist at this hotel. & it seemed as if there was always a line at the restaurants. The choice of restaurants are all impressive & I would have loved to try some of them. Hopefully next time! The concierge desk was very helpful in assisting with booking our valentines dinner. We originally had dinner booked at Encore, but the traffic on the strip was ridiculous bc of special events & we didn't want to leave our side of the strip. Since STK was fully booked, he recommended we try out SHe at Crystals and it was TO DIE! Wicked Spoon is the buffet here --- my favorite buffet on the strip, hands down. =). . CLUB/Entertainment: Marquee is housed at Cosmo. We went to the first winter pool party & it was SO FUN! The new dome set up is pretty remarkable. If you're a guest at the hotel, you just give them your key and you have free entry. Ta da! Bruno Mars was at Cosmo the same weekend performing at the Chelsea, so we were able to see him at the After Party at Marquee. Rose.Rabbit.Lie is a new social experiment/club/show.. it was pretty awesome. If you're in the mood for something different and are with a group of people, I'd definitely recommend coming down to Rose Rabbit Lie at Cosmo!. . HIDDEN Fees: We went downstairs after our work on the first day to figure everything out. The front desk tried to argue with me in saying that we had opted out of paying the resort fee. I explained to them that this was incorrect & that this needed to be corrected. They understood and assured me that the $40 would be credited back to us and we would be charged the hold fees as promised. Upon check out, we noticed the fees & approved them all. When we got back home we checked the damage & did notice that were a few charges we didn't see when we left.  I had to call the accounting office at Cosmo to have it all figured out & she event stated to me, "I'm not sure why you were charged that. Are you sure it's from Cosmopolitan Las Vegas?" I was so confused. After about 15 minutes of assuring her that the bank statement stated Cosmo we were able to figure it out & we were given credit back to our account. Had I had not called - we would have paid for fees we weren't responsible for. . . Overall - a beautiful room with a beautiful view, beautiful hotel. Some disappointment with the overall experience considering we had to speak to staff regarding all these fees popping up everywhere.
