Watch out for all the new rules for blackjack in Vegas. Different rules at gaming tables than players used to have. Some tables don't let you double down,some won't let you split at certain times, and on and on. Or pay double if you want to split again.the odds are definitely favoring the house. "Real" blackjack players will not be happy at these tables. At Caesars alone, we visited 3 blackjack tables with different rules at each table. I guess Vegas is going to win no matter what. Guess it's time for a new city to gamble in.  Had tickets for shania twain but she cancelled the day before. They refunded our money. I did want to see her. Bummer. Vegas weather was nice, 60s for February. But it's really dry here so drink plenty of water and bring lotion for your skin.
I really enjoyed my stay.  I was treated to friendly and supportive staff from the initial registration attendant, to the staff in the athletics room, and even in the casino.  The hotel was very clean and beautiful, and the food at the restaurants was excellent.  But I was blown away by the support of the Lost & Found and Security Departments who were able to recover the watch I left in the room and discovered missing in the airport.  I am glad to say that I am wearing my watch, as I type this email only a few days later.  Thank you Caesars Palace, I look forward to my next stay.
I love staying here, the new towers are gorgeous.   The rooms are super spacious and I love the view of the belagio fountains.   The bathrooms are huge the jacuzzi bath tub is glorious.   The Starbucks off the elevator is why convenient.   The pool is super clean and always a fun time. The shopping is AMAZING!!  all of my favorite shops!!!
REVIEW for 'Pure Nightclub' . GOOD:. AMAZING DJ . Beautiful venue. Cool interior design. . BAD: . Only 2 bartenders working with 50 people waiting at a time. I waited 30 minutes and then had to ASK the bartender if I could be served. . NO SEATING UNLESS YOU BUY BOTTLE SERVICE!. Bouncers inside only watch people when they sit down & force them to stand up if they sit down, rather than watching and keeping the girls SAFE. . Bouncers were VERY rude. . Everyone is a little... TOO friendly on the dance floor. . OVERWHELMING amounts of men. There was almost a LINE of men to dance with me and my friend and we had to constantly (meaning every 5 seconds) decline their abrupt dancing actions.. Dance floor for anyone who didn't buy bottle service painfully packed and SMALL. .  NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!
Would not recommend this hotel. The facilities are less than expected given the price and the service is poor.  We booked 5 rooms, one of the rooms had a broken heater and no hot water; if I had stayed in that room, this would be a one-star review.. . I've heard that quality of the facilities vary greatly between the different towers; we stayed in the Roman Tower.
Always extravagant. Always a pleasure. I love the ambiance at this casino/hotel. It's a must visit every time I go to Vegas.. The Atlantis Forum is a nice, short show to watch as you grab a drink to begin your evening. . The shopping is fantastic to satisfy the shopaholic's desires. And the casino area is over The top with high ceilings and countless slot machines to black jack tables.. A must visit spot
I was really surprised to find how basic this hotel was for how expensive the rooms usually go for. Had I not gotten a last-minute deal off HotelTonight, then I would have been really disappointed at the quality of the rooms at Caesars Palace, given the hotel's reputation. . . The room was really basic--I would compare it to your standard Hampton Inn off the highway in any-town USA in terms of room colors, decoration, and ambiance. . . The downstairs has some really high-end shopping and a HUGE club-like H&M, which is nice if you won big and are looking to spend some cash. . . While the casino and shopping are some of the best, the rooms are on the just "ok" end of the spectrum. I would forgo staying here and just pop in to eat, gamble, or shop.
The downstairs bathroom is incredibly nice!. Outside, is a shoe shining booth and a couch. . . When you walk in, there's a triptych along the winding entrance.. Venus d' Milo and Statue of David photos on the bathroom stalls.. There's a powder room adjacent to the sinks.. . I always make this my before or after stop on my way to Bacchanal
Walked straight through and ate at Mesa Grill. I'm now a huge fan. Not a meal I can afford every night, but when it is that special night this is a great option
We went to Caesar's to see Celine Dion on our second night in LV and dined in Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. . . Our experience was excellent and Caesar's is a beautiful Casino and complex. Dining outside' the restaurant, we felt like we were outside because it's so.... Wow. That's the only word I can really think of now.. . Love that you don't get harassed by salespeople everywhere you walk like you do in some other hotels.
Wow! This place has everything: great shops that are hard to find anywhere else, awesome restaurants, and its a great concert venue! We saw Shania Twain here...super cool! I wanted to eat at bobby flay's mesa grill...maybe tonight:-)
I enjoy going to Caesars Palace.  Although, it is one of the Strip properties that we have yet to stay in Las Vegas.  So, why am I a fan?  During my gambling days, the casino has been good to me.  Hey, any casino that I leave with more money than I came in with....I am going to be a fan of that place.  Since I've married, my serious gambling days are behind me.  Nowadays, my budget is $20 for gambling.. . What else I like about Caesars Palace:. . 1.  The atmosphere and decorations are cool.. 2.  The casino ventilation is much better than most other Vegas hotels.. 3.  Celine Dion was amazing!. 4.  Great place to people watch.. 5.  They have Cheesecake Factory!!. 6.  Browsing the Forum Shops.. 7.  Centrally located on the Strip.. . What i do not like about Caesars Palace:. . 1.  Actually, everything is fine.  No real complaints from me.  Sure, it's kind of pricey...but they are not overly priced on their hotel rates.. . I do not know if we will ever spend the night here.  I do know that we will continue to come here in the future because of all the reasons listed above plus others not mentioned.
"You probably get this a lot, this isn't the real Caesar's Palace is it? Did, umm... did Caesar live here? I didn't think so." It's ok that the real Caesar didn't live here, at least the place is pager friendly! . . I've always had a pleasant experience staying at Caesar's; although, I can't say the same about losing money while gambling here. You can't miss this massive property right off the Flamingo exit of the I-15.. . Somehow, I always end up in the Palace Tower room. That's the room with the exhibitionist shower in between the two bathrooms. You'd think having two bathrooms is convenient until one person is taking a shower but has to lock both doors since the shower doors are glass. If you don't care, shower away and display what yo mama gave you. The dual showerheads make it fun to shower with a friend while doing the earth a favor by conserving water.. . The furniture is modern and the rooms are upkept nicely. The beds are comfy I have no complaints. My last trip was with three guys and of course they forgot to pack some toiletries. They had someone bring up toothbrushes, shaving cream and razors, extra shampoo and conditioner, and soap. They even brought up extra robes and slippers.. . We pulled an all nighter and I finally got to bed around 10am. We were all feeling lazy later on and they brought back dinner from the food court. Their food court actually has good food unlike food courts from other hotels.. . Some may say overrated or not worth the price, but everyone should try the Bacchanal Buffet at least once!
One star for the forum shops. I like to look in the windows of the Louboutin and Agent Provocateur boutiques and drool. I never actually go into the shops of course, because it would be embarassing. First of all, I'm usually wearing something that came off the clearance rack at Charlotte Russe. I'll only set foot inside when I can afford $1000 shoes and a $100 pair of panties. If I only had a sugar daddy. Or a salary. Or hell, both. Anyway.... . Oh sweet mother of God. This hotel rivals Circus Circus as one of my least favorite hotels I've stayed in EVER.. Let us begin.. . *If you self park, you will walk forever to get anywhere. They have some kind of drainage or sewage problem, so when you enter you will get a wiff of that. . . *Front desk is soooo damn rude for no reason, and if you want to upgrade rooms they are just "not available" ever. If you want an early check in, pay 50 bucks. The resort fee is 30 bucks. It's a rip.. . *Avoid avoid, and let me just emphasize AVOID the "Roman" tower like the god damn plague. It appears the rooms have not been cleaned or remodeled since this place opened. I would say the room I stayed in in the Roman tower was borderline unacceptable. It made Motel 8 look like the friggin Mariott.. . *The whole entire hotel and casino is dated. I'm all for themed hotels, and I embrace the tacky in most situations in life, but this place is just drab and depressing. The casino has minimum blackjack set at $25. Yeah okay, no.. . *Anywhere you eat here will be expensive and will taste like shit. Just trust me on this.. . *The pool area. Okay, it's cool, I like the different "pools," it's a fun concept. I liked the casino game tables that were in the water too. But like everything else on this hotel property, maintainence is needed. Also, they do not monitor who goes in and out of the pool area. Lots of creepers creepin. Anyone can come in whether they are staying at the hotel or not. Not kidding, I saw a dirty homeless man chilling. What the hell?? Speakin of creepin, I peeked at the seperate "topless" pool area that you gotta pay to get into. What I saw were a bunch of men sitting around and a couple of women, none of which were rockin out with their tits out. . I want to add that I saw many people walking through the pool area in wedding type attire. I think you might have to go through there to get to the chappel or something, which to me, is real freakin weird. I could be wrong, but that's what it looked like. . . I'll admit, from the outside I like how Caesers Palace looks. The statues they have outside the hotel and the fountains look cool, I like them. But, that's all you need to see. At some point in it's prime, probably in the 70's or something, high rollers used to hang out here. Just keep that image with you in your mind and drive on past. This place is not a 5 star hotel, it's far far from it. It's not worth the $$$ to stay on this piece of shit property with all the places you can stay in Vegas.
The casino was smokier than I expected for Caesars Palace. Seriously, I had to leave after 15 minutes, you would have thought we were at Gold Nugget. My eyes turned red. Seemed a little cramped on the casino floor.  A show got out and the flood of people took all the breathing room out of the walkway.
Thank Caesar's ghost we had reward club passes for a free two night stay because I would've been LIVID if we had paid their exorbitant $729 per room per night for a room! Sure, our room looked nice, but I wasn't pleased to see how filthy everything was and didn't like the feeling I might get charged to touch something. I didn't expect to see dirty doors, walls, ripped fabrics, damaged walls and torn lampshades, and the finding the previous occupants socks under the bed was a surprise, too. Add these things to the ridiculously overpriced in-room snacks and minibar items (seriously, they provide a Kuerig to use, but can't spare a couple of complimentary K-cups and some sugar?!?) found the place way too big to navigate and don't even get me started on how rude the registration staff was (his name is Amoud, I'd avoid him, he seems cranky) I was perturbed to learn at check in they require a $200 deposit for our stay, information that was not relayedduring my call to make reservations. Then we have the "resort fee" of $28 per night, which did include one free day of wifi for one device (to use other devices would be yet another charge at $14.99 per device per day) and I found to be super slow. Overall, 2 stars for the very grand appearance of the place, the deep spa tub & location, but other than that, I won't be back. Even with the complimentary stay,  there is no such thing as "free."
Was looking to stay at Caesar's for a while. Got a room in the Augustus Tower, paid $315.00 for 2 nights.. I expected more for the price, the furniture was ok, nothing modern. The tv was small. Don't touch any food items on the counter or fridge or you will be charged for it.. The bathroom is great, jacuzzi tub, used it both days. There was a tv in the bathroom which was pretty nice..  Great view of the strip.. Complementary slippers, chocolate and water in the evenings.. The location is great, close to everything.
Took another trip to Vegas and time was able to check off Caesars Palace off my wish list. My other visits to Vegas I had stayed at some of the less fancy hotels on the strip so this place is in a whole other league. Don't get me strong I still like the less fancy hotels and have no problem with them at all but I am saying the atmosphere is way different. Everything at Caesars is much more expensive so if you eat at the restaurants there the entire time prepare to spend a pretty penny on food. That pretty much goes for buying anything there. The mini bar in my room wanted $12.00 for plain M&Ms, lol. Just a fair warning. Ok now time for the details. . . Check in was a breeze. My cab driver dropped me off at the VIP entrance because it was quicker and easier to get to and he was very cool like that. I was not sure where to go from there to check in so I went to the VIP desk there and they went ahead and checked me in instead of sending me to the main desk in the front. It was a very quick and painless check in which I can always appreciate. The lady at the front desk was very polite and she called a bellhop right away to take my bags up to my room. My room was in the Forum Tower room 6504. It was quite a ways from the desk where I checked in. Instead of sending me of into the unknown to get lost the bellhop David very kindly walked me and my bag to my room. He was very sweet the entire time and he have me a tour of the place as we walked to my room. That ended up being very helpful because I didn't get lost once after that. Once we got into my room he set up my luggage for me and then as he was explaining where the ice machine was he offered to go get me some ice if I wanted some. I thought that was great. He showed me the room and some of the frills associated with it. He went above and beyond in my opinion and made me feel very welcome. . . Ah the room, here's the fun part. That room was bad ass. I have no other way of putting it. The bed was so comfortable!!! The room also had those comfy robes so you can guess what I wore when I hung around the room, lol. There was a TV in the bathroom mirror. That was the craziest thing I ever seen. Everything is digital now so it is very modern. The drapes and the "do not disturb sign" all worked by pushing a button rather than manually. The room had three phones in it. One next to the toilet even which I thought was funny. The shower was heavenly. It had an ordinary shower head alone with a larger one in the middle of the shower. The size of the shower was also great, very spacious and plenty of room to shower comfortably. The bathroom is also very large and has an excellent vanity area and the keep plenty of towels available. The size of the entire room in general was great. Very spacious. I also had a great view of the strip which is always nice. I was impressed with the room overall that's for sure. . . OK, I was feeling pretty tired the night I arrived and I did not feel like hunting for a place to eat so I decided to splurge a little and order room service. Fair warning and this doesn't count against them but the room service menu is very expensive and overall it is not worth it. The prices are clearly marked and I still decided to pay the extra amount for the convenience so that's my own fault. Just a fair warning that it isn't worth it really. Their customer service is stellar though. When I called the man who answered the phone was very helpful and he answered my questions about the menu and helped me come to a decision. They told me the delivery time would be about 40 minutes but they arrived much quicker than that. The person who brought me was food was very nice and polite and she set me up nicely. . . The casino was great. I actually had a lot of fun here. The table minimums here are higher than some of the other neighboring casinos but after a while I didn't even really notice. The dealers that I encountered were very fun to play with and I killed at the blackjack tables so that made me happy. . . Check out was a breeze and I hope more hotels are using this method. The sent me an email the morning of my departure asking me to schedule my checkout time so essentially I checked out via email so no lines. You can also checkout through your TV in your room as well. Very painless which is great if you have a flight to catch or something else planned. I just turned in my keys at the front desk and that was it. . . The last service I used was the bell desk for my bags. My flight did not leave until later in the afternoon so I had some time before I had to be at the airport so instead of lugging my suitcase everywhere I checked it in at the bell desk. They were excellent too. They quickly took my info and my bag and let me be on my way. When I came to pick up the bag same thing, I handed them the tag they gave me and they quickly retraived my bag and got me in a cab to the sirport.
