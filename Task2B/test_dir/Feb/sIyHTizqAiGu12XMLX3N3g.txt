AMAZING!!!! this and wicked spoon are the most amazing buffets in vegas. . . with fresh oysters, sushi, desserts, and anything else you can imagine you can't go wrong. . . Now the 49 dollar charge isn't too cheap but its worth it for Vegas. GO HUNGRY ;). . you wil not be disappointed, located in caesars palace, its in a great location
Felt like I was in a dystopian sci if movie, filling me with fear and dread for the human race, which is precisely what I wanted out of a Las Vegas buffet.
Forget any buffet you've everbeen to, it doesn't matter what you may think you know. This is thee best buffet EVER. 5 star buffet, from lobster clam chowder to macaroni n cheese to die for. If there was ever evidence for a god, this would be it.
I love this buffet so much that I ended up showing up 15 min b4 it closed just to each as much as I can because its that good . This is the buffet I look forward to the most in vegas as everthing is spiced and seasoned with so much flavor...hold on I have to pause my yelping to eat some more... im back.. I was able to eat around the world by sampling all the foods they have here. Italian , seafood, asian , american , mexican n more. I enjoyed the lobster bisque, lamb chops, duck, and sweet n sour shrimp, its all so good I have to cut this yelp short I ate too much I have to go and take a poo..
THIS BUFFET IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!. . Although there might be an hour and a half wait in line just to get in, it's totally worth it. The OYSTERS and orange juice is the best part. I can't really say anything about the meat but the people at my table loved it. They have this ginseng soup that is pretty amazing as well. I don't see any cons to this place other than the wait to get into the buffet. Although the price might be alittle "expensive" it's totally worth every penny. . . This place is truly amazing.
Prob the best buffet I've ever been to.   Yes, it's $63 dollars a person but where are you gonna get high quality buffet food?  I didn't have 85% of the offerings cuz I'm not a big eater BUT I was left stuffed full of tasty Hot BUTTERED crab legs.  Dessert offerings were also wonderful. Staff is super!
Just Wow (once you get through the misearble long line that is).  So many decadent options ... definitely possible to eat your money's worth ... unless you're allergic to seafood (which I, happily, am not!).. . There are different stations organized by cuisine.  I ended up trying most things from each (and obviously some things more than others).  Not to brag, but my buffet prowess, though having faded a bit with age, is still pretty impressive, so much so that the people at the next table asked me at one point how it was possible I could still keep eating.  . . A few tips:  . . ~  DON'T start with the American station - that'll fill you up too quickly with all the fried, BBQ and starch (read: hot dog buns are NOT your friend).  Save tasting these for the end.  . . ~  Also try to go light on the dim sum and noodles at the Asian station and pastas/pizzas at Italian (though I'll admit I love Italian and the station was right next to our table, so I did break my own rule on that one - the truffled polenta and veal lasagne were delicious!!).  . . ~  The best bang for your buck is obviously the seafood stations - the crab legs, oysters, mussles and various ceviches are all super fresh and unlimited for your taking (and take I did!).  . . ~  The dessert station was a masterpiece of shapes, texture and colors, but only a couple of the options really stood out taste-wise.. . Despite this being a buffet, the atmosphere was quite classy and the decor ultra sleek and modern.  I thought the price was very reasonable (I think it was only $90 for 2, plus tip), especially considering bottomless champagne and mimosas are included in the tab.. . All in all, way better than the Bellagio buffet, which I enjoyed but is glaringly out-dated and out-classed compared to Bacchanal.  (I've yet to try Wicked Spoon)
We came again for their brunch buffet with bottomless mimosas. It was heavenly.. . I especially loved the plentiful portion of warmed crab legs they gave me. And the pork buns were exquisite as always. . . The macaroni and cheese was rich and succulent. . . The desserts were to die for - so much to choose from and none of what I tried was against my tastebuds.. . Great experience.
The night before - "Wear your tight dresses tonight because BUFFET TOMORROW!!". The day of - "SO EXCITED FOR BUFFET!". Four hours into it - "How are we going to fit into our dresses tonight....". . AMAZING. Seriously. Bacchanal Buffet is the best buffet I've ever had. . . If you go in during direct lunch/dinner hours, the wait can be gruesome. However, I'll let you in on some cooooool thangs!. Cool thing #1: They have a system where you can wait-list yourself and it will send you a text to let you know when you can be seated. You don't have to wait there! Go grab a Fat Tuesday and walk around (burn off some calories before you eat more heh). . Cool thing #2: You can actually pay an extra $15 to get in right away, just ask the hostess to direct you to the "express line". . Cool thing #3: If you go in during lunch hours, you can stay until dinner hour hits (at 3pm)! It's cheaper and you get the best of both worlds! This is the reason we stayed at the buffet for four hours.... . They have a HUGE variety of food and there was not one thing I tried that I didn't like. Not only is their food good, but their dessert is also delicious!! Even though I was really full, I couldn't help loading up my plate with different desserts. I was actually quite impressed with their macarons, not too shabby for a place that doesn't specialize in macarons. . . If I haven't convinced you yet to try Bacchanal, I know the one thing that will!. . BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS.. . . (9/100 in 2014)
Best buffet I had in years! This is one of the best buffets I had in a long time. It's right next to Bellagio and Wynn standards. Great job in transforming into a high end buffet. Btw a lil tip if you wanna get seated quick and avoid the extremely long line then I suggest you pay the extra $15 and get the 24hour pass. So worth it.
The 6 1/2 hour wait for the golden ticket into this place is a little intimidating, but go in and sign up at their kiosk  then head out on the strip for some fun and come back.  . I think that I ate like $25 worth of macaroons ( the green pistachio flavor is heaven), so that helped make up for the fact that some of the fun specialty items that I was looking forward to trying (watermelon salad and King crab legs etc.) but were not available. Some of the dishes were over the top awesome!  There was a creamy baked polenta with mushrooms and truffle oil that was to die for and the desert area is absolutely amazing!
Up to this point, i've visited almost every major Vegas buffet, and if I had to choose my top 2 Bacchanal would be up in there. This is what I call a TRUELY AMAZING buffet for a variety of reasons:. . The Food - The flavors are fantastic for every dish that is presented. They are given an unusual amount of care for even a vegas buffet, giving focus on depth of flavor and presentation. The variety is what you would expect from a super buffet, with one very surprising and very appreciated exception: It is a rotating/evolving buffet. . . What does that mean?. . Traditionally, dishes for breakfast/lunch/dinner are set during the time period. At Bacchanal, they bring in new dishes every 30 or 45 minutes in certain areas of the buffet to mix it up a bit. It's a very refreshing take and makes for a fun experience.. . The knock: Service. It's a bit lacking and it took me a long time to get my drinks, as well as refill them. I would have liked them to be more attentive.. . Overall, really good buffet and worth the price of admission.

Not sure how to rate a nice place and balance it with the fact that 4 out of 6 of our party got food poisoning. If they can eliminate the food poisoning part of the equation I would give it 4.5-5 starts.. . Anyways we had a party of 6 do a late lunch/early dinner on Sunday 2/1 at Bacchanal. It's by far the nicest buffet place in Vegas...except for the food borne illness potential. It wasn't the crab or seafood counters...so had to be either the meats, sushi, or desserts counters. The doctor in our group noticed symptoms for himself by 10pm Sunday and warned the rest of the group. By midnight I had symptoms. By next morning two others in our group were also sick with the same gastrointestinal issues.. . Would I go back if they eliminated the food borne pathogens? Yes. Could they though based upon volume and quantity? Probably not.
I really liked their prime rib and mashed potatoes.  I don't know the name but it was this one type of meat with the bone attached (probably rib meat?).  Also very good.. . I also likes the ox tail soup.  they had a variety of desserts but I love flan and theirs was good.
Great food! Nice atmosphere! Good service. Deeliiiicioussssss desserts. No complaints. Will definitely comeback the next time I come to Vegas.
food was awesome.if you go at the right time no waiting in line. alot of selections!!! and their desserts....Mmmmmmm!!!
If this is what heaven is like then I'm going to try my hardest to get there.  The crab legs and oysters were so fresh. I think I had 5 full plates by myself. The dessert bar was beyond amazing (i'm not much of a dessert person either). I don't think I even ate half the stuff there.  Can't wait to come back to try the half.
Absolutely superb.. . 7 Restaurants for the price of one really. When you think about that and how long you can sit around eating top quality food, the price is actually pretty reasonable. $50/person for a dinner may seem like a lot, but i'm more than willing to pay it to eat at Bacchanal. Similarly there will be a line a mile long to eat at the buffet, but the line moves and it is so well worth the wait. . . There's something for everyone, from fish and shellfish to steaks and meat loaf. From sushi to pasta to tacos. The food's delicious and you'll want to keep going back for more. My favorites included the rigatoni with sausage, some of the Asian dishes, and the carne asada tacos. . . But for me, the highlight, the cherry on top, is the dessert station. Those warm cookies are heavenly. And then to add a bit of ice cream on top.....perfection.. . Bacchanal is the one buffet worth going to. GO AND ENJOY!!
This place is an experience. We walked up on Super Bowl Sunday and hot brunch. It is about $55 a person with tip. . . If you judged each individual item, about half would be below a B-  that being said, the compilation of items as a whole is more like an A-  . . Desert bar was very impressive. . . The defining characteristic of this place is the shear mass of food and it was good. Oh yea, Mimosa's included in price. . . It was well worth a visit. I would not do it often though. I spent 2 hours and 15 minutes eating like a glutton.
We went to the Bacchanal Buffet yesterday to celebrate my Birthday.  We have eaten thee about 6 times last year (June thru October 2013) and after getting shut out (3-4 hour waits which we would not do), my friends and my wife were very anxious to have a great buffet experience again.. . Wow, what a disappointment!  It felt like a new manager was aboard and decided to cut back on a lot of things too save money!  The lamb chops which have always been delicious and melt-in-your-mouth-tender were tough, very tough!  I usually eat 7 or 8 ribs, but yesterday I couldn't eat two and most of it I left on my plate.  The hot crab-legs were tasteless as if they had been soaking in the pot of water for days.  The corn on the cob, which is usually sweet and crispy, was tough and tasteless!  I could not get a rare piece of prime rib.  A reddish piece of prime rib does not mean it is rare!. . Since it was Chinese New Year's, the Asian offerings were tremendous.  The roast duck was its usual good and tasty.  The dim sum area was increased and good although I think the skin they use to wrap the dim sum was too thick and gooey.  The other offerings (garlic crab legs, pig's feet, etc.) were excellent.  I also had a bowl of Ramen tonkotsu noodle soup made up for me and it was very, very good.  I had 4 helpings of their miso marinated steamed seabass, which was delicious!. . Of course, since the buffet is the largest buffet in all of Las Vegas, there were enough other things to eat that were delicious that we all ended up stuffed.  BUT our favorites were disappointing.  I hope our next visit, if we can get up the nerve to try it again, will not be disappointing.
Solid.  Pretty good but not mind blowing. My favorite items were the beet salad (so Californian of me) and the macaroons.  Hey it's a buffet, so I had to get one of each flavor.  Lots of variety like you would get from most buffets in Vegas.  This one has a lot of Asian options, maybe because I was there around Chinese New Year?!  Definitely something for everyone!
Last meal in Vegas at Caesars and it was so good!!! This is about the only thing I will miss this time.  You got my money and won't give it back!  This buffet had everything you can imagine.  From seafood, large shrimp, pastas, great salads, Asian cuisine, Mexican, pizzas, breakfast buffet, tons of desserts, and on and on and on.....Monday thru Friday the price was $25 each, then Saturday and Sunday it went up to $50 each, but all you can drink mimosas and crab legs was added to the menu.
We travel to Vegas a few times a year and are frequent visitors to the buffets at various hotels. We were recommended Bachannal by a friend and had a chance to stop by last time we were in Vegas. . . A bit on the pricey side and the wait can be 2+ hours sometimes, but HANDS DOWN BEST BUFFET I've been to in Vegas. Great selection, quality foods and very clean/well put together inside. We can't wait to go back!
I am not sure why everyone feels that this is a great place for dinning.  Personally, I feel that I can spent my money in a much better place.  After dinning in this place it just confirms my opinion that buffet does not offer quality food. The buffet does offer a very wide variety of food choices and if that's all you look for in food than this is the place for you.  If you seek quality...you will not find it here.  I know thAt one can have spend $50 at a much better place.
Been to many of the buffets at Las Vegas, but this was by far the largest I've ever been too! So many selections and all the food was top of the line. Being from Texas I'm a hard judge on BBQ and this place held it's own! The brisket was smoked and juicy and the short ribs were to die for! Word of advice get small portions so you can try a little bit of everything, they have fresh made to order street tacos that were incredible! Overall wonderful experience and upscale environment. It's a must do when coming to Vegas!
SO I've been the place where everyone says to go..Bacchanal Buffet. I heard crazy stories of the wait and the food..but impressively enough, there was no wait for Saturday during lunch time. Super nice!. . I was impressive by the size and decor of the place. very cute and simple lines which i loved. They had a whole bunch of neat presentations and little finger hot plate grabbers. (use them..plates are HOT). . . The american food there was a-ok in yelp terms. The fries were superrrrr salty, even for my husband, king of salt. the eggs, the benedict, and burger was all what you would expect..nothing too delicious stood out. THe carving station is always a good bet when you go to a buffet. . . the crab legs were good. they cut them in half length-wize so it was super easy to eat. We got a ton of those.. . The Italian food was very generic too, the pizzas and breads were good, the pasta was ok. . . The asian food is where it it at. I loved the PHO. it was perfect. If I had known, I would of gone there first, middle, and LAST. the sushi was ok, but i never am too impressed with sushi at a buffet. The Chinese food was pretty good tho. . . Now the glory of the desserts! I think the dinner desserts are better, but the gelato was good. The chocolate was toooooo sweet and decedent for my sweet tooth. . . OVerall I think this place was good, i think people hyped it up too much so I was expecting the food to be way better than it was, but for a buffet, I have to say I would come back here.
Ever since moving to Southern California, we've been frequent visitors of Las Vegas and we've tried many buffets.  If you are ever visiting the Las Vegas Strip and you only have time for 1 buffet, then this is one to go for.  You should definitely go here at least once in your life; it's totally unforgettable and well worth the money that you are spending.  By the way, you can save on the cost if you get the total rewards card.  Not to mention, for all the crab that you can eat, it's well worth the $45/adult!  Ages 3 and under are free, while ages 4-12 cost like $23.  There's also Asian cuisine here, which is actually pretty good.  There's a lot of good meat here; in fact, the meat was so addicting that I got diagnosed with gout shortly after eating here last time.  It's okay; now, I eat meat again.
Ok, the early hype about greatest buffet ever was probably a bit more than deserved. Overall food was good, but I would expect that for over $50 per person for dinner. Asian food was OK. You'll find better at mid priced Asian buffets in California. Grilled meats and seafood bar were very good as was the dessert station. If I had to wait two hours, then it would have not been worth it. New system when l where you register and come back later worked well. No wait to register and we paid and were seated with 10 minutes of return.. . Overall, for the price I'd say 3.5 stars but with the short wait for a Saturday, I will round up to 4 stars.
Without a doubt, the best buffet in Vegas now.. No contest.. Puts other casino buffets to shame.. . People reading this 3 months from now will think I'm a lying prick, but let this document serve as a testament that at this point in time and space, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's is the most kick-ass buffet in town.. . As we all know, things in Vegas have a way of changing, sometimes from minute to minute.  When the next mega-resort opens, the crown will certainly change, but it will definitely take a page from Bacchanal's playbook.. . Caesar's has upped the bar for what Buffet's can and should provide.. . It ain't cheap, over fifty bucks a head for dinner, but you get Kwality, with a capital "K"!. Rumor has it that Caesar's spent over $17million on the remodel and food upgrades.  The money was well-spent.  Selection is mind-boggling.  Most items are made in small batches to maintain quality and freshness.. I also like the fact that the kitchen seems to allow some discretion with the menu.  Not all the offerings are directed towards the Western palatte, and as many of the cooks are Mexican, Filipino, or Chinese, some offerings are more "ethnic" than what you'd expect.  I had a Mexican menudo soup that rivaled anything served at my local tacqueria!  When I told the timid midwesterner that it was tripe soup, she nearly fainted... . I like that the kitchen takes chances like this.  All of their food may not appeal to the average joe, but there's interesting and tasty stuff on the menu if you keep your eyes and mind open.. . During peak Vegas season, plan on eating at oddball times (e.g. 6am breakfast or 3pm dinner), if you don't like waiting in lines.  Otherwise, plan on at least a 2-3 hour wait.  Caesar's does have a neat computerized reservation kiosk that will text you when to return, but it only means that you return to a 30-40 minute line.... . So either spend like a whale at Caesar's to get comped line passes, or plan accordingly.  You have been warned.. . One warning, stay away from the peanut butter stuffed chocolate cookies at the dessert bar.  . Those little bastards are more addicting than heroin.
We bought the 6 buffets in 24 hours deal. We paid the extra cost in order to try this buffet. It was worth it - probably double! A never ending array of everything you could crave. And not the seasonless, cheapest costing foods that they can make the most money on type of food.  Everything was so delicious - I can't wait to go back!
It's my first time trying this place. The machines to sign up was pretty much all having issues. The only way to bypass the issue is if you put down some event, such as a birthday or anniversary on it. . . The food was mediocre and their truffle items was overpowered with all truffle. Their hot boiled crab legs came out smoking, but was really luke warm.. . I don't think I would come back here again anytime soon.
Hands down, best buffet in Vegas. Haven't tried it? What are you waiting for!?. . FOOD: Selection is overwhelming in a good way. Love how they separate the "hot" crab legs in a different section which helps with the lines. A few highlights, the Asian soups are surprisingly good, for example the Pho. We all know how long it takes to make the broth and Bacchanal is on point. The best prime rib still goes to the Wynn and Bellagio though, Bacchanal lacks marbles. Also, dessert bar is amazing. Mochi ice cream ftw. . . AMBIANCE: Nice decor, not over the top but effort was made. Casual dress with a casual atmosphere. . . SERVICE: I love their new ticket system. Prior to it, you had to wait in a fat gigantic line ranging from 1-3 hours. Now, it's like the Disneyland fastpass system. Walk up to the machine, grab a number, and come back when it's your turn. From that point, it's another 20 or so minutes (depending on time of course). . . PARKING: Never stayed at this hotel, but all Vegas hotels have free parking. . . Overall: If youhad one buffet to go to in Vegas (or anywhere for that matter), make it Bacchanal.
Can't come to vegas without eating at Bacchanal! I recommend this buffet to anyone who has never tried it because I promise they won't be disappointed. Yes, it is always packed and there is always such a long wait but honestly any buffet worth it's salt is going to have tons of people wanting to eat there. They actually improved their system by installing these kiosks at the front. You put your name and number of people in your party and it tells you when to come back. Faster and you don't waste your time standing in line, you can go take a nap or gamble or do whatever you want. Yes, it is a bit on the pricey side but honestly for the variety and quality of food they offer I think it is so worth it. I love their seafood offerings, especially the oysters and crab legs. After a dozen oysters, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth right there. The charcuterie section is fun to nibble on and I'm a sucker for the Asian food section...pho, ramen, and porridge. What other buffet really has that?! Not to mention, the dessert offerings are to die for. I try to leave more than enough room for dessert because I want to eat EVERYTHING! Bacchanal is food heaven to me.
Best buffet I've ever had! Really pricey but the seafood is so fresh and the quality of everything was top notch. . . There were very very few things I had that I didn't like. The highlights were the duck, fried rice, spicy tuna sashimi, and gelato. My husbands only complaint was he wished they had lobster (we went on a Thursday so maybe they have it on the weekends). . . I feel it is well worth the money and line :)
I'd give Bacchanal a 3.5 star rating if I could.  I visited 3 buffets while in Vegas and this one was the best by far.. . We came around 8pm on a Thursday.  The wait was only 15 minutes.  However, I was not very pleased with the waitstaff.  No one approached us for the first 15-20 min we were there and we kept trying to flag someone down for water, but they were all rushing around with their heads down.  Annoying.  The waitress we did have was about as friendly as an angry lion.... . The food was pretty good though.  I was expecting to be blown away, as indicated by most of the reviews and pictures.  There were lots of dishes for the Chinese New Year and the dim sum were delicious.  I liked that they had made-to-order stations for different soups (pho, congee, etc) but no one was around to serve them.  Prime rib was decent- it had a nice salt crust on it, but wasn't very tender (surprisingly the best prime rib we had was at the Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood!).. . I am a big seafood lover, so I took full advantage of that area.  The crab legs were pretty standard.  The shrimp were big and very flavorful.  Mussels were small, but fresh.  I was amazed to see that they had oysters, but not so impressed that 2 of them I had were not shucked very well and I got a bit of grit and shell when I slurped... Not good eats.. . I think I'd be willing to return to Bacchanal, but there are a lot of other great restaurants in Vegas!
We are always in Vegas and decided to try the new buffet at Ceaser's. We were very disappointed. We were very happy upon arrival to see how large the buffet was, and yes they had a large selection of food. The biggest annoyance of this place was that only about 30% of the food was labeled. I have food issues so I need to know what I'm about to eat. I can't imagine I'm the only one that wants to know what kind of food they are about to consume. Of what I tried that was labeled, most of it was good. I had lobster benedict which was very tasty. My boyfriend had crab benedict and watermelon juice which he enjoyed. The pancakes however were crispy and the shrimp iny shrimp and grits was very mealy and tough. All in all I would not return simply because I like to know what I'm eating. I'll stick to Wicked Spoon down at Cosmo.
This place is very decent for a buffet. It's hard for buffet food to be tasty since they are left under hot lamps and just overcook. The grill station was good: lamb chops, beef ribs, prime rib. The crab legs were just average. Don't come here if you are just paying to stuff yourself of crab legs. With the same amount of money, go to costco & buy some king crab legs. The cocktail shrimps were okay. Lots of selection for dessert, but nothing really stood out.
Their Asian selections are amazing.
Sadly disappointed. . Not sure if it was an "off" night for this 4 star yelped restaurant but I was quite surprised.  Someone needs to tackle quality control.. . Nothing seemed fresh, the food looked as though it was presented well, but tasted like stale leftovers (I hate leftovers).  ALL the cut  meats were completely dried out and tough (yes.. Ribs, prime rib, turkey.. Dry and tough).  The Asian cuisine made me sick.. Seriously the only things worth eating 1) pizza was editable, and 2) the ice cream was yum.. . I will not be returning!
Really? Is this really the 'best buffet in Vegas?' This place was a huge huge huge disappointment. The first time I came here, I waited an hour in line and then ended up leaving when I found out the line was another 2 hours...ugh. This past time, I was happy to see that you could get a slip of paper with a time to come back so you could go do other things for awhile and come back. Great idea! We came back 90 min later... only to find out that there were 2 more lines to wait in. Seriously?!?! Why even have the paper? Just call me when you are actually ready. We waited another 45 min or so to pay ( a ridic 65$ ish with a prepaid tip) and be seated. Why? They kept letting people ahead who paid to skip the line. That is ridiculous and infuriating. Anyway, when we finally got in, we were overwhelmed by the amount of food there. It was a ton. Unfortunately, pretty much none of it was good. There was one dumpling I got that was good, but upon returning, they didn't have anymore. Tried to ask of they had more and the man behind the counter claimed a different dumpling was it (not the case, clearly...one was shrimp one was pork). The pastas were all disappointing...flavorless..boring. The pho was ok, but the ramen was gross. The lamb chops were way underdone...super red...ew. Poor lambs. The seafood was overly fishy...not too fresh. The Mexican food was awful... my friend actually spit it out. The only good items were the mac and cheese, the cheese (duh), and the yellow curry. The desserts were a joke...flavorless again. The service was awful. We never got a refill on our drinks. Plates sat on our table ready to be cleared for a long time. I would never go back here and never recommend.
What is there not to love about this buffet? Ok maybe the price is steep and the wait is ridiculously long but its well worth it. Wicked Spoon use to be my favorite buffet in Vegas but sadly its been going down hill over the past few years. Luckily Bacchanal came along. I miss how when it first came out it wasn't as crowded. Now the wait is like 4 hours. At least they have a kiosk where you can put your name on the wait list, what is cool is that if you have a US number they can text you when they're ready for you. The only downside is you have 15 minutes to check in and the estimate is not very accurate. One time we got a text 40 minutes before the estimated time and there was traffic. The last time we got a text about an hour and a half earlier than expected and we were across the strip. We made it both times though whew. I usually don't eat peeled shrimps at buffets they're just unappealing to me but it;s sooo good here and they're big. Love their juice in little jugs, the horchata one is good. There is a lot of variety of food and the quality is good. Not many buffets have good desserts but they have fairly good desserts here especially the ice cream! I think they replaced the mochi ice cream with ice cream sandwich, I prefer the mochi. They now have shaved ice!!!! Pretty tasty and the green tea flavor was on key. I wish they have more toppings though such as fresh fruits. The macarons aren't too shabby some aren't extremely sweet. Its hard to find macarons that aren't overly sweet.
If the fresh corn tacos are there. You need to get it. ASAP. Amazing with beef and pico de gallo. . . -Lamb was also excellent, even for a buffet. Medium rare and very flavorful. . -salmon and tuna sashimi were on point. I usually never trust sushi at buffets, but it had me coming back for more. So fresh.. -udon was a bit off. So was the ramen. I thinks the soups went bad or something.. -miso cod was hard and extremely salty with the miso.. -try the TRUFFLE SCALLOPED POTATOES. I was crying tears of joy after the first bite.. . Went here on a Thursday and got in after 15minutes. Wouldn't dare coming here on a weekend. Some people wait up to 3 hours. I don't think it's worth that long however.
One of the best restaurants ive ever ate at. Worth any price! The food, service, and dining was just amazing!!!! Cant wait to come back!!!!!
Came on a Tuesday night and paid about $55 (without tip). Sounds like a lot of money, but trust me, you have to go to this buffet if you're in Vegas :D Spend 2 hours and you're GOOD! . . I thought it was funny how one of the host took a picture of me and my friend. Apparently, they were one of the top buffets, so they were celebrating haha. . . Right when you enter, you see all the DELIGHTFUL seafood - oysters (YES!), clams, king crab legs, mussels, shrimp, etc. Don't forget your cocktail and tarter sauce. I ate my oysters with EXTRA lemons and sriracha - yum! . . Then you head towards the meat station. Prime rib, lamb chops, assorted sausages (kielbasa), etc. They have FRIES, SWEET POTATO FRIES, and TATER TOTS! Ahh! . . Next to that station is MEXICAN food! Custom made tacos. Omg... . . If you go into the next room area, you find Italian and Asian food. Geez, does it get any better? Pastas, assorted cheese/salami/prosciutto, variety of salads, udon, ramen, SUSHI SUSHI SUSHI, rolls, shu mai, dumplings, egg rolls, stir fry, etc., etc., and etc. . . In the middle of the buffet, you find a dessert bar. Macarons, crepes, cookies, ice cream, mini treats, chocolate covered strawberries, etc. . . Eat. Talk. Eat. Dessert break. Eat. Eat once more. End with a delicious dessert. :D . . Enjoy!
Beware physically challenged people! The policy of Caesars Palace is that if you are physically challenged and using a cane, a Walker , or a wheelchair, you will be allowed in by yourself, however if you are with somebody else they will have to pay an additional $20 to go through the handicap line with you. This can be very problematic, especially if you are a diabetic and have to eat at a certain time with medications and insulin. I can see this for presenting a problem in light of the expense of the meal. The additional $20 is ridiculous when you consider the cost of a meal itself . I guess Caesars is going to go broke if they don't charge that extra $20 . I guess most people wouldn't have much sympathy, seeing as . this means somebody would jump the line , but in most cases we would only have one additional person with us as a helper .. I consider this highway robbery, and will not be spending my dollars at Caesars again!. Sure the food is great there, but there is so many other buffets in town of close or equal value and quality that do assist the handicapped that it is not worth they extra money and time.
I've been here twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner!. . I enjoyed my brunch/lunch visit much more personally!  Perhaps the BOTTOMLESSCHAMPAGNE/MIMOSAS had something to do with it?  I'd say yes LOL.. . Most everything seemed the same lunch vs dinner as far as selection is concerned.  I didn't notice anything tasting better/worse more fresh etc...seems very consistent here.. . Some highlights :. . The Lamb (dinner) was outstanding...almost perfect actually as far as taste and consistency goes in my book.  Very simply seasoned...it's just tender and not gamey at all.  Fork-pull-apart tender!. . Andouille Sausage (dinner) also great!  Lots of flavor...yum :). . The Ribs here are good!  SUPER meaty, fatty, and yummy....wish they were more tender though....but alas, we are in Buffet world, not slow cooked wonderland.. . Cajun Shrimp, Ceviche, and Oysters (dinner). Everything was good, even the oysters completely naked!  I'd rack up on Oysters next go around :P. . They offer hot and cold snow crab...no other choices of crab.  I choose hot, but I get a bit tired of the super sweet crab...wish they had Dungeness or King, esp at this price point.. . Truffle Scallop Potatoes (dinner)...just like it sounds, and yes, there is a good amount of truffle oil :). . There is some decent stuff in the Chinese/Asian area...the dim sum is just ok, duck was good though, but the Spicy Fish is great!  I'd recommend snaggin a piece or three while you are over there :). . Crab Benedict (brunch). This was perfect, with semi sweet crab and a delicious hollandaise sauce. Yummy!. . Lobster Biscuits and Gravy (brunch). Pretty good as well! I enjoyed the Crab Benedict more though... . . As far as dessert goes :. . Lava Cake is perfect!! I should have grabbed two more of em, but I was full by the time I remembered dessert LOL. . Chocolate Mousse dessert...can you really go wrong with anything that has a mini Oreo on it??. . Great buffet...expensive...but good way to do Vegas :)
We stopped in for lunch. No waiting in line on a Tuesday. The price was a bit on the high side for us ($35 each), but we were not disappointed. Lots of interesting food items stuffed everywhere. The buffet zig-zags into another room, so make sure you check out all of it. The dessert section was mind blowing. Lots, maybe too much to choose from. . If you're going to pay this much for a buffet, you better arrive absolutely starving.
DINNER ONLY REVIEW:. Expensive? Absolutely. Worth it? Depends on what you eat. I easily ate my price worth of hot crab legs, lamb and chocolate covered strawberries so I cannot complain about the price. However I think it is around 15 dollars overpriced (though in comparison to other buffets in the city it is fairly priced). It is hands down the best buffet in Vegas that I have eaten at. . . The service was really good as well, both my individual table server/bussers, and the buffet servers were all very friendly/helpful. . . The Asian food section was not good in my opinion at all. It was the main downside to this buffet experience. The section is MASSIVE which I was excited about, but most of the food was very flavorless and seemed like it had been sitting out way too long (which I somewhat expect for a buffet, but it was exceptionally bad here). . . P.S. Hot crab legs are way better than the cold ones they have piled up on the buffet line. If you ask the guys at the pasta station, they will gladly fill a plate up with some hot ones for you.
My new fav buffet in Vegas great selection of sea food! Crab legs and sushi are fresh and delicious.
Just like they claim in all their ads around town - Best buffet in Vegas! Many buffets have a lot of different types & styles of food to offer just like this one, but if you compare each dish alone to the quality of a restaurant that specializes in that type, the buffet food doesn't hold it's own. But not here! . . Each dish ranked in the top 3 I've ever had, from the beef brisket and ribs, to their pizza, Thai food. I could have stayed on one style of food & would have been completely satisfied! The night before, we ate at another well known buffet and I was disappointed by the quality but with the quantity of different types made the dinner alright. There may have been only 2-3 dishes I'd even want to go back for seconds. Here I wished I could have, on pretty much every dish but the stomach wouldn't let me.. . I did straddle the meal between lunch & dinner (which started at 3pm) to get the lower $ (35 instead of 50). Yes it's a bit pricey but SOOO worth it!
As a rule I loathe buffets. Our friends were in town and wanted to eat here. The price is high,the wait is long ( you get a pass that tells you when to come back, think Disneyland Fast Pass) and you feel like cattle waiting to get in. The place is very pretty but a little confusing to figure out where the different food stations are, and the plates are tucked away under the food areas. . The food was very good,and many dishes were pre portioned into little plates/bowls. The wait for the seafood is very long,but people waited patiently in line. This is not your normal buffet, with people shoving in front and children running wild..  The cod with miso was fabulous, and I loved the dim sum area,it's very tiny but very good. You can also get fresh Pho, ramen or udon soup,along with anything you could think of to add.. There is something for everyone here,from sushi to hot dogs,lamb to shrimp. The desserts are beautiful.macaroons to a dozen flavors of gelato and a made to order crepe station.
ANCIENT ROMANS & BUFFET. . Las Vegas is known for their buffets but it is the Ancient Romans who mastered the concept. The buffet concept is synonymous with the Ancient Romans and it's fitting that the best buffet in Vegas is inside Caesars Palace. The reason why I love Bacchanal Buffet is taking the Ancient Romans concept of buffet into a modern approach. Sure there is no exotic dishes like flamingos that were served during Ancient Rome in this buffet but the variety and quality of food remains the same. This is coming from someone that despises buffets in general. The last time I ate at a buffet in Vegas was a little more than two years ago at Wicked Spoon. I had a terrible experience there. The waiting line for Saturday brunch at Wicked Spoon was two hours long. Then my friend and me rushed to eat for 45 minutes because the brunch menu would be over. The experience at Bacchanal Buffetwas much better than Wicked Spoon.. . Last Thursday night I paid for my friend's birthday. We came here around 5:30PM. Surprisingly there wasn't a long line. That was because we didn't go to the buffet on a Friday night our weekend. Knowing that there is an abundance of items at Bacchanal Buffet I took a strategic approach. Instead of placing lots of items in the plate I took 3 items at a time. This allowed me to get more plates than I normally get. At most buffets after three plates I'm stuffed. But getting three items at a time I was able to eat nine plates of food. I knew I wasn't going to eat all the 500 dishes. I had to place a priority of items. No standard items that I would normally get - fried chicken, pizza, pasta, tacos, Chinese food, etc. I was sticking to dishes that are rare in buffets in general.. . There were certain sections that stood out. The meat section included brisket, prime rib, and lamb chops. I couldn't think of any other buffets that have lamb chops. Having beef brisket rather than the typical roast beef is one feature that makes Bacchanal Buffet stand out from others. The seafood section was exceptional also. On the seafood section you can see shuckers take out the top half of the oyster. I love how the raw oysters are smaller than the raw oysters at typical buffets because the smaller oysters are sweeter. In addition I love how there is not only two types of cooked crab legs (cold and hot), but also how the crab legs are opened for you. How many times when you go to a buffet that you have to work to crack open the crab legs that leaves your hands messy? The one section that surprised me the most is the dessert section. There are varieties that I don't see at a normal buffer. While most buffets have ice cream at Bacchanal Buffet there is gelato. In addition there is creme Brule at Bacchanal Buffet. Think of a normal buffet that has creme Brule for dessert?  . . The fact that I didn't try every dish makes me want to go back to Bacchanal Buffet in the future to try certain dishes I didn't have last time.  For example if I go back to Bacchanal Buffet I would like to go for breakfast/ brunch so I can try the red velvet pancakes.. . I'm not necessary keen on a decor of a restaurant but inside Bacchanal Buffet the minimalist decor makes the setting feel more like a high end restaurant than a buffet eatery. This makes you enjoy eating because you're more relaxed. After eating nine plates of food I was stuffed but not bloated. That is the standard how all buffets should be like with the number of dishes that are provided. Right now for me Bacchanal Buffet met that standard and I can't look at buffets in the same manner as I did before.
So disappointed!!! With all the great pictures and reviews we thought this was going to be fantastic!  We paid $70 per person (included a generous tip) and were so disappointed. . . Quality of sushi sucked.  Paper thin pieces of fish on nigiri and just California rolls as the other options.  Pictures we saw were of king crab legs, we got skinny snow crab legs. Other stations we just ok. Nothing spectacular to justify why we pay so much!!!  . . Staff at the serving stations were so rude. I don't know if they were so busy, but they definitely didn't want to be there.  . . Only thing I could say was the ramen was good. Fresh cooked noodles in great broth. Thanks for the $70 ramen!
Delicious! Love the variety of foods from around the world! Especially the crab legs that were cut in half for easy eating!! :)
One of the better buffets.  I wanted to eat a late lunch early dinner so was planning on going at 2 and maybe wait 1/2 an hour and get in.  Nope.  Even at 2pm on a Saturday, we were told to check in at the computer and come back in 90 min.  The check in process was pain less.  Entered my cell phone number and got a text on when to come back.  Came back and waited another 20 min to pay and get a table.  . The oysters were pretty fresh but everyone takes it so sometimes there isn't much to choose from.  The crab legs weren't as meaty but cut so it is easy to eat.  You can get it warm by the noodle section which was good, don't like cold crabs.  I was surprise the flavor of the dishes were good for a buffet.  Even like the roasted duck and cha sui flavors were almost there.  Some spice not there like authentic Chinese places but better than anything outside of San Gabriel Valley.  Prime rib was good and lamb chop was one of the best I've had, medium would have been nice though, a little over cooked.. Sushi was very thin and no just fish.. The little bottles of juice you can get was ok, nothing to rave about, but nice idea.  But I was happy with my pineapple juice at my table.. I was so full, I was not able to try everything, which says a lot because I always make room to try everything.. We sat next to the dessert station and it was great.  They were constantly refilling the plates.  I never saw the chef stop working at the dessert station.  Noteable was the flan, very creamy.  Macaroons were too chewy.  Gelato was a little too sweet.  They had a lot of green tea flavored items which was nice.  Tried maybe 4 rounds of dessert but that was not all.  Just could not get myself to fit any more.  . Lots of variety.  Good overall flavor to the food.  Prepare to wait a bit.  . I wanted the bottomless champagne but missed it due to the wait so had to take 1 star away.  On the weekends, they have bottomless for brunch/lunch.
I live in Vegas and visit Bacchanal Buffet at least once a month. It is definitely the best Buffet in town; from the wagyu beef sliders to the red velvet pancakes to the au gratin with truffle oil to the dessert bar! Well worth the price, great food, good service, nice atmosphere.
BEST VEGAS BUFFET. . . I think I died and was sent to heaven after eating at this place. Like no, seriously. I ate so much of everything that I knocked out from a food coma right after. There were so many options to choose from! There is a station for every almost every cuisine.. . What's my favorite? Their 5 star gourmet dessert bar!!! Imagine creme brulee, gelato, macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, crepes, and other beautifully created sweets you can think of.
The best buffet I have ever had in my life. I feel I could come to LV just for this buffet (but this is the only buffet I tried in LV). The Bacchanal buffet makes the trip to LV memorable for me.
Let me start by saying that I'm normally not a fan of buffets... People touching the same serving utensils, food sitting out for hours on end, etc. Ugh!!!! So when the BF suggested that we try Caesar's buffet, I wasn't the most excited. When we arrived, there was a huge crowd waiting outside but the process the hotel uses to herd people in is actually rather effective. The food was absolutely worth the wait! The buffet offers selections from all over the world in a very organized fashion. There weren't too many instances where you had community utensils - most dishes were served on plates as individual servings. The fresh seafood was awesome but I was slightly disappointed that the oysters wouldn't be available until later in the afternoon. The Kobe slider was scrumptious and the Mediterranean salads were delish as well. . Being of AA decent, my temporary moment of shame was how excited I got over their fried chicken - yes I liked it because it was delicious and it rivaled my mama's! Don't judge me! The dessert bar lacked just a tad but I think this had to do with the time of day we were there. There's no question that I will be back here on my next visit to Vegas... You can't knowingly pass that kind of deliciousness up!
If you're looking for a quality buffet this is not it! If you're looking for variety and quantity then this 1 might cut it. In my opinion this buffet is not worth $50? $30 max!
One of the best buffets I've had anywhere. Love the variety of meats at the carving station. Great paella and Chinese food section. We went on friday night around 7pm...the wait was about 90 minutes...but well worth the wait. Price was $34 per person, which is cheap for a dinner buffet in Vegas. Would go again for sure.
Horrible!!! I'm now suffering from food poisoning ! . . To start off I actually liked some of the food, though some of it was way too salty! And the variety isn't all what it's cracked up to be... Well now thanks to this place I'm very ill... I promise this is the source of my sickness bc this is the only food I've eaten all day....
CRAB LEGS, LAMB CHOPS, AND MACARONS. . . Straight up, these lamb chops are some of the best lamb chops I've had ANYWHERE and I've had a lot of lamb chops. Well seasoned, crisp in all the right parts, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, these lamb chops really set the standard for all future lamb chops to be had. Love them. . . PRO TIP: Buffet switches over from lunch to dinner at 3pm. So, show up at 2:30pm, pay your $38 lunch fee, enjoy a few light appetizers, then wait for the magic to happen at 3pm. That's when all the best things come out. . . Cheers to gluttony!
Sadly I have to update my prior review of this place. I visited on October 2013 and I was so happy with my overall experience that I mistakenly made it a point to visit again on Feb 16, 2014.. . .           For starters this is currently the "#1 buffet" in Vegas and its advertised everywhere you go in Vegas thus making it extremely popular. I firmly believe that it started out as a wonderful buffet. However now it has gone down the drain with its horrible customer service.. .          For instance as you approach the buffet you are assaulted with big crowds of people trying to figure out what to do. Moreover as you get a glimpse of what everyone is crowding around its a monitor that allows you to input your party information. It then prints out a ticket informing you of the wait time encouraging you to go the surrounding shops and or casino instead of waiting in line and you will receive a text message letting you know when your time is up. (for me it was a 2 hour and 30 minute wait) The idea of it all is great. However in practice it is extremely unpractical to believe that crowds of people visiting your establishment will figure out exactly what to do with those little monitors. Consequently making it a big confusion for a lot of the patrons visiting the establishment. Then finally when you see a human face Patrons flock to the person asking him/her what are the steps to sign in. The "hostess' rudely responds that you must use the monitor with no inclination to assist you in using it. Granted it is not rocket science here in the states similar monitors are now everywhere with "self checkout" being extremely popular. However I feel that she was incredibly inconsiderate to people asking for assistance. More importantly there are patrons that truly do not understand the concept of checking in  on a monitor. I can understand that she is probably assaulted with the same question over and over again and it might be incredibly overwhelming to repeatedly answer the same question..  . . .          However  rudeness is never acceptable. Secondly and more importantly after patiently waiting for an over two hours I directed to my table. Ironically the restaurant is beautifully designed however there where empty tables everywhere with dirty dishes stacked on them. It seems as if they paid so much attention to detail however the dirty dishes throw away all that effort.  It definitely killed my appetite. After 15 minutes of waiting we still had no waitress no utensils no drinks. I quickly became infuriated at the fact that I had wasted TWO HOURS of my life waiting to enter this dirty restaurant with incredibly inconsiderate staff. I asked the "hostess" if our waitress/waiter would show up anytime soon with which she replied " she is making her rounds." I was FLABBERGASTED. I have no problem with waiting my turn however after paying $60 dollars a plate and waiting more than 2 hours to be seated I expect for them to have it more under control and at the very least have some kind of human empathy. I WILL ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAIN VISIT THIS ESTABLISHEMENT AND DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO SPEND A DOLLAR HERE. The food is ok but for the most part Rio offers the same food for a fraction of the wait time and better customer service. Mc Donald's workers have better training and service than the workers at this place.
A must try Vegas buffet when you stop by the city! The rave here is REAL guys!!!. . Prices here can get expensive, especially on weekends but it really is a buffet you must try once in your lifetime. Good buffets with great quality food are hard to come by!! The line to wait will get long, only dandy thing is that you can leave your name, phone number, and number of people at table down and they will call you when your table is ready (usually the wait is 2 hours) BUT you can pay $15 to cut the line and go inside.. . I was really hungry by the time I came so I just paid the extra $15 and headed inside the eat. First thing, the place is so nicely decorated! Second, free unlimited mimosas!??? WHAT!??? . . Okay, back to the food. SO many varieties! Steamed crabs!?? Mussels?? Oysters??? Egg tarts, flan, and so so so much more. I was already full looking at all of the food. To feel like I got my money's worth I mainly ate seafood so sorry guys I don't know what the meat quality was like but it looked good! The crab legs was AMAZING. Get it steamed!!! The mussels were like heaven in my mouth and oysters were bommmb too. The desert area was also my favorite as they provided so much and you can request for some item fresh like the egg tarts!. . I really like this place but don't think I can afford to come back here anytime. It was a great experience and I got to say I enjoyed a high end buffet. . . I recommend:. - Oysters. - Flan. - Egg tart. - Mussels (the ones with two shells). - Shrimp (HUGEEE). - Crab legs (steamed)
As a local, I was excited to try "the best buffet in Vegas," it isn't. I've visited these buffets here, Studio B, Feast (GVR and Red Rock), Palms, and Bacchanal. If you're local or have access to a car, do yourself a favor and drive to The M for Studio B's, food is comparable to Bacchanal, and far cheaper. If you're a strip captive, Bacchanal is good, you'll be $50 poorer but satisfied. . . Got in line at 6:00p on Wed night and were seated at 6:30. We stayed longer than the 2 hours allowed (shame) and no one bothered us about it. Service is excellent, drinks refilled and plates removed in a timely manner. It's a buffet, I didn't expect too much. . . Honestly, unless you're going to eat your weight in crab legs, $50 (no longer includes beer and wine?!?! Come on Caesars!) is way too much to pay for sodium overload. Chinese: salty. . Curry: salty and I still smell like coconut. . Salad: prepareds were over dressed, not enough choices for build-your-own. . Meats/cheese: good. . Italian: didn't try anything but ratatouille but good. . Mexican: greasy and sitting out too long, carnitas were there before we arrived and still sitting there as we left. . American: sides were good, meats were just ok, fried stuff wasn't crispy. Disappointed. . Seafood: good,I tried to eat $50 worth. . Juice bar: good. . Dessert: was expecting better, honestly, overall kinda tasteless and too sweet. I recommend the lava cakes. . Sushi: I felt there should've been more choices for a $50 buffet. Disappointed. . Things to try: seafood, chef's specials, small plates. . . It's nice to be able to walk the forum shops to help digest but I'll just head to The M for my buffet binges in the future.
Definitely my new favorite buffet. I would give it 5 stars but I'm cheap and don't like the $50 price tag. But the food was excellent. Huge shrimp cocktail, warm king crab legs, great selection of Chinese and Thai food. The Mexican station had tacos which reminded me of the taco stands in Mexico. Althea American BBQ station had a lot to choose from. All tasting really good. Oh and they had sweet potato tater tots and Parmesan garlic fries which were fantastic. If you don't mind the $50 per person dinner price then try this place. It's awesome. Even though I'm cheap I will still be stopping by the next time I'm in town.
Somewhere between 3-4 stars. Food, yep, great selection. The oyster bar alone is worth is. It is super expensive and yes, you have to wait 2 hours. Just go put your name in and get the ticket, which tells you what time to come back. Once you go back, you could end up waiting to be seated. We went early--pulled a ticket on Sat night at 4. Came back at 5:45 and got seated at 6. Service is not great, but I have never been to a buffet with good service. It's worth trying it once. $55ish for dinner.
I had been reading all the good and bad reviews on here and decided to go ahead and take a shot and eat here.  I went to Las Vegas about 6 years ago with a friend and only ate at the Bellagio Buffet.  I came back to Vegas with my mom this time and we wanted to try and eat at some of the many different buffets that Vegas has to offer.  Well we decided to try this one as our last stop on our trip.  So we got in line at about 2:45 pm and got the lunch price of 35.99$ instead of the dinner price of 50:99$.  Dinner starts at 3 pm so we got to experience both lunch and dinner for the cheaper price and I am sure glad we did.  I wouldn't recommend paying 50$ for this buffet.  I am the type of person who loves going out to eat and I also like eating a ton of variety too.  The service was awesome, so nothing wrong with that.  I took a little tour around and looked at all the food before I put anything on my plate.  I wanted to try a lot of different items so I thought well it is a buffet so why not.  Probably the only thing I liked was the mashed potatoes and the california roll sushi.  The crab legs were frozen still, but when you got a piece that wasn't they were very sweet, just didn't want to get plate after plate and only getting about a few pieces that weren't frozen.  I did get them to steam them for me and when they did that the crab legs had NO flavor at all.  So I don't recommend crab legs as one of their main point getters from people.  I am not a fan of much else in the seafood department unless its fried shrimp.  I went to the asian station and ate a few pieces of sushi and thought that the Bellagio had them beat.  Mostly all the food was kind of bland.  I would not want to go back and try it on another night but if you are in Las Vegas and really want to go to a buffet then why not go and try for yourselves!!  Only you can really judge the food not just by reading a review, we can only suggest to you some pointers!!  The desserts were really bad too.  No flavor at all.  I enjoyed the Bellagio Buffet much better.  Even the buffet at the Wynn is better.
Our first trip to bacchanal after it's opening was a wow factor. We have dinned there  a number of times since it's opening.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I  have done them all.  It  is  only 2nd to the Bally's sterling Sunday brunch at bally's ( closed for renovation to accommodate  BLT  steakhouse restaurant ). I'm done, the wow factor is still there.
Am I the only one who thought Bacchanal was pronounced "back-anal"? Depending on whom you ask, "ba-ke-nal" can mean one of the following:.    .      (1) an orgy.      (2) a wild gathering involving excessive drinking & promiscuity.      (3) the worship of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, ritual madness & ecstasy. . Or "a feast worthy of Gods," according to Caesars Palace. Despite the questionable meaning of the name, we decided to have a late lunch here after eating at Wicked Spoon the night before, to compare the two highest-rated buffets in Vegas. As of now, Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are on the same tier of best buffets in Sin City and I honestly can't decide which is better.. . The wait was over an hour long. Bacchanal's decor and ambience is definitely more contemporary and modern than other Vegas buffets, and I believe overall caters more to "foodies" -- especially in terms of food presentation, which was bordering molecular gastronomy. The buffet spread was impressive and thebroad selection consisted mostly of tapas, including pho, ramen, various cuisines, and plenty of desserts to choose from. As I'm not a fan of buffets (I prefer quality over quantity), I don't quite exactly remember what I ate -- just that I didn't hate anything and there were enough tasty things to eat to get full and feel fully satisfied. I do recall that although the desserts were very aesthetically pleasing, most tasted surprisingly underwhelming.. . Despite me not remembering any of the food I ate, mostly due to me not taking any photos, I'd still come back a second time to give it another try before passing final judgement.
Tried the lunch buffet and it was delicious. We didn't wait long (since our sis was in line but she was only there around 20min) It was very bright and nicely decorated (though wicked spoon has better decor). The food was good, typical "nice" vegas buffet, everything from omelets, ratatouille, burger sliders, to crab legs, sausage, ribs,italian cold cuts,  etc. i didn't like the chinese & Thai, it seemed old. (Not much traffic so food sat there) Sushi was ok. I liked the crab benedict and mango juice in glass bottles. Dessert was good, but the cakes were just ok. We liked the gelato (salted caramel, nutella ) Also includes mimosas which was a plus. Not sure i'd  go back for lunch since it was pricey and nothing was really 'out of this world' good. Service was great.
Great BBQ at lunch! Great Buffet all around.  Best I've ever been to in Vegas.
maybe because I had expected more.. . maybe because I had heard they served tomahawk steaks. but then they didn't.. . maybe because Bacchanal fell victim to my cognitive dissonance. of a quality selection versus a variety of quantity.. . Whatever the reason maybe. I was not impressed.. . That's to say it wasn't good,. Bacchanal is a very good buffet.. . The layout of the seating is. quite comfortable. and cozy when. considering the size of the place.. . The steamed king crab legs were hella tasty. (and even better with a little clarified butter).. . Lamb chops were also superb.. . And overall, the quality of the food. was nothing less than you . would expect from Caesars.. . And if you are planning on having. only one buffet on your Vegas excursion,. this would be a fine choice.. . The problem this yelper. has with Bacchanal is this:. I, for sure, know a couple. other buffet places where I could. have gotten the same quality and selection. for less.. . And there the rub.. . Where are these place you may ask?. . Check out my Vegas list on Yelp. (which I'm continually compiling and updating. as we speak). or look for upcoming link. to my blog eatery.
I'll make this easy. This is the best buffet in Vegas, maybe the USA. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. We ate here on a Thursday night so we did have to wait about 45 min. The selection is overwhelming, from custom tacos, to Kobe sliders, to scalloped potatoes with truffle sauce...you really have to scout the buffet  once you are there, don't start taking food...be strategic. Most importantly, leave room for dessert. This buffet is utterly amazing....
My favorite buffet in Vegas so far. I love the new waiting system: at check in you are given a time estimation and told you will receive a text message when your table is ready. There is no need to wait in long lines and gives you time to explore and gamble! fThe quality of food is impeccable and wait staff is very nice. One of our friend's wasn't feeling too well and the wait staff offered her some tea (for hangovers) and ultimately gave her a refund because she never even touched the food. I would come back everyday if my stomach (and wallet) could handle it.
This place is amazing!! I managed to get through 3 food rounds & 1 massive dessert round & all I can think of is when can I return to Vegas & eat here again. We got here around 1130am on Sunday picked a good time because while we waited about 30min to get in, by the time we sat down the line was ridiculous. The only thing that could have made this buffer more enjoyable would be more breakfast selection. I know I got here at 1130 but that's a perfect time to still get stuff it just would have been nice to see more. . . Also the pretzel rolls are beyond to die for.
Oh Bacchanal Buffet!!!. How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.. I love thee to the crab and oyster delight. My soul leaps at thy dessert spread sight. For the ends of diets and stuffing my face. I love thee Bacchanal above all buffets.. Most craving need, for crab legs I fight. I love thee ramen station with every bite.. I love horchata in this buffet place. I love thee with a passion put to use. Into my favorites with all my faith. I love thee with a love of food that I choose. With my last bites --- I cherish my dessert spread. Smiles, tears, of all my life! --- and if I so choose. I shall but love thee better always and always and always ..... ("How Do I Love Thee? - Elizabeth Barrett Browning - interpreted for Bacchanal Buffet). . Yes.  I found the one buffet I would be willing to break my diet for over and over again.  As was described to me, this buffet is an experience.. . Seafood Bar: Fresh oysters, crab legs, shrimp, fish, and seafood dishes galore.  Topped with many different sauces for my dipping delight.. . Ramen Station:  Thank goodness for the tiny bowls these are served in.  Let me have room for all the rest of the food.  Although this was delicious already.. . Asian Area: Is the porridge I see?  And I can put fried garlic, green onions, and ... omg, do my eyes deceive me, or is that a century egg?!?!?  YES! Porridge with century egg, my FAVORITE.. . Mexican station:  They had a taco station.  It looked so good, but my stomach was already filling up with all the goodies.  However, I DID stop to take a horchata, which was SO delicious, I want all my horchata drinks to taste like that please!. . DESSERTS!!  DESSERTS!! DESSERTS!!  Pandan Tiramisu.  Have you ever tried it?  You should.  Here at Bacchanal!  And, what I thought was a green tea or pistachio macaron ended up being a pandan macaron!  Yes! All the flavors!  White chocolate covered strawberry topped with strawberry crunchy balls.  Can you say delicious?  And some other goodies like an shaved ice station, creme brulee, cake pops ... is your mouth just drooling right now!?!?!. . We arrive there around 5:30, and surprisingly we came RIGHT BEFORE the line started.  We didn't have to wait at all.  LUCKY US!  Yes, it's $50+, but this buffet is WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  Make sure your stomach is ready for a feast worthy of kings!
I probably shouldn't go to a buffet and call the dim sum and the dessert my favs.  because that would be a waste of my $50+ per person?!?  Thanks to Tracie L for her review that got me thinking that I really needed to eat here.. . Bacchanal, you elusive trendy buffet.  The first time I tried to eat here for brunch they told me to come back in three hours.  Whhattt?  Well now that I have eaten here I can say I went, and ate and prob won't eat here again.  Pluses for their ticket system that cuts down on the frustrating standing in line experience.. . The seafood was average.  Yes, there were crab legs. And yes, you can get them STEAMED in the Asian section.  There were also oysters (not so good), mussels, ceviche, shrimp and shellfish in various sauces.  The seafood didn't rock my world.. Their were some smaller individual sized food like wagyu beef burgers and sea bass.  The sea bass with bok choy was actually one of my fav stand out dishes.  Totally unexpected, but the dim sum in the Asian section was perfectly steamed and delicious (and they wrapper of their hargow didn't stick or break when you tried to eat it).  Other things I liked: individual wedge salads, heirloom tomato salad, steamed crab legs, rack of lamb, and mashed sweet potato.  . . I skipped the Mexican area, most of the Italian, and the majority of the carving station other then the lamb. I know I know, but I hate not having room for dessert. I also wasn't in an 'eat until you feel sick' mood, lol.  I will say that the dessert was as amazing as everyone said.      . . My favs: 1) mango chili lime gelato. Wow what a refreshing combination of flavors after all the mini meal-type dishes I had.  2) macaroons. Enough said.  3) green tea red/bean cookies.  I actually got these thinking it was pistachio, but I was like oohhh is this red bean?  Win!  I mean there were so many desserts that you'd get a stomach ache trying them all.  They also had crepes and shaved ice.  . . I didn't see all the good stuff others ate such as fried chicken and waffles, sweet potato tots or made-to-order souffles. =(  Maybe next time.  The service was pretty good and they refilled my ginger ale enough times. However, the seating area was kind of dirty on the floors. But I understand with the foot traffic in the place it must be hard to clean every little food item that falls.   OH YEAH I must mention the young, skinny Asian couple sitting next to me who seriously killed 4-5 plates of JUST FOOD and 2 of dessert. They didn't even pick around their plates - they ate like champs. I was like whooooaaaaaa.  . .  I am very happy that I got to try this place, but my verdict: way better than Wicked Spoon, but doesn't come close to beating the Wynn.
I had it all planned out. Vegas Buffets 101, some tips from buddies (Thanks Leona for the last minute answers!)- the best time to go to a buffet is between shifts! . . That's when u get to sample both lunch and dinner at Lunch Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I lost a battle and ended up going for dinner at around 4pm, not like j had planned, and after seeing gorgeous displays of desserts, tons of yummy looking stations, you forget about the 40 plus dollars you shelled out. But it all worked out in the end. Cuz you don't have to wait that extra time letting your stomach bloat up waiting for the seafood to come out. You hit that first to make sure you get your money's worth! . . No king crab, but snow crab was decent. Especially since they cut it for you already, so no crab juice in your neighbors eye. I ate plenty. . . Starting from the far end, there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein, fried rice, eggrolls, stir fry, some dim sum dishes, spicy eggplant, yummy greenbeans.. They have Pho, Japo station sucked. Miso soup, sushi rolls. (what i would have loved to have seen for shelling out 50 bucks was some decent sashimi, and maybe some tempura!). Taco station was pretty cool, although i didn't get eat much from this station. . Cheese and cold cuts. Small build your own salad section and small plates of caprese salad. About 5 different pizzas. Meat section: prime rib, ribs, chops, brisket. damn it, i missed the rib eye lollies.. Little pasta, a good fried section: Calamari, sweet potato tater tots, fries, fish and chips. Crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, fish dishes.  You can get either steamed crab legs or chilled ones. (steamed is in another section). HUGE dessert section.. . This was my favorite (obviously).. I got French Toast Gelato, Thai iced tea gelato (pretty cool selection),. macarons, cookies, cupcakes, tiramisu, chocolate cream brulee, cakes galore, cake pops. I saw a crepe station, bread pudding... lots o stuff i didn't have room for.. . Although i loved gorging myself, there were only a few items that i totally loved. The rest was good, but i'm not sure it was 50 bucks worth good. I would come again for sure, but definitely sticking to my guns to come at the lunch price. . . * i went on a monday around 4pm and walked right in. But weekends, i hear can be hours of waiting! Be prepared!
Extremely over hyped. I was so disappointed. This was all very cheap food. Its no better than $10 buffet. I really thought it would live up to all the hype but it didn't. Anyone who thought this was a 4+ star buffet hasn't been to a good one, like Wicked Spoon. Save yourself the grief and spend your money on a quality place.
Definitely the best buffet I've been to, not just in Vegas, but anywhere. Filled almost 4 plates each in the time we were there, and honestly maybe had only 1 or 2 things that we didn't love. Mind you each plate had a selection of stuff. Crab legs were great, cut down the middle for super easy eating and the pad Thai was probably my other absolute favorite. Need to go back so I can try all the stuff I couldn't fit on this trip. Also, great and friendly service from all the staff.
I totally stuffed myself at the seafood bar area. Loved the oysters, mussels, clams, lobster corn chowder. Seafood was worth the money. Around $37 for lunch.. . I didn't have much of an appetite since we just woke up so I didn't get to try very much other food stations. However, I did get to try the porridge station, which was really good. Sushi didn't look appetizing and i tried the tuna and salmon sushi, but didn't taste that fresh. Oxtail soup was superb! Very tender.. . The glass of peach tea that comes with the glass of water when the waitress brings your drinks are so refreshing! I had to ask for refill on the peach tea. So good. . . Service was really attention and friendly.. . I have to come back during dinner when I have more appetite.
Ok let's get right to it, the food taste FANTASTIC here but there are many cons that outweigh why I would prefer to go elsewhere in the future. . . The wait is outrageous if you do not pay extra $15 to get into the express line. You'll never eat when you intend to eat and by the time you have been called back by their ticketing system, it would have been 2 hours since you decided you were hungry. . . $55 price tag is steep. As ironic as it sounds, people aren't always able to eat as much as they thought they could after starving themselves for so long. . . Line to get food. =____=. Okay so after I got in and super excited to eat, there was a long line to get food. . . There is one recommendation I would give if you should decide to come here. I got my ticket at 2pm on a Saturday and was told to come back at 4:15pm (yikes). I had intended to eat brunch at the lower price of 40 bucks, if I were to wait till 4:15 I would have to pay 55 bucks for dinner. I noticed the express line was empty so I decided to just pay the extra 15 to get in right away. They serve dinner food at 3 so it was a win win.
Great service, great variety, and great atmosphere.. . This is my first real review, but I figure I'd do a Vegas buffet. First off I have absolutely no complaints about the service or variety of food. There's a ton of food and you will be taken care of for sure. They will constantly be there to fill you on drinks and everything.. . With that said, let's begin with drinks.. . Peach iced tea - this was a very good drink. Very light, very refreshing, not too sweet, and even seems like a white tea they use. The peach syrup they use is light and sweet, but if you have really sensitive taste buds you will be able to taste the sugar additive they use which is like a diet soda. But it's very slight. My friends loved it and I could taste it, but it did not get in the way of tastiness.. . Mango juice - it's like having a mango in your mouth. But seriously very refreshing. You have to shake it up so that the flavor is evenly distributed, but this is by far the best juice they have there. What I do love is that all of their juices seem to be freshly squeezed and prepared and it's all in one iced area.. . Horchata - the horchata was ok. It was sweet, creamy, and cinnamony, but something about it was different. I don't think I tasted much of the ricy substance that a horchata needs. This was still good, but there are better horchatas out there.. . Main dishes:. . Rack of Lamb - perfectly spiced, cooked really well. Super juicy and has just that nice gaminess that lamb has. Absolutely the best rack of lamb I have ever tasted.. . Prime rib - it's really hard to not do a prime rib right and so this one is pretty good. The first time I had it, it was a little overcooked and not as marbled. Second time around it was much better and the quality was better.. . Crab legs - you really can't go wrong. Best thing about this place, you can get it boiled so it's hot when it comes out.. . Deserts:. . Gelato - You HAVE to try out at least a few of their flavors. Creme brulee, Mango sorbet, tiramisu you cannot go wrong with these.
3 stars for variety and dessert but not for the taste. Been here 2 years ago when it was just 2 months after opening. It was very good, it WAS. Took my parents here expecting king crab leg but they didn't have it, on a Sunday night, I paid $53+tax. Without the king crab leg, it just a regular buffet. When I was here before, the chef helped the customer heat up the king crab leg in the boiling water, now they just do it for snow crab leg and let the crab leg sit in the pot until you ask for it. Almost every food taste very salty, hot and sour soup is bitter after simmering all day. Steamed bun is crusty because no lid covering. So, if you really want, you can ask or walk in to see if they have king crab leg before you pay for nothing.
BEST BUFFET in LAS VEGAS! . . When you first arrive, you have to check into a machine and say how many people are in your party. Afterwards it will print out a ticket of what time you should come back to wait in line to pay and get seated. If you don't want to wait, you can just pay $15 to get into the express lane, but since I am a poor college student, my friends and I just waited. Luckily enough for us, we barely waited. The person who take your tickets let us in before our required time. Yay us! Thank you kind sir. . . $55 bucks for dinner. Totally worth it,  you just need to eat the right food to get your money's worth. . . The place itself is really nice, I love the atmosphere. Unlike other buffets, this buffet isn't crowded where your squish with other tables. There is enough room to breathe and eat. . . The servers are really nice. Our server was very attentive towards us, even when it got busy. I suggest when you guys are ordering your drinks, you should get their sweet ice tea. It was a clear tea, I thought at first it was water, but it wasn't. The tea was very refreshing and good. I could just sit there and sip the tea all day.  . . As for the food, there is so much to choose from. They have LIKE EVERYTHING, from Asian to Mexican to Italian to American and SEAFOOD! Lets not forget their DESSERT too! They have a whole island dedicated to sweets.  . . If you guys are choosing what buffet to eat at your stay at Vegas, I suggest you guys come to the Bacchanal Buffet. You wont regret it, and neither would your family/friends.
I was not impressed, probably because I had high expectations. . We were very lucky to not have to wait in line.. For 2 people for a dinner buffet cost about $110 . The staff was very courteous and welcoming. . They offered to take photos of you upon entering the buffet and then later sell you the photo for $25.. They had seated us near the entrance and it was a bit uncomfortable when you had to navigate around the patrons waiting to be seated back to your table.. The food presentation was great. . I was not impressed with the food selection. . They had big cocktail shrimp and it was good.. The snow crab was bland.. To finish our meal, my husband and I decided to have some coffee and the server offered cappuccino $5 extra to which I believed should of been included, let me tell you Starbucks is better!. . Seafood Section 3.5/5. Salad Section 3/5. Dessert Section 4/5. BBQ Section 3.5/5. Asian Section 3/5. American Section 2/5. Mexican Section 2/5. Service 4/5. Seating 1/5
Best buffet in Vegas.  And I've tried at least a dozen since I've been visiting as a kid.  This place has it all.  Variety, quality and excellent service.  I've come here during different times of the year, and have been exposed to various wait times.  The most recent time, the host said the wait would be about 40 minutes, and we (party of 2) only waited about 20 minutes.  Another time, it was a 2-3 hour wait, and we (party of 2) went straight to the cashier and bought line passes for $15 each and waited less than 5 minutes.  I definitely suggest getting the line pass if the wait is more than a couple hours.  You're in Vegas - don't waste any time and splurge a little! (:. . The food - oysters, steamed crab, miso glazed cod, Asian dumplings, authentic Mexican tacos, BBQ, the list goes on and on.  Every single item I grabbed tasted amazing and fresh.  The dessert bar was incredible.  Build your own crepes, creme brulee, flan, chocolate covered strawberries, mini cakes, cake pops, etc etc of amazing options.  I've also never run into a food selection that was empty - they are great about replenishing their dishes.. . The service - I'm always amazed by the level of service I get when I visit Vegas.  Everyone is always so friendly and hospitable.  . . I like to try new buffets each time I visit Vegas, and would like to one day say I've tried every major hotel and casino's buffet, but Bacchanal will make that difficult to do so.  I'll be back in a few months, Bacchanal.
so excited to first time trying this place what USA Today rated the number buffet in Vegas, food was overflowing with great looking foods, though price was so above average stunning $53 per person, what the heck for a dinner celebrating a birthday of a special person (my self) with a party of 8 an 18% tips is a must, end up paying $545 for dinner. really unforgetable dinner experience, especially when we were back to CA finding out they charge me another extra 18% tip added to my card, lessson learn dont be tooo excited on this place, paying $186 for tip alone was so dissappointing so remember dont be so excited about this and the so callled rated number one buffet in Vegas, because what happpened to me in Vegas i cannot stay it in Vegas, and until now i feel im vomiting for the amount of food i eat? or perhaps the amount of tip they overcharged me. Good luck and if ever anyone dare to see my bill im always happy to show and share it! February 7, 2014 Friday at around 7pm when it was happen
So my two buddies came up with the bright idea of paying credit card roulette. At the Caesar's Buffet no less. Reluctantly I threw my AmEX into the pot. And guess what? My friggin card gets pulled. I was like whatever man. We put our names in the res system and it was a 90 min wait......at 3pm!! Wtf! So we go to the casino to gamble, which of course is what they want you to do.. . Fast forward about 100 min and our names are finally paged. So I go and pay...$200! For 3 of us....oh man I say. I'm gonna milk this for what its worth. We sit down about 430pm. And this is after a night of clubbing and boozing so don't mind us as we lethargically make our way to the table. . . We all scope out the spread and we were awestruck. Never in my life have I seen a spread like this. Anything and everything. They have it. My strategy at buffets is to sample a little of everything. But really on this day, and with this size, I just couldn't do it. I couldn't. I grabbed some japanese food and soup for a "starter", then some crab and shrimp. Then on to the heavier stuff like ribs sausage and other bbq. By this time I was stuffed! But alas, I have a sweet tooth so I had to do dessert. This is where Bacchanal shines, IMO. They got everything here. Macroons, gelato, cakes, cookies, fruit....aww yeah! . . Good value? An unequivocal no! But it is a must try. And you are in Vegas. So just do it. You won't regret it. Until the next morning. Oh and we sat there like the fat a$$es that we were from 430 to almost 9pm! And our hostess, which I won't name because we don't want to get her in trouble, was so awesome. And cute! She let us stay and just engorge ourselves.
The buffet is a little better than typical, but not enough for me to return. . Their specialty, asian, was plentiful, but not extraordinary.. The staff is very nice and the decor is modern.. The miso cod fish was the best.
The desserts failed.. . Food was good. I was really hyped up to go here from the reviews...it was not that amazin but food was good. Indonesian curries , prime rib , etc.....sushi was surprisingly fresh for a buffet.
Once in a while, you need to splurge a little.  I was honestly opposed to their ridiculous price of $65 a person (I think that's what it was), plus their half and hour line was annoying too.  . . They have almost any cuisine you could think of: Italian, Japanese, Cajun, American and more.  My favorite was the mini Cheese Burgers, the Steamed Muscles, the Cream Cheese Wantons, the Sashimi.  Really it was all so good.  I even tried a oyster shooter for the first time.  It was okay.  I guess I'm not a fan.  The desert was great and I had a bunch of it.  There was even Red bean Mochi!. . Words can't describe the food, you need to see the photos.  Come on an empty stomach.
Okay, I normally do not like buffets because although there is a wide selection, there is usually only mediocre food to choose from. I would like to make an exception for Baccahanal Buffet because it is the bomb. There are nine different stations to pick from including this amazing dessert bar and everything I tried was delicious- minus the chef special. That was disgusting. The seafood and dessert bar was by far my favorite.  I like my food so I would go as far as to say this was the best thing I did in Vegas on my weekend there. I spent a little over two hours there and thoroughly enjoyed myself every single minute. I don't care if that makes me sound like a fatass. It's the truth. I would've gone there twice but it's about $60 a person and I lost money gambling so I couldn't..... =(. . If you're going to Vegas, you need to try this buffet. There is a reason it is the #1 buffet in Vegas. It's been a week since I've been there and I miss it already.
One of my favorite buffets in Vegas, I come here mostly for the seafood and the prime rib, but they have basically have an international selection of food. The prime rib is cooked to amazing perfection - the meat is tender, much like the steak you'd get at fancy steakhouses. Their crab legs are fresh too. There is also a wide variety of desserts - basically anything you can hope for. . . The wait is usually very, very long, so now they have a fastpass system so there's not a huge crowd of ppl in front of the restaurant.
Best buffet in Vegas no doubt! Friday lunch was 35$ a person so that's obviously pricey but all the food was delicious! The tacos and brisket are a must!!
Cannot believe how large the food choices was. The closest to the entrance are the seafood; we were here during the weekday dinner, so it was snow crab legs, mussel, and oysters. If you want warm snow crab legs, you can go to pasta station, I think, and they'll dunk them in boiling water for you. . . The wait can be a drag, so be ready for it, but I honestly think it's worth it, even if it's $50 for dinner. The choices are, basically, endless. A lot of things were decent in taste, and could be made better by combining different stuff. For example, the pad thai noodles were way better when you added on the curry that was right next to it, for more flavoring. My friend also got everything that had truffle oil, and those dishes were delicious. I know people usually want feedback of the crab legs and the meat station. Crab legs were great, especially since they had butter. The meat station, I got the prime rib and like the pulled pork? Pulled pork was kind of too fatty, but prime rib was decent. I didn't try the other choices: lamb, rib, sausage. But I was impressed by the prime rib. . . Dessert section was pretty stellar. I usually stay away from those little individual sweet treats, But the strawberry gelato was awesome.... . Definitely would be back next time...even if it's $50 dinner...
