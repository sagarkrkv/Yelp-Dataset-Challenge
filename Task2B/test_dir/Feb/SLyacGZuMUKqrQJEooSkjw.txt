Honestly I don't understand why there are so many low ratings for this buffet. For the price I paid, I think it well worth it. Bought the coupon from Tix4tonight, $2 per person. Then you get either 25% off for lunch or 50% off for dinner. I went to the Dinner and only paid $17.49 before tax. Some highlights for the dinner, there are crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, short rib, and lamb from Mediterranean section. If you love Asian food, don't come here, because they don't have much variety and the food doesn't look delicious to me at all. Mexican section is pretty good. However, very limited choices for the salad bar and fruits. There are so many cupcakes at the desert section, if you love cupcakes, go for it! They also have cotton candy there which is cute! Anyways I think Spice Market meets my expectation very well, it is average buffet on the strip but price was good! I have had so many buffets at Vegas, the only memorable one is the Caesars Palace only because they have fresh oysters, but you are paying $32.99 for lunch and 40 sth for dinner! So people scale back your expectation for the spice market!
Came here with a Groupon and it was really awesome! All you can eat, all you can drink (beer, wine, champagne), and it was great! Plenty of variety (came for lunch). The dessert section was the biggest of any buffet Ive ever seen. Cotton candy too! Every time I went up to the buffet, I had a new beer waiting for me at the table. We wish we had gone back. Only reason for not giving 5 stars was it could have had a little more variety for the price and some stuff wasn't as fresh as other. Def. awesome buffet though!
Not every thing's good here of course, but again that's usually the case at most buffet places. I'm giving 5 stars based on just a couple dishes I had here that I really liked. . . Crab meat wrapped in sole (at the seafood section) is a MUST try! This alone is worth the money. It's so tender, moist and tasty. Shrimp pasta, potato skin, grilled zucchini are all very good. . . As to other stuff, it's ok to sample them, they're not particularly great in my opinion.. . I didn't know Groupon offers 50% discount for 2. Definitely check it out if you're going.
The worst buffet ever....not even worth the time or trouble to go down the escalator, let alone the money to pay for it.  The food was bland, Luke warm and the textures were challenging.
This buffet was the best one we went to with our 24 hour pass in Vegas. The buffet had a huge variety and all we had was fresh. On the weekends you can get free champaign during brunch...and they kept your glass filled! My favorite parts of this buffet were the Mediterranean and dessert sections. I had way too many desserts, but they were all worth every calorie!
Easily one of the best bang for your buck buffets and a classic of Las Vegas that will never disappoint. Sure, Spice Market buffet won't stack up against the big boys like Wynn Buffet or Wicked Spoon, but it provides an array of delicious foods from every corner of the world and wonderful desserts. The quality is certainly there. Spice Market has not disappointed me in 10 visits. There are TVs in one side of the dining area where you can watch sports. Included in Buffet of Buffets.
Part of the buffet of buffets promotion, this buffet is a slightly upgraded hometown buffet but if you go during peak hours, you will wait ~2hrs as we did for a party of 2. I would recommend passing on this location as all the meats were dry, they did not have enough people cleaning tables so that was the main reason there was a huge backup in the line, and overall the variety was above average but the quality was sub par. At least I didn't get food poisoning?
I cant believe we paid $30 each for this buffet.  So many soupy casseroles, dry meat, generally just tasteless food.  Went thru each station and could barely find anything that looked good.  Thank goodness for the cup cakes.  I filled up on those.  The pizza was not even good.  How can you screw that up.  Maybe the problem was that we went about 3:30.  Lunch just got over so all the food was probably left over from lunch.  Nothing was hot.  This was a recommendation from a local.  Sad disappointment and a waste of money.
I expect more from this buffet inside Planet Hollywood.  Unfortunately, I'm don't like buffets.  Quality is typically lacking and food sits in a bin where you have no clue how many hours it has been sitting there.  The buffet is large and laid out nicely.  The food actually looks good, so I had some hopes that it would be ok.  My issue is that the food was dry and tasted like it was sitting out there for a while.  My fear of buffet food was verified here.  Oh well.
I really liked it. Loved the cupcake variety. Food was fresh, kept hot, pleasant experience. There will be lines no matter what time you go. Staff is polite and attentive. Went here on a groupon- good wine and beer choices.
Line was extremely slow at 9:30 p.m. on a Thursday.  I'd have been more understanding if the two (more like 1 and 1/2) hosts had any sense of urgency to get people seated when there are open tables everywhere. It took 30 min to get seated. . . We also watched a table of people sit with food in front of them for a good 5 minutes but no silverware. When they finally asked we watched the guy spend a few minutes dealing with other tables and plate pickups before returning. . . On top of all of this the food was pretty terrible overall. I'm not hard to please and know what to expect from a strip buffet and this place was awful. . . On the plus side we did the "All you can drink" option and were served frequently by a nice waiter. The desserts were also quite good.. . I would only recommend this place to someone I secretly wanted to sabotage and would only return if it was free.
This is not the fanciest buffet in Vegas but it is one of our least expensive favorites.. Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino Spice Marked puts on a good spread at a reasonable price.  The food is good quality and average to good in taste.  The real star of Spice Market is the large variety of moist yummy cupcakes in the desert station.  There is at least a dozen varieties of cupcakes!  The soft serve ice cream is the same Custard type of ice cream served in the Paris buffet and it is simply my fav.. . There is also a Groupon currently available for two including "all you can drink" alcohol :)
I went to enjoy the buffet voted best in Las Vegas! I was disappointed in the customer service. From the start the cashier lady was telling me I had to pay tax I asked why she said that she could show me and attempted to grab something from the trash can. I was very angry with that! The food was decent but not fresh. The best was the salmon and bow tie noodles. I did enjoy dessert the crepe chef was polite friendly and was honestly the only part I enjoyed of the establishment. We had all you can drink wine our server came back with two full glasses of watered down white wine. I can say I been but never again!!!
This Buffet has definitely gone down hill.  We used to wait in line for 1 - 2 hours, but that was ok because the food was worth it.  Today, our seafood options were disappointingly limited; and it looks like most food was cooked hours ago.  They ran out of crab stuffed sole (and never refilled).  The chicken (American) was very dry.  Nothing exciting in the Mexican section.  Pizza was ok, but sub par for a brick oven style.  The only benefit is I had a groupon for buy one get one free.  If I am going to a Buffet (once/year) - then I would rather spend more money on better food.
It only gets 3 stars because we had a groupon. If I paid full price it would probably be two stars. The aria's buffet is far superior. . . However, I do want to say that desserts were delicious, contrary to some of these reviews talking about only the cotton candy and the cupcakes. They have expanded to other items that rank right up with the wynn's dessert concoctions.
The line to get into the buffet is usually very long. You wait in 3 different lines before you get seated.. . The food is decent. Nothing too top notch. They do have a good range of foods to goose from like seafood, mid-eastern, and Mexican.. . The best part is that you do get free drinks all night so it's a food place to eat an drink for a couple hours before continuing with your night.. . Check groupon for deals because the original price for the Buffett I not worth it. . . My server was Pablo, he's good people!
Good Prime Rib and Champagne, okay food for the price I guess.  The wait staff is very nice!
Oh i like this place! I bought a groupon so it came out real cheap. Anyways, the food was bomb. My favorite side was the italian and mid-eastern food. Be ready to wait in line and to eat a lot! The dessert bar looked like paradise! I think is the cheapest buffet on the strip but the food is real good. Is a must try place.
Are you kidding me!!  So you wait in line for over an hourto pay in a hot and stuffy line only to wait another half hour to be seated while gazing at multiple empty tables and tables covered in plates and glasses that haven't seen patrons for ages. . Finally seated, ready for a glass of unlimited champagne we paid for only to be told they are out of champagne! It's 8:00, not midnight, how are you out of champagne in Vegas? Food is okay, but not any better than other buffets. Really not sure how it got voted Best in Vegas.. If I could give it zero stars I would.
Argh not worth it. Just go to paris buffet. Yes the have fewer choices but it doesnt suck like the spice market.
