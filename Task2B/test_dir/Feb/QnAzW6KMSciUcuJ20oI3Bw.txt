Food was soo good.  The hot dog "snapped" when bitten into.  Te burger was juicy and the onion rings were crispy.
Fresh everything makes this a great stop to eat for the entire family. If the line up is long when you arrive, take a menu, chose your food and soon enough it will be your turn to order. As I eat "clean" I was worried that this looked like a fast food place and that I would not be able to find anything to eat. I was pleasantly surprised how much there was for me! The beet salad was delicious! Portions are plentiful and there is something for everyone. Well worth the wait!
This little jewel is not to be missed. Their food is fresh and tastes like what you wish you could have on family picnics and barbecues - simple, delicious, and filling! I had a hard time choosing something because I wanted everything they offered. I had a great time sharing plates with my friends and sighing after every bite (no joke). The food is the staple to a restaurant, but here at Joe's, the environment is as well. The decor is fresh and modern, yet feels completely unintruding. If it's nice outside, sit near the huge trees and then take a walk by the garden nearby. In general, this place is full of happy, and I felt like a kid eating at a banquet. My favorite part? It might sound a little weird, but the bathrooms are the coolest. Expect a few surprises when you walk inside.
I came here almost a year ago but never wrote a review. This place serves hot, fresh food. They grow the food on the land behind the restaurant. It was so good that I went back multiple times to try different items on the menu. It's a bit of a drive from Tempe but I think it's worth the drive.
the concept is great - farm to table, but I wasn't impressed. I think it's overrated, maybe because Guy Fieri visited there for Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, but what does he know? he wears his sunglasses on the back of his head. . Super long wait time and all of our food was cold. booooo
Gave them another try and whatever had gone wrong in the recent past has certainly been addressed. I tried the lamb burger which was absolutely delicious.  It NEEDS to be on the menu permanently!  My wife's farm burger was perfect.  The line was long, but you can't fault them for being popular.  Once we placed our order the food was ready promptly and was fresh and hot.
I got lucky because the Lamb Burger was a special. It was absolutely the best burger I have ever had in my entire life. The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly, but unlike a regular hamburger it had a lightness and savoriness that was unique. I had the side caesar salad which was just lathered with delicious caesar dressing. A bit too much dressing for me but still tasty. I also tried the garlic fries which smelled amazing and tasted even better. I do NOT eat onion rings, but I couldn't resist trying theirs and boy, they were awesome. Finally, my boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich which was worth the trip on it's own. Take the drive...it's well worth it!
I always enjoy dining at Joe's Farm Grill. The quality of ingredients is obvious. My personal favorites are the Fontina Burger and the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. The beef and chicken are flavorful and not dry. If the weather permits, eat outside. I do like eating indoors, but it's hard to find a seat sometimes, and the flies fly in every time someone opens the outside doors.
Good food, decent prices, the only low point is that u have to be ready to wait about 20-30 min until you can order the line is always super long. The upside to that is that the food is awesome.
What a waste of time!  Horrendous line on Saturday evening 2/15/2014, a few minutes over an hour standing outside then in a crowded lobby.  One order taker, and that's all there could be because there is only one window to order...another window where you pick up your food.  So, a long wait would possibly worth it if, and I mean IF, the food was good.  The Farm Burger was absolutely nothing to write home about.  5 Guys, Habit Burger and In and Out Burgers are dramatically better than Joe's Farm Burger.  The lamb burger was so rich, it caused my wife stomach distress for two days after.  The full rack of ribs was dry and the sauce was non-exceptional.  Garlic fries were garlicky, too much so and the onion rings were just onion rings, nothing new or better.  Sitting outside in the evening was chilly--they do not offer heat lamps.  Prices are on the high side, especially considering the quality of the food.  I have no idea at all why people wait in line for an hour or more to eat this food.  Just because Guy Fieri visited the place does not a great dining experience make.  Joe's Farm Grill is a phenomenon way past it's time.  Even if you live in Gilbert near the restaurant, you would be better served to find another hamburger or rib shack.
This place is delicious, period. Awesome atmosphere, great place to hang out outside. Fresh food from the farm. It's  no little pricey, but it's worth it if you can spend a little more on lunch, very reasonable compared to a lot of places that have really good food. It won't let you down. Go here and try it for yourself
Joes is overpriced and overrated. It's also not worth the ridiculously long line it ALWAYS has. I live across the street and the line is out the door for any regular meal time. Their food is fine, and the atmosphere is fun, but I don't feel it's worth the price or the wait. The best thing to get there is the breakfast. The prices for those are not too bad, and you get a ton of food. Pancakes rival cracker barrel. If you go on a weekday morning, the wait isn't too bad for breakfast.
I had been here once before and remember having a great burger. Wanted to go healthier this time so I ordered the Wild Salmon Plate (ok, not so healthy on the fries) and a Farm Salad to share with a friend. The salmon was delicious- perfectly cooked and seasoned. I upgraded to garlic fries. These also were seasoned perfectly- one of my new favorite places for garlic fries! The salad is large, fresh, and light with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette dressing (or your choice of several others). Overall a fantastic experience! . . -As a pregnant lady, it would be nice if there was more than two single-stall bathrooms...but not a huge deal.
This place has the best bbq chicken pizza and garlic fries! The only downfall is that it is so far away from Tempe. I have yet to find a better place to eat at a reasonable price. You must try it and I promise you won't regret it! Can't wait to see you again joe's farm grill!!!!
