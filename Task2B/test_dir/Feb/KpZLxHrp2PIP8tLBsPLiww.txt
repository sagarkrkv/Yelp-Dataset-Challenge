There isn't anything I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. Yes, it is amazing! Yes, it is beautiful! Yes, the staff are excellent!  This was our first time staying here and it definitely won't be our last. Thank you to everyone who works here for making our stay wonderful!!
Definitely not your "typical" Vegas hotel... More like the grand vacation clubs I'd say, if I had to make a comparison.. . Large rooms fit for a King (or queen), suites concept with a full furnished little kitchen.. Gorgeous bathroom, great view, free valet park, close to the monorail, and let's see the list goes on. . . Oh, there is no casino on the property. This place is similar to the Hilton grand Vacations complex with the difference that Signature is more central to the happenings of Las Vegas.
This condo/hotel is okay. Pros: each room has it's own balcony. Con: it's a far ass walk to MGM
Five stars all the way.. Easy to check in no long line at all.. Valet included with my stay if course.. Gates place rooms are huge with a full kitchen and a spa tub.. The staff are extremely nice here and my first at the MGM Signature .. I always stay at the MGM grand which is there parent and this surpass them.. And it connects to the MGM grand so walking to the casino is easy.. Love it
LOVE LOVE LOVE the Signature.  My husband and I have been coming to Vegas for 30 years.  We have stayed at all the really nice hotels on the Strip - The Signature tops them all!  We always try to reserve a Balcony Deluxe Suite (comparable in price to other high end rooms on the strip) in Tower One, on the strip side, on a high floor.  We love the balcony - There's nothing like turning the air conditioning off at midnight and opening the doors to your balcony and letting the desert breeze into the room.  Oh . . . and did I mention the jacuzzi tubs - so relaxing!  This is a "NON-SMOKING" hotel!    Yea!!!  Although there is no casino and I'm a moderate gambler, it's really no big deal as it is such a short distance on the moving walk way to the MGM casino.  In addition,  Signature guests can enjoy the MGM pools!  Have you ever seen the MGM pools and lazy River?  They are amazing!  If I can't stay here, I'm not going!!!!
Excellent stay for a week in Vegas. It's attached to MGM and a short walking distance from the Strip itself- but far enough away to avoid the smoke and obnoxious crowds. The deli in tower 2 is DELIGHTFUL!! Well worth the price! The Vegas Blvd breakfast sandwich- very good! The hotel is definitely worth the price. Customer service is EXCELLENT. The wait or valet, cab, or your bags was a bit longer then usual this time if year, but still acceptable. The rooms are luxurious to the regular folks: jacuzzi tube, fridge and kitchenette (which is not a standard in Vegas anymore, often you have to pay extra to get a fridge or microwave in your room), big bathroom, decent TV. Beautiful view of the strip. We were at the end of the hall, and it was dead quiet the entire time. Bed was decent, house keeping  excellent. We will stay here every time we visit Vegas from now on.
It's breaking my heart to give this hotel a two-star review.  This was probably my fifth staying at the Signature and it used to be my go-to place in Vegas.  I was so let down this time and let me tell you why:. . Online booking:. I never had any problem previously booking directly via the SignatureMGM website.  There were glitches three times in two weeks and my final booking wouldn't go through.  I called customer services and let them know the problem.  "We are sorry you are experiencing technical issues.  We will notify our IT dept. but there's nothing we can do at the moment."  Okay, fine.  Since I loved the Signature so much, I booked through Priceline.com and prepaid everything.. . Check-in:  . I arrived 9pm at night after five hours of traffic.  There was only one person at the front desk and she spent the longest time helping the guest before me.  There were other clerks walking around but no one would help me till 15 minutes later.  Not happy.. . Bell service:. I waited 45 minutes in my room for my luggage to be brought up.  I finally called and asked what happened.  The front desk person said, "sorry, the bell man came to your suite but the do-not-disturb light was on.  So he went back down."  I ran to my door, the light was not on at all!  Minutes later the luggage came.  The true story, "sorry, the guy that was here earlier went to the wrong suite."  Why do people lie?. . Room amenities:. There was no utensil in the drawers of kitchen or any toiletry items in the drawers of bathroom.  So I called again because I needed a martini shaker.  "No problem, we will bring one to you right away."  Minutes later, service guy showed up with a wine bottle opener.  After explanation, he went back and brought a real martini shaker.  Sigh.... . After staying here for so many times, these were NOT the normal quality of services experienced in the past.  Something is not right with the management.  I would hate to leave my favorite place from this point on.
Hands-down the best hotel experience I've had in Vegas.. . From the moment we stepped in to the hotel's Tower 3 building, we knew that this wasn't a typical 'Vegas' hotel. For starters, the lobby smelled like a Spa with fresh orchids on the front desk.. No casino. No obnoxious guests milling around with cigarettes and drinks. Just a very peaceful atmosphere. . . Every single member of staff was friendly and accommodating, but also discreet. The valet guys and women on the front desk were charming. Samples of peach champagne en route to our room.. No cleaning woman banging on your door at 9am.. Just perfect.. . The gym was moderately sized, clean and uncrowded, with modern well-maintained equipment. Loved the food at the cafe in Tower 3 - really fresh and made with care. Can highly recommend the roast beef sandwich!. . We absolutely loved our suite on floor 31. Fantastic views of the Strip. Great jacuzzi bath tub big enough for two, as well as a huge shower and separate toilet room. . One of comfiest hotel beds I've stayed in a long time!. . I can pretty much guarantee I'll be staying here again next time I head to Las Vegas...
This place is a little respite away from all the smoky casinos. It's quite, peaceful, spacious, clean and smoke free. The rooms are super spacious, including the bathroom. The gym is nice and not crowded. They have a starbucks and a nice little breakfast spot called DELIGHTS. If you want all the excitement of Vegas, this might not be the spot for you, but if you want a break from all the noise and smoke, this place is great. I did not go to the pool though...it was probably just all right, though. But again, not a lot of obnoxious crowds either. We had a  heck of a time booking with the concierge a group rate and I came into the situation having zero faith. So was more than pleasantly surprised to find just a great spot. (the guy in charge of group rates does not instill confidence...but I just was super persistant and detail oriented)
My stay at the Signature was pleasant. I enjoyed one of their junior suites for a few nights. The suite was spacious and had enough room to entertain friends before hitting the strip for the evening. It was clean, well kept, and had a comfortable bed. . . The bathroom had a whirlpool tub and a shower, both big enough for two. My only complaint about the bathroom were the products, just didn't get that clean feeling after using their soaps. . . The hotel is removed from the strip. No casino within the hotel, but there is a Starbucks. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the Signature towers to the food court and casino floor of the MGM. A cab ride from the Signature to most hotels on the strip is $10-$15. One thing to keep in mind during off hours there aren't a lot of taxis lines up waiting, it might take a few minutes for the valets to find one for you. . . The front desk staff, house keeping, and in room dining staff were attentive and friendly. If you don't need to be directly on the strip but still want to be close to the action, the Signature is a good spot. Also it's an MGM property so you can earn M life points during your stay.
