Holsteins will entice you to eat like it's your cheat day... here I had the BEST. BURGER. OF. MY. LIFE.  (THANK you local Yelper friends who graciously messaged me recommendations just b/c I was in town! XoXo!)  I'm not even a burger ho like my beloved hubby.  However, my meal (and my hubby's) embodied all of what I love about Vegas... it was sinfully delicious, with great service.  . . We were greeted with salt and vinegar pop corn and decided on:. . RED VELVET CAKE SHAKE. Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie. . NOM NOM BURGER  :::  (Best. Burger. Of. My. Life) ::: Perfection. Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing. . GOLD STANDARD. Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. . From start to finish, this was a perfect meal.  The ambiance was chic, the music and restaurant noise level were energetic, and Holstein's can easily accommodate bigger groups.  I hope all who visit have the same delicious experience.  ;o)
California Turkey Burger over greens with fresh jalapenos, sprouts, cucumber, tomatoes, and a side of ranch! Great burgers with tons of flavor and nice shakes too!  Check this place out when you're in town.
Great burgers! Awesome shakes! I'm not saying it's the best burger place in vegas but top 3! I recommend trying the steak burger! Great service and the strawberry milkshakes is amazing!
My husband is kicking himself for not coming here the last time we were in Vegas! The adult bamboozled milkshakes were a total hit! He went for the drunken monkey! The Oreo shake was also delish! . The golden standard burger has won best burger in Vegas and for good reason! Half pound, big enough to share with a friend. The fries were yummy as well. . The place is bigger than it looked to be from the outside and service was really good. . Be sure to check out the special after dinner treat: it's smoking cool!
Went for lunch, the Lobster Mac and Cheese app is excellent. Had the gold standard burger for $18, meh I have had better $5 burgers. Service was only average , looked to me like they were a bit understaffed. App, burger and iced tea for $36  overpriced.. . We are now being overrun with "gournet"burger places on the strip, for my tastes BLT burger is much better
We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Onions were great! Gold burger was perfect!
It's a sports bar at a swanky hotel. I would say Vegas casual :). . The service is great and they make sure you like your food.. . I recommend going for the pork tacos. They were delish!. . I got the chicken sandwich which I don't remember much about - so that should say something. . . Overall - if you need a good place to eat in the Cosmopolitan hotel - this is a good choice.
Adult milkshakes? Yes please! Turkey burger sliders? That too!! Onion rings and fries? Yes! LOL! . . This is a great place to go for foods and to get your night started whether you are clubbing or whatever you plan to do when in Vegas. It's also great for locals that want to enjoy an adult milkshake and a burger!! I recommend this place to everyone that comes and visits me!!!. . You can come here casually dressed or dressed in your club attire--no judgements ever been made when dining here! Trust, I've been to this restaurant both in casual wear after coming from a concert in the Boulevard Pool and in club attire heading to Marquee after dinner. . . I've tried the Birthday Cake milkshake which is just yum and a monkey one (can't remember the name for the life of me, but I want to say that it had bananas in it).  I'vetried the turkey burger sliders and the chicken sandwich. Both were like heaven in my mouth. Their fries and onion rings are great as well! . . I can't think of anything bad to say about this place! Whether you are visiting or a local like me, I highly recommend this place!!
I've been here a few times. Everything I've ever had here has been great except the crispy pork belly buns. I hate when I go somewhere with so much on the menu that sounds really good and I end up basically wasting an opportunity by choosing something that ends up sucking. I'd say I'm about 6-1 here including appetizers, not a bad record. 4 1/2 stars for the food, -1/2 star for the terrible pork belly buns, and -1 star for price, especially the shakes (they add an undetectable amount of booze, and double the price). Gourmet burgers=fancy bar food, and a lot of bars are stepping up their game these days while still keeping their prices reasonable., even a few places on the strip. Just because a restaurant is in the cosmopolitan, doesn't magically elevate their product to the next level. Cosmopolitan restaurants are like SEC speed (you won't understand this if you're not a college football fan), their superiority is just a myth. IMO, the food at Holsteins is overpriced. If this place was across the street at Planet Hollywood, it would be 30% cheaper (unless they put "Gordon Ramsey" in the title).
Favorite burger joint on earth.  Spiked milkshakes and burgers with top choice cuts of meat.. . I always come here at least once when in Vegas.  Try "The Rising Sun" just phenomenal.  The buffalo chicken dip is really good but it is simply too much food with the burger.  Don't upgrade on the regular fries... They are the best option.  . . Inside the Cosmopolitan located across from the Marquee.  STK is an awesome steak house inside Cosmo check that out as well.
Creative burger choices but overpriced. I got the Rising Sun. Delicious - you got the sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy flavors all in one burger but the burger itself was just not juicy enough. I love a juicy, messy burger. This one was on the dry side. And the fries? Soggy. Many were burnt. What a disappointment. You can't call yourself a great burger establishment if you can't do fries right. . . All in all, this place was good but not worth the price and did not live up to the hype.
Meh. It was okay. I was expecting an amazing burger, but what I got was kind of tough, over-handled meat and ingredients whose flavors didn't really stand out. My bf had the Gold Standard, it was anything but. One note flavor. Couldnt distinguish goat cheese from tomato confit. I had the Nom Nom, a basic burger with kobe beef. Got this because I wanted the meat to sing. It didn't.  Like I said, tough. We've had the Holstein experience. Not going back again.
This is in the Cosmo and well worth finding. Although, when we stumbled upon Holsteins and asked the host how the food was, he told us in a snotty tone, "Best burgers on the strip".  I had a burger that tasted like grandma's meatloaf with BBQ sauce- to die for.  The gigantic onion rings were fresh and awesome!  I have to say, we'd had a few adult beverages before we got there and took the leftovers to our room.  It was even better cold, the next morning!
This was the first meal i had in vegas when we arrived.  It was amazing! The options are awesome.  I actually got a turkey burger, i think it was called the california turkey burger.  I never eat turkey burgers but it sounded so good.  It was delicious! . . First off, this burger was huge! The bun was so perfect.  It was light, crispy and had a little bit of a sweet taste to it.  Delish! Everything was super fresh! The fries, I could have eaten at least 3 servings of them! The onion rings were super good also.  I wish i would have had a milkshake from there, they all sounded so good! . . My cousin got the El Machete (sp?) burger.  it was cooked perfectly!!!!After seeing that burger and how it was cooked, made me wish i would have gotten a beef burger, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from getting the turkey burger. . . we also had fried pickles which were delicious! The aioli sauce they came with was really good and creamy.  It had a different taste to it.  The pickles were super crispy and the batter was seasoned so well! Some times friend pickles can be super salty, but these ones were perfect and the batter didn't come off of them after you took a bite! . . I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, but delicious place to eat on the strip.
Kobe and Foie gras burger!!!??? After a lucky streak at the craps table, I felt like a billionaire so I figured YOLO, let's get a $28 "billionaire burger!". . I ended up splitting this with my buddy and also sharing the "gols standard" with the dry aged beef and goat cheese.. . I msut say, they were both delicious but very very different:. Billionaire:  The patty itself was made from Kobe and foie gras, then it was topped of with a seared slab of foie.  Taking a bite into it is sensory richness overload, effin delicious!  I immediately grabbed the Stella and washed it down and it was just heaven.  But pretty much, all yo get form this burger is the richness of fat.  I am glad I split it because I would not feel good after eating this one alone.  Great burger, would be willing to split it again with someone.. Gold Standard:  Now this is a burgerthat I thought had great balance and flavor.  The patty was delicious, definitely a great pronounced beef flavor.  The goat cheese and tomato confit was absolutely perfect in the burger.  This is a burger I would order again and eat on my own.. . Their fries, onion rings and wings are nothing to rave about.  They have a great beer selection, and the service we got was spot on excellent.. . This is one of the only reasons I would ever come back to the Cosmo (hotel sucks).
I had the most deee-licious burger here the other day.  I split a Fun-ghi burger with my friend and shared buffalo wings.  We knew the burger would be awesome just from it's aroma, but man, when I took my first bite, I was in burger heaven.  From the menu description, the Fun-ghi burger contains: Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, & Frisee.  We also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.The burger was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  The buffalo wings were very good too.  The fries were standard.  I so want to come back and try the Billionaire Burger and a shake!  The Billionaire Burger has kobe beef and foie gras, which we can't have anymore in CA.. . . As Seen on TV:. . Unique Eats. Aired on 07/22/2012. Episode: Las Vegas. Over the top desserts.
Literally, this place has the best burger I've eaten in my entire life. So good I went two days in a row. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas. . . Only problem, which I can't dock stars for nor would I, this place is only in Vegas. Please please please open up a restaurant in LA!
Amazing burgers! For something light but heavy enough to categorize as a burger, try the Urth Burger. For a meaty burger, go with the El Machete! Sweet potato fries are delicious, as are the onion rings. Must try the milkshakes, especially the Red Velvet Cake! Add the extra shot of alcohol for $5, it's worth it! They even give you the extras of the milkshake in a separate tin can, enough for two glasses. The popcorn appetizer is light and delicious. Service is fast, great staff, great atmosphere. Definitely recommended for viewing sporting events.
Came here at about 10pm on a Saturday night.  We each had one of the boozed shakes however mine wzs without the booze. I had a Grasshopper cookie and my boyfriend had the Cereal which was Captain Crunch flavor...it was actually good! Mine was good as well and I was able to take the left over that didn't fit in the glass into a to go cup. We sat right away at the bar which was a good idea because they were slammed and the wait for a table was probably pretty long.  Overall good place, I would like to go back and try the food.
Food: really good! Onion rings, burger, s'mores shake!! Pricey!. . Service: great!. . Atmosphere: looks great, but I hate being sat in the half booth right next to another table. Too close for comfort!. . Totally recommend. Get a reservation on open table. Cool place. We will definitely go back!
First off, i absolutely give this place 5 STARS! Their burgers and shakes are awesome!!. . This review goes to the next day, 02/10/14, ( yes we went two days in a row because it was that damn good!).  It was busier than the previous day, which is totally fine.  However, I am giving a couple of the waiters that "helped" us 1 star.  The hostess was awesome and sat us down right away.  After sitting there for ten minutes we were ready to order (i recommend the Rising Sun).  The waiter, this was around 5 pm, went to EACH table and assisted them.  Our menus were down and closed which is an indication that we were ready.  He did not even introduce himself or asked us if we wanted drinks...nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes assuming that he was going to get back to us after getting drinks for the other table.  Still nothing.  Only until the 3rd time he came backto our section did he notice us.  We're not those high maintenance couples that need acknowledgement every single time, but he didn't apologize for the wait or even introduce himself.  He just asked if we were ready.  Well, we're not in Denny's, we're paying $18 per burger plus other things so I do want decent service.   We didn't order, but asked to move to the front of the restaurant (to get better service there).  Of course, he said yes, but told us to grab our utensil and napkins....thanks guy for becoming even more of an ass.  I wish I knew his name, but like I said, he never introduced himself.. Moving to the front was a good choice because the waitress in the front was very kind and got our orders right away.  Also, the men in all black who bring out the food and drinks are very nice as well.  Our waitress was getting off work and said that Wendy will be taking over and that's when it went down hill AGAIN! She came over to introduce herself and told us that if we needed anything to ask her.  Well, I asked for some refills and she looked shocked at what I asked.  Maybe it was my imagination, who knows.  After about 20-30 minutes, we were about done eating.  She helped the new comers around us, but would always pass us.  We assumed that she was busy, so we let that go.  Finally she came and asked if we wanted desserts, but after burgers and shakes, it was enough.  We declined and she walked away.  This is where it became highly irritating (along with the first waiter). We declined on the desserts and our plates/glasses were empty, so that's an indication that we were done.  It's pretty common sense that we didn't want more and we would like the check.  We were waiting for about ANOTHER 20 minutes for nothing.  We saw her just standing there talking to her other coworkers.  I didn't know I had to raise my hand for help or go up to her for the check, which i didn't do.  Like I said, we are in an establishment where we were paying close to $80-$100 for two people and I am not going to walk to the register to pay.  She FINALLY came and asked if we wanted the check. (Yeah, we wanted our check 20 min ago.) . . I LOVE this place and awesome work to the other 2 waitresses who served us well.  The other two just need some improvements.
Love this place! One of my new fave restaurants in Vegas. The shakes and burgers are sooooo good! I tried the fun-ghi burger (portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, with gruyere cheese) and it was amazing. Service was great too! Definitely must try if you love a good burger and alcoholic shake.
Came here on what seemed to be an uneventful and random Tuesday night with another guest. We luckily snagged a dining area right up front from the hostess stand while the other current diners were just leaving. Apparently the restaurant was packed and quite eventful despite our feelings otherwise.. . The table was still full of food, given the fact we were offered the only available seating at the time, but service was very quick to remove and set up for us promptly. . . We decided on the Fun-Ghi burger & the crispy pork belly buns. For desert, we were recommend the Tiramisu shake based on our preference of chocolate. We even got it to go and non-alcoholic. Everything came out surprisingly fast. *The menu is quite extensive so there are many choices for everything. Look online in advance or take a look on the menu outside.. . The Fun-ghi was delicious, but I really was expecting more from a 17$ burger. Truffle marinated Portabella mushroom, caramelized onions, frisee, and mayo with a beef patty. Rich and pleasantly mild despite the idea of alluring funky-nees from the truffle and gruyere. Ordered with sweet potatoes fries that were executed perfectly, although they only came with your normal and boring grocery ketchup rather than a unique dipping sauce or aioli that most burger places in its caliber of category offer.. . The Crispy Pork Belly buns were such a disappointment. So unpleasantly sweet, as if the pork itself were candied. And to add insult to the matter, the herbs or greens accompanied did not compliment the dish what so ever and gave it a medicinal and rather off putting taste. Terrible really.. . Shake was great but not anything special, and again, for the price of 13+?. . The service from our waitress could not have been any better. So polite and friendly and frequently checked back on us despite a full house; Impressive. I also believe the owner stopped by at one point and asked us how we were and carried on by removing some trash from our table.. . It's the questionable prices and the food quality that contributed to the 3 stars. I understand the atmosphere is apart of the experience (beautiful artsy and urban decor, obviously located in the upscale  and modern cosmopolitan) and leads way into the pricing, but it's quite unnecessary and confusing when the food isn't as up to par. I will be back to try some other burgers, but not planning on it anytime soon.
This place is awesome all the way around.. Of course, you have to wait an hr for a table most of the time, but the food is fantastic.. . The place is decorated with amazing art from Juan Muniz. So just the look of the place is already amazing.. . The flavor of the food as well as the presentation and creativity are remarkable.. . They also have a stupidly large beer menu! WHAT? LOVE! . My favorite thing are the shakes. OMG THE SHAKES! There are ridiculous! Vodka and Captain' Crunch? Sure! Whipped cream Vodka and Pop Rocks? Why not!?. . They have a ridiculous selection of burgers and they also have tons of things for us herbivores.. . This place is a absolutely a most at the Cosmopolitan.
My gf & I ordered their strawberry milkshake, truffle lobster mac&cheese, mexican car bombs and gold standard burger. The gold standard burger tasted like any other burger that you get from a restaurant. Nothing too special in my opinion. The mac&cheese tasted a bit bland to me. The mexican car bomb was ok. They gave you 4 pieces and the bacon wrapped peppers are stuffed with cheese & corn. Sad to say, I felt like the strawberry milkshake was the highlight of the meal! . Service was excellent! . Enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. Love the cartoon drawings of the cows hehehe :). Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again if I was in Vegas but i do recommend that to try it once while in Vegas!
After driving 6  1/2 hours vs the usual less than 4 to vegas, we were too tired to drive to Bachi, so we decided to try Holsteins. Besides H, another couple joined us for dinner. . 1. H had the Billionaire Burger (Kobe with foie gras), disappointment. Foie gras was wayyy overcooked and hard, we couldn't taste any of the port onion marmalade nor the truffle mayo that's supposed to be part of it. I will pay $15, not $32 for it.. 2. I had the Big Fat Greek (lamb burger). It was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty. The olive relish was almost as thick as the burger, wtheck!. 3. Male friend ordered the Rising Sun(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal. Soo yummy, but I think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it. :\. 4. My 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice. Maine lobster roll for $16.50. The two rolls were COLD, and they were not rolls, at least not where I came from haha.Those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks. Two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'. Wtheck!. . Our server Adam never cracked a smile. I can't say the service was bad, but just very basic. I also didn't like the fact that he took our dessert menus away for the table next to us without asking first. i wasn't done yet! So we didn't order any. I would like to leave a 10% tip but given that we were with another couple (haha), I reluctantly added 15% :P. . Won't be back because it's not yummy.
One of my favorite burger & shake joints on the strip.. . Being Canadian with our ridiculous food safety laws, this is my goto place on the strip for a medium rare burger. Massive menu with every option you can think of. . . Huge fan of the chocolate shakes as well. . . Great place for a hangover cure meal or Vegas pregame. . . Tip: I've always sat at the bar with the friendly staff and monsterous TVs.
Came here for lunch and was pretty impressed. First of all, the Cosmo is an awesome, very chic hotel and I can't wait to come back to visit. . . The menu is pretty big at Holsteins and has enough options for any eater to be satisfied. I ordered a salad with grilled salmon and made some modifications to it (changed the cheese, dressing on the side) and surprisingly it came out exactly the way I wanted it! Also, they gave me a generous piece of salmon on top so I was happy with that. My boyfriend had the gold standard burger and loved it--he literally talked about it for the next 2 days.  I also had a Bloody Mary which was delicious-one of the best I've had---the only negative was it was pretty small bc the glass was overflowing with ice. . Food is very good, service was ehhhh--our waitress was ditzy, but again the food came out correct so nothing to really complain about! Definitely worth a stop if you are in he Cosmo.
Great burgers.  Good meat.  Good buns.  Good appetizers.  Good onion rings.. . Terrible complimentary popcorn.. . Similar to Hoppdoddy's in Austin, Tx but not quite as good and I don't know that ingredients are local or organic.
One of the best Vegas restaurants I went to during my stay. I got a veggie burger, which was a fried coquette-like patty. Really delicious. They had complimentary spiced popcorn that I devoured. Our server was a really nice bro who made us feel welcome. Great comfortable booths too.
Had the Farm House burger and it was the best burger of my life! Didn't have a chance to have a shake since we had to head to the airport but definitely will next time.
The burger selection here is amazing.  I do think it can get pricey depending on how much you order or what you order. . . I tried the steakhouse burger with blue cheese and it was heaven in my mouth! I absolutely loved the flavors and it's probably one of the best burgers I've had thus far. One thing I would like to suggest is for them to be about to customize your burger more. Adding a protein style option with no bread, or option to make burgers in to salads.  I definitely would take a lot of the burgers and turn them in to salad. Saves me from filling up on the bread.
Loved the sunrise burger...the meat is amazing!!!
Amazing burgers.   The meat is just that good and the various styles are are creative and have unique flavors.   I got the rising sun and added a fried egg.  The teriyaki glaze was delicious without being to sweet.  The only thing i would do next time is get it bunless as the burger is huge and the bread really fills you up.. . I also got the milkshake the s'mores marshmallow one and the grasshopper mint one.   Didn't care much for the grasshopper one because the mix of alcohol and mint flavor was sort of weird.   The s'mores one was delicious.. . Next time i come here i would get a burger bunless and pass on the milkshake.   The milkshake is delicious but really fills you up and makes you not enjoy your food as much.
As a local I can give you the inside scoop on how these casino/resort restaurants work:. . 1. A talented chef designs the menu and recipes.. 2. The restaurant serves amazing food for a short time.. 3. Accountants find ways to cut cost.. 4. The food goes downhill.. . Sadly, such is the way with Holstein's.  . . The first time I ate here the burgers knocked my socks off.  The second time, I wished I had just gone to Applebee's.  It's easier to park at Applebee's, the food comes out faster, it's cheaper, and THE FOOD IS BETTER!. . The saddest part: the resort restaurants keep getting away with this.. . That is all I have to say.
Pretty good burger joint. It's good if you're in a rush, not dressed up enough for fancy dinner or just want a quick meal. We were seated right away and our waiter was wonderful, very nice, very attentive. We split the lamb burger and the gold standard burger. Lamb was ok. The gold standard burger was great. Onion rings and fries average. Milk shake awesome. 2 burgers 1 milkshake 1 diet coke came to $55.67 before tip.....but that's Vegas!
Monster burgers that taste great. Awesome service and even good with kids.  I will visit again.
