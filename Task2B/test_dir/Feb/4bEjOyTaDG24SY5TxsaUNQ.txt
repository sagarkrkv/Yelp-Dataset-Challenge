Mon Ami Gabi is my "go-to" restaurant for special brunch dates, when family is in town, and when I'm wanting a good steak! Since I'm local in Las Vegas it would be rare to find me in the heart of the strip but this restaurant has the best ambiance on a warm summer day, great service, and amazing brunch selections.
Love this place! Had breakfast twice on the same weekend. The food was really good. I had the ham and cheese crepe, delicious! My husband got the egg white and turkey omelet! He loved it. They do their own bread! Sat outside, highly recommend it!
Best steak I've ever had. The goat cheese appetizer is a must. It's all to die for. Our server was just as phenomenal as the food. Will be back
We were between a 3 and 4 on this place. The food, service and ambiance were all nice.. better than a 3 but not quite a 4. We decided to go higher because there was a make your own bloody mary bar which added to the fun of the restaurant. There was also a long line when we got there arewere seated quickly without a reservation. I'd come back.
Wonderful food selections.  Server was very nice and friendly.  Food was very good and arrived within a short time after ordering.
Although the food is not out of this world amazing at Mon Ami Gabi on the strip - the location and price more than make up for it. . . It's right opposite the Belaggio fountains and if you're lucky and ask for a table near the windows you can see the show every 15 minutes as you eat which is pretty amazing. . . We had the steaks and fries - which were ok. The steak is a very thin, long cut so it's not the most tasty but it's filling. The fries are slightly odd - they are more like shavings of a potato, or I'm afraid reminded me a bit of old toenails! But again lots of them and fill you up. . . To be honest compared to some of the places in Vegas and the prices you pay if you're looking for a nice atmosphere, central location and a good feed then you cant go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi.
over 3000 reviews and a full 4 stars.  i was expecting good.  what i got was borderline mediocre and whatevs.  it started with our server who was more interested in the table of middle aged women next to ours decked out in gucchi from head to toe.  straight up housewives of las vegas status.  whatevers, i'm not hating on the women, as much as i am on our server.. . he came to our table, introduced himself and said he'd be right back to tell us about the specials.  he did not return for another 10-15 minutes.  strike 1.. . we ordered a variety of items.  i got the chicken and apples sandwich which was delicious.  the fries on the other hand.  meh.  . . corn beef hash - he said the eggs would come out poached.  they did not.  it was fried.. . full order of mussels.  i found it a little fishy, but gf's said it was good. . . salmon salad.  what a sad, sad salad.. . it took us about 20 minutes to get our check even after we had finished our meal because our server was busy talking to the ladies and showing old photos from when he was young.  he then proceeded to go to a new table, use the same line he used on us, and then walked away even after seeing we were done.. . i think we were visibly annoyed, but if he caught on he showed no signs.  just went right back to chit chatting with everyone else.  first time ever where i have only tipped 10% on a meal.
The wife and I were invited to join another couple for Sunday brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was late morning on a beautiful, clear, sunny January day.  It was so nice on this particular day; we knew it would be a shame to not eat outside on Mon Ami Gabi's patio overlooking the Strip across from the Bellagio.  We didn't have reservations, not that it would've helped, since outside dining was first come, first served.  As luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed Strip-side view of passersby.  Needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the Strip.  . . We started off by sharing orders of the Housemade Country Pate ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  The portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  The cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  The wife and I split orders of the Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich ($12.95) and the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche ($13.95).  The grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  It was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  The quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  The amount of food was plentiful for the price.   . . For a national chain restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in Northern Virginia.  Mon Ami Gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  If you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!
If breakfast was this good, I can't wait to try dinner! Lets start with the cappucino. The huge huge huge cappucino! It was perfect. Not burnt, served in a bowl, yes a bowl! and very tasty. One of the best I have had outside of Italy! Then the Croque Monsieurr. So delicious. The breakfast potatos were fantastic as well. Great service, amazing view of the strip. I am not really a breakfast person so for me to be impressed at breakfast is saying a lot! This was not a place that was really on my list of must tries and now it is. My next trip this will be a dinner reservation for sure!
Great breakfast on the strip.  No idea about anything else. Wait staff is hit or miss, but a pretty cool place to people watch.  Standard strip prices.
Great place.  I had the scallops which were cook perfectly and my wife had the trout which was overcooked.  She did mention this to the waiter who just shrugged it off.  We weren't expecting a refund but an acknowledgment that he would pass the comment to the chef.
Great location, great food, great service, reasonable price.  Evening reservation on the patio allowed us to watch the fountains across the street at the Bellagio. Chateauneuf-de-Pape available by the glass was a nice plus.  We went through salad, appetizers, main dish, and deserts and they were all top notch.   Even our 4 year old had a great kids meal.
This is hands down one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas. First off if you love French Onion Soup than congrats you just founds the best in the country. I would literally fly to Las Vegas just to get the soup again. The fish is always fresh and delicious and of course the waitstaff is wonderful. If you can sit outside I'd recommend it, because you get a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. One down note is that they only take reservations for inside seating which I find strange considering outside seating is more popular. Otherwise though this place has 5 stars from top to bottom
The food was very good. I had the skate wig and beet salad and i was very happy with both. The tables were a little to close for comfort.
Horrible customer service. Do not bring a large group. The salesperson that "helped" me in advance did nothing at all for me but cause frustration. The management doesn't care if you want to give them business, so my advice is don't. I arrange group dinners and meetings for my company and I know where I'll never bring them again when we're meeting in Vegas.. . Food was eh, nothing amazing that would make me change my mind about the poor customer service.
my favorite
I'll start by saying that I'm the kind of person that likes variety, but this place was so good and well-priced that I found myself there on two consecutive nights recently.  First of all, you can request to sit in their large windowed room or on their patio in order to view the spectacle that is the Bellagio water show.  At night the show is very beautiful, and contrasts well with the soft candelight and ambiance of the dining room.. . Concerning the food, I started with the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  Everyone at my table thought this was beyond good.  They serve it with a crispy garlic bread, and the portion is rather large so you'll want to share with a few other people if you can.  For my main dish I chose the pan seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and tender with a sweet puree sauce.  I also made sure to try my friend's filet mignon with merlot butter sauce and it was DELICIOUS.  It came out to be about two inches thick, and really was a beautiful piece of meat which was well complemented by the crispy texture of the pommes frites.  If you try combining the scallops with the filet into a surf-and-turf kind of heaven, you won't be disappointed.. . For dessert we tried several of their varieties.  By far the best was the white chocolate bread pudding.  It was rich and delicious, without the gummy texture that some poorly cooked bread pudding tends to take on.  I specifically ordered the lemon tart, which was combined with some sour cherry concoction and was truly delicious.  If you like your dessert a bit tart, I would definitely recommend this.  The chocolate flourless cake was really good too, and came with a delicious ice cream.  . . My only complaint, which is probably a matter of personal preference, is that I found the french onion soup just okay.  It was a bit too sweet for me, and I would have liked the bread to retain some of it's crunch.  Other than that, everything else was delicious!
Do not get breakfast here. Maybe other meals ok.  Burnt toast & hashbrowns served cold.  People who think this is wonderful must eat at Denny's.
Just returned here after a business trip. Stayed at Paris so had no reason not to go here due to it's convenience. Well, we wound up eating here three times because it was so good. I have been here before and didn't remember it to be as delicious, but we had breakfast here twice and lunch once. My husband (this totally shocked me) thought the service and ambience was better than at Del Friscos. Cudos to Nicole and Peter, our servers who were great. It is lovely to eat outside and people watch.
This is the third time that I came, so I'm giving a combined review of the restaurant. . . I tried the warm Brie appetizer, good but not great. The steak is good, but had better elsewhere. Scallop appetizer was something memorable for me. Dessert was nothing memorable. The views are good if u sit at patio.
Very good food   Try the croque Monsieur    Very good sandwich.  Seating outside is awesome.   Best place to eat at the Paris hotel.   Service was great
Food was great, location is among the best in Vegas, but service and beer quality barely gets a 2 star.. . Lots of attitude by the waiters and waitresses when asked for simple things like forks or towels. As much as I have to be objective and give this place a 4 star rating because of the chef's work, I have to say I will probably not return here in the future.
Solid place in a great location. Great food for the price compared to all the other overpriced vegas restaraunts
Perfect food, perfect location. Mon Ami Gabi was an amazing dining experience. It's located in the Paris casino on the Vegas Strip. It is a must that you define al fresco here.. My friends took me here for my birthday, and it did not disappoint.. The bread was placed on our table in a bag, similar to a baguette bag. It was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The butter was sweet and spreadable and creamy, that had to be handmade on site. It was so good.. We started off with a full carafe of frangria, their twist on sangria, which was a wonderful  blend of fruit and alcohol. Not too sweet, but not overpowered by alcohol.. For starters we had the duck leg confit, this was the star of the meal. It came with sweet onions and lentils. Fall off the bone tender.. Entrees, 2 of us had the scallops, one had steak frites and the other had the roasted chicken.. The scallops, 4 large, were served with a side of sauteed mushrooms on a bed of sweet potato puree. Absolutely delicious, I couldnt finish mine. The scallops were perfectly tender and flavorful.. The steak was a perfect medium rare and my friend asked for green beans instead of fries, which they were fine with. According to her, the meal was one of the best she has ever had.. My other friend had the chicken, which was served with garlic mashed potatoes. Here too, the chicked was succulent and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were amazing.. For desert we had coffee and shared the pecan chocolate bar with a dollop of creme fraiche. It tasted like a fancy turtle. So delicious. The crust was this perfect biscuit/wafer.. Mon Ami Gabi is located right across from the Bellagio, which has a fountain show every night. So stunningly beautiful.. Our waitress Sarah was very attentive and she never hovered. She took a few snaps for us with the fountain show as background.. Overall the best dining experience ever!
My girlfriend and I visited Las Vegas for vacation and went to some amazing restaurants.  We tasted food that blew our minds and had experiences we will remember for a lifetime.  Mon Ami Gabi, however, was one of the most memorable.  Our waiter, Jose was FANTASTIC!  He immediately let us know that he was there to make us comfortable and recommended dishes based on friendly conversation.  He checked in constantly and made us laugh.  He was kind, patient and attentive.  The man loves his job and his passion for world-class service shows in every detail.  If you get a chance to visit Mon Ami Gabi, enjoy the food, take in the view, but GO FOR THE JOSE!
I ordered the butternut squash spinach salad and it was tossed really well. The spinach gave it a sweet nutty taste I love. We waited to sit outdoors for the fountain show and it was well worth it. The view is amazing.
Not as expensive as I thought! I went there on off days, as a local. Yummy lunch and front seat for people watching and fountain watching. Great service. Sat there extra long for the expresso.
I have been to Mon Ami Gabi a total of 3 times including my last review. Two of the visits have been very good, one was not so amazing. The last time I went was last weekend and it was very good. A friend and I went for breakfast but once I got there I was really craving a burger...so I got a cheeseburger with brie and an over medium egg...that counts as breakfast, right? (Now I'm kind of kicking myself because reading my last review, they had the same special for benedict...ooooph). The coffee continues to be good, they use Intelligentsia, so it is consistent with other tasty coffee places. Let me say that the burger was super delicious and large (and i totally ate the whole thing....yum), BUT it was not cooked correctly...ordered medium, served well done. I didn't really mind, but to be technical, it was incorrect. The egg was cooked correctly. The whole thing was really very tasty. The frites that came with it were not so awesome... a little too thin, they were kind of the texture of pork rinds. Regardless, for 15$ I would certainly get it again.... I will be back.
amazing food but book ahead, really long wait for a table otherwise
Always great but Valentines dinner was fabulous!  Great pate and chicken pail lard cooked to perfection!  Gluten free options galore!! Even GF Bread to enjoy with my pate....how nice that they accommodate all kinds of allergies! . Always fun and great people watching...good prices for outstanding fare!. Not to be missed...also outdoor and indoor seating...feels like Paris..,
Great ambience, patio seating is worth the wait.  Been here many times and love it.  Great for people watching (so French) and viewing the Bellagio fountains (so Vegas). I take all of my out of town friends here. Service is excellent.  . . What's best: . -Steak frites classique or the one with caramelized onions. -Baguette and butter. -Warm Brie. -French onion soup. -pate. . What you can pass on:. -Butternut squash quiche. . Tips:. -Arrive 30 minutes before your friends arrive to put your name down for patio seating.  There's always a wait for patio seating.. -From the parking structure, walk into the casino but stay to the right (keeping the tables to your left), past Gordon Ramsey's Steak and past the Eiffel Tower tickets line. Mon Ami Gabi is towards the front of the Paris Casino and Hotel near the valet.. -Patio seating is the best view for the Bellagio fountains show. Best when viewed in the evening.. -Bring sunglasses for daytime patio seating. -Reservations are only for indoor seating.  PATIO SEATING is waiting only!
Super romantic location with the best view on the strip!
We are members of the Lettuce Entertain You rewards club, so we come here at least 4 times a year,even though it is a half hour drive from our house. The filet with merlot butter/ red wine reduction sauce is my favorite item on the menu. Each steak come with the most delicious tiny little French fries (frites) and you will eat every last bite of them. The last two times we were there (my birthday and valentines day) we had the same server, Demetri, and he clearly loves his job! We never feel like we are a burden on the wait staff, they enjoy working at their restaurant just as much as we do dining there. My one and only complaint is that the valet at Paris is usually full and if you have to park in the garage you need to give yourself 10 extra minutes to get to your reservation on time. I guess that's called a "first world problem". Oh well.
This place was over hyped. ... breakfast was not worth the price! Its a very nice atmosphere ... good view of the strip and thats about it.
From 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:. . Food - 3. Service - 4. View/Scenery - 5. Price - 2. . Food was good.  I got the eggs benedict.  If you get a table with a view of the bellagio fountains, then it's probably the most awesome place to eat at on the strip.  Wish I could have tried more food.
The view. . The food. . The Service. . All great. . What else do you want in Vegas!!. . Had breakfast... Eggs Benedict, Salmon bagel well worth. . Had Lunch: awesome Sandwich Sangria...fresh. . Service was fast always, plenty of aids
One of my favorites...just can't beat the delicious food and the gorgeous views.
I have eaten here twice.  First time was ok, and second time was just bad.   Service was ok, not impressed.  I don't recommend this restaurant. More of a tourist trap than fine dining.
Dinner at Mon Ami Gabi was good... nothing spectacular, but good.. . We told the hostess our party was all here, but then two of our group wandered off by the time the buzzer was called, and she was NOT happy when we sat down with 2 missing people from the group. She rolled her eyes at us, which was a little uncalled for.. . Besides that, the servers were great, and the food was good. The appetizers were our favorites--the baked brie and warm goat cheese/marinara dip were AMAZING. I could have licked the plates! My steak was fine... a little overcooked, but fine. I also tried the scallops which weren't memorable.
I went here for a valentines date and not only was our food delicious, but the service was impeccable. Our server, Sharon V was on top of everything and Jossy never let our glasses go empty. Gabtini cocktails are to die for! Perfect food and service made our evening flawless. Worth every penny!
This review may be lost in the sea of the thousands of reviews already on here, but I must share my experience here..  I made reservations for valentines day at 7:45pm, well we left late and the traffic was horrendous of course, valentines on a Friday on the strip! Needless to say we arrived almost 45 minutes late. But they still honored our reservation!! and we only had to wait maybe 15 minutes for a table. Considering our tardiness and how busy they were, that was great!. And on another note,. The food was on point, we had fillet mignon and the hanger steak. Both delicious!! I had the Frangria, for $7. Not bad at all!! I can't wait to return for brunch on a normal day.
One of my new favorite spots in Las Vegas. Amazing views of the bellagio fountains outside and comfortable ambiance inside.  Best prime rib sandwich I've had in my life.
Excellent outdoor dining and top service! Love the steak aupoivre and the delicious greens. This is now my favorite restaurant on the strip!
I've heard GREAT things about their steak but unfortunately, i came for brunch. Brunch here is not bad, there's an outdoor patio to enjoy some sunlight and the inside looks rather fancy - for brunch, but i am not complaining. We were seated quickly but then again we came at 1 ish. Servers were really nice. The place smelled amazing. Everyone's dishes looked so appetizing. I split a mushroom omelette - big mistake, the portions here are not as big as Hash House lol so definitely coulda finished this on my own. The mushroom omelette was pretty good. Usually not a fan of mushroom but it went well with the chives and cheese. My friend ordered the chicken brie and apple crepe - which was also pretty good. I love chicken and it wasn't dry. Next time that's probably what I'm going to order. Actually, I really wanna try this "melt in your mouth" steak my friend has been raving about. She said it was the best steak she ever had. until next time !
The view and the food was amazing. . . We had brunch. . . Make a reservation, you will be seated quick. . . without reservation, the wait can be an hour.
great view of the bellagio waterfront. . had a brunch here, and the food was excellent.. great service!
This place was awesome. We went to a fancy pants steak house the night before and the meal was triple the price and this place was 100 times better. It is reasonably priced and ifyou can get a seat outside you get to see the water show across the street. I will always go here when in Vegas.
Excellent food! Great service! Awesome brunch.
This is a beautiful restaurant with delicious  food. It  has a casual vibe to it, although many people are well dressed. I prefer to go for lunch, when it is less crowded and the prices are lower.  My favorite dish is an appetizer of scallops.
I wish I could eat at Mon Ami Gabi every day! I absolutely adore food, service and atmosphere there.
Delicious spot! My wife and me came here for our expensive dinner out for our trip to Vegas. Food was yummy! Prices were pretty expensive but my wife got to see water show at the Bellagio from our table so we were happy with that.
Very nice and delicious!
4.5*. . There's no line on a weekday around lunchtime! Made a reservation but there was plenty of outdoor seating :) I felt so lucky. . . I have only eaten here once but am tempted to bump it up to a 5* should my next dining experience be as great. Quiche Lorraine was average but the chicken & brie sandwich was EXCELLENT! Yum. We also saw the Bellagio fountain show.. . Can't wait to go back to try some of their waffles & crepes for breakfast as well as the steaks for dinner. A must try in Vegas.
I really, really love this place--it seems like I come here for brunch every time I'm in Vegas. The make-your-own-Bloody Mary bar is a highlight when it's offered, but otherwise the cocktail list is very good, and the food is delicious. I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy.. . The only issue I've ever encountered here is that it can be very crowded and very busy; there are occasional moments where it is difficult to flag down your server (thus my star deduction)--in particular, the server mutilated the split check we requested, charging me a couple of pennies while my friend was charged the balance, and it took nearly five minutes to get his attention after we discovered the error (he promptly fixed it, though, and was extremely apologetic).. . An important note: Reservations are not possible if you want to eat on the outdoor terrace patio thing--you just have to stand in line and wait. However, I feel like the patio is overrated, since it can be quite hot and you'll be just inches away from drunk people who are smoking/screaming/doing whatever. Really--truly--eating outside on the Las Vegas Strip is not worth the wait or the grief. Believe me. Don't be a noob. Do yourself a huge favor and just eat inside where there is sweet, sweet air conditioning--you can make yourself a reservation online on OpenTable.com and bypass the line.
This place was a pleasant surprise. I thought it would be like the rest of the restaurants on the strip that rely on their location and don't have very appetizing food, I had the steak and frites which was very tasty. Their patio was a lot of fun with great people watching . I guess it helps it was sunny and 75 degrees today in Las Vegas. I would go back and recommend this place.
An absolute oasis in a sea of Vegas chaos. Great food and service along with a fantastic replication of a French brasserie.  Now I wish they had locations in Southern California.
Good:. Bread. Atmosphere. Many authentic French menu items. Wine selection. . Bad:. Steak Frites - medium grade meat - weak sauces. Weak cheeses
This place has NEVER done me wrong! Best bistro in town. Gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountain and the hustle and bustle of the strip. They have an amazing wine list, and make FRICKIN amazing French martinis.
Loved the chicken =] very good
Can they brunch or what!. . My friend and I were part of the VIP group for SPG and TotalRewards.  We were treated to a complimentary brunch at this restaurant right on the Las Vegas strip!. . It was a seat-yourself event where any table left open was yours for the taking.  The tables were already prepared with a delicious cantaloupe bowl of fruit with sides of brown sugar and mint syrup and a plate of salmon.. . The entrees were fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bananas foster french toast - with just the right amount of creamy goodness!  My friend enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, which we read they were known for.. . I don't even know what to say about the delicious chocolate mousse.  I mean really - it was melt in your mouth chocolate with the addition of what tasted like the chocolate crunches in ice cream cake formulated into a little ball and served over the mousse.  Texture perfection.. . The mimosas served were also quite large - I mean, hey, it's Vegas.... . . Service was great.  Very polite and accommodating for a large group event.
great location for people watching and seeing the water show across at the Bellagio. Great waiter. Helped us pick out favorites from the menu. Will make it a point to return to this place when in Vegas.
My boyfriend reserved this place for my birthday, and it was really a good choice! I love their daily soup and mussel! The light and candle was very romantic, but it was too dark to take a picture. Overall, I love this place.
This place has a great location along the sidewalks of Paris. I've heard great things about the food, and was able to work in a visit for breakfast one morning. I made a reservation on OpenTable and we were seated in a semi-outdoor area. The coveted spot in this restaurant is the outdoor patio, but they also have a room next to the patio with glass windows all around it. It was great to be inside while enjoying the views outside. I ordered the Big Skinny Pancakes, which were actually crepes. Amazing. It came with a side of fresh whipped cream. I also had a latte, which was delicious, but had I known it was Intelligentsia I would have ordered a regular coffee. On my next visit to Vegas I'll have to come back for lunch or dinner to try the onion soup au gratin.
Always a good bet.
3 stars because although it was good, there was nothing phenomenal about it.  Steak frites were so and so; scallops, bread, view and service were great.  Reasonable prices and not a terribly long wait, so I can't complain... But I can't rave either.  Decent, good, worth a visit, nothing special.
Great place, great service.. Food was ok but better than most places i have tried!
Delicious! If you want amazing french food-- go here! Worth the wait to sit outside! Great views of the Bellagio water show!!
This place was AMAZING and one of my favorite Yelp finds.  Made reservations on Yelp, and was seated within seconds of coming in.  The restaurant was pretty busy, but we were seated in a little corner with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were greeted with water, and a whole loaf of complimentary bread and butter - Yum!  . . Our server was incredibly helpful, and didn't disappoint the Vegas theme of hospitality.  We started with the mussels - so delicious!  I'm a sucker for mussels in wine and butter sauce, especially when we have bread to dip in the sauce!  My mother had the hanger steak which was perfect in a semi-sweet glaze.  I had the filet mignon in merlot sauce which was amazing!  Every bite melted in my mouth like a perfectly cooked medium-well steak should.  Our server suggested the Beaujolais wine to pair with my steak - and it was indeed a perfect match!  I've never had fries with steak, but the frites that the steaks came with were equally delicious.  . . I'm so glad this place exists, and will definitely be coming back!  Price wise, this place is definitely a steal for the quality of food, service and ambience that you get!
Came here for a nice romantic lunch with my girlfriend. The menu is very french, but also has some great seafood options.. . I had a lobster roll, while my girlfriend ordered an omelet. the omelet was less than terrific, but the lobster roll...mmmmm....my mouth just started watering even though I ate it over 2 weeks ago. . . great wine and cocktail selection, along with a bloody mary bar during brunch.
Sofia is the best hostess there! Such a beautiful view and their food is amazing! Try the goat cheese dip, I didn't think I even liked goat cheese but I couldn't stop eating it!
A friend raved about this place so we came here on our most recent trip to give it a try. I give it to them that they have the best location! From the outside seating you can get a perfect view of the strip and Bellagio's fountain show. However, the food was quite disappointing. What stood out was their smoked salmon and water. Yes, I said water. Which means the other food really isn't that good.. . One of my friends ordered the French onion soup. He said there was waaay too much cheese and not enough onions. The broth was not beefy enough. My other friend ordered the steak burger and the meat also lacked flavor. The Dijon mustard they gave didn't even taste like Dijon. I ordered the chicken & mushroom crepes and I too was disappointed. The chicken was soooooo dry! I'm surprised because isn't French food supposed to be packed with flavors? Here everything is lacking!. . The 2 dishes that I did like was the smoked salmon appetizer and the smoked salmon & egg tartine salad. Surprisingly, I am normally not a big fan of smoke salmon but it was quite good here. Fresh & light! Finally, something right. Oh yeah, and the water was good. Either that or I was just dehydrating.. . Service was okay. We had to flag the servers down a few times.
Absolutely a wow experience.  Fantastic food, everything from appetizers to dessert.  Yes, save room for dessert!   The service was great despite the restaurant being very busy.  The wait for the patio was 1-2 hours so we didn't get to enjoy the fountain show.  Luckily, we had reservations and were seated immediately inside - no wait for the table and watched the fountains after dinner.  Thanks, Qaiser B, for an awesome recommendation!
Mon Ami Gabi is one of the few places in Vegas that I felt was good value for the price. I had breakfast here one morning and ordered the Blueberry French Toast, and I must say, it was delicious. Large slices of bread, fresh blueberries, whipped cream and blueberry syrup on top. Yum!
Having Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked for awhile, I finally got the chance to come by during my company vacation last December. We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.. . If you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.. . I started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.. . The service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.. . Not too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Cafe. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.. . P.S. Who's Gabi?
prime rib steak sandwich with horseradish an au jus dip. the sweet bun (brioche?) made for an interesting  treat for the tastebuds, and hangover. and damn, do they make some delicious fresh cut fries. i devoured every last crunchy bit.
Went here last night to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. The restaurant is neatly tucked underneath the Eiffel Tower of the Paris hotel. Scheduled our reservation through OpenTable, and after arriving we were seated within minutes. The place was packed, but I was very happy with our spot. . . To start off we were given a plate of carrot salad, and bread on the side. My lady hates carrots, but she thought it tasted great. The bread was good, although I was surprised it wasn't pre cut. Never tried escargot before, but we had to try! It was warm, tasty, and had a texture similar to scallops. We gobbled it up like candy. For the main course I ordered a Steak Bordelaise cooked medium rare. The steak was thin, and so tender my heart melted with every bite. The caramelized onion sauce was the perfect topping. My girlfriend's should've been the same, yet it was overcooked. The frites were ok but the whipped cauliflower had us licking the bowl.  We received a complimentary desert for her birthday. . . The restaurant has an intimate setting, so it may be hard to spot your waiter at times. Our waiter's service started off great, but declined over time. He checked on us less often, and was in a constant rush.  After we finished, I did the usual signing of the receipt since I paid with my card. The waiter immediately scooped it off the table while we were still talking. Definitely an awkward moment.. . If you're in the mood for french cuisine, check this place out. I have a feeling it may not be the best, but the prices are reasonable and the food is fantastic.
Great Al fresco dining , Good food, great selection, awesome bread, we eat here at least three time a month!
