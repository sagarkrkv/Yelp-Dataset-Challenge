came here for brunch and their guacamole and chips are so amazing and delicious! and their tomatillo sauce is crazy addicting! I had their verde chilequilles with chicken and it was very tasty! $5 dollar bloody mary and was made well. I'd definitely come back :)
Outstanding food and service. I had chorizo and egg and a side taco, girlfriend had chicken enchiladas. All above par. Sauces and dips all have the fresh veggie flavors. Well done.
One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. . . The chillaquiles were to die for. Get chicken and veggies on it.
Outstanding.  We waited a few minutes to get in and sampled a couple house speciality drinks that were very good. The patio area is quaint and comfortable. Food: we had the roasted corn, very tasty; guacamole, had bits of fruit that complemented the avocado;  the special was salmon that was very good. . . Overall very good food and service. We are on the patio.
This restaurant is getting a 3 from me because it has 5-star qualities and 1-star qualities.. . The good: Food is fantastic. The street tacos are very good and quite authentic. The Chiliquiles were delicious and cooked just right. The restaurant has a good ambiance, although a bit loud, and their patio is great to sit at.. . The bad: SERVICE!!! (they have none). Apparently, my group was not hipster enough, so our waiter paid us no attention. It took 3 requests and over 10 minutes to get some straws for our drinks. Coincidentally, our neighboring table was having a similar issue, as they had waited so long for their beers (which were sitting on the bar, already having been poured) that they arrived warm.. . If you go here, just make sure you aren't on a timetable.
Best rooftop in midtown! Best speciality drinks! Best apps! Best full menu! Can't go wrong here. Loved to come to their Wednesday night flamenco night (not sure if they're still doing this).
Awesome place. Great tacos, in 2 visits I have tried like half the menu. Never wait more than 15 minutes so far. Hostess always seem rude though, but servers are very friendly and that counts more. Like everyone says, guac and carne asada are amazing.
Met here with the same group of friends. . I had a shrimp taco this time (really good). and we shared a queso fundido with chorizo, which was kind of runny.. I also had a tamal oaxaqueno and it will not be my favorite item on the menu.. . The salsas are great, and I like how they are in ketchup like containers.. . This time we sat outside, the service was good and weather was gorgeous.
I saw this huge jar of olives and by gosh I wanted a handful!!! Little did I know... The bartender stuck his dirty hand right in the jar and grabbed a handful of olives out!!! Please wash your hands in and on my olives before you serve them to me... I would appreciate the germs and filth from you handling money all day on my olives to go please!!!! What bar-tending school did these people go to??? Why don't you also squeeze my lemon with ur filthy hand into my drink while you are at it??? Will you charge me extra for that service too please??? This place sux and btw my enchiladas were horrible!!! Has anyone ever  even been to Mexico??? If you are going to serve mexican food please at least make one trip down south so you know how it is supposed to be made!!!!! Any idiot can look up a recipe for a dish and mess it up cause you have no idea how it is supposed to taste!!! This restaurant was just as bad as the motel it was attached to!!!!
So that meal was unbelievable! This place has it all put together: fantastic food, healthy options and great service!. . I ordered the half chicken w/ grilled veggies and it was great! The craft beer that was paired with it was good and matched the dish perfectly. It was a fantastic meal.. . The service is really what stood out-equally as well as the food-which was awesome. They let me know when my food was going to take longer, why the wait was what it was. It was really helpful to have open communication.. . All in all this place was fantastic!
Those meals that are so good that you want to close your eyes with every bite. Heaven! Beautiful food. Beautiful setting. Perfect to be outside and soak it all in!. . The pork tacos and quinoa salad were perfect. . . Jessa is the best! Trust her suggestions and you will have a great meal. I told her this was my favorite culinary experience! Thanks again if you are reading this :)
My first reaction was OMG sooo yummy! Second reaction.... My new FAVoRITE Mexican place. Had the guac and ceviche to start.... AMAZING! Very tasty and lots of flavor. I could not eat fast enough. Had the shrimp, fish, and carne asada tacos, I'm stuffed. Soooooo good. Definitely worth it
This place has some really, really great food. Here are the high points: 1. The guacamole was phenomenal. 2. The Agua fresca was amazing. 3. The lime tart was great. 4. AMAZING QUINOA SALAD. Low points: 1. I didn't like my milkshake- chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream. 2. I didn't like the tortillas on my tacos. 3. The inside of the restaurant was extremely loud, so I suggest you grab a table outside.
Love all of the tacos, and I've tried them all. . . Great atmosphere. We lucked out and ended up here for happy hour without realizing it, which made trying all of the tacos easier.  :-). . Happy hour on weekends too. Awesome.
So good! Carne Asada tacos are my favorite here. I love their all of their salsas and it's hard to chose which is my favorite. . The ceviche is wonderful! I don't usually like shrimp, let alone ceviche, but I really enjoyed this. Defiantly one of my favorite spots.
The food here was delicious, especially the guacamole, chilaquiles (veggies) and shrimp tacos. The service is a little slow but it wouldn't deter me from coming back again. I also had the prickly pear margarita which was light and refreshing, get two.
Love this place! Never had anything bad. Tacos, breakfast, tortas all excellent. Great ambiance. Connected to the Clarendon it made for a really fun stay-cation in the summertime with a sweet pool right by bar!
I've been here twice, both times at breakfast. The coffee is delicious, the food is delicious, and it was an accommodating place to bring my 5 month old. I ordered the vegetable chilaquiles each time I've come here and I also had an order of pancakes. It was all amazing. The service was great, although be warned that this place isn't a regular restaurant it's a ~cool~ restaurant. . All in all great place for breakfast. I'd love to come at dinner & try their cocktails.
I'm probably in the minority here, but I think this place is just okay. We've gone several times because my boyfriend is a huge fan- maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things. I'm willing to give Gallo Blanco more chances!
Appearance wise...its an OK place set in a very neat historic downtown hotel. I was there my first time on a really crappy first date. Luckily the food, specifically the carne asada, was amazing. I have been back a couple of times since and although one of the trips was unbearably loud due to their music....i still say the carne is spot on.
The reviews for this place are good. Not sure if we went on a bad night or what. I liked the margarita... But they are very pulpy. Not everyone likes chewing their drink. I had the carne asada burrito. I think it would normally be good, but the meat was too charbroiled and left a burnt taste in my mouth. The chicken enchiladas were very good I was told.
