Nice ambiance (went for a friend's birthday dinner before going out, restaurant was playing top 40 hits) Food is a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality, although the spicy tuna rolls were pretty good! If you are looking to go to dancing later, you get free admission to Tao the lounge upstairs so that's a nice bonus.
It is a Fancy Asian Restaurant, being a vegetarian as usual I had limited choices but managed to eat few veggie dishes. We ordered Tao Temple salad, fried brown rice and a noodle dish..The food was alright, nothing great....ambiance was classy and it has spiritual theme. Service was little slow and the restaurant was packed...Saturday night!
I always make reservation here every time I am here in Vegas. I love the atmosphere and the food is absolutely amazing! My favorite so far I would have to say the filet mignon peppered steak with white rice on the side. The cocktails are strong and delicious. And on top of that if everyone in your party order an entree it's free admission to the night club. It's definitely worth every penny.
Tao Asion Bistro is a must from now on. A visit to Las Vegas is not complete until you dine at Tao. I went with a party of 5 and we all ordered different plates so we could share food and let's just say that we  were all extremely pleased. I don't even remember what we all ordered but it was all delicious. For around $30 a person you get excellent food and not your cookie cutter Chinese restaurant food, but extremely delicious food. The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent, service was great, and the food was prepared quick. The day after we all went to the Bellagio Buffet which was more expensive than Tao and the food was nowhere near to Tao. Bellagio buffet was a waste of money. I would have rated Tao 5 stars but I was unhappy with the way we felt as if were being hurried to leave the place so the next party could sit.
