Worth every penny of the $86 tab for two people. The flavors POPPED in every dish.. Very nice selection and the staff was a great help constantly coming around asking if you want drinks and clearing your table.. I know it's simple but the chicken noodle soup is a must try.
This buffet was my favorite for many years, but gradually they went downhill for a while and I stopped going there ... it was like they just got cheap and the prices didn't warrant that.  I then went to Wynn for a lot of years before giving Bellagio another chance last weekend.  OK ... they are doing better.  I would say they currently are on a par with Wynn and Wynn recently seems to have raised prices.  Bellagio is edging them out for value.  Wynn was running very close to $50 and it was early afternoon and not crab time.  Bellagio was cheaper than that and it was dinner prices.
We tried the buffet for lunch on a Friday afternoon and were very disappointed.  The service was basically nonexistent from the time we sat down, and getting a refill on a mimosa or a bloody mary took almost 10 minutes.  The atmosphere was cramped and felt claustrophobic, with people and dirty dishes sitting around everywhere.  There are no windows in the restaurant so the lighting is also very artificial and seems to cast a strange yellow glow over the room.  Not my idea of what a $38 buffet should be.  . . The food.  Oh, the food.  Bellagio has really dropped the ball on this one.  All of their other restaurants (including in-room service), really have excellent food, but everything here was just mediocre.  The soups were under seasoned, and the breakfast items all greasy and overcooked.  The sushi and seafood looked fresh, but upon tasting it back at the table I could tell that it was not of the quality I had come to expect of the property.  The "fresh" fruit was terrible, and the chefs/dining staff refilling stations during our visit were messy and impolite. . . Needless to say, we will not be going back.  There are MUCH better buffets on the Strip that I would visit.  Cheers!
After eating at the bacchanal at the Cesar palace no buffet was good enough for me . But last night my family and I gave the buffet at the bellagio a try and it was amazingly  good  worth every penny,. Good taste good quality and good price . It is small comparing with many but it's really good . looking forward to come back
The line was super long. Waited for like 45 minutes. . . The price is high. But it's normal for Vegas. . . The decor of the buffet is not very fancy. It is very much like all other buffets. . . The food was just okay. The variety was not great. The sushi bar lacks. The salad bar is not too bad. . . Overall, I did not enjoy my meal here.
A large number of options.  As I am gluten intolerant,  I asked the hostess as she was seating us for gluten free options.  She called the chef who was kind enough to give me a tour of the entire buffet.  The food was reasonably tasty and the salads were fresh.   The staff however seemed a bit too involved among themselves.  The dessert selection was extensive for the gluten tolerant but only two for those of us who can't consume gluten
I went to this buffet at around 7 and after reading all the awesome reviews I was really looking forward to it. I'm not sure what the deal was but almost everything was absolutely not worthy of the rating it has right now. . . There's a decent selection of food, from Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican and uh, steaks.. . The steaks were really hit and miss. If it was rare enough then it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really seasoned enough so prepare to drown it in Au jus or gravy. Every other time it was an extremely well done piece of leather. When you accompany that with wrong labelling (ie. Kobe Roast Beef which was just regular roast beef [an extremely lean one at that]) you have an even worse experience. . . The Italian pastas and pizza were okay. They were probably my favourite, but I didn't really want to load up on tortellini all night.  The brocelini was really good. . . The Japanese was also hit and miss. If you don't eat any of the rice, then the fish alone wasn't bad. They had tuna and salmon nigiri and a handful of mixed rolls and viet fresh rolls. The thing that bothered me most was the nigiri rice. It's not the right type of rice, it isn't seasoned properly and it's shaped with some sort of rice ball machine that makes it taste like rice paste afterwards. The seaweed salad was pretty good though.. . I honestly didn't touch the Chinese and in terms of the Mexican, the paella just had the taste of salted rice, and the slew of poached fish was extremely dry and overdone as well.  I didn't try the made to order tacos.   . . The crab legs come in king and snow varieties. I'm not sure if this is their fault, but I found them kinda powdery in terms of texture. Maybe it's because I think they use a band saw or something to cut them in half. . . There was a nice selection of deserts ranging from ice cream to cakes to flans. In my opinion the flans were way too sweet, the cakes had no personality (cheesecake tasted like cream and the tiramisu tasted like crappy coffee and nuts with cream).  The macarons (not macaroons btw) looked and tasted like they came out of a box and were the hardest things in the world. . . Either way, I didn't exactly pay for this dinner as it was a comp. at 37 dollars, I would NEVER recommend anyone pay this for a mediocre buffet. Unless you can prove me otherwise I would advise to stay away.
We did some snooping online for buffet after the Monte Carlo dropped the ball on us and made me very hesitant on trying another buffet on my birthday trip but OH MY MY! I just loved the food in here. . . The line to get in was only about 3 parties deep but it took us about 25 minutes to be seated which was really annoying. WTF? How hard is it to just tell people to sit and take their drink orders UGH...Nobody acknowledged our wait for the longest time with an apology or an "I'm sorry for the wait". Not cool or very professional for something inside a nice hotel like the Bellagio. I was expecting stellar service walking in and I don't think that was a very nice first impression of the place.. . This place was very pricey but we got in line about 30 minutes prior to the dinner but paid the lunch price for the place. . . Some of the dishes that were available were: crab legs with butter, prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy, tortellini, 4 different types of pizzas to choose from, some kobe beef, seared salmon. The array of desserts were some of my favorites. Little cappuccino pudding cups, coffee tiramisu, macaroons, creme brulee, flan....excuse me I'm starting to drool all over again. . . The place is pricey and I would have liked much more attentive service. I noticed the waiters were clearing a lot of tables thinking the customers were done only to have the patrons return to their table cleared and their drinks nowhere to be found. I also think the lighting had a really ugly yellow glow. It seemed kind of dim and boring.
This is one of my go to buffets in Las Vegas. I've tried a number of times to get into Bacchanal, but the line is worse that lines at Disneyland. Iate here this past Sunday around 7pm and to my surprise, I was able to walk all the way to the cashier without having to wait in line.. . I LOVE the food here. It's the only buffet that I am aware of that serves poke. They have both tuna and salmon poke and it is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!! I also love the fact that they serve king crab here. Most of the buffets I go to serve snow crab, so it's not very often that I get to eat king crab. . . Table service is very prompt considering how busy this place gets. Dirty plates are picked up just about as soon as you are done with the plate and drink refills come around before you even finish your drink. . . There is a carving station that I like, but sometimes it's a hit and miss. The prime rib is usually ok, although sometimes it was too overdone for my liking. There was kobe beef at the carving station during my last visit, but it was WAY to well done for my liking. I like my beef red, especially if it's kobe.
Poor poor selection !!! Pure disappointment for this type of restaurant to have such small selection of food !!!! :(
The food was pretty good, but what set this place apart from the other buffets in Vegas is their desserts. So many to choose from and they are delicious =D
I came here and decided to try this Buffett since I heard it was highly recommended from other people and I wasn't very much satisfied for a buffet especially in Vegas at the Belagio.  I thought Belagio would be more high class for a better buffet but it wasn't.  Their food just seemed normal and some of the pastas I tried weren't really tasty at all.  The food selection I thought seem to lack a lot.  The dessert selection does not compare to Wicked spoon's Buffett inside of the Cosmo especially since they do not have real ice cream and it's the one that comes out of a machine with very limited toppings you can choose (like 4 toppings total).. . I will definitely not be back here.
This is the best buffet I've ever been to! Although we had to wait in a huge line for over an hour, it was so worth it! The server was constantly pouring us drinks, our glasses were never empty. The food was amazing and there's not a single thing that would upset me. The price is reasonable, the food selection is wide, and the service is wonderful.
Not the best buffet I've been to. The variety was subpar. . . There was a prior rib that was good. The Kobe steak was not as good. The crab was very salty. But the nice part is that they have it sliced so you don't have to crack it.
Disappointed.  Granted, it is one of the cheaper buffets; I feel like the money I spent on this place could have bought a much higher quality, more satisfying meal elsewhere.
Didn't get to go on the weekend, I went for a late breakfast, under $20 M-T.  No line to get in.  Smoked salmon was great with capers and onions.  Lots of options and desserts...sorbets and ice cream.  We were seated in a nice quiet area, some of the other locations were packed with people.  Ribs tender, London broil cooked to perfection, I like mine under med rare...  The best part was it was free...
I would give this more of a 3.5 star rating. Went here since it was listed on the top 10 buffets in Vegas multiple times. It was about $35 for  lunch here. Thankfully, the line was not awfully long and we got seated right away. The decor here could use a serious facelift. It feels like a pretty old space. With the right decor, I think more people would enjoy their dining experience! . . The variety was just OK. I guess they did hit on a lot of different types of cuisines, but a lot of the dishes were average and not memorable in both presentation and appeal. A lot of things I just looked at and passed on because they looked messy. . . Some highlights: calamari Greek salad (really tender and tasty!), carving station (prime rib), 2 different types of crab (snow and king, but both super frozen), pesto mashed potatoes, herbed polenta, and chocolate covered strawberries! They had spicy tuna hand rolls which were made-to-order. They were ok, a little on the spicy end. I wish they had more custom sushi roll options. . . Service was really good--they came back a lot for refills and to clear our plates. A decent option if in the area.
Excellent food, prime rib, crab, roast beef, lamb were all good. NIce array of mini desserts that weren't cheapy tasting, a real chef designs and prepares this food.  The price is hefty for 4 it's about $170, so plan to go slow or you will get full and not get to try it all!
EVERYTHING that I put in my mouth was DELICIOUS!!!  My mom and I came here on a Wednesday morning at 10:30 am and so we paid the breakfast price but got the lunch food too!!  I loved everything I ate, my mom did too!  The sushi was awesome and not dried out like the Wicked Spoon.  The desserts were just amazing.  I would highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch and dinner!!!
Our last buffet in Vegas. We had brunch at the Wynn the day before, but the Bellagio didn't disappoint. Highlights were the "healthy" salad bar in the middle that had dried fruit and pre-made salads that were asian and mediterranean-inspired, grilled salmon, flank steak (SO GOOD), spaghetti squash, glazed carrots, and chicken. And all you can eat shrimp, of course. My friends loved the desserts too.
I went twice and has somewhat different experiences.  Once was for breakfast and we ordered the bottomless mimosas.  The lady seemed to avoid us on purpose and we had to practically beg to end up with 2 very tiny mimosas each.  On the other hand, the food was really good and I enjoyed my experience overall.  We tried several other buffets while in Vegas and had varying results, so on the last day we returned here for dinner.  The service was much better and the food was even more amazing than before.  I am a vegetarian and my honey eats almost only meat.  We both had so many choices that we ended up gorging ourselves.  Now I get why LV is famous for buffets.
For a 5 star resort they DEFINITELY do not have a 5 star buffet. After hearing that this was the buffet to visit while in Vegas I decide to go with my wife and our friends to this buffet and experience the mother of all buffets. It was more like a over priced Home Town Buffet than a 5 star buffet. The made to order omelets were that same as the omelets you get at El Torito Sunday buffet, which are good. The prim rib was very disappointing, it tasted like boiled meat. This was the first time I had ever tried eggs Benedict and they were disgusting. I hate to throw away food, but I had to push my plate to the side and let our waitress take it. The rest of my party assured me that eggs Benedict tastes a lot better than what was being served at this buffet, I guess I will give them one more try at a different restaurant. Just about every item that I tried reminded me of cafeteria food and if I didn't try it it was because it wasn't very appealing. I would rate the dessert bar 4 stars, the dining area was extremely outdated and helped support my thinking of this place as a cafeteria. Not that there is anything wrong with cafeterias but for $32 a person I was expecting a lot better all around. The night before, we dined at Tao in the Venetian and the average was $30 a plate and I will rate them 5 stars as soon as I am done with this. I would definitely NOT recommend this buffet. Save your $32 and go to a way nicer place with way better food and atmosphere. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because they did have a wide variety of food.
Not worth the money.  Little variety and not much flavor.  Cold Food.
I had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night.  Although the line to get in was long and time consuming, the food was worth the wait!  Once sat, I was greeted promptly by a server and provide with a drink.   I started with the seafood section and the crab legs were delicious.   Next I hit the Asian and BBQ sections of the buffet.   Both had many different options.   Service was great and the good was second to none.   If your in the mood for a superior vegas buffet, I strongly suggest Bellagio Buffet!
I wish, so badly, that I could give this a decent review. We stayed at the Bellagio for a week, and it was LOVELY. The buffet, on the other hand, was not. We decided, at the last minute, to visit for dinner. While the selection of main dishes was huge, the food itself was NOT. The crab legs & shrimp were watery/mushy & rather tasteless. The "kobe beef" was a bit on the stringy/tough side. The salmon was over-cooked. The blue fish was mushy. The veggie side dishes were good. A large variety of desserts were available, and in an effort to taste as many as possible without wasting, my husband & I each got several and then halved & swapped. They were beautifully presented; I wish they had come close to tasting as wonderful as they looked. In short, we were horribly disappointed. If you don't try, you won't know, but really....for the $86 it cost us (as a couple) to "try", I can't help but wish we never knew. Sorry, Bellagio.
Peeled jumbo shrimp cocktail....mmmmmmmmm. . I'll come here if I can afford to come to another buffet after I hit up Bachanal at the Ceasar's Palace, stomach-wise and wallet-wise.  But this place isn't a bad plan B for buffets.  But if you're staying here...well, when in Rome...eat buffet.. . Very good variety of food here.  Price is typical for the premier high-end buffet these days.
