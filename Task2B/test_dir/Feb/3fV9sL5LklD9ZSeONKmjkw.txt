We/I thought that this would be a great place to enjoy the Super Bowl.  I reserved a table for the nominal (relatively nominal - as it was much more expensive elsewhere) fee of $125 per person which bought us reserved seats, unlimited menu food, and an open bar that afforded us water, soda, well liquors, milk shakes and an impressive assortment of beers.  I thought this was a great idea until I did the math and came to find out that there was NO way I would eat or drink $125 worth of food within the 4 hour game window.  That being said, on to the review:. . This is a stylized burger joint.  Two bars.  It offers 11 televisions and your choice of bar, booth or table seating.  . . The Menu consists of Burgers (of course) and a wide variety of pupus.  We ordered BBQ nachos (by fair the best), curly fries, waffle fries, hot wings (these were NO joke, HOT as Hades), chili cheese fries, and an Asian salad.  Unfortunately we NEVER were able to order anything else.. . The service, although pleasant, was MEDIOCRE at best.  I understand that they may have been overwhelmed at the sudden onslaught of orders, but damnit please bring my food in a timely manner.  Not only was it slow (45 minutes!), once we received the food there were 3 extra orders of wings, 1 additional nacho, 1 additional waffle fries and they tried to give us a BLT burger, too.  Crazy right?  With a table full of carbs (that we didn't order and that we could never finish), our waiter never once asked if we were ready for the protein portion of the meal.  Although our friend, who ordered the Asian salad, wretched after taking two bites and sent it back.  Sad really.. . My wife enjoyed her two milkshakes ordered to cool off her mouth from the wings.  Mocha mudslide I think.. . Even though the service was suspect, they STILL added on an automatic gratuity.  Are you f'n kidding me?. . I had a few drinks but, I swear, after the second one, there wasn't a drop of alcohol in the rest.  Probably a good thing, maybe he was watching my back, NO IDEA.. . Generally VERY disappointed with the entire experience ......  the restaurant, the service, the food, the drinks, and yes especially the GAME.
The is an upscale burger joint.  Don't expect a $5 burgers here, folks.  They also have a decent selection of macro- and micro-brews, as well as signature cocktails.. . We went for lunch on 02/06/14.  The restaurant was full, but didn't have to wait long to be seated.  The server didn't come to our table for almost 7 minutes after we were seated. Awkward. I would've hoped for a "I'll be with you in just a moment", or something like that.  . . The food took a little while to arrive at the table.  The food was hot and tasty.  The total bill for a burger, entree salad, beer, and coke was $61 (including tip). . . If our service had been more prompt, I might have given BLT a 4-star rating.  If you're in a hurry, consider going elsewhere.  If you have time to mellow on an adult beverage, then by all means, c'mon on in!
Every time I come to Vegas, I simply must stop at BLT for a milkshake! It's a Vegas staple for me! I don't eat red meat, so a burger place is sort of wasted on me but their BBQ chicken nachos are delish! Every one I was with loved their burgers, so I guess I can say they have good burgers?
So many good places to eat in the Mirage and it might be easy to walk past this one, but don't.  Hamburger is its specialty, so you should stick with it.  Not the best I ever had, but it was good, so really no complaints.  Not sure why everyone raves about sweet potato fries; they are just yucky, this place or any where else.  Uck.  Milk shakes are good and shouldn't be missed.  If you are counting calories, then this is not a good place to stop.  But you're in Vegas.  If you ain't counting your money, then why count your calories?
Do not go here!!! Save your money, this place is not worth it at all!!! . . Ok so, the only reason we ate here was because it is located in the lobby of our hotel (The Mirage). We didn't leave the room til late that day, so we decided to just eat at BLT because we were so hungry, the menu sounded decent, and the front desk lady had recommended it because they serve "spiked milkshakes". . . We were pretty excited to try out the food, so I ordered the chicken buffalo burger with fries and a malibu rum milkshake and my friend ordered a cheese burger with fries and a twinkie milkshake. First of all, just two plates of burgers, fries, and milkshakes cost us 65 dollars, which would have been ok if the food was any good!. . My spiked milkshake had no rum and my friends twinkie milkshake tasted like frozen milk with a piece of twinkie sticking out of it. The burgers were not tasty at all, mine had some kind of nasty blue cheese spread (mind you I love blue cheese), the fries had an aftertaste, and the ranch dressing was watery. Just disgusting, never again!! We didn't even get half way through our meal.....
Good place if you're craving a good gourmet burger. . We got seated as soon as we walked in. Our orders were taken within 5 mins of sitting down. However, we waited about 20-25 mins. Before we got our food. It didnt seem busy, our food could have been hotter.. They have a great selection of bugers. I ordered one with sweet caramelized onions, and mushrooms, with blue cheese. It was good! The burger was cooked to perfection. Wish it was served on a warm bun. (Not sure if its normally served in a cold bun, or if it was sitting there for a while).. The waiters were nice. They made sure we were doing ok. . I would recommend this place to anyone
This place was one of the few close-by that was still open late at night.  Otherwise, I probably would've chosen something else.  The burger wasn't bad, nothing memorable.  Overpriced, like many average hotel restaurants here - it's all about convenience.  I would definitely choose another spot for my late-night cravings next time though.
