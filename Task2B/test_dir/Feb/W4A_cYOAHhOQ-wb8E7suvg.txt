I'm the guy that has been to Vegas many times and could have seriously cared less to go to one of these shows.....until I did..... . WOW, absolutely breathtaking and money well spent.  After seeing one, we actually modified our trip to stay and see two more!. . I fully intend to return to Vegas to see many more shows.  What amazes me is that these performers can do this over and over and over with perfection.
Still a great production but I was expecting to be more impressed based on hype.   Le Reve's theater is beautiful and just walking in makes you feel like something cool is going to happen.  While the show had some great moments, it got kind of repetitive to me and the storyline was pretty lame. I actually dozed off at some parts of the show. They just do the same thing over and over without enough wow-factor moments to keep me fully engaged. Sometimes there were too many people on the small stage and in the air...I didn't know what to focus on. Seats higher up are better because you get a bigger field of vision to see everything.  People say not to compare it to O but it's hard not to given the acrobatic themes and water-based stage. I'd rather watch O for the 3rd time than Le Reve for the second
Saw this show on Saturday night and loved it!  The seats are so comfortable, you almost want to stay and take a nap after.. If they only reclined!  The theater was a good size and it appeared that any seat in the house would provide a good view.  We were in the 5th row from the water and I almost wish I was a little higher up as there was a lot going on above and around the stage.  The story is odd, but a dream and we all know that dreams can be zany and confusing :) the performers were amazing, expressive and so talented.  The strength of the performers had me in awe.   Some of the releases into the water from such heights, were gasp worthy.  I enjoyed every moment and only wished I had such dreams and a glittery wardrobe of my own..  One of the best Birthday gifts I have received.
Absolutely breathtaking.  Okay, so I don't completely get the storyline...but the show is so well put together.  Multiple times I was sitting in awe wondering how they did it.  Definitely a must see if you're in vegas.
A very ho-hum show.  The theater was absolutely gorgeous...not a bad seat in the house.  The show, however, leaves one to wonder how the creative genius behind Cirque du Soleil could've created such a boring show.  Let me emphasize, this is not a Cirque show.  Le Reve was created by the same artistic director who created the fantastic Cirque shows in Vegas.  My suggestion is to save your money, bypass this show, and instead watch one of the other Cirque shows in town (Mystere is by far my favorite).
As a local, I have seen all the most popular Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas.  Le Reve although I hear not technically considered CDS is right up there at the top of the list. I don't see a difference other than technically calling it a CDS.  My first trip to Le Reve did not disappoint.  Even though I've been a professional athlete for 10 years I am still in awe of the performers. They can do things I can't even imagine attempting. The amount of work and dedication they put into their art is second to none.  These people are the best of the best! . . Le Reve has a lot of water acts in it. Synchronized swimming, high diving, etc.  It is mixed with some very cool acrobatics acts.  There is a cool story line that goes along with the show.  I could go more in detail but really you have to see it for yourself. Anyone who gives this show a bad review is just a negative person trying to be a hater. There is literally nothing negative you can say about the show.  Would definitely see again.  The show lasted about 90 minutes.
Amazing show. Loved every second of it. Was applauding until my hands felt like they were about to fall off.
