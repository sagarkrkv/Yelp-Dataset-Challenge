Didn't like the wait but the food was amaze-balls.. . Whole rack of baby back ribs and 2 sides for $28 .. not bad!. . Service was a bit slow (had to ask for sauce like 3 times) but she was nice.. . Then they mentioned the yelp offer and we took advantage of the discount! plus free donuts at the end.
Excellent food and awesome service... Thanks to Rishad!!! Keep up the great work... I will be back for sure!!!
Excellent food, I had the brisket and sausage link meal. For the sides I had potato salad and mac n cheese. The sides were just perfect.  My least favorite item was the brisket, it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. I still managed to give it 4 stars because everything else exceeded my expectations.  Tony was my server and customer service was superb.  Very attentive and sweet. I will be back
I do love Barbeque and ribs and Bobby Q delivers exactly what you pay for.. . Pulled pork is good, but not as good as Texas Roadhouse up the street.. Ribs are all right, but the meat quality is no where near that of a 4 or 5 star joint.. Steak is just bad. . . This is an ideal place for take-out or a quick lunch sit in; don't bring your bbq savvy friends or girlfriend here.
Ashlynn was our server. She provided excellent service with useful suggestions about our meal.. . We had the winning combination of catfish with prime rib, roasted corn, grilled vegetables, and baked potatoes. And of course, some corn bread to begin the meal.. . Overall, the highlight of the meal was the prime rib and the catfish. Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned as it should be. Roasted corn was a little more on the buttery side, but still tasted flavorful. Grilled vegetables were a little skimpy. Baked potato was a baked potato.. . We ended with complimentary house made donuts. Not just one...a bag of mini donuts!!
I've stayed in Phoenix for more than 18 months, and I must say their bbq ribs is one of the best, if not the best, in the US. Fall-off-the-bone is the most precise word to describe it. I love the place, it's so woody and it really brings the southern feel. Highly recommended appetizers are the Crispy Sweet Onion Block and Q-rolls. As for the entree, all the ribs available in their menu and smoked prime rib top my list. Sides are equally tasty too - mac and cheese, shoestring fries, roasted corn and pecan coleslaw. The complimentary corn bread and baked potato (only comes if you order winning combination) are also superb.
Since there have been so many reviews of Bobby Q, I'll just quickly review our experience with food and service. See pictures too.. . Hot wings: very juicy (good quality chicken). Wifey thought the sauce was a bit "different" (i.e., not true buffalo authentic), but she enjoyed them nonetheless. They were a bit spicy, but not so hot that you finish your beer in 5 seconds (more like 30 seconds, but I digress) The veggie were also good, if you're into that sort of thing... . Pull Pork Sandwich: the pork itself was excellent. Big chunks of meat (not shredded), which was very tender. They serve it with a little BBQ sauce (but you can supplement), a pickle on the side, and a side of your choice. The bun, however, was very buttered - too much for my taste, and slightly burnt. I would probably tell them to hold the bun next time (or the butter!). . Baby-back ribs: I really wanted to like these since they looked so good (and fall-off-the-bone tender). However, they were VERY smoky - perhaps it was just the sauce, but it was definitely a detraction for me. I routinely go to the south for BBQ (so my expectations may be high) but I would pass on these in the future. Wifey also thought they were very salty, but she tends to be more sensitive to that than me.. . Shoe-string french fries: as good as they sound. Very tasty, super thin, and salty. Would definitely get these again.. . Service: very attentive and friendly. In addition to our main server, we had 2 other staff check up on us (as part of their routine), but it was not intrusive at all.. . Beer on tap: went with the Bobby Q brown ale and later a Kiltlifter. The Bobby Q was a bit too nutty - definitely going with the Kiltlifter next time!
I'm certainly jaded by the variety of outstanding BBQ joints in Texas, so my visit to Bobby Q just wan't mind blowing.. . In and of itself, Bobby Q has fine, workaday BBQ. The ribs are fall-of-the-bone moist, but almost entirely lacking in flavor save for whatever sauce you slather them in. No smokiness, no meatiness, just sauce. . . The mac-and-cheese is average, not good, not bad, and the coleslaw is mayo based, which I hate. Fortunately it's priced right, heck, it's downright cheap for decent BBQ, and our server was awesome. . . Not a bad BBQ spot by any stretch of the imagination.
Great food   I had the smoked prime rib and my pop and jean had the baby back ribs.   The ribs were fall off the bone tender.   Prime rib was fantastic.  2 thumb up for this place
Hands down the best tasting BBQ in Arizona ! Hubby and I shared the smoasted. Chicken, roasted veggies and corn, and potato salad. Our server Rebekah was beyond helpful as it was our first time there. She even got us small sample of their Mac n cheese which was nice n creamy.  . . Despite the fact that we got there ten minutes before closing this was a really good experience.
Very good food and service. Nice bar area with TV available.
Wow! We were in this area and decided to yelp for the highest rated restaurant. Bobby Q's was the one. We were so happy with our choice! The food and service were both amazing. Our kids walked away saying it was the best restaurant ever. The baby back ribs and smokehouse burger were the best. We also enjoyed the corn bread muffins at the beginning.  We will definitely be coming back. It's a new favorite for us.
We were in the area and decided to Yelp our dinner location. This place came up at the top of the search with over 500 reviews, you know we had to see what all the fuss was about. Coming down 27th street we thought Google Maps was getting us lost. There was no way a bomb BBQ joint was next to all these apartments. Well once we passed the last apartment building on the right, we saw Bobby's. The building was not impressive from the parking lot, not to mention we were parked behind the restaurant. I thought rusty shack = good food. I was glad I stuck with my instinct. . We turned the corner and could instantly smell the smoker putting in work on slabs of ribs and brisket. Inside the decor was modern and clean. After seating we were greeted quickly and with a smile. I could hardly listen to what she saying because my eyes were fixated on the 40 chickens rolling in the rotisserie oven. We ordered the Hog Heaven plate for three of us, while my son had the smokehouse burger. Let me just say this is plenty of food for a family of 4. Four choices of meats with three sides. I highly recommend the baby back ribs as one of the meats. If you have no teeth, you can still chew these. My mouth had an orgasm when I bit into them. They were so tender, there was no knife needed to separate them. The brisket, St. Louis ribs, and chicken rounded out the plate. Mac and cheese side dish is a must! So creamy and the cheese was outstanding. You can tell that time was taken to prepare our meal that came out quickly. The cornbread was oven hot and was perfectly cooked with a hint of crunchiness on the edges. I had the Bobby Q Ale for my drink and it was a solid choice. It was very bold and complimented the BBQ sauce that was all over my fingers. Visit this place in the near future, hopefully your experience is as good as mine. This spot moved into the first priority when dining out in Phoenix.
Love it, love it, love it. Food is great can't stop ordering take out. This is not a Texas restaurant but as close as Arizona can get too one. Can't wait to go again.
Found this place through Yelp because Pappadeaux's was packed and I wanted a Poboy! Our server Chelsea asked us if it was our first time there, and was excited to tell us they age their meats and slow cook them. My bf and I weren't sure what we wanted for an appetizer, so Chelsea recommended Q-pops. They were mouth watering beef brisket taquito type appetizers with BBQ sauce and chipotle sauce. The Mister ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Grilled Veggies and I got my Catfish Poboy with Potato Salad. Everything was so delicious!!! They also give you cornbread, which tasted sweet. I cannot wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu!
I ordered take-out on a business trip: fire roasted rotisserie chicken w/ mac&cheese and a wedge salad. . Chicken was falling off the bone delicious. I'm a health nut, and although I know bleu cheese dressing is "better" for you, this stuff tastes so incredible you would never know.. . Not the low-key hole-in-the wall kind of place, but still seemed fun for a chain-like dining experience. I would certainly go back.
So as a last meal in az this was pretty epic! Phenomenal service-I was checked on by several people, the food came out seriously fast. Best of all tony gave me good recommendations and made sure my meal was epic. I'm sorry to report he succeeded.. . The food was fabulous. I got the 3 meat combo and of that the baby back ribs were my favorite. The chicken was fantastic and the beef brisket was great but hats off to anyone that can cook a pig that good! The grilled veggies were tastie and made me feel better about eating here. The beans were also great.. . The sauces were also very tasty. I highly recommend the spicy to anyone who wants a zip to their sauce. All in all a great last meal in AZ before going back to Cali
Best place for ribs outside of Kansas City and by far the best place in Phoenix. I prefer  the St Louis style. Staff is super friendly and beer is served ice cold.
I really like the atmosphere and food at this place. We eat there all the time for work, and I have yet to eat a bad meal. The service is great. I would highly recommend it for anyone.
Favorite BBQ place to go! .  I had the lunch platter, which was St. Louis ribs, BBQ chicken, and beef brisket. Oh my lord, was it so heavenly good. As good as it looked. The brisket was my favorite, so tender and flavorful. All the meat just falls off the bone, so soft and dee-licious!. Can't forget to mention their mac n' cheese, so creamy and cheesy, best mac n'cheese in the world! I might be reaching, but I promise you it was oh so good! Also we loved the cornbread. Cute little patties is how they come out, and we can't tell you how those little donuts they serve after each meal, how tasty those little things are, a little sweet and crunchy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside. We loved this place so much, we came back the next day for dinner, seriously! I'm pretty sure you'll love it too.
I came year last August (late review...sorry) and I was SUPER impressed! The ambiance was much different from most BBQ joints. It was a bit on the sleek side which I liked very much. My hubby & I opted for the catfish po boy...(at a BBQ joint..go figure!) and that sucker was GOOD! I liked at the end of the meal they give you these wonderful little fresh donuts...Ahhh...be still my beating heart...When I go back to Phoenix, I'll be hitting up this place! One more thing... Location is a bit awkward. If You're headed to this restaurant & if it feels like you're lost.. You're not...it's in somewhat of a residential area.
Service: We definitely had great service. Prompt attention from our server Phil and the manager stopped by. . . Decor: Country shabby clean. Dark woods, colors and Distressed textures; high ceilings made the place feel open and large.. . Food and drink: Full bar; mediocre strawberry daiquiri & good virgin strawberry lemonade. The corn had great flavor along with the corn bread patties. Grilled chicken and ribs had decent flavor, a little smokey, very little char. .. The ribs were very tender but the chicken was a tad dry. Great smoked sausage and shoestring fries. The bbq sauce was tasty, not overly sweet and not to runny. Cinnamon donuts are a nice touch at the end of the meal.. . Overall I would give it 3.5. It wasn't bad,  it just wasn't outstanding.
Ridiculously the Best 1st Time Experience of My Life!  This was My Last Stop Before Heading Back to  L.A. The Front Desk at THE CROWNE PLAZA Highly Recommended this Place Since I was Here on a Business Trip. I Was Ready to Head Back to PAPPADEAUX'S SEAFOOD KITCHEN for the 3RD Time this Weekend and I'm Soooo Glad I Took Their Advice! . .  MONIQUE Was My Server.  And Not Only Was She On Top of Her Game and Answered My Questions with the Conviction of a Preacher Giving A Sermon on a Sunday,  But She was as Beautiful as the Heavanly CORN BREAD She Brought Me and My Client!  For Starters the Q-ROLL'S Were SCRUMPTIOUSLY Delicious with 2 Different Sauces! The MIX COMBO MEAT PLATTER of BEEF BRISKET AND PULLED PORK Was Off the Chain JUICY and FORK TENDER! The BOBBY Q CHEESE BURGER that My Client Ordered was As Thick, Juicy and Made To Order as Any I Have Ever Laid Eyes On! Unfortunately,  I Wasn't Prepared to Handle Desert, (THERE VERSION OF BANANA CREAM PIE,  OUCH!) Especially Since I Had a 5 Hour Road Trip Back to La La. CAN I SAY FOOD COMA!  NOT! I'm Not Gonna Get Pulled Over By ARIZONA HIGHNOON PATROL For a DUI A La BOBBY Q! . And If You Even Think that I'm Over Playin' My Hand then Just Head Over There and Call My Bluff! . . Like General Douglas Mac Arthur said to the People of the Philippines in WWII or Arnold Schwarzenegger said in The Terminator... "I'LL BE BACK"!
Love the St Louis ribs,  not crazy about the beef ribs though.  The best cornbread! Service is usually good, and the prices are reasonable for the quality. A great neighborhood joint.
Excellent BBQ and we had outstanding service on a Sunday evening.  This was a recommendation from the local wine bar & were very thankful she sent us this way. . We ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, & pulled pork.  Everything was tender, no fat, and both the regular & spicy sauces were very good.  Mac-cheese was PERFECT!  We were too full for dessert, but managed to enjoy the Thank Q's (just wait-finger licking good) we got with the bill.  A must when in the Glendale area.
Just as delicious as it was five years ago! Jessica was our waitress and took excellent care of us! We split the hog heaven and almost finished it. The brisket melts in your mouth! And the doughnuts...no matter how full I am they are a sweet finale!!
