This is the third Margaritaville we have been to...Key west was def. the best (food-wise), but this location had the best entertainment. The nachos are a must at any location! Pretty cool to grab a bite to eat, enjoy the show, then play a hand or two of Blackjack next door.
Awesome place! Kevin is an awesome bartender too, he gave out a few free rounds and he's got some impressive skills.
This is more like 3.5 stars. I love the fun atmosphere at Margaritaville restaurants. This is one of my favorites, and we have been to almost all of them. Great drinks!! Get the Perfect Margarita, but, be careful, you will feel it in the morning. Try Volcano nachos and wings, cannot go wrong. Wasting away indeed in Margaritaville...
I will always make it a point to stop at margaritaville when the opportunity arises! It's a fun place to listen to some jimmy and have a nice frozen drink. . I had the Havana banana frozen drink and I was in love. It was very filling but so good I couldn't stop sipping!!! Also, they have a dedicated gluten free menu and gluten free buns!! I was excited about that! The service seemed slow and the servers were a bit careless just meandering around but at least we had some island tunes to distract us.
New menu as of December. Big mistakes. Weird combos of sweet and salty on the burgers. Dangerous crack on the wooden plate the quesadilla came on, no idea how they think this is considered safe. It's uncleanable. Can't be washed. Service took forever too. Go elsewhere, or if you must come, go with the $5 tacos. They were good.
I've always been a fan of Jimmy Buffett, so when a few friends suggested we grab some food at Margaritaville, my mouth started to water for a salty rim, full of tequila. However, I was disappointed with this location [I've been to the one in Orlando], for the following reasons.. . 1. It was packed. Being in the serve industry, I know things get busy and I tend to get annoyed with patrons that bitch and moan about a wait. I wasn't one of those people, but some in my party were. I explained to them the sitch, so they calmed down. After all, we did have a 12 pack to drink, while we waited. . 2. We were seated shorter than our wait time, and brought back towards the bar. It took our server a good 12 minutes to greet us, and by that time we had figured out our orders, as we were just going to split a handful of apps to save a few bucks.. 3. The food was meh. I wasn't impressed with the nachos, but did find the wings to be pretty good.. 4. Prices were much higher than i've ever seen them...this is vegas of course.. . Overall, it wasn't anything special and didn't ooze the typical JB charm. Oh well, we can't win them all.
Play the amazing drinking game we invented. Hang out on the balcony outside the lower bar and take a shot anytime someone runs into the fire hydrant on the sidewalk! And the crab shrimp dip is great!
Very good food and drinks! Went here for lunch and I would recommend trying it. I had the fish tacos with rice and black beans. My table also ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer. Overall I would come back again for sure.
I am local, and this is one of my most favorite places to bring my out-of-towners. It's in a central location, it's super fun, and the food is great. . . It is usually pretty busy, but with three floors of seating, you'll usually get yourself seated in under 20 minutes. There's plenty to do while you wait: gamble in the Margaritaville casino, check out the gift shop, catch a drink at one of the many bars (try the Landshark "loaded," you won't regret it), play the Ringmaster game, watch the Volcano show (on the hour every hour), or people watch on the balcony outside. For a fantastic view, go upstairs to the 3rd floor. It's not always open, so just ask the staff first. . . They recently revamped their menu with some fantastic offerings. I've tried most everything on the menu, and it's all fantastic. Their burgers are to die for. 100% beef and worth the try! New crab cake sliders are a great snack if you aren't too hungry. Their blended adult drinks...you gotta get one. It's a must, but be warned: as good as they taste, they WILL sneak up on you. My personal favorite is the Havanas and Bananas. . . The show is a little hokey, as one reviewer pointed, out...but that's the entire point! And you don't have to pay for it! At night they have a on-stage DJ that spins appropriate tunes.. . The staff really gets into the spirit of the tropics here. They are all very friendly and attentive.
Food was reasonably priced for Strip food. The gimmick is OK. Server was good but seemed like the kitchen was on break. Waited 40mins for 2 entrees. Otherwise, not bad.
