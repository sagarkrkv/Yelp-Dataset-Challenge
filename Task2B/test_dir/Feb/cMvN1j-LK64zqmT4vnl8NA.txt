On the outside (which is inside the Cosmopolitan), it resembles that of a truck/street vendor, but don't be fooled: Here lies a 2-in-1 deal so unique.. . To the right is the Mexican food, to the left is the Chinese food. Your choice, choose wisely.  . . I decided to go with carb overload and steer towards the noodles.  Dan Dan Mian they're called: wheat noodles with spicy pork bits.  It was incredible. When it arrived, my first thought was "This is freakin' tiny".  I thought I could eat five of them!  So yes, small portion...but wowww is it tasty.  . . Also went with the salt and air margarita, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it.  I give her props too, because she could give a Tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. The salt "air" was a cloud of ecstasy.  Yum.. . So yeah... a little expensive but unique dishes.
Love this place. The entire theme/concept is awesome. I mean, Chinese meets mexican... c'mon:) Probably my favorite restaurant ever. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is its pricey to say the least. But... some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted. Try the guacamole... out of this world!
I was excited to try another of Jose Andres restaurants. Of note, compared to many of his other restaurants, this one is a bit more casual. . . The drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. They also have a large variety of different mescals. . . This is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. The shrimp mojo and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  The tuna ceviche was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good. . . A bit pricey compared to his other restaurants for the lesser experience but otherwise a fun place to have a casual bite.
Great menu, fantastic flavors.  The mojo shrimp were amazing And the ceviche is a must have.  The drinks are also well done.  The drink are well done; original but not too over the top. Prices are fair
I want to live off the salt air margarita. It's delicious and not to be missed. All Chicagoans are extremely spoiled with great Mexican food so the tacos here were not my favorite, however, the steamed buns and guac were delicious. Our server Terry was also worth a 5 star rating. Las Vegas houses some of the best service in the country and most are all-stars but he really made us love our time there. I would definitely recommend this place if you need somewhere quick to stop before grabbing a later dinner or show in or near the Cosmo.
My friend talked up Chef Jose Andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to DC that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to China Poblano at the Cosmopolitan, I figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. . . I'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and I'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. . . Just know what to order. . . The 18 Monk Noodle was so amazing. You don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. Our waiter suggested we opt for the Tuna Ceviche as opposed to the Ceviche Pargo and I could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. The tuna was so fresh. The soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. . . We also ordered the Queso Fundido, and the XO Scallops in XO Sauce. I wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and I don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. That was our mistake--but don't make it yours! A side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve GREAT, okay?. . After dollar signs kept racing through my head as I tried to figure out the damage, I wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her Mango Sticky Rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #YOLO . . Anyways, it was so incredibly good! It's not your traditional Thai-place-MSR by any means. It's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as I write this all I really want to do is drive down to the Cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. . . As far as the service, and given it was a Tuesday night, we got seated right away. Our waiter, Miller, was awesome! He didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and God bless him for it.
My wife's birthday dinner start off well. The items we ordered was amazing. The service was great until we got another server, he was very rude. At the end of our meal, kept us if we wanted to order more food. We said, no we're stuffed. He cleared our table and gave us our check without asking us if we wanted dessert. As we were getting ready to leave, he picked up the bill counted the money and didn't say anything to us. We won't be coming back to this place.
Ok food the waiter described the restaurant as tapas style but his was just really small portions and really overpriced. Not really fusion just sold both Mexican and Chinese food.  Their chinese street sandwich was delicious but it was tiny and would not pay $9 for that. Overall the dom dom mian was ok the sweet and sour soup was not good.
As a Vegas regular visitor I'd have to say this was easily in the top 3 most memorable and delicious lunches I've had on The Strip at any price point. We got the 18 Monk Noodle, Beef Sui Mai, Tinga Poblana taco, Pescado a la Plancha taco and Mango Sticky Rice and it was a nice sized meal for two. . . The Mango Sticky Rice was the standout - crispy rice puffs sprinkled over light fluffy cream, with ripe, cold mango chunks at the bottom. . There was a 15 minute wait for a table for 2 on a holiday weekend Saturday afternoon so very accessible.
Saw this place as we bumbled through the Cosmopolitan and we knew we had to have lunch here. I felt bad for the waitress, we had loaded up on one too many free mojitos at the slot machines, and were being extremely obnoxious. At one point, while laughing my face off, I called over a random busboy and told him that it was JLs birthday (it was not). The things I do for free cake. Then, while laughing my face off, JL said, "no, it's your birthday" (it was not). Let's just say that we did not get any free cake during our stay. The food was definitely not fusion. They had random items like guacamole, tacos, and dim sum. It all tasted pretty authentic, but the portions were small. I think about four tacos and a noodle bowl cost us about 40 bucks.
The food here was fantastic. It is designed to be eaten as small plate, family style dining, so we ordered 7 plates for 3 people for dinner. That was a perfect amount of food for the three of us (all girls, but one big eater!). Plus we split two desserts, but could have easily done one.  Everything was delicious, but the standouts were the golden pig steamed buns, Dan Dan noodles, mango sticky rice and the duck tongue tacos. . Cocktails were tasty. Reasonable for Vegas, although definitely pricey if you are going to eat a full meal with cocktails, mains, and dessert. . My one huge complaint was the service, and only very specifically in regards to the hostess. When we arrived, we checked in and were told without a reservation the wait could be 45 minutes to an hour, but since we were willing to sit anywhere that was first available (bar or table) usually something would open in about 20 minutes. We were escorted to the waiting area, and a server came by very quickly to offer us drinks. Then we were basically ignored for an hour and a half, when everyone around us (also without a reservation) was seated first, despite having similarly sized groups. When the hostess did acknowledge us, every time she promised that we were next to be seated and we were just waiting for a table to open up. Except that each time, she indicated a different table that we were waiting for.  When bar seats finally did open up an hour into our wait, she told us that we were just waiting for a table to leave - that they had already paid, and then showed another group to that table. When a table finally did open up, there was a huge miscommunication among the staff about who was going to get it, which arrangement and so on.  I feel like if we had not been persistent about being seated, we would have been completely ignored. . I wouldn't have been so cranky about the wait time if my expectations had been properly managed from the beginning-customer service 101. When, 40 minutes in, she kept telling us that we would be seated right away, we just got more irritated every time that turned out to be untrue. If we were honestly kept apprised of the situation, we likely would have elected to come back another night with a reservation. . Since we had been basically repeatedly misinformed, my friend asked if we could please have a complimentary guacamole for the wait. The hostess was super reluctant to help us and said she would have to ask her boss, but as soon as our server came to the table, the server offered to bring us some on the house. After we were in the server's hands, the dinner was fantastic. Food came out really fast and the servers were friendly and efficient.  The hostess was likely enough to keep me from returning, at least for awhile, and definitely not without a reservation. When I pay $180 for a meal, I expect to treated with at least honesty and courtesy by every staff member, especially the "face" of the restaurant.
Third time eating here as the tacos are all amazing and so is the Crispy Lace wontons! Haven't tried much else - worth the price compared to the pricier restaurants at the Cosmopolitan i have also been to. Salt air margaritas are great but have some drinks before you get here- they're 14 bucks each and are small!
Sat at the bar with a few friends and had some great drinks prepared by Sarah.  She was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  This was not my first trip to the restaurant nor will it be our last.  The salt air margaritas are excellent and although no longer on the menu the Oaxacan old fashioned is excellent.
Had an early dinner at China Poblano when I was in Vegas for a conference.  I enjoyed it - the duck tongue taco was awesome, as was a special of XO sea scallops and green beans.  I also enjoyed the cocktails and wines by the glass (and while the food prices were steep, I felt that the alcohol prices were reasonable, all things considered).  Service at the bar was good.
Always great. Based off the reviews I see, most people can't differentiate high end dining vs Taco Bell/Panda Express type food with Mexican and Chinese food. . . China Poblano is a high end restaurant. Top quality ingredients and almost everything is handmade. The concept is unique and the average person seeking utility tacos, burritos and enchiladas will be disappointed.
I am so disappointed with the food at this place. I ordered the carnitas and seta tacos and a side order of brussel sprouts.. . Everything was just drenched in oil and I'm pretty sure there was more of that than any other ingredient in my plate. I've been here two different times and its been exactly the same. Sorry China Poblano - I don't see what the hype is about.
This place is a must, when I come to Vegas. Its located inside tge Cosmopolitan hotel. The decore is modern Chinese/ Mexican influences art. .  It is side by side Mexican and Chinese dishes. Most of the dishes in the menu are meant to share. However, I love the Chilequiles so much, I get my own. They also have a great selection of tacos with traditional mexican flavors, as well as chinese inspired flavors.. I definatley recommend this place. Can't wait to go back
Loved the food (duck tongue tacos were the biggest and best surprise).  Sarah at the bar added to my enjoyment by her attitude and recommendations.
I was surprised how much I loved these tacos! I had the grilled fish taco and the short rib...both were BOMB! Gluten free corn tortilla, the corn is not dipped in flour so it's prefection!
