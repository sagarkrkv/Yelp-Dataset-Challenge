Were do I start everything was great. Greens and yams were on fire. Even the banana pudding omg. They bring the food to you. The place looks like a whole in the wall but don't let the looks fool you. This is the place in vegas for ribs. I didn't eat the ribs but everybody else did ...lots of meat
Went here for the 2nd time earlier this week. It's in an industrial area, a little off the beaten path. There was virtually no lighting in the parking lot, I wondered if it was open. The number of cars in the parking lot suggested it was and there was an Open sign with some other flashing signage so I went in.. . You order at a podium like desk. I had a Lehigh Valley IronPigs hat on, displaying a pig, and the order taker took a liking to it. I went with the brisket sandwich combo and ordered cole slaw (not the jalepeno cole slaw this time) as my side.. . Quite promptly my sandwich was delivered by one of the staff. Overflowing with tasty shredded brisket. The cole slaw was a nice compliment. I left stuffed.. . The place has a casual atmosphere, couples, buddies, and families.. . I'm glad I found this place and will definitely be back.
Can't say anything bad about this place. Got the rib platter. They were out of baby backs so it was mostly spare ribs with 1 beef rib. Couldn't finish it all because that is a lot of meat and fat for 1 meal. The side I chose was the greens. Bad choice for me because they were too spicy for my pallet and I couldn't eat them. But they were probably perfect, it is just me. Corn bread was very good too.
Saturday night in Vegas and we were planning on meeting up with our friends for dinner and some fun. The first place we planned to go to was not getting too many rave reviews.. Stephanie S. had the wonderful idea to come here instead for dinner. This place was pretty close to where we were staying on the strip, which made it easy drive for us. Located on the other side of the strip (yes on the seedy side of town) pass a couple of popular strip joints, made a turn thinking did my GPS give me the wrong directions because it's really dark on this street and it looks like it's the industrial area of Vegas. Well you are in the industrial area but it is also a mix of other business as well. Rollin Smoke is in a small shopping center look for a sign that says "Kiesub Center" and you have found it! Did I mention that they are open until 1:30 am every day too?. . As we were pulling into the parking lot, I notice two huge bbq smokers outside. Knowing that anything that is put into a smoker is going to be mighty tasty I was ready to order right there in the parking lot!. . Walking into this eatery the BBQ smell hits you like a mack truck on the 15. Their menu is large and in charge! . . Everything from an all you can eat BBQ for $24.99 (you get anything on their menu, anytime, any day of the week). . $7.99 sandwich's (like the pulled piggy, smoked brisket ECT). $8.99 meals (BBQ nacho fries, various wraps, outlaw burger and many options that are more wonderful to choose from). . Then there are the various plates that they have. Minh and I decided on ordering and splitting The Pit Special: . . Four meats (of your choice) and three sides (of your choice) - Brisket, Chicken, two orders of spare ribs. Bacon Potato Salad, Yams, and Corn Nuggets all for $19.99!. . They took Minh's name down and we seated our self's in an over sized booth. The owner was there making sure everything was running smoothly. This is a family owned business, which makes it have that charming-family-cozy kind of feeling.. As we were waiting for our food and other friends to arrive, I was chatting with Stephanie and watching the small eatery fill up with hungry families, club-goers and other various walks of life wanting some stick to your ribs goodness. . . A friendly server brought our food to our table. All I can say is the Pit Special offers a lot of food for your money! There is more than enough to share with another person. . . The corn nuggets were the best ever! Fried on the outside (no grease on any of the balls) and yet soft and fluffy in middle. I was popping these in two at a time (sorry babe if you only got a couple). There are addicting! . . The bacon potato salad was another favorite, chucks of potatoes various seasonings, mayo and probably mustard piled with bits of delicious bacon.  Swoon!. . All the meats were tender (they "rub" their own meats daily) you can taste the quality of the meats they have. Not one piece was dry; we did try their homemade BBQ sauce, which was delightful on the brisket. The chicken and ribs had so much meat on it I got overwhelmed for a second. . . This place is a gem in hiding, BBQ in sin city at its best! To the Holland family thank you for making this delicious food for every kind of budget!
4.8 stars  went ahead and rounded it to 5 . . . On a previous trip to Las Vegas, we drove past Rollin Smoke BBQ, and they had the smokers going but we want to give another place a try... that place was Memphis BBQ.  You can read my review about Memphis BBQ...  hind sight is 20/20 ... and oh how I wish we would have stopped at Rollin Smoke first.  Live and learn! . . The place smells great when you walk in the door... the guys, there were really nice and welcomed us in.... . The menu is diverse.... . I had the three meat plate...  brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. . . Brisket was really good... Ribs were even better... and the Pulled Pork was KILLER! . . Portions were generous... flavors were fantastic!  The potato salad had some spice to it and so did the pickles. . . My wife had two meats, pulled pork and brisket... she raved about both.  She is a huge brisket fan, and she said it reminded her of being in Texas.  She loved it! . . I think the guys there have a handle on the BBQ side of things... it's great! Where I think, they could use some help is in the dessert's area... they were just alright.  I wasn't there to have dessert... so not a big deal... but... it's the only weak link about the place which stood out to me.  Dial that in... it's a 5+ star place. . . Well worth a visit if you want fantastic BBQ!
I love Yelp... I found this hidden jewel because of Yelp.  It is tucked away. I love BBQ.  This place was outstanding. The food is authentic and very tasty. I had the Biggin sandwich which had brisket, pulled pork and sausage for $8.99.  The sandwich was large and sooo good.  It was full of meat.  The meat is very smokey and tender.  I was very surprised about the size of the sandwich for the price.
Definitely a great hole in the wall! We tried the all you can eat and it was well worth the $25! The staff was super friendly. Definitely recommend the spare ribs, loaded mash potatoes, and the shrimp.
I was in Vegas a few weeks ago and my friend Julie. Took me hear to try the food since I love BBQ. I must say the food was to die for. The staff and service was great. I've tried a few places in Vegas but this place is the Best by far! If your in Vegas I highly reccomend it!!
Ok by FAR the best BBQ I have ever had! Soooooo good! We got the pulled piggy sandwich, hot links, and the BBQ nacho fries all to share. All of it was delicious!! My favorite was the BBQ nacho fries. You HAVE to try them!! So good I can't even explain it! I'm so full I need someone to roll me the rest of the way home :)
After reading through the talk threads I kept seeing Rollin Smoke. I was convinced its time for some BBQ. As always there is a nice crowd inside and it's hard to get a table at times. We were luck to grab a seat in the side room. My wife and I split the 4 meat 3 side combo. We had the pulled pork, brisket and double spare ribs. Sides were hush puppies, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.the brisket was good but I enjoyed the pork and ribs mostly. Great smoke taste and I add a bit of the BBQ sauce for extra flavor. All the sides where great. Mac and cheese and hush puppies are where it's at! A bit small in here but great food!
If you're looking for good BBQ in Vegas, Rollin Smoke is where you're going to find it!. . Located in a small plaza on Highland, Rollin Smoke is a fairly small restaurant and gets crazy busy at times. When you walk in, there's a large menu on the wall and after you place your order, you can go sit down and they'll bring the food to you. The menu is somewhat large and features classics like pulled pork sandwiches and meat combo plates. They've also got some not-so-usual options like the gigantic Outlaw Burger, Chicken 'n Waffles and even an all you can eat option. . . I usually order a two meat combo with brisket and hot link. Most places seem to serve a packaged hot link and just toss it in sauce. While I have no idea whether there's is or not, it's one of the better ones I've had. The sausage is flavorful with a great snap and they don't douse it in sauce. Since I'm a fan of spicy food, I like that there's has a little kick to it as well. And there's a reason I can't stay away from the brisket either. It's extremely tender, flavor is great and it's not overly smoky. Again, even though I really like their sauce, they don't douse the meat in it which is a huge plus. You have to try the sauce though, it's slightly sweet but has a mild heat...really tasty.. . If you're into dessert, they have a few options there too. We've used the Yelp check-in for a free mini dessert a few times and always get the peach cobbler. My wife is a peach cobbler fanatic and this is her favorite in town. I've heard good things about the banana pudding though and I'll be getting that next time.. . This a solid 4.5 stars for me and only because I've had inconsistent plate sizes. One time I got a combo plate that had so much meat I couldn't finish it, but then the two other times we've went, I finished mine and starting picking off the wifeys. Not a huge deal but it's a bit irritating. Either way, Rollin Smoke serves some of the best BBQ in town and at much better prices then most of them too. Top it off with friendly service and you got a must try spot!
Here we go, brace yourselves. I'll be that guy. This is actually a friendlier version of my review for RSB; the original had cuss words and comparisons that probably would get me in trouble that's the version you needed to brace yourselves for.. . When it comes to BBQ, American BBQ, I've gone to St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas, the Carolinas, various states in the East, South, Mid-West, and West, pre-Yelp and current Yelp days, and have experienced both good and bad BBQ. You can say I've had more than my share of BBQ and can tell a good BBQ from just a decent BBQ place but no way am I an expert. I've hated BBQ spots locals loved. So IMHO and friendlier version RSB is just decent, OK is being nice. I've been here a few times and well I am NOT a fan. Each time I've been disappointed with one thing or another. Yes I've gone back but that's just cause everyone's been raving about RSB and I wanted to give them another shot and then another.. . One of my first visits was with a group of 5-6 from work. I don't remember what everyone exactly ordered but remembered me having the chopped pork sandwich and another having the chopped chicken sandwich which neither I can find on the menu, must have been a special. Anyways from both of the sandwiches we created a community pile of what's this!? tiny pieces of chicken bones. There were a lot of chopped up chicken spine and rib bones all mixed in our meats. Even if I was mistakenly served chicken with my pork, bones, really RSB. I had more typed out but I leave it as that. The only good thing about it was I had a free dessert with Yelp check-in. STRIKE ONE.. . After writing off RSB for a couple months the group made it back out. This time ribs and Outlaw burgers were ordered. They certainly took their time bringing the ribs out.  Ribs were ordered first and was last to be served. What exactly were they doing!? Warming it up or cooking them as it was ordered. I actually asked for and ate my dessert first cause I was hungry. The ribs that came out was beyond disappointing tough, rubbery, had little taste, and sucked. I've had way better.  I noticed my ribs were different from the others. Oh there's a "rib plate" and a "rib platter special". STRIKE TWO.. . After working up an appetite playing basketball all morning I came here looking to finally clear things up and getting the rib platter special. It was a lot of ribs but it lost all its luster. The beef rib wasn't as tender as I was hoping but tender to some liking. The rest were decent nothing exciting just a lot of meat covered in sauce. I smelt all the smoke inside and outside of the RSB but I got only a hint of smoke taste. STRIKE THREE. Throat slash. . . The best BBQ in Vegas!? I don't know about that. Maybe, than again Vegas aren't known for BBQ and the ones I've enjoyed no longer are open so maybe I don't know anything about BBQ plus I sometimes enjoy buffet BBQ ribs. You want more info there's AYCE BBQ for $24.99. It's located off a few side streets near the Strip. They have a small parking lot which is shared with the other businesses. They're from Arkansas. They're friendly but I wouldn't call the service great. There's large tables, small tables, and booths. Lines for ordering can form out the door. Just go if you like go.
OMG! Went to Rollin Smoke before the Clint Black concert.  Was easy to find due to friendly Yelper's directions.  The sexy smell of BBQ immediately welcomes you when you walk in the door.  Our order taker (sorry didn't get his name) determined the best combo when we told him what we wanted.  The corn bread was to unbelievably moist and delicious.  We would have ordered more for dessert with Blue Bell ice cream if we hadn't been so stuffed.  The beef ribs were huge and melted into smokey heaven in your mouth.  The brisket was plastic fork tender and moist.  You have to get corn nuggets - spicy fried creamed corned!  We were supposed to share but I ate more than my share!   They must be world famous as a large van of Aussies (in for Red Flag) filled up the place and took their orders to go!   The place has a lot of seating...can't wait to plan a lunch adventure for my co-workers!
My new favorite spot in Vegas for BBQ. They are a straight up BBQ spot, no frills no thrills. Food is fresh and the guys behind the counter are super cool and really nice. As a guy who normally visits Vegas frequently for work, I'll make this one of my stops from now on. I just wish they had beer, haha! Thanks guys..
SOOO Delicious!! Visiting Vegas from San Diego and I'll be back for sure. Brisket is delicious and the corn nuggets so good. Definitely check it out! Friendly staff as well.
So far the best bbq place I've ever been to here in Las Vegas! Mac and cheese good, kickin beans, and greens, bomb. Best local spot for great bbq!
The best BBQ in Vegas! Had the best BBQ pork sandwich, best hot Link, best fries, and best corn bread I've ever had in Vegas. Very good quality ingredients, expertly cooked, and reasonably priced. Im a regular Texas visitor too, and this still beats any BBQ I've found in SE Texas!!
This is a terrific BBQ joint in Las Vegas. I don't believe it is on par with Franklin BBQ or The Salt Lick in Texas, but this place does solid BBQ with LARGE portions. I base this review on only trying the brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and several sides. . . I will update the review once I try the ribs and other items. The beans were a bit too spicy for my taste.
If you like authentic BBQ this is your place!  We were greeted at the door by a very helpful server.  He gave us recommendations.  Everything we ordered was great. We shared the trio meat, hush puppies, Mac and cheese, a berry cobbler and 2 drinks all for under $25.   Yummy.  The restroom was clean and even had seat liners. It is an industrial location but don't be intimidated.
I was cravin bbq after driving by Memphis BBQ on the way home. We were going to head there, but after checking out the reviews on  Yelp I decided to try Rollin Smoke BBQ! Some of the best bbq I've had in a while that wasn't from a chain (Famous Dave's - which I 'm not knocking as I've had great food there as well). I would go out of myway for TC Rib Crib so I'm glad I found a place closer to home. . . This place is a little hard to get to but so glad we found it. I got the three meat platter with spare two spare ribs, pulled pork, and the FATTY part of the brisket with sides of cheesy mac and yams. The ribs were meaty and tender. Nice char on the meat, great smoky flavor! The pulled pork was tender as well. Great pork flavor. The fatty part of the brisket was killer! Nice burnt fat pieces with succulent strips of beefy goodness. They also threw in regular pieces of brisket which I didn't care for but took it home anyway. I don't care who makes it, I've never cared for brisket as I've always thought  it's a dry piece of meat. It was great cold the next day. The mac n cheese was creamy  enough, but even the extra cheese on top didn't make it "cheesy" enough. The yams were excellent. Lots of brown sugar cinammony goodness! The portions are large and come with a piece of Texas toast under the meats so it soaked up all the pork juices and was an extra added treat! My friend enjoyed his chicken and spare rib plate with jalapeno cole slaw and fried okra. There BBQ sauce is very good! Not too sweet, peppery and flavorul!    . . I take away a star because of the brisket and mac n cheese. I would have to try other things before upgrading to a 5. Great, friendly service and good food! I will be back!
pure bbq heaven! love them, fast services.. super nice! the best bbq in vegas
This place is all its cracked up to be! We looked up best BBQ in Vegas and after some debate/argument we agreed to eat here. Rolling up you might want to turn around, but dont! This place is the real deal! The inside is not that fancy, but who cares right as long as the food is legit. I would pride myslef as a BBQ snob and this joint hit all the marks. I walked up ordered the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, tri tip and ribs. Couldn't decide on the sides so just ordered some extras like okra, cole slaw, waffle fries and potato salad and boy was that a mistake afterwards. I needed to be wheeled out! This has to be one of the best BBQ joints I have been to outside the rib cook off in Reno and this place has every right to stand off to any National Rib Champion. What sealed the deal for me was the owner and his customer service. This guy was hustling all over the restaurant checking on tables making sure everyone had what they needed. They missed a side off our order and I offered to pay for it and he refused. At another table someone asked how good something was on the menu he brought them out a sample! This doesn't happen in most places today or the level of customer service. . Then to top it off we meet this nice family while we are eating and they talk us into sampling their banana pudding desert. At first I was like no way I to full then my daughters almost refused to leave before trying so I gave in. This thing put me over the edge but wow was it good! similar to ice cream pudding only fills the cracks when your full...well worth trying or taking some home. This is a must when your in Vegas!
This place is as good as it gets when it comes to BBQ. Not only is it authentic,  everything is fresh and fast! Everyone there is super friendly and Mike and the whole crew make you feel at home.  We actually came in when the Travel Channel was filming if that tells you anything. Highly recommended and five stars all around!
I have personally been here twice.....my husband and his friend more than that and every time he is anywhere near the place! It is bar none the best barbeque I have EVER HAD!!! The cook, the staff, everyone super friendly and everything I've eaten is to die for!!!
