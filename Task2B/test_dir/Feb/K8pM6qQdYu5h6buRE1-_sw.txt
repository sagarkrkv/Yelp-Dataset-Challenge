I had the best breakfast ever at Lo-Lo's. My husband heard about this place from one of his friends and we just had to check it out while we were in Phoenix from Virginia for a wedding. We are so glad we did, the food is A-m-a-z-i-n-g and the service is just as wonderful!  The waffles were some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant and the chicken was done just right! Yum! :) I wish we had better places like this in our area. We hope to eat here again next time we are in Phoenix! :)
A friend of mine kept talking about Lo-Lo's and how great it is.  Today, we went.  Wow, I have to agree.  We were greeted right away at the door.  Our waitress came over, introduced herself, and took us to our table.  Immediately, she asked what we wanted to drink, and brought out our drinks in less than a minute.  I had the vegetable plate.  The Fried Okra was good, but not as good as my wife makes.  The beans and rice were "OK".  I also had corn - delicious, and green beans - delicious, and a sweet cornbread (also delicious).  I can't wait to go back and try some more vegetables!
I've been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles, where it's the talk of the town for being the best in its speciality. For you locals that wish you could try it.... . ...go to Lolo's instead. . . This isn't hometown bias, either! Hands down, I prefer Lolo's. The chicken is cooked to crispy perfection and the waffles are fluffy yet flat and soft yet crunchy, all with a slight hint of cinnamon. I never go here without ordering a huge mason jar full of Kool-Aid. The sense of family in this newly-renovated building is great; I always feel right at home. Their Mac-n-cheese is great, too! Sometimes you can catch them making their food in the front window where they have all their ingredients and kitchen tools out for display. . . I promise you won't be disappointed. You'll leave with a super full stomach and a smile on your face.
Have been to this and the Scottsdale location several times. Good food and laid back atmosphere. Sometimes you might have to wait longer than you would like for a refill or to pay your bill, but generally the service is decent. . . I usually get the fried catfish plate with Mac n cheese and greens. Have also tried the waffle sandwich. Stepped outside the box once or twice and got the shrimp n grits and the salmon croquettes. Not impressed with either. Also wish they had peach cobbler.
Downtown location has been renovated.  It's gorgeous and roomy but definately seems to have been "Scottsdale-a-fried" (get it?); it just doesnt' seem right that LoLo's downtown location has "Valet parking." . . Since this is an update to my original review, I want to call out that I have a new menu favorite:  Stupid Fries -Hot seasoned fries topped with tender fried white meat chicken, gravy & onions, green & red bell peppers covered w/ cheese.  YMTS(f).. You. MUST. Try. Stupid fries. . Also - if it's a slow day, ask your waiter if the Chef will make you a Chicken Waffle Martini - if the stars are aligned, you will be rewarded with the most unique and delicious martini you have ever tasted.
Good food, but the worst service I've ever had. 65 minutes to get 5 orders of chicken and waffles and a catfish sandwich. Awful.
WOW! That is the one word that describes this place. Our last day in Scottsdale and we wanted to venture over to Phoenix for some soul food. I am so happy we found this place. Let's just say I have to unbutton my pants because my belly is full! Everything was great!
I loved it....  Waffles and Chicken.... What a concept!  I even had Kool Aid for my drink....  Mac n cheese, cornbread and more.....  This place is awesome and our group of 21 loved it!  A must try eatery....
Food was awsome.   The chicken and waffles were awsome.  A little slow coming out but turned out to be wort it.
Adefinite must! The food was great and prices were too. Called ahead for a group and they treated us like VIPs. As a Mac & cheese expert, make sure to have theirs, DELICIOUS. Wonderful.
Always good! Always clean! Best service from Jamal as usual! We drive up from Tucson just to come eat here! Wish we had one in Tucson. Stupid fries, waffles, chicken, corn bread, and Mac and cheese today, perfect!
The vibe here is cool, there's a DJ spinning records on Friday night. The food is more of a mixed bag. I got the chicken & waffles. The chicken was crispy, moist, and flavorful. The waffles were flat, I had to use all the butter and a lot of the syrup to add flavor. The potato salad was tasteless and had a whole bunch of paprika dumped on it.
Sat at the bar with my SO.  Great tunes, great energy, outstanding food.  Loved the collard greens, chicken and I had to have a biscuit.  Lovely staff.  Would go there every day if I was close by.
This was my first time trying chicken and waffles as a combo and must say that it was incredible! Service was extremely fast and friendly so I'll definitely be going back.
Stopped in here when we visited Phoenix.  Great food and lots of it.
I go once a year on my birthday.  I also know not to expect good or fast service at this location.  Love the food, never have room for dessert, and I go home and my clothes STILL smell like fried chicken.  ha ha ha, good stuff.
