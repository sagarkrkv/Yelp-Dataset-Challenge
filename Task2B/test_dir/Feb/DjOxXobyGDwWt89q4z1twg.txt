Not the biggest Ramen fan but this place is really good! My son had a pork belly bowl he loved it!
Craving ramen and deciding to be break-away from our normal habits, my boyfriend and I decided to try Monta, hearing so many good things about the place. We went on a Tuesday night and their small space was packed to the brim. We put our name on the waiting list and were seated in about 15-20 minutes of coming in.. . I decided to get the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. The food came out decently fast, even with how busy they were, so thats a plus. The food was absolutely delicious and I have nothing bad to say about it! But it kind of tasted like every other ramen I've had before so it wasn't anything special.. . Overall, this place is a great place to go when you're craving a good bowl of ramen but don't go on a busy night. The space is insanely small so you most likely wouldn't get seated for over an hour. The ramen is good but it isn't worth the wait.
I love this place ! Great service, food, and price. I definitely recommend this place if you love Ramen.
The restaurant is small and can be busy.  I had the tonkotsu ramen and it was very delicious.  The soup was delicious and the ramen noodle is different from what i've had at other ramen house.  It was thinner type of noodle and it was cooked perfectly.  Overall the ramen was great and would come here again.
Monta, according to one of my friends who lived in Japan, is as close to authentic Japanese ramen as you can get in Las Vegas. I'll take his word for it.. . The small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. Your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. There is a $10 minimum for card.. . The waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. They are friendly, but not overly so. Food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.. . My usual order is a miso ramen with corn. The main reason I get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. Many people complain about this but I never really felt the extent of Monta's salty broth until the past year or so. It just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. I'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.. . You get nori, chashu, and bamboo. Condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. One thing that used to bother me when I first started coming here was that they only have green tea iced and in a can. . . They also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. For recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. It's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but I am an avid eater of garlic.. . Regardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back.
Tonkotsu shoyu ramen. We could have this after the dinner. Too good to not to take it... Lol
Not bad, Monta Ramen... not bad at all. . . Three of my friends and I came here after a night dancing looking for some soup to appease our parched bodies. Here are some things you should expect: . . 1. Parking. Easy peasy. There is a big lot, so no need to worry about that.. . 2. The wait. Oh my goodness. We came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was ALREADY A LINE. This being said, I HIGHLY recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot Las Vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty. . . 3. The ramen. I ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. It was SO GOOD! The broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, I've been told that I have a salty palette.. to each his own.). The pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! My only regret is not getting extra. My boyfriend got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... I think his was TOO salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). Even thought my ramen was overall really good, I couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy/greasy in my stomach. I actually ended up with a small stomach ache after. . . 4. The service. Okay, I guess I have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took FOREVER to order/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ignoring us on purpose at first. Nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags. . 5. The value. SUPER CHEAP! Also, a coke was only ONE DOLLAH! To me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant... . . All in all, I recommend it. If you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, buttery or greasy, I'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish.
This is the first restaurant I go to whenever I visit Vegas.  No joke.  Me and my gf eat here as soon as I get off the plane, it's that good.  We first tried Monta before it received all of its well-deserved notoriety, and were able to get seated right away.  Not anymore; expect long lines until near closing time.  The atmosphere is very authentic, very small and very loud and simultaneously chill.  Service is excellent despite there being only two people working the floor at any given moment.. . I always order the miso ramen with extra chasu.  It used to be my favorite until I noticed that it got a little saltier in the last few months.  So I've switched to regular Tonkotsu.  What sets Monta apart, in my opinion, is the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the chashu, and the depth of the broth.  I consider Monta to be in the top 3 pantheon of ramen in the Western US, besting Daikokuya in Los Angeles and Hakata in Gardena.  You must try this place if you are in Vegas.
This is the spot for Ramen. My family and I travel from the NW part of Vegas near Summerlin when we want our fix. We always order the tonkatsu shoyu with thin noodles and it is never a disappointment. The place is super small which sucks for a large size party or one with little ones (our case). That means you have no choice but to wait for one of the 4 tables to clear and you find yourself awkwardly staring at the people to see who will be done soon. This is not a place to sit and chat. Just eat and go. It gets packed ALL the time. We had to put a system in place where we drive up, someone hops out the car, puts the name on the list, THEN we look for parking, and sit in the car to wait LOL. We tried a Ramen place up the street and it just did not compare with Monta. It was more spacious with less of a wait time but that didn't make up for the Ramen. We'd rather wait and let claustrophobia kick in at Monta because it is so worth it :)
Now this place is awesome, Great atmosphere! I feel like I am in a real Ramen house with all the hustle and bustle being around the small yet very effective kitchen. I got the Miso ramen and ordered a hard boiled egg. The broth was amazing, well seasoned and was not overpowering. The Ramen itself was cooked perfect and the chasu was melt in your mouth! The egg was like theicing on top. All the flavors came together in perfect harmony and was such a treat to eat. I have eaten here multiple times and is a place that I highly recommend! If you have family coming into town, this is definitely a place that you should bring them to. If you are coming to Vegas then this is also a place you should go and try, it is off the beaten path but it is worth it. Great place and will be back time and time again.
I had tried ramen two times before this. . I did not like it. At all. . So when my bf asked me to go with him here I was to be honest not so excited about it. . So I ordered gyoza and shared the pork belly bowl and told my bf to just order his ramen and I would try it. Omg! The ramen was awesome I think he ordered the shoyu (spelling?) ramen! I actually liked it. Will definitely get my own bowl next time :))). And the pork belly bowl ahhhhh my good it was soooo delicious. The gyoza which are usually my favorite were just ok. . Go eat ramen at monta ramen even if u haven't liked it in the past.
I have been going to a lot of ramen places lately, looking for the best ones.  Some have been amazing, some not so much.  This place was sort of in the middle.  It's very small, which is appropriate for a ramen shop.  Our party of three waited for about half an hour for a table on a Friday around noon, which was to be expected.  We were seated at the bar, which has a nice little shelf underneath to put your purses on.  =)  I ordered the miso ramen and added boiled egg (nitamago).  The first few bites I thought were delicious.  Then the saltiness becamea little too much for me.  I couldn't eat it all, and took about half of it home in a to-go container.  I had the rest the next day, and again, it was tasty but way too salty.  And I usually love salt.  I still ate it though.  Someone else in my party ordered the kuro ramen and loved it.  I'd go back, but maybe try a different flavor.
So this may be one of the better ramen places i've had in america (only have had in texas and vegas) but i've been to japan and had around 20 different bowls there. SInce japan, if i see ramen ill get it, only to relive that trip.. . Monta, i probably the closest to authentic ramen that i've had outside of japan. Their broth is rich and has the body that a good tonkotsu broth is suppose to. The chashu is very tender and soft, but still holds its shape and doesnt fall apart. Monta just has everything spot on.. . This is a definite visit when i visit Las Vegas again 5 stars!
Tonkatsu was nice. Little creamy. The Kimche rice was delicious with the red ginger but the miso soup was so salty we couldn't finish it. Alright place for ramen.
Make sure to go over the specials.  I missed my chance to have spicy tonkatsu but it's okay, cause the regular tonkatsu was PERFECT.  . . The garlic oil ramen was amazing as well.  I kept stealing spoonfuls from my boyfriend's bowl. . . Definitely going to come back here every time I'm in Vegas.  Def going at 5PM because we were able to get seats quick!
Short: Everyone in Vegas, local or traveler, should go here. Best ramen I've ever had (and I've had a lot).. . Long: I'm a very critical person who isn't impressed very easily. Most of my reviews on Yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. This is worth 5 stars. . I went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. It's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. Get here when they open if you don't want to wait.. We ordered their specialty Tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). Noodles were packaged, but very good. The roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. The rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and green onion helped the ramen nicely. What makes it all go together was the soup stock. Amazing. . On top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. Not too cheap, not too expensive. And worth every penny.. . Like other reviews compare, the only contender to Monta Ramen is Sora Ramen. I suggest Monta first, definitely. I believe it's on an entire different level than Sora. But, Sora's extra cost does get you more: Thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.. . Second visit: Still amazing. Had the mini mentaiko bowl. It was good, and a nice side.. Third visit: Still amazing.
