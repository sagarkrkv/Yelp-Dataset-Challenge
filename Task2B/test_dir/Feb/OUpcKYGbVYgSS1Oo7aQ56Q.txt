I along with 2 other people stayed here in the Carson Tower Deluxe double bed room. The casino smelled like smokey soapy air (not bad, better than just smoke) so we were scared that our room may smell like that as well. First we checked in at the self check-in kiosk. Our room was on the 10th floor and as soon as the doors opened from the elevator we smelled no sign of smoke! we were so happy, the entire floor smelt clean and was tidy. Then we got to our room it was pretty nice, very clean. We had a clean, smoke free environment right on Fremont street. The parking structure was easy to get in and out. We also ate at the buffet on Sunday morning $22 champagne included. everything was good service was great and we were seated right at the wall of windows overlooking the pool. I loved that we could see the water slide and the fish swimming in the tunnel! Check-out was easy too just head back to the kiosk and your out in a jiff.. . Thank you golden nugget for a great time! I will be back!
We stayed at the golden nugget, feb. 8,9,10, five of us. It took us awhile to figure it . out , their slot machines don't  pay nothing, absolutely nothing. Nothing to keep. you around, not even little something's  to keep you playing. Well, we just ambled. out the door to greener pastures and slot machines that weren't so tight. We're from. out of state, just thought of giving people heads up.
I was surprised at how updated The Nugget is now! Looks good and got a modern facelift.. . The Pool is the Crown Jewel here in my opinion, hands down. . . Even the Casino Floor restrooms are super nice and very clean. . . My only gripes are the Valets are not very organized (one guy told us to pull up one place and then walked off and then another told us something completely different); The girl working the Ticket Sales needs to get a personality, she seriously came across as the most indifferent, inconvenienced human being on the planet and it seemed like every word she spoke to us was agonizing; The smoke was just overwhelming, you can smell it the minute you walk in the door and my clothes smelled like smoke the rest of the day from just being in the lobby to buy show tickets!
I really wanted to like the Golden Nugget as it is literally walking distance from the World Market Center. I did walk it once.. . I gave the hotel 2 tries because it is so convenient when attending a furniture market and I would love to see the reviviification of downtown Vegas happen.  But I had multiple room problems and the GN mgmt kept having to move me from room to room, till I said 'no more.'. .  If I stay again:. -In the Rush Tower, I will book a high floor NOT facing Fremont St. Otherwise the noise and reverberation is unbearable--despite soundproofed windows etc.. -Carson & Gold Towers--they only have wired Internet & it costs extra. Forget about using your Macbook Air unless you have a mobile hotspot with you. . -Unfortunately they really jack up their room prices during the furniture markets, so I probably won't be able to afford the Rush Tower room, anyway. They upgraded me to one because of my previous awful experience at the hotel, but it was overlooking Fremont St. and I couldn't sleep at night. -Carson & Gold Tower rooms have no desk, just a little table--difficult for working. -Carson & Gold Towers have sewer line problems. The sink in my Gold Tower room became completely backed up with sewage. The Carson Tower room had extremely slow drainage in sink and shower as if it was about to back up any minute. I would say that those two buildings need completely new sewer lines or major major sewer work.. -Safe malfunctioned in Gold Tower room and they wouldn't fix it unless i gave them a 1-1/2 hour window waiting in my room for someone to come fix it,  which I couldn't do. -Choice of food in the hotel is low quality unless you spend really big bucks at that steak house. -My coffee is important to me--I noted that the Rush Tower room had free coffee the Carson & Gold require you to pay $10 for a box of Keurigs to use their pot. -The Fremont Street Experience is really honky tonk and not someplace a single woman should wander alone in the evening. Dining out there is awful too. . -I like that the elevators in Carson and Gold Tower had NO music playing. . -I found the people at the front desk and the rest of the staff very helpful and accommodating through all my travails at their establishment. Too bad the room experiences were pretty horrible
We were here for 3 days and had 3 rooms....if we could have left after the first night we would have! One room had both the shower and the sink back up, our pillows smelled like perfume, and the toilet when flushed made a loud screeching sound....awesome...not to mention the clump of long black hair on the floor....beautiful, then engineering coming to the room in the morning and telling me that he thought the room would be on fire based on my message to engineering...besides the terrible waits and lack of service at the restaurants.....I alsohad to endure horrible customer service from the front desk when they charged me wrong.  Chelsea at the front desk was impatient, snippy, and down right rude.  I complained about this to the assistant Manager, Bryan Cruz who apologized profusely but I strongly think that my issues aren't going to be acknowledged by anyone.  Stay at a motel 6 before your come to this "hotel"-trust me!!
I love this place. I have only been here once but I plan on making this hotel my choice when visiting Vegas. I usually stay at MGM or Caesars but after staying at the Golden Nugget one time I was blown away. Great service and services.
Close to downtown if that is where you need to be.  Cheap room.  Terrible food from room service, raw steak full of grizzle.
We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and stay exclusively at the GN; rooms are clean, staff friendly, great restaurants on property and location is perfect.
GN is my favorite downtown hotels. I like that it has 2 Starbucks, that it's right in the middle of downtown and that it is the nicest hotel in downtown. I like the rush tower if it's just the hubby and I but with the kids, I prefer the gold tower. I normally don't win here so I don't gamble here. Claim jumper should be opening soon so I will have to try it when I go back.
Pros: Great customer service, clean big room, top notch pool with shark aquarium, relative low cost rooms without strip fees, walk out to Fremont Street. . Cons: No free Wifi, smokey casino. . I expected the casino's to be smoke filled. The hotel was great. The hotel looks refreshed and modern. Will visit again. I really want to say the customer service was great. Genuine and not forced smiles. I appreciate the dealers took time to give advice on craps, didn't make me feel like an ass when I made mistakes. I felt like I was on vacation and my wife love it too.
Review #10. . No one at Carson Tower front desk at 12am.  This is Vegas. Should be 24 hrs. Hotels in small towns have 24hr service.  You have to go to Rush or Gold Towers to check in to Carson Tower then haul your luggage back over again to Carson.. . Room shower doesn't work & no rooms left. Waiting on maintenance since 1:25am & its now 1:57am.  . . So far not looking good.  Not worth 1 star so far.. . Room view is nice of moon & strip.  . . But no shower water!  I'm tired & on DC time in Vegas. So my body clock is at 5am even though its 2am Vegas! . . I have a friend's wedding to attend in 12 hrs & need sleep & a shower before the wedding.. . Update:  shower working but water still dripping badly when you turn it off, no matter which way you angle water knob.  I told front desk this but no maintenance ever came to fix it.  . . I will give some good points though & up the stars to 2.5 for the rest of the hotel, not the room & extra charges for tea & coffee, Internet use ($12.99 for 24 hrs- quite outrageous when other hotels include free Internet), & $4 for a small bottle of water.  Go to Walgreen's 2 blocks from hotel to buy water, noise for construction, since I'm a nice person, & hate to give bad reviews.   . . The location is great for Old Vegas & you can walk out of the hotel to Fremont Street which is crazy, but a must see.  The restaurants & bars inside the hotel are wonderful & the famous, largest "Golden Nugget" is showcased here.. .  I'll write more later, but I must go run errands.
A very classy Establishment..I'd go as far as saying one of the best in Vegas..Rooms are always, always, clean and wonderful...the lounge and pool areas are classy and immaculate..Definitely a great value for what you get! They also give you a nice fun book that has lots of coupons and discounts..When I decide to stay downtown, this is my go to hotel!  I truly wish that they were on the strip!
This place was very nice! The atmosphere was very happy and friendly! I recently visited the Golden Nugget on Fremont when I visited Vegas in Feb. 2014! For the first time ever! It was very nice clean, would definately go back again soon!
Ahh, the Golden Nugget, we had our ups and downs during my 5-night stay, but overall you treated me very well. I really dig the more down-to-earth, old school vibe of Downtown Las Vegas compared to The Strip, and the Golden Nugget is the nicest and most complete casino in the area. Many components come together to make a full casino experience, so I'll review each of the components individually.. . The Rooms: Unless you are spending a lot of time in you room - and this is Vegas, so you shouldn't be - a basic room is the way to go. And their basic room in the Carson Tower is nice. Ample space, nice TV (that I hardly turned on), a good bathroom, and clean with upscale decor. No free internet is a minus, but even after paying for internet, the rooms averaged out at $65/night including taxes and resort fees. However, they were doing work on my floor that week - running new phone/internet cables - and the noise woke me up multiple times. (Yes, I was sleeping until 11AM, but I mean, this IS Vegas) I know casinos never close and this was probably factored into the cost of my room, but I could have stayed at another place Downtown for cheaper with no construction. 3.5 Stars.. . The Casino: This is the most complete casino in the Downtown area. Their Poker Room is a bit old school, but still nice. The dealers there are generally nice, fun people to be with, and there is a nice variety of people coming in. Tournaments are run three times a day. If poker isn't your thing, they have a load of slots and table games throughout the casino, including both poolside and in their lounge where live music is frequently playing. Regardless if I am staying here or at another Downtown casino, it's a given that I'll be gambling here. 4.5 Stars. . Restaurant Selection: Golden Nugget is owned by Landry's, who owns such posh restaurant chains like M&S and Morton's, so it's to be expected that they do high-end well. The problem is that most people staying Downtown are looking for value. I'm sure Vic & Anthony's and Chart House are good, but those aren't places for an "everyday" meal. The Grotto is pretty good - it's not cheap eats but it is moderately priced and a good value for what you get. I thought the Happy Hour specials at Red Sushi were good. But for late-night eats your only option is The Grille, a small counter-service establishment. It was decent, but you don't get that classic Vegas 3AM dive/diner experience. 3.5 Stars. . That averages to a just under 4-stars, and I'll jump them up to 4-stars for genuinely nice and efficient customer service and an excellent pool area that allows one to get some rest while nursing a hangover after you have checked out and are waiting for your flight. (For example) . . If you are looking to experience the value and classic vibe of "Old Vegas" but with a touch of class you get from The Strip, Golden Nugget is the way to go.
Sigh. I've stayed at Golden Nugget several times. My experience is never consistent. I generally opt for Rush Tower because of their big bath tubs but if your on the Fremont Street side of the hall the room is very loud. This last time we stayed in the Carson Towers. My main irritation is that after my friend and I left the Golden Nugget this time (we stayed two nights) we were both covered in bites! I had 10 different bites all over my body and my friend had 20! After we notified the Golden Nugget their incident report representative did not take our concerns seriously. Saying that they did not find any bed bugs, that no one else has complained so there's no way we got the bites from the hotel. All I can say is I don't know where we both got 10-20 bites all over our bodies from- maybe it's something in the air. . . Plus of Golden Nugget is the pool- kind of small but the shark tank is neat.
I was looking for a cheaper place to stay on this trip because I had just gone to Vegas last month. This trip was to pick up my in-laws as they were visiting friends in town. Looking around, I found a great package deal from Orbitz that included 3 nights stay for two rooms and an SUV from Hertz. All for $500. . . Valet parking was quick and efficient. The front doors aren't automated, so you have to manually hold the door open if you have a lot of stuff to lug around. Checked in to the hotel, and the front desk girl was fine. Really no chit chat, just all business. Not super friendly like most of the strip hotels, but not rude either. Almost impersonal. We were given two adjoining rooms with double beds in the Carson Tower. This is where it got crazy. I know Vegas hotels are huge, but didn't expect it in downtown. Our rooms were literally the furthest you can get from the casino floors. But I guess for the price I paid, I expected a not so great room. But that was a trek to the room! Seriously, why aren't there two separate banks of elevators. I counted...after the elevator ride, i turned a corner 5 times!. . Rooms were clean, but too much open space. I feel like there should be more furniture or something. Clean beds, clean bath, flat TV, really nothing more you can ask for except maybe a mini fridge.. . Casino floors were very busy, and very smoky. Typical of downtown hotels due to their low ceilings. Lost money here. Construction around and outside hotel, so beware of that. Also, they charge for non-guests to park on property, which is a bit odd. Also there are 2 starbucks on site, but hit up the Dunkin Donuts at Fremont for better coffee. You can get Starbux anywhere.. . Probably won't stay here again. Downtown scene is not for me.
This was my first time in Vegas. . I got a great package deal from Expedia for flight+3nights for 2 people at GN for $550 so I cannot complain, we got what I paid for. . I got a great deal and  GN is a decent place. It is not the strip, so don't expect it to be a nice high-end place. . . A lot of older, older, folks stay here, but I did see a lot of kids enjoy the pool as well, so over all it is a family friendly place. (Which confuses me because Vegas is not for kids, I mean there are naked pictures of strippers all over the ground when you step out on Freemont St or go to the strip).... . If you cannot afford to drop $1,600 for the strip I would say the GN is one of the nicer places on Freemont to stay. . Cab rides to the strip are $20 bucks. Cab ride from the airport to the hotel is $30, but if you catch a shuttle I think it was $25ish for two people. . If I could do it over again: Stay one night at Caesar's Palace and call it a day. . 4 days in Vegas was too long for us.
