A recurring theme seems to be the long wait associated with coming to Bianco and my experience was exactly the same. We were initially told that it would be an hour and 15 minute wait, probably less. We hesitantly agreed to wait since we drove so far to try this place. An hour and 40 minutes later we were seated. Did they rush to take our order? No. Was the taste of the pizza worth the wait? No. They did however give us a free order of antipasto and took off the cost of the salad we ordered which was a nice gesture but didn't make up for the wait. The food is good. Not great. Definitely not worth the wait. But if you can get in quick, give it a try. If you're visiting the Flagstaff area, Pizzicletta is much better and, although very small, will yield a shorter wait.
Echoing a lot of other reviews - it's definitely a bit overrated and the wait can be insane (even with a reservation; I can't imagine trying without one).. but it's still a fun and memorable experience with pretty good pizza and wine.. . If you go, I definitely recommend going with a group of ~8-10 people and making a reservation well in advance (I've never been for lunch but I've heard that it's more feasible for that). . . There's a nice beer and wine bar next door (which, I assume, strategically at least doesn't mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated).. . As long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience, I don't think you'll be disappointed.. . The biggest shame for me is that they don't have patio seating (in Phoenix it's nice enough for that almost year round). That said - it's a beautiful and central location, and if you go when it's a bit chilly out (by Phoenix standards), you probably won't mind eating inside.. . I can't bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review (mainly because they're so overrated) but I can say that other than the waiting (which is part of the experience if you're with the right people and not in a rush), I've never been disappointed or had a bad time there. Definitely recommend trying it out at least once.
Came here first thing off the plane for my first visit to Phoenix. Had heard about this place from a lot of the food channel shows.. I tried the Wiseguy. It was delicious. Being a New Yorker I can be very picky about pizza. This place was hitting the spot. Just a great crust and a perfect balance of ingredients.. I would come here often if I were any closer. Loves this place!
We were lucky because the wait was only 20 minutes for two on a perfect February day! When we arrived, our hostess was a little short with is, but we brushed it off. Finally when we got our table there was some confusion with another couple who thought it was actually their table. Again, another weird thing we brushed off. . . Our waitress was so nice and very helpful! We got the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy and split them. It was a lot of food, but we were both starving and it was just enough! They were both delicious! I would not wait 3 hours for them though. Max 30 minutes.... . Overall I think the atmosphere is great as the food is yummy too!
Found this place quite some time ago when they first opened up at the town and country plaza in Scottsdale and fell in love with the atmosphere, service and food. It is all so authentically Italian. The food is amazing - all made fresh there and the pizza is to die for, as are their gnocchi, chocolate cake and coffee. Service is friendly and responsive. The atmosphere is great as well. There is inside and outside seating and it is all set in a rustic theme. . . This is our go-to restaurant whenever we are down in the valley. You will not be disappointed!
Now, an old favorite in downtown Phoenix, Pizzaria Bianco is always a solid choice if you have enough time to really enjoy the experience. Start by putting your name on the list and having a drink at the wine bar next door. And then, enjoy your dinner.
I don't really get it. Better pizza at the Parlor and other places in the valley..... . However, it is an institution. If you go, get the Rosa pizza (red onion, pistachio).  Also, go on either 1) Halloween or 2) whenever it rains (which doesn't happen much in Phx), as this mercifully cuts down the lines.  I'll take visitors here but that's about the only time I'll go.
I can't say much more than what's already been said in 800+ 5 star reviews.. . I prefer Neapolitan style pizza with the simplicity of a few quality ingredients.. . If you come here with the typical Italian-American style pizza in mind -  thicker crust to support all those ingredients piled on top - then you will be disappointed.. . The place reminds me of Gusta Pizza in Florence Italy - small, quaint and delish.. . And people - stop bitching about long wait times... seriously.
This is great pizza.  Aromatic, hot, quality ingredients.  People are going to hate me for this however in my opinion  there are certainly better or equivalent pizzas out there both here and certainly in NYC, ORD, SFO . This may seem picky but I find the outside crust is better when a bit less dry, for lack of a better word.  The crust IS delicious and the outside of it puffs up etc...it simply seems to lack a bit of chewiness along with the outside crunch,.  The ingredients are good though as is the sauce.  I typically like a more oily pizza The rest of the menu is good too but equivalent to other places I've been.  I agree Cibo is a great alternate plus they have a nice outdoor seating area..
The pizza is good and the atmosphere is unique.  Not wait for 4 hours good, but def wait 30 with a glass of wine.  Make sure you ask for the bread with olive oil.  The oil is delicious!
On the one hand, I miss the old days when Chris made each pizza himself (or at least still lived in the US)..but on the other hand, the pizzas here on a visit last month were as exceptional as ever (and better yet, there was no wait at lunch on a Tuesday). Sure, you can get a quality Neapolitan-style pizza lots of places now, but Pizzeria Bianco remains the touchstone and I can't think of a better meal anywhere than a Sonny Boy and a Wiseguy here accompanied by a bottle of dry Lambrusco. Bravo.
Wow. Awesome place. Small - great casual atmosphere. Great local beer in tap (didn't catch the name). Started with the Spiedini appetizer. We contemplated ordering a second dish of it as it was so good. The came the pizza. We ordered the wiseguy - with mushrooms. It was phenomenal. The one pizza was more than enough for the two of us. Highly recommend this place!  You won't be disappointed.
What to say about Bianco that hasn't already been said? The ingredients are fresh, the ideas are creative and the execution is flawless. We waited for about 30 minutes next door in "Bar Bianco." Basically taking our apps in a different building. No big deal and a comfortable way to wait. Once shuffled over to the main house, we enjoyed three pizzas: Margherita, Rosa and Biancoverde. All were exceptionally done. My favorite was the Biancoverde with ricotta and arugula. The Rosa is complex and not a universal crowd pleaser, for some the rosemary and onion can be overpowering. I liked it tho. But you have to try a selection to pick your favorite.  One little detail I love is the use of Futura font on their menus and t-shirts. Very Wes Anderson. Is it the best pizza in the country, probably not but the best in the region is an easy title to bestow.
Really good pizza. The restaurant is very small so unless you get there when it first opens for lunch you will probably have a wait to be seated. Also the tables are all close together so don't expect to have a private conversation. . . Parking is valet and you are charged. I forgot the fee but it's nominal. The lot is very small so again, give yourself some time if you need to find another parking area. . . Don't let the wait discourage you. It's worth it!
Not worth the wait or the attitude. Do yourself a favor. Skip it.
Excellent pizza, my wife did not like it as much as I did, had the godfather pizza.  Worth the try if you have not gone before.
A very big disappointment. All the reviews I had ever read gave this pizza 5 stars. What a joke! The crust was cracker thin, the tomato sauce was heavy paste with no flavor or spice, and the cost was ridiculous. $18 for a personal pizza about 8 inches. Don't recommend this place to anybody, they will be totally disappointed. However, the atmosphere was nice.
Lunch here was rely pretty good, lite flavor not too heavy and great crust. Again it's not American pizza but a traditional Italian fare. . . The bartender advised me to get 1/2 of their 2 most popular and it was a great choice. I very much enjoyed my meal. Large detractors were the wait-the food is really good, but the fact that they have out door seating as large as the main restaurant and don't seat it is stupid. Also they don't have enough help. The staff was great and very knowledge-but they were running around like the possessed. They need more staff to handle everything. Now I did come in at an off time but it still speaks to a great idea poorly executed based on how the food was delivered. . . Had they taken care of the few issues I easily could rate this higher.
It was everything the press, the web and others had promised!
Great pizza and ambiance. Worth the wait...?... I've had better.
Great food and ambiance. Pizzeria Bianco will always be my favorite location.
OVERRATED......This pizza is not great by any means. Am I a pizza snob? Absa-frickin-lutely I am!! Born and raised in Chicago, I am super picky. Oprah should be ashamed of herself for choosing Pizzeria Bianco as the best pizza in America. Now, I won't be completely unrealistic. The pizza is by no means terrible. It's tasty. But when you think of pizza, do you envision arugula or prosciutto on it? NO! I envision pepperoni with grease droplets and sausage or mushrooms. Yes, I like deep dish...Yes, I like NY style and fold it over and stuff it in my face....Gourmet Pizza?? The two words should never be in a sentence together and if they are, RUN!!!
Very good pizza- very small portions, but that is somewhat expected in this type of place.. . The location and atmosphere is my favorite part, I think. It's in such a cute, vintage little building with a lovely park and center surrounding it. The outdoor seating and indoor seating are both comfortable, though inside it is a little cramped. . . I love the white pizzas ( I can't remember the name, but it doesn't have traditional marinara-type sauce) and they have great salads, too.. . They are pricey- if I remember about $16-20 per person, and I didn't get full.. . BUT it is a great experience and everyone should at least TRY it. Cute for a quiet date night or lunch treat.
there is a lot of "hype" surrounding this restaurant.. pizza was good... we had fun drinking while we waited(which was a long time but we expected it and made a night out of it).. glad we tried it... can check it off the list.. won't go back.
This place was good but I am not sure what all of the hype was about on tv. I expected the pizza to be the best I've ever had. It was decent pizza. I don't think I would wait hours like sometimes the wait is. . It's confusing when they tell you to wait next door too. Needs to be explained what that is.
Good pizza, served with a side of pretentiousness.  . . . From the downcast look "nooo, we don't have pepperoni" to the quick "hey, you got to order something beyond drinks if you hang out at the bar".  .. . . . It is good pizza.  Nice solid crust, crispy, and fantastic and unique ingredients.  Yet the place isn't Tru or Gary Danko or Aliena.  So for good pizza, yes. . .but that is it.  It still isn't as good as Frank Peppe (CT) and that is served with over a 100years of experience.. . Our two pizza's were great  A olive and salumi pizza that was pure goodness.  The next was some sort of white pizza "are you sure you want a white pizza x10" was equally impressive.. . The beer selection was anemic (with one local draft and a few bottles).  The wine selection fared even better.. . If you don't want a pizza , don't eat here.. . Certainly not a bad place.  . . should be easy to cut the attitude.
As a New Yorker, I have really high pizza standards. And this place is fantastic!
Was the pizza good? Yes of course it was. Was it the best in the world like as the critics say? No, no it wasn't.  If I hadn't eaten pizza in Italy, or elsewhere in Europe maybe I would not of known better. Ambience of the restaurant is hipster in nature. Food is expensive, along with the drinks, at least they serve real Coke (made with sugar and not corn syrup) in the bottle with no refills.   Service was good.
This did not meet my expectations as per the reviews... Great potential, but I will not ever enjoy the taste of burnt cheese on my $18 pizza..
Pizza ok and definitely not worth the wait...NO TAKE OUT SERVICE really guys come down off your HIGH HORSE.
Good, but not "knock your socks off" pizza. Perhaps my expectations were too high, considering I have been wanting to come here for years. I tried the margarita, which is generally how I evaluate a pizza. Tomato sauce was tangy and delicious, fresh mozzarella was creamy and good as well. Crust had great consistency, char and structure, but lacked flavor. All in all, enjoyable experience, but I left feeling let down considering the hype.
Very limited menu allows them to concentrate on the pies they make. Valet parking is 3 bucks... we chose to park an walk half a block. Great service and food.
Simple and perfect.. . If the lines an issue go to Peter Piper or grab a Totino's from Basha's
I was worried that with all the hype, this place wouldn't live up to my expectations. I've been here a couple times now and am not disappointed with it at all. Best pizza I've had in Phoenix BY FAR. Service was great, crust was perfect, toppings were fresh and creative. Definitely worth going back.
