I just finished a week stay at the Palazzo for the first time.  My agent asked if I wanted to book a room on the concierge floor and I decided what the heck. After working all day, it would be nice to wander down in very casual clothing to lounge with a drink and some snacks.. Check in was a breeze and the room was clean and in good repair. I asked for a mini fridge for medication and although it looked as though it had survived life in a frat house, it was adequate and I wasn't charged additional fees- unusual for Vegas where EVERYTHING costs more.. The beds are pillow-topped and very soft. People with back issues beware. I asked the concierge if there were firmer beds and he arranged for housekeeping to insert bed boards between the mattress and box spring which helped tremendously. My main bitch- and this is with hotels in general- is the lack of fitted bed sheets. Those flat f@@kers never stay tucked in which IMHO affects the entire sleeping experience.. Housekeeping was accommodating and I agree with an earlier review that the towels are in dire need of replacing.. Room service was expensive and okay. The best was the shrimp cocktail, the crab cake and the Caesar salad. I worked my way through the menu 7 nights bc I became ill halfway through my stay :(.... So FYI the chicken noodle soup was tasteless.. The gaming floor was never very crowded.... Kind of indicative of the current economic climate. But I liked that they offered complimentary gaming lessons during slow times which can help a timid or unskilled player have more fun. Carpeting on the gaming floor looks like it's due to be changed. Smoke level was moderate.. I was able to check out on the concierge floor as well as print out my boarding passes. WiFi worked well in my room which enabled me to keep up on my work.. All the bellman were courteous and efficient. I left Super Bowl weekend and there were several repairmen on my floor tidying up before the huge influx of people. They were also very courteous and friendly and conscious of how much noise they were making. My floor-23 was probably the quietest floor I've ever been on in Vegas. Perhaps it was just luck.
I am practically a local since I've gone to Vegas about a million times. Even the smallest suite is pretty large. Always get a complimentary  upgrade when I'm in town. This hotel is very gorgeous and thank god it's so close to Tao. Very clean, staff is very helpful and always teach me the tricks of the trade.
Years of visits and never disappointed. Every employee seems to be eager to help and serve. Never seems like they are too busy to help. I'm amazed that they do everything so well on such a large scale. Rooms are large, location is great. Concierge level "Prestige" includes breakfast, dinner snacks and open (premium) bar from 5-7. Recommended if your into that sort of thing.
The Palazzo is amazing.  It is a little pricier than the venetion, but it has pretty much the same amenities.  The rooms are almost identical, except that in the Palazzo everything seems to be gold plated (bling, bling)!  Staff is awesome and extremely accomodating.
The new addition to Venetian and its sister property, Palazzo is located on the northern side of the Las Vegas strip. Fantastic scents line the hotel and casino as you make way through this large property. . . Rooms are great, service is excellent, shops are definitely among the best in the world with the Grand Canal just next door. Dining options are plenty as well. Since its a bit north of the lower Vegas casinos, its a bit more upscale and less shady.
Accommodated me checking early at 8am. All suites in this hotel. Mine included 2 queen beds, living room, dining room, personal printer copier scanner, and a tv in the bathroom. Very nice place with lots of shopping, dining, and entertainment attached to hotel.
Awesome vibe and very handy that it is connected to the Venetian! Central location was great. Very friendly customer service and maid service. I would definitely recommend it!
The palazzo is a great place to say. They have great free valet parking. The only confusing part was when the bill came our friends stayed an extra night but instead of charging them for the room in which the room was under there name they charged my credit card in which my name was not on the room. This was very unfortunate and inconvenient as I did not give them an ok to do this. We love Las Vegas so we will be back we probably will not stay here again tho. Rooms are beautiful.
Love this hotel and The Venetian.  Stayed here several times in the last 3 years.  I always love going to the pool.  Morels Rest. has excellent stakes and great wine selection.  The lobby is beautiful and connection to the Venetian makes the walking experience great.  The beds are comfortable and the bathroom are big. . . TIP TIP TIP;  When going from the Airport to your Hotel on the Strip...tell the taxi guy to NOT take the Interstate...take back streets - you get there faster and cheaper.
I've stayed at a few hotels in Vegas and The Palazzo has to be my favorite. It's the best of every world...perfect location on the strip with easy access to the Venetian (it's connected) so you have direct access to restaurants, clubs and casinos in both hotels, not to mention access to the Venetian's many pools which is AWESOME. What can I say about the rooms? Well, all of the rooms are suites and they are just gorgeous and VERY clean. Lots of space with a comfy living area for chill out time. Can't wait to visit the Palazzo again!
