I frequent Vegas pretty often and have to say that XS has NEVER done me wrong. I have an awesome promoter and love this place. During Night Swim in summer, it is literally one of the craziest/ dirtiest places to be. But without fail, I always have a great time at XS.
XS is my favorite club in Vegas no question.. . Awesome talent.. Decent prices.. Room to party.. . Buy pre-sale, get there at a decent time and enjoy your wild night.
If you're going to do a Vegas nightclub this is the spot. If you have a group of friends getting a table is the way to do it. . . This venue is beautiful, nicely ventilated, and the couple times I've been the music had been great. It's not all douchey or overcrowded like a lot or spots I've checked out. . . Saw RL Grime there this Monday and he was awesome. That trap music is really hot. . . Yah it's expensive to do one of these nights, but if you like to dance you should factor it into your budget, and go with a fun group. Come when there's a good DJ and try to negotiate a deal ahead of time.
Why do I always come to XS in the dead of winter? I give XS 4 stars for its outdoor pool area, but 3 stars for the indoor area. The indoor area, though comfortably insulated with just the right volume of EDM, does not give the swankiest impression.
Went for the first time last October Halloween weekend. Steve Angello was the DJ that night. He KILLED IT! Apparently they have guest DJs here all the time. . . It's your typical Vegas club you wait FOREVER in line unless you pay the bouncer $20  then you can skip the line then pay the $20-40 cover charge.. . The club itself is pretty big. Nice dance floor and the people there are beautiful. Of course the drinks are stupid expensive ($12 for a mixed drink) But that's why I brought my flask in I'm not spending that much for a drink lol . . Tryst which is next door at the wynn is usually my go to club but I think I found my new favorite spot. . . If you're a Vegas first timer get there early or try to go during the day and get on the guest list so you can skip the line.
Overrated. Supposedly best dance club on the planet. . Pros:. 1. Very good DJ, music selection, lights, and sounds.. 2. Beautiful architecture and views.. 3. Many beautiful ladies. . Cons:. 1. Dance floor is too small so it got too crowded. . 2. People keep bumping you while walking in/out of crowded floor. Breaks your rhythm. . 3. Many people just stand/walk. This is a Dance club; Not a Stand club. If you're not dancing, please go to pool area. Here people can listen to each other, introduce themselves, and then decide to dance. If not, there are plenty of fish in the sea.. 4. Management denied access to outdoor pool area to get fresh air, talk, and maybe dance outside. . 5. Bouncers/Security are rude. If you will deny access, apologize, state the reason, and smile. You only need to get tough After people don't respond to reason. Being rude is not a good Customer Service trait.. . Tip for Ladies. After your man knows you, high heels become a burden. Invest in comfortable dance shoes.
This was my 4th outing to a Las Vegas night club, and I was blown away by XS.  I probably took over 100 pics during the course of the time we were at XS - made for a hilarious scrap book.  . . Our wolf pack consisted of only 3 this time which is actually a great size in my opinion.  Three - four people is the best size for clubs because if you're going to do bottle service you don't get screwed on the pricing.  If you have a large group, I suggest not doing table service and paying as you go on drinks.. . I have always visited Las Vegas the way almost everyone does and that's a Thursday - Sunday trip.  This time around we went Sunday - Wednesday.  Honestly, it makes no difference.  Vegas is a town where people come to party no matter what day of the week.  We checked the internets to see what night would be the best at XS and Monday seemed to be pretty popular.  Well we were in luck because Diplo was spinning that night.  It didn't even feel like we were at a nightclub, this was a full on EDM concert.  It was sick.  If you ever get a chance to see Diplo live, do not hesitate - this guy was amazing.. . Quick run down on table location, and pricing.  Table location doesn't really make a difference at this place.  The tables are situated in a horse shoe shape around the DJ set, and it's stadium style.  So you step down 3 steps and there will be another horse shoe row of all tables.  Step down another 3 steps and you're on the dance floor.  Get the idea?  Price for the table and our liter of Maker's Mark was $600 or $200 per person (tax & tip included).  I recommend always paying up front and pay with cash.  Do not give them your credit card and keep it open...you'll get drunk and be tempted to get more drinks later on.. . The chain of events: We hung around the table, befriended some Japanese tourists, drank our bottle, took pics and videos of people dancing on tables and falling off the tables, finished our bottle by 1AM, ditched our table for the dance floor which was literally the best part.  We were up by the barrier soaking up the sounds of Diplo.  Pretty sure this place stays open til 4AM - we were there until close.  A slow pocket does not exist at this place - it was non stop music, dancing, drinking, & partying.  Out of the 4 night clubs I have been to in Las Vegas (XS, Marquee, Tryst, & Tao), XS is my favorite.  If you have not been to XS, you need to go.. . - A Ry
Had one of the best nights of my life here! Only drawback is you can't go into the main room until very very late if you got in through a promoter. Usually stay in nightclubs only a few hours, but we stayed here from 11pm to 5am!
With all the new clubs constantly sprouting about in Vegas, XS remains numero uno! This spacious place makes the most out of their indoor/outdoor atmosphere without making you feel lost or claustrophobic. Your feet will be spared of nightmarish stairs and there are plenty of places to give them a break. XS touts some of the best djs, and it never disappoints in diversity. Sound system is great so you can dance from anywhere without having to be near the main stage.. . For the grand finale, I suggest jumping into the pool at the end of the night. Unless you have a bathing suit on, you will be escorted out like a celebrity. ;). . If you want to feel like a VIP, you must hit up Rachel at 702-557-4160! She is by far one of the best promoters and delivers well on promises. Cant wait to be back at XS whenever I'm in Vegas!
Always a great party
Yes, this review is about three years too late.  That's about the number of years I've been going to Xs and I honestly cannot remember how many times I have been here.  It's a pretty decent number of times, but hey with age comes wisdom, so here's my two cents about what I think is Vegas's best club.. . Hands down this is my favorite club In Vegas.  It is absolutely gorgeous, everything about it from even before you enter the club to the bathrooms.  There's an indoor and outdoor section.  By the way, during the warmer months they open up the pool area so you can chill and stick your tired feet in.  Oh and I love their night swims, which is only open on Sunday nights during the summer months, mainly cause I love being in the pool and in my opinion night swim is so much better than day club.  You don't have to worry about dehydration and the sun as much. The only downside is that the water after a while gets kind of murky and you only wonder what's floating around in there. Bathrooms have plenty of stalls so you don't wait as long but sometimes there is a wait.  . . Coat check is towards the front entrance and hit up a promoter for guestlist, unless you want to be paying at the door.  Guestlist like goes relatively quickly but I would still suggest not being late.  Talk with your promoter about what time to be there and try to stick to it, yours is not the only party they have to take care of.. . Mostly edm music, but sometimes you'll get like lil Jon or will.i.am spinning.  Xs truly gives you the full Vegas experience, complete with pricey drinks.  Sorry, Vegas isn't cheap.
the club is pretty nice but the dj that was playing here last sunday wasnt too great.  they play the same type of music and didnt give much variety for me to shake my booty to.. i really didnt appreciate those bounces guys that they have there.  Pretty rude if u asked me.  i was with my group and we left within the hour i think.
Security escorted two guys out of the club for kissing. They are a homophobic and sexist and treat gay men as second class citizens. This is unexceptable  and WRONG!!!! Never again!!!
Not accomodating at all. Completely ignored anything we said and never paid attention to the actual line. We wwaited for over two hours when we scheduled ahead of time. Do NOT go to this club unless you are best friends with a promoter or know someone who can get you in. Otherwise, thr bouncers will count up the girls and let only girls in..complete waste of time.
Hands down my favorite night club in Vegas! Large venue, nice music selection and very detailed and interesting inside decor. I really liked their outside pool. It's super cool to hang there at night and you will also be able to find places to sit. If you are a conversationist, you can definitely hold a decent conversation by the pool without needing to yell at each other.. . The promoters could be rude since they are very popular and there are many people who would like to get in. One time, one of the promoters totally ditched us and we couldn't get in because there was some famous dj playing there that night. We were all pissed but the next night, it was very fluent and we got inside pretty early when it was not so crazy yet and we stayed till it closed. So it really depends on the night and your luck. Yesterday zed was performing there. We thought it might be too crazy and too crowded so we didn't go. In hind sight I totally would have ditched hakkasan for xs!
The experience at XS is definitely top notch during my past two visits. I highly recommend reaching out to a promoter, especially on busy nights, to guarantee your entry and to obtain free entrance for the ladies. There are a lot of beautiful ladies in this club.. . The sound system is excellent...no blown bass like some clubs in LA.. . Inside the club, there is an indoor and outdoor section. The outdoor section has a pool and a clear view from behind the DJ.. . The club itself caters heavily to VIP bottle service, leaving little room for general admission to hang out except on the walkways or dance floor.. . Bathrooms are clean and modern and ventilation indoors is excellent...no lingering cigarette smoke!. . The only downside is that it was extremely packed during my last visit when Zedd was playing.
Wow, what a club. Came here on Saturday and saw Zedd and wow, what an experience. We were on an artist guest list so it was a little difficult to get in and to find the right line but totally worth it. The music is great, the venue was one of a kind and I stayed there til 330 am. Can't wait to come back.
