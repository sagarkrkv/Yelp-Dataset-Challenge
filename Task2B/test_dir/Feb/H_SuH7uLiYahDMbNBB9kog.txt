I knew I had to go to this place when I saw it on LV's top five restaurants lists. My need to come became urgent when I discovered that 5 of my Yelp friends gave it five stars. When I realized it was less than two miles from home, I rearranged my plans and went by last night.. . I love Korean, I love Mexican, and I really love fusion. The menu made my mouth water, and from the sound of it, this place was poised to become my new favorite restaurant.. . But somehow I was underwhelmed.. BF and I went a little nuts and got the bulgogi nachos and the bulgogi cheesesteak, then added in the won ton soup for good measure. The nachos were tasty, but after getting the free chips and salsa/guac it was almost chip overload. The cheese was plentiful yet subtle, and the salsa had a light fruitiness to it- a lot of different flavors somehow came together really well. The cheesesteak is the stuff dreams are made of, for my BF- he inhaled it. Huge portion, great value for the price, but for me it lost the excitement after a few bites and the fries were just right (in terms of cooking- they were perfectly crisp) but bland (no salt or seasonings).. The won ton soup was our only non-fusion item and it was a good-sized portion with plenty of won tons and a light yet flavorful broth, with lots of onions. The description mentioned mushrooms but I only found one- not clear if they were inside the'tons and one popped out, or if there were meant to be more.. . Service leaves a lot to be desired. Only one waitress for the whole place, fairly slow and a bit too casual for my liking, but we did get our food and their business did pick up so I should probably not be quite so picky.. . Overall, the food was tasty- enough so that my BF ordered a burrito go to to take to a friend he wanted to introduce the food to- but after so many five star reviews and a great rating, I just had hyper-inflated expectations, I guess.. Will be trying the burrito myself next visit- wasn't in the mood for one last night, but maybe that dish will push me into five-star territory.
I'm gaga for their bulgogi!. . As their name suggests, KoMex is a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant with a little Chinese and American thrown in for good measure. This is truly a hidden gem; although it's only a few blocks from my house, it's located in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station, and I didn't even know it was there until I looked for nearby restaurants on Yelp. Now it's one of our go-to places for takeout (which I heartily recommend; because of its small size, you might have to wait a bit to dine indoors).. . I agree with other reviewers that their bulgogi fries are fantastic, but there's one menu combination that can't be beat: the beef chow fettuccine and pork-kimchi fried rice. We usually get a full order of the fettuccine and a half order of the rice, and the portions are so big that this will serve as two hearty meals for two hearty eaters.. . The beef chow fettuccine combines their signature bulgogi beef with red cabbage, onions, peppers, and carrots, all served over thick noodles. Sounds weird, but it's the best thing on the menu (IMHO). We like the fried rice with pork -- although I think any meat would befine -- but you HAVE to add the kimchi (and its traditional fried egg partner) to give it a little extra spice. I'm not a huge kimchi fan, but it works perfectly in this combination and is especially good when you mix the fried rice and the fettuccine together. DELISH!. . This time we also each ordered a chicken lettuce wrap as an appetizer. Once again, any meat combo would do in this dish. We've tried the bulgogi and the pork belly before, but today chicken won out. Chopped chicken topped with cabbage and cilantro, all wrapped up in an iceberg lettuce leaf. You can also get these as tacos (corn or flour tortillas), but the lettuce was a refreshing change from our otherwise carb-heavy meal.. . Takeout service is quick and efficient, and the counter help is always friendly and appreciative when we arrive. And you can't bet the price, especially for these huge portions: $23 for two great meals for two. Thanks to the food gods for putting KoMex so close to home!
I knew that I was going to like this place before even stepping in. Komex is a fusion of Mexican and Asian...my two favorite foods. Their dishes are creative and very different. . . The fusion fries came in a huge order...very generous portions. I should've probably ordered the half order for my friend and I. The Bulgogi Tostada was my favorite dish...sweet and spicy. . . We also got the Bulgogi Nachos which were good but only the first layer...the toppings did not infect the whole order of nachos:( There was just not enough. The rest were just well chips...which are free when you dine in.. . Although everything was delicious, it's also very heavy...Mexican food usually is. I wouldn't eat here everyday but I can see myself craving Komex and making the drive to indulge in these unique dishes.
Bulgogi fries=awesome. I really think this plate put 'em on the map. The rest of our dishes were pretty standard (fried rice and tacos.) . . Definitely worth a try, so go!
Since moving to the Summerlin side of town, KoMex take out has been on rotation in our house almost weekly. They specialize in Korean/Mexican fusion and you really can't go wrong with anything "fusion" on the menu.  I am a huge fan of their tacos, especially the pork belly. They are pretty small, but they are loaded with delicious meat and cheap. I am also seriously addicted to their chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa has a little kick and great tomato flavor and the chips are homemade! YUM! My husband is partial to the fusion burrito, which is both delicious and filling. We have also tried the fusion cheesesteak with fries and it is out of this world delicious! It is super cheesy and of course the bulgogi is so flavorful. The fries are disappointing but that may be because they are usually cold by the time we get them home. We recently tried the fusion wings and my husband loved the flavor, but they definitely have a bit of a kick. The only thing that I have had that I was not into was the Chow Fettuccine. It was actually much better reheated the next day, but I just wasn't a fan of the flavors and it was a tiny bit greasy. Other than that one dish everything we have tried has been outstanding! If you are looking for something different and delicious you should definitely give it a try!
Excellent service...  Food was really tasty and alot for your money.  I always make sure when I am visiting Las Vegas this will be a stop on my trip.
I had a terrible experience here and will never be coming back. The only good thing about this place was the tortilla chips and green tea. The bulgogi meat is flavorless, our order was made completely wrong. Who doesn't know how to fry an egg for crying out loud? The spam musubi was completely dry and tasted like the nori was old. Even the fortune cookie was stale. Not just disappointing, I feel robbed for having to pay 20+ dollars just for tea and a few chips.
KoMex was so so delicious I enjoyed my kimchee rice and the bulgogi burrito.  I will definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and family...so yummy!! Will come again for sure!
Delicious Mexican enchiladas, good rice & beans! This place is a great spot for real fusion food! The service is very friendly and helpful.
Love, love, love their food. Tastes fresh. You can tell they use quality ingredients. This is not fast food. It takes time, but it's worth it.  If only I lived closer to Komex...
My family and I came here today for lunch. Small shop, but great customer service. I am Vegan but my family isn't so it can be tricky sometimes to find a spot that we all like. I was pleasantly surprised that they had meat substitutes with tofu or vegetables! Awesome. I ordered 2 Komex tacos with tofu, and a side order of Kimchee fried rice. My husband ordered the Bulgogi burrito and he absolutely loved it. My daughter had a spam musubi and son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. I was also happy that they had stevia and sugar in the raw as an option for my tea. My food was delicious but I would recommend done thing. To maybe marinate and fry the tofu so it has a crispier texture when placed in the tacos. Over-all, great experience.
We went to Komex this trip...had to try the new location on Buffalo because the Decauter location was closed on Sunday....EVERY bit as wonderful and it was so hard to leave.  GREAT news is they sell their sweet/spicy Koren hotsauce by the pound, so will have to bring a leak proof container when we visit the kid again in April!!!  Woooo-Wooo....book a nonstop flight and do the same....SO worth it!!!  Had the Bulgogi nachos and our normal corn tortilla tacos...my sister, the pickiest eater EVER could NOT stop singing their praises!!!  She was even telling folks on the plane about them!!!  Thanks again Komex for the BEST dining experience our entire trip (and we enjoyed some world class cuisine!)  Will be back in April for sure!!!!. PS....PLEASE publish a cook book for those of us that live in other states and are in NEED of a KoMex experience!!!!  ;)
Came to Vegas to hang for a couple if days with my son. We got burned out on the strip and Yelped Mexican, found KoMex, grabbed the car and drove right over - TOTALLY worth the drive! I had the fusion fish tacos and my son got the bulgogi burrito - for 20 years I've been on the hunt for the best fish taco and I think I found it at LoMex - I also ordered a half order of kimchi fried rice but they brought me a full order by mistake - oops - I had to leave with the other half to take home but they only charged me half (!) great food great service and great prices I wish I could take this great little hole-in-the-wall treasure home to San Jose with me...
Love their fusion tostadas and nachos. Very addicting. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu actually. Cheap prices too. We go everytime we hit up vegas.
I love Mexican food and I love Asian food, so why not eat them together! This place is great because it combines both cuisines into various fusion dishes, but you can still get strictly Korean or Mexican food if you're not into the combo. One of my favorite dishes was the pork lettuce wraps. It was an Asian lettuce wrap but then they added pico on top! Great combo! The beef bulgogi chimichanga and fusion fries were also awesome. If you want great food with innovative combinations, check this place out!
Went for lunch today and the place was absolutely packed. It is a fairly small location, but certainly worth the wait. The hostess was friendly despite having to work a very busy floor.. . I had the pork burrito and my friend had the 2 meat platter with rice. Food was much better than expected, hot and fresh. They also bring over a little sauce tray for you to try a variety of sauces on your food as you eat.. . Overall, a very pleasant experience and judging from the line of customers waiting to get inside, well worth the wait.  I would highly recommend this place.
Its kind of like kOGI, but different. I recommend bulgogi with anything. Their fried rice is very good too.
I should receive a free Gym membership with how much I eat here.. . I absolutely LOVE the tofu lettuce wraps, vegetable chimichanga and french fries.. . The first time I went to the North Decatur location I got a little lost. The place isn't easy to find but as I did a U turn, I saw a very long line out the door of a hole in the wall looking place, looked up and realized I was in the right place! I quickly pulled in, parked and waited in line. Despite the long line and how small the space is, the cashiers moved through each persons order rather quickly. When I got to the counter, I had asked them what their best vegetarian & vegan friendly dishes were and by was I surprised on how informed and genuinely friendly their staff was. It wasn't long before I placed my order. An extra spicy Korean vegan burrito, french fries and a drink. Needless to say, I fell in love and have been eating at KoMex ever since.. . Now, I tend to frequent the Buffalo & Flamingo location simply because it's closer to where I live but don't worry, both locations are fantastic! Do not miss these hidden gems!
I come here everytime I am go to Las Vegas.  I heard about this place from one of my friends, and it was worth the short drive off the strip.  First thing I noticed was the parking lot is a bit compact, if you go during peek hours, good luck finding a spot, I usually just park In the back on the side of the road.  Inside is typically clean when I go and the staff is very friendly.  . . I always get the Bulgogi burrito, and Bulgogi fries,  My friends opt out for the tacos.  Can't be the price for the food here.  Its a nice little Asian/Mexican fusion place that I would highly recommend
