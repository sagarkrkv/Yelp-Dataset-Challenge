Stayed at encore, and decided to go clubbing here so i wont have to drive. There is a water fall outside the dance floor in the club! Never seen that before. That was nice. Nice decor. Besides that is was cool. Ok music. Mix of EDM and hip hop/maybe top 40's. Bartender was super nice took care of me every time i walked near the bar. Usual vegas drink prices. Must see at least once.
Tryst is basically XS lite. much smaller, with a lot less talent. but still a decent place to kill some time in vegas, especially if you dont want to deal with getting into XS or Marquee or the like.
I had an awesome time here on Saturday February 15th. We had an issue at XS and the table we reserved through a promoter apparently was never reserved at all so my group of 12, 5 guys and 7 girls headed to Tryst. We talked to Bobby and he got us a great table and bottles for a much better price than XS. Anything we wanted, he hooked it up. Random creepers getting too close to our space he moved out of our area.. Given we were trading Kaskade for Jermaine Dupri, by the time the bottles came out and times were a-rollin we didn't care bc we had a great table, our close friends by our sides and pretty good music. . There were only 2 downsides to this night, the fact that 1/2 the time JD was stuck in the 90's hip hop jam, don't get me wrong I love 90s rap and hiphop but I never (ever) wanna hear Tupac ever again. The 2nd was the hobo lookin 8 months pregnant 40 y.o. bug eyed woman with dreads that they let in the club. Seriously, wtf? . Next time I'll make sure my table at XS is on lock but if BS happens again, I'll happily head on over to Tryst.
Vegas nightclubs have a short life span of when they're hot. Kind of like models or athletes, only Vegas nightclubs are not as forgiving. They have a much shorter shelf life. I would say it's really great if a club can stay going strong for a couple years in a row.. . I've been here two times. The first time I saw it I thought it was the hottest place I had ever seen. It was much newer, and everyone wanted to get in. Hotter people showed up, and so did hotter DJ's. High rollers wanted to drop lots of cash here. It was popping.. . Second time was fun. I got a free table to sit at with my girlfriend and free champagne all night, and the waiters working were all hot as hell. The bartender women were sort of  bitchy but nothin I can't handle. It's just not that fresh a place anymore. I mean that in two ways... like for the love of God, tryst, replace your carpet. And the crowd there is just not what I would prefer. When your dancefloor is packed with men only, that's when you know you failed. That should never happen in a city famous for their nightlife.. . The sexy people are taking their fine asses elsewhere.. . They used to play more hip hop here. Now they mix in top 40 and EDM. My drunk girlfriend yelled at the DJ because he started replaying songs at like 2AM, to which I say, preach girl. He sucked.. . It's a damn shame Tryst couldn't keep it up.
This place is very meh.. The scenery was pretty ok because you can see the falls of Wynn. The dj is performing right in front of the falls, that was pretty cool. Other than that, the music was very blah and the guys there were all kinda creepy. They don't ask you if you would like to dance with them, they just grabbed you. Very rude. So we left very shortly after we got there
