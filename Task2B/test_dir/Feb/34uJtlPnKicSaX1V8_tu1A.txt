The smoking rooms are in much better repair than on Palazzo side where they put in the damaged furniture. On my last trip Palazzo was sold out so I reluctantly booked at Venetian. Overall, I think they are much more on top of things here. The downside is that they use awful, antiquated thermostats that have knob dials. My room was set to max heat and it was still freezing. Maintenance cleaned the filter from what I could tell but that only helped a little. The light also burned out in the water closet. Otherwise, the furniture was in good repair, the bed was comfortable, and service from Housekeeping exemplary. Small closet safe, I forgot you don't get a larger one like Palazzo. The hallways are nicer here too, as are the views.
Shared a suite with 7 girls, the room was big enough for all of us (fold out sofa bed helped!) rooms are clean and pretty nice, the bathroom has a lot of vanity space for multiple people to get ready at once. The Venetian itself is an all-inclusive resort of course, there are nice little places to eat if you want something convenient, good location on the strip, pool and hot tubs for down time, and of course the Venezia theme is lovely.
Awesome hotel on the strip with Tao as an awesome club. This is the place that I normally stay at. The suites are huge. Staff can sometimes be slow, but it's not too bad. Very clean and gorgeous place to be.
A very nice resort hotel! The suite room is very spacious and comfortable. The only thing is the view, we stayed at the side where is just no view except for some buildings thats still under construction. But it didn't really bother us since we were out on the casino all night! Overall just a great place to stay.
I absolutely LOVE this hotel! A girlfriend and I spent our first trip to Vegas here and plan on staying here our next visit. The hotel is one of the cleanest that i've been to! In our roomy Bella two bed queen suite we didn't have a mark on the walls and the white woodwork looked as if it had been maintained quite nice. Our view wasn't too bad but I would of preferred to get a little bit more sunlight. We received a room in the Venezia tower and it overlooked the courtyard and one of the pool areas.The only thing was that we didn't see the 17 inch TV in the bathroom that they advertise on the website. Otherwise we had a smooth check in and smooth check out!
This is the nicest indoor walk in town.  You get to stroll by a "river", look up at the "clouds", and hear random opera singers walk around belting some serious crescendos.  This is the one placeI can grab gelato and a purse all in one walk.
The best hotel in Vegas in my opinion.. We had my bachelorette party here last august and stayed in the Bella Suite. 2 queens beds plus a pull out couch w/sunken living room. The room was beautiful as was the entire hotel. Customer service was great too - my sister picked up something from the minibar then put it back and we got charged for it. I explained the situation to the front desk and they removed the charge without hassle. Would love to stay in this hotel everything if I could!
The venetian is amzing.  It is a little cheaper than the Palazzo, but it has pretty much the same amenities.  The rooms are almost identical, except that in the Palazzo everything seems to be gold plated (bling, bling)!  Staff is awesome and extremely accomodating.
The rooms are all suites, which is obviously saaaaweeet! Except it can be super confusing to figure out exactly where to go to actually get to your room. There are two towers. Apparently one is the new and one is the old.. . We were in the old, but was able to check out the new because my parents were assigned there. While the new is brighter, a little more modern and located by the pool, I didn't mind our "older" suite.. . The Venetian isn't the most expensive on the strip, it's not the cheapest either, so I appreciated the nice rooms. I've stayed atthe Aria and Planet Hollywood (and one random awful time share property) this was probably the nicest. . . I loved having the living room set up with a large sectional, I did find a random frito in it, but I digress. It wasn't a dirty room. I loved the bathroom! Super spacious, stand up shower AND jacuzzi, which I thoroughly enjoyed one day. Plus, extra bonus points for the make-up table and mirror. Plus a separate room for the toilet. . . The good thing about staying in the "older" tower is you're an elevator ride away from the casino. Can I rate the casino? Eh, I'm not much of a gambler. But I did enjoy the coffee stand right outside the elevators and the gelato stand by the back entrance.. . I experienced the pool only for an hour one day because we were here in November and I thought it was just too chilly to take a dip. But, the good thing is it's a heated pool! Tons of seating and room in the pool. Plus a large bar outside.. . The one negative is that I found it to be on the farther end of the Strip. While I thought it was a nice place, I probably wouldn't stay here again because of that. I like to be in the middle of everything. But it wasn't as far as say, the Wynn. Which is WAY too far for me.
I adored our suite at The Venetian. The Bella Suite with two queen beds and a pullout sofa was perfectly sized for our girl party of three. The suite has two televisions, one located in view of the two queen beds and the other in the sunken living room with the pullout. The bathroom was beautiful with a large bathtub, standup shower and a vanity. We had a lovely view of the pool, which was in use, surprisingly, as the temperatures during our stay were in the 50s with very little sun. . . My biggest complaints would be the amount of noise we heard from a private party on the lowest floor that made it up to our 11th floor suite. My friends were more than a little disappointed at the lack of a coffee maker, as our room was so far that going to grab a morning coffee was not a quick and easy task.. . The Venetian has many high end shops and fabulous restaurants, which we took full advantage of during our stay. We found ourselves lost one evening looking for one of the cocktail lounges, as the premises are quite large and not clearly marked. The trek to our room was a bit further than we were expecting, this kept us from going down to the Casino a few nights after going to our room to change into more comfortable shoes.. . The Venetian is a great hotel, I will likely stay at it again.
Great hotel! Great Service and Great ROOMS!
I love the big rooms.. . The staff is also very kind. We had a wonderful time.
Absolutely phenomenal. Gorgeous inside and out. Rooms are as spacious as you can ask for and it's on the strip ... What more can you ask for at 6am coming home from the club?
This is the most amazing resort I have stayed at. Words escape me as I walked through the lobby it was simply gorgeous. Chandeliers the size of a large car hung throughout the check-in process. How I heard anything the friendly staff member said at the check-in is beyond me because I was looking up with my mouth hanging open the entire time at the Michael Angelo like frescos! Check- in is complete even with an offer to upgrade. Early check-in, granted, and off to our suite. Put your walking shoes on - i'm not kidding! The resort is so huge! Maybe the size of a small city? You're warned. We were on the 30th floor and that was only half way up. The suite is immaculate with a sunk in living room, L shaped sofa, large desk, small table & chairs with an incredible view of Vegas, separate king bed platform, 3 large flat screen t.v's (there is more but you get the gist) ...one being in the bathroom which was lovely to watch while in the shower or the time spent at the vanity. We were delighted with every aspect of our suite! The staff was unparalleled to any other, extremely friendly and helpful. Every interaction from the concierge to the doorman was a pleasure!  We visited a handful of other resorts on the strip and not one stood above The Venetian. Just to mention one lovely moment we were walking through the gorgeous lobby we happen to be delighted by an accordion player and we stopped to take it all in when he notices us and begins to play a love song, yes right there is the lobby we slow dance. It was a perfect moment!
This place is the best bet. The hotel and Resort is amazing.  I'm really not much of a gambler. So I like to walk around and enjoy the hotel. As with many of the hotels in Vegas, there are gambling tables, restaurants buffets, shops and shows. But the nation is an excellent place if you consider the service the place is top notch. Although the place is huge I did not feel overwhelmed. The shopping area of wines in and out of the resort along with the gondola. The food here is exceptional I happily stayed most of my time two days here.
The hotel looks great. I do notice though they have shut down there websites. I also notice unhappy employees. I should not need to see this. I could not even get a win/loss player club statement. The employees say the have no clue.. . I will not be going there this year. They do not apparently need the money bad enough.. . I can't even get return calls.
The Venetian has got to have the most nonchalant, brinking on the rude, staff. No one here smiles, greets you straight or apologizes even after major snafus. . The rooms are great and I got a great deal on the room prices. But does that outweigh the terrible service quality? No. I would pay some extra for a hotel with a little bit of a courteous staff. Being in a crappy, complaining mood during vacation is just not worth it. Stroll through the casino, use their restrooms but don't spend even a penny at this place. A cocktail waitress at the casino actually stood around after each drink and literally asked for her tip. At the Grand Lux, our server Liza T was the epitome of bad service and ridiculous etiquette. Add to that she didn't even understand simple instructions- like eggs need to be poached!
Don't go! Ok where do I begin? Valentine's weekend with 4 other couples. They stay here every year and have had nothing but great experiences until THIS YEAR! We arrived, I had booked and paid for our trip on AMEX travel, prepaid for all nights (stupid) and because of AMEX plat. guaranteed a room upgrade on check in. They said, they don't honor that and all the rooms are the same. You get what you get. Mt husband had prearranged a room assignment because he sent me roses and wanted them in the room when we arrived (aww) he had the room number and everything after calling and arranging. Separately,  I had had two packages sent to the hotel and arranged for them to be delivered to the room as a surprise for him. Both perishable and for Valentine's day!! Point 1.. Chocolate dipped strawberries and a dozen roses. OK. We checked in and when my husband noticed the room we were given keys for was not the room they gave him the preassignment for, he asked if she had notes in our file. She said yes, all was taken care of but the room number was different. So our room on the 30th floor with a view he arranged turned into a room over the extractor fans of the kitchen where we smelled food frying day and night overlooking a construction sight on the 22nd floor. OK back to My packages. I quietly asked the front desk attendant if two other packages had been attached to our reservation and she looked and looked in the computer and said no. Samantha said the package department was now gone for the day (VALENTINE'S DAY!!!)  but, she would look into it and call us in our room in a few minutes. She would see if someone could find them and get them to us.. Up to our dirty stinky room. My roses from him were there. Aww. We unpacked, changed and waited. We had dinner with our friends at 7 so we called down, it had been over an hour and no call from Samantha. Oh, they say, Samantha had gone to lunch. Sorry. We asked to speak to a manager and they said the manager was also at lunch. We said we were going out, please have someone leave a message. . Gone all evening of Valentine's evening, get back to the room, no message, no flowers or strawberries. Called down, guess what....Samantha had gone home for the day. EFFF. We went to bed. We woke up in the morning to a blinking light on the phone. The message said the roses had been delivered earlier in the day. (they were talking about my roses that he sent to ME) I called and it took the whole day to track the packages and the Manager himself had signed for the packages and kept them on his desk and gone home. My husband got rotten strawberries and wilted roses the evening AFTER Valentine's day. $300.00 worth of goods. The hotel didn't care one bit. . . The Bouchon restaurant the service is SLOOOOOWWWWWW!!! 3 hours for coffee yogurt and bread with butter and jam. 2 hours for dinner with our friends before a show and we told them we had a show, the entrees came out one at a time. most people were finished eating by the time the last guests got their meal. We were nearly late for the show. We came back and went to the Grand Luxe Cafe for dessert. OMG!!!! The marble floors were sooooooo greasy, that even with rubber soles on my shoes, it was like ice skating into the restaurant. The ENTIRE floor was disgusting!!! We sat down and ordered desserts. 1.5 hours of torture waiting for a biscuit to bake for my strawberry shortcake. everyone was finished with dessert, coffee, tea, and still waiting, our waitress, was avoiding having to talk to us, so one of my friends went to talk to someone. When he asked why it takes so long for one dessert, no one offered a replacement, or told us of a delay until everyone had been served and were eating for a while, he was told to be quiet and go sit down. When he got upset at being talked to like that they treated to call the police and told him to leave.  OUT OF CONTROL!!. . Bottom Line, It's old, run down, falling apart, dirty and the employees are unhappy.
Awe! Stayed in one of their suites in July 2012.. . Room was 1500 square feet. Bathroom was just amazing. Very large jetted tub.. . King size bed was comfy. Coffered ceilings in the bedroom.  Plenty of nice drawers to organize your clothes. Sliding doors for bedroom privacy.. . Dining room table could easily seat 6 to 8 people. Wet bar is large. . . Nice size living/tv area. Seats 8 easily. Duel desks.. . Large bay windows! See pics.. . Canyon Ranch spa is located at this resort. Largest spa in the world from what I have been told.. . Spent two afternoons at this spa. Absolutely loved it. Can't wait to visit again.. . Pool area was so nice. Private just for resort guests. They pass out cucumbers to place over your eyes while you sun bathe. Lovely and relaxing.. . Lounge chairs are available in the shallow end of the pool in order to get the most out of your sun bathing experience keeping you comfortable in the summer heat.. . Enjoyed dinner at Bouchon first night. Exquisite! Dinner at Delmonico Steakhouse a second night. Filet Minion was excellent.. . This is the best resort in Vegas in my opinion. Recommend it for a great getaway. You don't even need to leave the property. Everything you need to enjoy life is available on this large piece of real estate.
Never leave any - and I mean not even a piece of cheap jewelry in your room. I had a $30 bracelet taken from my room after we left for a show at 8:30pm! Called security filled out report and they said "we will get back to you in 72hrs. Never heard back. I know it's a cheap piece of jewelry, but it's a matter of principle! Also left my iPhone charger in my room and of course "it was not turned in" . What goes around comes around. Where are all the honest people? Not in Vegas!  This never would happen in The Mandarin, next time I'll stay there!
Visited Valentine's day.. . I don't come here much because I think the smell they pump through property is obnoxious, also the place is so big and without ample signage it is hard to find certain places/venues. . Soul 2 soul is a great show and we had a nice dinner at Zepphirino(spelling dicey). . The cocktail server in the pit however was NOT amazing. . . Ordered about 15 minutes into new blackjack shoe(normal), . . We were the only people playing at the table for 45 minutes so a single drink is obtainable by Vegas service standards of 15-20 minutes rounds. . Got through the entire shoe up double so we had just colored our chips out when the server came with our drinks and claimed to not know who we were and what we had ordered.  . . This was not incredible as we could see our drinks on the tray.  I don't think this is acceptable and I am certainly not into this sort of behavior at a five diamond resort. . I don't so much care about the drink as I am with the lack of hospitality.. . This woman alone is the reason for the 2 stars.
My first time ever going to Vegas with my boys and this is where we stayed. I was actually amazed by the size of the room we got. If I still have the pictures on my phone I'll upload them later. The girl at the front desk was extremely nice and very cute. Since the security deposit was going on my Credit Card naturally I had quite a few questions to ask. She answered them all perfectly and made the check in process go smoothly.. . Having to walk thru the casino floor to reach theelevators to our room, and also the guard standing at the elevators who checks you for a room key I found to be slightly awkward and unneeded, but after a few days he started to recognize our group and would let me and my buddies go by unbothered.  . . As everyone knows, the more time you spend at a table, the more drinks you get for free. Big change from the casinos out here in California that actually charge you $1 per hand that you play (house tax) plus every drink you order. Las Vegas knows how to take care of its players and for that I am grateful. . . I met quite a few different card dealers, one of whom was absolutely hilarious and actually advised me on when to hit or when to stand. Was definitely helpful especially since I was on a $25 minimum table. I didn't actually win any money but he helped the time go by and pretty much kept me at even throughout the night. . . GO PLAY THE SPORTS BOOK and get a Grazi (I know I spelled that wrong) membership card. I bet on all the hockey games, and won a lot of money, only to spend it all on food the next few nights. But hey, if you play your cards right in Vegas you should be eating free every night anyways. . . BEST PART: Pauly Shore walked right by us as my buddy and I were getting up from a Blackjack table. Of course my buddy made a huge scene and yelled "Dude, thats Pauly Shore!!" To which he turned around and made eye contact with us with a little smirk and a wink. . . Overall a great trip. If I ever go back, I would stay at the Venetian again. . . MY PRO TIP: At check in, tip the front desk worker a twenty dollar bill, and see what kind of surprises and/or upgrades they hook you up with. Hopefully you get someone cool who understands, otherwise its only a twenty spot that you're out. Highly Recommend doing this at every hotel you stay at.
Here for the weekend, the hotel is quite nice. Check in was fast and convenient, got a beautiful room on the 21st floor with a view of the pool and the strip. The room has an awesome sunken living room which was great for our pre partying. There are tons and tons of shops and restaurants in the hotel, anything you forgot, need, or want you can find here. Went to Tao nightclub Friday night and had a blast, got a table and bottle derive and nightly recommend it. As always, Vegas is expensive so bring money!
Great rooms! Nicely decorated, very spacious, and comfortable with tons of amenities. Bed is super comfy and room has central air. Room service is excellent and fairly fast. Bathroom is huge with large jacuzzi tub & small tv. Robes in the closet were a nice touch. Check in and check out were fast, with helpful front desk staff. Highly recommend this hotel is you're staying on the strip.
We had a double queen bed and it looked pretty nice. The room has a living room area that's a level lower than the bedroom level. However, we found that the room had many issues. Many outlets didn't work, the bathroom door didn't lock, etc. but they have everything you need and maybe some extra. I really loved their bathroom. Very well decorated and furnished,me specially the dressing make up area.. . The pool on the fourth floor was a little disappointing. It didn't seem very well maintained or organized. Maybe if we went in summer time, it'll be different.
Shop, Eat, drink, play and stay. No need to leave this resort unless you've never been to Vegas, and you want to explore. . . Elegant resort with one of THE best casinos.   No tacky and cheap Vegas feel...5 star every where you turn. . . Bought a package through groupon which included an invited guest check in...their version of express check in. Only 2 guests ahead of us, where general check in was packed. Check in took less than 5 minutes, and our room was available, no waiting.. . Valet parking is included in the resort fee, and if you're leaving the resort after 11am check out, there is a baggage area that can hold your luggage until you're ready to leave.. . Stayed in suite 33-127. View of Caesars and the Mirage....pool view below and quite a bit   of rooftop. . . Suite was clean as a pin, spacious and one of the newly upgraded. Bathroom had a vanity with evening and day lighted mirror, wall mounted flat screen tv, amenities, robes and a safe. The bed was super comfortable and linens were clean and free of any wear or tear. Bedroom and living room each had flat screen tv's...sunken sitting area, dining table and desk. On one night stand, there was an iPhone charging station with radio (Nice bonus). Even though wi-fi was included in the resort fee, it was painfully slow and cell service in the room was weak.. . Our floor was very quiet and smoke free. Casino, although still a bit smokey, has an amazing filtration system and does a great job at minimizing smoke overload and pumping lots of O2 into the air. But still, as I write this, and being far away from Vegas, I can still smell smoke in my nose! Yuck!. . All employee contact was polite and courteous and everyone was eager to please. We had great luck at the casino and felt that the payouts were very generous. Plenty of tables and slots.. . Excellent variety of restaurants and shops, and of course you have the opportunity to enjoy the gondola's and stroll the romantic Italian piazzas.. . Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay. Would not consider any other resort.
Tres connu, le Venetian est un tres beau casino et ses galeries interieures meritent autant le detour que ses canaux a l'exterieur. J'avais peur de l'effet un peu kitch, mais finalement non, le lieu est assez charmant. Passez-y si vous etes a Vegas.
One of my favorite places to stay in Vegas while with a large posse of girls. . . Staff are always SO friendly-- their smiles and greetings are always genuine.  I typically stay in one of the suites... why is it that these things always have huge foyers?  Total waste of space, not that the luxury suites really need more space...
This review is solely for a member of the casino staff, not the hotel accommodations or anything else. My friends and I were walking around the casino at around 5 in the morning looking for food after a very hectic night. We were a group of 3 Asian American guys, 1 Indian American guy, and me (Asian American girl). We approached a manager (his name was Jeff), to ask (in perfect American accents) if there were any food places around that were open at that time. He seemed willing to help, and looked over our group for a few seconds, then told us that he wasn't sure what kind of Asian food was around, but that there might be some "Vietnamese or Thai places off the strip" if we wanted to go that far. My friends and I were so surprised by this blatantly racist statement, and gently told him that we were looking for any kind of food, not just Asian food. He seemed a bit flustered, as if he realized that what he said was a bit of a faux pas, and directed us towards a couple open restaurants within the Venetian. We thanked him and left, somewhat in a state of shock. . . Admittedly, it was very early in the morning, and I understand that Jeff was most likely trying to be nice and giving us selections that he thought we would be familiar with. However, I would think that out of all the different people visiting Vegas every day, the staff should be a little more wary of statements that could be construed as offensive. I'm not saying this guy should be fired, since it was clear that he was trying to be helpful, but I hope he learns that when dealing with customers, it's very important to be aware of political and social correctness.
