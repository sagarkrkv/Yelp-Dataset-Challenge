This is a pretty good buffet, but be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions.. . Hangry - Ridic line and is barely moving. Chill - Grab a beer from the bar and sit down in line. Hangry - Realize you've been in line for more than 1 hr. Cloud 9 - EAT EVERYTHING. Don't talk to me I'm eating!!! . Regret - Why did I eat everything?. Food coma - zzzz. . Not sure if I would go back. It's kinda out of the way, but we weren't staying on the strip anyways and everyone was super hungry after climbing at Red Rocks all day.
Went here on Jan 31 2014 Friday for Lunch. It was about 12:30pm when we got there. There is no problem to pay at cashier counter. However, it took FOREVER (40 mins) to get seated. the Lady needs training. When you walked in, you can get tons of empty tables.  I gave the one star for the lady. I think her name is Hilda? ( the one with her hair bleached). . . The food is good as usual. I will come back but I hope I don't have to wait forever to get seated.
Get the Prime Rib first, very tender, melts in your mouth.  Their desserts are amazing. ESpecially the crepes, creme brulee, and the ice cream.   . What not to get: buffalo chicken sliders, and korean Short ribs. What a steal.  $15.99 for lunch on weekday.  . and it comes with complimentary beer, wine, and latte, etc.    The beer does fill you up though
This is my first buffet in Vegas and it lived up to my expectations.  Service was good and lots of dishes to choose from.  Really liked the sashimi salad with fresh chunks of fish.  Gelato bar was awesome.  Desserts looked amazing, tasted only ok.  Creme burlee was a disappointment especially since it's not the hardest thing to make (just egg yolks, cream, sugar, vanilla).  Overall my party of 7 enjoyed the meal.
I was excited to eat here after reading some reviews online and hearing good things from friends.  We waited in line for well over and hour for the seafood buffet, and it was rather expensive at $40 per person.. I'll get the good out of the way: included beer, wine and coffee.  If you consider just this point, it's probably worth it for the standard buffet price if you drink a lot.. Otherwise, this buffet was entirely disappointing, especially compared to other buffets I have experienced on the strip.  . There were no stand-outs with the food.  There was, however, certainly some inedible food, like the leg of lamb (extremely dry and gamey) and steak.  The crab was tasteless, most of the meat was dry and tough, there were hardly any interesting dishes, and the best things were just mediocre. The oxtail soup had a pretty nice flavor, but was rendered inedible by large pieces of star anise that would overpower the flavor when you bit into them. . The bulk of the desserts were boring and way too sweet, from a lemon sorbet that tasted like artificial lemon-flavored sugar, to a cup of imitation chocolate-like substance covered in Oreos.. It was nice to have espresso drinks with dessert, though (with "Bailey's"), and the creme brulee wasn't bad.  Otherwise, there was nothing worth mentioning.. overall, this buffet is definitely not worth the crazy wait or the high price.  One star out of five for food and an extra for included alcohol and coffee. . My advice: stay away from here.  You can find much better down at the strip.  Try out the Bellagio or Ceasar's Palace.. The table service was below average.  Plates weren't cleared promptly, and drinks weren't refilled quickly.  The older gentleman that was slicing meat, however, rendered the best service I had anywhere all weekend.  He was awesome: friendly, attentive and funny.  It's just too bad he was slicing up dry and flavorless meat!
I have been putting off writing this review because I was trying to recall something positive about the experience.  Here is what I came up with.. Positive - Beer and Wine is included in the price. And it isn't horrible..                   Deserts are great, some of the better Gelato I have had outside of Italy..                   a lot of choices..                   The chef was very friendly and eager to assist at the carving station.. . The rest of the review - Ok this was a horrible experience from the start.  When we arrived we were sixth in line on a mid week night..  It took us over 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 30 minutes to get seated.  The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).. . So we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  . . My first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.. . Specific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level). . When we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.. . The place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1/2 of in the car.). . Under our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.). . All in all it was a huge disappointment.  I think the majority of people who rate this place high do so because of the free alcohol.. . I will not be back here.
It was ok for the price. Nothing really spectacular. They couldn't serve beer at the table you had to go to the bar to get them.
Studio B is always a pit stop before returning to California. And I never regret it!. . The layout of this place can be a bit overwhelming - unlike other Vegas buffets, there isn't any signage to point you in any direction. However, after doing a once-over, you'll get an idea as to how it's set up.. . Overall, I feel the food quality is better than other buffets on the strip (although the new Bacchanal buffet is now my favorite!) and you get the most bang for your buck. This place has the widest variety of desserts: pastries (sugar-free included!), gelato, coffees, and even liqueurs. Obviously not everything is amazing; some items aren't that great (like lobster bisque, clam chowder, and cream of mushroom), but I find that I enjoy the majority - enough to feel money well spent.. . Also included in the meal are wines and beers.. . NOTE: If you're looking for a LOT of seafood, you won't find a wide variety here. They do have shrimp and raw oysters and depending on when you go, crab legs.. . Remember: there's no shame in double fisting platefuls of food. Just wear a loose fitting top...
Don't waste your time TRYING to eat here. They made us wait for 2 hours while they cleared the v.i.p. line at least 5 times. I work in a restaurant in a casino on the strip and obviously you cater to your big gamers... But that was absolutely ridiculous. Our line didn't even move. The manager was completely nonchalant when we voiced or complaint and we weren't even the first group to step out of line, demand a refund, and leave.
Went here on a Saturday evening so I knew there would be a wait and we waited for about 40 minutes in line. Anyone who's not willing to wait at least a little bit should just leave. Because of the location prices are definitely lower for a weekend buffet than similar buffets on the strip plus this one comes with beer, cider and wine included. The place is very casual with lots of tourists and families with little kids, definitely not a date place. Service was decent with soft drinks and water being refilled regularly and dishes being taken away promptly. . . The food was very good for a Vegas buffet. Weekends are seafood and there was a LOT of it. Hot and iced crab legs (but I seemed to be the only one who enjoyed it cold), sushi which was decent but heavy on the cucumber instead of the tuna and nigiri that was definitely not top quality but was edible, very good fried cod, ceviche which was barely edible, and a really good salmon dishes. There was also a very well stocked salad bar and lots of none seafood dishes including a carving station. Since it was Chinese New Year (ish) there was also Chinese food which was just god-awful and made me very sad. Dessert was DELICIOUS because they had flan and creme brule in addition to some other pastries and small cakes (all on their own little individual plates) that I didn' bother with because of the flan and creme brulee. . . The place is very beautiful and the buffet itself is set up as one long bar that curves through the middle of the space. It makes it a little harder to reach things than in many buffets were tables are in the middle and the food is surrounding you, but it was also very attractive and I figured I could use the tiny bit of exercise considering how much I was eating. Parking was ample and free (Go Vegas!) and the casino itself smells less like smoke and desperation than other casinos. . . I would recommend this buffet to anyone in Vegas who's looking for a weekend dinner but doesn't want to spend $60, or to any lushes who want the free booze!
If u wear chrome hearts, don't come here. I was asked to take off my shirt or leave cause it has fuck you on it. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? . . Alotta old timers and lil kids here maybe that's why I got flagged. The selection here at Studio B Is laughable compared to bacchanal. The food quality has went down the drain since the last time I was here about 2 years ago.. . Also there is no express lane, so even if u had dough ur gonna have to wait the whole line.. . And seafood is only available on weekends . . Would probably not come here again
There is so much hype around Studio B with billboards claiming it's the "Best Buffet IN Vegas." Best? I think not. It's $40 for weekends seafood buffet from 11am to 9pm. It is definitely not worth the $40. Take that money and go to the Wynn buffet. . . Kalbi short ribs were soooo salty. It wasn't even tolerable by downing a lot of water. I had to spit it out onto a napkin because it was just sodium overload. I got really excited when I saw the sashimi salad with huge chunks of salmon sashimi. But the salmon was hard and not buttery soft. I felt like they took it from the freezer.  The lobster bisque and chicken noodle soups were both really salty. After 2 plates of disappointment, I slowed down and stopped eating. Such a disappointment after all that hype. . . The presentation of the food definitely looks better than it tastes. I was so excited upon entering because I thought the quality & taste would be comparable to other buffets in the same price range. After a few bites, I was proven wrong. . . Only plus is all you can drink in terms of wine, beer, coffee and etc. But ehhh skip Studio B unless you're here for breakfast or a weekday lunch/dinner. $40 is just NOT worth it.
The hype this place gets is unwarranted. The crab legs look thin and flimsy, they look like they were rejected from all the other LV buffets before coming here. Granted they were cut for you but still not impressive.. . The Baked Salmon was atrocious. It was probably cooked 10 mins past. The side of the fish was dry and hard like a rock and the center tasted like canned tuna. Totally killed a delicate piece of fish. . . The deserts were also subpar the creme brulee was watery and oily. The carrot cake was dry.. . The best thing at this buffet was the gelato, vegetarian pad Thai and the fruit so that says a lot. I could understand if it was like 20 dollars but for 40 bucks you expect more. . . If you're from California save your money and gas and just go to Pala. You can pay for yourself and guest for the same as 1 here and the food will taste better.
had a great experience. my boyfriends parents are in town and wanted to go to a buffet and Studio B did not disappoint. They have a great selection of just about everything. I was sad they didnt have crab legs... those are my favorite, however the unlimited beer and wine was a great addition.. . desserts were fantastic.. overall I was very pleased and will totally be back!
Great Buffet. Beer and wine include with buffet. A lot of food items. Sweet potato salad was great.
