Ok, lets be real... the food is slightly better than average, but it's definitely the service that puts it over the top. ESPECIALLY with MARY, the waitress. She is a godsend. I only go for paris brunch where it's endless mimosas and without fail, the waitresses get you drunk. Always a good time here.
I should have ate here before the buffet at Bellagio so my rating is lower now. (Saying Bellagio was better). More choices there.. The soups are too far under the sneeze guard so you can't reach them. And there is no one attending to them so no help in getting any.. The assortment of food was not that good so I ended up going back a few times for the same dishes.. The crepe maker was good though. Delicious.. When you pay at the front, they cross out the tip portion. I guess that means leave a tip at the table?
Buffets are not my usual selections for dining in Vegas, but this one is worth mentioning.. . Be warned, there is a wait time to enter the buffet, but when you travel with friends who have VIP status, there is a seperate entrace with no wait time!  But that is not what makes this visit great for me, it is the food selection.. . I really enjoyed the variety of foods offered than the typcial iceberg salads, roasted meats, bland treats. Nope, here at the Paris Hotel they offer speciality crepes made to order, speciality salads, pastas and parisian treats. I really love the uniqueness of their food selection. You must try the wine marinated fruit... its wonderful and not intoxicating with alcohol!
Horrible! The wait is over two hours, then you wait some more inside to get the crepes. Dirty too - no one is cleaning up.
Been back twice and love it both times.
Earns a 4 star for recent improvements and better attention; however, come here expecting the longest of lines- sometimes 90 minutes to get in.. . They have a great selection of seafood, desserts, Krepes, cheese, and deli. Also, some great French styled cuisine. Service is a solid 4-star, design is also about 4 stars.. . Located right between Ballys and Paris Las Vegas, it is at the center of a lot of traffic. Come here with your Buffet of Buffets pass.
Not what I was expecting from this hotel. It was a mediocre buffet at best and it didn't take me long to put this experience in the "frustrating" category. The portion of prime rib that I recieved is what I would feed my dog.....nope, scratch that....she wouldn't have eaten it either. It was insulting to me to think that anyone would have found my portion acceptable, especially the server. He did ask me if I wanted another peice but I was already getting "that" feeling of being insulted so I told him that I didn't even want the peice that he had served me. I basically ended up eating mashed potatos that night and couldn't wait to leave. I did complain to management who offered me a complimentary breakfast but  I declined. If they can't get one meal right why would I repeat the experience. Do yourself a favor and pass this buffet. We ate at Bellagio's buffet the following night and loved, loved it. For a comparable fare, its a much better buffet and a much finer  experience.
So, I went here with people out of desperation for food. Someone who had been here before recommended it so here I was at 8 PM. Service had placed us in a corner of a room and it was very stuffy. . . In terms of the food, all I could taste was cheese, butter, and salt. I mean, I guess I expected it since it was a buffet.. Crab legs tasted funny and the soups were very oily.. . Service was interesting because I felt like their waiters waited for tips. During the time I was eating, our waiter disappeared forever and the people next to me had a huge stack of plates that was piling. No one got refills of water and the place was looking dirty. You could always see the waiter with a dish cart near by, but he just kind of stood there and stared at us through the door way - it was kind of creepy. . . The people next to us left without tipping, so after the waiter saw that, he began hawking us and constantly took away our dishes/gave us refills. There were moments where he just stood there in the room counting his money in front of us (signaling that we should give him a tip). The whole time he was doing this, the empty tables by us were still filled with stacks of dirty dishes.. . Overall, the food is sub-par and the service is creepy. :) Good luck.
Bought a groupon for 2 at lunch, great value. The food was great,  they had seafood favs and a crepe station. Service was very pleasent. I would recommend as one of the better buffets on the strip
Truly some of the best prime rib I have ever had... but here is the catch:  when we went back the next day the prime rib was not nearly as good a quality as the night before????  What the heck?. . The desserts were nothing to write home about so don't go for that.  So unimpressive I cannot even remember any of them and I checked them out twice! . . The crab legs at dinner were some of the best at a buffet ever!  They were ice cold and not sitting in hot water like I have had so many times, so they were very flavorful and not watered down.. . One of my favorite dishes was the creamy pasta with truffle oil!  Yummy flavor!. . The service both times was very good.  There was a line but I don't know how long the wait was because I got to skip the lines ;-). . It's a buffet and kinda expensive but what isn't in Vegas?  . . My recommendation is to only go once to this (and probably any) buffet on your visit to Vegas because the lunch had the exact same food as the dinner minus the crab legs!
My friend and I came on a friday for lunch and we waited about 20-30 minutes in line for the buffet. I think it was worth the wait. They had a great selection of food: seafood, meat, desserts, etc. But let me say that the crepes here are thee most delicious crepes I've ever had. The nutella one with the bananas and the hazelnuts is a must for dessert. Also, the prime rib was cooked very well and very tender. And you must have the truffle mac and cheese. I wish I found the truffle mac and cheese first because after the crepes, the prime rib and like 8 mimosas I was stuffed. About the mimosas, you can taste the champagne, but it was definitely more OJ than champagne. If you can get just champagne as your bottomless, do it. Definitely going to hit this buffet up the next time I'm in vegas.
At first when walked in, this lady that was directing my family to the table was soon rude we were almost going back out, but because we did not want to look for another buffet we stayed.  The food was good my favorite for lunch was the crepe and we had an amazing server Mary she was supper nice.....
