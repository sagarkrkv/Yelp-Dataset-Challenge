Pros: A deal for families and those traveling on a budget. Its located just of the strip and it is close enough to all attractions. It has a circus area full of carnival attractions and games. It has a decent buffet.. . Cons: Our tub faucet leaked all night. We had to close the bathroom door because it was so loud. DO NOT PARTAKE IN THE HOTEL PROMOTIONS IN THE LOBBY. THEY ARE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF YOU. DO NOT GO TO THE POLO TOWERS.
Pros:  . . 1.  Great place to take the kiddos.. 2.  Cheap room rates.. 3.  Circus acts and games for kids and adults where you can win prizes.. 4.  Tables and slots are decent.. 5.  Adventuredome. . Negatives:. . 1.  Casino is old and dirty.. 2.  Awful buffet.. 3.  Rooms are dated especially compared to other hotels on the strip.. . Overall, it is okay.  We will always come here if we have our nieces and nephews with us cause they love the place as I once did.  If you have no kids, then do not come here.  It is too much of a "circus".
Do yourself a favor and stay away from Circus Circus. I made a reservation tonight for 4 nights. Casino manager refuse to take my money on my temporary bank card and inflate the price ridiculously. Told me that if I didn't like I can go somewhere else. I had a relative who for works for them. Well if they treat customers that bad then you should imagine how they treat their own employees. This should be a lesson for everyone, just because it cheaper that does not make it better. I told the casino shift manager and gave him my players card. I am not doing anymore business with ALL MGM Resorts Casinos. You treat people they way you would want to be treated. Anything less doesn't deserve your business.
For $28, I'm not sure my expectations were ever very high.  This is the kind of place where you can hear your neighbors having late-night sex (wait, that's probably just Vegas), the pillows smell like they haven't been thoroughly washed, and you see high-heeled girls getting into dark pimped-out cars at 6am.  But it's cheap, and the kids love the Midway - we spent an entire afternoon playing the games there, helped out by $5 off each person's ticket that came with our hotel room. The gambling itself is OK, and we didn't try any of the food.  It set us back about $15 each time we cabbed to either the main part ofthe strip or old town Vegas, so you have to factor that into your overall cost (it's a 3+ mile walk otherwise, in a not so great part of town).  Would I come back?  Well, it depends on what kind of vacation I wanted.  For a total experience, probably a nicer hotel would be my choice, but if I want to optimize for spending my money gambling or shopping, I have no pride about staying in a place like this - why not?  Just turn the pillow over - the other side is probably cleaner.
Highlights: Pizza and Merlot delivered to 18th floor, hot and delicious. Nice towels and decent beds. Great view at sunset, sunrise. Good enough workout room (2nd Floor). Water pressure for shower is fine.. . Slight disappointments: Bedding material rough. Toilet flushes like a rocket being shot into space, kaboom! Scary every time. Decor is old.. . Eek! Me thinks not: Smell, carpet very dirty, Kuereg coffee machine burned on bottom, made plain water brown, then yellow, then light yellow. Unusable, carcinogens :P. Billing was confusing, accidentally canceled reservations, then re-booked at higher rate :P Refused to roll back. Casino itself is dated, boring. Customer service phone calls are impossible. Simply trying to get a damn copy of the bill. No transfer to billing services. Called 855 275 5733 -- on hold eternally (on hold throughout my writing of this!) . Room Service: each request was incorrectly fulfilled (asked for new coffee maker, brought towels and soap -- every morning, incorrect).. . Wi-Fi under-powered, no service until 2am - 6am.. -----. Never again,. Jack. PS Still on hold
Yuck, worst hotel ever. TONS of kids who should not be up with their drunk parents at 1 am. I feel bad for them and it kind of gives the whole place a sad feeling. If you plan on not spending any time in your room other than to crash, then this place is good. Also, be prepared to take the bus because it is too far to walk to the ACTUAL strip, aka, the place to party. It cost me and my friends $47 each which is insanely cheap. So all in all I dont regret staying here.  If you have a little more to spend, get a better hotel. It is a lil' depressing in this place. Parents, dont take your babies out to Vegas and let me run into you as I stumble out of the club, not appropriate.
Some people complain about Circus Circus being full of kids. If that's you, go to the Wynn, Vdara or someplace else. But if you have kids, this is the place for you. They can keep busy all day in the Adventuredome or the Midway that surrounds the circus act area. McDonald's is right there too, should they get hungry. . . Now for us big folks, there are a number of restaurants and watering holes to choose from, both at the mezzanine level and on the casino floor. The rooms? Well, the West Tower rooms are fairly nice but please stay away from the Manor. That is just a bunch of old motel rooms that are somewhat removed from the main facility. The only advantage to the Manor is that you can park your car next to your room and you don't have to schlep your luggage very far. But now that most luggage comes with wheels, that shouldn't be much of an issue. The nicer rooms are only a few dollars more, and worth it.. . Now here's a secret just for you. Don't tell anyone else, OK? Pull your car into Garage 1 and find a parking place on Level 3 (Green). That way you won't have to take the elevator; just walk right through the doors onto the Promenade level, turn right and take the escalator down to the casino level, another right or two and you'll be at the front desk. The elevators servicing the West Tower are close by, too. Very convenient.  . . OK, it's not the swankiest hotel in town. It's not even swanky. But the facility is decent, the prices are great and it's probably the most kid-friendly hotel outside of Disneyland.
I feel itchy just thinking about this place. . . I remember when I was a little one my parents brought me and my younger brother here. I thought it was the greatest place I had ever seen, with the little amusement park and the carnival games and circus acts. We had our RV hooked up in the lot. It was the mid 90's. A simpler time.. . I've stayed here more than once quite recently when me and my girl were ballin on a budget. Even from the outside it's like... I'm having second thoughts about this. Okay, Just... fork out the extra money and stay somewhere that say, cleans their bedspreads and curtains sometimes, or, vacuums the room occasionally. Circus Circus does not do these things ever.. . Even wallking through the casino you get the most disgusting, creepy, dirty feeling. And also the feeling like you are going to be murdered. By clowns. Basically you get the dirty feeling because the place is dirty in all ways, shapes, and forms. It's really a sad place. It's like a carnival tent that someone abandoned and left to rot. And it smells that way. Like shit, mold, stale cigs and despair.. . The few times (a few too many) that I've stayed here, the check in line has been long. I actually let a bride and groom at the end of the line cut in front of me when I was next up one time. Hey, Circus Circus has to do with some part of their wedding. It was the least I could do. The people that work the front desk are depressed. And I would be too if someone made me wear that stanky ass purple uniform. Bless their hearts. They also must give you a map and explain to you which way to go and which elevator you need to take to find your room. The layout of the place is horrendous. I've been lost a few times. And, you don't wanna be lost here. Like I said, it's creepy.. . On your adventure to find your room, you will be forced through hallways of stands with pushy people trying to sell you a bunch of made in China crap. Like a flea market from hell. Walk quiclky, head down, through this mess. It's the only way you'll make it. . . The ventilation is SO BAD. Honestly I think if you had asthma and stayed here you would die. . . I can't even imagine that people dare to eat here. I give you props for your bravery. They do have a Krispy Kreme, which is actually one plus.. . You will have to taxi or drive to get anywhere desirable. The location of this place is really terrible. Plus, you will be embarassed to tell the taxi driver to take you back here. If you wanna go see some tits, Sapphire is pretty close. Not walking distance close, but close enough. . . Really, you could not pay me to stay here. NEVER AGAIN.
I got conned into staying here once by my friend Tierney.  She lost all of her money gambling drunk and couldn't pay for her suite at the Cosmo.  I stayed here for one night and it was awful.  I felt like I was sleeping in an early 1920's tenement apartment in the Lower East Side of New York City.  The steaks were cheap and the kids were obnoxious.  Never again.
I can remember when Las Vegas went through their "family friendly" phase. Most of the popular hotels featured motion simulator rides, IMAX theaters, really stocked arcades, free "tamer" shows, and the like.. . After "The Hangover" came out, Vegas ran with their "What Happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" campaign, and the family phase was phased out. No more simulator rides, arcades fell to neglect. No more G/PG rates free shows and attractions. So these days, to take children and teens to Vegas is a true challenge.. Enter Circus Circus, the only hotel that the younger set has a decent chance at surviving during their Vegas stint. This is moreso due to a very nice amusement park and the ongoing circus acts.. . But not all is good in Circus Circus Land. Here's the break down:. . GOOD: The amusement park is a nice bargain. There's enough there to entertain toddlers to teens. I really enjoyed the two roller-coasters, and I'm thankful that Circus Circus is the only hotel on the Strip that still has motion simulator rides. Also, the circus act continue to be a nice add-on. It features great stunts of balance and high-flying acrobatics, and it's a consistent venue that's close to McDonalds.. . BAD: Kids like buffets, and so do families with kids. But the Circus Circus's buffet is subpar. Yes, it will do the job of getting food into empty bellies, but with so many better buffets on the Strip, and a $17 dinner cost, I'm expecting much more, and better quality. Kudos to the pasta bar; easily the best part of the buffet.. The hotel is also way down at the end of things. It's bordered by a vacant lot that has been vacant for years, and the lot is a few blocks long. At night, it's empty, very dark, and eerie walking south from Circus Circus to the main element of the Strip. There are also some unsavory characters hanging out in the area.. . UGLY: Smoke ventilation is horrible. As a non-smoker, I could feel the nicotine doing a number on my lungs. Circus Circus is an older hotel, and they've really neglected their ventilation system. It's so bad that you can cut through the smoke-odor with a knife. This is bad news for children and their young, developing lungs.. . All and all, I'm recommending Circus Circus for families with children only because there's no longer any other family-friendly hotels on the Strip (including Excalibur). And while the amusement park and the circus are great touches, families need to be wary of the location, the poor buffet and especially the poor ventilation.
