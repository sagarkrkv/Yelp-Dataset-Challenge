The Pancakes are to die for!!!!!........ Nick (the owner) is a warm host. So glad I found this place for BF when in Vegas........
I was a little concerned with my husband's suggestion to leave our Strip hotel and head off the beaten path for breakfast. But co-yelpers didn't let us down. No wait at 9 am on Super Bowl Sunday morning. The staff was friendly and although the seats were on what I'd call plastic lawn chairs, the place was ok. Don't expect a gourmet breakfast, but by using an iPhone app, our server got our order correct and it was served quickly. My hubby had pancakes and loved them!  I had an egg & cheese sandwich on toast and it was like something I could make at home, but it was good. The home fries weren't my favorite, but overall we would say it was worth it.  A $20 check instead of $50 on the strip. :-)
Great food, great staff, a must to stop while in Vegas!!! Most all items are made from scratch and the owner is a wealth of fascinating knowledge and facts. Talking with him during our breakfast was a delight!
I went to have chicken salad at this place but it turned out to be one of the worst salads I have ever had. . . Reviews in YELP shows many positive feedback but I am pretty sure they are all related to the burgers and omelettes served at this place.. . Ideally a salad should be served as per the room temperature and if it says grilled chicken then it should be freshly made and warm. At this place when the server brought my salad it was freezing cold even the grilled chicken. It seems they just bought this salad from some kind of freezer. This proves that they do not make it fresh, all veggies are preserved even the chicken must be old. It was so bad that I returned back the entire salad. Didn't asked money back as they should always know through customer feedback so that they would really think about improving their standards.. . Seriously guys what it takes to make a simple salad? Please work on basics and then go for the main course.. . Not recommended to anyone if they are going for health food at this place.
Stopped by for breakfast. Was welcomed in warmly by the employees. I ordered the French toast combo. Comes with four slices of French toast. Three eggs. Hash browns. And three slices of bacon. Everything came out perfect. Not greasy or over salted. I highly recommend trying this place. It's my new breakfast stop.
I had the French toast and bacon with coffee, the food was just wonderful and the entire staff was attentive and helped each other with anything their tables needed. Will definitely come back soon!
For anyone that is in Vegas and wants a home made breakfast that is good in taste and on price must try this place. Every time I'm in town is a must!!
Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.. . Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama! . . . Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!. and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!. . Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!
The food was very tasty, and the blue tones in the restaurant were very soothing.
We were looking for a good breakfast at lunch time and found it by the reviews on Yelp!  Mr. Mamas cooks breakfast all day and really knows what he's doing.  . . We were greeted at the door by the owner, who was very nice.  He also came to our table and all of the others to make sure everyone was happy. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. The restaurant was clean. . . I ordered the meat and cheese omelet with hash browns and was not disappointed.  The food was fantastic and not greasy like some of the chain breakfast places.  Just know that you get a lot of food on your plate. . . My husband ordered the "Mama stack" (3 pancakes, 3 eggs and a meat) and a side of hash browns not knowing how big the pancakes were. It took all he had to finish his meal!  The pancakes alone would have been enough for him.  . . Both of our meals were great!  It was very much like eating at home and we will definitely return when we are in Vegas.
Had a great breakfast with the wife. Very friendly staff and the owner even gave us his Greek luck to win a million dollar. How could you go wrong with that.
We stopped in when in town for work, looking for an affordable place to get breakfast.  It was under $20 for two huge breakfasts with coffee.  The food was good, and the manager/owner stopped by our table and was very friendly.  It certainly had a small town feel.   The staff was so polite and helpful!  They have cheap plastic patio chairs, inside but I won't hold that against them because everything else was spot on.
This is spot is a good mash-up of fun subtleties mixed with non-nonsense breakfasting. Between the fun, tatted-up staff and the plastic chairs at the tables, you get the feeling that this almost more of a family backyard breakfast than your typical restaurant. They keep it simple, yet comfortable, with their decor but they definitely deliver with their food. . . What we ordered: Biscuits and Gravy & Chicken fried steak.. . One tip: They will offer but if you're not sure: try their gravy. It is absolutely delicious but it is loaded with sausage and the taste is a bit different than other places might have. Be adventurous, just go it and you will likely love it too....but if you're the type who likes to test the waters first....request a sample.. . Long story short: if you're like me, on the rare occasion you go out for breakfast....you're all about taste and comfort food. Well, here's your spot. Just maybe....uhhh....make sure you have some room for post-breakfast relaxation/sleep....you may need it. lol
The burrito was amazing, everything else was mediocre... Eggs cold, hash browns cold and not very crispy, gravy was bland. . . Service was slow but attentive. Overall it was a positive and I would go back.
I love this place!  Delicious (and I mean delicious) food, solid service and great prices...you can't go wrong.  The owner explained that 90% of the food is from scratch, and you can taste it.  I got the Cali omelette, once with potatoes and once with hash browns, and a pancake, and everything was perfect.  (If you get anything that comes with pico de gallo, ask for extra. It's made from scratch and is some of the best I've ever tasted.)  I'll never come close to Vegas without eating here!
Awesome! In the order that I received... Host, the owner greets you and seats you, wonderful gentleman. Waitress fast, friendly, knowledgeable. Food, big portions, omelet standard 4 eggs, hash browns crunchy on the outside soft inside, bacon crispy and amazingly not oily! Sausage delicious and also not greasy! Fresh toast very good. Price, super affordable, you can afford to loose a few more hands at the casinos.  Definitely our to go to spot for breakfast anytime of the day!. . I think they cook their bacon on a George Foreman cause it's super crunchy and not greasy at all!
Excellent food abd service!! The Denver omelette was superb, coffee and French toast were fantastic. We are definitely fortunate to have found this place. Kudos!!
Loved the breakfast!!! The omlet was made to perfection and had super fresh ingredients. The coffee was wonderful and AWESOME service! I don't come to Vegas often but when I do I have to come here for breakfast. This place is the bomb!!!
Nothing special about food . But the service is excellent. Well.  The owner is excellent . Some of the staff looked like they wanted to kill themselves
First time here. Stopped here early morn(6am) for a trip from California to Colorado .. Good food, quick service and a very friendly staff.
Breakfast was great!  Ordered the Western Omelet, the eggs were so fluffy and the hash brown was crispy to perfection.  The best experience of coming here was the atmosphere and the serve.  The owner greets U at the door and is so friendly.  A definite place to visit when were in town.  Don't forget to order the cinnamon roll and biscuit and gravy, a must have!!!
Yelp reviews led us to this breakfast spot today.  No exaggeration, this was our best meal in Las Vegas.  Incredibly friendly service, fantastic food.  Nothing to look at, but when you dig into the gooey cinnamon roll you won't be able to pay attention to anything but your taste buds.  Holy cow.. Eggs were fluffy and not greasy.  Pancakes were equally fluffy, and flavorful.  Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly.. I'm grateful this place is not local to me.  If I lived within 50 miles of this place I'd gain 50 pounds in a week.. Oh, and did I mention all this - two entrees, two drinks and a cinnamon roll made by the Tasty Fairy herself- all for $22.  It was their valentines day special.. Treat yourself.  Worth the car rental to get here.
Visiting from California my husband and I wanted to try something different than your average Casino food.   Thank God we found this place.  It is about a 10 min drive from the strip but so worth it.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by who seemed to be the owner and the welcoming was awesome.  This place definitely strives for great customer service.  I ordered the French Toast and my husband orderd the Veggie omelet.  Both very delicious.  Very affordable.
By far best customer service I've seen in long time!!! . . Prices on the menu were great!! Not overpriced just about right! You Get good portions for your money!! . . They try to get you in and out as fast as possible and that's great!! . Food is good not steak food quality but your not going to a steak food joint! Very impressed overall with everything def coming back!!
First time coming here and there's a 35 min wait... good sign for a breakfast place. The hostess was very nice and polite. The servers were attentive and nice as well. The food got to our table quite fast for being very busy. I got the chicken fried steak and my gf got the French toast. It was very delish. Their country gravy was flavorful, the Eggs were cooked to my preference, and the serving portions were very adequate. The coffee was a lil weak, but I'm used to my dark coffee. Overall it's a place that we would come back to.
It was time for brunch! I love reconnecting with folks you don't usually get to see.  Brunch is an amazing place and time to reconnect!  On this day, I was to meet with two friends who live at different ends of the valley from myself.  I live in Henderson, along the I-95, another friend lives downtown and the other lives in Southern Highlands.  We needed to find a joint in the middle.  Nothing better than an opportunity to use the good 'ole Yelp app to find a stellar joint!  When I pulled this place up, I noticed that there were 400+ reviews with an overall rating of 4 1/2 stars.  In my book, that's amazing!  . . The first thing I though of when I arrived was that it's located in a very awkward strip mall.  The mall consists of auto detailing shops and auto parts shops.  Then there's Mr. Mama's, a brunch joint opened until 2pm.  When I walked in, there was 30 minute wait.  Smaller place, compared to other brunch joints in the valley, however, it was quaint and homey.  Another thing you notice are the blue walls.  Holy moly, that's a lot of blue. Must have been a really popular color to the owner.  The table tops are usual 4-seaters, decorated with blues, yellows and greys.  Our server was young and super sweet.  She was pretty attentive the entire time and was super personable.  . . For brunch, I got a couple of things.  The first thing was the Western Omelet for $7.50.  This 4-egg omelet was stuffed with sausage, mushrooms, peppers and green onions.  This dish comes with your choice of potatoes, I chose hash browns, and also came with your choice of toast (mine was wheat).  The omelet was huge!  Full of flavorful sausage, chopped red peppers offered festive color and the hash browns were nicely fried.  The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and delicious.  The only think I noticed was that there was a lot of oil on the bottom of my potatoes and eggs.  So great but a little greasy.  I would still recommend this, though!  My second brunch item was the full stack of pancakes for $5.75.  It was 3 pancakes stacked with butter and maple syrup.  The cakes were light and fluffy, pleasantly fragranced with buttermilk.  Nothing beats a good pancake for brunch!  Everyone should also add this on to their meal :). . All in all, I definitely see the hype to the ratings.  I will definitely be back for more in the future.  This is a great place, centrally located and offers a great menu for brunch.  If you're in the area and you don't check this place out, consider yourself missing out!!
Like most restaurants in Vegas outside of the Strip, this place is in a strip mall. I came here with my sisters and brother in law back in October. (I know, such a late review, but at least I'm getting to it now!) We arrived here for breakfast on our last day in Vegas. It's a very unassuming place but it was absolutely delicious. We shared a few things. Their famous fried rice, I can't remember the name right now... and it was phenomenal. Now, I will always think that my papa's fried rice is the best but this place came pretty close, and that is a huge compliment! We also got their red velvet pancakes. It tasted like we were just eating the cupcake in pancake form... needless to say, you should get it too. We also got a small order of their lemon ricotta. These were only meh, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise, absolutely fantastic little place with great prices!
Had Monday morning breakfast here and there was no wait at 8am.  Typical American style breakfast, no frills, no specialty items.. . I agree with others in that service here is excellent.  Servers are nice, prompt and attentive.  Coffee was decent and servers make sure your cup is always full.  Portions are generous.. . Veggie omelet:  ordered only egg whites with very little oil, and they did a good job with it.  Came with cottage cheese, which I like, and toast.. . Steak and eggs: smallish piece of steak but not sure we really should be eating more than that.   Hash browns were crisp but tasted greasy.. . They gave us a fresh cup of coffee to go when we asked for a cup for our current coffee --  that was nice of them!
Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.
I am a Dodger fan and I love the color blue, but man, this place has blue EVERYTHING!. Pleasant waitstaff. Quick to be seated, to take our drink order, our breakfast order, return with the food, and to get our bill. We only browsed the breakfast menu. I loved the hash browns.The portions were filling and cooked to order. There was a TV to watch sports/news. I would be back again for a quick and delicious breakfast.
Looked this restaurant up on Yelp from our hotel in Las Vegas, and was seated within minutes upon our arrival! The staff and service was great and the food was delicious, and that was just the first day! The whole family came back the next day and loved it which is a testament to the establishment.  Kudos to Jenna, Claudia and Nick the owner, who came to our table to check in with us. We will definitely be back to sample the lunch menu, next time. Great stuff!
I have visited Las Vegas many times and found a breakfast place that has good service and good food. The host will ask how is everything and they come around to refill your coffee. We came back the next day again for breakfast and should have come back a third time but wanted to try a new place. Big mistake. I'm looking forward to my return trip to LV and going to Mr Mama's.
Nothing special about the food (got the breakfast burrito and french toast).   It's just solid, well executed with no surprises.    Owner is around and greets tables so you know they run a tight ship.    I would also avoid lunch time due to the wait.   . . If you are looking for something special or more unique, I'd go to Hash House.    This place is more like more upscale version of Waffle House.
This is our fav place for breakfast pickup, it's far from us but the service and prices are on point :) has a small family feel and no frills. Good food at great prices that's it. It is in an unusual part of town (industrial area), not a place to come to for the environment.
Highly recommend this place! Best chili I've ever had! Great pancakes and gravy. And the service was great.
Thanks Yelp people... . Good food.  We had chicken fried steak, breakfast burritos, and pancakes.  Fairly priced - for Vegas - and very busy on Sunday morning.  Food is solid.  I wish they had some real maple syrup for the pancakes for the kids...  Oh well.  now kids go finish those bacon.. :)
This place has simply the best pancakes i have ever had in my life. Service was quick and friendly.
We came by after seeing positive reviews on yelp. We were here for one day from Los Angeles and wanted a reasonable and delicious breakfast. We were blown away by the friendly staff, amazingly welcoming owner, and high quality food and service. We got breakfast burritos which were really tasty and had an incredibly pleasant experience. We will be back!!
Friendly and efficient customer service.  Food was delicious.  Nothing fancy just good fresh tasty food.
