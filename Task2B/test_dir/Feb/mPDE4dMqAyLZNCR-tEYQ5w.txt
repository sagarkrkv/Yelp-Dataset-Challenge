This show was very much a let down for me. I could see the story they were going for, however, it failed to all come together for me. I felt there was a lot of things happening that wasn't really part of what was going on. . . When the show starts out, there's no real explanation as to why this is happening. As the story progresses, you understand the point but, it doesn't make sense. . . As far as the costumes, they were good and fitting for the show. I also was hoping for more tricks or acrobatics. I was a fan of Mystere, and expected some of those type talents. . . I will say, the stage is amazing. Watching it transform into many things for the show was so intriguing. And there was also a part with the girl in the forest type setting with a guy and that dancing was pretty cool. . . All in all, I wouldn't recommend this show. Pass and watch something more entertaining.
Yes, it was a little disappointing that the Battle scene wasn't live.  I understand the circumstances and that you can't just simply change the ending, but I was waiting for a big finish!  But, the show really impressed me.  The story was followable and the acts were great.  This was my first Cirque experience and I wasn't too sure what to expect - the stage and theater were really impressive to me! I don't think you'll find a stage like this anywhere else.  I walked out of the show wishing it was longer and wanting to go see some of the other ones!. . Just an FYI: I booked my tickets through a Living Social promo that redirected me to the MGM ticket site.  The tickets were only like $65 a piece. The map on the website showed that our seats were in the first row of the 200s sections, near the middle of the theater.  However, when we picked them up, our tickets were completely backwards and instead of being in the middle, we were on the very end which made it difficult to see.  So, next time, I would call to make sure the seats were actually as advertised.
Went to see Ka tonight and I have to admit, did not "get it." In addition, I could not follow the story. In fact, I'm not even sure there is a story. The stage and theater are fantastic. In fact, the further you sit back, I think the better. The performers are good, but honestly, I didn't see anything that totally blew me away as far as acrobatics. The best part was the music, which was excellent. I was excited and eager to see Ka, but I feel disappointed by the experience.
KA was spectacular. Story driven (though sometimes difficult to really follow) with an amazing transforming stage. Some truly exciting moments. BUT... Last year, a performer died during the final climactic battle. A rope broke and she fell. So instead of using better ropes, which the rest of the show does, they filmed the final battle and project it onto the surface of this vertical wall. The projection is a bit blurry and low quality. It brings the excitement level of the show to a screeching halt! Completely leaves a bad taste in your mouth and taints the entire experience. They should come up with something new or remove the scene entirely.. . Bottom line, as a buyer you should be aware of this.  Everything leading up to the finale was great, but this really was a huge letdown.  Especially given the cost of the event, the entire production should be top-notch and this portion felt like a band-aid rather than something they put effort into fixing.
Another truly amazing Cirque show that needs to be seen.  The acts in this show, I believe, are the most dangerous acts I've seen in all the Cirque shows in Vegas.  The mastery of skills that were on display during the show is just incredible to watch.  The athleticism required toperform the stunts leaves me speechless.
What a great show. If you are expecting the typical acrobatic show, then this isn't for you. The story was great and very easy to follow. The transitions between acts were great. Some of the acts gave me that tingling sensation. The princess with the flute twirling was one of my favorites. How do you do that every night without messing up. The princess with the jungle guy swing act was very beautifully done as well. The first battle scene with the bad guys running up the wall was pretty sweet. The last guy to fall off, man was my heart pounding for him. The stage was so amazing. I wonder what happens to all that sand, and what do the people fall on. . . The only part I didn't like was the final battle scene. I mean I get it, one of the performers passed away during this scene, but it doesn't mean you bring the show down hill. As a big production show, I expected Cirque du Soleil to find an alternative way to display this act. Just using a projector doesn't make sense, and I think it is a slap in the face to the audience as well as the performers. Please fix this act, it is suppose to be the EPIC CLIMACTIC BATTLE!
Saw this show two years ago and I think this is one of the better shows on the Las Vegas strip. The other would be Mystere at Treasure Island.. . This show is great, the storyline is simple and the visuals are spectacular. Make sure to see this show if you get the chance.. . You will not be disappointed.
This was my first first cirque du soleil show and I loved it! This performance seemed more like a story/theater type rather than just a bunch of acrobatics. Our favorite scene was the jumping around on those spinning wheels. I swear we though the guy was going to fall!!. . I took 1 star away because the ending scene was all video. There was a whole dramatic scene that lead to the final scene.. then all of a sudden it's video!! . . Other than that, the show is great and my boyfriend enjoyed it as well. Lots of fight scenes for guys to enjoy :). . btw. Look for deals cuz they're out there!! I found a winter deal through Google which lead me to the mgm site and got tickets for only 55 each! We were in the 200 section in the middle left  which was still a great spot to watch the show because you don't want to sit up close otherwise you're in that awkward looking up position. Back middle is where you wanna be!! Anywhere in the 200s
Worst show I have ever seen. Waste of money!
I'm not going to lie, I fell asleep maybe 3 times. It was hard to keep my eyes open. I don't know if it was from lack of sleep, drinking all day or just pure boredom. I'm gonna go with probably pure boredom since when I looked around the people to the right, left, front and behind were all sleeping. RIDICULOUS for a Cirque Du Soleil show. The story line was somewhat hard to follow. Alot of battles and fighting. I thought there would be more acrobatics and just anything to make my jaw drop and go WOW! Glad I only spent $66 on my tickets on smartervegas.com. . . I've seen Zumanity and that was a WOW show,definitely recommend that over KA. KA is more of a broadway type of show than anything.
This was our first Cirque show. We had 2 free tickets from playing myvegas. It was good at times and boring at other times.  I felt like it dragged on too much. I am glad I went once but that's enough.  **tip, sit towards the middle or back of the theater.  We sat in the front but felt we missed out on some of the show as the actors came from the back and side we kept having to turn around.
Came here for the 7pm showing on Sunday. This is my 6th cirque show. Prices were good; I called to get discount pricing on Saturday and there were no other options (other than military, student, and AAA discounts, which weren't much). I'm used to paying locals price because I used to have a friend that loved here and we got our tickets at 2 for 1 pricing. Since then, I've refused to pay more than $100 for tickets because I know they come cheaper. Total came out to around $65, inclusive of taxes. . . They say to come an hour early to pick up tickets from will call. Unlike all of the cirque shows I've seen, the line was so short at the booth and there was no line to get in the theater. Overall, the theater was maybe less than half full. Also, it's a small-ish theater. We had category E tickets and were only sitting 4th row up from the middle of the theater. Even the back row didn't look awfully far. . . To be honest, Ka has one of the most impressive theaters that I've seen. They made really good use of the spaces on the walls by adorning them with lights and cool little balconies. A lot of the acrobats also used them in their scenes. The seats are all equipped with their own speaker behind your head, so the sound effects and music were pretty amazing though it was hard to hear the actors (even IF they are speaking a different language). . . Story line was pretty straightforward, but I was about to fall asleep during many parts of this show. People are right when they're saying there isn't much acrobatics involved. I also felt a lot of the stunts were repeated tricks from some other shows (the giant wheel thing that is also in Zarkana was way more "cling-to-the-edge-of-your-seat" and the aerial dancers were more engaging and varied in their athletics in TOTEM). A lot of the athletics reminded me of high school marching band color guard teams. Baton twirling and stick twirling were a good amount of the tricks they showed. . . Though the stage WAS cool, I feel like it was overused in a sense that you could tell they wanted to keep using it and rotating it to keep the show interesting. I got bored of it after a while. The end woke me up (don't want to give a spoiler alert) and it was my favorite part in the show just because the the safety of the actors and patrons in the theater... That definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, ready to evacuate in a timely manner... Haha. . 3 stars because of the costumes and actors, established story line, neat theater, and good sound. Minus two for the lackluster acrobatics, quiet dialogue, and repetitive rotating stage use.
Having seen pretty much all of the other cirque du soleil shows now, this show was slightly disappointing. . . Located in MGM, I believe this is one of the older shows. The theatre itself is beautifully constructed with bright walkways on both sides. Before the show begins, fireballs are constantly spitting out of the center the the stage area and was pretty cool! We sat in the center third row and got an extremely good view of everything without craning our necks or straining our eyes. A lot of the performances seemed to take place on this stage that was flexible to become a ship, a beach, a wall, and all sorts of other set ups which was pretty cool. . My favorite scene was probably the shadow puppets they made ( super cute) and also when they were chasing each other around on the platform with the spikes poking through the floor. Otherwise, most of the scenes I really cannot remember too well since they all blended together. Some of the costumes and decorations reminded me of my ancient chinese dramas. There was one last part that they showed using some type of projection I think instead of acting due the death of their actress during the performance so that was a good move on their part to make it safer for their performers.
Deep in our hearts, we all have the love for ancient mystery, superior athleticism, spectacular fashion, exotic music, and a grandiose drama with happy ending.  Cirque Du Soleil is such a successful form of entertainment because it gives all in one.  And KA is a fantastic example.. . I'm not going to give away the story since it will spoil the fun.  I simply love it.  The technology that seamlessly transformed the theme from land to water to mountain was breathtakingly amazing.  The acrobats and aerialists pleased the crowds as expected.  Ancient Chinese martial arts and weapon play were also successfully inserted into the show.  The only part of the show I didn't like too much was when projected movie technology was used to depict a section of the story.  I want tosee everything in real act, not screen projection.. . The retail store next to the show is also worthy visiting.  I was excited to see the exclusive collection by Desigual (a colorful, bohemian Spanish apparel line) for KA.  This was undoubtedly a perfect marriage between fashion and entertainment.  I loved the asymmetrically cut and printed knit dresses.  If you like masks, you'll find some cool ones here too.  . . KA is appropriate for kids too. . . I give four stars only because O was perfect if I have to compare the two.
Spectacular, highly recommended! And so much more than your typical Cirque show. The production skills and prep that come along with the performance will just blow your mind. . . The circus isn't what it used to be! . . I would suggest sitting on the ground level so you can see all the action taking place (some of which will take place in your rows!) - there's A LOT of action and several story lines going on at once so best to be close, be awake and paying attention so you're not lost halfway through the show!. . Anyone into martial arts or the opera will love this. And the technology behind each set is just unbelievable.
The storyline was endearing and easy to follow. They did a very good job bringing to life the sweet innocence of manga that I used to read. The acrobatics were amazing. And the stage!! So impressive! The whole thing moves! We were front row dead center, and almost got kicked- that's how active and off stage the actors go at times! We did have to crane our necks straight up when the arial feats occurred, so I do recommend sitting farther back. The auditorium is amazing to see- get there early to enjoy it all. The climatic end was not live at our showing- due to the recent tragedy that befell Ka. I was told they will be playing the final battle scene on film until they can come up with a new, safer, final battle scene for their actors. Ka is my favorite show on the strip due to the amazing acrobatics, the sweet storyline, excellent costumes, comical relief, stunning setting, and excellent performing! My favorite scene was the running up the near vertical stage to get away from the arrows and bad guys. Second is O- so do go to both!
What was this show? After the wonderful experience we'd had at Zarkana, I was more than glad to shell about almost $300 on tickets for my mom and I to enjoy this even closer. When I think Cirque du Soliel, I think the height of human gymnastics and acrobatics, beauty and the wonders of the body. . . The show starts off pretty promising. There's a lot of fancy pole work, extravagant tumbling, and spinning. And then it stops. It then becomes all about the impressive technical aspects and stationary visuals. Giant moving tables and great music and costumes..... But they rely too much on prefilmed visuals and not enough on what makes CdS the wonderful powerhouse it had been know to be like. . . I realize not everyone can be on their A game always, but the jump roping rotating figure-8  guy just gave up midway through his routine. Since I could never do anything remotely like that, I won't hold that against him. . . The story itself read pretty awful too. It read like a K-drama.  It felt like whole sections were missing.
After seeing "O" I had high expectations. And let me tell you, I was totally let down. Yes there was some neat parts to the show, but for me, I wasn't expecting a "story line" - I was expecting to be wowed by all the acrobatic tricks and extravagant gymnastics and I left feeling jilted. The sets were beautiful, but I just didn't love the performance. Hopefully my next Cirque show won't disappoint.
Don't understand the hype about this show. When I think of Cirque du Soleil- I think circus and fun acrobatic acts. KA was nothing like I imagined. . . The only memorable parts about the show: The theater and the set & the scene when they're drowning in the water. That's it. . . Everything else was a disappointment. I tried really hard to follow the story, but I had no idea what was going on. Each act was SO boring... baton twirling, shadows of animals using hands, jumproping on wheels... not impressed. I also felt like so many mistakes were made throughout the show. A lot of the scenes with groups of people were not in sync. Toward the end, there was a scene that was entirely digital. I felt like I was watching a bad quality video game for 15 minutes. I've seen many Cirque shows, and this is my LEAST favorite. . . I am so glad I got these tickets for free. I do not recommend paying for this show, especially if you are expecting acrobatic acts.
Can't say this was captivating. Convoluted, hard to follow plot. A lot of sword fighting and crawling around on a big rotating platform. I found myself more interested in the mechanics of the stage platform, some impressive hydraulics, then the actual show going on. Looked at my watch every ten minutes. Show is about 90 minutes but crawls. Best part was the guy at the very end, doing jump rope on the big rotating wheel. Other than that, not much to see here.
I was really expecting a world class show.   Was very disappointed.. Very hard to follow the story line,. Was very disjointed.   I almost got up and left.   Set was awesome but the very poor quality video toward the end was ridiculous.. Don't waste your time or money, go see zumanity instead.
I want to give Ka a great review because I love Cirque, but quite honestly, I wasn't even sure this was a part of Cirque -- I was questioning myself about an hour into the show!  Boring, slow, the dancers' moves are anything but impressive.  Not sure if this is because of the death last year, but I would skip this show.. . We left early during our performance, we were just "bored", it was very disappointing.  There is a story line, but it's very slow and not impressive.  There were sword "fights" that were emulated, but even they were really unimpressive and looked amatuer.  My husband summed this up very well, "Typically when you see a Cirque show, you leave feeling completely inadequate physically.  You see how these performers push their bodies into an art and realize how unfit you are."  This show did *not* do that in any way.  In fact, one of the main characters is an overweight woman that watches the children.  Yep, I could've done better.
Zumanity ruined me for other cirque shows. Ka is about exactly the same as Mystere. Decent but not amazing.
Great night in Vegas. KA was definitely an amazing show and well worth the investment. The stage was magical and very unique. I was left wanting more and more. The performers were great and obviously take their job very seriously. I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Vegas.
