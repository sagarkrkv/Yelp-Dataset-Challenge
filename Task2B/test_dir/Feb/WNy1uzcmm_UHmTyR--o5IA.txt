We have lived next door to this place for over 2 years before we ever ate here. WTF were we thinking, this place is AWESOME! Great Service! Great Food! Oggie is my favorite. Salmon is fantastic and the bread is delicious! We always have seen a lot of people over there and now we know why.
Went for great craft beer. Had a great pasty too. Decent service. Clearly popular with the ASU students. Worth stopping by if you are in the area.
Great atmosphere, staff and awesome food!
Great food! They have a lot of meat and vegetarian options, and provide a different food option than most places around here. Great customer service and delicious beer options too! The only way I could like it more is if it had a little more lighting inside and outside.
What can I say? I absolutely adore this place. Its a local legend!. . We shut it down every Tuesday and Thursday night in Grad School. The food is delicious and very unique. For Arizona, this place is a GEM. Everyone I take here loves it. There are 3 different locations now and they're all kinda special. All three can accomodate big crowds and the desserts are amazing. The Mesa location is in a great spot - and they stay open later than most places in Mesa. Scottsdale has a fantastic indoor/outdoor bar and Tempe is a great informal place to bring a huge group (with parking RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR!). . If you've never tried a pasty - you need to.
Love Cornish! Tasty food (you can't go wrong with meats, veggies, cheese, and bread), great atmosphere, nice staff, and $3 Irish car bombs. All. The. Time. . . There's a ton of tables here, ranging from intimate booths to huge pub style tables (make some new friends!). A huge list of beers on tap, decently priced. They have a patsy for all, vegan even! I love the Italian. Royale with Cheese is also a good fall back. Hell, even their mashed potatoes are bomb. . . Makes for a fun night out. I love going there to pregame, as I mentioned, $3 car bombs. You not only get a good buzz, but also get to eat! Happy hour all day Sunday!
The service here is terrible! I have been to the other location on Dobson prior and was thrilled when I realized this Cornish was right by my home. I decided my friend and I would meet up here for drinks. On this particular night the resturant was packed, like usual. My friend and I saw two open seats at the bar and sat down. About 10 minutes later the waitress told us she would be with us shortly. . . When we hit the 30 minute mark, I was nothing but enraged at the terrible customer service. I told my friend that I wanted to go somewhere else. As I was getting up and gathering my purse, the waitress comes over and had the balls to tell us she was just about to take our order. I informed her that we were leaving because she took 30 minutes to get to us. She should have just let us leave and not say anything. The fact she even acknowledged she was a crappy waitress enraged me more.. . So why the three stars? When you're not waiting FOREVER for service and you actually get the opportunity to eat their pasties, your mind will be blown! The food is delicious! The only downside is you don't want to show up at ANY Cornish starving because it takes them a little while to cook them bad boys. I assure you that you won't regret the wait though!
I've eaten here more times that I can remember. I celebrate birthdays here because my favorite meal on the planet- meat and cheese pasty, red wine gravy, Strongbow pint- comes from this place. There aren't enough positive adjectives in the English language to express how much I love this place. The food quality is always consistently great. The atmosphere (in the original part of the restaurant) reminds me of being in London. It can get a little noisy in the newer part of the restaurant but the food more than makes up for it. I've sampled almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.
Really sexy, warm and fun environment; it's hard not to notice right away. The food is amazing, I had the bacon wrapped meatballs as an appetizer, holy cow amazing! The croutons at the bottom of the bowl was just extra amazing-ness! I had the royale which is basically a cheese burger version and it was unbelievably tasty. The beef is so flavorful (based on the similar taste both the meatballs and royale had) you probably can't go wrong with any of the beef dishes.
