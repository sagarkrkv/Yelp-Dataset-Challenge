A+ !!! We wanted to try a new AYCE place... And so Goyemon was the winner! . . I could've not been more pleased with everything ! . . Assuming that the fiance ordered nigiri items twice, or maybe even three times, that fish itself is of top quality! He kept repeating on how good the fresh scallops were and that they put the right amount of rice!. . I, on the other hand, enjoyed their pork belly! Best pork belly I've ever had! The mango salsa definitely paired off well with the pork.. I had to order it twice! . . Their specialty rolls were good also!. We tried the Crispy Rice, Taylor and Hurricane!. . Make sure to end the night with their Green Tea Creme Brulee !!. . Sooo good!!!
just got home from a long drive(30 mins) with a full stomach. I'm so glad we decided to eat sushi this late and try out goyemon. It's seriously one of my best AYCE experiences. service was friendly and attentive without being bothersome. ok let's talk food..we started off w/ 2 special rolls, salmon skin hand roll and pork belly. everything was good but that pork belly needs more than just good praises. literally, bites of congealed fatty meat heaven. ugh so good! I love how they do nigiri here and this is how they won me over because this is all I eat. they had specials which were bonito, blue fin, salmon belly and I also frequently ordered fresh scallop, uni, ikura/quail, mackerel, and white tuna. all tasted fresh and the rice2fish proportions were perfect! seriously PERFECT! Lol. I feel bad for all the other sushi places I go to because goyemon is my new sushi gf and she is o so delicious.
I had the cucumber salad with shrimp which was very tasty. I also enjoyed the miso soup. I tried the teriyaki chicken roll which was okay, kind of dry actually. I enjoyed the Taylor roll. They do have great lunch specials and all you can eat. Service was alright.
I WOULD NOT EVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE!! I'm sorry to say but my fellow Yelpster's were wrong, this place was a joke.  The fact that our waitress only came to our table once to get our drink order and never came back. Had to wave down another waitress to get our food ordered. Once we got our appetizers it was bland n cold, their Nigiri's dry, the rolls were off tasting as if they over cooked the eel sauce & the baked rolls just awful had to return them because it was burnt.  Who serves anything burnt?? Didn't have an appetite for anything they had after that. It was honestly a waste of time & money. Had to eat somewhere else.
Grade A place off the strip off Vegas for an all you can eat sushi. Make sure you come hungry and able to eat it all, or be charged for it. Make sure you make reservations cause if not you may be waiting quite a minute because when I was sitting an hour flew by so fast, where did the time go. From raw salmon to rolls, everything was amazing and fresh tasting. When stopping here, make sure you keep a track cause you may lose track and it'll keep coming more and more and you may get more than you can handle unless you got friends to help you. The place looks a bit small with the tables and the setup but it's the right size to make sure everyone gets taking care off and gets the food as soon as it can to you and your party :) . . If you go time visiting or a local, stop by and see for yourself. (Picture below)
I really wanted to like this place. But after having lunch there, I couldn't give them more than 3 stars.. . When you find a red spoon with miso-soup, that's a very strong, bad sign. No wonder, the bento box came with multiple items that are only offered at non-authentic Japanese restaurants. It looks like they decided to optimize their business to go the fake-but-catchy sushi bar route... Yeah, I can't blame them for pursuing lucrative clientele. It's business. Just that the restaurant is not for me.
First impression. Rude service. Waitress took order across table. Waitress also did not take responsibility for order. Said she didn't know since someone else took order. Waitress name Geo. Fish was stringy. Only good thing about this place is price...but then again, I guess you get what you pay for...definitely will not return.
Best AYCE sushi place in Vegas at a reasonable price (~$30 dinner) and comes with AYCE dessert. Dessert is always changing but great every time I've tried something new. Service however is never that great every time I've been, but not HORRIBLE. Sit at the bar if possible. . . Nigiri is at the best size with minimal rice, which is good. Try the Ecstacy roll. . . ALL. YOU. CAN. EAT. GREEN TEA TEMPURA ICE CREAM!! . -small orders so you can eat one for yourself :)
I was just finished my review as we were eating but then. While we were eating our desert they already took our payment and as soon as that happened the service went down hill. No one was paying attention to us anymore we tried to order more because we we were not done eating yet but no one was really paying attention to us. It took them another 20 min just to bring out Green tea ice cream. Which in reality how long does it really take to get the green tea ice cream  unless they actually make it themselves. But the other deserts came out in less than a min. They are normally pretty good but this time I was a little embarrassed because we brought our friends telling them that it was a pretty good place. :(
Im offering3 stars because the roll combinations and the fish quality were marginal but the service at the bar sucked. Having sushi should be an experience with your sushi chef and staff. It was not at all. The chefs seemed put out when we placed orders. No engagement at all. Seem awkward. Also, we had dishes piling up a few times and it wasn't busy either.
A very popular AYCE place, in a centralized location in town. Owned by the name owner as Sushi Mon and Monta. But in comparison to Sushi Mon, much classier and nicer setting. . . If you check out the menu, and if you've been to Sushi Mon, you'll recognize how a LOT of the menu is the same as the Sushi Mon menu. . . This place is great for nigiri and roll lovers. They have a wide variety of normal nigiri as well as daily specials that they post on Facebook as well as the chalkboard inside their restaurant. They periodically even have toro (limit 1 order per person), and sometimes salmon belly (mmmm fatty !) . . For a wide ranged of sushi eaters, this is the place to go. If any of my friends are in town, and they crave for sushi, this is where i bring them. . . Appetizers - check out their place mats for their specials (grilled pork belly, seared yellow tail, sashimi salad). Pretty good if you are interested in those things. Grilled pork belly is good but gets boring fast (really fatty xD). Seared yellow tail isnt bad. i think it has a yuzu sauce but they kind of overcook the fish so its a little firm. The sashimi salad is not bad. Decent amount of various chopped fish (salmon, tuna, etc). Nice way to start off the meal ! Not too much of an appetizer person but their mussels are pretty good as well. . . Nigiri -  their salmon and yellowtail are usually pretty spot on. Their amaebi (sweet shrimp) is usually pretty good, and this place will give you the head (deep fried) upon request with order. Uni (sea urchin) is a hit and miss (like all other places). . . Always check out their special menu. They sometimes have some rarer fishes on there as well (amberjack, etc) as well as some more peculiar styles like jalapeno masago, etc. . . Rolls - they have a super wide range of rolls. Traditional maki rolls, to the popular rainbow, spider, or dragon rolls, to the less traditional but very popular mahalo roll (essentially a spam musubi roll), etc. 1/2 rolls are offers for some (not all) rolls. . . Dessert - this is one of the FEW places that include dessert in the AYCE. More than that, its unlimited. They used to have a wide variety of desserts (green tea cake, green tea creme brulee, etc) but now, they have only ice creams, mochi ice creams, and tempura ice cream. still pretty good ! . . Overall, great place to go.. Be aware of the time you go. They do get VERY busy and wait times can get ridiculously long (1-2 hours) so if you dont wanna wait, go earlier =] But, they are also open late too ! So you can also wait till after the dinner rush.
This place is AMAZING. Not only the best all you can eat sushi place I have ever been to but the best sushi I have ever had..and I have eaten a lot of sushi. All you can eat delicious appetizers, succulent sushi and heavenly dessert. Everything is so fresh and the vibe is really great as well. I always make sure to stop there on every trip to Vegas!
The hostess doesn't know how to seat people here.  I came here before when they were pretty busy and the only two seats available wereat the bar but not together.  I thought, ok I'll just ask this nice looking person to slide down a seat so I could sit with my husband.  Apparently this is a huge no-no.  The hostess intervened and said that they can't ask anyone to move.  Whatever, we left.  So I came back today with a large group.  Tons of open tables but none together.  You would think since they don't take reservations they would seat their customers appropriately to prepare for a group of five or more (not too uncommon right?). They should really take reservations and seat their customers in a systematic way.
Hands down, seriously the BEST AYCE sushi spot in all of Vegas!  Yes, the line can be long and painful, but trust me, it's worth it!  Sashimi, nigiri, robata, and sushi rolls all made to order w/ a great selection of apps and salad to choose from as well.  Food is tasty and the fishes are always the color it should be, they do not serve you stuff that has been sitting out for days.  There is a limit on certain more expensive nigiri items (uni, fresh scallop, amaebi) each person is allowed, but with the great selections Goyemon offers, you will hardly notice the limitation.  Even if you're not a sushi lover, there's still plenty of cooked food options you can choose from so definitely do not be discouraged by this place.  Miso black cod and pork belly are 2 dishes worth trying, along with all their yummy grilled vegetables.  Come after 11pm and you can even indulge in their AYCE ramen from their sister restaurant, Monta.  . . Be sure to save room for dessert though as they have a great selection to choose from!  They usually rotate their offerings by season, but their green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, and mochi ice cream are almost always available year round.    . . Service can be hit or miss, but put yourname down and have them call you when your table is ready.  If you are renting a car, it's best that you drive here, write down your name, and venture to the other strip malls near by.  If not, taking a cab from the strip is still worth it.  Just be sure you don't come here when you are already starving and hangry, come w/ a light stomach and be prepared to wait at least 30 mins.. . Happy eating!
The food is not bad.  However, their service is super slow and they have time limit for AYCE.  The servers don't come back even if you are done with your plate.  You have to grab their attentions.  And I agree with someone said the chef is kinda rude too.  My friend and I wanted to sushi bar and it was wide open but the chef got angry with us because we didn't sit right next to the customers he already had at the sushi bar.  I would understand it if it was busy but no.  There are so many AYCE places in Las Vegas and I have no doubt that there are better sushi places out there.
This WAS my favorite AYCE place which I had been visiting for the last two years, until my last visit where I had the worst customer service experience EVER.. . My boyfriend and I are well aware of the policy for uni and sweet shrimp (one order per person), which was what we ordered but the chefs gave us a really hard time about it and would only serve us one order. Not only that but they were hispanic chefs and immediately started bad mouthing us in spanish..... unfortunately I speak spanish as well however I'm light skinned enough to pass off as a white girl..... so I understood everything. SO for any of you who are wondering what the chef is saying while they're staring at you while you're seated in front of them at the bar, don't think they're saying sweet things about you. . . After we did not receive the order, the chefs continued to ignore us while we sat there in front of them. They continued talking and giggling while taking glances at us. The servers eventually came around to fill our drinks as we had nothing left and the server (also hispanic) asked the chef what was wrong or why we looked annoyed. The chef later replied in spanish that it was because we wanted "more food" so I interrupted and in spanish spoke out to them. OF course the chefs at that point turned bright red since they were unaware that I spoke spanish and was listening to them the entire time. Needless to say I was furious. . . I'm still baffled that someone can talk all this messed up stuff while you sit in front of them. . . Thanks to this I will never return.
I was getting cabin fever at the Mandalay Bay!  Yelp... Take me away.  I saw a picture posted by Mona W that looked so good I decided to give this place a try. . AYCE sushi?!?!  WTF?!?!  Nasty... Right?. Not here. Not at all. Lin was my sushi chef and he was great. (We were both very quiet, but that's okay since it was pretty crazy all around the place). . $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. Not bad. It's not Sushi Sushi by any means, but it's pretty good. (Don't want to tarnish my credibility but it was okay. Not great. Sushi should be great, otherwise don't eat it. Just saying).
IS THIS PLACE FOR REEEEEEAAAAAAAAALLLLLL?!?!??!?!?!?!?. . They have a SPECIAL MENU of the DAY?  They have dessert lineup specials as well as usual dessert?!?!?  THey have CURRY?   They have UDON?  WHAT?!. . HANDS DOWN, the best AYCE place EVER. And even comparing this place to a regular sushi spot, it can RIVAL FOR SURE!  . . OMG when I had the GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE, I thought I saw the gates of heaven opening up and the light beam coming at me, like I was on my way to some magical place. I saw THE LIGHT. OR something, like that. You get my drift. . . Yellowtail was good.  I went all-in on sushi nigiri style, and didn't even touch the rolls. That's how you do it right fellas, when you hit up an AYCE spot. Limit that rice and unnecessary carb and veggie fill up. Stick with the raw fish stuff. . . Price can't be beat. I will be coming back here every time I want sushi. Forget about those normal spots when you got GOYEMON.  BRAVO !!!!!!!
Protip: remember that Sushimon on Sahara and Goyemon both use the same punch card! Make sure to get those stamps!. . My go-to AYCE sushi place! Is it the best? Well, that's subjective. If you're looking for a solid AYCE for the quality and price, this is it. Disclaimer: Keep in mind that all-you-can-eat quality sushi cannot compare to the super fresh level of excellence of SOME, real, authentic sushi places. I wouldn't compare this Kabuto or other ala carte, higher-quality joints. This is strictly based in comparison to other AYCE places.. . AMBIANCE: Decor is clean, intimate, but without the creepy silent vibes or weird football jerseys on the wall. Low mood lighting, laid-back, and doesn't feel too casual. You don't need to be too dressy either.. . SEATING: Try getting a seat at the bar! Intimidated on how to order? Make eye contact with the sushi chef facing you even he looks busy, then say what you'd like! . . Service is definitely hit-or-miss once in a while. This place is popular on the weekends especially during dinnertime. Last time I was here, it was still quite busy on a weekday dinner rush hour. Always expect a wait! A party of 5+ can be very difficult to seat! I believe they don't take reservations over the phone, but I heard this changed according to some other diners. If you're just dining with one other person, it's a lot quicker, especially if you say you don't care if you're seated at a table or the bar.. . FOOD: I've been here countless times (enough to fill 5 of their stamps cards and a few paycheck's worth!), and the fish has always tasted fresh, crisp. Fish portion is generous. They don't try to load you up on rice unless you're ordering mostly rolls. Love the questionable super white tuna. The ubiquitous, americanized rolls are usually on-point, large, and presented beautifully. My fave is the moon roll!. . Try ordering half-orders in case you end up disliking a particular roll. This way, you can sample many types of rolls. Too often do I see the people next to me saying they are not eating their rolls because they had too much of it or didn't prefer it. They end up not knowing you can order half! Ex: say "half dragon" or "half" whatever.. . It varies on who your chef is when it comes to execution. A few times, my roll or nigiri has come out looking like a beauty school drop-out :C sometimes, consistency is an issue when it comes to presentation.. . VERDICT: Although Goyemon is hyped up, it's really because they try to bring better quality fish to the masses of the AYCE crowd. Service can suffer when it's packed. Last time I was here, our server totally forgot about us sitting in the corner of the bar! When he saw my drink was completely empty, he tried to make it up to us by diligently coming back and checking on us since then.. . Fun for a date-night spot or a small get-together. A solid experience and hands-down one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots.
