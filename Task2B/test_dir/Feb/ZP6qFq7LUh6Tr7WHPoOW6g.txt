Hands down the best breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas.. . We drive 35 mins to have breakfast at this location.  The owner/chef has tremendous food pride in her menu and establishment.  She has an amazing sense of savory and texture and of course chooses to serve up high quality ingredients to her patrons..  . Whether you order Shirmp and Grits, Benedict or just plain old eggs, you will be served up the most delicious morning experience of  'wonderfulness'.. . The atmosphere has an urban/rustic feel to it with a splash vintage elegance.  My only complaint is that  EAT is not open for dinner -- serving breakfast.  lol.. . Parking is off street, easy and convenient. It isn't uncommon to see the proprietor enjoying fresh air seated on the bench in front of this gem of a restaurant.
My new favorite breakfast restaurant of all time! Everything tasted amazing and was well priced. Two complaints:. 1. My stomach wasn't big enough. 2. It's going to be a LONG drive from CA when I crave their food . . Do yourself and your taste buds a favor and go "eat." here! See what I did there?!
As good as you've heard.  Bloody noisy though.
Brekkie has never been so savory!  I wanted the beignets and they were out so we had some yummy shortbread and berry dish instead....great way to start a meal though.  I really did like the concept, layout/design, and menu offerings here.  The owner takes pride in all aspects of the establishment and is very diligent about walking about and standing over operations (sometimes reminding staff about what they should be doing).   . . The service was pretty good...we were well tended to and never really needed anything.  From what I gathered it seems like they are still working out an effective plan for better logistical coordination of guests when it gets crowded; but that did not affect us as we arrived right before the lunch crowd.. . The food was delicious - it is not your typical breakfast and lunch fare - this place offers you up gourmet offerings in unique and creative ways which will have you wishing you were more hungry; so you could try out more than just one entree.  Believe me; you need to be famished when you go because you will not want to stop eating.  Hence the title - eat.. . I really enjoyed it and when back in Vegas; will most definitely try to get back over to this part of town for such great food.
Swanky breakfast/lunch place downtown. I would say brunchHOWEVER we all know the quintessential brunch item is a mimosa... They don't have this.. . So! The PIC & I ventured through the urban jungle that is DTLV & walked in. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated. Browsed through the menu, and got the cinnamon strawberry biscuits. WOW order these, you will not be disappointed. . . For the main entrees we got the truffled egg sandwich. Yum, really good & the chive potatoes that accompany their breakfast dishes are on point. The grilled cheese with tomato bisque is delish as well. . . Why not 5 stars? Service can be improved just a bit & some of their more popular items (the chicken fried steak) should be available all day. Nonetheless, I will be back.
This popular, new DT nook reminds me of a trendy NYC brunch hangout. It's not so much the food or the decor that causes me to reminisce, it's the fact that this place has limited seating, excess patrons, and folks will wait a long time for a table even though there are other good restaurants within walking distance.. . If you're dining alone, you can plant yourself at the counter almost immediately. If you're with a group. The wait can be as long as 45 mins, and unlike Hash-House-a-Go-Go, which also always has a long wait, they don't have a pager to give you and you can't just sashay up to the bar while you wait for a table.. . I will tell you, these guys really care about their customers.  When I received my Downtown Benedict (one of their signature dishes) I found that the poached eggs were hard boiled.  I didn't even complain, but the manager noticed a look of disappoint on my face and rushed in and had the dish re-fired.. . The Benedict was not bad. I picked up a slightly off-putting vinegar flavor from it.  There was probably too much vinegar in the poaching liquor.  The side of skillet-grilled potatoes was pretty good (fresh not frozen). Hollandaise sauce had a smooth, creamy texture. All ingredients tasted fresh, and the plating and presentation was, as I like to say, "pretty." . . I would recommend Eat. It may not blow you away, but it's a decent breakfast haven.  Just be aware of the wait and the noise.
Fantastic!!!!  Very friendly staff and the food was insane.  The pancakes are easily the best I have ever had in Vegas.  They have a guitar up front that you can jam on also which was cool!!! Awesome breakfast!
Pleasant fare at a fair price. I ate lunch here twice in three days if that's any indicator. It's a short walk on a nice day from old Vegas. #1 was the BLT with avocado and chicken-chili soup. Lunch #2 was a simple breakfast. The bacon in both instances  was memorable but everything, including the service, was consistently good. None of my dining companions had anything negative to say about their meals either.
Waited for over an hour and a half then finally  told the chef was no longer seating anyone!  Boo!
Terrible. Waited over an hour and service was extremely bad. Not worth the wait. Go to MTO!!!
This is our new favorite breakfast place. Try the biscuits and warm strawberry compote, so good!  The staff are very friendly and helpful and the service is fast.
Found eat through Yelp and headed there on a Sunday morning. It's in downtown at the corner of 7th and Carson, right across from the relatively new Container Store Park. There is plenty of 2-hour street parking which is free on Sunday. At 10 am, there were a handful of people waiting, so we put our name down for a 20-minute wait. It took a little longer than that, but the staff was very nice and thanked us profusely for waiting and being patient. . . The place has a modern feel to it, you would almost think you were Santa Monica as opposed to being about 10 minutes from the Strip. We were seated at a table for two at the end of the counter high table in the middle. The tables were all far apart enough from each other where you didn't feel overcrowded. . . I ordered the eggs benedict and K had the corned beef. I loved mine because the turkey bacon it came with what super extra crispy just the way I like. There was a little too much hollandaise sauce for me but for those who like a lot, then you'll love this! My potatoes were booked perfectly with the right amount of crisp (to me they are the perfectors of a nice crisp!) and the portion was plenty filling for $13. K liked his corned beef but it wasn't the traditional kind you might think of, this one had real pieces of meat. And it came with four pieces of super thick delicious Texas toast. . . It was a great breakfast especially if you're planning on hanging around in the downtown area. We went across the street to check out the container park and walk off breakfast.
Ate here once about a month ago. I thought the food was great so I decided to return for lunch with friends. Arrived and the wait was 1 hour. That's fine no problem. Waited 1.5 hours then the hostess told me the chef said not to seat us. Don't you think they should have told us that before we waited over an hour. This place is very popular but it won't be for long if they do this to people.
Delicious food, great service, and Chef Natalie was there managing the front of the house. I was disappointed that the 2 things I wanted to order were not on the menu that day (the beignets and the truffled egg sandwich). I had the downtown benedict which was delicious and the side of potatoes were actually crispy not soggy! My husband had scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. The sourdough toast was thick cut, buttery and delicious. My son got the pancakes which by far out shined everything. The pancakes were the best I've ever had, and I am not a pancake person. I have not had pancakes in years. I prefer waffles because I like a crunchy outside with a tender middle and pancakes are usually just soggy sponges. But these pancakes were absolutely amazing. They were crispy on the edges and so fluffy in the middle. The flavor was perfect - buttery and light, just needed a dab of maple syrup. I could not stop taking bites from my son's plate. Luckily, he could only eat 2, so I could eat as much of the 3rd one as I wanted to. This dish has made me rediscover pancakes!. . We also had the strawberry cinnamon sugar biscuits. The biscuits were nice and tender but the strawberry sauce which was poured all over everything was too sweet and overpowered everything. I would have preferred a side of the strawberry sauce to dip the biscuits instead of it being dumped all over.. . For a small place, it gets quite loud. It gets crowded too so expect a wait. The wait is worth it though, especially for those pancakes!
I was slightly disappointed. . EVERYONE and their moms have been raving about this place via all sorts of social media channels. . . The concept is wonderful. I love the location, decor, the art. I REALLY want to fall in love with this spot. . . I had Sunday Brunch here. The wait was long... but I was ready for it. After all only the best food attract the longest lines. I have high hopes when we finally get seated. . . The menu was uniquely standard - your basic breakfast items with their own flavor. But the moment of truth when my order Downtown Eggs Benedict was about to approach my mouth.... ehh. . I wasn't blown away by the taste - I didn't grin in happiness with how tasty my food was. It was just alright. . . I will try again in hopes that I just had a rough day.
So I'm gonna be super cliche and give this place 5 stars. Well deserved of course! Arriving early is a must. We went right before 11am the Monday after SuperBowl and boy did that place fill up quick in the next 10 minutes. We were seated immediately but if we came any later, we would have been waiting for 45 minutes. . . I ordered the truffled egg sandwich and my buddy had the huevo motulenos, both of which were excellent. Perfect hangover food.
So other than this being one if the most expensive bfasts I've ever had, it was good, but not worth all the hype imho.. . The staff was great, courteous, and attentive and other than me getting chives on my sandwich after asking for none, I had no issue.. . I was disappointed that they have a somewhat limited bfast menu during the week (no eggs benedict) and they discontinued the beignets, which were the two things I specifically came for, thus the docked star.. . The coffee was good and they have Truvia which is a def plus. I got the truffled egg sandwich, which was surprisingly bland for $12 and could have used some cheese or something for flavor. I made my own concoction of syrup and tabasco, which I know sounds completely weird, but is absolutely delicious! The chive potatoes were also a little too much on the greasy side for my liking.. . The stars of the morning bfast show were the cinnamon butter strawberry compote biscuits, which were amazing if not pricey @$8 for four. Maybe it was the fresh blackberries? . . In any case, I don't know that I'd go back as you have to pay for street parking and it is in kind of a shady sectionof DT. But, I did enjoy what I did experience for the pretty penny it cost.
I can't say enough good things about this place! I went in on my own one morning. I chose to sit by the window cause I wasn't sure if my back would allow me to sit on a bar stool. Even though I really wanted to watch the action I ended up enjoying my view of downtown.. . First of all Eat has the friendliest staff! From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out the door everyone was helpful and really nice. The service was spot on. They never let my tasty cup of coffee get empty and even brought me more cream.. . It was hard to pick what I wanted from their menu because everything sounded so good! I decided on the corn beef hash. I was glad I did!! It came with chunks of meat and potatoes perfectly cooked with green onions. On top was the best looking two poached eggs I've ever seen! I broke them open and let all the yummy yellow yolkie goodness melt over my hash. It also came with some tasty toast that I could not resist eating one piece of. Definitely was an excellent meal to start the day.. . Eat is a little pricey, but for the quality, taste and service it's more then worth it! I'll be back again to try something off their lunch menu! Yay for Eat!
This is hands down the best place I've been too ever!!! Love the diversity, the atmosphere and the food was delicious. Definitely my new favorite place
I have been here for lunch twice now. It's a smaller restaurant which makes you very in tune with the atmosphere.  The service I have gotten has been prompt and very approachable. The food comes out fast, and you can definitely see that they care about what they are serving here. I've had the Reuben, thick toast, not soggy with dressing, it was hands down one of the best reubens I have had the pleasure of eating.  . . I cannot recommend this place enough. Oh, and try the cinnamon biscuits with the fruit, your taste buds willthank you.
Compliments to the friendly staff. Best breakfast spot off the strip. Less than 10 min away. Street parking. . Went here three days in a row and had pancakes every time.. Even their coffee is kick a$$. . Ate:. Strawberry compote - flaky biscuit, fresh fruit. Pancakes - fluffy inside, nice bite outside. Shrimp and Grits - hearty.. Grilled cheese and tomato soup - cheesy and crunchy, not too creamy soup just with the right tang.. Chicken fried steak - very crunchy!
I hated this place pretty much from the very beginning. It was very busy and not enough staff, apparently. It's a room with nothing on the walls or floors to absorb the sound so it's very loud. After we were seated it took nearly 5 minutes for the server just to get to the table. . . The menu is limited in that they are all about that meat and potatoes thing with very few alternative options: no meatless, vegetarian, or gluten free items. . . I opted for a bowl of steel cut oats topped with strawberries & pecans and it was ok. Certainly nothing special about a bowl of oatmeal so I'm not even sure what I expected here. No PB and most have never heard of putting it in your oatmeal. But if you don't, all you get is a bowl of carbs for breakfast. . Do they even know what bill time is? In all the time I've been eating out I have never had any restaurant not give me a credit card receipt. It is not your position to assume I don't want one and I should never have to ask for it. Always get a credit card receipt to help prevent fraud. . . Not going back here. The end.
Everything I've ever had at Eat has been delicious. That being said, the pancakes are my very favorite. They aren't fruity candy filled treats.  Instead, they are plain buttermilk serviced with butter and actual maple syrup. Despite having an extreme sweet tooth, these pancakes are THE VERY BEST I've ever had - a little buttery and crisp on the outside (just enough), and fluffy deliciousness on the inside. I realize this review has turned into an ode to pancakes, but they deserve it! . . If I'm being at all critical, I must point out that there is almost always a wait to eat at Eat. However, it is run well and you can tell this is usually based upon demand and not poor management. . . In sum, I'm a local and enjoy Eat every time I go. Highly recommended!!! . . (The grilled cheese with tomato soup is also quite epic - great lunch choice; the veggie chili is hearty and flavorful, both healthy and filling, but probably not for those meat eaters who will likely miss the meat - I loved it, but am a vegi so take that as you will)
I woke up hungry with a sudden craving for beignets. Realizing I was in Vegas and not NOLA I want expecting to find anything but I stumbled upon Eat in downtown. . . We were seated quickly during a holiday weekend. I like the decor with the modern lights and the greenery inside. There was a lot of personality like a typewriter in the waiting space and a wall that says, "I'll see you in the flowers." I appreciate the open kitchen layout. . . We shared the biscuits which came slathered in very sauce and topped with a generous portion of whole fruit: strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. We also ordered the corn beef hash. Surprisingly flavorful, it came with two perfectly poached eggs and four pieces of sourdough. The two dishes were the perfect pairing of savory and sweet. . . My only qualm: Drinks are a little pricey. $3 for coffee & $3 for an Arnold Palmer? I'm used to only paying a dollar or two for drinks, especially coffee.  The coffee here wasn't anything special but my fiance pointed out there were free refills on both drinks. . . I was happy with the service. One of the waiters (who wasn't even our waiter) came over and told me he was worried about someone stealing my camera. I appreciate the gesture & I'd totally return to give business to kind-hearted people.
I don't know why this place is rated so high. That was what brought me here in the first place. The food was forgettable, "room" overcrowed, wait was long. I imagined that I would enjoy this place more if I had recently rolled out of bed with a bad hangover. The lighting dark- again, I think the target market for this restuarant is those with terrible hangovers or frequent migranes.
All eat. does is breakfast and lunch...and they do it well. I've visited several times and never had a bad meal. Favorites include the Shrimp and Grits for breakfast and the BLT with Avocado, served with house-made potato chips. The grilled cheese with tomato soup is perfect comfort food and incredible if you step up and add some of their smoky thick bacon. . . The menu changes seasonally with items rotating in and out. Plenty of vegetarian options for those so inclined. And brewed ice tea.. . The clientele is eclectic trending to hipster. Parking can be tricky downtown and be prepared to feed a meter. And expect a wait if you're trying for a weekend mid-morning breakfast. Totally worth it.
We have been meaning to try EAT since it opened and we are so glad we did. The service was great and the food was excellent. We will most definitely be going back to try some of the other options.
The only thing that ruined our experience at 'eat' was the view from my seat of some big guy showing off his hairy ass crack. Along with that view, was a not-so-attractive woman at a different  table showing off her crack too. Despite the horrid visuals around me (and slightly throwing up in my mouth as I saw the dude's ass) the food was great. The BLT was as good as you'll find and the same can be said about the pancakes. With slightly crispy edges and a fluffy texture, it can easily be billed as one of the better pancakes in town. Syrup is available, but isn't needed. The chicken apple sausage on top was great, as well. It wasn't a cheap breakfast, but the quality is well worth it. The brunch menu on weekends is fairly small, much more so than the usual breakfast or lunch menu on weekdays. So, plan your visit accordingly.
As someone who's lived in NYC an la and in Vegas for just a year, I love this place. It's got a cute, casual, hipster vibe with great breakfast food!  I literally crave the cinnamon biscuits and strawberries and will venture here just for them! The service is friendly and quick. It makes me forget I'm in a chain filled city and pretend that I'm in downtown la :). So glad they're here!  (Great vegetarian options too!)
I bet this place used to rock. Now they bring you cold (and I mean COLD out of the refrigerator) hollandaise and say that they can't heat it up much more because it will break. Service is weak at best. Our food took 45 minutes to come out after a almost two hour wait for a table. Nothing was to die for. They only offer a limited menu on the weekends which makes no sense. We had looked up the menu on line and only about half of the items were available on a Sunday. Bummer
Here's the deal: I want this place to do well. I thought it was in the plus side of mediocre but I saw so much potential in it. And I LOVE Las Vegas is starting to offer unique, local, off-Strip places like this that try hard and do a good job. . . I had the chilaquiles and they weren't spectacular, but they were good.  My friend's daughter's biscuits looked fantastic with the strawberry jam on top, but I wish there was more fruit and less jam.  Service was very attentive and sweet.  I liked the place a lot, I just wish the food were a little bit better.
Oh my gosh I love this restaurant!!!!! The atmosphere, the service, THE FOOD!!!! Ah man. I eat here twice a week and try something new every time. I highly recommend!!!
Came here from LA because I saw a post on the Downtown Project instagram page... (I was in Vegas for other reasons) but it was just as delicious as expected! I have no reason to give it nothing but a 5 except for the reason that there was one bathroom stall, except one of the employees encouraged me to use the men's. I was all for it so I did! Living life on the edge... Anyways. Ordered the truffle egg sandwich,.. was blown away. I'm always nervous to order anything egg in the first place but when you add the word truffle, the game changes. It was delicious! Service? Great! Their to go cups are so cute too. Great experience overall, super cute stop in the middle of ever changing downtown Las Vegas. Highly recommend!. . Ps. Eggs Benedict only on the weekends ;(
Decided to grab some breakfast on Saturday morning, saw eat. On yelp decided to try it. Waited about 30 minutes but it was well worth the wait. Walked In and sat at the bar area, service was so fast and friendly feels like your family when your there. I ordered the eggs Benedict, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak. We got to see the preparation, because we had seats facing the kitchen. The food was amazing and you get a lot of food for your money. Everything was so fresh and tasted amazing definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu. A must go if you are in the downtown area.
So I had to get breakfast and lunch menu. By the time I ate it was brunch so it was good reason. I was really hoping it was amazing or worth the drive. It was good but not amazing. Place was trendy, very new scene downtown chic. . . I'll give it second try and try more items. I can't nor want to judge this place by the 3 items I tried. For now I give it a 2. For now.
Got there, was told it would be a 35 minute wait. Ended up standing there for almost an hour as they seated people who had arrived after us. Ended up walking away, to bad the food sounded good. Would give less stars if I could.
Found this place easily and parked for free one block down. Walk in and leave my name as there was a wait.  She informed me 10min.  We got sat within that time a nice corner cushioned booth.  The house was full. Cement brick walls. Reminds me of a place I've had brunch in San Francisco.  Fabric napkins.  Condiment plate is the centerpiece with assortment of sweeteners.  The menu is presented on a clipboard. I had the passion fruit iced tea.  It was unsweetened tasted freshly brewed and refreshing. Read the reviews here and ordered the common suggested shrimp and grits as well as killer grilled cheese.  The server warned us they are known for food to arrive right away and there might be a bit of delay.  Service was on point, everything arrived in a timely manner. They were plated nicely.  The grits were topped with shrimp hidden underneath a pico de gallo like salsa.  It was good but maybe not my taste to crave again. The grilled cheese looked great made with thick toast. The tomato soup we asked to have with it was thick. The menu lists tomato salad.  Just the right amount of cheese!  Like this one!  Our bill came out to $32 for two drinks and two plates. It was a cute place to catch up with my girlfriend.
'Eat' is on the top of my list of places to, well, eat when I come to town. The menu is great and the quality of food is exceptional. The service, ambiance, and experience are also top-notch. Always ask about their specials! They're always amazing.
The truffled egg sandwich was a life changing experience.  Few breakfast sandwiches even come close to matching the awesomeness of this one
What a great place to eat after a hard night of Vegas!! . . We had to wait about 20-30 minutes on a Sunday morning, but hey, that sounds about right.  The diner seemed a bit "hipstery" but I didn't mind too much.. . My Cousin and I had the country fried steak and eggs.  I had bacon and he had the apple sausage on the side.  And WOW!!!! This place is seriously delicious. Everything was cooked exactly as ordered, and the service was great  too.  . . The coffee was a bit on the normal side, but at least it wasn't horrible.. . All in all this place deserves a 5 star rating and I will definitely come back if I stay in the area again.
