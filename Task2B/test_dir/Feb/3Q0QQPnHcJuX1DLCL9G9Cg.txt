Nice airport in decent condition. The food and shopping selections have improved over the years. While I find it a tad annoying to have a restroom attendant, I do appreciate a clean seat & sink. Go ahead, tip them, hit the Body Shop & have a drink! You'd be surprised by breakfast selections at 5:30/6:00.
I have never had any troubles going through security at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.  The airport has some nice stores, bars, and restaraunts.  If you are getting picked up from the airport, it can get a little hectic because they try to keep the traffic moving.
This airport now offers free wifi. That's a big plus in an otherwise mediocre airport.
was here for a 2 hours layover.... lots of restaurants and shops to walk around in. Make sure you check out EA SPORTS! They even have a live piano player playing songs to entertain people in the main hall.. My only complaint with this airport is that they do not update the info boards enough. I ALMOST MISSED MY FLIGHT!
I loathe flying - every second that I'm on a plane is sheer torture. I'm currently 28,000 feet in the air and Yelping to avoid thinking about that fact and the two hyperactive 8 year olds who are literally wrestling in the seat behind me. . . Right, so I hate flying, But I do love a good airport. Maybe it's just that I'm so ecstatic to have my feet back on the ground, or maybe it's that airports like Charlotte's instill in me a sense of adventure, even a bit of nostalgia for the days when flying was a bit more romantic. . . Bright and airy, with plenty of moving walkways to help you traverse the terminals rather painlessly, CLT (perhaps in spite of its unfortunate call letters) is spacious and welcoming. The connecting space between terminals is lined with live trees and an abundance of white rocking chairs (and the occasional live piano music). The bathrooms each have an attendant which, granted, was really bizarre the first time I experienced this, but I've become accustomed to their greetings. One of them used to even sing a sort of ongoing gospel wishing everyone a safe flight. That's called character, people, and this airport's got it.. . If there's one downfall it's that the older terminals were clearly not designed for the larger planes. There's almost never enough seating for the passengers waiting to board, and it's almost always overcrowded in these areas. . . Got a long layover? The first good news is you've got access to free WI-FI. And you won't be disappointed by the food and drink options - I have one very fond memory of a long liquid lunch at the Bacardi Rum restaurant (yep -  apparently that's a thing). They just added an Illy coffee shop as well in the newer D terminal for those of you who like your coffee rich and Italian (...like your men? Sorry, I had to go there :)
CLT:. . Without a doubt, Charlotte Douglas International is the best airport in the Carolinas.  It's the biggest airport in North and South Carolina, so it offers the most options when it comes to flights.  This typically means lower airfare, more scheduling flexibility, and a larger number of non-stop flights.  CLT to SFO, FTW.. . Growing up in High Point, our family's "home" airport was naturally Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).  It's a fine airport if you're making a short regional/east coast trip.  However, more often than not, you will have to connect somewhere if your itinerary originates or ends at PTI.  That can be an inconvenience.. . More often these days, if flying into or out of North Carolina and trying to get to the Triad, we'll bypass PTI altogether and instead use CLT (and in some instances, RDU - Raleigh/Durham International Airport).  The less-than-1.5-hour drive from the Triad to CLT is worth the time savings and hassle of having to connect in Chicago, DC, Dallas, Houston, etc.. . Currently, the Charlotte airport is in the midst of major expansion/renovation.  Passenger traffic is growing and the airport is trying to keep up.  While the airport is a hub for US Airways, it still feels relatively small.  No need for people movers.  You can walk in a straight line and cover all the terminals in a short amount of time.  This is good and bad - no need to navigate/walk long distances, but when it's packed, it's packed (not a whole lot of space).  There are multiple security checkpoints and you can easily go from one to another to find shorter lines.. . The airport has many years on it, but it's well maintained and feels comparatively modern and clean.  One of the best things about Charlotte's airport are the inexpensive parking fees.  Unfortunately, parking fees will be increasing soon, but will remain at reasonable levels.  Long-term lots will increase to $7 a day from $5 a day and daily parking will increase to $10 a day from $7 a day.  The hourly deck and valet prices are set to increase too.  All parking at CLT requires shuttle access to the terminals.. . Overall, Charlotte Douglas is a solid airport for the Carolinas.
The airport is fine but the bathroom attendants have GOT TO GO! especially when they keep talking while you're trying to use the facilities...not okay.
Worst airport in the area. Never come to CLT on Monday morning. The valet parking was full by 6:10 am. Security lines are ridiculous. I drove up from Columbia SC for the last time.
I think this is one of the best airports in the world, but the new gate check in changes are ridiculous.  They seem to change weekly and they have ruined any benefits of having status or first class.  Jamming all business travelers through a single gate just destroys the purpose.  Charlotte has too many flyers with status with USAir.  You would think airport management would realize this.
My boys love going to the airport lookout. There are a few benches and picnic tables for a snack. Trees for shade also. It of course is loud, but great view.
It's a big and busy airport with a lot of flights, so it's just logical that it has a lot of food everywhere, lots to choose from (having in mind it is an airport), some good, some not so much, for a quick snack or to dine in; a lot of people on the run and so it has a fair amount of annoying people and also so many friendly service faces if you have the right attitude.. This was my forth time in this airport and I have no complaints for it.
Great airport. Air travel is rarely a pleasant experience, but if you have to fly through anywhere, CLT is a good place to kill time during a layover.. . The amenities here, first off, are great. The wi-fi is free, fast, and maintains a good connection throughout the airport. The main concourse is also the most picturesque scene from any airport I've visited - it's essentially been modeled as a classic Southern city downtown scene, with a walkway lined by trees, rocking chairs, and retailers, with lots of ambient light, to boot. The food options at CLT are also very good, and it helps to have a Starbucks in each concourse. . . The only down-side about CLT is that, since it's all one large terminal, you have to do a lot of walking if you're coming off a flight in one concourse and headed to a connection in another. If you're really in a hurry though, just flag down airport staff and they'll be happy to give you a lift.. . In short, if you have to be here for a while, it's not at all a bad place to be.
I like the rocking chairs! Bathrooms clean and easy to navigate around the terminals.
I personally thought this place is the front runner of the new concept of the airport.  I have used this place twice for connecting flight, meaning this review doesn't reflect any experience regarding driving to and from the airport, and parking situation.. . I thought the connecting transition was smooth.  Terminals were well connected, so there was little confusion with how to find the right gate.  It also offered free wifi, which is a really rare occasion in the US airport business (If the wifi worked as it was supposed I would have given 5 stars in a heartbeat.  Unfortuately, free wifi didn't work when I stopped by).  It also offered a variety of dining options from fastfood joints, food court type food and even some boutique-quality dining experience.  . . Overall, I can assure you this is one of the airports that you wanna have a break if you have a connecting flight.
One of the few US airports that I have encountered with toilet attendants.  This concept is ok, but the reality of it is that every time you go in one at Charlotte, you have the impression of being accosted by street vendors in a 3rd world country.   I'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips.  They don't put toilet paper in the stalls.  They don't clean urine off the toilet seats.  They only thing I saw them do was tear off a paper towel and hand it to me and then expect a tip.  If you don't leave a tip, then they are rude.  Get real Charlotte, pay your cleaning crew to clean the toilets and get rid of the bogus attendants.  I don't like to be accosted when I need to pee.
Charlotte should be the new standard for modern American airports. LaGuardia, take notice. This is how it's done. (Seriously, LaGuardia...for all of our sake). . I've only used Charlotte for connections, so can't comment on the parking, ticketing, or security lines. I can say, however, that the terminals are clean, nice, and easy to navigate. For food choices, the airport offers a nice mix of local food (at least I assume the barbecue joints are local) and the standard airport staples. There is plenty of variety as well. . . I also feel the need to mention the bathroom attendants which I'm not used to seeing in airport bathrooms. They give the impression that the airport is glad to have you there rather than it being inconvenienced by your presence.  . . I hope to find myself in Charlotte again on future flights. If you're going to be stuck in an airport for a few hours waiting for a connection, this isn't a bad place to do it.
Worst airport ever.. Flight to Jacksonville was schedule for 9:19am.. I'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly 2 hours later. The lady on the overhead has been telling the passengers we will leave in 15-20 minutes. At this point I'm tired of hearing that. Now I know if there was something wrong with the plane then it's understandable but no we have yet to board the aircraft due to the 1st officer not being here on time.. Now if you know there's a flight schedule why wouldn't you make sure the person is her or even better have a back up plan.. Ridiculous planning if you ask me!! All I'm saying is SFO left on time and arrived in Charlotte early.. Now that's a good job well done.. As for my first time in Charlotte.. No never again.. I'll just pay extra for a direct flight
When it comes to airports, for me, Charlotte is definitely at the top of the heap.  It was a nice stop over point on our recent trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico.  US Airways, soon to be American Airlines owns this place.  The airport seems clean, fresh, modern and friendly.  Wide walkways with an atrium, nothing warmer than a curved wall of windows lined with trees and white wooden rockers.  Easy to navigate including lots of moving walkways.  Quirky and cute art displays.  There is even a replica of the original flyer flown by Orville and Wilbur Wright.  Lots of currency exchange booths.  You name it, they've got it.. . Lots of foods choices, my travel friend of Starbucks, and bars galore.  They also have a nice variety of shopping.  This airport also has a crew of 70 airport volunteers to ensure your stop at CLT is a positive experience.. . I hear that they even have a large area for watching taking off and landings complete with a picnic area and park benches.  Or you can just watch from your car.  How friendly is that?  Next time I book a flight, I will try to look for a stopover in Charlotte.
Nice airport. . . Vast in size, not the largest, but not the smallest. I like that the atrium area holds not only foods, bars, coffee shops, but also shopping wares.  Not to be noted, I don't like to shop, but WINDOW SHOPPING as I walk to my gate is not all that bad.  I've noticed a few things that I wouldn't mind pulling a #stickandmove coup.  . . Loving the availability of different food selections... fresh food, fresh sushi, sandwiches, juice bars and the list goes on and on.  As, I'm not quite the "frequent flyer" so to speak, I do travel a little bit & food choices are critical between layovers.  I was really impressed with a Mini-Farmer's Market, located around the E Concourse.  . . Recycling is ALLLLLLWWWWWAYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSS a plus in my book.  There's even a catchy phrase along the lines of 'you toss, it we sort it'; how cool.  I mean part of the confusion with recycling and why I personally feel people don't do it is because they're unsure of what to recycle and where it goes.  But with this 'toss it... sort it' effort, it's a no brainer.. . Pluses:. I do love the Jetson styled moving walkway. Various faith based religious services available on Sunday. Cool rocking chairs strategically placed throughout and along concourse. . Minuses:. I would love to see more charging stations. More adaptable jet bridges, walking on the tarmac is sooooo lame. . All in all, this airport is pretty cool.
Large, but not unruly and un-navigable. . . A fairly modern airport that leads to a central courtyard filled with all sorts of yummy delights and nifty shops. . . I have plunked myself down in a rocking chair a couple of times and the staff is extremely pleasant here. The bathroom attendants   do an excellent job of triage and keeping the facilities clean.  Lots of moving walkways yet still plenty of room for people to walk to and fro on the normal floor. Probably the furthest place north there is a bojangles too.!
I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight, the gate agent said that they know we're coming and not to worry. We ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane. When they came back they said that 15 minutes ago they gave our seats to standby passengers and that the PLANE LEFT 15 MINUTES EARLY! They told us that it is a transfer airport so they usually leave early. BS!  They told us that they only hold the plane if there at least 10 people missing. Luckily there was 1 more flight that night. Suck it U.S Airways
Nice airport, pretty big, and generally clean. They have plenty of moving sidewalks to get to your gate more quickly, which I like.
