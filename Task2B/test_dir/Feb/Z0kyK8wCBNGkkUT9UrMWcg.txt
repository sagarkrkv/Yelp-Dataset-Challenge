From the moment you walk in to the restaurant you feel like a VIP. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. And I have been to quite a few fine restaurants all over the world and I am pleased to report that the service here is among the best. All of our needs are catered to but not in an annoying way. The timing was impeccable the attention to detail was meticulous and professional and the service was a large part of the overall experience. OK on to the food. I ordered the pineapple infused martini. Again ,outstanding..a subtle taste of vodka and a lovely aroma and taste of pineapple.This was a well made drink. Very good balance. We split a chopped salad,excellent. My guest ordered the three filet steaks with three separate toppings combo. One with bearnaise,one with hollandaise and I believe it was spinach and the last had a scallop and a shrimp on top.This is a great selection as it gives you a chance to sample three different types of flavors.I had the double cut lamb chops.They came with a pomegranate infused mint sauce that was one of the best I have ever had.Again great subtlety to the sauce,complimented the lamb to perfection. We ordered the mashed potatoes and the asparagus on the side. for dessert we had the creme brulee,again this was among the finest versions I have ever tasted.. From the moment we arrived to the second we left we felt as if we had been invited to a vip experience. From the welcome to the service to the meal,this was outstanding from top to bottom.
If you want to splurge on a very tasty dinner, Del Frisco's is definitely one spot you should check out. This restaurant is a change of pace since it is locatedoff the strip. The staff here provides impeccable service as well as an overall pleasant experience.. . The sesame bread that they give you is freakin addicting that I regret not saving room for my steak. I had their signature drink, the VIP (a pineapple infused vodka), but I stopped after one because it did taste like a bad hangover waiting to happen. I normally don't eat seafood, but I actually thought the crab cake tasted good.. . This is one of the very few places I've ever dined where I can say I was babied (in a good way)! They cut and served our lobster, served our lobster mac & cheese, served our potatoes au gratin, help split the humongous tomahawk wagyu into two portions, and even helped another Yelper take foodie pics muahaha. I should've visited the restroom to see if they wipe for me too!. . I had the prime ribeye which was awesomely delicious and cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested. It was a 16oz hunk of meat that I wished came in a smaller portion (never thought I'd ever say that). They definitely make it a priority to make sure the steak is cooked to your liking.. . We came here for a birthday, and it was a cute little touch that the staff all signed a card for the celebrant. We got to indulge in a six-layer lemon cake which was so light and yummy without it being overly sweet.. . I would definitely return in the future, but will make sure I come back with a bigger appetite.
This is my second time here and I enjoyed it both times. I really like the food and the pricing isn't that bad since its off the strip. I had the filet and it was prepared great. Just the way I like it. Also, they served my food on a super hot plate which is a cool thing. I like their wine selection and the ambiance is more enjoyable then other steakhouses since it was lit better...most of these resturants are dimmly lit. Our waitresses were really nice too. Next time I head over to Vegas, I will stop here again.
As a professional steak eater, I've been to my share of up-scale steak restaurants.  This one is middle of the pack, could have been a bit higher but.. I'll get there. Went Sat night before Superbowl. . The good. The steaks are top grade and cooked well. Well seasoned too. The atmosphere is classy steak joint, although the lights and ambience could be refined a bit more.  Our server was great, us 3 dudes, giving her a good ribbing, and she was fun and engaging. But that's about all that was good. . The bad. After being seated very close to our ressy time (8:30) we quickly ordered wine and then shortly after, dinner. The wine and tasty bread came, but no dinner.. Still waiting.. and still... 45 min later. We even had to ask our server what the hold up was and we rarely complain. I would expect this if we were on "Island Time"  in the caribbean. But this is Vegas and not acceptable.  I got the bone-in fillet which was very tasty, as were the other steaks at the table. But, the sides, grilled asparagus and garlic mushrooms, left much to be desired. Seems like not much care went into preparing these dishes, aside from dosing them with copious amounts of salt.  . Overall for the price, which was quite steep, I expect more. I've had much better dining experiences at steak joints for less then $600 (our bill for 3).  For that price, the experience needs to be grade A, top shelf, not  run of the mill average.. I won't be back.
Love this place, I feel like they make Ruth Chris look like the MacDonald's of steakhouses.  Great staff, they even asked for my address and my waitress sent me a thank you letter!  Wonderful place, delicious steaks!
I mainly prefer to get my prime steaks at Costco for usually $15 a piece rather than paying for overpriced steakhouses.  Del Frisco's is one of the rare exceptions.  What other place tells you to cut into the center of your steak and asks if it is to your liking?  Recommend the ribeye steak bone-in.
This has got to be one of the best steakhouses that I have tried. Came here on a Thursday and the place was packed. Lucky for us we made reservations the night before. . . I ordered the 16oz bone in ribeye steak and ask for medium rare. While the wife ask for the beef medallions. Started with the free bread which was a sesame white loaf. It was nice and soft and warm. . . When the entrees came out they had me cut the steak to make sure it was done right and it was perfect. The steak was so tender when I tasted it and also very flavorful. My wife beef medallions in her words was marvelous. Hadn't tasted any beef this good. . . For dessert we had the five layer cake which was a huge slice. And it went perfect with my coffee. Service was great and the ambience was very relaxing. . . If your looking for a great steak in Vegas.  This is the place to go.
Perfect food. Perfect service. Enough said.
Very, very poor service.  Mediocre food.  Will not be going back.  Definitely do not recommend.
My brother and I always try to find a fancy steakhouse when we go on trips.  I've been to many across the country, so I think I know my steaks.  My brother went here previously and told me that it was outstanding.  So, I couldn't wait.  It was busy the night we went and we were with a large group.  I ordered my favorite cut, ribeye medium rare.  The atmosphere was good, the service was friendly.  But the service was slow.  Perhaps I hit a busy night and was with a large group.  But my steak was not good.  My ribeye was the size of a filet mignon (so I guess they didn't like me) and it was almost well done.  When I complained, they tried to convince me that it was cooked properly.  Then they told me it would take a while since it was so busy to get a new ribeye.  I was too irritated so I didn't reorder.  Meanwhile I checked out my buddies steaks and they all looked overcooked too.  My brother was also disappointed with his meal and thinks we were the victims of bad luck/coincidence.  I'm sure he will come back since he got a great steak here before, but he will have to come without me.  If I pay a high price for steak, I expect a great steak which didn't happen.  I don't care if they are busy since that is no excuse.
ok so Del's is back in my good graces again. went back this week to celebrate my birthday and the staff did an amazing job at making our family feel welcomed. they had 2 high chairs already at our table and they even brought coloring books and crayons for our 2 year old. staff was very attentive to us and the food was amazing. everything tasted so much better than we remembered. we were a little hesitant bringing our 9 month old and 2.5 year old here for dinner so we booked 5pm RSVP but the staff made us feel very welcomed.
I've had premium steak in many places.. BOA, STK, etc and all I can say is holy cow this place knows how to cook and serve the best! It came perfectly cooked.. Like I don't know they can cook it so perfect cooked. It was like eating hot strips of mouth watering butter. The filet came perfectly seasoned and tender. The lobster tail came beautifully arranged, tasted good but missed the tenderness it usually has with warmed butter. They should serve it with butter but they didn't. Service was fun and quick after we got the order in. Only gripe is location which isn't close to the strip. No question get the filet mignon!!
Looking for a steakhouse? You're in the right town. It seems every casino has one, and the usual suspects are also here, as well as Brazilian and Italian steakhouses and meat markets of every variety. . . We visited Del Frisco's on Valentine's Day and were not blown away, although the food was really pretty good. The shrimp cocktail came with huge prawns, the oysters on the half-shell were fresh, the steaks were excellent, and a lamb dish was delicious after we sent it back for a bit more searing - it originally arrived nearly raw. The side dishes were good, too - creamed spinach with bacon, and lobster mac and cheese.. . The service was oft-putting. Way too aggressive. Almost like we were being coached...to spend more money. Back off on the up-sell, people. Your customers are going to overspend for dinner, regardless. . . Four stars for the food. Minus-one for the service vibe.
The service was great, but for the price, the food was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but I've had better for the same price and even cheaper. We spent $222 + $40 tip. . . The lobster mac and cheese could use a little more lobster. My wife's steak was a little under cooked. She ordered medium well, but it looked medium rare. . . The bread was delicious. The chopped salad was good. The filet mignon was ok.. . Overall, if you want to spend this much money on a meal, go to T-Bones Chophouse or The Charcoal Room. Definitely better options.
My heart sank as the hostess started to lead us away from the main section of the restaurant to a more secluded and far less appealing area.  But even though inside I was screaming for her to stop and take us to where the action was happening, sometimes even I get tired of being such a pain in the ass customer - so I decided to behave myself for once and quietly followed instead.. . We were shown to what I assumed to be the couple's section, and as a result, my date pretty much ended up sitting facing the wall.  Not cool when you're expected to drop $200-$300 on a dinner for two.  But Valentine's day weekend had made me all forgiving and pathetic and shit so I held my tongue, and there we sat in a thoroughly uninspiring, lifeless wood paneled room, away from any kind of activity or anything remotely interesting. . . Service was on the slow side.  Some guy who seemed to be the manager came and got our drinks orders first.  Then another person brought some bread and butter spread, but for the longest time our server was MIA.  When she eventually did get to us, she was very pleasant, and armed with good suggestions and helpful hints.. . The food was great for the most part: Caesar salad appetizer was tasty with just the right balance of everything, but the shrimp appetizer was not my favourite.  For my main course I had the half filet mignon, half lobster dish which was perfect and I enjoyed every bite. . . Sadly, due to where we sat, I have no solid idea what the restaurant actually looks like, nor what the atmosphere is like - we could have been anywhere really - so that was a bit disappointing.  I guess they think they are doing couples a favour putting them in a quiet spot so they can enjoy each other's company - but hey, I can do that at home - when I am out at a restaurant, especially for the first time, I actually want to experience the scene, not be shoved in a claustrophobic corner surrounded by dark walls!. . But overall, due to the excellent food and (eventual) service, this was a positive dining experience.. . My favourite part of the whole evening?  A completely unexpected James Bond related surprise: under lock and key, Del Frisco's houses a unique, one of a kind 007 themed wine collection, estimated at a cool $1,000,000 and pretty damned awesome!  Ask to see it if you're a fan.
Del Frisco's is outstanding.  I came for 9 days and am staying near Del Friscos, in an area where there are also a half dozen other 4-star-plus yelp restaurants within a short walk.  I've been trying a different one every night, and came back tonight for a 2nd visit to Del Frisco's.  I got the Double Eagle Bone-In Ribeye both nights and it was perfect both nights.  They have the biggest wine list I've seen in Vegas restaurants, and the wait-persons are prompt, efficient, and get everything right.  I'm in town one more night this visit and am coming back for one more Bone-In Ribeye because it's better than any I'm able to get back home in San Diego.  I am thoroughly delighted with the food and service at Del Frisco's and when I come back to Vegas in June, I'll be back to Del Frisco's again.
Absolutely the best steak!! Make sure you try the lemon cake, it is beyond amazing!! This place is top notch classy. Can't wait to get back to Vegas just so we can have dinner here again!!! You will not be disappointed.
My friend took me here for my birthday. I thought the food was excellent and the signature, pineapple drink was to die for!!!! We shared a shrimp cocktail and they were seriously the best shrimp I've had in my life. The filet was excellent and the sides were awesome. It's a little out of the way, and you probably need to take a cab, but definitely a great steakhouse.
I think the food OK here.  I don't think I got a great cut on my steak.. . Bone in Prime Rib Eye 22oz - $56 - Average 3/5. The prime rib was OK.  I didn't enjoy the cut of the steak.  The inside was cooked perfectly but the cut wasn't anything special.  Unfortunately the steak tasted a bit standard.  My friends steaks, on the other hand, came out much better.. . NOTE - . My friend tried this same restaurant in NY he warned us they tend to under-cook the steak.  For example, a medium will probably come out medium-rare, a medium rare will come out rare, etc.  The same incident happened here as well; 2 members in our party ordered steaks medium and medium-rare, and both were under-cooked and came out medium rare and rare, respectively.  As such, both members in my party had to have their steaks re-heated.  Not a big deal but something to keep in mind.. . Old Fashioned - $14 - Decent 3.5/5. I requested the old fashioned have a scorched twist.  The old fashioned was decent; it didn't come out sweet which is how I like it.  Unfortunately, I didn't think our server knew much about the drink.  The old fashioned came w/ a straw (usually it doesn't).  When my drink came the server scorched the twist right in front of me.  I found it odd the server scorched the twist (shouldn't this have been done by the bartender??), also she didn't scorch the twist properly.  The twist is supposed to be rubbed on the rim of the drink afterward (which it wasn't).. . Complimentary bread- . Sesame bread.  Really good & soft.  Yummy 4/5.. . Appetizers. Lobster Mac n Cheese -Decent 3/5.5. Mushrooms Sauted - Decent, 3.5/5. Potatoes au Gratin - Best, 4/5. . TIPS:. -Corkage $50 (yikes). - steaks have been known to come out under-cooked (which is detailed above)
Okay, one of the best steak houses I've eaten at!  . . I spent New Year's in Las Vegas and this was one of the places we went for dinner.  We were also seeing the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One after dinner so being in a slight rush, we were hoping they would be able to get our food out in time because we had to be seated by 6:45 pm at the Mandalay Resort.  Once we told them this, the serving staff were all very accommodating and stressed that they would put a rush on things.  . . I made a reservation through Open Table for 5:00 and they happen to open right at 5:00. Since we got there a little earlier so as not to miss our show, we had a few minutes wait before they could seat us so we waited at the bar. I ordered a VIP Martini which is their signature drink. Very refreshing indeed!. . We were finally seated and my friend and I each ordered the Prime Strip which was 16 ounces (1 lb.) of delicious aged beef.  We were first served some great bread and butter.  I also had the Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which was really nice, big and filling.  Along with the steak, we ordered sides of the sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with almonds.  Both were really delicious but I couldn't eat very much of it because I was getting really full from the steak which I was intent on finishing.  It was my main goal since I didn't want it to go waste and the besides the fact that it tasted so darn good, so tender with the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection, scrumptious!!  We asked the server how they prepared it and she told us so now I can hopefully replicate it at home sometime.  It'll probably won't be the same however because it never is when you try to do it at home.. . I enjoyed the dinner immensely do I will definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas when I want a  steak because they do it up right here.  They have a nice decor with dark woods making the ambiance really comfortable and inviting.. . If you're looking for a good steak house, I highly recommend coming to Del Frisco's because you won't be disappointed in the food or service.
Las Vegas is a city that built itself upon gambling, partying, and booze. A land where men can take their bachelor for one final hurrah and enjoy their final moments before the chains of marriage tie them to a small home in the suburbs with a van in the carport. When that opportunity arises to bring that man for a true "man's experience" nothing says it better that a crafted cocktail and a slab of meat. If you happen to be in Vegas, stray away from the strip and stop by Del Frisco. . . Del Frisco may not be among the most celebrated steakhouses and to be perfectly blunt, not one of the places I had ever heard previously, but it is true to its concept with the wood paneled walls, the grandiose chandeliers, and the starched white linen tablecloths to greet you. It's tables aren't amongst the most widely spaced, nor is it the quietest, but it certainly was comfortable and enjoyable for our group.. . The menu is your typical steakhouse fare with al selection of appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts filled with the classics you would come to expect. Nothing truly standing out, yet nothing missing from what you would expect. Our group started with the shrimp cocktail served with its 3 sauces: cocktail, italian, and mustard remoulade. All were decent, but nothing all that spectacular. The crab cakes lived up to its name with a very high proportion of crab and very little filler. Its cajun lobster sauce that accompanied it truly showcased the flavors of the crab.. . I opted for the 22oz bone-in ribeye and it was well seasoned and cooked beautifully to order. The flavors of the beef were highlighted and not overwhelmed by the butter flavors used in cooking and I have to say that while it arrived overwhelming, it was quickly consumed by this writer. In fact, he ended up eating half of his mother's filet mignon because it was simple, but that good.. . The sides available to order had high and low moments. From the lackluster chateau potatoes that were ok but overall unimpressive to the spinach supreme which was well seasoned and nicely cooked, it almost seemed that the only thing you should order is the steak. Then the lobster mac and cheese arrived and a new chapter was written. The earth stood still as the first bite hit my taste buds and took my breath away. It was a beautiful creamy symphony of the lobster and cheese flavors set amidst beautifully cooked pasta. You could almost see the smile of God at that moment.. . Food arrived in a well-timed orchestration and allowed for us to rest between courses and the servers were quick to serve in classic format that was quite impressive for a party our size. The waiter was incredibly patient and clearly well-versed in their menu and wine list which was pretty impressive.. . Price was rather reasonable (even though I was a guest and didn't have to pay) when you look at other classic steakhouses. Wines are a tad on the steeper side, but it is a steakhouse and the pricing wasn't that bad in that sense. . . When it comes to a need for a steak in Vegas, skip the $7.99 bargain deal and celebrate your friend's last moments of single-hood with a scotch and a fantastic steak that makes you really feel like a man.
