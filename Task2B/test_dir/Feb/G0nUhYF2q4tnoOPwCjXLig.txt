My husband and I were in Vegas in 2013 for a Helicopter convention (he's a heli pilot). We had an amazing experience at the Flamingo and they were my 500th review. I had hoped review #1,000 would be for our most recent stay at the Excalibur in Jan 2014. Bleh! What a nightmare. I have a pretty awesome memory, and there were so many horrible things about this experience that I actually had to start writing them down so that I wouldn't forget!. . We booked this trip just for fun and because Southwest Airlines had a good deal. It was less than $200 each for four days, our flights, and a rental car, plus $20 hotel food/drink credit. Which honestly is about what you can find anytime for mid-week, off-season in Vegas. The trip was supposed to include all taxes/fees but a mandatory resort fee for use of the fitness center and such was imposed upon arrival. Whatever, it was only $50 more.. . The robot of a woman who checked us in told us there was wifi in the rooms. I asked if it was free wifi and she said yes. While the casino floor has wifi, there is none in the rooms. So her misinformation was a little annoying. But worse than that was that around every corner of the hotel, someone is waiting to ask if you want free show tickets, free dinner, free this, free that. All you have to do is listen to them offer you a deal where you pay up front to come back to Vegas in the next year... blah blah scam.  We also had papers shoved under the door in our room with the same "please come hear our non-time-share presentation" bull sh*t written all over them. (As well as different pizza delivery places shoving their ads under our room door.) So much for respecting our vacation privacy. The last thing you want to hear while you're getting it on in your Vegas hotel room is some stranger at your door giving you unwanted advertisements. F*ck you, Excalibur.. . The $20 food/drink credit isn't valid at the Hotel Buffet which makes absolutely no sense, so we used it at the Steakhouse which was a joke as well. Gross service; average food. Everything about this hotel is below what anyone would consider an acceptable standard. I imagine they once had their glory days... but even the carpet in Tower 2's elevators (EVERY elevator) was worn down with holes, exposing the glue. Which was sort of funny since a flooring convention was taking place while we were there. The five minutes of work it would take to lay new carpet is probably something they could've secured a good deal on last week.. . We enjoyed the pool, but the fitness center that our resort fees were paying for was rather small. I still enjoyed it every morning. The adjacent locker rooms are an additional fee with locker rental for $25! Other spa prices were absurd as well. Every morning around 7:30 a.m. we received a new phone message telling us to check out their spa services. Every morning! An overpriced massage from this hotel? No thanks!. . Of all the hotels we gambled at (at least 10 or more), Excalibur had the worst drink service. It was non-existent. You'd think you'd get a drink if you sit at a machine long enough? Yes, we did. We got one drink the first night we were there. (It happened to be the best hot chocolate we'd ever tasted in our lives) but in the days that followed we never had the opportunity to get another drink. Walk over to Luxor and gamble there, or head elsewhere on the strip. This place sucks.. . The queen beds in our room on the 20th floor were horrible (room 20228). We slept in one the first night, (or rather, barely slept), and went to switch to the other the second night, in hopes it was better, but there were old blood stains on the sheets so we went back to the first bed. We switched to a king room on the 23rd floor (room 23269) the last night ($5 fee but they waived it for us). The bed was a lot better. Not like a Marriott mattress, but we finally got some good rest. Or perhaps we were just exhausted by then. The pillows were the best thing about the rooms. Soft, plush, large and wonderful. . . The "contemporary" rooms had bathrooms from the 80s with little showers spraying water with poor pressure. No bath tubs. At least they appeared clean and the towels were soft. Aside from check-in, the staff we interacted with were nice. Room service people we said hi to in the hallways were friendly and smiling. An awesome bartender brightened up one of our miserable days here as well.. . My husband and I had an awesome trip. We had so much fun - outside of the Excalibur at other hotels. We would never stay here again though, no matter what sort of outrageous deal we were offered.
Great value overall for a weeks stay! The hotel itself there was no problems with, a little old and worn but you could tell that it had recently been renovated or something. Room had everything that was needed (almost), big tv, comfy bed, safe, plenty of closet space, ironing board and a decent size bathroom. The room itself, huge in size also, I mean it was bigger than the room in my house back home. Seems like hotels in the US have an overall higher standard than what you get in Europe.. . I asked for a room on one of the higher floors and there was absolutely no issue switching me. The view I have to admit was pretty breathtaking, sun creeping in every morning, on the right was the busy  McCarran Airport and to the left was the strip. Room was secure enough too I have to say.. . The hotel had a decent sized food court upstairs, along with a couple of shops and a full buffet and restaurants. As for entertainment you've got your shows that are constantly on, access to the pool, and arcade downstairs accompanied of course by the main casino. Prices for things inside the hotel are expensive enough, souvenirs and the restaurants that is. The little corner store inside will set you back $4 for a bottle of water.. . The reason for only three stars is the downstairs lobby, casino, entrance and food court area is absolutely filled with people who are all trying to sell you time shares and each time you walk by, they stop to ask if you'll be back to Vegas next year. First day or two okay I can understand but having them approach you every day, two or more times is frustrating, they don't leave you alone. Another thing was the buffet, the breakfast was advertised both in the room and outside all around the casino at one price and we were charged a completely different price when at the till, the only explanation that the advertised prices are old. The main downside to everything was the lack of wifi in the rooms, okay it was free in the lobby, fine. But at this day and age, for a hotel that's on possibly one of the most popular streets in the world, for them to not have wifi in your room is ridiculous. They did provide wired internet (paid for of course, even if not used, part of a hotel fee) but in a tablet and smartphone age, it's about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.. . Location wise, can't really complain. If it's your first time to Vegas, stay here, you'll get a proper walk up and down the strip back to the hotel and see the entire strip in one go, if you've been before, probably go a little more central. Overall a decent stay for the money, and there is a $8 bus that brings you up and down the strip all day long.
The slots aren't worth playing and not just because ppl don't win at them that's all slots but in the 3 hours my friend and I played we weren't asked once by the cocktail waitress if we wanted a drink so after spending 400.00 and even more sober than we were than first started we were a little peeved. Planet Hollywoods slots not only pay out better but their waitress' come up to us before we've played out first penny
I will never stay here again 3 main reasons. . 1. Hidden resort fee of 18 bucks a day no biggie but then they charge u for things like using the pool fitness center prepare to get nickel and dimed . 2. Every were I turned some person was in my face trying to sell me a time share FYI if some person offers u a free show or a welcome package it's a ploy to get u to a time share sales pitch. 3. Poor poor service and restaurants and very pricey not a fun place.  . In short I go to Vegas to gamble drink and see a show I don't care what my room looks like but what I will not tolerate is being treated like a pice of meat or interrupted from gambling by some low life selling time shares. Do not stay here pay more for a more central strip location
Waiting for shuttle !!! Head to airport soon..was a good stay at this hotel ..cuz we got a cheap package with air n hotel $130 for 4 days..the room was in the tower 1..was old nut clean..very big compared to the newer rooms..
My second time in Vegas; first time on the strip. Decided to stay here because we got a pretty good deal.. . Positives:. -$20 food & beverage credit.. -Express monorail that ran between Excaliber, Mandalay Bay and the Luxor.. -Room was clean; Bed was comfortable.. -Staff was friendly and accommodating.. -Got free room upgrade.. -Food court and buffet available.. -Walkway to the Luxor.. -Safe in room.. . Negatives:. -Casino and walk ways felt crowded at times.. -Hotel lobby and casino looks worn.. -Stayed on smoking floor. Smelled like weed quite a bit.. -Far end of strip. Have to walk or take taxi to other casinos.. -Food prices high.. -Absolutely no water pressure in shower.. -Time share people are highly annoying.. . If you're wanting to stay on the strip but still stay within a budget, this may be the way to go. I would stay here again if the price is right. This isn't one of the high end hotels on the strip, but it's got all the essentials and will put you close to everything.
Excalibur is a hotel that is decent for what you pay for. It's not cheap or expensive either. Just right for the buck.. . Dated, yes very much so, but they provide a theme here like no other hotel on the strip.. . I wish they would stop with their promotional stuff, stayed here Thursday to Sunday and by Friday I had to be rude on their approach.. . Trust me, it gets on people's nerves because it seems like a 3D stuff it in your face commercial.. . Anyhow, it's been over 20 years since I last stood here and it seems nothing has really changed but the food options.. . Other then that it's just the same old castle.
we (3 Aduld) stay there for 1 week. It was great. A little bit expensive :(. but thats Vegas! . Enjoy!
With the boyfriend in Vegas for 3 weeks for work, what could be a better excuse for a little getaway? NOTHING.. . Because he's rooming with another guy from his unit, we figured it would be better for us to get a little alone time and booked a hotel room at Excalibur and was pleasantly surprised. Having previously stayed there with my parents as a kid passing through vegas, a lot about this hotel has changed...and for the better, i think. Here's the breakdown:. . 1. Located on the South side of the strip, it's slightly far from the center, but close enough to feel part of everything :). 2.  Rooms are decent sized, have a huge bathroom and offer the usual hotel amenities. I did notice there was no mini fridge, which i thought was a bit odd, but who wants to save food in their room when you have the whole strip to walk?. 3. The atmosphere here is typical vegas [loud, fun, full of music, booze and  fun!] but I was consistently annoyed by the sales people attempting to lure you into a conversation about "free tickets" when in reality nothing is free...unless you "sit in a short presentation about one of our condos" which we kindly replied with "NO!" and learned to not engage upon approach.. 4. This hotel has expanded quite a lot since i've last been here. The second floor is now a food court/mall combo full of just about everything you could want, including booze.. 5. Because this isn't the nicest hotel on the strip and closer to the south, we found the prices to be relatively less expensive than the rest of them!. . Because i didn't spend much time in the hotel [except to change or eat dinner once] i wouldn't mind staying here again.
Great average place to hang in Vegas. Not too pricey but not "cheap" either. Give it a shot!
Look, we'd stay here again because it's in a handy location and is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest on the strip. It's clean and actually a nice room. I'd really give it 2.5 stars.. . However, it's pretty annoying to be accosted everywhere you go by people trying to sell you something; show tickets, free stays in the hotel on your next visit.. . Upon our arrival we had not even checked in and we were nabbed by someone offering us 95% off tickets. Unfortunately the shows on offer were not the shows we wanted to see (although I'm sure there was nothing wrong with them). Working in entertainment ourselves we know it's sometimes hard to fill a room, especially off-season but don't try and make it out to be something it isn't ie. 'Oh, you're so nice and because you're a couple I want to give you a present.' No you don't! Start talking and they'll keep you there forever - but you're in Vegas baby and you want to get out! Once you tell them you're not a US resident they quickly change their tune.. . Everyone is trying to earn a buck, I get it, but it's full on.. . The casino was a bit quiet but it was January so all of Vegas was quiet. The restaurants were ok, our McDonalds in the wee hours of the morn had a guy working there who was a little crazy but I'd go crazy too if I were doing that shift.
Let's start saying that we had to wait so long for the vallet to park our car!! The whole parking lot is full always even the guest parking! People already started parking on top of the yellow lines!? I think about time to start investing in building bigger parking lots and hiring more vallet staff members after that standing for at least 30 minutes to check in! And the lady from de front desk having the worst face.. Like she hates this job didn't say anything about the hotel.. And then to wait for our bags to come to the room! I brought my laptop to connect it to the tv and not even that! Plus there is no wi fi!! They do false advertising saying they do but they don't! I managed to find the Ethernet cable and plug it to my laptop... The room service is ridiculous expensive coffee and Fruits for 50? The service was really not good! For this price I could've gotten something a lot better!!
Cheap, old, dirty. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because of the location. But you get what you pay for. The pool was nice and I recommend renting a cabana for the day. The beds were hard and uncomfortable but tower II is probably the easiest as far as in and out goes.
You get what you pay for. Cheap rates, but the service and maintenance of the hotel isn't that great. The walls in Tower I are pretty thin as well. Not sure how Tower II is. Probably not staying here again in the future.
I just recently stayed hear for 2days/3 nights and I must be honest I really didn't want to stay hear because of last time I was here. The rooms were humid,stinky,dirty it just wasn't good. But man oh man was I in shock when we checked in to our room in tower 2. The beds were nice and clean the bathrooms were nicely stocked the carpet was clean. There was no bed bugs or anything that crawls in the night. They apparently clean there carpets outside everyday at around 10:30am. On top of this we ended up going to dicks last resorts which is a bar to those of you that don't know. Just as an FYI if your going to vegas on a budget like I was, make this one of your stops good food, and great priced drinks. Now enough about the positive of this hotel lets talk about the negatives..  . 1. There was no fridge not a big deal but would of come in handy since we had drink. . . 2. It is pretty freaking far from the strip and if you are going to go out drinking and none of you want to be DD  a taxi will run you from $4.00 - $16.00 . . 3. You are near the airport and from what I heard if your in tower 1 you hear a lot of noise. I didn't have this problem since I was staying in tower 2. . . All in all this hotel is defiantly on my list again I would defiantly recommend it to people especially if you have kids pretty good fun dungeon. If you don't have kids and are on tight budget this is still a nice place to stay.
Horrible. Staying here because my friends are...no! Don't do it. I'm in Tower 2 which is suppose to be the better tower. No! Dirty. Stains. Scratched up furniture. Scuffed up walls.  I could've paid a little more and stayed at a nicer place. Never again.. . The only positive was that the staff I met was very nice. . . ***Update: I spoke to the Manager (Kendall) about the situation and he quickly offered different options to accommodate my situation. That effort was appreciated.***. . . Would I?!  After speaking with the Manager-Maybe. Mainly because I appreciate the Managers efforts and I don't like to stay at the large casinos/hotels because it takes so long to get out of them.
This hotel does the job when you are on a budget and need a bed to crash in. That's it! There is no bells and whistles to this place. You get a bed, drawer, seat, table, bathroom, iron and a ironing board. The rooms are decent and you get what you pay for but can you really complain for a cheap room on the strip. Besides, who the hell spends their day inside of a hotel room. It's freaking Vegas baby!. . Highly recommend for last minute shotgun trips.. . The last time I got a room here for the night, it ran me less than $150 and I check in at 4am! Ass clapping and bottle popping all night!
