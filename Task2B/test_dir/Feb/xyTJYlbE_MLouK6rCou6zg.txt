was in my top 5 burger spots in Las Vegas. Great service too.
I'm reviewing this place on only one item, Nutella milkshake. It's delicious, and the presentation is amazing (See pic below). Its very creamy and its a must have dessert on the menu. I will update my review for this restaurant when I officially have a their burgers.
I'm not a red meat fan so my review probably doesn't count ... but I was talked into coming here with a few other burger officianados who said this place was to die for. I saw on the Yelp reviews that this place was a hot spot for vegetarians so I agreed.. . I ordered the quinoa burger which was pretty good. Kind of a crumbly burger versus a more cohesive one (which I dont like) but the flavor I did like. We shared a fries trio which was great!
Phenomenon culinary experience! Flawlessly execution of concept. The Service was unmatched. The menu will amaze. Best restaurant in Vegas!
We had a $50 food credit to use and thought that Burger Bar would give us the best bang for our buck. Burger Bar is located one level 2 in the Shoppes area of Mandalay Bay, not in the Fleur/1oak nightclub area. Got there for an early dinner on a Saturday and there was no wait. We called to put our name down but they said it was first come, first serve. I guess they changed their policy based on previous Yelp reviews where people made reservations. . . We were seated at a booth which had a USB/110 on the wall! Perfect if you have your cable on you and have been depleting your battery while wandering around Vegas all day! Being the purist that I am, I went for taste and ordered the Kobe burger for $18 and added foie gras $13 which I can't get in California. The burgers come with lettuce, tomato, red onion and a pickle. K got the regular Angus for $10 with various toppings. We also got skinny fries for $4 and mozzarella sticks $7(!). The foie gras was pretty good and a decent portion for $13. It wasn't the best I had but it doesn't matter as much when you're smashing it on a burger. I had to have a few initial stand-alone bites. My burger was so juicy and flavorful, I just constructed it with the lettuce and tomato and that pretty much made it. Figured if I was paying $18 for a burger then I wanted to taste the burger and not a bunch of condiments. It was super filling too. . . I had a few of the skinny fries which were just fries. K loved his mozzarella sticks but I don't think it's worth it for $7. . . We had great service although when we asked about different menu items, she answered "awesome" to it all. Which was true but just hard to gauge the level of awesomeness for each item. . . Prices weren't cheap but not too outrageous. I felt for a hotel restaurant and location, it was a good experience.
Seems to me that almost every casino has a restaurant that specializes in gourmet hamburgers.  Even though this place was not directly inside the casino, it is in the mall attached to the Mandalay Bay.  There always seems to be a wait every time I come here and sometimes I don't have the patience and chose another restaurant.  It's a nice place and they have a fun menu.  The restaurant is long and narrow and small.  It makes you realize why you have to wait.  The burger was tasty although it may not be the best of Vegas. Service was friendly.   Believe it or not, I thought the burger at the Irish bar next door was better.  Still a good burger and experience and I will return only if I don't have to wait.
Love it! It seems like the burgers have gotten smaller over the years but still very good.
Seriously great burger!  I had the Naturesource burger which boasts no antibiotics.  I only added smoked Gouda cheese on a whole wheat bun.  It was simple and had a great flavor.  I was very impressed.  The skinny fries were good too.  I will be back for sure.
We have to eat at Burger Bar every time we come to Vegas for two reasons. The first is that I'm usually with my boyfriend and all his guy friends, and there are twin waitresses that work here, and have forever. The guys all think they're hot, and I constantly hear them all doing their Austin Powers' "Twins, Baisal, twins" impersonations. 2. The burgers are some of best on the strip. They have Kobe. They have buffalo. They have any kind of burger you can think of, and any way to top the burger you can think of. The appetizers are great too. I usually end up with an appetizer because I'm not a big burger fan... but other times the server will be very accommodating and make up a vegie sandwich for me. We have always had top notch service at Burger Bar, from the twins and all other servers we may get.. . One of my favorite things about Burger Bar (aside from it being right across the way from Lush where I love to shop) is that you can get a beer paddle with 6 beers. They are good size beers, and the beer menu at Burger Bar is expansive. There are so many beers you can try that are craft brews, imports, etc.
Burgers were awesome!! Hubby had the hangover burger and I did the build your own with provolone and jalapenos. Only thing I didn't like is that the jalapenos came on the side and were a combination of pickled and raw. I prefer raw myself otherwise it was a great burger!
This is our hangover recovery place. We love the burgers and bloody's they always get us feeling better! Love the selection to make a custom burger!
What a horrible experience! Let's start at the beginning. We were quoted a 15 minute wait time. It took 21 minutes to be seated. This normally wouldn't be so bad, except the app that they force you to download to check in doesn't allow you to get real time updates. . . Issue 2. Our drinks came out incorrectly...granted, one diet Pepsi, 3 waters and two sweet teas is a difficult order but at the same time, when told of the error, it took 7 minutes to get our accurate drinks. . . Issue 3. The food was Luke warm for 3 of us and completely COLD for another. When we advised the waiter that the burger was cold, we told him that we didn't have time to wait and one of us didn't get a chance to eat lunch. . . Issue 4. Upon inspection of the replaced burger in the car, the add ons that we paid for weren't on the "fresh" burger. . . Issue 5. Our server must have joined the witness protection program because he came around as often as Haley's Comet. . . Between the walk, the subpar food and massive mess ups, feel free to frequent burger bar at your own risk. . . My Thank You lunch for my team is now an experience that we will never forget.
The epitome of "meh". We sat at the bar, and waited quite a long time for our burgers to come out. When they did finally arrive, my American Classic burger was just OK. Kind of dry. It wasn't horrible (I've had much worse), but there was absolutely nothing notable about it. The truffle mayo side I ordered didn't taste like much else but mayo. The skinny fries were crispy, which I appreciated, but I wasn't wowed by what I expected to be a juicy mouth-watering hamburger.. I could have had Fuddruckers for half the price.
This place is definitely worth the long wait to get a table. Their food is really good and they offer a lot of choices on their menu, they also have an extensive liquor selection. I will definitely return.
Hubert Keller made his foray into gourmet burgers with the opening of his first Burger Bar in 2004. Shortly thereafter, several Burger Bars popped up luring customers with it's prime meats, tantalizing toppings and toothsome milkshakes. Whether you fancy an ultra-luxe $60 burger or if you prefer your burgers a little more spartan, Burger Bar can fulfill your needs. . . Give your burger the ultimate treatment and choose from a dizzying array of toppings, including pan-seared foie gra, black truffles, lobster, large shrimp, homemade chili, prosciutto, fried eggs, jalapeno bacon and more. . . After tossing a few options back and forth, I decided to go with the Hangover Burger --certified angus beef smothered in hangover sauce, chopped lettuce and served with fat fries. My friend ordered the same burger but the gluten-free version with sweet potato fries. We both relished every bite and lapping up all the hangover sauce with their tasty fries. . . The birthday girl choose the Hubert Keller Burger, which comes with buffalo, carmelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. This namesake burger comes with a beautiful red wine shallot reduction sauce and many sides of hefty smiles. . . And don't forget about ordering one of their signature milkshakes or choose from a staggering 60 ingredients to custom build your own milkshake. I had the Cowboy Milkshake -- whiskey and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate marshmallows. It's very rich,almost like a chocolate mousse, so prepare yourself for one decadent treat. . . Menu highlights include the American Kobe beef, buffalo, veggie, salmon, surf 'n turf burger with black angus and lobster tail. The Rossini Burger ($60) features wagyu beef foie gra and shaved truffles on an onion bun. . . Wonderful burger joint tucked away in the Mandalay Bay Shopping Forum.
A lot of the restaurants in big casinos put more emphasis on being eye-catching and different, while the food is too often an afterthought. . . This isn't the case at Burger Bar. For serving some of the most common food in our culture (ground beef), they really do it right. Sure, it's a little more than a fast food burger, but you'll leave more satisfied.. . All the burgers are tender, juicy, perfectly cooked, and the service has been top notch every time I've been there. The little TVs at each table are a nice touch also, particularly when you're with a couple chatty friends who are busy "catching up"; it gives you something to do while you savor your meat.. . Highly recommended when you're in the mood for a great burger.
great place
Wonderful gluten free experience.  Waitress was very knowledgeable.  Have GF buns, fries (separate fryer), and many GF beers and ciders.  Yummy burgers with creative toppings. Coleslaw burger, yes please. And since it's Vegas, I took my leftover cider to-go!
I LOVE this place! My fiance and I go at least once every 3 months and we've never had a bad experience. The food is always amazing, their signature drinks are awesome, and bartender Brian never fails to make us feel important.  He remembers our names, what we drink, and is always friendly and talkative. We'd rather go to Burger Bar than some fancy steak house any day of the week!
It is exceedingly pricey but oh so worth it.  I highly recommend anyone who loves burgers, that they try the Roussini at Burger Bar.  It's an experience.. . Being that the price is as high as it is, the burger is truly a once a year luxury... But damn is it tasty!
Long wait for large parties (2 hours +), but if you split up your group to like 5 people / table, the wait is less than 30 minutes. . . Lamb burger medium rare - lamb was not good (not fond of the spice) . Sliders - good. Sweet potato fries - good with the aioli sauce . Zucchini fries - kinda mushy but okay . Hangover burger medium - pretty good . Wings - meh. Shrimp salad - jumbo shrimps and decent vinegrette . . Overall, good if around Mandalay Bay but not something I'd come running back to anytime soon! But if I do come back, I'd definitely try one of their shakes next time. Looks amazing!
Great Place, Good Service,
