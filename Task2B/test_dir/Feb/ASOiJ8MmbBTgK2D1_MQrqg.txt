This was our third time dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, and the food was wonderful as always.  The view is spectacular, especially if you have a window seat as we have all three times. Our waiter was very nice and quite helpful with menu suggestions.  The evening would have been wonderful once again except that as the server was clearing our dinner plates he unfortunately spilled what was left of my wife's glass of wine on her dress.  He was very nice helping clean things up and explained to our waiter what had happened, but did nothing more than fill her glass with what was left in the bottle. When you pay $400 for a dinner, you would expect at least a replacement pour or a complimentary dessert, but we were offered nothing.
Lets just say this place is lucky they have a view to use as a selling point.  The servers are non-attentive and extremely scripted versus being genuine, if they even speak English.  I would goto STK over this place all day long.  Get a room with a view and order room service, you will be happier and probably save a buck.
There was a lot of hype around dining at this Vegas strip restaurant.  Our reservation was for a late dinner at 10:30.  We were seated at a window seat facing the strip and found the view to be cool, but very cramped and I'm a small gal.  Not much elbow room between each table.  The wait staff made us feel very rushed and seemed put out when we asked for a 2nd piece of bread.  The filet I ordered didn't have much flavor and was just marginal compared to other restaurants in Vegas.  All in all the experience was ok, just not outstanding in my opinion.
View of Bellagio water show is outstanding. Food was delicious! I may or may not have had their amazing banana souffle. (Yes, I did and would do again!)  The service was efficient. I dined alone and had made a 515 pm reservation to ensure a window seat. The efficiency is the reason for four vs five starts: the waiterade me feel it was more of a production than an experience. A bit more personalization would have got me to give five stars. It was def worth the money and time to eat here!
This place is a must when visiting Vegas.. It's a very romantic resturant and all the tables have views of the Vegas skyline.. . I do recommend going at night. The food was very good.. It is a bit pricey, but worth the experience.
This restaurant is up in the Eifel Tower at Paris Casino which offers one of the best views of the heart of the Las Vegas strip. It over looks the famous Bellagio water show. If you're taking a date request one of the tables against the window so you have front row seats to the water show while you eat. The food very good, I had the filet mignon. Wine selection is excellent.
So I know it seems silly to give this place three stars after a delicious meal but I'm pretty disappointed. I was primarily looking forward to a fabulous view but what I saw instead were the iron support beams littering the restaurant. . . What a truly lackluster experience. . The only tables with a great view were the ones directly in front of the windows.
My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday and wow!  Everything was perfect from the window table view of the sunset, Bellagio fountains, lights of the strip... the service, appetizers, main course, and dessert... even the drinks were amazing!  I had the filet mignon and my wife had the beef wellington... both were cooked exactly as ordered and delivered hot.  If you don't mind dropping a few hundred on dinner for 2, this is the place, but make sure you make your reservations early enough to get a sunset seating by the window.
Best food I have ever had with the best view of Las Vegas!
This is one of our favorite spots on the strip to have lunch and see a magnificent view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Perched upon the 12th floor or so the swank restaurant and full bar offer pent house style atmosphere.. . Prices are upscale with most lunch entrees ranging from $16 to $36.  We sampled the following items:. . Lamb Burger: a thick 1/2 pound crazy juicy mouthful of wonderfulness! Using Moroccan spices red peppers, onions and yellow squash this burger was one to remember.  Potato chips were served on the side $18.. . Eiffel Tower Burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.  The burger was good but not in the same class as the lamb burger $16. . Mushroom Pasta: fresh spaghetti noodles with a light sauce and mushrooms. Great flavor and just the right size portion $18. . French Cream of Onion Soup; creamy onion soup, I prefer the original version $6. . Lunch was also served with a Celery root puree which was a delicious bite and the some of the best baguettes ever!. . Since we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday she was presented with a beautiful chocolate mousse along with milk chocolates and jelly candies.. . Service was outstanding and although the prices were high it was well a great dining experience.  I highly recommend coming for lunch.. . Note: The Bellagio Fountains start at 12 or 1pm on the weekends.
Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.
From 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:. . Food - 4. Service - 4. Price - 1. Scenery/View - 5. . I only gave it a 2 because it was outrageously over priced.  The quality of food was good, but not something I would write home about.  You're paying for the ambience and view here, not for the food.
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!  I dined here for brunch for the first time and it was a true standout experience and one of the best memories I'll keep with me after this weekend. . . FOOD: I am not a huge fan of French Cuisine but this was good.  Great quality food and easy for anyone to eat if they aren't familiar with French food.  . . SERVICE:  FANTASTIC. Our server was very respectful and the server assistant was very attentive and respectful to give us our space when we wanted it.  I think she read my lips one time when I said I needed more coffee because before I could turn my head to get someone's attention she came with the coffee and said  "I'm here!" I was so impressed!  From the host stand, to the servers, and back to the host stand, I had the best customer service in Vegas at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.. . AMBIANCE: It was the perfect balance of comfort and class.  I loved the windows and the decor. . . VIEW: INCREDIBLE. I was able to get a panoramic view of the Bellagio water show but also an unobstructed view of the strip.  With the decor and the views that it offers, it is a new MUST-DO destination on EVERY Vegas trip in the future.  . . I will be coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant every time I visit now and am now open to staying at the hotel.  I haven't had dinner there but I definitely will next time!  I'm a raving fan!
My husband made this a Valentine's Day surprise for me.  Made 7:00 reservations and arrived at 6:40 to make sure we were punctual on what is always a busy restaurant night.  He read that this was one of the top romantic places in Vegas.  Imagine his surprise when we  arrive at a what can be best described as a madhouse.  People being herded in a line that took 20 minutes to get through.   After the crazy line, were asked to give our cell so they could text us when our table is ready. Very personal touch... Went to the bar to get a drink and wait and were TOTALLY IGNORED by three bartenders running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Romantic ambiance?  The elevator opened to, I am not kidding, the bustling, freaking kitchen!? How is that for  romantic?  As we entered the line, we passed an entirely too loud band playing what sounded like music appropriate only for a gin joint in the forties.  I kept expecting to see the lounge singer start stripping.  A romantic song was played once or twice, and I assume the loudness was to drown out the noise of the hundreds of people here.  We were acually seated at 7:30.  The most pleasant experince was the food, which was very good, but our "waiter" barely had four interactions with us.  When you pay almost 500 dollars for a meal, you expect great food served in an impeccable manner.   This place failed miserably to deliver the service aspect.  I felt SO bad for my husband,  because he kept apologizing for the choice to come here.  It's always the thought that counts and I was blown away only by his romantic gesture.  Only his wonderful company made the evening special. This place was almost a total waste of his money and for that I recommend that others not do the same.  For a better romantic and intimate experience,  I suggest Picasso ( where we went last year).  Really great food and truly top-notch service. Only the food makes this a two star review.
Got married on Valentines Day and booked an 8:30 dinner at the Eiffel Tower. It was a major disaster. Would never go back even if it were free. They don't care about anything except making a dollar. I paid $450 for a lousy meal for two that was 90 minutes late in seating. They should lose their license for breaking the fire code and allowing too many people into their facility to wait at the bar or in line for well over an hour past the reservation time. I say if you were there and younger than 30, tell everyone it's an old school place to avoid!
We went to this restaurant for Valentine's dinner with a group of friends.  First of all, the line to get in/check into the restaurant was huge and it was extremely hard to move around the reception area.  The girls who worked at the check-in station looked very stressed and overwhelmed.  It took us another 30 minutes to get to our table after we have arrived. The menu for Valentine's was pre-set which was a huge disappointment because it was not special at all and at $165 per person it was simply ridiculous. The food was very random. Service was not good either, food came very late, people didn't get their orders at the same time and it took 5 attempts until we finally were allowed to get some bread which came with attitude when someone asked for an extra piece.  Bottom line, all 10 of us were very disappointed with the whole experience and it was not at all what one would expect at $600 per couple (with wine/drinks that's what it came out to).  Can't recommend it and we are not coming back there for sure.
Highly recommended for a romantic dinner.. . Great food and good service. Prices aren't that bad for Vegas standards.. . I had the shrimp cocktail and the steak salad. Both pretty solid dishes.. . Kids salmon is also pretty good.. . The strudel and coffee are awesome!. . Cheers
This was my first time going to The Eiffel Tower Restuarant and I've got to admit I was very impressed. The amazing view over looking their impression of Paris and the rest of Vegas was mesmerizing. The Staff was very attentive and accommodating. The food was mouth watering from the appetizers to the entrees to the amazing souffle dessert that came in many delicious flavors. I will definitely be coming back here again and I highly recommend everyone to make a reservation and check it out!
