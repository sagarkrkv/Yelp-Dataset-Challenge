A little difficult to find, park behind the building and enter from the parking lot. Not the nicest area but the food is worth it! Absolutely delicious! We had 5 dishes, and would order all again. The standout was the sea bass over wide noodles, (recommended by our waiter) unbelievable.  Lightly fried, flaky and moist.  We could not stop eating it!  . Will definitely return here~
This is our first time here. I would never have known it was here if my husband hadn't heard about it from one of his fellow actors. It's a hidden gem. DH ordered the pork Moo Yang, I had crispy duck Panang (spice level 7). We got the tempura as an appetizer.. . The service is incredible. They work as a team, rather than assigning a particular waiter to a table. This means your needs are always met without waiting, and quickly.. . The wine was overpriced and only meh.. . The food, however - OMG. After my first bite of the duck, I needed a towel and a cigarette. Really good. It was perfect crispy, not too fatty, and spiced just right.
Lotus is legit. You know it's legit when your cabbie perks up immediately when you mention that you want to be taken there from your hotel on the Strip. During my most recent trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago, I boarded a cab from the Palazzo and indicated to the cab driver to take me to the Lotus of Siam. He simply said in his Yugoslavian accent: "best Thai food in Las Vegas...hell, best Thai food in the country! I love that place." It seemed like an honest review, but not Yelp Elite caliber. . . So here goes mine, hopefully a bit more fleshed out:. . Lotus lets people in around 5:30pm for dinner service. Knowing this, if you arrive a little before this time, you will see a group of people standing outside, all wanting to be the first one in. There's no order to the way people congregate outside, but there's an unspoken rule to just keep a mental tab as to who arrives after you, and when the doors swing open, to make it inside the restaurant before them. The sooner you sit, the sooner you eat! No pushing or shoving, though the temptation to invade others' personal space is strong as you try to think of what to order in advance in your head.. . As you shuffle inside, you'll be greeted by newspaper snipets featuring Lotus in the local papers. You'll see plenty of photos of famous people (both American and presumably Thai) over the years, enjoying the food at this Las Vegas institution.. . According to others in my group, the restaurant was expanded relatively recently to include the empty neighboring space. That effectively allowed the owners to add a wine bar and a wine storage room, as well as more dining space. It doesn't seem like there's much activity going on at the strip mall where Lotus is located, so the whole wing of the building can be converted to more Lotus as far as I'm concerned. It would be way better that way, really.. . Service has always been kind and friendly whenever I come here, as per Thai tradition. I've only been a couple of times, but with all the stuff I've ordered and shared with my group (it's an extensive menu), I did not find one thing I did not like.. . I recommend the jumbo fried shrimp/prawns to open things up. You can, and should, eat the skin. I don't usually do so with any fried shrimp, but the way it was cooked with the peppering and seasoning, it was almost like having twice as much prawn. Those will disappear in a couple of minutes (because of some secret crack-like substance that the cooks sprinkle into the batter, I'm sure), so I also recommend the yellow curry (though I don't think the color matters...they're all really savory and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking) and the fried, boneless catfish (either with curry paste or garlic pepper sauce). Eat that with a side of salad and some white rice and wash it down with some Singha, and you'll be golden.. . As mentioned earlier, you can take a cab here from the Strip if you're visiting from out of town, or drive your own car here. The only problem is getting a cab back to your hotel or next destination. You may want to have the host arrange a ride back for you before you sit down to eat, otherwise, you may have to go out into Sahara Road and flag one down yourself or pray that you find one just emptied of passengers intent on coming here in the parking lot. That would be called "Lotus luck" or, winning the Lotus lottery.
Yeah, well once you get over the fact that. You're in a beat down shopping mall in a beat down part of town, you enter a nice clean restaurant hopping with natives and tourists alike. The staff is excellent- they are very busy, so respect that, but they enjoy the small talk and are helpful and quick. . I look for vegey dishes, so it's a bit limiting, but I've been here several times and have always enjoyed my food. It's actually quite good, just wish the portions were larger. Price is extremely fair.
Surprisingly nice interior considering the ghetto commercial area this place is in. Would be hard to find unless you were looking for it.. . The food and prices here are on par with the Thai restaurants in SGV, which is a good, but not great thing. I had the pad thai and red duck curry, both which matched that description.
This place is as good as everyone says it is. Everyone I bring here goes back themselves.
Awesome in every respect. Great staff. Great food. Super spicy (on request). . . Will be back again and again.
A little over a year ago I watched the Top Chef Masters dine at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas and ever since then this hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant has been on my Yelp bookmark list, just waiting for my next trip to Vegas. Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me.. . Located in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America.  We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was "Lotus of Siam"...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving!. . Lotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more "peak" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait.. . I had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds.. . After the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, sauteed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection.  Delicious!!. . Next up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl!. . Our last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself!. . Last but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and  add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal!. . From start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV!
This place is legit. The dishes are full of flavor and have the perfect blend of spices. Crispy rice and fried chicken dumplings were fantastic!
Got our usual Pad Thai & Garlic Prawns, which again, ARE A MUST WHEN GOING HERE! We also got to try te Som Thum Seabass today. It was good. Kinda pricey at $29.95. But it was nice, refreshing, flavorful, and spicy. SPICY! I should say. Note to self, order mild next time. It was packed for lunch! It's always packed! Make reservations! So much better to go in big groups, so that you can order more dishes to try. But hey, when in Vegas, this place is a MUST. We get it to go if we have to, or I'll even have lunch by myself if the bf is at a conference. LOVE THIS PLACE!
Soup was just ok. I enjoyed the drunken noodle with prawns but preferred the crispy duck with panang sauce. So delicious!! Price was on the high side.
This was my second visit and I was just as pleased as the first.  We found Lotus of Siam via a new acquaintance last time we were in Vegas.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 on a Friday night.  They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.  . . I am gluten-free, and have been pleased that they will accommodate different preparations of certain dishes to meet that dietary need.  . . Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced.. . When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the "Senior" dining hour.
What can I possibly say about one of the most memorable meals I have ever had. This place is in the top three of best restaurant meals that I have ever had. We started with crispy rice that was so well balanced I am almost afraid to go home and cook again because I know I will never get to this kind of balanced flavor in any meal. For dinner we shared pad thai, short rib panang curry, and crispy garlic prawns. Everything that we had was better than the last. On a whim before we left we ordered some sticky rice that made the meal even better when I really thought that was not possible. I have dined at joel rubichon, Estatiario Milos, Nobu, and the list goes on of Vegas spots you cannot miss that I have not missed. This one topped them all, and for a bill of under 100 for three including drinks and dessert. I cannot wait to come back!
The BEST Thai food I have ever had. Mind blown. Didn't think it could be so good.. Short Rib Panang bomb.com, Garlic Prawns and Pad Thai... So good!!!
I live in sgv so I'm exposed to lots of Thai food. Lotus of Siam is a good, but not great. I had the crispy duck, which is one of their specialty. It taste good but not good enough to worth $25 dollars. I don't think I'll come back, unless I have a party that wanted to come.
This was my third visit here (first was tourist then second and thrid as a local) and I was not impressed with the food at all.  This place is overrated!  It is understandable for tourists whom donot know any better and always wanted to try places with longer line or impossible to get reservation.  But for local folks, there are better Thai food in Vegas.  My YUM WOON SEN SEAFOOD salad was salty and sour.   The same salty and sour taste was presented in PLAR DOOK O-CHA (Whole Fried Catfish).  The golden fried tofu was soggy, cold, and over price ($7.95).  My friend ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup and he said it tasted nothing but spicy hot.  My other friend got the Pad Se-ew and she was disappointed.  She is a local and said it tasted better several years ago.  She told us to try different places next time we come to Vegas and don't come back again.  My friends got wine and they said it was OK.  We skipped desert (fried banana) because there was no point after the soggy fried tofu.
In LV on business, and decided that I would make the trip to what was described to me as "Mecca if you love Thai food.... outside of Thailand, of course.". . I drove my rented minivan to the strip mall (yes, you read that right a minivan. Me. In a minivan. Oh, and the strip mall too... and no, there weren't strippers at the strip mall) on Sahara. As I hustled to the door (it was very cold!) the small, completely unassuming store front seemed quiet for a Wednesday night. And then I opened the door. . . The place was positively cavernous, given the little entryway. I put my name down and went to sit at the bar while I waited the estimated 30 minute wait (it was less!). The bustle of the place is amazing. The smells, the service... there's a great energy and an extensive list of beers and wines to get you started. . . Earlier in the night DH had told me to ask if they had a tasting menu (they don't, but what a great idea!) so that I could try more things. It was only by the stroke of luck that my neighbours at the bar and I shared a similar last name, country of origin, and is turns out, passion for food. When we were seated next to eachother, they ever so graciously shared their appetizer (heaven on a plate) and I shared my tom ka kai (holy crap was that good).  The Ginger Sea Bass was perfectly delicate. You'd expect the thai flavours to overwhelm the fish, but instead it was perfectly balanced and prepared, with the fish still having just the right bite.. . I'm a Pad Kee Mao aficionado. I eat it everywhere I can because it's my favorite and I'm always looking for the most amazing one. And thanks to my new super BFFs, I got to try not one, but two ways that Lotus of Siam excels at it - one with prawns and one with crispy duck. People, you can not go wrong. Order either. Order both. Eat all the things. . . I will absolutely, positively, with 100% certainty be back. Because there is soo much more to try and everything was truly flawless (including the service!)
Being that yelpers loves this place, we decided to try it. Overall, the food was good. However, I have tasted similar dishes elsewhere and it was normal for me. We had the duck curry, fried fish, pad Tai, drunking noodles seafood, salad seafood and tom Yum soup.
This place is amazing!!! The flavorful combinations of spices are like nothing I have ever experienced.  Every dish is so unique and flavorful!!   All the other reviews say enough I just had to add my 5 stars.  This place is amazing and I will not ever leave Vegas without eating here.  The staff is amazing,  it is quite intimate for being such a busy place, and the food is exquisite!! . . You must try this place!!
4 of us just came out of the restaurant very disappointed. Compared to most Thai restaurants this place lacks in quality of food and atmosphere and the prices are high. It's in an ugly strip mall and we expected authenticity instead found low quality and high prices. The place is designed to feed many with marginal service.
NO STAR!!!   Worst Thai food I have ever had!!!   I can't understand the awards and hype they received!!!   My friend and I have lived in Vegas all our lives...past this place a million times but never tried it.  Finally here...and Wow!  We felt like we were being punked.  The restaurant was packed. But as each course we ordered came out...I wasn't impressed at all!!!   . . $40 per person later...left feeling like an idiot for listening to all the hype.  . . Never again!!!  I would have been happier at Pin Kaow or Archi's and would have saved some money too.  . . What a disappointment!   Another Yelp fail!
This local favorite has earned a national reputation for its great Thai food. Although I have ordered off the menu a few times, I usually go to Lotus for their lunch buffet, and that's what we did today.. . At first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). . . I steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called "cilantro soup with egg." (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.). . The main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!). . Newbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town).
Wow, this place is very very hyped up.. In my opinion kind of overrated.. . They have pretty yummy soups. . They are always super packed so they take FOREVER!. . I think the food is good, but honestly I had better.. The menu is a freaking encyclopedia, so maybe I just haven't ordered the right thing?. . It is a local fave, so maybe it's worth giving it another chance.
Yummy and delicious. If you a food critic or love Thai food, this is the place. From pad Thai to Tum Yum, a ace that is a must try. The wine menu is awesome and can service any budget.
We wanted to come here because whenever we asked local people they said this place is must. When we arrived on after lunch time there were still line ahead of us and waited 30 minutes. It was huge restaurant with full of people and we tried famous dish from yelp review and very disappointed. Either too salty and too fried. Every dish has same sauce. We orderd 6 dishes and everything was same. Meh. . Simply Not Good.
This is the kind of place that has recieved so much fanfare and hype that it is impossible for the restaurant to meet such high expectations.. . I ordered take out on Mondy night as I was travelling through the city. The place was packed. I ordered the thai beef salad, beef jerky, and some sort of curry with beef short ribs. The beef salad was AWESOME. Exactly how I like it. The meat was tender and full of flavor. . . The jerky gets a mixed review. The pieces that I was able to chew and eat were really great. Great beef flavor with a great mix of spices. No sauce needed. However, there were a couple of pieces in the order that were inedible due to being too chewy and fatty. . . The curry was forgettable. The beef short ribs were not that great either. I ended up throwing away a lot of it. . . I definintely want to try other items on my next trip through LV. Worth the visit, but please order take out and avoid the crowds.
their khao soi (sp?) dish is awesome! great thai restaurant if you want to eat something off the strip. definitely recommend trying other things besides your typical thai food (pad thai, pad se ew, etc).
This place is over rated.  Service is good.  Prices are high.  Way hyped.  I was really expecting to be blown away with from what I heard.  Presentation was plain.  Good wine selection.  But to serve 20-30 dollar dishes and to have to-go chopsticks as your dining utensils?  Boo!  Don't believe the hype.  I couldn't believe how many celebrity chefs were pictured there... I don't believe they ate there.
This is Thai food. . . If you:. Think Thai food should be eaten with Chopsticks. Think mild salsa is too "spicy". Think Pad Thai is basically the only thing to eat at a Thai restaurant. Are driving 100's of miles to eat here, and are usually surrounded by lots of good Thai food choices. . Don't come here.. . . No seriously.. .  If you like Pad Thai, great but lets be honest- most places make pretty good Pad Thai, and it would be hard to make it better than most of the 4 million other restaurants. . .  . If you:. Really love authentic Thai Food. Are adventurous and want to try new things without going to Thailand . . This is the place to go.     . . Lotus of Siam is really good, not only for the quality of the food but the variety on the menu. If you are a stickler for quality curry, and like when you can tell from the color of the curry how hot it is. This is your place.
The hype, the fame, the name, the desire to be able to say I've been there and recommendations bought us here.  However, David V. captured it best when he stated that L.O.S. appears to have been "the" Thai spot a few years ago. . . AMBIANCE. L.O.S. is located in a sketchy little strip mall off Sahara. The interior is a clean, no frills decor, and the restaurant lacks a waiting area.. . FOOD   . Following Yelp recommendations, we ordered:. . -Garlic Prawns                                            (5 STARS). -Drunken Noodles w/Soft Shell Crab     (4.5 STARS). -Chicken Pad Prig Khing                          (3.5 STARS). . Our meal was good/okay, but when I think of L.O.S. I smile more about the people watching (which was super juicy) than the meal.
I say don't be fooled by the area that this restaurant in, because in this case, looks can really be deceiving. . . You wouldn't think a nice restaurant would exist in the area this place is in. The outside looks like it's a subpar restaurant, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised, or at least I was. . . The menu has a vast selection of Thai dishes to choose from. I was slightly bit overwhelmed, but I wanted curry, and they have a dedicated section for curry. A few seem like the same but under a different name, but I'm not very experienced with Thai food. . . I ordered the musaman curry and I admit it was tasty. I could taste the coconut and it blended really well, especially when topped on white rice. The meat reminded me of Vietnamese beef stew and it was quite delicious. It came with a few pieces of potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. I wasn't very impressed with the amount of food I was given and my table was given. We all were surprised at the amount of food we were given with the amount the food is. The $12 curry had the portion size of something $8, but I guess when it comes to quality, you can't argue right? I wouldn't mind coming back, but this wouldn't be my first choice for Thai food
We made the mistake of trying this restaurant without a reservation the first time and were told that it was going to be a 2 hour wait.  Oops!  We turned away and went to Border Grill instead, and made a reservation for 2 nights later.  I definitely agree with the reviews that mention the sketchy parking lot - divey area, surrounded by questionable businesses and we were accosted by several homeless people in the parking lot asking if they could wash the windshields on our car.. The menu is huge with tons of variety!  Several of the people in our party were very concerned while looking at the menu because so many of the dishes are listed with chicken, beef, or seafood, but like so many Thai restaurants, almost anything on the menu can be made vegetarian.. My friend and I shared the spicy beef salad, the roast duck curry, and the northern larb.  She raved over the curry, we both enjoyed the salad (although definitely the least interesting of our dishes), but my standout favorite was the northern larb.  Perfectly spiced, really interesting flavors, and something that is pretty unique.. Prices were reasonable, service was good.  Food was delicious.  I definitely recommend reservations.
The restaurant front looked less than impressive, and I was slightly turned off by the ghetto strip mall vibe, but took a chance because a friend said I would love it. . Oh boy, did I!! Be ready to wait up to an hour during regular dining time (6:30-8:30), but don't worry, once the food gets in your mouth you'll totally understand why so many covet this place. This is probably the best thai food I have ever had! It is no wonder why they have so many Zagat awards!The decor is whatever, but honestly I would eat in a card board box as long as they would serve me. . We ordered the crispy duck panang, the seafood drunken noodle and the thai barbeque chicken. Delicious! Everything was amazingly prepared and I got so excited I had to be stopped from ordering more to go. I can't even say what I loved the  most! I will definitely come back to try more! It will be my new Mecca of every trip I take to Vegas!
"Most Important Restaurants of 2013"!  Good food, decent price, and friendly service.
I don't normally enjoy eating Thai food, but this place was pretty good! . I really enjoyed their pad tai (don't know how to spell any Thai food), and other dishes.. some fried rice, stuffed chicken, two kinds of soup (same soup but different main ingredients- one had chicken and the other one had shrimp), another type of noodles, and some other stuff.  Since I made a reservation the day before we didn't have to wait and were seated immediately. The area was pretty ghetto. We weren't sure if we were at the right place at first...but yup! It was the right place! Willl I come back here again? I will if I'm ridiculously craving Thai food.
By far the best Thai food we have ever had in the US.  First off it looks like a complete dump from the outside and you go inside and it is very nice.  Huge Wine selection, nice decor, great staff, clean bathrooms. . . The food is unbelievable.  The pad thai is simply amazing.  The shrimp for appetizer is lightly breaded and fried and you eat the whole thing which is odd at first but so good.  The drinks were great. The duck was probably the best we've ever had, very crispy.
Absolutely delicious. This place came highly recommended, and it is clearwhy. We shared a variety of dishes and everything was wonderful. The drunken noodle prawns were a favorite, and the pad Thai was the best we've ever had. They also had a seriously impressive and extensive wine list, and great service.
Wow! I don't know how anyone in our group found this place or heard about it, but after spending so much time on The Strip, a trip off the beaten path ($15 to $20 cab ride - and the cabbie knew the name of the restaurant, didn't need the address or anything) was very welcomed. Went on a Sunday night with a group of 4....so not a super big group or a super busy night, but we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Always a good sign.. . Our waiter was super helpful and always had an immediate opinion when we asked for help deciding between 2 dishes, 2 wines, etc. Highly recommend appetizer #14 (the crunchy rice), any of the fried catfish sides/dishes, and the sea bass with drunken noodles. Best green curry I've ever had, and this is my litmus test at any new Thai restaurant I visit. Spice/heat is totally customized on a scale of 1 to 10. Our group ranged from 6.5 to 9.5.....definitely felt it, but sooooo yummy!. . "Normal" prices and generous servings....we were all heartbroken we didn't have a fridge for our leftovers and couldn't take them with us. Will definitely go again on a future trip.
Yuuuuuum, this place is great! I came here during a weekday so there was no wait, but still a lot of patrons! So be careful if you're going to come here during the weekend. By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!. . The food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.. . I love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it.
I eat Thai food all the time, have eaten at numerous Thai restaurants across the country and in Thailand and am of THAI/American ethnicity.  That being said, this place is really good.  To be fair I would probably say a 4.5, but there are somethings that could improve.   Definitely the best in LV that I've had, and I used to live here for part of my life.  I'm sure some people have had a bad experience for various reasons, but here's my take.... . Good news:  Phad see ew, drunken noodles, and curry's are some of my favorite dishes.  Phad Thai is also good here (and I'm not even a big fan of that- we had fried tofu in ours- delicious!)  If you can handle the heat try the green papaya salad (som tom)-  It's a small serving but your mouth with be crying tears of joy and pain from all of the fire.  I wanted to try the beef salad but haven't had a chance yet.  I also love Thai deserts so Khao Neeo (sticky rice) with coconut and mangoes was good here (mangoes weren't super sweet, but weren't in season so not necessarily their fault).  . . Bad news:  the area is sketchy, and there is really no way to make reservations (the email thing is useless), so show up before it opens if you have a large party to put your name on the list or be prepared to wait.  The portions are smaller, but everybody at our party was stuffed (party of 7) for only about $130 (no alcohol).  That's  deal for good food in my mind for Vegas.  So order tons of dishes and do what we do. . .share.  . . Once your inside the service is good and the people are friendly.  . . We usually make it a point to eat here when we are in town.. . Arroy Mak Mak!  (very delicious)
the best Thai food I have ever eaten! Omg!!! This place is a must try if you're in Vegas.. . Food- between my husband and I, we ordered five dishes and we cleaned the plates because it was so delicious. We ordered Nua yum katiem (marinated beef), drunken seafood noodles, crispy duck with curry sauce, papaya salad, and sticky rice with mango. Each dish were so flavorful. The only dish I probably wouldn't order again is the Nua yum katiem. It was the only dish that I felt like there wasnt a party in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, it was still very yummy. I wouldn't order it again only because they have such an extensive menu and I'd like to try new dishes.. . Service- attentive and helpful. I had a very bad experience at a Thai restaurant due to their spice level. If you're from LA, you've probably heard of Jitlada. I ordered a dish and they never asked for the spice level or neither bothered to explain how spicy the dish was. It was to the point my head started hurting and I couldn't eat anything afterward. Well unlike Jitlada, this restaurant explain the spicy level and what was appropriate for each dish.. . FYI- wait is always long. It's about an hour wait.
