I have been to Red Rock many times. I gave it more than a fair shot.  Now  I only go back for IMAX.   . . Overall, Red Rock consistently misses the mark on food and service in every area. It's rare to find a casino where every restaurant has problems, the club is a joke, the bars are bad (attitude cases) and basic casino operations are lacking.. . I'm a huge fan of IMAX 3 D big block buster action movies (aka I AM perfect movie date because I will never see a chick flick!) and I like the theaters because they still feel new and are always clean .   . . Aside from that I just avoid the place.    Too many other great places to spend my money I don't need to put up with poor service, bad attitudes and some blantant rudeness thrown in for extra measure.  . . Harsh?   Yes...  But every experience outside of movies had turned out to be a hassle to awful so I have to call this one as I experienced it.. . BUT IMAX ROCKS!
The prices are reasonable. Their is a free shuttle to the airport and to the mall on the strip. Room was very nice. The pools were beautiful. They have a bowling alley and a movie theatre for those of us who are not gamblers! The best part for me is that I didn't know it was a smoking casino until I saw an ashtray!
We stayed here two nights, and it was wonderful.  The room, the casino, the food,the staff, the outside pool....everything was great!
First time visiting the casino and I fell in love with the place.. Very clean, classy, had some good modern tunes rocking through out the place especially when Muse came on.. that was the point I knew I was in the right place lol.. friendly staff all over the place from the cocktail waitresses, slot attendants, security.. everyone seemed to be happy.. beautiful location off the strip and worth visiting.. easily 1 of my top 10 casinos in the country now.. Station's delivers again a great casino!
If you want a place that's close to the strip then Red Rock is not the place.  It's about a good 30 minutes drive so be warned.  The rooms are nice, bed is very comfortable. There isn't a lot of lights in the room so you definitely have mood lighting.  I love the two Starbucks, food court and the cool arcade, but one thing that really disgusted me was this: When I went to sit down on the couch to put on my shoes and I don't know if it's a girl instinct but I usually look at where I'm siting before I sit, I see a "crusty" white stain on the chair.  I took a picture it and sent it to my husband and he was thoroughly disgusted and he told me I was definitely in Vegas.  I didn't want to change my room because I already unpacked so I just told myself to stay clear from the couch.   I was seriously disgusted.
I really like Red Rock Casino. They have a pretty good arcade, bowling alley, and movie theater all conveniently located right next to the parking lot and food court. Most of their restaurant are pretty good as well. It usually isn't hard to find parking and it's almost never crowded. Their rooms are nice, but since it's located so far from the strip, you don't really get a view like the other hotels.
This place is a great respite from the hustle and bustle of strip casinos and the smokiness and chaos that is now Fremont St. Very clean, loose machines and a plethora of other non gaming activities. Such as bowling, cinemas, arcades, and of course your very own food court with great eateries. Capriottis, Panda, Fat Burger, Lucille's BBQ. All good eats.. . I've never actually stayed here though, so i cant say anything about their rooms. But if the rooms are anything like the casino floor, then you should have nothing to worry about. The floor is super clean and non as smoky as most casinos.. . I've won most of my dollars here, so take solace in that fact that someone actually wins a buck or two in Vegas.. . Have fun. Be young.
