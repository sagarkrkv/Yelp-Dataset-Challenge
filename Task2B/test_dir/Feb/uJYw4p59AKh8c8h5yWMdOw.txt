Solid casino on the Strip. I don't go out to the big-name places much, but somehow I've found myself at PH three times in the last week or so- hit up Koi for a Yelp event, then the V theater for an Elvis show, and then the buffet using a Groupon. And let it be said, even though I didn't spend much here, you certainly can drop a lot of coin here. But there are also plenty of deals to be had here, too.. . Parking is pretty simple- love how easy it is to hop in the garage elevator and step out at the Miracle Mile shops, past the theater, and then to the casino. Decent poker area, lots of slots. Restaurants are all pretty solid- Koi is overpriced IMO but tasty and a good place to be seen if you're into that sort of thing. Their crispy rice app is to die for too, BTW.. The buffet isn't among the best on the strip, but it's decently priced and has a larger selection than I expected. And the Heart Bar is good for people watching and has dancers for entertainment, too.
Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a COMP as -"given free as a courtesy or favor" Apparently Ceasars/Harrah's Entertainment does NOT!  Since my comp room cost me $70 for 2 nights with their bullshit resort fees and taxes.  These resort fees where they give you nothing for something really have to stop!  It's the equivalent of going to a restaurant and being charged a utensil fee.. . Additionally, my smoke free room on a smoke free floor had smoke permeating from somewhere.  And I'm not sure if PH is now pet friendly, but somebody's dog had definitely pissed in this room because it really stunk like dog pee.  I was going to look with my UV light but thought better of what other atrocities I might uncover.. . For locals PH has by far the most inconvenient and furthest self park lot. I actually parked at The Cosmo because it was closer to my room.. . On a final note the shower-heads are old (probably original) have not been cleaned or replaced and are undoubtedly full of Vegas' hard water deposits which turns the shower stream to barely a trickle.
Rooms look beat up. Toilette handle stuck. We requested no fragrance when making our reservation.  We checked in, went to our room and found that it HAD been sprayed with VERY PUNGENT FRAGRANCE. We asked for the manager who denied that they use fragrance on property at all.  Which is a lie. They charged us $100 for the night plus the $20 resort fee. We never even stayed in the room nor took our luggage up. I will never shop in the Miracle Mile shops or go to PH again.
I am only giving this hotel a generous review of two stars based on the hotel amenities itself NOT for its hospitality. I cannot believe that I am trying to sleep in an uncomfortable chair in my room because they are incapable of cleaning it... particularly the blood stained sheets and towels we were given the day before. I wish I could say I didn't sleep in these disgusting sheets but we only noticed the next morning. I have the flu and called the first time at 2:30 pm to let them know we were finally leaving the room and we needed it to be cleaned (ie blood stained sheets and towels). When we came back at 10:30 pm it had not been cleaned. My husband and I called at the beginning of each hour after that until 1:00 am. The manager at the front desk gave us several excuses for the failure to clean ("do not disturb sign left out?" No!, "maids changing shifts?" In 12 hours and at least 5 calls? No!) There is no excuse! . . You know... I was going to ignore the annoying lamps in the room that turn on only 1 out of 20 times, the tv remote that also hardly works, the broken bath faucet, and no mini fridge or microwave, but seeing as how they totally fail in the hospitality department and cleanliness department I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone.. . I'm disappointed because I wish I could say different.
Upon entering the casino, I asked a man in a purple blazer (who obviously worked there) for directions to Koi restaurant.  He sweetly replied, "Let me show you young ladies (we are all in our 40's;)...you are all my boss and I need to make sure you are happy!"  I could have hugged him!  How adorable and uber helpful of him!  I'm sooooo mad I didn't get his name for a proper shout out!  . . I have stayed here once (a few years back)--my room was clean and fine and there were no zero issues.  My guess is that Planet Hollywood is stepping up their game with Britney as a resident for the next 2 years.  There was staff everywhere, managing the lines and crowds effortlessly.  It makes me happy to see them re-inventing themselves and looking good.
When I heard some extremely loud mariachi music blaring in the hallway as I slept, I thought I was dreaming and that the louder it got, it was a punishment for whatever I was doing in my dream....but it was REAL! It was also probably around 3 or 4 in the morning, so I didn't really appreciate it.. . I know it's Vegas and people are likely to be crazy drunk, which also includes being obnoxiously loud, but both nights here this weekend were punctuated by several awakenings by some rather inconsiderate guests who were intoxicated beyond any manners. Needless to say, this experience has strengthened my relationship with my own bed. . . The room itself was okay. Nothing to Yelp about.. . I liked the casino, and since I was there for the Britney show, I was able to appreciate all the Britney-ness plastered everywhere from the elevators to the chips and tables. The Heart Bar even had a list of drinks named after some of her hits. . . The dealers here were all pretty nice. Only one bothered me a bit. I knew I would be ID'd as soon as I sat down at the blackjack table, so I had my wallet out and was in the process of pulling out my ID when BB demanded (not "asked" as the other dealers kindly did) for it. I told her I was pulling it out for her. Her head ping-ponged up and down, over and over at me and my driver's license. It was clear she was skeptical, and I don't have a clue why. Even though it shouldn't have, it made me feel a little embarrassed because it held up the game and put the focus on me as if I were doing something wrong.. . My favorite slot machine here by far was the Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin. Just wanted to throw that out there. Loved getting those wheels. Lol!
Planet Hollywood has a perfect location on the strip, right in the middle of everything. However, compared to some of the other hotels, it can definitely use a bit of an overhaul. The bathroom was dated, but HUGE, and our room had a huge red cocktail stain on the carpet, which was pretty gross, but we had an amazing view of the strip. We were there over a holiday weekend and affordable pickings were slim, otherwise I don't think we would have stayed here. The check in situation was also incredibly awkward with long lines, limited staff, and no lobby area to sit down. We had kids with us, so it wasn't like I could go hang out with them in the casino. If they spend some money updating and remodeling, this could be a great place, though.
I normally stay in the regular significantally  lower priced hotel/motels whenever I travel. But this hotel experience goes down in my history as THE most disgusting ever. . . Upon my arrival to my room I immediately discover these horrible stains and chunky crud on the comforter, that was neatly placed on top of my bed that I paid 114 per night for.  I tried calling the front desk to complain and after about 2 hours of them not answering I finally just called housekeeping to give me clean linens.  When the housekeeper came in, the look on her face was priceless.  I think she was even more disgusted than I was.  She made sure to completely change everything to ensure cleanliness and said she felt embarrassed that her peers didnt catch that before. . . Anyway, I didnt have time to deal with the front desk to get upgraded to another room....one because it was a hassle sine they wouldnt answer the phone...and two I was in Vegas for a reason and had plans to attend to.  So I overlooked the burdon of the digusting bed only to discover, after a night out, that the bathroom floor had dried droplets of vomit on he bathroom floor. NeedI say more? . . It wasnt just the filthy condition of the expensive room, it was also the fact that the room was severly in need of an overall renovation. The caulking around the tiles in the bathroom was dirty and disentigrating, the shower drained slowly...sure to give you toe fungus and the sink faucet had cruddy crap all around it.. . I originally wanted to stay at a $35 a night hotel, but friends convinced me to "splurge". And this is what I get for splurging??? I would expect the actual condition of this room from a cheaper hotel.  . . You may want to rethink your choice of hotel unless you want to deal with the hassle of getting upgraded to a better room. But judging by my friends who had a supposed upgraded room...it was not at all any better.
Planet Hollywood hotel really ruined, what suppose to be a wonderful early V-day celebration to one of the worse nights in Vegas ever! . . We arrived on Monday evening and after a long 3 1/2 hour drive we were ready to rest in our rooms before dinner. Right when we opened the door a gust of hot air blew right at me and I immediately dashed for the air vents. . . After 10 minutes the air was still hot, so we called front desk and they said they would send a guy up. I laid down and rest my eyes and after another 10 minutes..it was STILL hot and no maintenance guy to be seen!? We called AGAIN and they said someone will be up soon...so by this point my patience were running low and it was now 7:30 pm and i was starving! Soooooo after laying down and waking back up again due to the ridiculous heat, there was still no magical knock on the door! . . Being in such a hot room for over 30 minutes can really dampened anyones mood! I  complained to my guy and he finally just asked the front desk for a room change! This obviously led to a terrible fight between the two of us, cause he's super patient and he didn't want to keep calling to ask for where the maintenance guy ! . I was so annoyed that the front desk didn't just offer that to begin with and stop sending us false hope that someone will be saving us from that devil of a room! . . When we were changed into a different room, I saw a piece of pubic hair sitting on the bathtub!?!!?!? GROSSSSSS !!
Way over rated--$150.00 room was shabby--worth $20.00-- Glad I got a price match with NY-NY-- woodwork beat-up-blinds did not work--carpet was loose--all prices in the hotel were way out of line--especially drinks--$6.00 for a draught beer --also internet was $13.99 per day --so didn't  use-- but was charged anyway-- and no refund as it is a "corporation charge" so we can't or will not  do anything for you--- . WIILL NEVER BE BACK--RIP-OFF. . GNFSHN4
Got a very cheap deal here since I'm a Total Rewards member. Got three nights for about $23 a night. Check in line wasn't too bad, had to wait about 20 minutes. I tipped the hotel clerk $20 and managed to get a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris balloon/tower.. . The walk from the self parking lot is pretty far to the hotel lobby, but we were expecting that from the reviews we read. We just used luggage with wheels and the walk wasn't an issue. The room was clean upon arrival and was quite large considering it was only $23. The bathroom was HUGE!. . While our stay was acceptable for the most part, we had one issue on our first day there. After settling in, someone decided to open our door, I'm assuming housekeeping, while both my fiancee and I were undressed. From what I understand, hotel staff is supposed to announce themselves when entering a room. There was no announcement from whomever opened the door and they closed the door before I could get to it.. . If it was housekeeping that opened my door, their entry was done on purpose as housekeeping was outside my hotel room door upon arrival. The staff even moved their cart out of the way since it was parked in front of my door. SO I find it hard to believe that housekeeping had no idea we were in there.
Terrible hotel. Terrible experience. First we get to the hotel and have to walk very far from self parking through all the shops to get to the lobby. We then wait 20 minutes in line, check in, go to our room, open the door, and we are confronted with a strong smell of marijuana. We were very displeased, called down and got a room change. We got a downgrade to a smaller room that smelled like cigarette smoke (we had asked for non-smoking and there was clearly an ashtray and matches on the table). We called once again and the front desk (mind you, it rang for 10 minutes until someone answered) and they said there were no more rooms, and the only thing they could do is comp our resort fee which is $20. Also, they charge for mini fridges. Unbelievable. Do NOT stay here. We stayed at Treasure Island our first night and had a much better experience. It was a third of the cost and SO much nicer.
Parking lot located clear out beyond the mall inside of the hotel.  Makes for quite a long walk.  Pool is also not located very wisely.  If you want to go swimming you have to walk thru the mall in your swimsuit and towel to get to the pool.  Stupid!  It's all about how much more they can extract from your pocket before you make it to your room.. Hotel has odd smell throughout.  Room was clean, although the door on the entertainment center was ripped off.  Bathroom was roomy and tub very large and welcoming.  . My husband and I were approached twice by women in the hotel asking if we wanted company.  Uh, how about HELL NO!. I won't be going back here.  I only went here for a medical convention for work.
Stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference. When we arrived, the line to check in was not bad. We arrived early and we were able to check in early, for a fee, $28 I believe. We were told if we waited 1/2 hour, the fee would only be $15, but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons. They also provided a refrigerator in room free (normally $25/day) for medical reasons, which is that I had medication that needed to be refrigerated. . . Entering the room, I noticed one bed was seriously concave, but the other one was fine. There was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed. We informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didn't care enough to change rooms. The carpet was loose, looked like water damage to me. The TV was fine, but has absolutely NO jacks, so you can't hook anything up to watch movies or music or games. They do charge for internet, $13.99/day, PER DEVICE!!!! Good news is Starbucks and some restaurants have free WiFi. . . The bathroom was huge and very nice, but the shower was weak. The bathtub is awesome and easily fits two, but ours didn't drain. So, called maintenance. They didn't fix it the first night(GROSS!) but the second time we called, they snaked it, made mess, housekeeping came to clean, whole process took about three hours. I assume the issue was resolved, but we didn't use the tub again after that. Also, when people in other rooms shower, it is loud as hell, but I never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lol.. . We called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues. The girl that answered, Olivia, has a thick accent. Apparently she was saying "manager", but to us it sounded like she was saying "money gift", and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding. She was rude, accused my gf of laughing at her, and then hung up on her. Call back and got the GM Brian. He was a dick from the start. He offered to give us a free late check out, which we already had arranged. So, he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge, a total discount of $36. . . While speaking with Brian, we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasn't ours. So, we called the room service manager, Pharrin. She was absolutely awesome! She immediately looked into the incorrect charge, took it off our bill, and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning! . . Overall, it was OK and mostly our individual room & the front desk people that got the 1 star. I would stay there again. All the fees are kinda ridiculous, but there are ways around those.
we did not have a good experience, as much as I have loved Planet Hollywood in the past, during this visit...not so pleasant.  we arrived and got stuck in the Keanu Reeves "Speed" suite, not my idea room, but ok...no biggy.  as soon as we walked in, not as clean as I would have liked but we had a great night in vegas, came back to the room slept, when I woke up I had lost an earing, looked under the bed to locate it and saw this weird grey tube.  like a small nitrogen bottle, then my husband found more near the seating area! it grossed me out so much. then when I called a manager, all they offered was for maid service. WOW.   never will stay there again.
Horrible!!! Will never stay again! Dirty bathroom (pubic hair in tub), broken furniture (missing door on cabinet and unable to hang clothes). Complained and was offered an "upgraded room" at a charge. Really?? How is that appealing? They waved the charge when I complained, so nice of them. The new room was nicer but we lost our view of the fountain which was another disappointment. The casino floor was way too loud all the time! The only good restaurant was the burgr, and I would eat there again.
my favorite hotel in vegas from the l.i.v.e. video d.j. n.i.n.o. jamming the hits to the stores in the mall.
I've been to Vegas a few times, but never stopped by Planet Hollywood. We had a great time at the shops and I played 3-card poker for a while in the casino. Both of the dealers I had were great and the cocktail service was prompt as well. I would definitely come back!
Not the nicest hotel, a little ghetto but it was cheap & we were there to see Britney. . Next time I would spend a lil more & stay at Cosmo or Aria across the street.  . Pool was closed.  Shopping was great & customer service at front desk was excellent.  They upgraded is to a resort room at no charge when we complained about our first standard room-it was literally the size of a dorm room. It's just an older hotel & attracts a lil more of a scuzzy crowd. Earls Sandwich shop was a great & yummy, affordable, & quick option.   I prob wouldn't stay here again but have it 3 stars because it was convenient for Britney show, affordable room rates & customer service was very good.
I decided to make a last minute trip to LV to join my family celebrating a birthday.  They were staying at the Bellagio for four nights.  I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.. I won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider "current Strip standards".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly "trashy" feel to it. . Some of the issues that I had regarding the room were:. - missing front of one of the drawers. - strange odor from the faucet water in sink. - pull chain shades that kept sticking. I can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than "just a place to crash" at the end of a long night.
