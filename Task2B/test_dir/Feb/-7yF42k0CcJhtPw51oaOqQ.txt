FOR THE SERENITY GARDEN ONLY!. . I loved this part of the Bellagio. I would have to say that this was the only publicly serene spot in all of the chaos of Las Vegas. It was definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Vegas. I got some really cool photos with my boyfriend and I remember the energy just feeling very flowing and tranquil within that area.
I frequent Vegas a lot and I have to say that Bellagio does have a very gorgeous lobby. But the rooms are extremely small, yet the bathrooms are big. Wasn't as impressed as I thought it would be. I was given an "upgrade" but I got a view of the back lot, and a still a small regular room. Not impressed. I thought this was supposed to be an upscale hotel.
Loved the stay!!!!! my room was right facing the music fountain and it was absolutely gorgeous! The hotel was very nice, the only thing i don't care for is the candy can sensors, you cannot move any of the cans unless you want to pay for it. For people who dont know about it or someone with kids, playing with the cans and not placing it back could cost you tons of money for something you didn't even consume. Other than that it was just great, if you dont like gambling, the bars are really nice for you to just relax and have a drink.
We stayed for three nights and were pleased with the room overall, but disappointed with the bathroom.  The door did not close completely, and there was only one outlet - which did not work 2 out of 3 nights.  The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and they have done some nice renovations on the rooms, but neglected to use the same care to update the bathrooms.  . . We likely will choose a different hotel on the Strip near the Bellagio on our next visit, but would consider staying there again if some changes are made to the rooms themselves.  The casino and restaurants are wonderful (Prime is the BEST steakhouse on the Strip!!), but the guest accommodations themselves need a little TLC.  Cheers!
One of the best rooms I've ever had! Beautiful, Clean and the view of the fountain and Paris were spectacular. . . The staff was kind and efficient in helping me make reservations. . . I'd have to say this room is a close second behind my stay at the Cosmopolitan. It just depends on your vibe. Do you want to feel like your in Oceans 11, listening to Sinatra, living in elegance. Or do you want something modern, upbeat and a little more zen. . . I tend to be a bit of an old soul and personally love the Sinatra vibes this place pumps out. . . One of my all time favorite restaurants is there. Todd English's Olives. I also enjoy Le Cirque and Circo. . . My boss who has traveled the world said his room was in his top 5, EVER. Now that's saying something. . . This place deserves 5 stars for it's impeccable service, elegant ambiance and fabulous restaurants.
Stayed in June 2013 and finally got around to writing this review. . . Overall the hotel is beautiful and the room is nice. The location is in the middle of the strip. There are many stores (Gucci, Hermes, etc) and many restaurants ranging from elegant dining to casual dining. The bars around the casino are always packed. The casino is huge and very packed as the day goes on. The casino also gets too stuffy due to smoking. So I enjoyed the casino early in the morning. . . The room is pretty standard (TV, desk, lamps, etc.). I love the bathroom. The bathroom has a standing shower and a hot tub. The shower has a little step/bench kind of thing. . . The decor of the lobby and the garden is beautiful. I love the miniature Washington monument and the enlarged sunflower statues. The bird house as the center piece is a great touch. I love it. . . The customer service I received was professional and courteous during my stay. At one point, I managed to leave the room without the key and I told the elevator security and he was able to call in for help. Within ten someone arrived at my room to let me in. The hotel is huge and the guy came quickly therefore I was impressed. . . The only reason they lost a star is because they couldn't give us the room i paid for. They have two towers (the main tower and a side tower). I paid extra to get a fountain view in the main tower but when I checked in they did not have a fountain view room in the main tower available. But they gave me a fountain view room in their side tower. The only negative thing I can say about their side tower is that the elevator to the tower is very far from the main entrance and the lobby and the casino of the hotel.. . The fountain shows are great. I love them. The water dances to the music. The night shows are much more beautiful (and much more comfortable to watch outside) to watch. . . Other than the room issue, everything was great and I enjoyed my stay there.
The fountain show at night is a must see!! It comes on once every fifteen minutes and it's quite a sight! . We sat across the street at mon ami gabi and had an amazing view!
Walked through this hotel multiple times when I was in Vegas.. . The interiors, decorations and architectures were really nice. The shopping areas looked okay, despite them being a bit pricey.. . The fountain shows were always fun to watch!
I stayed here years ago and it was amazing but on my last visit I only walked through.. . Bellagio is so beautiful. The fountain makes me feel like a kid again and the whole vibe of the place screams class.. . If I can ever splash out again on something like this I most definitely will.. . *Interesting fact: Our tour guide told us Vegas' most expensive wedding was atBellagio. Something like $30 MILLION, a couple from India who flew an elephant in. Wow!!!
The hotel is beautiful, the room is immaculate. Free internet. Friendly helpful staff come to our room twice a day. Valet is excellent. . . Two things to improve: more fresh air in room and the compression on the Video Monitor (TV) is sooooo bad everything looks like it was shot on 3/4" video tape from 1989. Movies like Die Hard look like garbage thanks to over compressed video.
I can't think of a single reason *not* to give Bellagio five stars, so here you go Bellagio, five stars for you.. . Check in process was very efficient.  The room was sleek and sumptuous.  The casino was lively and entertaining.. . The cab line can be a bit long and the wait for your taxi to get out on to the strip can be even longer.  One cab driver told me that of all the major hotels on the strip, only Bellagio does not have a back entrance, which tends to make things very slow going on Friday and Saturday night.  But unless you're super rushed, it's not really that big of a deal.. . I will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.
Jesus, I love the Bellagio and not only because I am a huge Ocean's Eleven fan.  Rooms are very spacious and splurge on fountain view rooms.  It's worth it.  . . Any of their buffets are decadent.  Although their dinner buffet is something I always look forward to when I am in Las Vegas.  Everything is delicious and there is seriously something for everyone.  . . I love Bellagio!
Always a pleasure to stay and visit at the Bellagio! Great scenery, beautiful flower gardens, great casino experience too! The restaurants are superb and my all time favorite is the Cafe Bellagio. Good food all day long for a reasonable price. Order the pancakes for breakfast and the ribeye steak for dinner!! The water fountain display is a must see and it's a great free show from your room or Las Vegas blvd!
I expected worse considering all of the 3 or below star reviews on this place.  I don't know if I agree with people who say this "isnt a real 5-star hotel" -- it's at least 4.5*'s in my book, and Im very particular about hotels.  The most important thing for me is the decor of the room -- most hotel rooms just have dark, dingy decor -- especially after staying at NYNY, MGM grand and Planet Hollywood, I know this for a fact.  That or the rooms are super outdated.  This was one of the prettiest hotel rooms Ive stayed in.  Nice and spacious, with beautiful modern deco decor.  I had a pool view which was gorgeous.  The room was clean and everything looked new, and there were robes in the room which is always nice.. . The people at the front desk were okay.  One guy was not personable at all but the girl I spoke with while checking out was better.  Nothing over the top though - Ive had better service at 4* hotels on that front.  . . My main complaint here was eating.  There arent a lot of choices. Im traveling alone and I dont want anything fancy, which is the class that most of the restaurants there fell into. A lot of stuff closes early too -- Jean Phillipe closed at 11pm here but at 12pm in Aria, which is weird.  The gelato place closed early too.. .  They also charge $10 for a bottle of fiji water from the mini bar which is just absolutely outrageous.. . The gardens are always gorgeous but I really loved their design for chinese new year.. . I've stayed in almost all of the 5 star hotels on the strip, and I would put this hotel right up there with rest.
I expected more.. . I had a premium fountain view room.  It was great to see the fountains when I wanted to.  But I had to hear them when I didn't until they ended at midnight.  It was akin to fireworks or a thunderstorm.  I paid extra for this noise?
Love staying at this hotel because of the atmosphere, the seasonally changing conservatory, middle location on the strip, and the nice rooms. I generally stay here about once or twice a year and my experiences have always been positive. Be sure to bring your camera if you plan on staying here because there are a lot of "picture-worthy" moments in the conservatory and there is even a cafe conveniently located nearby!
Love the Bellagio! Never disappoints.
