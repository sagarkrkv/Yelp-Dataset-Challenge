Huge lines but I strolled upto the bar like a boss and got a bar seat where they serve you food too.. . . Food was good but nothing to get excited about. I'll take Umami any day
The wait was long but worth it. I recommend getting the HOG BURGER...mother of all orgasmic mouth watering food. Server was awesome! Gave us the menu promptly and took our order in the next 10 minutes. Good service, bomb ass food
The line was very long but it was worth the wait. The service was good too. Our waiter was helpful and fast. . Love the restaurant's entrance with fire inside the glass. We had to take a picture in front of it. . The food was great, my favorite were the Truffle Parmesan Fries and I highly recommend them. We first started with the Jalapeno Popper Shots. I love spicy food but I don't know if it was cause I was drinking on a empty stomach or my Acid Reflux; but they were very spicy and gave me heartburn. I did enjoy the ranch sauce that you dip the poppers in, it was very yummy, refreshing, and helped with the heat of the popper. Next we got ours Burgers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The fries were so delicious. I love Parmesan cheeses and these fries were top with lots of it. I order the American Burger. It was very good but I wanted well done. Still good and juicy. . Overall I would highly recommend trying Gordon Ramsay BurGR and I will be coming back when I'm in Las Vegas.
Truffle Parmesan Fries: YUM! Loving the truffle mayo for the fries. . . Farm Burger: The runny egg really topped off the burger. Duck bacon...WHAT? Crazy but so good! . . Hell's Kitchen burger: It was okay nothing special but I do like how I ordered a medium rare patty and that is exactly what I got! Nothing overcooked, perfectly pink on the inside. . . . 1 star off for the wait (1 hour!). Also, my party of 10 got split up into two tables that weren't even next to each other but instead on opposite sides of the restaurant. This is something Gordon Ramsay would not be happy about.
Quite simply, the food at Burgr was absolutely amazing and I would even say that this was by far one of the best burgers I have ever had.  We had the Britannia burger, and the mango chutney it it was a great taste pleaser.  The garlic fries are also a fantastic side, and enough fries for 2 to share.  The atmosphere was quite pleasant, although the 35 minute wait to get in was frustrating.  It would be nice if they accepted reservations or gave the ability to book on open table. . . Now here is my negative why I took a star away.  The girls at the front desk could have not been more disinterested in their job if they tried.  When we went up to ask how long of a wait, it seemed like wewere doing nothing but bother their petty little discussion.   Not cool.  As for the waitress, she took quite a while to get our order, someone else brought it out, which I was appreciative of as I didn't want to wait all day, and lastly, once we were done, no waitress to be seen.  A bus boy cleaned our plates up and when I finally asked the hostess for our waitress to bring our bill, the manager ended up bringing it to us.  This didn't seem right.. . In short, go for the burgers as they are absolutely unreal, but flip a coin if you will get decent service or not.  Just don't be in a rush when you go!. . Enjoy!
Great food.  Restaurant is a little loud.  The staff was attentive and knowledgable about the food.  I enjoyed the farm burger and onion rings.  Definitely a must next time I'm back in Vegas.  If you're in the mood for a good burger, give this place a try.
I can't believe I stood in line for 45 minutes for this place.  There was fireeeee everywhere haha.  This is a great lunch place if you're in Vegas and not having craziness 24/7 on your agenda.. . B- : Hell's Kitchen burger - honestly, the ingredients were good but I didn't think it was ALL that.  The meat was fresh and juicy, perfectly cooked.  By the way, the burger just comes as is, no sides so you'll have to order the fries separately.. . A+ : Chanterelle Burger - my sister, Julie got this one, she's been on a crave for mushrooms these days.  Well I had a bite of it and this one was a winner.  The sweet onion jam made the burger, was a palate teaser! . . A: Truffle Parmesan Fries - carbs! YUM! I love the dipping mayo that came with it. . Overall, I was happy and would like to come back and try other burgers if I have the opportunity :)
My dinner at BurGR began a string of three new 5-star Las Vegas restaurant dining experiences in a row.  We began here with great hand-cut Truffle Parmesan Fries that resembled steak fries, and excellent Beer-Battered Maui Onion Rings with delicate splinters of Parmigiana-Reggiano Cheese adhering to the battered rings.  For dipping the O-Rings, we were supplied with a creamy Cheddar Ranch Dip and a very good requested Truffle Aioli.  We also received homemade Chipotle Ketchup, specially requested housemade regular Ketchup, and specially prepared requested Mild Yellow Mustard for my American Burger and Diane's Uber Cheese Burger.  I liked all of the sauces and condiments provided but still prefer Heinz Tomato Ketchup over all other varieties.  And, with all the choices at our disposal, I got mixed up switching between the two types of Ketchup on the table and recalling which was which. . . The beautifully seasoned and perfectly prepared burgers were flat-out outstanding!  Diane's Uber Cheese Burger featured a large and juicy medium-rare Uber Cheese Burger made with Fontina Cheese and Raclette Cheese (it also normally comes with Goat Cheese if desired), and my American Burger sported a delicious, amply-sized, and moist medium-rare burger with nicely melting American Cheese, Butter Lettuce, pickles, onions, and a small Heirloom Tomato.  Both burgers were sheltered in a nice soft Poppyseed & Sesame Seed Bun.  For good measure, Diane also enjoyed a thick and well-received Mixed Caramel Pudding & Chocolate Shake with Whipped Cream, that was accompanied by a Toffee Cookie.  This is a shake to be reckoned with!. . Service was friendly, professional, highly accommodating, and very efficient.  The only off note was that I had to get a new appetizer plate after finding a bit of food crud stuck on the one originally presented to me.. . While this is at heart a burger joint, it is a high-class one, with exemplary quality control.  For example, I observed an expediting chef inspecting each finished dish as it reached the pass before approving it for delivery to tables, just as Gordon Ramsay often does in "Hell's Kitchen."  You won't find this occurring in many establishments that feature hamburgers as their primary entree!. . We arrived at 10:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, and were seated about 5 minutes after our arrival.  Even though I've been told that the lines can be amazingly long on other days and times, that will not deter me from returning here again and again. . . The burgers are just that good!
Aside from the 45 minutes wait to be seated on a monday, i'd say our party had a great time. Food was pricey but that was expected going in. I can't wait to go back.
Gordon Ramsay has really made a name for himself, both in the TV world and in the culinary world. I love a good burger and made it a point to visit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on my most recent trip to Vegas. The restaurant is located within Planet Hollywood and is the first restaurant when entering Miracle Mile off of Vegas Boulevard. For a Monday afternoon there was a bit of a line, perhaps 15-20 people and you simply wait in line and aren't given a pager.. . After being seated, our friendly waiter came by to take our drink order and showed us an iPad with a selection ofspecialty cocktails. Early on I was tempted on ordering one of their massively-sized Devil Dawgs, but thought you can't come to BurGR and not get a burger. After asking our waiter for some personal suggestions, I opted for the honey-pig bao buns as our appetizer and the Euro burger, which he personally recommended. . . Considering how busy BurGR was, our drink order and appetizer came out rather quick. My +1 didn't indulge in the bao buns which meant more for me. The roasted pork belly was perfectly tender and the fresh cilantro and honey sauce made for one delicious appetizer. The bao buns dripped with roasted pork juice and their honey-hoisin sauce. . . After ravishing through the two bao buns, the Euro burger came out soon after. I can't stress enough that all their burgers look like masterpieces when served. The Euro burger looked almost too good to eat. The burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood and my burger had a truffle aioli, oven roasted tomato, arugula, and a mouth watering goat cheese that made all the difference. The cook on the medium rare patty was just right and the combination of flavors exploded through every bite. The artisan bun rounded out one of the best burgers I've tried.. . I have to admit I got a little sad as the meal came to an end. The burger was just right in every aspect. It wasn't a ginormous Vegas-sized burger, but more of a subtle and refined burger by the world-famous Gordon Ramsay. The burger is a little pricey at $15 especially since it doesn't come with any fries or sides. Nonetheless, you are in a Gordon Ramsay establishment and the man is serious about quality control. If you're a burger lover or like one of his many shows, Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a must try.. . . Ambiance/Decor: 4/5. Food: 5/5. Service: 4/5. Price: $$. Overall: 5/5. . Pros:. + Affordable Gordon Ramsay restaurant . + Specialty burgr menu. + Delicious burgers (Euro burger!). + Generous portions. + Friendly staff and service (cute waitresses). + Reasonable wait time. + Souvenirs for sale (glassware, books, etc.). . Cons:. - Wait time can vary on day/time. - No reservations
The Farm burger was really really good! Duck-breast bacon was AMAZING!. Service was quite good. Sweet potato fries with the Jalapeno aioli were great!. I had high expectations for my first experience with a Ramsay joint and I can honestly say it did not disappoint!. Check it out!
Been wanting to check this place out for awhile. Everytime i walk by it's busy.....well, tried it tonight with a good friend of mine. Place was busy. Hostesses were pleasant, we were greeted within a minute with cassie our waitress who was great. I liked the ipad presentation and menu. Nice touch. Both of us had the cheeseburgers. Mine was probably the best burger that i can remember. Fries were also good. Not a big fan of the chipolte ketchup or the curry ketchup. When i asked for regular ketchup, theres had a little bitter taste to it.....but that was minor when talking about the overall experience. I definately will be bringing my friends back here.....
It's loud, sporty, flamey, and orange.  A lot of commotion in the kitchen, but it's all good.  They have an full-time expediter, and someone dedicated just to make sure the presentation is perfect.  I had the birds-eye view from the back counter.  There wasn't anybody shouting (Gordon wasn't here).  It was a well-oiled machine.. . Everything sounds and looks amazing.  Everything.  I wanted to try it all (and I will be going back many times until I do).  Roasted Jalapeno Poppers (made fresh, and individually served as 6 in a small glass of fiery dip), Five Spice Chicken Sliders, Fury Chicken Wings, all the burgers including the Hog (a pork burger), Fish & Chip Sandwich, Truffle Parm Fries, Shakes, and I could go on and on.  Mouth watering.  Shallow perhaps, but the place makes me happy. . I had to try one of their incredible "dawgs", along with a burger, and the onion rings.  Each was more reasonably priced than I expected.. . Chanterelle Burger ($16) -- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam.  Perfect size, my guess 5 oz.  I suppose it's a simple burger, but it was darn near amazing -- almost made my eyes roll back.  Top 10 burger, for sure, on my "Berger Knows: Burgers" list.  Seeded bun, delish.. . Onion Rings ($9) - huge.  The breading is very light, has parm splash atop.  Well-seasoned, it had a meat like flavor.  Wonderful.. . Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg ($13) - ginormous.  Seeded hot dog bun was fantastic, and dog was top quality, 3 times the size of a normal one.  A bit salty, but the toppings were worthy....and firey hot.. . Presentation - 5.0. Flavors - 4.75. Service - 4.75. Speed - 4.0. Ambiance - 4.5. . The servers, all attractive, wear short blue or gray skirts with matching top.  Guys, snug fitting shirts with jeans.  Very nice service, very competent kids.. . Rounded up, it was a near perfect dining experience and I so want to go back.  Fun, delicious, and had that "wow" factor.
Not sure what the rave is about. My Hell's Kitchen burger (medium rare) was fine but nothing amazing or even memorable. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However the jalapeno poppers were great.. the sauce is perfectly creamy and highly addictive! I was secretly hoping I would get the spicy popper but no such luck. The wait was an hour long but the hostess let us put our name down and walk around until our table was ready, which was really appreciated. Although the burger was a bit disappointing, I might just be back for those poppers.
A burger joint that GR himself would approve of. Get it...GR? (BurGR). . Anyway, service was 5-star quality, atmosphere was really nice, and the food was totally worth the price, which ended up being like $25 for sharing three sides + burger with four people. . . Jalapeno poppers are a must get. Fries are onion rings are strong as well. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was RAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. . . Jk. It was very delicious, tender, and perfectly medium rare. A prime burger. . . Would love to try a shake but it's $9 :(. . . I will be back.
The service is awesome. If your looking for a food-gasm you came to the right place!! #sogood
Two weeks ago, I went for the first time. Got the farm burger and shake #4 (creme brulee and Oreo milkshake). They were excellent! . . Tonight, got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Nice heat, but my burger was charred on one side so all I could taste was the char. I asked for medium well and they gave me almost rare. My friend ordered medium rare and she got rare. Service was slow, but our waitress was nice. It was hard to get a hold of her though. . . I let our waitress know about my burger and she kindly took the cost off the total. She re-ordered my friend's burger and half of it came our medium rare and the other half looked rare. What's going on, chef?. . Tips:. -located inside Planet Hollywood's casino. . -Don't jump in line. Walk past the line and check in with the hostess. They will text you when your table is ready. . -Plan for at least at 30 minute wait on weekdays and 1 hour on weekend nights. Always a wait!. -order the farm burger. Best one there. Hell's Kitchen burger was ok. Uber burger is good too, but farm burger is the best. . -Parmesan truffle fries are ok to good. But truffle isn't my favorite thing. . -service is slow. I checked in at 6:30pm on Friday night, got seated at 7:15pm, got our burgers at 8pm, got my tab at 8:50pm. I had a show at 9pm and flagging our waitress down was near impossible. . -Have your Total Rewards membership number to get one dollar off each item (located on your membership card, emails, or account login online). . . Been here twice, but will only go here again if my friends really wanted me to go.
Went on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 minutes, but totally worth it! The menu was varied and had a lot of interesting choices. The servers were excellent and very friendly and I have to say both burgers we ordered were very good. The buns were excellent and the meat was cooked to perfection. If I had to put a negative it would be the physical location of the restaurant, it seemed kind of squished into the Planet Hollywood and was a bit noisy. Nonetheless we would definitely be back and we enjoyed our experience tremendously! Highly recommend
The burger was great! I got one with duck topping and it really popped! Stick with the sweet potato fries over any other type though.
A great place overall -- service is super friendly and quick, the drinks are great, and the food is amazing. To find a delicious, well-priced restaurant in Vegas is saying something, so this place is a must-try. The decor is pretty astounding, and by decor I mean the wall logo that is on fire.. . I got the Farm Burger and it was cooked perfectly, and so big that I could barely finish it. After watching so many GR shows, it was a treat to get to eat at one of his restaurants. I will definitely be back!
I had the HOG BURGER, which we were told by our server comes out very pink but that it was ok even though there is pork in the meat. . Got the burgers, they were, OK at best. Not worth the money at all but no big deal. . The big deal came early the next morning when I awoke with food poisoning. I had to cut my Vegas trip short by 2 days because I was so sick. . Pretty pissed off. I wasted a lot of money, missed the concert I was there for, and threw my guts up for a burger that wasn't even very good. I won't go back,
I won't forget the fish sandwich I had here. I will dream about it all the way here in California.. . It was a giant piece of battered cod nestled into a toasty bread, hotdog-like bun. I wish hot dogs came in the buns that they used here because they were awesome! Can;t forget to mention that sprinkled on top are these thin little salt and vinegar crisps. The whole thing was so good I gobbled it up. I almost never finish a whole plate of food, especially something this big, but it was well worth the food baby I walked out with.. . I love that they had 2 options for root beer. It seemed that nowhere else in all of Planet Hollywood had any. When you can;t drink caffeine but want a good soda, Sprite (and Sprite-like options) can get kind of boring....and I just really like root beer.. . The staff here was really friendly and you are presented with a customer service survey along with your bill. . . The athletic attire for the women was kind of weird to me, but I guess it fits in with the sports on the tv. The men had to wear these flannel shirts with jeans that had a big "GR" with flames on one of the butt pockets. I was kind of amused that the guys were sporting Ramsay's initials on their butts.
This place is the bomb!  The service is excellent!  The food is delicious!  And the prices are reasonable.  We got the Euro Burger, the fish sandwich, the sliders, and Truffle french fries.  We were too full to get any shakes, but they looked amazing!  Definitely a must try if you're in the neighborhood.
I'm a big fan of Ramsay, his persona and his cooking.  BurGR seemed like a cool place in concept, look and feel and with so many rave reviews, the expectations were probably tough to match.  Look for an updated review in the near future but my first experience at least in tastebuds has been 'okay'.  . . When you get there, you're usually first greeted by a massive line if you're coming in during the peak rush hours.  Luckily, that line moves by pretty quick and the hostesses usually come around looking for specific party numbers to get everyone moving.  I got to sit in the counter area where the action was happening.  The decor was pretty cool as well with a fiery front piece and the staff were nice enough.  . . They have a nice drink menu on an iPad (curious if these iPads are on the tables as we had to ask for the iPad at the counter) and a good selection.  The menu itself consists of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and some desserts.  I debated between the farm burger and the Chanterelle burger and ended up with the farm since so many Yelpers were happy with it.  I also got some regular fries and an ale on draft.  . . The fries were pretty good - full potato slices so they were pretty thick with curry and a slightly spicy ketchup sauce.  It reminded me of Umami although the sauces perhaps lacked a little more fire than others who have tried a similar menu deal.  The burger looked pretty fascinating - a nicely cooked patty, duck bacon, a fried egg on a sesame seed bun.  The duck bacon was excellent in itself and the fried egg was a nice complement.  Perhaps I felt the burger lacked a certain kick of flavor along with the fairly dry bun.  The burger felt like it should have melted in my mouth but only the bacon/fried egg did.  Unfortunately, the end result was a so-so taste experience.   . . It isn't to say the restaurant is bad persay - I just believe that the burger I had was a bit overhyped for what I was finally expecting.  It's definitely a cool joint that is worth checking out for burger fans and shouldn't completely destroy your wallet.  I just think I'll give it one more try and look for another burger with a bit more oomph in taste.  . .

I was really excited to try Gordon Ramsay BurGR since I wanted to see what the fuss was about after watching him on Hell's Kitchen.  I was definitely not disappointed!  . . We ordered:. * five spice chicken sliders - it was mixed reviews - half of us liked it and half thought it was only okay.  The chicken was not dry and had a good crispy texture, but the five spice flavor was very strong.  . *honey-pig bao bun - delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS!  Not super sweet but all the condiments went together very well. . *earth burger - I love meat patties, but this Portobello mushroom patty can really convert me!  it was so packed with flavor and was juicy to the bite.  I would definitely get this burger again!. . * farm burger - the patty was cooked to what was ordered and the egg, duck bacon, everything worked well together. . * truffle parmesan fries - a little salty, but the garlic, parmesan, and truffle work well together . . *shake #5: chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie - this was my FAVORITE from a great meal.  It was everything I was hoping it would be - sweet, but yummy coffee flavor and complimented the meal.  We passed this around the table and everyone agreed it was a favorite.. . * sticky toffee pudding push up pop - I was a little disappointed with this since I have been waiting to try the famous sticky toffee pudding Gordon Ramsay is known for, but if the little bit that was in this push-pop is what it tastes like, I think I can pass on it.  There wasn't any specific thing that was bad about this it just wasn't terrific.  After the shake, this was just a little of a let down.. . Overall, I would definitely come back if I am ever wanting a good burger and great milk shake.  They don't take reservations, so be ready to wait.  There were five of us and we waited 45 minutes - this was on a Saturday night at 6PM
I would give this  3.5 stars if I could.  . . Atmosphere - It was nice and gave it a little fun tone to it.. . Food - I got the farm burger which was decent.  The patty was a little salty so I was  little disappointed.  The truffle fries were AMAZZZING!! . . Service - Our waiter was attentive and had great suggestions on the menu.. . Maybe I had high hopes for the burger and I'm being a bit harsh but I'll be back to give   a second try in case it was a bad night for patties.
Food: Euro Burgr- Delish! Though I wish I had ordered it cooked medium vs medium-well.  (I feel the flavor of the meat was muted because of this).  Goat cheese  and arugula is ALWAYS a good idea.. . Parmesan truffle fries were SO good! get them!. . The atmosphere was on point.  From the service, menus, and even the silverware (yes, the silverware!) we were definitely in for an experience.
I bad the farm burger with the egg over easy... it was so good.... and the duck breast bacon on tgere was to die for!!!!
Great service, great food, amazing atmosphere! Make sure you have the sweet potato fries with powdered sugar!
We wouldn't go back! The food was overly priced and not very good at all! We ordered the hog burger and the fish sandwich fries and onion rings with 2 beers and it was 75 dollars! Ridiculous! Unless u have a fancy palate don't go here go to steak by Gordon Ramsey and get a good meal. The stars were for the waitress she was great
Delightful experience.  Alex ( with glasses) was tremendous, making recommendations that made our dinner experience better than we hoped.
The GR on the end of the name is a nice touch and it would be appropriate to use the letters to describe the food.....GReat! The decor is really well thought out right down to the silverware. The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic! Yeah its a BurGR. but the explosions in your mouth of all the great flavors combined set a new standard. We had the onion rings, parmesan truffle fries and we shared 2 of his signature BurGRs. As for the wait, it was not bad at all. You sign in, they text you when its your time to be seated and you drop a few bucks in the casino, No worries! Another WOW for a truly talented and motivated individual. Chef Ramsay thank you for your artistry!!
Check-in was quick (for 2) we sat down and order in less than 5 mins, but it took 40mins to get our food, I had the Uber Cheese Burger and damn it was juicy, also had the Regular fries and the curry ketchup had me liking my fingers so good!. This place is great, the food is good but the wait is long.
I shared a Farm Burger, Parmesan Truffle fries and the sticky toffee pudding push pops with my husband for our Valentine's Day lunch. The Farm Burger has duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese and a fried egg on a brioche bun. We ordered it medium but it was more like a medium rare burger but it was delicious regardless and we loved it. The Parmesan Truffle Fries were very good and came with an aioli sauce that was very tasty.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding push pops because we thought it would be more like the sticky toffee pudding at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse at Paris next to Planet Hollywood but it wasn't.  The sticky toffee pudding at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse is one of the best desserts I've ever had.  This dessert at Burgr was just ok for me. It was like a brownie ice cream push pop and was a little too sweet for me. Kids might like it!  Service was good and our overall dining experience was excellent. If you sign up for a free Total Rewards players card at Planet Hollywood you can get $1 off each dish and if you have enough points you can use it to pay for your meal. The Farm Burger was $14, Parmesan Truffle Fries $10 and Sticky Toffee Push Pops $6 (prices with a Total Rewards card).  I would recommend this place and will be dining here again.
Well,  I was  ready for a superior burger at BurGR. I'm a huge Gordon Ramsey fan and was sure I would be writing a great review. Not so!  Old Gordon dropped his standards.  The burger was not flavorful and the truffle fries were undercooked and greasy. . . Probably better than the one rating,  but this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant so the expectations were high. Go to BLT instead. . . Gordon - I know you're making a lot of money and building a brand,  but you need to keep the standards high.  If you don't change things,  you may find BurGR on kitchen nightmares.
My family and I are HUGE fans of Gordon Ramsey. We went to Vegas last month and decided we had to try Burgr. When we got there there was a 1 1/2 hr wait. However, they took our cell phone # and said they would text us when it was time. PERFECT! We didn't have to wait around. We walked over to the Bellagio and then did some shopping near Planet Hollywood. Soon enough our text came in and we went back to Burgr. This was hands down the BEST burger I've ever had. I've been on a quest for a great burger and I was not disappointed. We got fries and onion rings to split and the onion rings were really good. However, the burger is so filling that we could have skipped that. I got a burger with foggy onion jam and my husband and oldest daughter got duck breast bacon on their burgers. My youngest daughter likes a very plain burger but with ketchup. She said she didn't even need ketchup because her burger was so good. They were all just so delicious! The only thing that would have made this place better were if Chef Ramsey were there!
The food was pretty good and the service was really good. It's interesting using the iPad to look at their menu haha and the sweet potato fries are really good too!
Only reason for the 4 stars & not 5 is the wait is crazy long!  But I'll tell you it's worth the wait!  It's to be expected to wait a long time anywhere worth eating at in Vegas. As a local I'd rather stay away from the strip but I'd brave the tourists & crowds any day for this place!!  The food we had was amazingly delightful!  The shake we had at the end was out of this world!  It was a creamy goodness that I had never experienced before. I was left wondering how they achieved it.  Even if you're stuffed get one just to see what I'm talking about. It'll blow your mind ;)
This place is incredible!. We had the pork bun app and split it and it was so flavorful and tasty. then we split the Euro Burger and my husband said it was the best burger he had ever had and he eats out all the time. For desert the Sticky Toffee Pops they were fun to have a gourmet push up with toffee, brownie and ice cream. We walked away stuffed and happy!
Wait was not as long as expected (around25 mins) and they even send texts to your phone as your table is ready, a very nice opportunity to walk around rather than wasting time standing in a line. . . I ordered the Chanterelle burger, Truffle Parmesan fries, and a chocolate shake. The burger was fantastic, one of the best I've ever had. The fries were good as well but a bit strong for my taste. They were good due to the refreshing experience the fries offered; never before have I tasted anything like it. The shake was top notch as well. The bill holder is fitted with an iPod touch so customers can conveniently leave their remarks. . . The table I sat at seemed a bit close to other patrons on both sides of me, sort of like a speed dating row of tables. But I didn't find it uncomfortable. It sometimes gave my party a chance to recommend a good dish to someone just being seated. I'm sure it could also work vice versa. . . I had a wonderful experience at BurGR. Couldn't recommend it any more.
Excellent service! I never had to ask for a drink refill, my waitress sensed when I was almost done with my and refilled. . My friend and I decided to share the hog burger and the farm burger. The taste of the farm burger was fabulous! The combination of the egg with the duck bacon created a festival of flavors in my mouth! On the opposite side, the hog burger was more subtle in flavor but the apple butter gave it a nice sweet subtle flavor. I enjoyed both and highly recommend them.
As I was walking into Planet Hollywood I noticed a long line at Gordon Ramsay Burger and thought noway am I waiting in that line for a burger. The line wait was 45 minutes long but THE BAR was EMPTY. So I ask the host if its okay if we sit there and she said yes. I got the same food as everyone waiting in line with much better service. The bartender/waiter was great. . . I had the Farm Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries and my girlfriend had the Hells Kitchen Burger with Beer Battered Onion Rings. We also had some cocktails that the bartender made to perfection (with lots of alcohol ;) . Everything about our visit to Gordon Ramsay Burger was phenomenal. Food and service were both great.. . Next time your in Vegas and want a good burger, this is the place to go! Just remember to look for seating at the bar if you don't have the patience to wait in line for over 30 minutes. 5 star for sure, best burgers I've ever tasted.
Being vegan, me and my wife ordered Earth Burger (veggie) and to be honest this was the worst burger we have ever eaten. $15 for such a crap. On top of that they won't even serve you any sides. Serving size is also small. I am not going to this place again ever !. . If you want some really awesome burger, try Veggie Burger in Grand Luxe Cafe in Venetian or Palazzo. You will love it.
Burgers are awesome....perfectly cooked to your preference. Fish and crisps also a must try. Simple, with high quality ingredients and perfectly executed! Often more than 40mn wait. Just ask to sit at the bar. Always some room there and you will enjoy prime view on a well orchestrated kitchen.
Best Classic burger Ive ever had!!  I'm a huge in n out fan, and search the world for the best gourmet burgers.  This was hands down AMAZING. -Juicy, perfect amount of cheese and seasoning.  I loved Gordon already, but he knows his BurGR!
TASTY! We randomly decided to go here for late lunch the beginning of the month on a little Vegas getaway with my honey.. .  Made it to Planet Hollywood to find a pretty long line.... We decided to wait it out, and we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes or so which was not terrible. I had the Euro Burger had a number of different flavors which went very well together. My other half had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I had a bite it was ok.. I was expecting more spice and more intense flavors but it was tasty. The burger patty was seasoned well and of course cooked perfectly to our taste of medium, but In all honesty (i am a true carb lover) the best part of the burger was the bun. We also ordered onion rings and parmesan and truffle french fries. The onion rings were delicious, definitely freshly fried. On top of food we added one drink each and after all of that let me tell you we were very full. We expected a huge bill but it was right around $70 which was not terrible at all considering we had drinks and were leaving absolutely stuffed. . . Service was great!
Honestly, one of the best burger restaurants ever. The line is typically long, but my family and I were able to rush over before the Britney Spears concert let out. Even if we had to wait an hour or so, it would be well worth it.. . The restaurant is hip and fun with great staff. There is a lot of attention to details, many of which are "hidden" unless you look more closely; i.e., the spiral elements along the ceiling replicate cow bones. BurGR is what you would expect to find in a Planet Hollywood and the designer did a great job creating a great casual atmosphere.. . Ramsey's menu is incredible. Not only did he obviously focus on burgers, but other fare for all to enjoy. You have a lot of burger choices which is the real reason to visit of course, They are all fantastic with the freshest ingredients and the best buns ever. Just don't miss out on the Truffle Parmesan Fries (you can share an order of these because they are huge).
Really good place to go and eat.  A little pricey but it's worth it.  Service is amazing.
This place is overrated. I have been here twice to eat dinner with few friends and the flavors are honestly whatever. I would much rather have In & Out over this place.. . Burgers I have tried:. Hell's Kitchen Burger - little bit of kick to it but nothing to write home about. . American Burger - just a standard burger that costs $13 dollars. I could have grilled something like this in my backyard.. . Sides: Truffle Parmesan Fries - these are below average truffle fries. I've had good truffle fries and these have a very very light truffle flavoring. Not Good. The dipping sauce is good.. . Just Fries - these are standard french fries. Can't go wrong with this.. . There are much better Burger places in L.A. that are half the cost then this place. Holstein's at Cosmo is much better.
Really good burger. In buffet heaven, 35 dollars for burger/appetizer/drink can be a tough sell. I tried it, and it was better than average but you can get better value at some other places around town.. . The decor was really nice. The burger itself was very tasty. The jalapeno poppers were good, but a tad expensive I would say considering there are burgers for about the same price. The place is jammed packed, so they certainly are not missing out on any business, they have a prime location.
I live in the Las Vegas area and have dined here twice since I moved here 5 months ago. The first time I ate here was in December of 2013. Immediately after we were sat, our server (I don't recall his name because it has been a couple months, but he reminded me of Aladdin) went over the iPad drink menu with us and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable of each specialty drink, wine, and beer selection. He didn't just know the basics, he knew every intricate detail that went into making that cocktail, the process the went into giving each wine its distinct flavor, and was able to describe all the intricacies that went into brewing each particular beer. During his descriptions, he walked us through how to navigate the iPad drink menu as well, which I'm sure is extremely beneficial to any folk that might not be familiar with Apple products. . . He was also an expert on the food menu items as well and was able to guide us and provide recommendations that best suited each of us. I ended up trying the Hell's Kitchen Burger and split orders of Sweet Potato Fries and Truffle Parmesan Fries with my friends. Since the burgers themselves don't come with fries, you have to order the fries separately as if they were an appetizer. Since the fries didn't come with the burger, I expected them to come out earlier before the burger was brought out, however, they arrived at the same time of the burgers and we had to wait a couple extra minutes for the last side of Sweet Potato fries to show up. Other than that, the food was absolutely PHENOMENAL!! The Truffle Parmesan Fries were outstanding and the dipping sauce complimented the flavor of the fries. The Sweet Potato Fries were BY FAR my favorite, definitely the best fries I have ever tried in my life. They some with powdered sugar to sprinkle on the fries. I'm no chef and I certainly would never have thought to pair sweet potato fries with powdered sugar, but it was delicious! The Hell's Kitchen Burger did not disappoint either. Everything was cooked to perfection. . . Overall, our experience at BurGr was fantastic! From our server, to the cooks, to the friendly and helpful busser, Kelly, BurGr definitely lives up to the service expectations out in Las Vegas. The fire fixture ties in well with the ambiance and is definitely eye-catching for anyone passing through the casino.
If you want a great service and food experience on a modest budget, BurGR is a great way to explore the Gordon Ramsay style of service and cooking without breaking the bank.  You get the knowledgeable servers and great tasting food (although, in the end, it is still a burger, which no matter how well you do it doesn't compare to, say, Wagyu or Kobe beef filets).  We came in mid week at 7pm and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated.  It's not a restaurant for privacy, no, but overall an excellentexperience.
I told Jacqueline R.  that I would go try this place.  And I finally did!. . To clarify, this one is not the Gordon Ramsey burger joint over at Planet Hollywood with 20 different choices.  This one only has four burger/ sandwiches in the category.  We were confused after 45 minutes of walk on the strip.  Tired, hungry... And found out that the place was fully booked for the night and the receptionist had stopped taking reservations!  She saw the devastation on our faces and immediately said, "you can always sit at the bar!"  So we did.. . Interior design-- spacious, modern, British simplicity and elegance.. There are about 200 Beer kegs on one side of the wall indicating a wide selection of brews available at the bar.. . Staff-- cool, friendly, knowledgable.. I couldn't help asking about the uniform-- black & white short sleeve collared jersey with printed houndstooth design, skinny jeans in pumpkin spice color.  It takes some guts to put on these very bold outfit everyday, guys!  Well, they hate it.  But the irrelevant colors attract attention for sure.  . . Well, I took the bartender's recommendation and ordered the lamb burger.  This item was AMAZING.. . The bun was unbelievably soft.  The goat cheese and lamb dissolved on my tongue and went down like a fast train.  I usually hesitate with the combo of lamb and goat cheese because the smell could be easily overwhelming.  The ingredient used here were apparently superior.  There was no scent of lamb or goat for my anxiety.  A very successful dish!  And I loved the fries too.. . Drink-- "Goodbye Blue Sky". Champaign, berry juice, vodka, 2 big blue berries on top with a twist of orange peel.  Bubbly and fruity,  it was delightful.. . I'm glad I came here.  I would definitely come back!
If Gordon Ramsay actually went to this place anonymously he would probably fire half of the staff.  If you're going to come up with a boring concept like "burger" and take out a vowel to make it sound cool then your food and your service better. be pretty f'in good.  This place fails on so many levels and you could probably just start with the uniforms.  Just based on the uniforms I feel like whoever came up with the concept thought this place would be like a high end version of Hooters where all of the waitresses would be dressed in skin tight dresses that focus diners' attention away from the food they're eating.  That isn't a good sign if you're expecting something representative of the Gordon Ramsay stamp of culinary excellence.  After waiting for an hour or so to be seated we waited a fair amount of time to place an order and then waited another fairly long time to receive the food.  I would say from being seated to receiving food it took over 30 minutes, which for burgers and fries is completely absurd.  The $9 Oreo milkshake with creme brulee pudding was of quality somewhere between Burger King and a nice local shake joint.  I've had far better $9 shakes so while it was good there was nothing special about it to make it a $9 shake.  At our table we ordered a euro, 2 Hell's kitchen, an uber cheeseburger, and some Parmesan truffle fries.  There is no kids menu which is to be expected in vegas but even at Pub 1842 they threw together a huge basket of chicken tenders and fries for $9 as a kids item!!  My table mates thought the burgers were pretty good.  Maybe I was irritable from waiting so long but the burger I had the day before at Pub 1842 was any times superior to the hell's kitchen.  The uber was ordered medium well and came out medium rare.  unless they are using all grass fed beef I don't see why it could be so hard to cook the red out.  the fries were ok.  again, nothing too memorable about these fries.  you could see baskets and baskets of them sitting under a heat lamp waiting for their counterparts and I don't think that's how a high end place should operate.  when you're paying $25+ for a burger and fries it had better be the most epic burger you've ever had.  I've had many impressive $16-$20 burgers living in park city so I can definitively say this restaurant is a gimmicky waste of time capitalizing only on Gordon Ramsey's fame and needs to go back and work on the basics.  try Michael Mina's pub 1842 instead, similar prices, much better value and food execution...
I have been here 4 times, and have loved it every single time. Except this time... The bald Asian General Manager is no longer there and the place has gone down hill since then. Our food took over 30 minutes to get to us, not to mention our food was cold..! 3 tables that ordered their food after us, finished their food and left before we even received our food. The "new" GM apologized for our extensive ticket time and wished us a tasty meal. The food itself was good, but don't tell me it'll be out in 15 min when it's going to take 45-50 minutes. The management needs some attentions ASAP!!!!!!!! Get the big Asian back in the house because the short Caucasian guy with the glasses isn't cutting it. He didn't make a good experience for my friends bday weekend/ first time dining there... PS: the waitress Cali is awesome, request her if you can
We came here pretty late at night on a Sunday and got seated within 10-15 minutes. My husband and I decided on the Fish Sandwich and regular fries to share (I know...ordering a Fish Sandwich at a Burger Joint..but we are both super picky about burgers). Well, lucky for us after one bite, we both proclaimed BEST. FISH. SANDWICH we have ever had!!! So for you pescatarians out there, you will be in heaven. . . The fish is fresh, buttery and crisp, the bun is nicely toasted, the crunchy salted vinegar chips on top add wonderful texture and the tartar sauce is creamy with a nice lemony zing. I thought the fries were decent too, my husband liked the smokey tomatoey ketchup they came with. We decided to come back the next day and order the same thing for lunch - but as most sequels - it did not taste AS wonderful as the first.
We split the chanterelle mushroom burger with truffle fries. The fries are insanely good. The burger was awesome...totally worth the price.  Their specialty cocktail drinks are actually worth the $12 pricetag as they deliver on flavor and punch.. . Would definitely return even though service was a little slow because they said the kitchen was backed up. Not a problem...take your time....produce good food and it's worth the wait!
The place is good with beautiful waitresses and the food is amazing! The cocktails were good too especially the slimy screw...wow! Must go for the cute waitresses at least ;-)
Fantastic. I had the parmesan truffle fries, which are a must. Normally I don't like onion rings, but I could eat their onion rings for days. The duck bacon burger was amazing even when I heated up the leftovers the next day. I will definitely be coming back.
We came here tonight looking forward to an amazing burger. On a scale of one to ten I give my burger a six.  The food took forever to come out, and I mean a LONG TIME, when it did come out the fried egg on my burger was cold and the yolk was hard, the meat was salty and so so.  My wife actually left over half her patty.  The truffle fries were incredible.  The sweet potato fries were tasty but also cold.  Overall for the money a major disappointment. We waited.  45 minutes for a table and then almost an hour for our food. We will NOT visit this place again, there are too many other burger houses in town that truly serve a real good burger.  GR BURGR isn't one of them
Delicious burger. Loved the truffle parmesan fries. Service was slow and the kitchen was backed up (ie empty drinks and 30 minutes for a burger).
WOOOOOOW . . UMMMMMMM... did I already say WOOOOOW??. . We waited about 25-30 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon/evening/ My group ordered Jalapeno Poppers, and I ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger for myself. . . The Jalapeno Poppers- I can't really say it was good or bad although the sauce was really delicious. Out of the 6 poppers, I got the "special" one, which turned out to be EXTREMELY SPICY!!! OH CRAP. I never got to taste a regular one so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like.. . . Hell's Kitchen Burger-  my mouth was still burning from the special popper, and I don't normally eat spicy food, but I really wanted to try Hell's Kitchen burger, which is supposed to be somewhat spicy. so I asked our attentive and energetic waiter to put less jalapenos in my burger. The burger still tasted amazing even with less jalapenos. I was a little worried if it was going to be bland, but it wasn't! Oh, how I wished I could finish the burger...I only ate half of it and forgot about the other half and left it in my suite for 2 days! I had to throw it away of course.... I wanted to cry. :'( . . I must come back here...
Gordon Ramsay, . . HAVE YOU EVEN VISITED YOUR OWN RESTAURANT? Stop with the kitchen nightmares and improve this place first! . . As a huge MasterChef fan, I was really hoping BurGR would live up to its hype, but really everything is sooooo average and overpriced to boot. The patty is pretty tasteless with a weird texture, which is surprising given that I asked for it medium rare and it's supposed to be cooked over some smoky apple wood or something else exotic. Pretty sure all of the 5 stars are from people who have had one too many fat tuesdays (which is also in pH and a wayy better bang for your buck) . . On the plus side, great service and cool menu design! The fries were pretty good and +1 HUGE star for the aioli that it came with.
Got the American burger. Hubs got uber cheese burger. We thought meat was superior to burger we had a couple of nights before at B&B in Venice. Meat was tender and juicy but did not drip. Fries are hand cut. I rather prefer the shoe string fries but at least with hand cut you know they are fresh and they tasted fresh with nice toppings. . We were too full to get an appetizer or milkshake but they looked wonderful. We would go back.
I was dying to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  So naturally when I saw the flaming sign from across the casino, I had to jump at the chance!. . My friend and I decided to come here around 11pm after the Britney Spears 'Piece of Me' concert.  It was packed.  35 minute wait for a table.  Wow.  Must be delicious!. . After we are seated, we become familiar with the menu and quickly made our selections.  The process of ordering a drink is rather odd and inconvenient.  The waiter brings over an iPad and scrolls through every drink, explaining what it is in and then leaves you with it to make your selection.  When he returns, he ignores what was put into the iPad and just asks what we want to drink and writes it down.... . He made some recommendations for the burGRs and we placed our order.. . .....Bueller?  Bueller?  I mean... Waiter?  Waiter?  Where is the food?. Unfortunately the wait for our two burGRs was over a half hour.  They must be butchering my cow to order out there... geesh.. . The food however, was delicious and cooked to perfection.  This place would EASILY earn 5 stars from me if the service was just a tad bit better.  Servers need to be a bit more attentive, I noticed the same aggravation at the tables around me.. . As much as I enjoyed my burGR - I don't know that I'd choose to make a 1.5hr ordeal for it.
I am giving this place 5 stars because I am the person that says, "there's only so much you can do with a hamburger" but this place proved me wrong.  I have always seen the "fried egg" on a burger option but never thought it sounded too good.  Being here though, I wanted to try something new and ordered it.  Wholly Cow!  (pun intended)  It was an amazing hamburger.  I can't wait to go back.  None of use were real thrilled with the fries but we did finish off our first round of onion rings and asked for a second order before we were done.  Our waiter was friendly and we couldn't have asked for better service.  They had a line but we just gave them my mobile number and they text me just before our table was ready so we were able to go up to the room real quick before dinner.  Everyone at my table was loving dinner that night.
Spent $140.00 including tip on 4 burgers, 1order fries ( shared by whole family), 1beer, 2 shakes, and 1appetizer(fried, stuffed jalepenos were totally room temperature).... better places to get burgers....I'd recommend BJ's instead...several locations in Vegas where u can pay $11 instead of $18, on a waaaay better burger...service was great though
Hungry and winning in Las Vegas, I knew I had to find food. After seeing a fellow yelper's review about this place (Hi Jacqueline R), I knew I had to try it out but I didn't expect to be in love!!! Located inside Planet Hollywood, we walked in to find a long line standing next to the restaurants name in flames of fire! Exciting!!! We waited a few minutes before being seated. The place has a nice feel to it without being too overwhelming. It's very modern and spacious. It gets even more modern once you get to place your order, which is placed thanks to an Ipad.. yes you read that right, on an Ipad!! So cool. . . Our waiter came over and gave us a brief rundown on highlighted menu items. While scrolling through the menu we decided we would share our meal.. . We ordered:. *Truffle Parmesan Fries $11- HIGHLY recommended! Crisp, tasty, not oily at all. The truffle salt and parmesan, the amazing taste of these fries truly blew me away.  Outstanding! Some of the best fries ever! And for sure hard to share since I totally wanted to eat the whole thing myself. I love that the cheese was evenly spread out through out the whole cone of fries, which allowed us to get our fair share of cheese with each bite. The dipping sauce/truffle aioli was also pretty tasty.   (10/10). . *Euro Burger $16- Juicy meat, warm soft delicious bread bun, truffle aioli running down my fingers making me lick the goodness off, some goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and arugula for some greens. Goodness gracious! The quality of this burger is so worth the dollars I spent to get to this burger bliss. The burger was a decent size, I would have been wayyyy full if I ate it all myself but we were pretty satisfied with the portion and decided to leave some room in for more alcohol.  (10/10). . *Green tea gin- STRONG flavor of gin in this drink indeed! Had a good buzz going on thanks to this baby. The green tea flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.   (9/10). . We were gonna try a shake or the interesting push pops that we saw some people sharing from across our table but they said it wasn't anything too special or highly recommended so we decided to skip out on dessert. . . There is a professional photographer that comes around and takes pictures of you during your meal which made me feel like a celebrity haha. We decided to not purchase the picture. I thought it was interesting that they offered this service but the photographer himself was very nice and easy going. The customer service of Burgr is truly up to standards. They know how to treat their customers well. They for sure make them feel special and walk out with a happy belly and pretty smile. Would love to come back and get me another burger (maybe the hell's kitchen burger with the jalapeno for the spice and some avocado slices or brittania burger that sounded interesting with mango chutney and sharp cheddar cheese) and my own side of fries to make any Vegas vacation trip an incredible one in my book. Everything I tried here was well worth the price!
This restaurant is located inside the casino in Planet Hollywood. The atmosphere is noisy, but this is worth dealing with because of the very excellent food choices as well as interesting drinks. Our server was so personable and knowledgeable about the menu that we tried some things we might not have if we'd not had her advice. The three of us started with some different beers and a wonderful whiskey lemonade cocktail. Then we tried an order of their onion rings. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was the best ever. We had two sauces served with the rings. Amazing! Our burgers were all different and beautifully served. Again, amazing taste! Definitely not your ordinary burgers! I know Gordon Ramsay's passion is taste, presentation, speed of service, and a manageable menu. He delivers excellence here! Everything coming out of the kitchen was beautifully served. We wanted to try an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries and there were so many, along with two different sauces, that we could not finish them all. This just might have unexpectedly been the best dinner at a restaurant we've ever had.  I would definitely recommend this everyone coming to vegas wanting a phenomenal burger.
Excellent burger way too small for the price $$$$$
My farm burger was perfection! One of the best burgers I've ever had. I thought this might be an overrated touristy place like Holstein's but that was not the case. I pregamed for the Britney show here, and I avoided a huge line by finding an empty seat at the bar. Had a great time. The beer battered maui onion rings were average, but the burger was too damn good to not give this five stars. Plus, good draft selection and good bartenders.
wasn't really impressed with the burgers, felt like they were trying way too hard to be something different, its a burger place, provide quality meat and buns and you're all set! Don't try to re invent the wheel! Decently priced though so its worth to check out at least once to say you have done it. Get the jalapeno poppers!
Fortunately the wait for us wasn't that long to be seated.  We entered the restaurant to greet the hostess...that's right...WE greeted the hostesses because they were too busy talking.. . Hostess takes us to our table.  . . 5 -7 minutes later, waiter shows up.. . We take our orders.... . Jalapeno Poppers. . There House Hog Burger. . Fries. . . 15-20 mins later..... . . everything comes out at ONCE. . Ummm...I'm in the restaurant biz too.... . Appetizers comes out first. . Since we are at this small table, only our Fries and Jalapeno poppers fit on the table.  So we had to grab the burger out of the waitresses hands and transfer onto our small plates.. . Since we're trying to finish everything at once.... . It was not great.. . Jalapeno poppers got soggy since the poppers are displayed inside a shot glass with their cheese sauce.. . Of course...it's cold by now after sitting there for over 5 mins.. . so we couldn't enjoy that.... . Our burger was cooked perfectly but it's cold.. . The apple butter paired perfectly but again, I wish my food was HOT. . The fries were SUPER salty and their dipping sauces did not pair well in my opinion with the fries.. . We didn't see our server the rest of the night, so we couldn't ask him for either additional sauces for the fries and etc.. . Oh well...I'll be going back to Cali for my Umami Burger....Good bye Vegas
holy bejesus, Gordon Ramsay never continues to amaze me. (shout out to Will V. Vleck!!!). Having tried Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, my next stop on the Gordon Ramsay groupie tour was GR BurGR. After a fast 25 minute wait, my brother and I were seated and greeted by the General manager. . . I ordered the Euro Burger and my brother ordered the Hog Burger (the waiter raved nonstop about it) and two sides of Parmesan truffle fries. . Both Euro and Hog Burgers were amazing. The protein was cooked perfectly and complimented the garnish, cheese and bun. While I loved my Euro Burger, I still thought the burger at GR Pub & Grill was superior (that burger was possibly the best burger I ever had). But my brother loved his  Hog Burger and reviewed it as the BEST BURGER he's ever had.. . the truffle fries? oh yeah, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Staff here puts an absurd amount of Parmesan cheese, an ingredient that I adore greatly. One order of fries is honestly enough to serve two tabletop, because the portions are enormous. . . two burgers + two fries= $60. SUCCESS!
Excellent burgers! Could do without the fries. Definitely try the burgers here. They might take a while but they are worth the wait. Good service as well.
5:25 PM 2/28 Regular fries are delicious. Had the Hells Kitchen burger and it was....okay.  The meat wasn't seasoned. I had to add salt and pepper to the actual burger! I ordered my burger medium and it was more on the medium rare side.  . . I will try it again and order something different.  3 stars. ****************20 minutes later*****************. . After all that.  The bartender asked me how I liked my burger and I explained it was good but I asked for medium and it's medium raw so he looked at it and said that the cooks cook it a little under, that's what they do. To this I said medium is medium in any restaurant and if you knew that they cooked under you should've told me when I placed my order so I could order it medium well. At this point he started to get arrogant and began to challenge me so I asked to see the manager.  I explained in full detail the incident to the manager and he not only didn't apologize, he said "I doubt thatthe bartender...." At that point I was livid and disgusted it that he would've question the incident. He finally apologized (after I asked for one) and comp'd my meal but I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was looking for good service!. . A few minutes later I walking around and said to my friend "Gordon is a stickler about meats cooked to proper temp-he would never allow his cooks to cook under temp!". . No I won't be back.  1 star.
My trip to burgr was truly amazing. We showed up at 11 on a Mon.  The servers were smiling and enthusiasm came right thru. We started our meal with jalapeno Popper's. Each Popper had a idividual glass of sauce with it. They were hot but not extreme. The burgers were perfect. They were cooked perfectly with a lightly toasted bun. And the caramel chocolate shake was flavorful and delishius
This was the best restaurant I have been to. I haven't been to many fancy places, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food here was amazing! My friend and I were in Vegas last weekend walking the strip and just happened to see it. There was a small line which was great but it was also 2am. We each got an IPA which was priced well at 8 bucks, and was also delicious. We started with the hummus, and let me tell you, I have had hummus everywhere and this was easily the best I've ever had. It came with bread and fresh grilled veggies both in butter and garlic salt and I never wanted to stop eating it. My friend ordered the Farm Burger which he said was fantastic and I got the Portobello Mushroom Burger, which I've never had before, but at this place is now my all-time favorite burger. I can't even explain how good it was. We also shared fries which were good. The server was fine, nothing amazing but he was very nice. It was expensive for burgers but it didn't matter because we were in Vegas and the food blew our minds. I will now go here every time I go to Vegas, and will try to find more Gordon Ramsay restaurants.
