I would have rather starved than gotten sick from the "gluten free" options they offered. Clearly they weren't. Save yourself.
This may sound silly, but the basket of bread they give you while you wait for your food is the best free basket of bread I have ever had.  Now that I have completely allowed everybody reading this review to delve into my immense reservoir of cheapness I will finish the review.. . Bobby Flay...yadda yadda yadda.  Food Network...yadda yadda yadda.  Great food at Mesa Grill.  Yes!  Amazing food at that.  First, make a reservation...even if you don't think it will be packed.  For some reason many people believe Flay is actually cooking at this restaurant, which is strange seeing that he has many restaurants around the country.  So...needless to say the restaurant is usually packed with people.  Also, the restaurant is smack dab in the middle of Caesars sports book...so do not make this meal a romantic evening.  Make this meal a meal about the good food.  I can just see myself proposing to my girlfriend "Will you marry me?"...with the sounds of "Run you worthless piece of $#%@!"...echoing behind me.. . But I digress.  Onto the food.  Appetizer.  Get the tuna nachos.  It is raw tuna mixed with pico and cilantro and other spices.  These tuna pieces come with nacho chips.  I know what you are thinking....raw tuna nachos?  I swear this is perhaps the best thing in the entire restaurant...if you forget about the Shrimp Tacos, the Burgers, and desserts.  I HATE raw fish.  I HATE tuna.  I LOVE Mesa Grill's Tuna Nachos.  I don't know why that is. It is one of life's great mysteries...along with UFOs, mind control, and the JFK assasination.  . . Another great selection is the shrimp tacos.  Cilantro in abundance.  I love freakin cilantro.  Even if you do not like cilantro very much you will notice how the herb enhances the taste of the shrimp.  The cilantro and spices are the star of this dish....not the shrimp.  Although the shrimp are far superior than many shrimp on the strip.  That sentence rhymed and when you begin sounding like Dr. Seuss it is time to end the review.  One other thing.  The statue of the boxer out front of Mesa Grill is actually Joe Louis.  I tried to look like a man's man in front of my fiance by saying "Look at the Ali statue" but had to cower in wussiness when she realized I was an idiot when it came to boxing.  I know Tennis and Soccer really well....call me a wuss whatever.. . Go to Mesa Grill!
This is one of my favorite spots and I try to get here every time I come to Vegas as sort of our dinner splurge night. The staff is always pleasant and knowledgable, food is served in a timely manner and the ambiance is fun and upbeat without being overwhelming. . . I am not one to pick to eat goat cheese pretty much ever, but we went for the goat cheese queso and polished it off in record time. So so good. They also bring you a great assortment of bread that has chiles baked into it that's kind of perfect for dipping as well. . . We made a reservation (I'd suggest doing that regardless of what night of the week it is) but arrived a bit early and grabbed a drink in the bar. Bartender was super friendly and attentive and was slammed so I was impressed. We were seated right on time and service was prompt from there on out.. . This time I had the chile relleno which is always yummy and my friend got the pork tenderloin which I hadn't had before. She let me try a bite -- I could cut it with a butter knife and it pretty much melted in my mouth. So delicious. . . This place will continue to be a staple for me in Vegas so I hope it doesn't go anywhere anytime soon! Definitely put this one on your list.
We had an amazing time here.   We had a nice table In the back room which was great!!  Our server was amazing he is from Nebraska so we loved him instantly.   We all had margaritas and they were delicious the peach one was by far my favorite.   I had the filet and it was probably the best steak I have ever had it was tender flavorful and a great size.   The cheese appetizer was delicious anything with goat cheese is a winner for me.   Other hits amoung the table were the chicken, salmon, and pork tenderloin.  We finished the night with churros which had awesome dipping sauces.  Can't wait to go back.
The drinks are delicious and the appetizers and entrees were amazing. . . Favorite appetizer: blue corn lobster tacos. They're small but they pack so much flavor in those three bites!!! . . Favorite entree: coffee rubbed filet.  It's got a great kick to it and meat was flavorful and juicy!! . . Desserts were good, not great. I'd suggest getting and extra appetizer or entree instead.
Of all the celebrity restaurants in Vegas, I think that Mesa is the best.  I have eaten here quite a few times over the years, and I have never had a bad meal.  . . This trip I had the 22oz ribeye, and split the mashed potatoes, collard greens, and brussel sprouts.  Everything was perfectly cooked... and I am really critical about my ribeye.  All the food was perfectly seasoned, and went along with Flay's signature style.  . . The meal wasn't cheap, but I felt I got excellent value for my hard-earned dollar.
Not a 3 or 4 star. This place needs some  real work and improvement from salads to steak menu if its claiming an Iron chef menu  ! You will not get a Bobby Flay experience here just descent food.
The food here is unbelievable. We shared the tuna nachos as an appetizer, for my main course I had the grilled lamb chops and for his main course he had the rib eye. We shared two sides, the Brussel Sprouts and the Spinach. The blue corn bread muffins we started with were also tasty. I would definitely recommend everything we ordered. The mango and perfect portion size of the nachos were just right, the lamb chops were cooked perfect and I loved that they were garnished with mint and jalapeno, a nice little kick. I'll definitely be back! I'd also like to mention that I agree with other yelpers, the hostess staff is pretty terrible, we had a reservation and didn't get seated until about 25 minuets after it and there were plenty of open tables, but can't knock the food or the amazing service from our server for that.
I have been to this restaurant several times at the Bahamas location and it was always by far the best restaurant I have been to.   I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of the 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   The manager came over in the midst of this and gave a good fake "I'm so sorry, yada yada yada"   He came off like he was just going thru the motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 the way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in the middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took the plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us the bill and saying the manager took off 2 of the plates and that they went back and investigated the hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in the kitchen.  Almost trying to justify the problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and the manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of the girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on the younger side of the crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to expect.   Overall, the food is amazing here, but how this manager handled our situation made our experience extremely distasteful.
Love it! Unbelievably good pork loin. The coffee rubbed filet is amazing too!
Oh Mesa Grill... I love you. Bobby Flay is wonderful and the flavors that he has created at Mesa Grill are outstanding. If I were ever to be on death row, I'd have Mesa Grill for my last meal. It's ALWAYS a great meal.. This is the 3rd time we've been to Mesa in Las Vegas, and it will not be our last. EVERY time we go to Vegas, we make sure we have dinner here, because it is always wonderful. We were there for New Years Eve, so it was a Prix Fix menu for $120 each with app., entree, and dessert.. I love the cornbread biscuits, I actually bought the Mesa cookbook and love to make them at home any chance I get. The chef prepared three bites for us which included a surf and turf and a tartar. Wish it would've been more than a bite each!. I ordered their classic Margarita, which is made so so well. They have a ton of different Margaritas on their menu, but I always get the classic as it is always good.. Our appetizers were lobster tacos and another Mesa favorite, the duck pancake. The lobster tacos were a bit spicy, so I got to eat them all as the Boy doesn't do super spicy foods. The duck pancake was exquisite as always. . For entrees, the Boy ordered scallops, which I had more than one bite of. I don't like scallops, but these were good. I ordered the rabbit which came with a bone in leg and some additional meat. So so yummy. I don't like bone in food, but I made an exception.. For dessert we ordered the coconut cake to go (which didn't last into the morning). We ordered it last year so we knew it was good. It is very moist and the icing is not super sweet, but it is such a great compliment to the cake. We also ordered the banana pie for dining in which was splendid. Lots of bananas and great flavor. . I cannot wait to go back and I am always looking for excuses to go back to Vegas.
I really don't know how to describe this food other than everything My wife and I got was DELICIOUS. We were feeling brave so we had our waiter Kent surprise us with two margaritas, two appetizers, and two meals. As crazy as this may sound, Kent already won our trust over by introducing himself and having a conversation with us at the bar prior to the restaurant opening. . I'm not going to attempt to describe the dishes we got because It would be a disservice to the chef, but they were all GREAT.. The appetizers Kent ordered for us were the tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale and the blue corn pancake. The tiger shrimp was the favorite of the two, but i feel that's more of a personal taste preference than anything because the Blu corn pancake was killer too!. The entrees consisted of the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and the grilled lamb porterhouse cops. Both were seasoned to perfection and complimented with the perfect sauces.. If you're looking for a nice dinner to compliment your Vegas experience you can't go wrong coming here. Ask for Kent and if you have an open mind and an empty stomach have him order for you  :)
I was a bit disappointed with this MESA grill since I went to the one in Atlantis and absolutely loved it! This one in Las Vegas was only okay.. . I split the shrimp tamale appetizer and it was probably the best part of the meal.. I ordered the filet mignon, and my mom ordered the lobster out of the shell. . Unfortunately the lobster was more like a lobster thermidore which she wasn't expecting nor did she really enjoy.. . My steak was WAY under cooked from the way I ordered it. I couldn't eat a third of it because it was SO red. . . I got the queso mashed potatoes as a side and those were REALLY good...now that I think about it, those were probably the best part of my meal.. . I also ordered the pear margarita and it was really sweet and I couldn't really taste much tequila in it. . . Although I would happily return to the MESA in Atlantis, I probably wouldn't go back to this one.
Underwhelmed and left wishing I didn't eat that. To start, the hostess had all the charm a cinderblock . . . the vocabulary, too. Came for brunch and ordered the quesadilla appetizer to start with a Bloody Mary. Quesadilla was good, but not worth $16. Not hard to make something with bacon taste good. Bloody Mary was good too, but once again again not worth $10. For the main course I had the chiliquiles . . . He needs to review what a chiliquile is. What I got was a very dry corn tortillas, dense scrambled egg on top and some sauces drizzled over . . . Was more of a poorly constructed tostada if anything. Also, the grits were appalling, way over seasoned. The best thing about my visit here was the waiter. Polite, personable and attentive. Will not be coming back to this extremely over priced establishment.
Bests:. Queso Fundido. Ahi tuna nachos. Shrimp tacos. . Pretty good:. Shrimp tamale. Mesa burger. . Wouldn't order again;. Chicken / sweet potato hash. 16 spice chicken salad
I will never go anywhere else for steak besides Mesa grill...I've never experienced any good service and food like this place...
Food was outstanding, service was slow but impecable. Their menu is unique and offers quite distinct combinations (ground coffee rubbed sirloin, and manchego filled chile rellenos). It is a mix of South American food with a modern Mexican twist.The ambience is chic, but area is roomy (hard to find in Vegas). . . Entrees run high on the price range, and they do not come with sides (the brussel sprouts with candied pecans and cranberries was delicious!). Every item was impressive, but again pricey for what you are getting, but then again... you are in Ceasar's palace.... All in all very pleased with our night!
This was our first time back to Vegas in 7 or 8 years. We ate at Mesa back then. This is the ONE place we wanted to go back to. There are so many choices in LV that we only wanted to try new places. But we had to go back to the Mesa Grill. We had brunch this time. If you are into Bobby Flay-type food, look no further.
Best meal I've had in a long time! Came here for lunch with the hubby and we got seated right away. Our server was courteous, knowledgeable and quick. We tried the goat cheese fundido (decent but tasty and unique) shrimp tacos (amazing), spicy chicken sweet potato hash (also amazing) and for dessert we had the banana cream pie. Bobby Flay did not disappoint! Each main entree is a flavor explosion in your mouth and you just don't want it to end. The dessert was rich without being overly sweet - a plus in my book. Def my go-to place next time I'm in Vegas, worth the splurge for lunch!!
***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to Mesa Grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with Mesa Grill's signature dishes)***. . I have been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.. . The familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.. . I started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.. . For my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).. . The pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.. . My dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.. . Service was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.. . Prices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.. . The dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.. . There are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.. . Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.  Like most major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking.
I'm typically wary of celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas, but I've been here twice, and my MO is to check the place out during brunch/lunch if you want to get a sampling of the famous food without paying the higher dinner prices. . . Mesa Grill didn't disappoint -- they start you off with a bread basket with various breads and muffins. The jalapeno cornbread was my favorite.. . We got the tuna nachos appetizer, and it was what you typically expect from an ahi tuna tartare. Not really anything special there, aside from the fancy-cut chips. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I probably wouldn't get them again next time, and go for a more adventurous app.. . The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was great. It had great depth of flavor and spice -- it also had kind of a vinegar-y kick to it that balanced out the starchy sweetness of the potato. Awesome dish.. . The New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin sandwich was also a great choice. The pork was perfectly cooked, and the sauce and arugula complemented the tender pork.. . Great meals both times I've been here -- and worth the slightly high price tag to say you've been to one of Bobby's restaurants.
Eating at Mesa Grill was like licking the inside of an ash tray.  The menu is awesome and the staff was friendly and professional.  The biggest problem with the restaurant is that it is totally open to the smoke filled casino.  You can't really appreciate a good wine or a good cut of steak when you can only smell and taste smoke. . . Mesa Grill is "just okay" and there are many better dining experiences on the strip.
I don't even know where to begin with this place. It's just amazing. The food and the service -- just great! If you want to do good food without gorging yourself at a Vegas buffet, consider going to Mesa Grill.. . You start with a "bread" basket that consists of muffins, corn bread, scones, and various baked goodies. They'll even give you another basket if you ask!. . Next come the entrees. And wow, are they deceivingly small. My girlfriend and I ordered from the brunch menu. She got the Scrambled Egg Chilaquiles and I got the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. Both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of the restaurant! I liked the Chilaquiles over the Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. The texture of the chilaquiles was unlike the traditional mexican version that allows some of the chips to soften as it sits in the serving dish. This version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. It had a wonderful crunch that complimented the soft cheese, egg and sauce.. . Also, I highly recommend the cactus-pear iced tea. Delicious!!
Wow, Amazing and Delicious is all i can say! You start out with a bread-basket with some delicious cornbread, and a unique spread of other tasty breads.  . . I ordered the Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash and my wife ordered the Smoked Shrimp Tacos. My spicy chicken was super delicious and the cuts of chicken were tender too.  What i enjoyed most about the meal is how flavorful, light and filling it is; but not heavy.  My wife hit a home run with the Smoked Shrimp tacos, I actually preferred it over my meal, I loved the smoked flavor of the shrimp, and it tasted superbly excellent.. . For dessert we had the banana pudding which is a nice light dessert to end your dining experience. . . The service was excellent and attentive which I would have expected at an upscale restaurant like this. . . One of the best meals I have had in a long-time you will not be disappointed.
I love Bobby Flay so I was super excited to try this place.  I was so happy I did!!! From the bread basket to the dessert to the margaritas OH MY GOSH!!! Soooo gooood After a long drive from LA this was the best thing to have.  We started with the quesadilla and then I had the smoked salmon club with the fries they wete so good and we had the patron margarita with grand marnier so good!! If you are ever in Vegas you must try this place.
I would drive the 4 hours back to Vegas JUST to eat at this restaurant!
I've eaten a Mesa Grill during every trip I've taken to vegas in the last 4-5 years and it's always been top notch from making a reservation to the great steaks, but my most recent visit on January 21st was disappointing. . . We needed to change our reservation at the last minute and since we were staying at Caesars we first went through the concierge, but when we needed to speak with someone about a time change we were transferred directly to a hostess.  I've worked in restaurants for years and I know it can be stressful and people ask you to move mountains sometimes but I was just trying to add 2 people to our party and try and keep the reservation time as close to what it had been as possible. When I was told we'd need to come an extra hour later I needed to check with everyone first so I said I'd call back in a couple minutes. I called back using the same number 2 minutes later and the concierge said I didn't need to be transferred back and that they would move the reservation. . . Speed forward to 8:45 and the hostess finds our reservation moved but only for 4 people not 6. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude and tells me that she remembers my call and she knows that I needed a table for 6 not the reserved 4 and I can't just show up expecting them to add people AND she specifically told me I'd have to change the reservation to a later time...which I had done. I felt it necessary to point out to her that why would I have moved the res. an hour later if I was keeping the original party size. I was then told that the concierge isn't able to change reservations and I should called her back... I had tried to do just that and was told by the concierge they were capable. . . Long story slightly shorter this hostess was a total bitch and could use a lesson in customer service.  The customer isn't always right, but drop the attitude until you know you're right, ok? . . This whole experience really put me off of Mesa Grill especially after I ate later that week next door at Old Homestead and it was AMAZING. I'll spend my money where I'm getting the total package and not somewhere I'm getting the stink eye from some stuck up 20something
I really wanted to like this place because, yes, I'm one of those people that loves a great chef.  Maybe it was tinted by the fact that we had a few days of such wonderful meals elsewhere (Craftsteak at MGM for dinner and MOZen at the Mandarin for Sunday brunch were awesome) but this was really mediocre. . . Lobster tacos were just fine, my husband had the salmon and had the same response. The best selection would be mine which was the vegetarian chili relleno and I'm not a vegetarian. It was very flavorful and crispy; we both liked it best. My $16 margarita was so tasteless I ended up not finishing it. We realize that when we come to Las Vegas it is expensive and we expect that. When we went to Craftsteak, we spent $300 including the tip (we don't drink much) and we felt it was well worth it. But we left Mesa after spending $150 with tip and felt robbed. The service was good though.
Boring uninspiring lunch menu.  Many better more exciting places to goin Vegas.  Take a miss on Mesa.
Food was really good. Service was ok...the servers were nice, but I don't think service was fine dining worthy. This is more of a casual dining experience that happens to be expensive in price tag. haha. While delivering our food to us, our server dropped my hubbys rabbit on the floor :( I think the leg bone was stuck under the other plate and when he went to place it on the table, something happened and we just saw a rabbit hit the side of our table and fall to the floor. It was so so sad. . . The waiter apologized profusely (well, if "sorry brah, sorry sorry ah, so sorry bro" counts as profusely apologizing haha), and then said he will fire up a new one asap! Cool. Mistakes happen, so that's understandable. What I didn't like however, was that my scallop dish and our other side dishes were sent to wait under the warmer while a new rabbit was fired. It took around 8-9 minutes (umm yes, of course I timed it!). That means my scallop entree sat under a warmer for 8-9 minutes and so did my brussel sprouts and queso mashed potatoes. I don't know if that was the right call. I guess I can't expect them to make all new items, but it just was sad watching my scallops just sit there. It just felt like my food's quality suffered a bit because of their boo boo. . . That being said, the food was damn good. haha. The shrimp garlic corn tamale with cream sauce thing was soooooo good. I wanted like 3 more orders. The rabbit (when we did get it) was very tender and juicy and delicious, and the scallops in brown butter were yummy. The brussel sprouts had good flavor, but I wish they were more of a crispy style. Instead they were soggy and drowned in liquid. But the pomegranate was very unexpected and surprisingly very yummy when paired with the brussel sprout. Queso mashed potatoes was like a really thick mashed potato soup and was really yummmy :) . . Overall, I would definitely eat at Mesa again. I think the food itself was really delicious, I just don't know if service (from the sorry brah action, to the leaving my food on a warmer for 9 minutes) was up to par. I think that for the price tag you are paying (about $30 - $50 an entree), you expect a level of service that you just don't get here.
