Not really my favorite club out of the bunch in Vegas, but it's not bad.  The place is small and there's a lot of stairs. Not as much as Marquee but still a lot for a girl in 5 inch heels to be walking around.  The dance floor gets packed quick unless you're there early.  You pretty much won't be able to see the DJ very easily unless you're either at bottle service or by the walkways. I saw Tiesto and it was pretty cool how they gave out glow bracelets that lit up different colors to the beat of music.  It was all synchronized too!  When he played Red Lights, all of our bracelets glowed a red hue!  Haha, I was pretty entertained.  Aside from having big name DJs, I probably wouldn't prefer to come back since it's so small and I dislike that there's no outdoor area for me to cool down or take a breather at.
Don't get me wrong, I love a crowded club but this has to be one of the worst designed places I've ever been to. They oversell the shows so there is literally no room to walk around, let alone dance. Getting to the dance floor is a nightmare to say the least - and getting off (if they even let you) is even worse.. . Sure, you can always ball out and get a table - and by all means go for it, just good luck getting to it. Stairs everywhere and just no where to stand and enjoy yourself.. . Two stars for the talent they bring in and the production value but XS wins out for best LV club, hands down.
Hakkasan is one of the hottest clubs in Vegas with Calvin Harris as the resident DJ. Calvin was AAAmmmazing. We had a table near the DJ booth which I would recommend spending the money and getting a table because it gets silly packed in there. . . I danced my butt off all night and had a great time. Fog guns, confetti falling down, laser lights. Great Vegas experience!
Meh. This place was sooooo crowded on a Sunday. I think they must have had the other 3 floors closed off??  Anyway it was just the typical lameness I think of when I think of the kind of Vegas clubs that suck. It was too crowded to dance, outrageously priced, design wasn't exciting, and the staff was rude. We weren't even allowed to lean against or sit on anything- even if it's not a bottle service table. Couldn't get comfortable.  I know their bottle prices are a bit more than other places too. DJ was the only solid thing here. . . There are plenty of other places like Tryst or XS I would rather blow my money on.  That's all I can say.
I came here on a Friday night with a couple of my girls. This place was already getting packed at 9:30p! There was no where to sit or lean and the music on the main floor was pretty lame (hardcore EDM stuff) so we moved up to the hip hop room which was just as crowded. I would recommend this place to guys trying to get some, cause there were sooooooo many girls. .  Overall this place lost me with the long line, the alright-for-Vegas drinks, and the guys my dad's age. I am glad we got in for free because I would not pay for that kind of treatment.
where to start with "hakkastairs" I mean Hakkasan, honestly the worst thing about it is the stairs you have to walk up and down to get to different levels of the club.This club is mostly meant for bottle service. Dance floor is very small and unless your an all girl group I suggest buying tickets a couple weekends in advance. EARLY ARRIVAL is strongly recommended!!!. . Now for the positives they easily have the best DJ lineup in vegas if your into EDM.From Calvin Harris,Tiesto, Hardwell, and newly added young Dj's Martin Garrix and W&W they clearly have the edge in that category. A lot of people call it a 5 story club but the main room is actually only 2 levels. Plenty of bars to purchase drinks and also a hip hop room for those of you that actually came to dance at the nightclub. Hakkasan is really all about quality girls which is why I strongly recommend this club for the guys, and Ladies are often brought up to VIP tables to share drinks with big spenders. So your definitely guaranteed a long night at this venue.. . From the beautiful staff, big name Dj's, & exclusive VIP bottle service they offer...I truly believe Hakkasan lived up to the hype. The scary thing is they just opened. usually it takes a nightclub about a full year to really work out all the kinks with guest list line, bottle presentations, tick sales etc. so if you had a bad experience I do recommend going back for another go at it.
Went on Thursday night on a total whim.  I was in town for work all week and this was the last night.  We had been other places and @1 am decided to head to Hakkasan.  Most of the group bailed so we just paid for general admission (no line) it was mixed guys and girls, so I don't know if we paid the same or not (just gave a total and we threw in the money).  I had to pay $5 to check my "jacket" it def went with my outfit and they said blazers and sweaters could stay on, but honesty it was so hot on the dance floor I am glad I didn't have it.   The place was packed and crazy party atmosphere.  Nervo was the DJs that night and they were awesome.  I had no problem getting and staying at the front, even after leaving to get a drink, but the dance floor was packed and everyone was having a blast! They were on until 3 am and we danced the entire time. I found out later a work group did get a VIP room and they said it was epic lol :) Next time my group will get a VIP table and go earlier, but for a complete whim, it was perfect night dancing.
Saturday, February 1st - Calvin Harris. . . Our Hakkasan experience was AWESOME because we really got hooked up. Comp upper-level table and drinks for half the night with superb waitress service, then table right by the dance floor with Dom Perignon champagne and fresh fruit, plus Grey Goose vodka shots galore. Couldn't have asked for a better night. . . Music was BLARING though, but I was entirely sober. Hakka gets incredibly (I'm talking sardines) crowded, but all in good fun. Might rub elbows with some celebs, whether Chris Brown or Singaporean pop stars. Say what?
[Note: This review is for DJ Moby on Sat., Feb. 8th.]. . Coming into Hakkasan is an interesting experience.  On the one hand, it's a club that has a lot going on but the attitudes/tight space may turn you off.  . . That isn't to say that everyone was outright mean.  The staff was super friendly (at least in the beginning of the night) and helpful and people off the dance floor were not bad for the most part and getting in wasn't too much of a pain (with a pre-paid ticket - $30 for guys).  My complaints on people come into some of the really pushy guys and girls along with just some mean-spirited acts.  For instance, guys, come on - I saw someone in front of me do the 'dropped pencil' routine to try to fondle a girl from behind.  Not classy and not cool - giving a bad rep to all the guys out there.  The volume of the music by the way can get pretty loud too so be aware if you have sensitive ears.  Additionally, drink costs of course are high as always - note too that they don't serve tap water here - you have to buy a bottle for $9. [thumbs down]  One other note - the dance floor is really tight.  Expect to be squished in and get your feet stepped upon no matter how careful you are.  Also take care of your belongings in these cases.  . . So with all these cons, what's left?  I think where it counts, Hakkasan is pretty amazing.  Big kudos to DJ Moby - he has so much energy where he gets on top of the DJ booth to get people hyped and his sounds are in your face and bold.  Bigger props to Mark Etson, the DJ before Moby that really held the fort down.  I've been to so many clubs where the first DJ has trouble establishing much of a groove and excitement but Mark handled his time like the main act.  Even though I was exhausted by the end of the night, the experience on the dance floor is worth it.  This is probably also helped by the smart lighting of the 'living ceiling' in which it seems like lights protrude out of the ceiling like blood vessels (couldn't think of a better analogy).  There's also a few other floors supposedly - on this night, only the Ling Ling Room with the hip hop was there.  Smaller dance floor and the atmosphere is very very different but it was cool to see the contrast and gives you options versus some other clubs.  . . I did think Hakkasan was a little pretentious to begin with and the space area/stairs/elevators reminded me of Marquee in that the dance floor is squished and the people around you aren't exactly the friendliest bunch.  However, the music and atmosphere/aesthetics really made up for it where it counted.
Bought presale tix online for under $20, but we still had to wait in line.  Granted, the line might have been shorter.  Waited about 20 minutes on a Sat night, past 11 p.m.  The place was packed, but surprisingly I never had to wait to use the restroom -amazing!  There was also more room on the highest level, which looked down on the main dancefloor, since it's mainly a bar and tables.  If you want to get a drink at the bar, go to the bar there bc you won't have to wait too long.  Tommy Trash was spinning, and you could hardly get through the dancefloor.  We walked through it once and chose not to again.  We didn't go in the hip hop room, though it was a little less crowded.  I'm not a fan of the layout or of all the stairs, but if you want to go to a large club with lots of people, this might be the place.  If you want good looking, go elsewhere.  There is also no outdoor area.
I'm more like 1 1/2 stars but i'm being generous. . . As far as Vegas clubs go, it was okay (because most Vegas clubs are lame). The bathroom attendants wore suits which i thought was a nice touch, it made it seem a little more up market. . . It was 'Very Vegas' in terms of the lay out. They had part of the dance floor as a walk way around reserved tables, similar to a strip club. So women would dance up high and guys sitting at reserved tables could watch. That doesn't exactly scream classy like the bathroom attendants would imply. . . The main problem? The bar tenders. There was only like two at each bar. There wash't a line to get a drink, but it took forever to get served. Okay Hakkasan, not many people are going to spend $18 on a drink (so i understand the understaffed bar) but for those who are, SERVE THEM QUICKER! . . Bottom line: It's not a great club if the most impressive part is the bathroom attendants attire.
I will preface this review with the fact that I am not a member of the club scene.. . That said, unless someone you love is playing here, stay away.. . 1) Getting in. What a pain! They require you to check your coat and charge $5 per coat/item. I'm not a cheapskate but this feels like a total scam. Then, even if you are on a list they may not be able to find you because they have about 4 lists with different security guards that don't match and if they don't see you on the list they are rude. I think I would have bailed at that point if I had to pay a cover and even the cover line was backing up a lot.. . 2) Drinks. Why on earth are they charging $16 for a GIN & TONIC??? Or even a RUM & COKE??? I don't even want to know what they were charging for specialty drinks.. . 3) Music, eh. I only recognized 1 song the whole time but again take that with a grain of salt, I'm not a big clubber and well, dubstep... it's hard to tell when 1 song ends and a new one begins.. . 4) Atmosphere. Absolutely gorgeous! The architecture is beautiful, very open with an Asian Fusion feel. . . 5) Extras, they seemed to have some interesting extras including a giant sparkler at the VIP booths, but really, unless you hit the jackpot, it seemed a bit over the top.. . It was nice to go once to see what the fuss was about but I think I'll be looking for something different on my next Vegas adventure.
If you're planning on going here, buy your tickets in advance because you'll pay more at the door. It isn't worth it if you don't have a table and you came to see the DJ, in my opinion. Music is great, great vibe, great atmosphere. Drinks are overpriced but that's expected in a Vegas nightclub. Barely any space to move on the dancefloor in front of the DJ if you don't have a table. Not worth the money paid for cover. I've seen Calvin Harris perform better sets at Miami nightclubs.
Ive been wanting to come here for awhile. It was okay.. I came Sat Feb 15 with my guy. I don't like waiting in lines so we bought tickets ahead of time (guys you are expensive! I feel bad for you dudes). Best decision though cause the line to get in was huge.. Gentlemen, unless you got a hook-up or don't mind dishing out $80-$100 to get in, find another club.. The club has a nice layout. The stairs though, ladies be warned. Thankfully there were elevators, and friendly bouncers. I've heard they can be mean.. Main floor was like a sardine can. A fight broke out. it was funny. I was grumpy cause Calvin Harris didn't come on till 2am. I actually liked the 2nd floor better. I think it was the hip hop club. . Calvin Harris made the night though. Still had a good time. . If you haven't experienced it I'd recommend to try it out. Everyone has different likes!. That being said, I do prefer XS & Marquee. At least there you can go outside for fresh air.
Hakkasan's first nightclub debuted just 7 months ago back in April "13. The team behind Hakkasan spared no expense in designing their colossal nightclub & restaurant. This megacomplex clocks in at over 80,000 square feet, giving it top honors as one of the nation's largest nightclubs. The highly sought-after DJ's can earn upwards of $200,000 per night. The lighting and the sound system are first-rate with concert-rated acoustics. There are 5 levels of club space with a variety of experiences on offer. . . The main level dance floor was outrageously packed. If you like being jostled around, elbowed and shoved, then you will definitely feel at home here.  If you even idled for even a second in a walkway, a bouncer would rudely yell at you to move --we were just trying to make our way to the front of the bar. The music wasn't my preferred-style of dance music--it was house music all night. The music selection wasn't the problem though, it was all the rudeness and shoving going on everywhere. The $18 rum 'n cokes and $10 beers definitely did not excite either (I know it's Vegas but my concert drinks at MGM Garden were $18 for a double). . . Despite the crowded dance floor, high-priced drinks and music, my girlfriends and I decided to make the most of the night and embrace the music and our Hakkasan experience. We danced and enjoyed the confetti drop and looking at some well-dressed fellas. We enjoyed rounding out our nightclub experience with the addition of Hakkasan. I've heard the restaurant has some creative and delectable dishes...maybe next visit I can get back over there to try out the dining experience.
Hakkasan is pretty much my favorite club in vegas. As a local, I've been to if not all but most of the clubs in las vegas. This is so far the best! The line up of DJ's are pretty awesome too!!  I've seen , Steve Aoki, Tiesto, Hardwell, Dada Life, Nervo, Quintino, Martin Garrix, Calvin Harris and Etc ... :) It may be a little pricey but hey, if you're in vegas might as well spend some cash.
I really enjoy the food! I had short ribs and calamari for apps and spicy noodles and Seabass.... Ambiance is fantastic!!!! Good cocktail menu as well
If I could give a zero star I would.. . I have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. . . I have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers.
Oh how I wish I'd have read these reviews before going to this club. Pretty spot on. Shame on me. Free entry for me and 3 girlfriends through a promoter. Promoter asked us to be there at 9:30. Only after entering, we learned Calvin Harris wouldn't be on until 1:30am. . . Inside was nice, but definitely not designed to accommodate the crazy number of people let in. We sat in the lounge area until about 11, when we attempted to hit the dance floor. It was like a mosh pit in both floors. If you can push your way into the dance floor area, you can't even move. We had drinks spilled on us, took elbows to the head, had our feet stomped on. I don't doubt these yelpers stories of getting their phones and wallets stolen, how easy for the scumbags. Also, if you're with a group of girls, you have to battle the creeps (the creeps who pay $80-$120 cover just to get in) rubbing right against you and you have absolutely nowhere to go. . . $20 watered down drinks. My jager bomb was tiny and AMF just tasted like triple sec. As another yelper mentioned, 18% "tax" on drinks. Is this legal? It is very clear it's all about the money for this establishment, they completely rob you. We left at 1, before Calvin Harris even went on, and they were Still letting people in. What a disappointment.
I am not a nightclub kind of a girl.. Admittedly, I am not one of "the beautiful people" who feels comfortable sporting a dress with my back end practically exposed...I AM a dancer, but I really don't know how to "club" dance.  . The last time I went to a club, was about six years ago, and I hated it.. . This Friday night, a friend of mine invited me out with a big group to Hakkasan, saying that theycould get me in for free.  . . I decided to give it a go, and not be a party pooper...just because I didn't like it 6 years ago, doesn't mean I won't like it now.. . We arrived, and there was a SWARM of people waiting to get in.. The friend who had the "hookup" went and talked to security, and apparently it wasn't completely free..to get 4 people in, it ended up costing $160.  The friend took care of it, and told us not to worry about paying her back, which...to be honest...I wouldn't have gone in had I known that she had covered THAT much money for us.  I'm sorry, but I'm not used to having to pay a cover when I want to go and dance, let alone pay $40 a person.  . . So...strike one, too expensive to get in.. . The place itself is beautiful.  They have candles and incense lining the halls.  Its two stories, so if you don't want to get caught up in the madness that is the dance floor downstairs, you can go upstairs, where its not quite AS busy.. . The music was great.  Above and Beyond was playing that night...we actually didn't stay for them, but whoever the DJ was before them, was excellent.  I enjoy EDM and Electronica, even though I'm not super skilled at dancing to that kind of music.. . The dancefloor was jam packed.  Uncomfortably so for me.  I have a tendency to be a bit introverted, and claustrophobic at times...so next time, I'll either bring money to drink so I don't care, or I'll stay upstairs and dance there.  . . It was a great experience, but let me tell you, don't go to this place without PLENTY of money for alcohol if you're going to drink.  We got a vodka cranberry for $16.  That's a bit extreme, even for being downtown.... . I liked it.  I'd like to go back, but only for musicians that I really know and like...if Krewella plays there I'll be back for sure....in the meantime, I'm going to put some money aside for drinks for when I do go.  ;)
I came for the Calvin Harris show on Sat Feb 15.. Fergie (dj) opened up for him.. as other reviews say.. lots of stairs haha.. had lots of fun!! Calvin didn't come on til 1:30 am I think.. was a really late night for me but awesome overall.. . A couple of negatives : Overpriced drinks... I overheard these girls in front ordering 2 drinks and I think they said it was $35. I drank beer and I think it was like $10 each maybe. Also, It's pretty sexist that the Calvin tickets were more than double the cost for the guys than the girls!. . Even with the couple of negatives, I still had an amazing time and I would recommend to anyone,,, but you'll have to splurge a bit!
Good sound system and lighting, but the design is kind of weird. there are stairs everywhere and I saw drunk people falling on them all night. Also they let way too many people in and its packed to the point where you can't move at all. Not worth it unless you have a table/bottle service
What a trippy night this was..... . The club in itself I didn't find to be "the nicest/best" club in the country as I had heard.... It is supposedly the largest club though. . . Getting there, my 2 guy friends and I were on a guest list.... We showed up at 2:30, and apparently the list closed at 1. . . Casey, the guy/manager at the door, I'm not sure if he found out that we had been on some list, or he just wanted to be sweet and let us in. . . Either way, he was very cool, didn't give us a hard time at all, and let us in. And I would say normally it's probably "difficult" to get 1 girl and 2 guys in. . (So thank you Casey... ment a lot to me). . The place was pretty packed. . It was Sunday, and Steve Iokai(sp?) was playing. . . I had an amazing night for the last 1.5 hrs, . But only really because it was a trippppy night lol if ya know what I mean. . . I wouldn't jump to the idea of going back to Hakkasan. But I had an awesome time while I was there.
Came here last night for a friends bachelor party.  I wasn't that impressed with the club in comparison to XS.  Basically, one level is all booths and the next level is the dance floor (but was kind of like a maze trying to get around the joint).   They had a local dj playing, so nothing great, they might have gotten an extra star if they had a better dj playing.  I just think the overall design blew, plus the drinks were crazy expensive, but that's expected at any club in Vegas.  Would I go here again?  Hell no!!  XS or Marquee is the only way to go in Vegas, just my 2 cents!
This club is so fowl, shame on the kardashians or the MGM for ever being affiliated. My friends and I come I Vegas all the time and we are pretty decent looking 24 year olds at worst. We don't pay to get into clubs and always have a great time in Vegas as most girls do. Our 1st experience w Hak we waited in line for over an hour after all of these stories and excuses... Finally made it to the front and they told us it was 30 each haha funny. Other girls we know had dealt with the same thing. . . This weekend we decides to give it another try. Got in from some random guy as the promoters list we were on ironically was not working that night ... Surprisingly had a  good time and got a girls table with free booze then after being there for literally 4 hours one of he bouncers tells me I have to stay on the girls table side I'm like okay but all my friends are here ( 2 feet away) and he forces me to go by myself to the other side or he will kick me out. If I was hammered and being obnoxious I would understand 100 percent but that's not the case. I'll stop there as this club is a joke. Boycott.
This place was pretty standard for a night club, I thought. There were some impressive pros and some major NOs. . . First $110 for male entry - wtf? Who would pay that? Thank god we were on the list because there's no way I would ever dish up that kinda cash. . . We went into the lounge part of the club, which was nice and not overly loud. We could hear our group talking and we had a nice time. The bartenders (at the bar) in this  section were SUPER professional. He realized that we were a large group and introduced himself by name. Unlike other Vegas nightclub bartenders, he actually seemed to care that we were there spending $20/drink. Nice touch. . . My friend and I took a tour of the rest of the  club and it was impressive in a lose-yourself-in-a-sea-of-flesh/noise/smoke sorta way. Each level had a different feel and vibe... Pretty cool.
We met one of the promoters on the strip. He said he used to work for surrender and he didn't like it because they don't keep their promises. When you hear someone talking sh*t about the previous company he worked with, you know he's not that trustworthy.. We were originally gonna go to surrender but after his flattering speech, we decided to go check out hakkasan. And guess what we waited outside for 20 minutes and waited inline for another 45 minutes even tho we were on his guest list. His tickets did nothing for us either.. . We thought that this is a pretty giant venue according to the promotor, but it was not that big at all. The top floor was the most crowed. People were pretty happy their but it was way too crowed for us to dance. Too many people. So we moved down one floor where theres a lounge ish with dance floor place with Chinese lanterns. The music was very very weird there... Then we decided to leave.
My girls and I came here on a friday night. A friend that lives in town hooked us up with a great connection. We got in within seconds. The music and vibe of the club was amazing. So here is why I gave it three stars. I had my iphone5s and cash stolen from a purse. I had my purse on me the whole time but we were in the dance floor which was elbow to elbow before I knew it someone unzipped my purse and took my items. I then informed a guard who then called the lead guard of the place. He asked me who I thought it was but I wasn't too sure because there was a lot of different people around us. He then informed me that without me being sure he couldn't search anyone because it would bring a possible lawsuit to them. I was very upset and shocked that someone stole my iphone mostly cash can be replace but my phone had a lot of information. So basically my advice to others is to be careful and cautious when attending this club. One good thing about this place is that when we arrived we received a extra stamp to come back in again later. The guard was helpful but I know they have the best cameras that he could've looked into. Oh and drinks are about $20 bucks each. Last thing they do have an elevator so you don't have to take those long long stairs.
Went back to Vegas this past weekend and decided to give this place another try, especially since Danny Avila was there.. . My experience was remarkably different and I attribute it to the fact that its not pool season quite yet and club crowds in Vegas are manageable. We got in with no fuss, no muss, stood in a single line compared to the 5 I was shuffled into before only to be rejected because of their own error. . . Once finally in the club there were a lot of stairs but if you cant handle them in heels than you probably cant handle dancing too long in them either so not a biggie.. . Overall I have to admit I had a good time from what I remember, it was crowded but not obnoxiously so. I can't imagine coming here in the pool season and not having a table because you would be miserable. Definitely a VIP focused club. . . If I want someplace to get a table or come back in the off season I will definitely be back to Hakkasan. Otherwise I will stick with more open area clubs.
Loved it! The nightclub is beautiful and most importantly, it was spacious!!! The bouncers were very efficient and not a$$holes like the bouncers at other places. We saw Danny Avila and he put on a GREAT show. There was plenty of places to wander around and stand to enjoy the music. I was able to slip into the front row pretty easily. . . I definitely prefer this place over the other hot clubs in Vegas right now. My promoter was great. Private message meif you want the hook up and to be put on the guest list!!
