This is my favorite place in downtown Phoenix for Happy Hour.  Deliciously crafted cocktails at a very cheap price, with a wonderful, homey atmosphere - nothing is better.  After Happy Hour it does get a little pricey, but everything I have tried here has been so good that I do not mind at all.  I would definitely try the burger, as well as the fingerling potatoes or baked goat cheese - all great choices to accompany your happy hour drink.
I go here for brunch a lot. The food is amazing. The decor is very chic and modern. W them renovating an old firehouse is such a cool idea!! I get the egg sandwich, they cook the egg anyway you like so I get it scrambled. Yummy. Also their caramel cinnamon roll is to die for!!! Yes, it's huge, and has tons of calories but so worth it!!! Share it w friends!!! Also I luv their mimosas!! A great place to eat, hang out w friends.
My husband and I rode our motorcycles there yesterday and found ALL valet parking. Hmmm... The decor is eclectic and the old wall safe in the bathroom is so cool. My husband had the onion burger and I had the pork chili verde. The fries were AMAZING and he loved the burger but the green chili pork was greasy and tasted average. Not much green chili flavor. I had two eggs on top that were cooked to a rubber consistency. The service was below average as we were forgotten frequently and left with empty water and pop glasses.  The tables are very close together and you can hear other people's conversations. We will try it again but make sure we have time to sit and wait for service.
First time here.  Great decor and atmosphere.  Loved the building.  Unfortunately, the food was a disappointment.  Not bad, just not great and certainly not worthy of the bill.  My food came out not that hot.  Meat was a little tough.  And the mashed potatoes were cold  My date's food was hot but not cooked to her specification.  Service was very slow.  Did not get our food out for almost 30 minutes.  First visit and probably my last.  Would not recommend this place.  Much better choices for the money.
Very relaxed atmosphere, but a bit on the dressier side (maybe because I was here for Sunday brunch). The service was fantastic, they were extremely helpful and answered a lot of questions since some people in our party had dietary restrictions. I had the eggs benedict - delicious and more filling than it looks! I wish they'd told me beforehand though that avocado costs $2 extra... in that case I wouldn't have bothered (bumping it up to $15 for eggs benedict which is on the pricier side). Would come back!
So it t'was valentines day and I decided last second that me and my date should go there for Vday dinner.. . I personally have only had drinks there while my date had been some time before and actually had the food. She had said it was not that bad and since we were both pretty laid back considering the holiday I was not setting myself up for anything amazing.. . We walked in maybe at the end of the dinner rush and found two seats at the bar quickly. A small bar space but intimate I guess. Greeted promptly by our bartender and bar-back with smiles and served my wine with a small recommendation based on what I like.  A good start so far.. . Having just got done from teaching yoga my date wanted simple. "Cheese flat bread please, to start" i asked the bartender, Once finished consuming our starting plate i was neither impressed or disappointed. I mean who can really mess up a cheese pizza?? I do appreciate lots of basil and garlic though if the pizza is to be without any other special toppings. Anyways, still enjoyed it very much.. . We ordered than the pot roast for our shared entree. I thoroughly enjoyed it but found the meat a bit cold on the bottom???? nothing worth sending it back since the rest of the plate was delicious but how was it any bit cool when it arrived so quickly? sort of a mystery to me.. . Overall our dinner was short and we had a good experience. I would only say that a almost $20 plate should come out steaming hot. That is all. Service was top notch and I will definitely be back sooner than later :).. . BTW their baker comes in after hours to make all of their bread. that is amazing and good luck finding that in most any other establishment.
The food was good however I thought the atmosohere would be better. Maybe it was because we were sitting upstairs?? Do like that they take reservations and the fingerling potatoes were excellent.
I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. . . I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. . . I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.. . The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.. . The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. . . The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.. . My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. . . With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.
We came for dinner and it was good. I definitely want to get back for brunch as I've heard that's great. I like the light rail accessibility.
St Francis Restaurant.... well love it or hate it!. I also have mixed feelings about this place and it is not so much about their food and drinks but more about their services.. Twice now we were forced to wait an additional 45 minutes before being seated even thought we had reservations.. Several couples which came way after we arrived were seated first.. Food is alright but service lacks IMHO.. Won't be back!
Happy hour is a must here. :)) ehh, pricey,  but its sooo good.. During lunch time is way more busier than it is at night time. Totally two different atmosphere.. I love the huge screen tv thing they have going on outside to watch the game on. Go suns! . . I like the ambiance of this place.. . Cheese pizza and a side salad was good for me. :)
Like the atmosphere of this place. Only had a drink after work so I can't comment on the quality of the food. The menu looked interesting enough that I'd come back and our bartender was cool to chat with.. . Daniel H., you should check it out.
