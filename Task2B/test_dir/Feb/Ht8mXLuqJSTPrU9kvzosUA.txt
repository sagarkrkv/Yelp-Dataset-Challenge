Been here multiple times over the years with varying experiences. The only thing really consistent is the crowd. The best way to get into here is to stay at the Cosmo. Hotel guest get in for free on Fri nights. Drinks are fine, its great that they have an indoor and outdoor area. . . Having two separate rooms for different types of music is definitely a plus. Glad that they cater to both crowds. The only thing to complain about this club is that the dance floor is not very big. It is however really beautiful and because it isnt big, it provides a closeup feeling to whoever is performing that night. Love the giant LED screen behind the DJ.
The stairs...... they suck.....  it's fun when you have a table, but to be honest, the service is really awful. My group had paid for a table for a bachelorette party, but when our bottles were almost done, they were rude and kicked us out because someone bought out our table. I totally get that whole buying out tables thing, but the staff literally were completely rude about it and acted as if we didn't just drop about $1000 on the table and that we came from the back alley. . .  My promoters get always get us in and every so often, open bar for girls, but the staff is rude. I try to avoid coming here, but sometimes they have great DJs.
The hip hop room was packed. I was by the dj stand just hanging out with the Dj's. It was Dj Redfoo of LMFAO. Who was cool as his cool hair and gogo dancers.  He posed for a pic behind the Dj booth and wished us celebrating a happy bday.  Thanks Redfoo!  Then moved up to the rooftop EDM room.  If you want the total vegas experience. This is the room you want to be in.  Mosh pit if that's your thing with confetti shooting out at the crowd. The space girls intergalactic dancers on top of the dj was entertaining. The pool area.  Wait am I in Miami or Vegas? Pro-Favorite overall club in Vegas coz I had a good experience with the Dj's, the dancers, security, servers, & I liked the polite mixed crowd.  Con-getting a workout walking up I don't know how many flights of stairs.  Almost felt like I was a Firefighter in training.  I got to take the elevator back down to reality so that was good.  Gals & guys if you are wearing heels!  Take that sh*t off and bring your workout shoes.  After going up those flights of stairs you might end up soaking your feet in the pool instead of dancing the night away
Had a great Friday night. Candyland headlined and they were awesome.  Just watch out who you go through to get bottle service. We had some issues in the beginning, however once we got our table it was all good. . . The venue is pretty sweet and you don't feel too far away from the DJ. Hip hop outside at the pool area and edm inside.  . . Our hostess and servers were really friendly and helpful at all times.. . Bottle service is the only way to go in Vegas.
SWEETEST BOUNCERS IN VEGAS!!. . My friend got her phone and id stolen while we were here and they all were so helpful and kind and truly seemed to feel bad. In the morning when she called the lost and found she was told that a bouncer had found her id and turned it in to them. The lost and found was extremely organized and helpful. . . As for the actual club, just the fact that they have a hip-hop room makes it better than almost every other club in town.
I'm sad that my favorite club in Vegas has noticeably went down a notch. The hip hop room is always closed (the last 3 times I went over the past 6 months, the room was closed!). My friend even called to ask if the hip hop room would be open, and they said yes. This was a lie! It was closed yet again! . . They also played Justin Bieber. :( more sadness all around.
Marquee is the best!!!!  Besides XS that is :) . . I've been to Marquee on numerous occasions and have yet to have any bad experience there. Saw Benassi this past weekend and from start to finish everything went perfect! The bouncers were very nice, to the girls at the register charging to get in. Drinks are on the pricey side, but it's Vegas. The bartenders are really great too! Super cute and nice. . . The dance floor it's self really isnt that big. So get there early, or just know how to get in ;) . . Sound system is top notch!. . Lighting is on another level! Simply amazing! A Must go to spot.
I never thought that I would have such a horrifying experience at this club, which I've been to a handful of times in the past. I came to celebrate my birthday with my cousins and things were fine until around midnight when we took a break from dancing. We were outside near the bar and gambling tables when I noticed a security guard talking to one of my cousins (I'll refer to him as K). I stepped in to make sure everything was ok because the guard looked pretty intense. When I inquired, the guard said that K had a flask and wouldn't turn it over. (This was true because we had asked him to bring one--although he actually didn't even use it!) The guard said he had to leave, so I said we were sorry and we would all go with him. Yes, these things happen and I knew we were wrong for bringing the flask. When I said we were going, too, the guard said we couldn't go with him, but we could meet him somewhere. I grabbed a few of my cousins and we just hurried through the club as the guard led him away. Then another guard came by to help escort him (K was compliant and it seemed unnecessary to have two guards, but whatever. We just hurried up to make sure we could be with him.). Anyone who has been to clubs and has gotten asked to leave knows that it is normal and expected for your group to go with you to make sure everything is ok. But when we reached the elevators to go down, they wrenched him away from us and now there were six guys. Four were in the elevator with him, pinning him against the wall. We asked the two men in front of the elevator, who were blocking us from him, why we couldn't go with him. We said that we didn't want to cause any problems, but we just needed to know he would be ok. My cousin tried to have the manager let her in, but he pushed her back.  K started calling for help because they were hurting him. We could see that the four guards had him slammed against the wall and were starting to choke him out to keep him from calling to us. I can still see the fear in his eyes and I will never forget the sounds of his voice. He was so scared and we were so helpless, trying to just protect him from whatever was about to happen. K is the sweetest kid, and he was compliant.  He was not drunk or belligerent. They were using unnecessary force and they wouldn't even tell us where they were taking him and why 4-6 men were needed to make him leave. He struggled against them only when they started hurting him and choking him. We left the club and asked the front door bouncer what we should do next and where we could find him. He advised us to go back to our hotel because they would most likely put him in a cab. But it was so suspicious that we couldn't just leave with him! It's as if they didn't want us to witness what they were doing, which was using unnecessary force for no good reason. We left for our hotel and told the rest of our family to wait there to see if they would release him, which they did about 20-30 minutes later. . . When K came back, he told us what happened. He had been choked out (there were red marks all over his neck) and he was holding a paper towel covered in his blood. He had woken up on the floor near a back elevator of the hotel because they had choked him out to the point of a black-out. If that wasn't traumatizing enough, the guards asked him repeatedly what he remembered. He was alone and afraid, and although he remembered every horrific moment of their abuse, he was afraid to say a word of it. He knew it'd make it worse and they'd probably keep him longer...so he said he didn't recall. And they implied that he had probably accidentally hit his head or fell and passed out somehow. But the truth is they did it! They feigned ignorance and pretended to play nice at that point to cover up their dirty deed. They got him a paramedic to clean up all the blood on his face and hands...there was even drops of his blood on the floor. He cried when he told us because he was so traumatized.  My heart truly broke for him and I was so appalled at this wrongdoing. It could have happened to any of us! It has probably happened before to other people...people who were compliant and didn't want any trouble, just like K. We knew we had to try to do something to correct this huge injustice and act of violence, so we called the Cosmopolitan hotel to file a formal complaint. Then we called the LV police. They sent two officers to our room to take down a report. Neither acts yielded any progress. I felt that we got brushed off as if this incident wasn't important. I cannot believe that nothing can be done. I fear for everyone's safety that goes to Marquee now. I will never set foot in this club again. I advise that no one else go here either. What happened is so wrong, and I plead with you to spread the word about this injustice. Please do not give this place your business.
Worst experience in a nightclub ever. Was having an ok time, nothing special, until things went crazy over a flask a friend had.  We filed a police report over what security did. They wanted my friend to leave and he agreed, and we decided to leave with him. Security wouldn't let anyone go with them while they took him in the elevator.  It was one unimposing guy surrounded by 4 giant security guards, they pushed him against the elevator wall and made his nose bleed then they choked him until he was unconscious.  They then tried to convince him they found him that way.  My friend pretended to agree with them because he was scared for his safety, but he was not drunk and remembered everything. They had their first aid person clean him up and only let him leave after he pretended to go with their story.  We filed a police report and are looking into legal action.  If security ever takes your friend here, get their names and take their photos. Do not trust them. Do not write this off as drunk belligerence. None of us were drunk, he did not resist them. I hope this does not happen to you, but I know it has happened to others.
I have been to Marquee more times that I can remember.  My usual Vegas crew loves EDM music and before Hakkasan and Light opened up, Marquee was THE best place for EDM music.  Although in my opinion, I like XS just a little bit more, Marquee still holds its own. . . Highlights of Marquee. . -Large and gorgeous venue: It is both an indoor and outdoor club so there's a small, correction, very small, dance floor and an even better outdoor section with a pool, gambling tables, bottle service tables, cabanas, and a bar.  Warning, they do not let you go into the pool like XS does,do not even think about putting your feet in there.  Just stay away from the pool and you will be fine.  There is also a smaller hip hop room that you see, on your right, when you're walking up the stairs.  Why anyone would even want to be in that room is something I will never understand.  It is small so it gets very hot, and honestly if you want hip hop music go to 1Oak or something.  You are not getting the Marquee experience in that room.. . -Awesome DJ's: I've seen Gareth Emory, Armin (sorta), Above and Beyond (twice), and Markus Schulz, just to name a few. . . -Free drinks and early table service for groups of girls: I guess if you get there early enough and they have unsold tables and you have a good group of girls.  They will set you up with a table and one free drink.  You can stay there for as long as the table is unsold, after they sell the table, and believe me, they will sell the table, then you have to leave.  . . -Clean bathrooms: Ladies, the bathroom at Marquee is wonderful.  Clean and there's plenty of stalls, you never have to wait that long for a stall.  They are a little hard to find though, but head towards coat check and you'll find the restroom.. . Cons of Marquee. . -The stairs into and out of the club.  Unless you're one of the lucky few who get to take the elevator, get ready to work out them legs and walk up and down the stairs. . . -Density of crowd: It gets ridiculously packed in there, and unless you have a table it is really hard to move, let alone dance if you are on the dance floor.  Everyone just ends up chilling outside cause it gets so packed and hot in there.. . -Security: This can be a pro and a con, because I will admit security does do their job, but damn they are so strict and mean.  Like I said, pro and con because I like the fact that they are good at their job but they are also a*******. . . Tips: Try to go in with either an even ratio of guys and girls or more girls than guys.  Drinks are pricey, people stop whining about drink prices.  If you want cheap drinks go buy a bottle and drink in your hotel room.  Nobody said Vegas was cheap.
Just went to Vegas in January and in the winter Marquee's cool factor went down a lot for me. The hip-hop room was closed (sad times. Super sad times). They said hip-hop was playing outside (which they had covered) but it wasn't really hip-hop. More like techno infused top 40. . . Whatevs. Guess it's a summer destination type place only.
Super awesome pool party. I went to the halfway to edc pool party during winter and it felt like it was summer. I had a blast!!!!
The security guards attacked my cousin and left him unconscious. They caught him with a flask and when they asked him to leave. Being a sweet guy that he is, he was completely compliant.  My family and I saw them drag him to the elevator and choke him till the point of unconsciousness.  We will never forget his face. It was so traumatizing! Please, do not go to marquee! It is not safe! This happened to us and it can happen to anybody else. This place is DANGEROUS
Does a person have to be dead in order for justice to take place when a homophobic hate crime occurs?. . Over President's Day weekend, I went to a nightclub in Las Vegas, Nevada with my cousins.  On the evening of February 17th I was brutally assaulted and threatened by the security guards of Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  This is my account of what happened in its entirety, the police are not helping me, and did not provide me with an official copy of a notarized police report.  I do not know what to do and hope that justice can be served through the local news stations to gain awareness.. . On February 17th between the hours of 11:45 P.M. to 12:15 A.M., Mr. Nguyen was a visiting patron of Marquee nightclub of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Mr. Nguyen was asked to leave when a Marquee security guard noticed a flask on him.  The guard was African American 5'6", with short curly black hair and a wide forehead.  Mr. Nguyen was compliant and attempted to leave Marquee with his cousins, however, the security guard did not allow Mr. Nguyen's cousins to leave with him.  The security guard called for "Elevator 4" to be ready, as well as "backup."  Mr. Nguyen was violently thrown into the elevator with four additional security guards - all were tall, Caucasian males, over 6-feet with shaved heads and beards.  As the elevator door closed, Mr. Nguyen yelled for his cousins to call for help and call 911.  When the elevator doors closed, Mr. Nguyen was choked and threatened by the security guards.  The security guards repeatedly said to Mr. Nguyen "You are a fag that likes to be choked," and "I am going to give it to you in the ass and that you are going to like it." They also said that Mr. Nguyen wouldn't remember anything after they were done with him.  The guards took turns beating Mr. Nguyen until he became light-headed and lost consciousness.  After some time, the same group of guards woke Mr. Nguyen.  Mr. Nguyen had been carried to the ground floor of the The Cosmopolitan and his face was covered in blood, Mr. Nguyen had a red ring around his throat from being choked and there was blood on the floor around him.  The guards wiped blood off of his face and asked Mr. Nguyen if he remembered anything.  The guards asked Mr. Nguyen why he was in the corner of the hotel and said that they would call their paramedics.  Mr. Nguyen was fearful of being beaten again, so he communicated that he did not recall anything.  The guards took Mr. Nguyen's identification card and spent approximately 15 minutes writing down all of his information including his current home address. Mr. Nguyen returned to meet his cousins and attempted to file a formal complaint and police report.  The Las Vegas PD replied that there was nothing they could do because there is no evidence, even though there were security cameras in the elevator and hotel.  The Las Vegas PD officer said that Mr. Nguyen could have been responsible for his own injuries.. . Please help me by making this story known to the general public.  There cannot be injustice like this in the world and no consequences for such hateful acts of violence.
Marquee security guards-I can't believe you would gang up on a SOBER friend of mine (all 6 of you at once), shove him into an elevator (not allowing anyone else to come in, of course) and choke him til he lost consciousness.  We have the blood from that night to prove what you did.. . Please stay away from this place, as the violent security guards are enough for me to put this on my banned list.
Wow, Wow, Wow. I was lucky enough to get in for free but this club is worth every penny. There is like 3 different levels and the headliners are always top notch. I came here to see porter robinson the other night and enjoyed my night to the greatest extent. The pool is such a cool outdoor area and great to catch a breath from the indoors even though the air conditioning works very well. The Main stage is one of the coolest I've ever seen. Can't wait to be back next time I'm in vegas
Marquee is always fun but my last visit was very short lived. The stairs are usually a pain in the ass when I'm wearing 5 inch heels, but this last time we went we were escorted through the elevators and was even offered a free table. We started off the night with free drinks and then took some photo-booth pictures. I was dead sober while my friends were chilling so I decided to smoke a joint. Yea, it was stupid, but also hilarious. I was promptly kicked out 10 minutes later. The big bouncer guy made sure to really X-out my stamp. But he was super nice and kept telling me he was "on my side" and it was protocol since I was "already reported." Whatever. So we bounced over to Haze and had even more fun throwing money over the balcony with a table of "doctors" while Pauly D was spinning some sh*t. Successful trip. HA.
Went on a Saturday night in January. The line wasn't ridiculously long but long enough that I was happy we were in the guest list line, we probably waited no more than 15 mins.. . As this place is "dress to impress" make sure your clothing is on point, especially your shoe game fellas. As for me, I was decked out in the typical Vegas attire, short dress & high heels, brutal! I was dreading the formidable stair climb that a lot of other reviews highlighted but was able to bypass that whole debacle by taking a nice, comfy elevator ride up! I was thanking my lucky stars and happier my feet were still holding it down while parading about on 4 inches of hell. Seriously guys, it's TORTURE.. . Bitching aside, I was enamored with the outdoor area of Marquee. The space, lighting and music was all very Vegas-ish. The crowd that night wasn't rowdy and a fairly good mix of people. Drinks showcase your typical Vegas price tags as to be expected, I think 5 drinks were around $60-$65. If that's too steep for you, you can always pre-party in your hotel room which usually proves to be entertaining and a hell of a lot cheaper.. . I can't say much for the inside of the venue as I spent the majority of my time outside. BTW although it was January, oddly enough I didn't find myself freezing - thank you global warming! Another key piece of info: if you don't get a table/bottle service you can find some place to semi-sit along the ledges of planters.. Hey, ballin' on a budget - do what you gotta do.. . Anyway, after a couple of hours my feet couldn't take the pain and were redlining the brink of "Hammer Toe" look in the morning. So, to  hell with looking super, super cute, I busted out my flip flops and was a happy camper and more importantly prevented the ill-fated blister foot. Besides, there were plenty of other girls who were happily dancing in their flip flops too.. . What else makes this a great option for a nightclub? Well, Secret Pizza of course. That's where the real party is at! I'll see you there, in flip flops and all.
