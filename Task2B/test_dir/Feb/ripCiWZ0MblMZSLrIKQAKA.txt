Good price, good hotel!clean and welcoming in a great location!If it weren't for that nasty garbage truck at 5 AM in the morning, I would give a 5 star!
We just returned from a long weekend in Las Vegas and our hotel of choice was the Monte Carlo.  Overall, not a bad choice given the deal that we purchased through Hawaiian airlines (room was less than $100 a night and came with a $60/day credit to be used for food). The Buffet isn't the best eating establishment by a long shot, BUT it is free with the stay. I had to keep reminding myself of this fact when some of the food on the bar literally looked inedible.  . . The room was quite comfortable, although quite dated.  Even though we had requested a room with a king-sized bed, a room with two queen beds was available for early check in at 9am at NO additional cost (the King was NOT)...... sign me up for two queen beds please.. . The beds were great and my wife especially loved the pillows (would love to find out where one can buy these).. . There's a thermostat in the room so adjusting the temperature to a more comfortable level was extremely easy.. . The shower was good, yet the water (to me) didn't quite get hot enough, but my wife was happy with its temperature. . . Very quiet considering the age of the hotel and the number of guests it accommodates.. . The Casino itself was VERY small in comparison to other casinos throughout the strip.  Limited gaming tables with manageable limits.  The Paigow tables were rarely below a $25 per hand minimum and there was a very noticeable lack of other gaming options for the frugal gambler.  Hell, it might have just been because it was the weekend.. . There were two (2) Starbucks in the hotel, one right outside of the room elevators, and the second in the mall on the way to the tram station. . . The tram station is a great convenience if you want to go to the Bellagio, Aria, Crystals or The Vdara hotels.  . . SUPER SMOKY !!!! This is to be expected in older hotel/casinos that don't have updated ventilation systems.  Surprisingly, there ARE seven (7) hotels in Vegas that are smoke-free.. . Overall, it's great option if you're looking for a moderately priced hotel on the strip.
I rarely write reviews and try to find positive things about places but couldn't here. Don't stay here. Paper thin walls and window. In 31 floor and can hear freeway, something sounding like a leaf blower, cat alarm, airplanes, and hear both neighbors.  Been to several hotels here and have never had this problem. Bed feels like it's made of wood, shower sprays everywhere, and faucet looks like it's starting to rust. Yeah glad I'm an MLife member and didn't have to pay the full price of over $300 a night. Still not worth what I had to pay. Would not recommend. Waste of money. . . Don't want to give it any stars but had to
Yuck. I made a poor choice when choosing between a suite here, or a regular room at a nicer hotel. Sparse, dark, dirty and left a lot to be desired. Bed was uncomfortable, pillows were awful. Big black hair ball under the sheets was quite off putting. No soap in the bathroom. It may have been over 600 square feet but it didn't make up for anything. Blah. On the plus side, this is a steal for a room right in the middle of the strip.
Stayed 2 nights, Feb 5th & 6th.  Check is was fine, a pleasant greeter named Ricky was nice to everyone chatting them up as they waited then directly us to the next open front desk attendant.  . . Had asked for a king bed but was told they were not guaranteed...umm..ok..whatever, just need a room.  Was asked if I wanted to change the next night and I said yes.  . . The comments that the place is a bit run down are spot on.  Almost everything has signs of being used and abused.  Walls are super thin...thought I was hearing things in the morning but I wasn't....could totally hear a guy taking a pee....that took forever.   LOL!  . . 2nd night I moved to the king bedroom which had a nice layout but again...everything looked worn.  Each light shade near the bed were broken and the shower faucet leaked.  . . I did like the fact that the inter hotel tram was a fast way to get to the Belagio and the staff was very friendly.. . If you want modern and nice this is not the place.  Try the Aria...heard nice things about it.
7th visit to vegas first time staying here . For the price and location I would stay here again
We wanted to stay on the strip but for a decent price. The best price for hotel and location was The Monte Carlo. We stayed 2 nights on a weekend and it was $236 including tax and resort fees. I think it was around $90 per night before fees etc.. . We found a parking spot in the small lot right outside of the lobby. They have a parking structure too but definitely check the small one first! We were advised to move it to the structure but it was free parking anyway and we assumed right that no one would check. . . On check in, we were offered a high floor with a strip view .. AWESOME! And it got better fast. We were told we had $75 to spend on food/drink at 'THE PUB', the bar in the Monte Carlo. We ate there twice, for free! Can't beat that price. . . Okay, the room. Definitely not as nice as newer hotels, but it wasn't not nice. The only major problem - no fridge in the room. Something which is pretty standard i feel like? . . Also, we put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and housekeeping still knocked numerous times. WHY DO THEY DO THIS IN EVERY HOTEL?. Seriously? It's Vegas, the city that never sleeps. I'm not in bed at a reasonable hour, so don't disturb me early morning - ESPECIALLY when the SIGN is on the door! . . Oh and the water pressure in the shower was LAME. Why is it so hard to find a nice shower. . . I'd stay again! But in summer, so we can check out the lazy river!
Hit or miss kind of hotel yet I always come back because the price is right. They always always always have deals or coupon codes for 20% off rooms or some sort of food and beverage credit. Since I'm not one to stay in my room too much in Vegas, I don't mind that it's pretty much a standard hotel. It's definitely no Paris, Venetian, Bellagio or Caesars but, the price is right and it's a place to crash! . . Typically it's my husband and I who stay here and we especially like that there's a food court with variety inside the hotel for that late night snack or morning when you don't want to hit the buffet. We're not big on eating out heavy meals in Vegas so this spot is perfect for us. Grab a bite and get on our way. . . Gambling is great at this casino as well, you can typically always find a $5 table and the slots seem pretty loose. . . I'm starting to realize I'm sounding like a real cheapo! BUT we all kn ow Vegas can get crazy expensive. I prefer to spend my $$$ on the shows, clubs and bars :)
I would totally stay here again!! I contacted guest services by email and told them what we were celebrating and we got a free upgrade to a spa room! Let me tell u it was amazing!!! Next time we go we will pay the extra to be in the spa room! Everyone was so nice and helped anyway they can and the cool thing is they give free craps lessons everyday so we learned how to play! Only complaint was housekeeping walks into your room even with the privacy sign on door! But other than great it was a great stay!
Just arrived home from my 4 day/3 night birthday trip at the Monte Carlo. This was my third time in Vegas, but the first time in this hotel. We walked up to the check-in and we mentioned that it was my birthday and they upgraded us to a high floor strip-view room which honestly was a great way to start off the trip. I immediately dropped off my bags and ran to the window to watch the strip/people. You can see some pretty interesting bits going on if you pay attention close enough downstairs.. . That was the first great thing that happened. The second thing which was cool was the room credit. We booked this room specifically for the birthday promo on their website which included 2-for-1 drinks at Big Chill and free select domestic beer at The Pub. They ended up not having any of the coupons for Big Chill prepared so they comped us $50 in dining credit for wherever we decided to go in the hotel. Cool, thanks! We enjoyed quite a few drinks at the bar during happy hour, and didn't have to worry about the cost of drinks on my birthday. Can't complain.. . The BMG, which I didn't get to see, looked pretty interesting but I've heard the shows were just okay. The pricing was about 40% off for MC hotel guests if you wanted to go. I didn't make it this time, but maybe next time I'll try and catch their show. They have a nightly procession through the lobby at 6:15 which showcases some of their contraptions: a drum that moves itself and a lot of bright lights and sounds. I heard the show was just okay but I'll never know for sure. . . The casino was considerably smaller compared to the Aria, MGM Grand, etc. There also isn't a lot of waitresses walking around taking drink orders which is why I spent most of time at Aria. I sat at their computer roulette tables and got about 4-5 drinks during the hour - hour and a half. I was lucky if I got ONE at the MC. . . Their food court has a Mickey D's (what I call the McDonald's), Sbarro, Subway, Original Chicken Tenders, and Nathan's (I think). The line was super long for MCD's which I got one night when it was late and I didn't feel like walking the strip looking for food and I've had some....a lot of drinks. . . You can take the tram to Aria, Bellagio, Crystals, and I also think Cosmopolitan. I used this quite often to go around to all the hotels and take some shortcuts. . . Okay so in conclusion to my review I will say this and then press the "post" button and hope I made no spelling errors. The hotel was in a nice location, easy access to other hotels, The Pub was a quick happy hour stop, and the beds were comfortable enough for me. I loved the view I got but if I had not gotten the strip view it probably would have sucked, but I got what I paid for. The hotel seems a bit run down as far as decor goes, there's a lot of faded-ish looking gold and brown tones and the walls are thin. I could hear what my neighbors were listening to at all hours. The price was good for what we got: location, location, location. . . P.S. I really hope they get free wi-fi past the first two floors for their guests.
Everytime I wanted to catch the tram to the Bellagio, I've always walked through in here.. . Overall, everything, including the shopping area in the back which lead to the tram, looked okay.
I stayed here on a work trip. The clock in my room is stuck on Chicago time, my tub is leaking and there is no wifi (how is that even possible!!?). Also, they add $20 to your room bill every day for coffee and water. I wouldn't stay here again.
My fiance and I stayed at the Monte Carlo in 2012 and enjoyed the hotel for the short time we were there. . . The registration process was very nice and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and upgraded our room for us. We had an amazing view of the pool area. . . The room was nice and clean. The air conditioning worked well. The pool area looked amazing, however we didn't get to use it. Our trip was cut short due to a death in the family, and we had to check out in a hurry. The Monte Carlo was incredibly nice and reimbursed us for the nights that we didn't stay. I thought that was really cool of them because a lot of places (especially when you book through hotels.com) won't do refunds.. . The Pub in the casino has  good food in the $$ price range. . . The location was great because it was close to everything we like to do. . . ***We stayed again in the summer of 2013 and this time we got to use the pool.  There is a regular pool and hot tub, a wave pool, and a lazy river.  I have to say, the lazy river is awesome!!! The pool has a great environment, fun with music and a good vibe.  The drinks are a little on the pricey side but the tube rental was cheap and there are plenty of chairs.
It's just alright.  No bells or whistles.  I haven't stayed here in years, and since then they've remodeled.  But the pub doesn't brew their own beer anymore!  Boo!  Nice that it still has a tram that connects you to Aria, Crystals and Bellagio.  Convenient, but wish it covered the whole end of this side of the strip.  Summer at the check in desk was great- got us a view and printed my gaming cards for us.
Nice rooms & very helpful staff. When we checked in the lady was very accommodating. Our room wasn't ready but she gave us our keys & a map & asked for our number. They sent a txt with our room number as soon as it was ready. I loved it here.
I'm ONLY giving them a one star because they have a food court in the hotel which includes Starbucks, McDonalds, Sbarro's and other little restaurants.  The casino was decent and not too crowded.  As for the rooms it was not what I expected at all! Now I understand why the rooms were pretty cheap is because they look pretty cheap.  The bathroom itself looked so grungy and dirty that I almost didn't want to shower in them. The room looked dirty when first walking in.  It's liked the cleaning service just vaccumed for a minute and then they were done.  The reason I know this hotel was not very clean to any standard is because the day we left my brother got bed bug bites all over his body!!!!!!!!!! Not just a couple but more than 50!! This just disgusts me for a Vegas hotel on the strip to give somebody bed bug bites and rashes all over! This hotel needs to be inspected from inside and out for bacteria, bites, mold, and so much more!. . I am not a happy customer and will never be going back to this hotel again!
I visited last summer and for the price, it was worth the stay. The room, from what I can recall, was very clean. I had no complaints with it. The main reason we decided on staying at this resort is because it was in the center of the strip which was perfect. I hadn't been to Vegas since I was 10 years old, so to me, I thought this hotel was nice and the price was perfect, only paid about $70 a night. I can't remember the name of one of their restaurants(it was Italian), but the food was delicious. Compared to the other hotels, I thought their casino was the least smokey. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would even come back myself.
I did not enjoy this hotel. Where to begin? We arrived into town around 1:00 and called to see if we could check in early (check in time was 3:00). We were told it would cost an extra $20. Let the nickel-and-diming begin. We opted not to check in early and when we finally did make it to our room we were unimpressed. It was no better than any low-end hotel room. The fixtures in the bath tub were loose and the cold water dripped after turning the faucet off. The attendant handed us a pamphlet at check in listing the amenities at the hotel. We were excited that Keurig coffee makers were included in the room as part of the resort fee (we had seen this listed elsewhere as well). We did not find a Keurig in the room, but a cheap coffee maker with cheap coffee. We called the front desk to find out why our room did not have a Keurig, and were told they didn't have them any more. After expressing displeasure at the false advertising, they agreed to refund one night's resort fee. We wouldn't be using any of the other amenities. Also, the pool looked awesome but was closed for the season. The temps were in the mid-70s and pools at other hotels were open. Another disappointment. . . When I tried to turn on the television with the remote, nothing happened. I found that the TV was unplugged, but plugging it back in did not help matters, although I was able to turn it on with the buttons on the TV itself. The front desk sent someone up with a new remote, but that one didn't work either. They promised to send up a technician "right away", which didn't happen. A little while later someone called the room to find out if the television had been fixed, and they also promised to send someone "right away." Hours later, the TV did get fixed while we were away from the room. Also, when I tried to plug in two electronic devices, one of the outlets would not accept the plug. No idea what that was about.. . Now for the positives. They had great customer services. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. It's in a good location with convenient dining options. Blue Man Group promotions are everywhere, and you're confronted with loud advertisements every time you enter the elevator. They do have a fun parade every evening that storms through the casino. The rooms were acceptably clean and the beds were comfortable. We stayed here because the price was right, but next time I'd choose a different hotel.
Decently priced place tostay at on the strip. However, the person who helped us check in could use some brushing up on customer service skills. We got to the hotel at around 11:00 pm, and they had a long line but I don't see this as valid for not being thorough on explaining the charges that were gonna be placed on my credit card, or offer additional help for our stay. . . The rooms were clean enough, and you get two free water bottles a day due to the resort fee you pay. So I'd contemplate staying here again, but it's not my first choice. . . Tip: There's a walkway that leads to Aria if you can follow the signs from the food court, so that was convenient.. . P.s. the walls are sorta thin, so we can hear the people next to us going at it.
We had a last minute trip to Vegas the weekend before xmas. Got the room for $49 plus tax& resort fees off Priceline mystery 4 star hotel. 2 queen standard facing strip.. The hotel was surprisingly packed checking in around 10pm. . As soon as we got to the room, it was decent and seemingly clean but definitely old and worn. (old furniture, carpet stains etc). I immediately checked the beds and there was a nasty brown stain near the foot of the bed. Luckily on our way to the room we passed a housekeeping cart so hubby asked for new sheets. (which also had faded stains, but way better than the brown stuff). The bathroom was ok, water pressure fine, clean to not be grossed out, but def. not soaking in the tub clean. The towels were dingy and had holes. But hey I paid under $100! (I wouldn't pay over that). Great location on the strip! By NY NY, MGM, planet hollywood, Aria etc. There's a tram to bellagio/ aria which is a plus. . If you park on the 2nd floor, you can go directly to hotel entrance faster. However, if you have a stroller you have to take the elevator back down. The elevator from parking garage is tiny so you might have to wait for it to go back. I like that you don't have to go through the casino to get to your room (toddler in mind) There's a food court (which we didn't try) . Walls are a bit thin + VERY loud neighbors, coming back from clubbing and partying in the room until 6am (could hear their entire conversation, including a fight) Next morning baby was up so WE made a lot of noise (knowing said neighbors were probably sleeping lol) It was too cold for the pool, but heard it has a lazy river.. This would not be my first choice unless you are on a budget and want to be on the strip.
Ok, this place is a toss up.  The hotel rooms are cheap, you can't stay at your local holiday inn for the price here.  With that being said this place is a great value for what you're paying.  The rooms are average, nothing special, same with the casino and buffet.  The location is greedy, easy walk to several casinos, fairly centrally located on the strip.  We left the casino during the day and only returned to the Monte Carlo to sleep.  They gave great customer service at the front desk, if you're gambling, DONT expect to get a drink.  The ONLY was we got any drinks here were walking up to the bar and playing the slots there, and we only got one after the bartender decided to come over and ask us if we wanted anything which took awhile.  But all in all this place is one of the best places to stay for the value!!!  It is not a bad hotel by any means.
The staff is great---except for the Supervisor Ryan at the front desk. This guy is single-handedly destroying the economy of this hotel, and the owner, board of directors, and visitors must know. . . We came here, and we were disappointed with the room. We came in, and the lamp shades were bent and lopsided. It was as if the lamps hit the floor, and housekeeping didn't care about it. They just put the lopsided bent and broken shades as if it weren't a big deal. . . The towels were wrinkled, and the carpet was so nasty you could see the build up of dirt along the corners. . . When you combine the fact that the plumbing fixtures were brassy-old rejects from the eighties, the whole experience is truly depressing. . . We went to the front desk to get an upgrade. (The suite upgrade is truly worth it. Pay an extra $40 a night to get a suite. I have to say it was worth it, and I'd gladly pay more). . . Stephanie really worked hard to make us happy---she worked hard to put together the upgrade. Unfortunately, the supervisor Ryan ruined everything. After Stephanie said the upgrade will be at no charge, we were delighted. She said come back in 2 hours. . . When we did, Ryan said we owed money for the upgrade. I have no problem with that, but when the other representative said there was no charge: Now we have a problem. It's not about money. Now it's about integrity. Now it's about doing what you say.  Ryan argued, and he said that we were wrong. At this point, we just wanted to go to our room: We were exhausted--- whatever just charge us. I've never dealt with someone that was so difficult. . . This guy should not be dealing with customers. Ryan's philosophy is: The customer is wrong. . . Thankfully, the brilliant and awesome staff at their Hotel 32 is incredible! Housekeeping is great, the concierge staff is wonderful! I really appreciate those great people; however, the deplorable treatment from Ryan turned us off to the Monte Carlo.. . The ownership must know that Ryan is a liability. He should not be interacting with hotel guests. The only thing he should supervise is the Buffett.  . . I say to the ownership: "Send in secret shoppers; this guy is sinking your business. If you want to lose a fortune. Ryan is for you". . . To potential guests: Stay away unless you get a suite at Monte Carlo. Go to the Bellagio or Caesar's Palace.
Used to stay here often. Was always very happy. But the service has really gone downhill. . . I stayed here last year and had some problems with the pool staff, but not a big deal. I filled out their survey and asked to be contacted. Never was contacted.. . Decided to give them another chance. Booked a trip with my wife for valentines day. Requested a king bed. Upon check in, we were told none were available. Said they would contact me the next morning to switch rooms. 4pm comes the next day and still no call. I check with the front desk. They said again none available. I said I would pay for an upgrade or willing to switch hotels. Again they said they would contact me. Still no call. Stayed all weekend with small bed and no call. Again not that big of a deal, but enough to be annoyed. . . Upon coming home, I got another survey. Again I filled it out and asked to be contacted. Over one week later and still no contact. Why ask to be contacted and send surveys if they won't read them? Maybe they will read this yelp review. Last time I stay or gamble at Monte Carlo.
ehhh, Monte Carlo is just whatever. The room itself was nice and had a good view but the bathroom needs some updating, especially the fixtures. We stayed here because of the price and location on the strip but thats about all it had going for it. Wish there were better restaurants there as well. Only real issue I had was with the room keys. I had to get new keys 4 times over a 2 day span since they kept on deactivating. That got pretty annoying but I didn't feel like complaining and all that. Wont stay here again unless it is by far the cheapest out of the all the rest of the hotels.
Stayed here back in December 2013. The price for the room that weekend was pretty affordable since they were having some sort of construction outside. I was a bit worried that I would be awoken in the morning due to the noise but to my surprise there was none. The room needs to be remodeled though for sure. I wish it had a better tv and better phone reception. The colors are funky too. The hotel location was very convenient though which was a great plus for us that rainy weekend. We were able to take the tram and get to other hotels such as Vdara with no trouble at all. I wouldn't mind staying here again because it was very convenient and affordable. There was plenty of gambling options downstairs as well.
Weekend buffet: grossly expensive, yet possibly the worst in town. Any average clueless bachelor can cook half-decent salmon--but not these clowns. Hard and dry through and through, like pieces of compressed pink fiber insulation. They actually made a clunking sound when dropped on a plate. Unbelievable and laughable. This place isn't even trying.
If I could give this hotel no stars, I would. . . I will never stay here again. My poor boyfriend got contact dermatitis all over his body from this hotel. When addressing this issue to the hotel manager, the manager offered no apology and implied it was his fault for not requesting hypoallergenic sheets. My boyfriend has stayed in tons of hotels--good and bad. Never has this been an issue nor has he ever had allergies, so why would he ever request for hypoallergenic sheets? Aside from Monte Carlo being run down, management handled this issue very poorly.
One of the older hotels. NO WIFI in the rooms!! The patrons were on their laptops and phones in the lobby. In today's digital world, not having WIFI is a deal breaker in my opinion. The decor in the rooms, bathrooms were quite outdated. The breakfast buffet was ok. Tram to neighboring hotels such as Cosmopolitan. Part of the myVegas slot app game so you can get rooms for free. If you had to pay, I would try other establishments.
C'mon guys!  Millions of dollars is pumped into this place but you cannot afford to supply your customers with WIFI in their rooms?  What year are we in?  Cheap mofos.. . And what's up with your crazy ass shower heads?  Feel like I just walked out of an F5 tornado.
