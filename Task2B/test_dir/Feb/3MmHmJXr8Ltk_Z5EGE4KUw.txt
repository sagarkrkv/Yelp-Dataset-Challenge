OMG, BEST STEAK HOUSE EVER! I have been to a lot of different steak houses but this was by far one of the best. Service is spectacular, food is incredible wine list is extensive. . . We took our customer there for dinner, there was 12 of us and they took really good care of us. I had the bone in ribeye medium rare, you could cut it with a fork. . . I am not sure what else to say, go if you have a chance.
ok we tried Carnevino again - will not be a third time . nothing has changed. over rated. over priced. worst service I have seen in years. steak was over cooked. seafood was over cooked. pasta was under cooked. vegetables were mush. and no seemed to care about it . I guess the don't care about repeat business
Everything was amazing. The ribeye for one is not in the menu but is worth asking for. The potatoes were done perfectly. The rendered bacon fat butter was so good I contemplated putting it on the table. Great wine selection.
I am frankly shocked that Carevino does not get 5 stars here. It is not cheap, but everything else is practically perfect. Maybe I can see some detractors on atmosphere. if you sit out in the middle of the big room, but if you get a booth on the side it is pretty cool. But anyway, you go here for steak and the porterhouse for two that I split with my pal Reed was the best steak I have had in years. Simply prepared, nice and rare. My favorite part of the meal was the octopus appetizer --- worth the price of the meal on its own. And the piece de resistance was the Ramones blasting the dining room. Great company, phenomenal red meat, punk rock --- a sensory orgasm!
Overrated is being kind. We find Carnevino grossly overrated, ridiculously overpriced, and completely underwhelming.. . On second thought: we found it insulting.. . We were in town for a weekend with couple friends, wanted elegant Italian, and got a strong recommendation from a local (cab driver).. . Wine list, for which this place is famous, is absurdly pricey. Almost nothing under $100. (We got the "last bottle"of a very average Tuscan blend, $65.). . Our wives split a thick-cut pork chop ($46). Forty-six dollars for one, unadorned chop served without sides or sauce. (Sauces for all meats run an extra $7. Yes - you pay extra for sauce.. . The chop was unpalatably dry and reeked of cloves. . . I had a passable Osso Buco ($41) served on a paltry bed of flavorless risotto. . . My buddy had a seafood pasta, best entree of the three. . . Tab for three salads, three entrees, one side dish and one bottle of wine: $300. . . I expect to pay top dollar for top-quality dining. This was grossly overpriced, utter mediocrity. . . Mario Batali ought to be ashamed.
What a disappointment! . . I was wondering if I should write a review because I work in the restaurant industry and don't like writing negative reviews but I couldn't help it! . . In short:. . Very overpriced, ($1200 for 5 people. And we didn't even splurge on great wine). . Wines very overpriced! . . Food nothing special, with small exceptions, but it should have been great across the board given the prices!. . Our server was great! . . However, I can't say the same of the sommelier. He was not very helpful, with zero personality, an he didn't seem to care. I am a sommelier myself but wanted his input because I wasn't familiar with majority of Italian wines on the menu and wanted to find a good one. I took his recommendation and ordered a wine that appeared to be flat or little off. I kindly asked for the sommelier. I wanted him to taste it and tell me if this is the way is supposed to taste. I hate sending wine back, but it really wasn't pleasant and it was a $170 bottle. Someone else came, it might have been the manager. He tasted the wine and said unfortunately this is the way it's supposed to taste and basically told me that this is what I get for this price ($170) as if I ordered a cheap wine!!!! O well, it's true, it was on the "cheaper" side on their wine list. . . So I had to keep the wine! Any respectable restaurant would have taken it back!  This is what I do in my restaurant and I believe this a restaurant norm. Or at least this is the norm in the good fine dining restaurants! . . I will never return, and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. But I don't think they would care. They get plenty of tourist traffic and probably don't care for returning customers.
This is one of the best restaurants ever.  The food is great and the quality of service was superb.  As soon as we check in everyone was so attentive to our needs including checking on us throughout our dining experience.  Our waiter also took the time to explain the food, the cut of each part of the bone rib eye and part of their aging process.. . On to the food.  We ordered arugula salad, Beef cheek ravioli (I believe this was a special for that night), Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye with mash potato and spinach side.  We enjoyed every dish we ordered.  The only dish that we thought was average was the spinach side dish.  The arugula salad was a great mix of arugula, pickled onions, very creamy goat cheese and mushroom - the mix was very refreshing and went well together.  The beef cheek ravioli was also superb.  It had great taste like a very good pate.  We ordered a medium cooked rib eye and it was just cooked perfectly.  Red in the middle and not bloody - red and warm middle vs. of red and cold middle.. . I wish we had room for desert unfortunately we were too full to order any.  But overall we enjoyed our dining experience and would eat here again.
I came to carnevino this past Saturday with a group of friends (8 in all).  We all enjoy great food and wine and don't mind paying for it, which you will certainly have to do here. . . We shared a lot of food family style. Arugula and chopped salad were both excellent. The arugula salad has some type of pickled onions in it, making it super tasty. We had the grilled octopus, which was cooked absolutely perfectly, steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. All the apps were spot on. . . We shared 4 pastas for 8 of us and they were all good. The spaghetti frutti di Mare was fantastic. All the others, I felt, were too similar and not adequate enough in portion. Ifeel like a little bit more of them would have been more suitable. . . Then, we shared entrees. We had the lamb, which I didn't try but looked good, the porterhouse (amazing!), the salmon (which I found a little boring), the BBL New York (out of this world taste - so super herbaceous and so intense), Brussels sprouts (love the simple preparation). . . In terms of service... Hmmm. I'm torn. Our front service seemed absolutely ambivalent about his work there. He did a good job, but kinda seemed "over it."  The back waiter, on the other hand, was super nice. We were in one of the side rooms, which was a little disappointing because you want to be in the middle of the action. We had 4 bottles of wine for the table and both were a great pairing with the food. . . One last note: in the middle of the waiter's initial menu spiel, I accidentally spilled my $15 glass of wine that I got from the bar.  The waiter didn't refill it. It's subtle, and it isn't that we were in any way lacking for food or wine, but when you're spending $170/person to eat (which is what our bill came out to), I would expect that service point to be paid attention to.
Visited Carnevino for the second time last week.  After a five star experience on my first visit last year, was so excited to come back this year.  There will not be a third visit.  Such a poor experience due to the staff that this is my first yelp review.  The quick details are that five of us ate family style, which ended up costing $250 per person. We split Tartar (ok), Ravioli (great), Rib eye (ok), Short Rib (good) and a "pay by the inch steak" (which was one of the more impressive steaks I have ever had).  . . Now to the bad.  We ordered three bottles of wine.  A white ($120), a barbaresco ($160) and 2005 brunello ($170) that the Somm recommended to go with the steak and short rib.   The white was fine, the barberesco was great, but the brunello was flat.  My girlfriend, who happens to be a certified Somm, asked the manager to taste the wine to see if he thought it was flat.  He responded by saying, " you get what you pay for."  . . The second issue was with the pay by the inch steak.  It was wonderful and my mouth is watering a little bit just thinking about it.  Problem is, I didn't get to finish it.  The bus boy decided to clear the plates on his schedule.  I lost an inch and a half and some short rib on my plate.  He also cleared the center plate that had two slices of the steak left.  Terrible.  Didn't even ask the table if he should clear.. . Carnevino will not get repeat traffic from me.  There are way too many great steakhouses in Vegas to ever eat there again.  For those who had read this far, try Sage at Aria.  Wonderful.  . . Finally, shared our experience with friends back in LA.  They had similar stories.  Good food, bad experience.  . . Come on Mario -- Step it up!
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. . One statement...we got sick eating here. . . We ordered 3 of their "top" choices for steaks including their "signature 9 month dry aged" steak, and ended up getting sick. . . While that is enough to earn one star, how they handled the issue is even worse. When I approached the restaurant to inform them that their food caused my entire party to get sick, they appeared to show genuine concern and said they would report the incident and have someone contact me. ONE MONTH LATER, I finally get in touch with their LIABILITIES department who informs me that they do not see anything was done wrong so nothing will be done. . . Upon retrospect, they do this to MAKE YOU GO AWAY. So...to all Yelpers...take their advice and STAY AWAY. . . We blew well over a grand at this place and for what....sickness, poor customer service, and severe disappointment. . . Save yourself the trouble...
Best steak EVER!!!  Yes, it was pricey, but so worth it!  We ordered the only thing on the menu that should be ordered - the aged bone-in ribeye.  Side dishes - who cares.  We had the butternut squash rissoto and it was nothing to write home about.  The dinner comes with bread and two kinds of butter - butter and butter with fat and the fat is good!  There are sauces you can choose to add on to the steak, i.e. truffle sauce, etc.  We did not do that, the steak was amazing on its own.  They cut up the steak and explained each part to us.  The presentation was nice and the atmosphere was nice.  Wait staff was pleasant and even encouraged me to munch on the bone with my bare hands and YES I did it - some of the best morsels were on that bone.  It was around $75/person and the total bill with wine, side dish, and dessert was $200.00 - not too shabby for a once a year splurge.  There are a lot worse things to spend $200 on.  My husband and I were happy and stuffed.  Definitely going back next year!
I have now been to dinner at Carnevino twice and it does not disappoint.  The meat is perfect and the mashed potatoes with the poached egg are so good that even my husband who does not eat runny eggs loves those potatoes.
Amazing service & the food is the best in the strip.. My new all-time favorite fine dining restaurant. Our server Carlos was very specific about carefully explaining the menu in detail and our back server Michelle was extremely attentive & made sure we had everything we needed (refills, water, extra utensils, etc).. My husband and I will definitely be coming back very soon! We're obsessed!
I am just going to review the steaks here since the side dishes were not impressive at all.  . . First of all I had the hardest time getting them to serve me the Primera Riserva 240 day dry-aged Ribeye Steak.   The flavor was out of this world.  It tasted like butter, foie gras, and aged cheese all in one bite.  This steak was so good.  However it was so rich.  I would suggest sharing this steak among 2-3 people and ordering other cuts of steak.  But, since I am a steak-freak, I ate it all by myself and loved it.  I will go back in April or August to eat this again.. . I also tried the 90 day dry-aged New York Steak.  This cut was more meaty and was nice.  I like more marbling on my steak, but for those who prefer more meat, then this is the cut for you.  . . Finally, I had the 90 day dry-aged Ribeye Steak.  This steak is for the less adventurous steak eater.  There was nice marbling but less of an intense flavor.  It was nice though.
The best steakhouse in Las Vegas. . . The rib eye riserva is absolutely amazing. I had reservations about american rot beef being used to the amazing cows of Alberta but this was absolutely mind blowing. . Well worth the money for an expertly aged and prepared piece of beef. . . Amazing pasta sides and the lardo/butter bread is sheer opulence.. . Tip: Sit at the bar and chat up the bartenders/bar managers. They always have the power to have some tasty freebies appear in front of you.
Carnevino is INCREDIBLE. I was lucky to dine here for a work dinner, so prices were not of importance (and I'm thankful for that!). It was the first time I had been to a restaurant tied in with a well-known chef and I was not disappointed. I half expected a very standard meal, but was blown away at the quality here.. . The bartenders and servers were very attentive and quick to help out. Also, happy to customize for you. We had a few that ordered martini's with special requests. I opted for an extra dirty martini, which was delicious.. . I could have dined on the Shrimp "Alla Diavolo" appetizer alone. The spice and tomato flavors matched perfectly with the huge shrimp. SO delicious. The oysters were equally delicious.. . I had a tough time at dinner. I'm very picky about my steak and was unsure, but went for it after all. I ordered it medium plus, and it was just about perfect. But that was not the most memorable part. The person next to me ordered his steak "blue". Not knowing what that was, I gave it a try, and it was heavenly. A crisp char and raw inside reminded me of tuna steak. It's not something I ever imagined I would crave but I still remember the taste and texture to this day!. . Though stuffed, we still opted for dessert (and too many of them). The Chocolate & Peanut Butter Torte was my favorite, as well as the Flourless Chocolate Cake. Great spot!
