My favorite show in Las Vegas so far! I am such a fan of The Beatles, and was excited to check out what the show would be like and how the music would be incorporated. I am happy with how a lot of music was somehow remixed or played throughout the show. . . The whole theater has a "Liverpool" ambiance, with the ushers dressed up in costumes, and every seat is a "good" seat, you can't go wrong where you sit! My favorite acts were "Something", "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" and "Come Together".. . The only downside, not really for me, but for others would be that there is not real story or plot line being followed, so when the show ends, you're left feeling kind of puzzled. But like I said, it's not a big deal if you are a fan of the music or The Beatles themselves.
This show is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! I fell asleep. I don't understand how this show has survived so long, it was a choreographic disaster. No tricks, no stunts, terrible dancing, and boring boring boring. I went with 6 other people and we all HATED IT, including a 10 year old who said it was the worst thing she's ever seen.
What a great show! I surprised my fiance with tickets to this show since it was the one she really wanted to see. While I'm not entirely familiar with ALL of the Beatles music, my fiance is and she definitely enjoyed it. . . To me, it seemed more of a Jabbawockeez-style type of show with all of the dancing/break dancing routines.... Mystere and KA seemed to showcase more of a true high-flying and acrobatics routine that I think Cirque is more known for. . . I was surprised there were a lot of empty seats in the theater... but I believe since February is an off-season for Vegas, I'm sure they do get packed in the summer time like most shows do. . . Our seats were in section 205, row N, seats 4 and 5... our view was great. I'd upload our view, but they prohibit photos of the stage.. . I still had a great time... and so did the guy next to me. So if you're a Beatles fan, book some tickets to come see this show!
This show was good, but I wish it was more cohesive. I love the Beatles and it was cool to go see this show on the Beatles' 50th anniversary of coming to the US. The music was great. The visuals were stunning. The only issue I had with it was there was no story... there was no cohesion.... it was hard to watch for the entirety of the show because it felt like a huge mish mosh of things. Additionally, the songs were acted out literally in many cases, which was not necessary. I did think there were some acts that were far better than others and could have done without some of the less impressive acts with basic dancing... not really what you are expecting from Cirque. Anyway, it certainly wasn't bad, but I don't know that I would recommend it either. One thing is for sure...it was way better than Zarkana.
If you're looking for a family-friendly show and are willing to splurge, then look no further. Locals, make sure you check out the 2 for $99 discount (I think it's on Sundays). This is the ultimate Cirque du Soleil because of the BEATLES music of course. While the other shows have the "exotic background" type music, this one goes all out with the Beatles' catchy tunes. Totally makes the show much more lively and exciting. It's all the typical Cirque stunts but on a much larger scale since it's a HUGE HUGE HUGE space. . . If you want to save money, you really can't go wrong with seats higher up. Since it's such a large-scale show you can really see things from every angle.. . The only downside was, unlike other Cirque shows, there's not much of a pre-show.
Best Cirque in Vegas even if you aren't a Beatles fan.. . I am a Beatles fanatic, and the end of the this show has me in tears every time. I have seen it 6 times now. The costumes and stage sets are jaw dropping. The remix of original Beatles music is inventive and alone worth of a standing ovation. They did a fantastic job of mixing traditional Cirque acrobatics with more modern dance choreography. Very original. . . If you are local, make sure you take advantage of the 2/$99 if you can (if it's still on). It's such a great deal for this show.
Not sure why this show got such rave reviews. I was lucky enough to get a 2 for 1 deal, so I got tickets to see this highly recommended show. I've seen other Cirque shows which did not disappoint- Ovo, Iris, and Totem. Maybe I went to the show with high expectations, but Love definitely did not meet my standards. I didn't understand the story, there were not "circus"-like acts, too much contemporary dancing, and I dozed off here and there. I enjoyed the music, but not the acts. One thing I do remember about the show were the cool lights. I don't recommend paying full price for this show.
So I'm a pretty big Beatles fan....that being said, this show was zzzzz snore fest.  It felt like a ballet meets the Russian Sochi opening games.  Kinda cool. Music was good but your thinking what the hell am I watching?  What's with the bald guy blowing smoke on people?  Didn't know stomp had anything to do with the Beatles... The music was great.  The venue fantastic. The show.... mediocre. . . Go to this show only if it's free. Otherwise go see something else. Like Absinthe or O.
I was going to give this Cirque show 3 stars. 3 STARS!!!  Yep. 5-star K.D. (I give everything 5 stars, everyone who reads my reviews knows this) WAS GOING TO GIVE A CIRQUE SHOW 3 STARS! . . Then I calmed down. . . First, some background about me, I love Cirque shows. No... I have an OBSESSION with Cirque shows. You know those people who watch Star Wars movies a hundred times? Well, I'm like that, except with Cirque shows. I could probably sing-along the entire Ka soundtrack and I don't even know what I'm saying! But I can sing it because I must've heard that soundtrack a hundred times.  . . So... this Beatle's LOVE is a one and done deal for me. I bumped it up to a four stars because I read my Yelpie friends review of the show and they've convinced me it was a good show. Also the bf loved it and he'll kill me if he finds out I gave it 3 stars (it was our Valentines Day gift. Giving LOVE on Valentines, get it? Awwww).  . . Firstly, it's not a Cirque show. Outside of the few aerial acrobats, and the trampoline artists, there are NO acrobatic acts throughout the show. You could say the roller skates act was acrobatic... but c'mon... it wasn't even that good. I bet the local skate park has skaters just as talented who could do cooler tricks. . . It's a lot of dancing! Lots of really cool dancing and special effects. So, if you go in with the mindset of it's a musical, you won't be as disappointed. . . PROTIP: go to the show when you're stoned senseless. No honestly, the acts will make a lot more sense if you're high. The whole thing is like a psychedelic dream episode anyways. You're not suppose to watch it, but FEEL it. As much as I didn't like the show, I want to see it again, stoned. I bet it's fantastic stoned. . . I will say their interpretation of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life. And their Get Back number was cool too. But for $140 for balcony seats for two... I say, pass. There's better shows in town.
DATE: Sunday, February 16, 2014. TIME: 7:00 PM. SECTION: 209. ROW: S. SEATS: 40-41. . The Beatles have been such an impact in my life since childhood. My dad would always turn on the radio every Sunday morning to hear Breakfast with the Beatles and even blast their songs on the cassette player in the car. Growing up listening to themwas like a rite of passage. And now that they have a show in Vegas it has been a dream of mine to finally hear their music live. . . The bf found a great deal on travelzoo.com for $70 each (service fees/taxes already included). It was the best offer since other shows like O, Zumanity and Michael Jackson's One were more than $100. We wanted to stay budget-friendly so it was the ideal choice for us.. . Our seats were all the way in the back but don't be fooled because they were still perfect. The view of the center stage still seemed close and for someone that has a pretty bad astigmatism that means a lot! It really is true--there is no such thing as a bad seat.. . The show promptly started at 7 pm and it was THE best and THE most entertaining 90 minutes that I have got to experience in such a long time. I won't get into specific details because I don't want to ruin it for any that haven't seen it but I will say that it was an incredibly emotional journey through their music. However, my only gripe was the weak story or lack thereof. I'm not sure if that's intentional but it just seemed kind of odd--it wasn't very smooth transitions into the next song--but all-in-all I still enjoyed the music, vibrant colors and dancing.. . I walked into this show with no expectations but to have a great time and I absolutely did!
Absolutely loved the show.  We were in row r. Seats were great.  View was great. The show seemed to play to all the seats. So it didn't seem like any seats were left out.
If you like the Beatles, GO.  If you like Cirque, GO.. . I've seen 6 Cirque shows and this is hands down my favorite.  It's on par with Mystiere.  I do love the Beatles, so I felt it was especially moving -- I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like the Beatles, since the music is such a big piece of the show.. . This show has it all -- music, acrobatics, dance, story line, gorgeous set, daring stunts.  LOVE LOVE.. . By the way, while leaving "O" I heard another guy behind me say he also thought Beatles Love was better.  It's not just me.
This show is an artistic masterpiece. It captures the true essence of the Beatles.  I am an avid theater goer and this show stands up to the best.
