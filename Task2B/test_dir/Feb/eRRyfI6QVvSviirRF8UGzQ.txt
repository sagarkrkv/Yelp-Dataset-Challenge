Stayed here for two nights in January and it really is a gorgeous hotel with great grounds and casinos. . . A little bit out of the action of the rest of the strip for my liking but a short cab journey is only around $10. . . The pool was closed as it was Jan but you can use the Wynn one from 9 to 5pm if you like. . . Look for great deals on travelocity out of season!
I've waited a long time to write this review.  I needed time to forgive the Encore for both their snooty, pretentious check-in staff, spa attendants and pool servers during my stay.  That being said, I've turned the page and am ready to talk.  :-). Pros:. 1.  The rooms without a doubt are 5 stars--the nicest, cleanest and biggest rooms on the strip from a casino hotel.  . 2.  The restaurants are 5 stars--no denying.  . Cons:. 3.  There is no fresh food service by the pool during the week.  They sell expensive food that has been pre-packed and not made to order.  I get that they are watching their bottom line, but aren't we staying at the Encore???  Other hotels have figured it out--seems to me that Steve Wynn should be able to as well.  . 4.  There are lots of tweaky, twenty-somethings running around filling up the day/night clubs--which is fine and would explain the impatient service.  But if that is not your scene, the pool experience is boring and uneventful.  Kind of a waste, actually.  . . I would stay here again for a retreat--to spa and have no scene.  That's not good or bad for me, just is.
Stayed in the Salon Suite in the tower suites area of Encore! It was an incredible experience. The room was huge, with a dining area, massage room, living room, bar area, large bedroom, and an amazing bathroom! . . The check-in desk was in a private and elegant area. We were served bottled water while we waited. An additional hotel rep came to greet us personally and we were given her business card if we needed anything during our stay.. . Our room came with in-room breakfast every morning. At night we would call in our order from a pre-selected menu ( items such as French toast, oatmeal, omelet, eggs/bacon, croissant sandwich, etc), as well as coffee/tea.  In the evenings, we would get turndown service. Slippers were set out, the lights dimmed, chocolates next to the bed, and fresh bottles of water set next to the bed for us. It was wonderful!. . During our stay, we used the salon (and barber shop) and spa, as well as the golf course, saw Le Reve. Every employee was wonderfully accommodating, and so polite. The hotel is so much quieter than the Wynn, and feels much more intimately classy. And it smells so good! I bought the scented oils sold in the Home Store so that I could experience it at home!. . If you can't decide between the Encore and Wynn, you can't lose either way. I personally liked the Encore more, for the fact that it was quieter and more intimate. However, most of all the attractions (shows, golf course, shops, sports book, etc) are at the Wynn, so we did a lot of walking! The Wynn is just as beautiful, the rooms are large and gorgeous, and it is convenient to every want and need you may have.. . But, if I had another choice, it would be Encore! Hope to see you soon!
Like my review of the Wynn, I don't get it.  It's far away from everything.  The casino is one of the smallest on the strip.  It's nice and clean but sterile.  It has no personality.  Being new, I expected more.
Love this place . There really isn't much more to say. All the restaurants and clubs are amazing. XS is  great club if you're looking for class and a great night. The rooms are amazing and the place is incredible. The decor is fantastic as well.
Rooms don't compare to the Venetian/palazzo, I prefer the palazzo. But if you're partying at the Wynn/encore the logistics scream out to stay here.
My wife and I stayed at Encore during Valentine's weekend. Since we drove in from Los Angeles, we appreciated the short walking distancebetween the self parking and the check-in desk. You immediately get the feeling of being at a premiere hotel rather than the typical Vegas casino. Why? Because of the huge windows and natural light Encore utilizes around the casino and restaurant areas. I've noticed that majority of the other hotel/casinos deny guests of natural lighting in (and around) the casino. This is one of the unique differences you will notice.. When it came to the service (check-in, casino, waitresses, cafe, restaurants, housekeeping, buffet, and Le Reve staff), everyone was friendly and professional. For this caliber of hotel, I got the excellent service that I expected. Since I'm not a whale, I didn't expect whale treatment.. My two regrets were not experiencing the spa, or the clubs during my stay. I was satisfied with my experience at Encore enough that I will consider this my first option when returning to Las Vegas. We never felt the need to leave Encore or the Wynn during our visit.
I have stayed at a lot of hotels on the strip, and I was totally surprised to find out that Encore is my favorite. . . The suite we stayed in was stunning- beautiful windows with a strip view, fantastic decor and spotlessly clean. Very well maintained. . . The casino had very little smoke and the clientele was higher class than some of the other casinos (helloooo treasure island). . . The stand out highlight is the spa. Amazing staff- my massage was outstanding. And the facilities are so delightfully decadent it is a crime to skip the chance at spending a whole day here enjoying the facilities. They have a recommended circuit- and everything you could possibly want. Sauna, steam room, great showers, other showers that have light therapy, a wall of copper cups and falling water, two long pools, one cold plunge pool and one cool plunge pool, and my favorite the heat tile lounger chairs. . . It is an oasis. This hotel- in every way is one of the best on the strip and my favorite place to stay in Vegas.
