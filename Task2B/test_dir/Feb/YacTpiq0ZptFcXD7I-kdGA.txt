My now fiance took me here to celebrate after he proposed. I swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. . . Started with delicious Krug champagne and oysters. I really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. . . My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and I should have too. I ended up having a bit of his, it is NOT to be missed. We almost put in another order. . . I ordered the filet and he the bone-in ribeye. Both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye I liked the filet more. It was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. The ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. My man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. Honestly can't say a bad thing about either. . . They sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. . . My fiance and I agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. We will definitely return every time we come to Vegas.
Great service! The staff was professional, attentive, and friendly.  The popovers were very light and delicious. We ordered the wedge salad and lobster bisque as our appetizers. Both were delicious and we were really impressed with the bisque.. . We ordered the bone in rib eye and lobster stuffed with crab. There was nothing impressive about these two dishes. My husband liked to lobster but said the crab mixture had too much mayo (?). My ribeye cut was too fatty and didn't need the butter. I felt like I was eating a rib eye from Paula Dean's kitchen. . . For, dessert, we ordered the macadamia nut bread pudding. Uh, meh, nothing spectacular.  The italian espresso was very good.. . I'm giving this place four stars because the service was really good and I believe the dishes we choose weren't bad, they just didn't please our taste buds.  I would like to give this place another try.
Went here over the past weekend just to try. Have been to other steakhouses like cut, Ruth cris, morels, summit house in Fullerton, and lawrys. Safe to say food was decent considering the price. . . Filet mingnon was tender but good. Not great. I have liked the filet at cut much better. . . Crab legs were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature. . . The lobster bisque was ok too. I think I had expected the greatness I found with McCormick's lobster bisque. Safe to say for the price I would probably go to cut again or lawrys or McCormick. Probably wouldn't want to go back here. Sorry kids. But that's just me.
What better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! It was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   . . Starting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain. . . Next came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers. . . My side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's true colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them. . . Would I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!
Took my fiance here for our 5 year anniversary since he is such a fan of steak.  To be honest, I always felt that if you've been to one steakhouse, you've been to them all.  But that doesn't mean the food was any less delicious.  . . The truffle chips were crunchy and packed with flavor and the salmon tartare was delicious!  We also ordered the bone in filet, which was a little on the salty side but the meat was perfectly tender...but what I was extremely excited about was the foie gras (banned in California).  The order of foie gras was plentiful and just heaven paired with the steak.  . . The service was impeccable, I never once felt forgotten.. . Sigh, I guess I'll need to take that 4 hour drive everytime I'm craving foie gras.....
i had a delicious meal here. i came here a few weeks ago for a business dinner and had a nice experience. i didn't like the wine, but that's my fault, not theirs!. . i ordered a salad of sorts to start, and then i had the bone-in rib eye. normally i find a steakhouse doesn't put a rib eye and a bone-in rib eye on their menu, but for whatever reason, Delmonico's has both. my steak was incredible. it was so juicy and prime. to accompany it, we ordered mashed potatos and also asparagus, both of which were very good.. . also, for dessert, the espresso gelato is a must. the next time i'm in vegas, i'll certainly return to delmonico's.
What an experience!. I made reservations for my friend and I. We had dinner at around 6:30pm on a Sunday. We were seated right away. . . Three servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night. . . Our meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full. . . Both of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it. . . It was an overall pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.
It was a real up and down evening.. Apps - BBQ shrimp were great but there's only 4 of them so don't expect to get filled up.. Entrees - my wife had the filet medallions and they were basically disgusting. They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular.. Sides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them. . Dessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!! . Drinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening. . . The service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak. . In the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon. Maybe eventually, but it'll be a while if we do.
