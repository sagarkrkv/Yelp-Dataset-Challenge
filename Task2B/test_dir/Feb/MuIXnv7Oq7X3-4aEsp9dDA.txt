Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the cocktails flat out suck.. . Food was pretty good, albeit small portions. We had room for dessert and we were not disappointed.. . Service was friendly.
We absolutely LOVED this place! We made reservations through our hotel and were seated very quickly after we got there. Our waiter, Gary, was AMAZING... and I don't use that word frivolously! He was friendly, fun, outgoing and totally made our visit exceptional. Note to other waitstaff - THIS is how you earn a big tip! The offerings on the menu all looked so good so we asked Gary for his recommendations for both our drinks and between a few of the entrees. He was very knowledgable about everything and went into detail about our options, asking us what we liked and making suggestions accordingly. Even though he was obviously very busy, he took the time with us to make sure we got what we were going to love. He even offered to get us new drinks if we didn't like what we ordered.. . Anyway, for food we ordered the meatloaf and side of mac n' cheese to split between my friend and I... per his suggestion that it would be a lot of food. They even split it on two plates for us and it was more than enough food... and I'm a pretty good eater! The meatloaf was absolutely awesome! I really liked the mac n' cheese too but my friend didn't love that it had a kind of spicy salsa topping - but that could be easily omitted. . . Sadly, we were too full (even after splitting an entree!) to order dessert! So bummed we missed out on this since everything looked so good. But we were going out dancing and didn't want to be stuffed.  Can't wait to go back when I'm in Scottsdale again! Thanks Gary and the rest of the nice staff!
I snuck in here with my co-pilot early for Happy Hour. Sat on the patio, Had THE MOST attentive and witty waiter who made good suggestions and explained some menu items. We did the olives and barrata to start. Barrata is a cheese dish. Like Italian Caprese salad on steroids. I had the short ribs, AWESOME. My cohort had the scallops. Wine list is great, beer selection was great. Never waited with an empty glass (IMPORTANT!!!) Also fun was watching people check  out our food as they wandered down after their Old Town shopping spree. Would definitely go back, probably to show my out of town visitors that AZ has some class!. . PS  Try the PB&J in a jar for dessert!
Went on Monday  was fab!  Luke & Thomas took such great care of us. Food n service were awesome. Will frequent this place.  Great new vibes!  Good job guys!! . great vibe and look forward to many returns!
Excellent food, drinks and service. We go out a lot, dining on the best places and this one is definitely one of the best.
Had dinner our second night visiting Scottsdale from Los Angeles and I have to say, I was extremely impressed. We sat at the bar where both of the bartenders were extremely friendly, and truly knew the menu and what to recommend. We tried the Chopped Salad which was to die for, the scallops were amazing, the spare ribs were fabulous, and what can go wrong with popcorn with bacon added? Come on now. Definitely a place to try and a place to come back to!
I stopped in here for dinner with my parents who were visiting from Massachusetts.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever had.  My parents share that sentiment.  . . We started with some drinks (I had the very ginger/spicy Moe'scow Mule, and loved it) and shared two appetizers between the three of us: the Original Chopped Salad (smoked salmon, "trail mix", greens, freeze-dried sweet corn ... So good) and an off menu twist of the on-menu Bernie's Mac and Cheese: we had the three cheese blend, but served as a Fondue with bread, pears and a spicy meat (maybe a pastrami?) for dipping -- also amazing.  . . My father had short ribs, my mother had scallops, and I had duck (land, sea and air!) and all three were phenomenal.  The Smoked Duck Breast I had was cooked perfectly and will be the duck By which I measure all future duck meals.  . . My mother's scallops were so sweet and so tender (per our server, Chris, sushi grade) and the dried cherry barbecue sauce served with the short ribs was so uniquely sweet and spicy I left thinking of other meats it would taste good on!. . We'd originally planned on going elsewhere for desert afterwards but figured that as everything else was so good, a great desert was a likely possibility.  They did not disappoint. We finished the evening with the Choco-Chili Bread Pudding.  Not too sweet, just the right amount of spicy, and topped with a scoop of delicious tortilla ice cream. . . We left grinning ear to ear, so satisfied and recounting how tasty everything was for a good 45 minutes after the meal.  Do not pass this place by!
My friends and I came here as a big group for a birthday dinner. For some reason I thought this was more of a bar, but it is actually a foodie's delight! Our group was quite a handful (the drinks were flowing, therefore we were all very chatty... with everyone around us) but the server was SO nice and accommodating. None of us could decide on anything so we decided to get everything instead. My highlights.... . #1: Chopped salad. Doesn't sound like much but literally THE BEST SALAD EVER. It's probably not the healthiest salad in the world, but is so so so worth it.. . #2: Pan seared scallops. Perfect seared outside, nice smooth delicate inside. Delicious entree. . . Overall, great bar area for mingling/happy hour and a fantastic foodie spot as well.
Hipster cool and backs it up.  Great bar snacks - bacon popcorn ?  Of course!  Dropped in for a late Valentines Day dinner and was thrilled with the service and quality of food - great hand made cocktails too ...had filet - perfect rare with a nicely charred salty crust...wife had the Ono with a spicy tomato-based sauce.  Very well prepared!  Ill be back next time in in the Scottsdale area.  Cheers !
First and foremost they had so many nice servers. We had Gary as our server. He provided great recommendations and he interacted with our kid with such ease.  He made us feel so comfortable eating at the restaurant.  . . The food was pretty good as well.  We had the chopped salad and pork belly appetizer. The waffle and fried chicken was great if you don't mind a little heavy starter.  Cocktails were made to perfection.  . . The main course was the yummy scallop. The corn grits was between after each bite.   The Mignon filet was ok.  . . The chili bread pudding was a great closer,  but it was a bit on the dry side.  . . I can't get over the great service of this place.  I look up and there's someone to help me with everything i needed.  . . We are definitely returning to try other stuff.
Where to start? Lex is the manager and really helped me out for Valentines night. He put my preordered roses on our table and brought over our bottle of wine that I preordered. Our waiter was very cool and knowledgable. Atmosphere was great and very clean. My steak was amazing! Couldn't have been better. My wife's chicken however was not the same. Her chicken breast was very dry. We didn't say anything because we were not looking to stir things up on a great night. The dessert was amazing and you have to try it no matter how full you are. That's on point. So for the price we paid, that was the sad part. I'm going to email Lex to let him know and I'm sure they will fix the problem.
After all the great reviews I thought this would be a fun place to take some friends for a night out. Over priced, not even average food. pretentious atmosphere and pretty cruddy service. HUGE disappointment which just leaves me wondering if people think just because a place is in Scottsdale it's good. . . I honestly wanted to love it since I built the place up and was excited to try it out with my friends. . . . Good points.... the area, they have great location.
Bravo.   Valentines day success.   We called at the last minute and got the best seat in the house on valentines day at 530PM.  We called for reso at 515Pm  Talk about accomodating.   We loved the seat on the patio, It would have been the seat I would have picked.  The place was packed, but that a couple left on the patio.  Great service at the door.  It was  a prefixe menu and wow did they kill it.  Me and the wifey had filet mignon that was to die for, and my mother and father in law had Scallops and Meatloaf.  Every dish was perfectly done.   Great beers and specialty drinks, wine was cool. We have a great server that hooked us up with wines for the happy hour@!  I had a great beer, one of my favorites. Guinness on tap.....mmmmm. Dessert wasbread pudding and fudge cake with icecream...perfect for the sweet tooth in the crowd.  ME!     Bravo, thanks for being our heros for one night on Valentines, you saved the day!        We will be back,  best part, we live in Vegas and will visit you here too.  Since you have a location here.    Thanks again, great job!  5 Star Service and food, location , pretty stellar for a nighttime stroll on the streets of Scotttsdale for shopping and arts district shops.   5 STARS  All of em!
Possibly the best restaurant in Phoenix.  Thr service is amazing. Everyone is friendly. The chopped dalad changes lices. As does the beef belly BLT which is my favorite on the menu.
I almost gave this place 5 stars, but I really only give those out for "perfection."  I have to say that Citizen's Public House serves the best scallops in the city-- which is somewhat of a surprise.  They are never overcooked, and the grits they are served on are delicious as well.. . The prices are a little steep, but I will say that the quality of the food and the cocktails is very high.  Also, the serving staff is AMAZING and always very friendly.  Also, you can make a reservation through OpenTable, which is always quite handy.  I take out-of-town guests to CPH, and they have all really loved it.  Again, if the prices were a little lower and if the menu had just a few more choices, I would have given it 5 stars.
This place never ceases to amaze me.  The staff, service and food was incredible..   . Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem.  . . Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready.  We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem..   . Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!!   CPH not a problem.. . An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content. . . The food was fabulous!  I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu.  We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious!  Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent!  Everything was absolutely delicious.  . . Back to the staff & service, I have to say were all fabulous and so accommodating.  Bravo!  I can't wait to bring new friends to experience this place ......and I promise we won't be PITA's.
After all the reviews - some from folks that I respect greatly - I'm hoping this was just an anomaly... so here goes.... . Food:  Chopped salad ... fantastic - but my dining companion and I ordered it to share, and when brought to the table, the server mixed it and divided it between the four diners - each just having a spoon full or two to taste.  Not wanting to embarrass anyone - we went with it ... but they should make note of that in the order and serve accordingly.  My short ribs were under-done - meat was cooked - but - short ribs require long and slow cooking to melt away the fat and leave the yummy goodness.  My meat was so loaded with fat that I spent most of my meal trying to find lumps of meat that were edible and separate from the heavy fat layer.  Fail.  The seasonal veggie appeared to  be swiss chard or something similar - tough - long strings - not a lot of flavor - not tender.  The parsnip puree was good.  Another diner had the meat loaf that the server praised.  Large portion - but very dense and not a lot of flavor - saved by the sauce from my short ribs.  Another companion had the filet and greatly enjoyed his.. . Drinks:  Moscow mule - so so - not overwhelmed with that.  The Citizen cocktail was enjoyed.  The Tilia malbec, Mendoza, Argentina wine - "one note".  Not good, not enjoyable.  Those who had the Sazerac really enjoyed that - though it was a very small serving in a small glass.  . . Service:  Our server was great - but almost too "animated" for my liking ... but over all (other than the salad situation) - service was good - though it took a LONG time between courses and also to have plates cleared.. . Atmosphere:  Nicely decorated and in a fun area of town.  BIGGEST complaint though is the noise level.  We couldn't hear the conversation of the folks sitting on the other side of the table - this after moving once to find a more quiet table.  There's nothing in the space to help deaden the sound - hard surfaces floor to ceiling - and perhaps - the architecture of the ceiling is the culprit.  Patio would have been nice - but it was taken by a private party.  Men's room needed a splash of clorox by the urinal ... Lastly - it was a bit on the warm side.. . Not sure I'll go back ... hate to risk a good evening at these prices.  Wish I could have had the meal so many others seem to have enjoyed.
If you passed Citizen by because of the "meh" exterior, then great! More for meeeeeeeeee! The drab atmosphere is easily forgotten once you've experienced an amazing meal from start to finish. . . If you're waiting at the bar for a table, don't miss the opportunity to have the bacon popcorn with your cocktail. Yes! I said it. BACON POPCORN! With real bacon. . . Be prepared for a wait Thursday-Saturday. . . Enjoy!
Sat at the bar last night and had the best time ever! Bartender took me through all the cocktails, helping me pick my first and second choices. Ordered the chop salad (yum) then the coffee-rubbed spare ribs. Holy moly, so good. Everyone there was so friendly and wonderful - even our busboy spent 5 minutes chatting with us about what we ordered. Seriously yum and such a good night!
