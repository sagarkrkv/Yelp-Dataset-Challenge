I'm always on a hunt for a good sushi place whenever I travel. My friends and I are staying at the Venetian and came across SushiSamba on their restaurant list. It's a fusion of Japanese, Brazilian & Peruvian cuisine which got me intrigued. I usually go for the traditional Japanese sushi but with an open mind and palate, we gave it a shot.. We sat at the sushi bar, of course. The ambience was pleasant and our server, Vanessa, was very gracious giving us wonderful recommendations.. We ordered:. Sashimi Tiradito: Kanpachi (our favorite!!) and Tuna. Yamato roll - tuna, foie gras,oysters caviar & gold leaf. Lamb chop in red miso & lime. Sea bass miso & Peruvian corn. Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza. We loved the flavors of each dish and enjoyed them thoroughly. At the end, we were served 2 flavors of mochi for dessert.. It was a bit pricey but overall, great dining experience for both food and service!
This place is good, pricey but they server quality food. We have tried the grilled lamb chop, wagyu gyoza, yellowtail tiradito, sashimi 15 pieces, uni  and hotate sushi.We love each and every item, if the uni wasn't $6 a piece, I would have ordered more.
Disappointing are the first words out as I depart the resturant.  I applaud them for the boldness but the flavor profiles just do not blend. . . Hamachi sashimi - although the fish was fresh the pureed sauce and red jalapeno   kill off any flavor of the fish. . . Salt and pepper squid - good concept but over cooked. The squid was stringy. . . Shisho peppers  - not cooked well as the size of the peppers varied from very small to very large. No consistency in the bake so the small peppers were overcooked and the large peppers were still a bit undercooked. . . Sasa Handroll - a shrimp tempura with quinoa in a soy wrapper. The quinoa was aldente so the texture of the quinoa overpowered the entire roll. Also the shrimp was smothered in saracha mayo so you could not taste the shrimp. . . Sushi -.   Saba - a bit fishy.   Hamachi - nice thick cut.   Kampachi - stringy and a bit slimy.   Ikura - fresh and clean .   Uni - fresh and clean
Pretty chill spot. I gotta say the ambiance is out of this world. Ambiance alone I would recommend coming here, even if just to have a martini. . . They have a large selection of specialty cocktails, and a really awesome/unique food menu. . . I was out for a quick client lunch, and didn't have nearly as much time as i'd hoped to explore the menu. We all enjoyed our sushi and the service was pretty good too. . . This place is open for lunch which is awesome because, the other sushi spots are only open for dinner. . . This place would be great first date spot in my opinion because it's not overly romantic and would come across as fun, hip and trendy. Also would be great for birthday parties with more than a few people. . . Can't wait to bring my husband here on our next Vegas weekend.
Ok love the Palazzo, and love Sushi! It was a win win! Sat at the bar and got excellent service from the bartenders and the food was brought out efficiently.  5 stars for customer service and atmosphere.  . The tuna small plate was great and the tuna ceviche was great.  Both were packed with flavor and fresh! The presentation was beautiful, the taste was delicious every bite and I enjoyed myself.  would definitely go back!. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the prices! They are extremely high, especially for the small plates, for the amount of fish you get.  I guess thats what you get in a strip hotel but with other options there it isn't a must if you compare.  There are some gerat off the strip sushi places I can wait and go to in order to satisfy the craving!
Food was very good. . . The noise and the added noise of what they called music ruined the dinner. . . I like to have table conversation.  Not yell at them.
Nice place with great music. Great thing is they open late til 1am on a weeknight.. they have a variety of different selection.. food overall was delish.  Nice waiters kept refilling out water glasses.
Price are outrageous. Don't order the hand roll. One piece = $10 of your life. I wanted a higher end sushi restaurant and I got a rip off. The sushi was great but it still over price.. . Don't go there unless you are a high roller.
Love, love, love SushiSamba!  The service was great and the sea bass and Peruvian corn are delicious!
Delicious! If you love sushi with a twist this is the place you must visit. The dishes are beautiful works of art and their flavor mixes are bold and colorful! Do try their cocktails as well. We loved their Mojitos more than anything else. Appetizers were a little small but works out so that you could try more dishes and enjoy more flavors. Kudos to the creative chefs!
Really liked the decor and concept! I was able to try the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos (Amazing! I'd come back for these alone!) Also sampled the San Paulo roll (Great!) the  Neo Tokyo (Great) and the Eel & Cucumber (Good). Very tasty! 5 stars and Bookmarking, I'll be back!
Loved this place, from the atmosphere, to the food and service.  We went with a group of 6 and the table was very comfy, we dined in a tapas style which is one of my favorite ways to go.  Here are some of the highlighted dishes.. . Squid - this was the most tender piece of squid I have ever encountered it was seasoned perfectly with S&P and just melted in your mouth.. . Pork belly Ramon soup - Oh my so tasty, large portion of pork belly, multiple mushroom varieties, bok choy, noodles and a spicy cilantro broth.  Yummy. . Tuna Roll - with foie gras and caviar, small portion but so worth it, the fresh tuna mixed perfect with the warm foie and salty caviar.. . Sea bass Kabobs - Just get them!!!  So buttery and fresh, they had a perfect taste and texture.. . I would definitly suggest this place for groups getting ready for a big night out, they had a dj playing good music but not to loud, the lights were perfectly dimmed and the food and service was on point.  Would go back anytime.
This place was highly recommended by a friend, so we decided to stop by after watching Panda. It was a Thursday night, but the place is stillpretty packed. But they were able to fit us in even without rsvn. The server was super friendly and quickly made recommendations after finding out its our first time there. All his recommendations were amazingly delicious, especially the seabass and porkbelly. But my absolute favorite: the roll with the foie gras, caviar, gold flakes on tuna (sorry, I'm bad with remembering names). You know that feeling when you put a piece of food in your mouth and immediately get overflown by amazing flavors that make your eyes roll back with a feeling of euphoria? yea, that good!
