The girls was super duper hungry and this was one of many places that were opened late night and near our hotel.  This place reminds me of Cheesecake factory due to the decor and extensive menu. I don't remember the specifics of what we ordered, but the pizza, salad, wings were just okay. There were nothing to be wowed about.. Just happy there was food in my stomach.
This chain is consistently good and I enjoyed my meal as always.  Food was good; ceasar salad was fresh with perfectly seasoned dressing and the salmon was awesome without a hint of fishiness.  All together a great experience with quality, personable, efficient service and delicious martini's.  Safe bet for a tasty and quick meal (if need be).
Came in here for a quick dinner before getting ready to go out. Very "Cheesecake feel" obviously.  The food was good. I loved their Asian Nachos. I ended up getting a pasta dish (forgot the name) and it was decent. A little too heavy for my taste, but that differs from person to person so i don't count it against them. My husband ordered a meaty pasta dish that  DID NOT look so appetizing (looks like someone diarrhea'd all over a plate of noodles) but if you could get past the looks of it, it was actually pretty good. They should definitely serve it premixed. . . I had ordered a Caesar salad to go with my food, but the waitress forgot to write it down and accused me of not ordering it...although everyone else at my table heard it. It was a lot of food, so I didnt mind so much...except the accusation.. . Overall it was a good place to eat for nothing special. It's really like a "lets go out to eat cause I dont want to cook" kinda place and not a place to eat when you want something nicer.
Of course we had to come to the cheesecake factory's big sister! We came a little too late to have breakfast so we all had sandwiches. The service was definitely slow and it was a bit frustrating. Also, we were sat uncomfortably close to a servers station and had to feel like we were in the way. . Now the positives!! Their mimosas were great!!!! I was pleasantly surprised! Their menu was easily marked with "gf" for those of us who have to live gluten free. The gf menu is fairly large so you won't just have to settle for a salad! Everyone enjoyed their food and their huge serving sizes!
I give the food 4 stars, and the service 1 star.. I've been here twice months apart, most recently yesterday. The first time I ate here was this past summer, on a not so busy Sunday late afternoon. We were seated quickly but took 1.5 hours for our food to come! When asked what the delay was, management actually came out, apologized and said my friend's sandwich had to be remade because it was dropped on the ground. Fine. . As for yesterday, we also came for brunch and were a group of 6, we were seated right away because it wasn't so busy. Great because we were starving. Our waitress took 30 minutes to come and introduce herself, and disappeared for a long while-- we had to ask other staff if we could please put in our order (we were starving). She finally took our order, but later on came out to tell us she would be leaving and we would have another server. After 1 hour of waiting for our food to come (and not seeing our new waitress since the switch) we noticed that we were never even given the complimentary bread that all the other tables received. We asked another server (not ours, she was still missing) if we could have bread and by that time our server was coming out with our orders, which were ALL COLD.. The food is great at this place-- I've had the fried chicken strips and waffles, and the corned beef hash-- I hate to give it a poor review, since the chefs and cooks seem to have it on point! But man is the service bad.
It's like a better and barely more expensive Cheesecake factory.. . Fantastic Cheesecake like menu, better service, right in the heart of Venetian and open late.. . Came here twice, once with one a friend and once with S.O. on a double date. We have always enjoyed it. The portions are large, but are reasonably fresh and service is really nice.
I always come here every time I come to Vegas and they never fail me with the food they have.  Open 24 hours a day which is good and have a variety of food from pastas, chicken, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and so much more.  the service is fast and friendly.
I pop in every now and then for a grilled cheese sandwich and soup.  The service is always great.
I had the experience of eating at the LA location years ago, and I remembered it to be quite fancy. Nowadays when my gf's and I do vegas, this is the place they die for after a night of partying. They go bananas for the potatoes egg rolls, I mean BANANAS, IE. 2-4 dozens! its pretty good but I think I like to change things up sometimes :|
THEY LIE !!  We can't trust their ingredients. I asked for olive oil.  They told me I was getting extra-virgin olive oil. I read the can it came out of.  A tiny fraction of it was Olive oil. I Then confronted the manager. He put his head down in shame, and said "it's not really olive oil"
We stopped in for a late night/early morning bite after pounding the liquor hard at the Bourbon Room. We were kind of disappointed that most of the menu wasn't available that time of night. We were really craving an entree, but had to settle on sandwiches instead. We ordered some ahi tuna to start.. . The tuna was ok, nothing spectacular or anything. It was served with carrots, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. There was no soy sauce or wasabi served with the dish. Instead, the platehad a line of what appeared to be some kind of creamy horseradish.. . I ordered a BLT and it was tasty. Nothing really to write home about, but then again it's a BLT, kind of hard to screw up.. . Our server was very friendly and attentive considering the time of day. I would probably pass if I had to eat here again, but if you want a bite to eat during odd hours, it's one of the few places open where you can sit down and have a bite.
What do you do when you are damn hungry and want to eat really tasty food somewhere on The Strip at 02:00 hrs? Well, you go to Grand Lux Cafe :). . I was staying in Venetian with my wife and was looking for some food joint near by. Grand Lux Cafe came to our mind since we liked the complimentary breakfast here. We ordered  Veggie Burger, Margarita Pizza and Garden Omelette. Here is what we liked about this cafe:. 1. Food was just awesome. It was so tasty that we ended up eating a lot more. . 2. Serving size was much more than we expected(at least if I compare that to Gordon Ramsay Burgr). . 3. Ambience is really really good. . 4. It is not costly at all. . 5. Wide variety of options to choose from. Me and my wife are eggetarian and even we could find sufficient number of options to choose from. . 6. It is open 24 hrs. . Something not to miss in Vegas !
I love grand luxe because of the food the prices and the usually amazing service. My recent experience was not so great but they still get a solid 3 stars from other experiences here. . . Buffalo Wraps are the best appetizer ever!. Never get the pulled pork grilled cheese, the pork was nasty with an after taste. . . The Kobe burger was great!. . Service was speedy and attentive but our waitress was a little snippy with us at times. . . Overall a great place to eat in Vegas!
This place is SO great! A sister restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory but so much better. The menu is huge and a tad overwhelming. Even though the line tends to be long they seat you in under 10 minutes. The red velvet pancakes are to die for! . . A must in Vegas
Unresponsive manager and people using their fingers to get food from the buffet! Yuck. Save the $19/pp and go somewhere else. . . Ate here on a Saturday morning and ordered the breakfast buffet. Hot plates to put cold fruit on, if you can find a plate at all. Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.. . My husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.. . When we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening. Did not offer any remedy. All he could tell me was that he would look into quality control. Our server was the one who suggested we order breakfast from the menu. . . Walk right on by this restaurant.
Had breakfast on a Saturday morning. Wait was about 5 mins to get seated. . . Food selection was great with a lot of variety. Didn't choose the buffet because it kinda looked the buffet at a "normal" hotel. Opted for the Chicken and Waffles instead. Outstanding decision if I must say. . . Overall everyone in our party enjoyed their breakfast. Would definitely eat here again
Open 24/7! . My friend and I split a regular Asian salad. Our server was nice enough to have the chef split the salad into two plates. The portions were still huge!!
Really liked this place.  As many others have said, it feels like an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  This means you're going to have tons of variety, a massive menu, and some good free bread.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table (a massive rush came in after us).  The space is huge.  There are so many tables in the back area, so the fact that it was full at 4:30-5 p.m. is a good sign.  We had some edamame to start, which was nicely seasoned and came with a great dipping sauce.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes and coleslaw with peanuts.  The whole thing was delicious.  I think I ended up with about 5 pieces of fried chicken, which was a lot, so I was unable to finish it.. . A little tip for those going, if you are wanting to conduct business or use your smartphone in the back area where most of the tables are, you're going to have a hard time getting a signal.  This could be good for conversation with family, but potentially difficult if you're trying to conduct business.. . I would highly recommend this place.  I was a little nervous going to a sit down place at the Venetian because you never know what the pricing will be, but the Grand Lux Cafe was very reasonable.  My wife and I got drinks, an appetizer, and two full-sized entrees and spent around $40 before tip.  Check it out!
Great salads. Try the Manhatten or for lunch the Pasta Fresca. Large portions - enough to split with your other easily. Freshest quality. Good service. Very reasonable prices for a Vegas casino location, $10-$15 for most huge entrees. We will go again!
