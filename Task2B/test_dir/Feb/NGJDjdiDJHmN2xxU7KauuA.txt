It's true you get what you pay for but wow this was terrible. I would give this a negative review if I could. The only good thing about this hotel was the location. The only service worth mentioning were the bellmen and some of the valet staff. The hotel charges for EVERYTHING additional. If you want to call valet from your room to get your car you have to upgrade and pay to a member status. You have to pay extra for a refrigerator in your room and doesn't come with a coffee maker. 2 of the 3 rooms we got didn't even have ice buckets. Cleaning service didn't give new towels after 4 days and left dirty cups in the rooms. 2 of the 3 showers would get clogged every morning and the plumbing made noises everyday from the other rooms in the hotel. You would think with all the competition on the strip they would want to do their best to secure repeat business. This is the WORST hotel that 8 people agreed we had ever stayed in. I could go on and on with everything that was wrong but I don't want to waste my time on this hotel anymore. We will never go back to that "dirty bird" again.
We picked the Flamingo because it was affordable and convenient (located right on the Strip). Bad call! Customer service was a disaster and the place was not very well maintained.. . Our experiencewith early check-in epitomizes our customer service experience at the Flamingo. The website says that they cannot promise early check-in, but when we arrived at 8am from the airport, we were told that the room we booked was vacant and just needed to be cleaned, so we should come back in half an hour to an hour. We come back about an hour later, and are told that we need to come back in another half an hour to an hour. Finally, we go back another hour later and are told the same thing. It takes until past noon for us to check in. I wouldn't have minded if they had just told us up-front that we wouldn't be able to check in until later, because then we would have checked our bags and gone to explore Vegas, but by continually pushing us off for short periods, we were not able to leave the hotel and just had to wait for them to figure their shit out for hours.. . Customer service disasters (sadly, there were others) aside, I will say that the Flamingo is very convenient. Right across the street from Caesar's Palace, etc. We also liked how many cabs, party buses, etc, were easy to access from the hotel. Other amenities? Huge casino, multiple Mexican restaurants, a sushi restaurant, a food court, a convenience store.. . The upshot: The Flamingo is probably good if you really like to gamble and you want a good deal on rooms, but I'll definitely be looking elsewhere for our next Vegas weekend.
My friend arrived the night before so I cant talk about check in.. The room was very big and we had a little refrig in it. It was very clean and the beds comfy.. my friend complained a bit about the pillows , to me they were ok.  The bathroom was clean and had a tv on the mirror. The shower stayed hot and it had 2 jets so great pressure.
The room is nice, but the walls are thin and can hear everything in the rooms next to me. Plus it does not help that there is a women walking the hallway screaming this hotel sucks. Though I suppose that is not the resorts fault. . Also it could do for some updates to the hotel itself in the lobby, and it is not easy to access. Had to walk through a mall type area to get to check in. Hopefully the weekend will pan out. Not sure I would recommend it to others coming to Vegas.
I have stayed at the Flamingo twice in the past couple months. Both times have been fairly good, one a little better than the other. When I stayed in December, we upgraded to a view Deluxe room and it was pretty nice. The bathroom was redone with a glass shower...nice lighting...tv in the mirror...great view (slightly obstructed by their peeling 'skin' of Donny and Marie). I went and stayed again last weekend and we were in the area that hadn't been renovated so recently. The bathroom was kind of disgusting.... the tub was tiny and had an AC vent in it that was full of grime...yuck. The room itself was clean and had a hard floor (which I liked) and the beds were comfy. View was not so good, but it was a less expensive room. The prices weren't bad (40-50$ per night), but the resort fee of 18$ per night was a little ridiculous considering you don't really get anything for it...especially in the winter. I would stay here again, the location can't be beat and the rooms are fine for the price.
Opt for the upgraded room. Its much better than the standard rooms.
The Flamingo has evolved into a decent mid-sized option for Vegas.  It won't have all of the bells and whistles of the megaresorts, but it has a lot more to offer than the budget hotels.  Call it a nice medium.. . I've been to Vegas maybe 30 times and I've grown into a more relaxing pace, which the Flamingo is good for.  It's big enough to offer a lot of services but not too big where you're walking 5 minutes to get from place to place.  The casino, elevators, and restaurants are all close by.  The staff are friendly and the people are relaxed.. . It's probably not the best option if you're looking for amazing nightlife or a wild weekend, but it's centrally located so all of those things are close by if that's why you want.  Great access to the beautiful Paris and Bellagio, and City Center is a couple of walkways away.. . The rooms are the same, much better than the budget hotels but obviously a bit older.  The renovations are nice and the size is good, and so is the bed.  The bathroom is small if that's important to you.. . I went mid-week during the slow season so the price was $26.  Definitely worth the price considering you'll be paying the same for Excalibur or the Stratosphere.  It's a big step up from those places if those are your options.
Yeah this is not great.. Furniture from several decades in here.. Weird plasticky rubbery woodish-looking floors.. Scratchy fur blankets at ends of beds have seen some action.. Walls marred and filthy, furniture and cabinetry dinged and scratched. . No coffee maker. Really?? A room at a Motel 6 has one. And they wouldn't hand one over. Said my room wasn't equipped for it?. Where is the shampoo?. The wifi totally crawls.... Where's the fridge I requested (medical) that all of a sudden they're charging me for? I've never been charged for a fridge, or a coffee maker.. Oh I am not the first to use this roll of toilet paper... . Some buttons on the phone don't work.. Neither does the vending machine.. Each person I talk to to try to address something sends me to someone else, and some of the folks are rude.. I travel a *lot*. At least once monthly. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this one jst really blows, and not in a silly/sleazy/charming way, either (like Excalibur). Am only staying here b/c the meeting I'm attending booked into this place and it will be the *last time* for sure.
Outdated. Rooms are not too bad but tv channel lineup is nowhere to be found. And there is like 4 channels that come in. Paper thin walls as well. Stay somewhere else.
It wasn't a bad place to stay, it was comfortable. But I won't stay here again. We stayed in a two queen bed room and one of the beds was broken (falling off the box spring) so we called down to let them know, so we would not be responsible for it. They said someone would be up to fix it. When we came back hours later, the bed looked like it had been moved but not fixed. So the next day we went down stairs to the desk to ask about it, and she said she would put in an order to have it looked at while we were gone for the day. We came back again hours later, and it was STILL broken! The bed was leaning so bad I took pictures to show management, but they don't have a "contact us" on there website. Horrible! Just imagine if someone got hurt... That's a huge law suite waiting to happen!
There was no parking also they refused to valet, was available for diamond members only. Too long line to check in. Not enough staff. Hope the room is worth it.
VEGAS IS NOT FOR KIDS. . There I said it. With all the things that kids have in the world (Disneyland, playing consoles, smart phones, etc.) adults need to have their own playpen. People say I'm an old soul. I like the Vegas of old - a swinging town dominated by gamblers. Even though they're more visitors in Vegas, Macau has become what Vegas was -  the gambling capital of the world. People say the Flamingo is run down. To that I would respond is that if it wasn't for the Flamingo the Las Vegas Strip that we know today wouldn't have existed. The Flamingo isn't kid friendly but if you want that then go to Circus Circus. Let's be honest casinos like Circus Circus wouldn't have made The Strip what it is today. The Flamingo represents a lot of history through good times (Rat Pack) and bad times (mob). There's a certain character the Flamingo that exhibits through this day. Of all the hotels featured in the 1960 movie "Ocean's 11" Flamingo is one of the two hotels remaining.. . During the Presidents' Day Weekend my friend and me stayed here for 3 days. I never stayed the Flamingo before. My original review of the Flamingo was a 5-star rating because I won over $700 about 2 years ago that paid off my Vegas trip. When we arrived this past Thursday there was a long line in the check in line. However there was no line at the Total Rewards Gold Member line. Being a Total Rewards Gold Member I went to that line to quickly check in. (Here's a tip be a Total Rewards Member so you don't have to wait for a long line at the regular check in.) . . We stayed at the Go Room. This room represents a modern feel that includs a 42" HD TV and a TV in the bathroom. One of the features I love about the Flamingo is the layout of the casino itself. Even though the casino is smaller than most casinos all the gaming activities are centralized and not spread out as some casinos in The Strip. This makes people gamble more. Another great feature is the garden that includes a wedding chapel and swimming pools. Unfortunately the swimming pools were closed due to renovations. . . You might ask if I love the Flamingo so much then why on my updated review I didn't give a 5-star rating this time? Two years ago I stayed at the Roman Tower at Caesars Palace. That room at Caesars was twice as spacious than at the Go Room of the Flamingo even though I paid a little more at Caesars. That was the only knock on the Flamingo. . . The Flamingo remains a gambling playpen for those adults who want to relive the Old Vegas the without the hassle of a kid friendly atmosphere.
I am an Interior Designer and was excited to attend KBIS the big kitchen and bath show. So big special pricing offered for Flamingo. But on way from airport in cab I asked the driver about the Flamingo... He hesitated and told a story about two gals who stayed there and had him in stitches about a nasty sofa in the room that they actually had staff take away. Hmmmm. So this made me nervous. Upon checkin with all the cigarette smoke and noise I said I was concerned. They offered me an upgrade at plus $50 a night and I took it. . But basically my room had a super nasty sofa that was super dirty. Very retro in a bad way. Clean sheets but bed was lopsided. Stayed but was reluctant to touch anything. . Not reccomemded
The box office is a joke. You shouldn't have to wait an hour to pick up tickets. When there is a line of 100 people and only 2 workers, that is ridiculous. The Flamingo needs to do better than that for me to continue doing business with them. You bet I will tell everyone I know about my experience.
We are just checking in now but, so far so GREAT!! Marissa P.  at the front desk has been ABSOLUTELY great!! She arranged us the perfect room after looking up several options for us!! Our trip has only just begun but, so far a great first impression from Marissa!
Best parts of the Flamingo:. -middle of the strip--great location. -clean rooms. -decent price. -the flamingo habitat (wonder if it's humane, but...). . Bad part of the Flamingo:. -awful smell in the lobby/casino that smells like air freshener mixed with cigarettes and vomit. -the elevators don't work very well. -they messed up our bill when we checked in which started things off in a really frustrating way. -unprofessional desk staff
Decent middle of the road hotel on The Strip. Good location, but needs some fine tuning in the rooms. Huge stains on the carpet skeeve me out. Also, I do not understand the need for the sliding frost glass door on the bathroom that has no lock. If I want to feel like I am taking a dump in front of people I will go outside. Good customer service though.
This was the first and last time I stayed at the Flamingo.  First of all, they do not properly keep track of your play at the tables.  They had less than half of what I played at the tables, which resulted in nothing for comps.  I am talking about $2500 and getting credit for $1200, which was a total loss.  . The rooms are not clean and kept up.  The elevators take a long waiting time and some don't work at all.  Getting service on the floor takes too long.  This is the worst casino I have ever been at and you will not get comped like any other Caesars casino.  You can go to any other Caesar casino and get comped for play, get a better room, buffet, and shows, but not at the Flamingo.  . . This was the worst stay in Las Vegas.  If this was my first stay in Las Vegas I would wonder how the other casinos treat their clients.  But, coming to Las Vegas at least 5 times a year I know what you should get at the casinos for play.
