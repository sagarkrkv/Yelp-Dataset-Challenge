Average food, great service!
One of my friends who still lives in Las Vegas, owed me dinner so when I made my way to the high desert for the holidays, he made reservations at CUT so he could pay off his debt. . . Having lived in Las Vegas, I normally stay away from the Las Vegas Strip unless I'm showing someone around, but when it comes to dinner with a friend, and it's steak - you know I'm there! . . I'll start with the service. Everyone should dine here to experience what customer service in the food service industry should be like. I don't know what more to say other than the only way it could be better is if I could just lie on a couch while they hand fed me. . . I've said it before and I'll say it again - food almost always tastes so much betterwhen the service is good. I opted for the Rib Eye and it was so tasty that I inhaled it like it was the first time I ever had beef. It's always nice when you order a piece of meat cooked a certain way and it comes out exactly as you want. To me, the sides were okay and I later was told I should have tried the marrow. . . I'll brave the Strip traffic and all the crowds to come here again. To me, the service alone was worth it.
Hold the seasoning! Holy burnt toast. That's exactly what our steaks came out as. We were told they had house seasoning but way to salty for our tastes. I ended up slicing the blackened crust of seasoning on top because I couldn't handle it. Otherwise good steak albeit overpriced. We're talking about more pricey than NYC prices.  Wagyu is solid. Don't be scared of the small portion for the price. Small piece of well marbled wagyu is so rich you'll be full after a few bites. But seriously, ease up on seasoning!
After going to different steakhouses. Holy crap I love this place. I've been to the Vegas one twice and the Beverly Hills one three times as well. Amazing. But the Vegas one is better in my opinion.
Super late review (2 years late...) but this place is AMAZE-BALLS!!. . Booked via opentable and mentioned that we were celebrating the bf's bday. We were treated like royalty!! We were seated at a HUGE table near the kitchen (not that great with all the foot traffic) but the service was excellent! Our waiter was prompt and very amicable. The food was delicious and perfectly cooked!  The atmosphere was pretty romantic with dimmed lights, but generally the crowd was pretty casual and there were several large (6+ people) groups. The BEST part was the dessert! Since I mentioned it was the bf's bday, CUT comped us a dessert, a baked alaska and wrote "Happy Birthday" in chocolate on the plate. Baked alaska is officially my new favorite dessert!! I'm still dreaming about eating it!!. . I def recommend going to CUT for a special occasion since it is a bit pricey. The service alone deserves the 5 stars.
Took me forever to write a review because it wasn't memorable..I went with my brothers and all I could say is that their steak cart display before you order was the sell..now the actual food one it cooked was just mediocre..ill never come back because if I'm paying $96 for a steak it better be top notch
This restaurant just blows my mind away. From the staff to the food, everything was just amazing. Thank you for making my boyfriends bday, an evening to remember. We can't wait to come back to Vegas for another taste. Cheers!!
We've heard a lot about this place & decided to try it for our Anniversary.. Food was good, but it was definitely over priced!!! I would sayit's more the hype. If you want an amazing steak, try Del Friscos. You will not be disappointed... It's very classy, great service & their prices are good for what you get. DO NOT forget to order the lemon cake!
Best steakhouse ever. Split the porterhouse for two and I swear the steak melted in my mouth. Better than Mastros, way better than STK. Top drawer service and overall experience. Just awesome.
Continuing the tradition of doing one fine dining per trip to Vegas me and my buddy decided to try CUT by Wolfgang Puck.  We decided to try this restaurant due to the fact that they served True Japanese 100% Japan Wagyu which is really hard to find.  Most place serve either American kobe, American wagyu or Australian wagyu.  Rarely do they serve authentic wagu. . . Reservation: Reservation was not bad at all.  You could easily make reservations the day of.  However, i would suggest making it several hours in advance just to be on the safe side.  The more last moment u make the reservation the later the time it seemed like. (I had gotten a reservation at 8pm but when i called around 7 to add 2 more people it got pushed to 10pm). . Location:  Cut was located inside the Palazzo hotel on the Lobby floor.. . Decor:  The decor was very nice.  It had somewhat of a modern theme.  Like with most fine dining restaurants, it had a slightly romantic dim light setting.  However it was not quiet nor too loud which was really nice since you can actually have a conversation with  your date or friends and not feel like your talking to loud or have a hard time hearing them.. . Food: . . Bone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad - This dish was delicious  and cooked perfectly.  It was evenly cooked and the mushroom marmalade complimented the bone marrow very nicely.. . True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Miyazaki Prefecture, Kagoshima-  What can i say about this dish except that it was truly melt in your mouth delicious.  This was probably one of the best steaks i have had.  Typically for steaks, i have meat cooked at a medium rare but this time i asked the waiter how i should have this cut cooked since it was my first time eating 100% wagyu.  His recommendation was medium.  His reason was that it would allow all the heavy marbling to melt and absorb into the meat.  Cooking it medium rare may not melt the marbling completely and may leave it chewy.  As a result i went with Medium and i am glad i did.  The wagyu came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  I love the fact that they charred the top and bottom slightly so you get an initial flavorful crunch and then as u sink your teeth further into the meat it slowly melts away.  8oz was just perfect enough to get you full due to how rich it is.. . I will def be coming back again for some more bone marrow and wagyu.
This was a great dinning experience with my best friend.  I had the the US Kobe Ribeye medium which was cooked prefect for me. He had the US Kobe filet medium rare also cooked just right. Sides where baby spinach sauted with garlic and sea salt and black pepper still had a bite which was great. Fingerlings where also sauted in garlic little rosemary sea salt and black pepper. The som Christine had suggested a great bottle of wine that paired very well with the dinner. Our server Erin was very helpful also knew her menu as well. The food runners described every dish well. Great place for everyone.
Third time here and still outstanding! Good is delicious, prepared well and of great quality. Service is top notch. Wine and cocktail menu is excellent. We plan to go back every year.
PDSF Review:  PARKING is free (hotel parking).  DECOR is chic modern.  SERVICE was absolutely excellent; I sat at the bar; server checked up on me almost every 10 minutes.  FOOD was delicious, but relative to the price, I would have to downgrade.  I got the $60 New York Steak... which was delicious, but I think $40 at Ruth Chris may result in the same culinary satisfaction.  There is definitely an upcharge for the name and the prestige of eating at Cut.  However, the 3 steak sauces and salt were a great optional add-on.  Will not go back.
If I could give this place a zero, I would. I haven't gotten into the swing of yelping often but this is one of those experiences that is so terrible that you just have to write about it. And actually, I went months ago, but looks like I never finished my review.. . Came here with a group of 14 girls for a bachelorette party. We had spent weeks picking out the perfect place for dinner and were really looking forward to our meal. They go through the motions of being a five star restaurant but you can tell they definitely don't think you're a five star customer. You might think we're a prissy/snooty bunch but I assure you, we could have eaten hot dogs and been happy but we chose a nice place so we could have a memorable experience.. . Started with the bone marrow appetizer. It was tasty as marrow usually is, you can probably share it since it came with two pieces and it's so rich. I had the Australian Wagyu. Good quality meat though I've had rib eye prepared much better. It's just a slab of meat on your plate, not to mention overcooked. Presentation points: 0. *shrugs maybe I wanted to be impressed since it is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, oh well. . . They suggested that we get sides to share for each half of the table. There was a misunderstanding when a waiter began to serve out sides on our individual plates that was actually for the other side. Even after asking him to stop, he ignored our request and kept serving away. One of the head waitresses came over to ask what was wrong. She told us that all sides were supposed to be family style and left it at that. Family style is fine but if that's the case, don't put it on everyone's plate if they don't want to eat it, especially after we asked you not to. Her tone was so extremely rude that many of us were taken aback.. . Maybe it's because we were a large group but I can honestly say that I have never been treated so poorly at any dining establishment. We even talked to a manager and I can't even bring myself to tell you their response. SO disappointing. The only reason CUT is 'memorable' is because I can't forget how unhappy we were when we finally left. Poor attitudes, poor communication, poor service all around. . . Never again. And anytime a friend mentions Vegas, I tell them to stay away from CUT. Really not worth the price you pay.
Just went last night and its the best steak house I have been. Service was great, always very attentive and there to clean up afteryou, giving you many assortments of breads, and 5 different assortments of sauces for the steak. We got the porterhouse , brussel sprouts and the polenta. All of it was excellent!!! We didn't order dessert but still got these small bites of a lemon and a chocolate pie which were good. Love this place.
