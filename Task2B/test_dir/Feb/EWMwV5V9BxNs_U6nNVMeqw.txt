Great food. Great drinks. Love the atmosphere. Servers are super friendly.
Oh FEZ I love you. I ordered the harissa fries and a black bean burger with avocado. Both were outstanding! The service is great and there are many tantalizing choices that you just can't get anywhere else.
Great food!
Awesome place for almost everything!!! Great service! Excellent food and drinks! We ordered tomato taza salad......fantastic! And a burger...juicy and tender! Love it!
As a surprise, my husband took me to the Surprise Fine Arts and Wine Festival last weekend.. It is an annual event; next year it will be their third and we would both highly recommend attending it.. . Having never been to Surprise, AZ before, we had no idea where to dine, so I checked-in with Yelp. . . We realized we were close to Babbo and decided to give it a try.. Yummy! . Great crusty bread, helpful waiter, good service and reasonable prices. As I was leaving, I grabbed one of the take-with menus and realized that they have six locations in the Valley.. . We'll definitely be looking for them.
The food was good, the atmoshere was great. If the waiter would have been more interested I would have at least gave a 4 star.
My favorite thing to have at Fez is weekend brunch. The Big Boy Mimosa is amazing and any other mimosa will seem tame and less tasty after you've tried Fez's version.  Their bloody mary is also great.  Food wise, I love the kiseras but am not a big fan of their burgers.  Oh and the rosemary and garlic fries are the perfect thing to share with a group.
Amazing, everything was great.  The service was great, food was soooo good, ambiance was fun.  Will be back!!
I've been reluctant to write this review because the food is so stinkin good!!! I absolutely love the green pasta (I think its $13.95) and the portions are amazing. The burgers are perfect every time and I love thefries options... But the service... oh the service, IS SO UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL. I've gotten the same guy the last couple times I went in and he is just terrible. Tyler? Taylor? something like that. But he was more worried about his hair and scarf than he was about anything going on around him. The day I went with my parents, I had to ask 3 times for him to refill my mom's ice tea. Eventually, I grabbed another server for it. I took my boyfriend and a couple of his friends in for a birthday and he had to came back two or three times because he couldn't remember what we ordered, and that was just DRINKS! On top of it, his tone and smile are so sarcastic and fake, its insulting. Its unreal how many of us will never be back because of him.
Best fries I have had in awhile. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the cocktails were good as well. Loved the lively atmosphere and will be back soon- for sure.
Went here tonight with my wife and son. Let me preface that it does not have a kid friendly menu but he was a good sport about trying the food. I had the salmon dish with couscous and steamed veggies. It's a good selection if you've had a rough day and need a light refreshing meal to turn what's left of your day.my wife had the lamb curry. Great curry flavor along with a small kick for flavor and spice. My son ordered a strawberry blueberry salad. He liked the salad but the idea of adding fruit to it was a bit odd for him. He's an apple kind of guy anyway. But he did enjoy the salad despite it having a balsamic dressing. Never heard of an 8 year old who likes balsamic. Guess there's a first time for everything. We ordered the chicken phyllo app. Our server forgot to put them in the system and brought them to use after we had completed our entrees. They were pretty good however and it came with this orange sauce. Not to much in flavor but I might order it again. As an apology for not ordering our apps he brought out a chocolate hazelnut cheesecake on the house. I was concerned about the potential for heavy handedness with the hazelnut but it was just a touch on the palette that provided a nice aftertaste. Recommend eating this with the strawberry they provide to cut through the heavyness of the cheesecake because after all....it's cheesecake. Overall I enjoyed our experience and I would be happy to return in the future. Next time I'll try the hamburger as it comes with ciabatta.
Been meaning to try this place forever and day and finally had a chance to for an early dinner yesterday.  I would say there weren't a terrible amount of opitons for us, being mostly vegetarian with a 2 y/o toe-head in tow, FEZ was more of a sandwich/salad place with a little middle eastern flair thrown in, for people with no kids.. . That being said, the salt n pepa fries were good and out little one enjoyed the pita bread, but obvs not much of a healthy dinner and we had to refeed the tot when we arrived back home.  . . For me, the veggie burger was pretty darn good.  Nice soft bun and a unique twist with roasted tomatoes and goat cheese.  The side salad dressing was excellent, I want to say mint and honey?  . . Looked like they had a pretty good happy hour in the bar and I might have to come back with a friend for nosh and drinks.
So all in all the food here is good, I wouldn't say great. I had the fez chicken sandwich, which again was good but I'm not sure I would say was life changing. The chicken was great, tasted grilled and nice, but there was too much dressing a it was dripping in my hand. The salad was great-I'm always happy when I'm asked for the healthy option with fries as an up charge. . . The service was good but inconsistent. I received good tips but with poor follow up. I asked to taste some beers and received them right away, but after my food was delivered I didn't see my server till I was half way done.. . So all in all it was good but I've had better furring my time in AZ
Great food but very expensive.  Worth a try at least once.  Went here for lunch and had a salad.. Get the large cause their small salad is too small ;). . I had a strawberry like salad and it was very good!  This place ain't cheap but all the dishes coming out the kitchen looked yummy!  Not a bad lunch spot.
Love the hummus and apricot margaritas! I don't think I've ever had anything here that I didn't enjoy.
The first time I had dinner at FEZ it was a wonderful meal. My friend and I sat on the patio, enjoyed one of their cocktails and then had some delicious food. That time they deserved 4 stars. My second visit wasn't as enjoyable. I stopped by to get a burger during lunch and decided to get it to-go. The burger was cold, they had just thrown some shredded cheese on it and not even bothered to melt it, the patty was not what I am used to getting when I pay 9 dollars for a burger, in fact, imagine a hash brown from mcdonalds that was made with ground beef instead of potatoes but that had the same cardboard like taste. This was probably one of those items I wouldn't order again. The service the first time was great, the second time since I ordered to go so I can't comment on it.
Nice little spot. Cool ambiance and good customer service. Some healthy but delicious dishes on the menu as well. I will be back! . . Pros: . - Good food with healthy selection. - Chill ambiance. - Price. . Cons. - Color way. - Menu design
