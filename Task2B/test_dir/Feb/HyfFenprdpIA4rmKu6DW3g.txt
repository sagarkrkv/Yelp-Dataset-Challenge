My boyfriend raved about this spot for the longest. I finally got the chance to try it for myself. Omg the first spoon full of my house gumbo was AWESOME!! We were so greedy we ordered double crab, shrimp, chicken and lobster! The gumbo was seasoned to perfection. I ordered mine at a #7 which was a little too spicy for me. I haven't stop talking about this spot since I left Vegas. This will be my "go to" spot every time I go to Vegas!!
OMFG this place is AMAZING.. . We had to wait in a line for like 60 minutes, but totally was worth the wait.. . We had two items: Palace Pan Roast with lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Chicken, and Andouille Sausage - spicy level 5. Alaskan Chowder, New England Style with Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. And Oysters with Horseradish and Cocktail Sauce. So delicious!. . The local vibe here is also great. The guy next to me was Vegas native and spent his entire life of 40 years here, enjoyed the convo over the great food. Fabulous experience indeed!
This place is open 24 hours and there is always a wait, that's how good it is. I have Rtitter's back home with the steam kettle cooking method too but it's just not as good as Oyster Bar. Part of the wait is due to the fact that there isn't many seats and they're understaffed. I feel for these employees they work their butts off. Although they're probably tired the service is not affected. I think they should have atleast one more person working the shift and possibly expanding. The first time I went it was a 2 hour wait just to be  seated and there was about 14 people ahead of me. The second time there was 5 people ahead of me and luckily I got seated after 20 minute wait but the food didn't come until an hour later. I go pretty late at night too. I recommend the pan roast spicy level 9 if you can handle the heat, by the way I'm normally a 7 spice level at other places. This still tastes good the next day when the rice breaks up it adds texture. It goes well with pasta too. The shrimp and lobster fradiablo is delicious too. The difference with the pan roast is that it has brandy and cream. If you're ok with eating raw seafood give the clams on the half shell a try. It's chewy and doesn't have the smelly salt water taste. The New England clam chowder was meh. The portions are big but there is a $5 split charge, kinda steep in my opinion. Screw it just order to and eat the leftovers tomorrow. If you're lucky and have  a microwave in your hotel room. Or get creative and heat it up with a blow dryer. You can also chill it in an ice bucket or sink and bring it back home. They have moonlight specials 1am-9am 16oz bud light draft for $2, bloody mary for $3.50, half a dozen oysters on the half shell for $9, you save $3.
What can I say, this place still rocks! Had lunch here on Monday and what was supposed to be a "snack" ended up being a full blown meal! Started off with oysters and clams on the half shell, and ordered a combo pan roast with a spicy level of 10. Yes 10, the heat is so unbelievably good! Some of the patrons seated next to me were dying with a heat level of 6, so people were looking at me like I was nuts.. . Ricardo and Dolores are awesome! Great sense of humor and both on top of their game!
I started going to Oyster Bar a few years ago. Every time I eat there I always rave about how OMG amazing it is to friends and family, and I'm sure whoever has also eaten there does the same... so naturally the place has become exponentially as popular as it was a few years ago! But its definitely worth the wait! and now its 24 hrs.  :). . I always get #1. AlaskanChowder. The Alaskan Chowder is the New England clam chowder base and has lobster, crab, shrimp, and clams in shell. Its basically clam chowder on steroids!... and they probably sprinkle some crack in there too. It's so addicting and to die for!. . and #2. Pan Roast (Combo). The Combo Pan Roast only has seafood, no chicken or sausage. I think if you get the meats, it changes the flavor of the stew. The consistency is so creamy and rich, and full of flavor. You can select your spicy level 1-10. I don't dare to go past level 4. I think most people get spicy 5, and its pretty spicy already.. . I always want to order an extra "to-go" meal, because I just can't get enough of it when I'm in town... but they don't let you. :(   Until next time Oyster Bar... I'll see you in my dreams!
Very good Cherry Stone claim and OMG. Pan Roast with Crab was unbelievable.. Oyster was not fresh but Cherry Stone claim was VERY VERY Good ! We had to wait in line for 1 hr. 30 min. not because of many people waiting. There were only 14 seats and systems is just really bad for people waiting in a line. Worst thing is there were no internet connection and  you just have to wait for ever~~~. But food is absolutely good.
Delish!! wait is long but worth, Everything is so good.  I love it
Over all good place to eat.. Luckily we didn't have to wait in line but we still waited 40 minutes for our food so I couldn't give 5 stars. . Oysters were very good but too big. So made me full. . . I ordered crab pan roast was very good. Great portions lots of meat. . . Jambalaya was good lots of meat and great portion. . . I would come again but not if there is a long line.
Is it a bar with oysters? Say whaaaa?!? *confuzzled*. . I didn't understand the concept at first, but my boyfriend swore to me that the Southern Cajun dishes at this establishment are superior in quality and taste. I was sold because one of my favorite cuisines is Southern. Think bold, spicy flavors :P I'm also always open in trying new restaurants that specialize in Cajun dishes.. . When we arrived, the "bar" was nestled comfortably on the left of the casino. There were a few patrons in line, who didn't seem irritated or flabbergasted at the long wait, even though, I'm quite sure they waited for at least an hour or possibly, even longer. I think the  booze and cigarettes helped their moods :) I should've known this! :P. . TIP: This is not a sit-down restaurant where there's a waitress taking down names; it's much more informal -- when there's an empty chair or a chair opens up, the next patron waiting in line takes it. You wait in line until you're next up AND there are enough seats to accommodate your party. So keep in mind-- keep your parties small so that the line can easily keep on moving or you're left waiting for a LONG time (expect 2+ hours) if you have a bigger party.. . My boyfriend and I were fortunate that we stood in line with very friendly, cheery, funny, and obnoxious (in a positive way:) patrons that confided in us about the food and their experiences at the bar. It kept us company for a good 45 minutes. After many laughs and loud giggles, two chairs finally opened up for us! I felt like I won the lottery! :) I was that giddy.. . We both ordered the combo pan roast and received our orders in 30 minutes? I don't remember the exact wait time for the food because I was chatting it up with the patron next to me and my boyfriend :) Anyway, the chefs make the food in front of you, and sometimes, or maybe because I'm easily entertained, it's quite amusing to watch them. This helps the clock tick a bit faster. . . The pan roast with a small scoop of rice was absolutely perfect. Just everything -- its spices, the abundance of seafood in the bowl, and its portion, I felt like it was an experience that I didn't want to end. The food was on point that night. Next time (and my boyfriend promises me that there will be a next time), we will order oysters as the starter and share a combo pan roast. I was so full after the pan roast.. . I can't wait to relive this experience... but with drinks of course :)
The drive from LA to Vegas is brutal.  Well, not horrible, but sitting in a car for 3.5 - 4 hours deserves some kind of reward.. . When planning our Vegas trip, of course one of the first things we do is decide what and where we'll eat during the weekend.  This place was the first one on the list.  It had been on both of our bookmarks for a long while.  It seemed only fitting to treat ourselves to a delicious meal from Oyster Bar after our long drive from LA.. . We read the Yelp reviews and knew that we had to hit this place up when we got into town.  We would be arriving at about 1-2am, and according to the reviews, probably the best time to avoid the wait.  After searching the casino, we found this little tiny bar.  Yes people, the reviews are all true.  It's tiny.  It's basically a bar with seats around it (about 18 or so).  Get in line to be seated, and be prepared for a wait. . . Of course, by the time we were seated, we knew exactly what we were going to order.  One combo pan roast and 6 oysters.. . It was 2am in the morning, and I was struggling with the concept of sleep and enjoying my delicious meal.  But this meal was too amazing to pass up.  The oysters came, and my friend and I had three each.  Paired with the cocktail sauce and horseradish, those oyster were a great prelude to our meal.  The oysters were fresh and at $10 for 6 (midnight special), it was well worth it.. . The pan roast.  OMG the pan roast.  If you come here and can't decide what to order, just order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry.  My friend and I shared the plate.  There's a $5 sharing fee, but you get two scoops of rice instead of the one it's usually served with.  Besides, we could not have finished one each anyways.  We ordered a 5 level spicy, and that was good enough for me.  Not too spicy, just enough that you know there's some spice in the dish.  Yes, order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry!!. . Great meal for the start of our Vegas trip.
This place is L E G E N D A R Y. . . The wait for this place is pure torture. We waited a good hour before finally getting seated. Once seated, they make the food right in front of you one by one. There's very limited seating hence the long wait. If your lucky and you come at the right time (preferably after hours) you will not wait too long.. . We got the oysters to give us something to munch on while we wait for our entrees.. For our entrees we got the Pan Roast and Gumbo.. . The Pan roast is made up of lobster, shrimp, and other seafood in a thick, creamy tomato based stew with warm rice. I LOVE how they have levels of spiciness and you can make it as spicy as you want. YEA!. . The Gumbo wasn't as good as the Pan Roast. It tasted a little muddy and murky but it had lots of goodies inside like sausages. I won't be ordering the gumbo next time and will stick to the Pan Roast.
Combo Pan Roast was amaaazing. I will be sure to stop by whenever I'm in Vegas. Came here around 11am and there was no wait at all. They make all the food right in front of.
Wow.... I was SO sure I had already written a review on this place.... . . So, Oyster Bar... what can I say that hasn't already been said?  Probably not much. . . FIRST off, get over the fact that its located inside the Palace Station Casino.  That threw me for a loop the first time I went, but I easily got over it after the first spoonful of food.  . . SECOND, get over the fact that the seating is literally A BAR and very limited.  . . THIRD, get over the wait.  Ok, wait, let me rephrase.  If its 12-15 people deep, forget it and come back at 8am.  However, if only a handful, wait.  It's SO worth it.  . . I read the reviews and came here first with my cousin.  She wanted seafood I was game.  Though when I figured out what casino it was I was hesitant.  When I walked into the old casino I was like, oh geez... are we gonna get food poisoning?  However, we waited in line.  After about 40 minutes she and I were starving and ready to give up.  And the girl in front of us turned around and said it was worth the wait.  So.... given we had waited this long already we waited some more.  . . Pan roast...wtf is a pan roast?   I though it was a roast of beef or something.  Clueless I was!  We shared a combo pan roast, number 5 on spicy scale and a dozen oysters.  Sure... so I thought these massively large oysters were ridiculously altered genetically, but they were fresh and delicious....so I chomped my way through those. . . What can I say about the rest of the meal??? Um.. the first time I went here I was dizzy from elation.  I mean it looks like a tomatoey, cream based soup if nothing else.... but it is delectable!. . Went back to Vegas for Christmas after that visit and I dragged my unhappy husband there for lunch.  We tried to go the night before but at 1130pm, there was a retardedly long line which I estimated would not be a happy wait.  I was afraid too that our group would give out and end up at Subway around the corner!  So... lunchtime... grumbling husband about how this better be good.... . . We each got our separate soups (how greedy, huh). I got the combo pan roast, level 5, he got the etoufee, level 6 (Silly boy).  They were both yummy, but because the etoufee was too hot for us, we had to keep switching bowls to let the other person's mouth cool down.  Our group didn't come with us for this lunch...so they insisted on coming the next day.  Fast forward next day... at 830am we get there and voila, NO ONE.  Not one person was there, no line, nothing.  We sat right in the middle and the 4 of us proceeded to order our food.  As we were waiting for our stews to cook, all of the sudden the whole place was full of diners... lol.  So we figure the magic hour is between 8am and 9am.   The place is open 24 hours so you can experiment however you wish.  . . Hubby came back a month later for a conference.... dragged a couple more of his coworkers to eat here.  He tells me with glee that it was awesome.  OF COURSE IT WAS!  They are consistently good, always!  Bob cooked for us twice when we were in Vegas and I wish we could just package this stuff and take it home with us.  Wish they'd ship across the country.  Even if not exactly like the real thing, I'd even take something that comes close! . . Go and try... you won't regret it.
