I went there nearly 20 years ago when The Rio first opened and loved it. All I can say now is great desserts an salad. That's about it. I ate from eachof the ethnic choices and was disappointed with all of them. The food was either over cooked or under cooked. The prime rib was poor quality meat, the crab legs were sparse and the Mexican food didn't taste like Mexican. It tasted like spicy, dry dog food. The service was great but you can't eat service. I left full because at $31 a person you eat even if you force it down. All I can say is, "never again!"
Came for dinner. . . I really wanted to get crab legs on my trip to Vegas. The legs were really tiny, but I still enjoyed them. . . Dessert was disappointing. I liked the coconut gelato, but it seemed really frozen and not creamy. Nothing was labeled in the dessert section, so I accidentally grabbed carrot cake. It was dry. So was the cream cheese frosting. The strawberry tart tasted really artificial, like it was made of strawberry instant pudding. . . I liked the fried scallops and shrimp. . . I couldn't find soy sauce for my sushi. . . It's been a few days since I ate here, but I remember liking it. Everything is all kind of a blur because we did the Buffet of Buffets--ugh, never again.
I try to come to this buffet anytime I am in Vegas... I am not a big buffet fan, but I love the rio buffet b/c it has so many options!!! and a massive dessert/pastry bar/islands/section whatever you want to call.  They have it all... Mexican, Italian, Sushi, Pho, Chinese, American, Seafood, etc.... anything you're looking for, they'll probably have it.. . The price isn't that bad either when compared to the other buffets.... you also get a discount if you're a member of Caesar's Total Rewards program... it's free to sign up!
Rio has two buffets, at each end of the casino.  This was their first one and maybe the less popular one, but I think it's one of the better buffets.  Perhaps I should give the Seafood one a try.  What I remembered about this place was the stations, set up by ethnicity was pretty cool. Sure others have copied them, but 'm pretty sure they were the first. Like most buffet, some of the food was good and some weren't.  I'm not a fan of buffet, but getting sushi, although not great, is always a good thing.  Alaskan Crab legs is always a plus too.
Been to this buffet literally 50 times when they had 50% off for locals and I could get 50% off the lunch price coming in at 3:15pm and eat the dinner food...dinner would be around $8...5 stars, best deal in town. . . Now that they've increased the price a couple bucks and decreased the discount to locals at 25% it's just not worth it for what you get when there are WAY better buffets for just a few more bucks if you time it right.. . Snow crab legs are just dirty, small dried up things now...back in the day (2005) they had king crab and REAL prime rib,  not the thawed out and thrown in the oven salty roast beast every buffet serves up these days.. . If you like variety, this place is for you, but nothing stands out as phenomenal. . . If you come here and decide to pay full price, spend the $8 bucks more and go to Bellagio or Wynn...even Paris with a groupon (that has slipped recently). . . ...and if you are on vacation hit Bachannal Buffet at Caesar's. So many people come hereand blow tons of money on alcohol, the casino games and entertainment but seem to cut corners when it comes to food. . . Skip this one...
great food decent price lot of choices
We read that this one was good and we had the Buffet of Buffets pass, so we took the shuttle from Bally's to check it out for dinner.. . It was another average Vegas buffet for me. Nothing was really memorable other than the fact that it's massive. It literally would take a couple minutes to walk from end to end. The food was just OK though. . . We won't likely be back, especially since it's off The Strip. I should add that the staff was all friendly.
Came here for the $29.99 dinner buffet with the bf. For dinner, they do have a spectacular selection from pasta, pizza, hot and cold crab legs, Asian noodle station, Chinese food, Mexican food, salads, and dessert. But be disappointed with their sushi selection. I think there were three, maybe four rolls out.  . . I tried their carnitas, smoked ham, calamari... All Not too bad. But I suppose I didn't come here for quality. However, I think they do reallllly well with Asian food. Some of the best duck and pork bellies I've had!!!  Ok, the best five spice duck I've had!  Pho was ok- I even put duck and pork bellies in it to  try and enhance the flavor, which worked for a minute. . . Sooo dessert- if I based this review on the fact that they didn't have banana cream pie, I would have given them two stars. How ever, I have to say their dessert selection was good. But was it tasty?! Not so much. Of the two dozen or so dessert options, I was only a fan of their banana fosters and tiramisu gelato. Red velvet cupcake was stale. Eclair was ok.  . . So would I go back and pay $30 again? Probably not.  maybe $21.99
Looked up buffets and was one of the few that seemed abit above average in vegas . We were a group of 10  payed 32 dollars each for something we expected to be good . We were wrong  it was alot taking into account the food was HORRIBLE.Tried the different varieties of food American Asian , Mexican there was not one that i completely  ate because the food was so bad . The only plate of food I had was a salad, and a waffle . Don't get me wrong there is a huge selection of but the quality is just terrible Don't recommend it especially if you don't want to walk out with a stomach Ache
I don't usually review these places, but standards are so pre recession!! Drum roll!!! No but seriously this was a bad ass buffet in terms of selection. They had a very eclectic one at that, I liked the concept if the noodle bar where you could get pho, ramen, wonton soup or some other kind of Asian noodle dish you create , basically like a subway.  They had pork belly which I thought was cool, some pretty good meats at the carving station, and tons of other things that I can't go into detail on because of the drunken nature of the moment. With that said the desert bar was slammin!  Mid go back here in a heartbeat  if it's a 24 hour wait at all the other high end buffets!
