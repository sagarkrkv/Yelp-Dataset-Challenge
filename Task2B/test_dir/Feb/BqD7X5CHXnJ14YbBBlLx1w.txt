Thanks to religiously watching Top Chef for the last eleven seasons, I'm just not a fan of Julian Serrano. In the most recent season, he built a Spanish menu against his the awesome Dominique Crenn, and every one of his dishes looked so boring that nobody was rooting for his team.. . Fast forward to visiting Las Vegas with the idea of gorging myself on everything tasty that the city has to offer ... and I decided to visit Julian's eponymous restaurant for kicks (and to prove to myself that I was right in judging him from what I've seen on Top Chef). And you know what? I was wrong. I give this restaurant a solid 3.5 stars and appreciate what Serrano is doing to heighten Las Vegas' culinary caliber.. . I think the decor is fun; trendy, whimsical and colorful. Kind of like tapas :). . If you're getting tapas, it's important to get around three things per person and share, so that you get the max out of your experience. Here are the highlights:. . -- heirloom tomato salad. -- coca vegetarian. -- yellowtail tiradito. -- stuffed piquillo peppers. . Why wasn't it rated higher? One of our items was "lost" off the check, and we waited for 20-30 minutes even after letting them know. Second, while some of the food is great, other items like the chicken croquetas were downright dogs.. . Nonetheless, I'm happy that JS had vindicated himself in my eyes ... I'm sure he'll sleep better at night now.
This place never disappoints. Amazing food, good service, and a beautiful modern design.. . Our waiter was very helpful. Since I had been here before and it was the first time for my friends, I was picking some of the tapas I knew and liked. He suggested other tapas too. The service was fast. Our tapas were brought to our table sooner than expected. My top favorites were the Creamy Risotto, Garlic Chicken, Papas Bravas, Pan Manchego, and Traditional Chicken Croquetas. The dessert, Churros with spicy chocolate was so delicious and brought back some childhood memories. . . Julian Serrano has a beautiful modern design. It very colorful and lively. The restrooms are cover from top to bottom in tiny mosaic multicolor tile. Plus the restrooms play Spanish lessons.. . I highly recommend Julian Serrano!! It's a must try! This is one of my top favorite restaurants.
My second time at Julian Serrano.  The atmosphere is great being in the atrium area of the Aria Hotel.. . Service is good, but almost too fast.  At a tapas place, you order a bunch of small plates and eat them throughout the evening.  During our dinner, they brought all the plates at once.  Our table was overloaded with plates.  Since we wanted to eat everything while it was hot, it turned out to be a short dinner.  . . The desserts are fair - nothing special.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant , got seated and never saw our server whatsoever.
Vegas is a foodie town, and Aria has a lot of wonderful restaurants.  If you ask me, Julian Serrano is the best restaurant in Aria and it's one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.. . I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.  . . Service is top-notch and fast.  For a party of 14, I was worried about the wait time for food.  No need to worry, they know what they're doing!  Food started coming out almost immediately.  Tapas are a terrific option for large groups.  The pace of dishes coming out was perfect.  Also our waiter was able to split up the bill (we ordered in groups of 3 to 5 people).  . . Finally, the food.  It's excellent!!  Everything is amazing but I particularly recommend the calamari, which is among the best I've ever eaten.  Other notable dishes include the salmon, the risotto, croquetas, peppers, papas bravas.. . You simply cannot go wrong eating here.
Bit pricey, but it's delicious.  And hey it's Vegas.... . We ordered too many things to remember but for the most memorable things were:. . . Tuna Cones - Delicious tuna sushi (poke) style in crispy cones.. Imported Spanish Serrano Ham - Delicious period.. Creamy Risotto - Very well done!. Stuffed Dates - Not bad.. Grilled Lamb Chop - Loved it.. Mixed Paella - Very good paella.  Had low expectations but wow'd.. . I would come here again but give it sometime so they can add and subtract from menu.. . Worth the try!
Fantastic...amazing flavors....Aurora made this a special lunch...ask to sit in her area
Tapas are amazing with a lot of variety to choose from. The scallops, oxtail, and risotto is amazing. Good service and amazing food.
Superlative food. The ceviche is wonderful, as well as the shrimp. You can taste the freshness and quality. The wine list sources some of the better Spanish labels, which pair well. My only knock was that my wife was bumped several times by the wait staff, due to the narrow passage between tables.  We mentioned this to our waitress, and there was no make good or acknowledgement. Not what I expected from a world class chef.
Overall great experience. The mixed seafood ceviche was amazing! I wish the portion was a bit larger. I would definitely come back! I also tried the paella which was also delicious.
As a frequent visitor to Vegas, I have had the opportunity to dine here three times in the last five months.  If you like Tapas, you will love this place.  I cannot say anything bad about the food, it is all wonderful: dates, octopus, short rib, paella, etc.  The paella is a little small for a large group. I heartily recommend the churros for dessert.  My only criticisms are that the wine list is always out of the reasonably priced selections and the general cost of a meal is ridiculous.  I know, every meal in Vegas has to be ridiculously overpriced, it is some kind of law, but go in prepared to have to use the home equity line.. . Still, I cannot recommend this place enough.
Delicious tapas. Portions a bit small so go with 3/person (they suggest 2-3/person). Loved everything we got: bacon wrapped figs, goat cheese and tomato cake, cheese platter, mushroom risotto, scallops, and chicken croquetas. Red sangria was perfect... Not excessively sweet but flavorful and fruity.
This is the best tapas place I have been to.  Great service! Friendly staff for being packed to capacity.  We were here with a party of 22.  They took the time to explain what was in each dish. I recomend the Scallops, best I have ever had.  They have a. Limited beer selection, but I still give it a 5 star.
Went to Julian Serrano with a bachelorette party - about 16 of us and we had a great time! Unfortunately, they were unable to seat us all together, but they did get us two tables close together.  We got a couple pitchers of each the red and white sangria which was very good.  We then asked the waiter to bring us out an assortment of the most popular tapas. Everything was delicious with my favorites being the avocado cannelloni, the stuffed dates and the brava potatoes. Fun atmosphere and good service.
Stick with the Tapas and bottled water. Looking forward to a special birthday dinner here we were very disappointed. . We started out grand , quaint table for two and we are already ordering our drinks. Gin & tonic came out and it tasted off by the 3rd try the drink was brought out with just the gin and a closed bottle of tonic water. The tonic was spoiled at the bar. . We loved the tapas we ordered very tasty, perfect for two. The fig tapas were just lovely! Now we are excited about the paella we ordered. When it arrived we noticed immediately it was small not really for two. Only two shrimps and maybe a scoop of rice each - oh! It smelled so fishy I was hesitant to eat it but took a bite and wish I hadn't! The rice was under cooked and the shrimp tasted bad. Really could not continue, we ask the server to take it away and I've lost my appetite. . My water is refilled and I notice large particles floating in my glass! Ugh. I ask for bottled water and tell our server why. She does apologize and we know this is not her fault. The manager comes over and starts to explain why the paella taste so off and this is just how they make it here, he does not apologize or offer anything to us. I am beyond ready to leave. But our server lets us know because it is my birthday she will bring me dessert and she is convinced I will be delighted. She brings out a lava cake, where am I, Applebee's?!! Please, just let me leave! But first she brings me the check. They took off the Paella and bottle of water. Finally it ended.
Used to be my favorite place for tapas until now.  Found a piece of bone on my tapa, they took the plate with the piece of bone to the kitchen but instead of having the courtesy of offering something else they just became very prompt in handing me the check before I even asked for it.  Guess is all fun and games until someone chokes or loses a tooth to a piece of bone...  Eat at your own risk!. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i
VERY overpriced but yummy!!!! I guess this is what I can expect in Vegas. I tried about 8 different tapas and I absolutely loved the ceviche with taro chips.  Just that will complete your night!
We always prefer tapa restaurants back in seattle, becasue we love getting variety of foods in one sitting. After seeing this restaurant near our hotel entrance, we decided to give it a try. . . We went straight to eat after the morning workout. It wa pretty empty on sunday morning around 11am. . . We had asparagus, beef tartare,steak, and sliders. The sauce that came wth roasted asparagus was one of my favorite thing. It had almond flavor to it, and I enjoyed it alot. Steak was tender and juicy, tartare was fresh. The tartare came with thing sliced root vegetables and  i thought it was a interesting addition. Sliders were great as well.. . The price wasn't that bad and i loved the experience. The only thing is, it isn't a closed restaurant, and you are dirextly exposed to people walking by when sitted near the edge of the restaurant.
This place is ok. Not sure why this place have so many 5 star reviews? Maybe we went on an off night? The service was kinda blah as well. Hub and I shared the following tapas:. . ***Recommend***. . Stuffed paquillo peppers (my fav there, the flavors went very well together). . Oxtail (sorry forgot the name. It was hub's fav, tender and moist). . Seared scallops (seared perfectly). . Yellowtail (this was ok, didn't think it was that bad to be added to the list below). . Lamb chops (hub and I both enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best we ever had). . ***Avoid at all cost***. . Tuna cone (no flavor). . Fried artichoke (forgot the name as well, but it came with arugula and some kind of soft cheese on the side. This dish was completely bland and the flavors did not work well together). . Tuna and raspberry stick (looks pretty, but where was the flavor?!). . Fries and chorizo with egg on top (can't believe we paid for this dish. It looked like a dish that was thrown in with leftovers). . Pork shoulder (forgot the name as well. It was dry and bland and totally not worth it). . Bill came out to be about $180. It wasn't too bad, but I can think of a million other places where I would've left happy and completely satisfied.
