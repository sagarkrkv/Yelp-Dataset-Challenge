This place is a joke. We got charged $45pp for a holiday (Chinese New Year). Last time I checked I don't have off for that "holiday" and neither do the schools. The food was horrible. The crab legs were so thin with hardly any meat inside them, the sushi was nasty, there was no variety of Italian food but plenty of variety of Asian food. The bread was hard and just crumbled when I tried to butter my roll. Dessert was a little better but still needs improvement. I would never go to this buffet again if it was free. Save your money and go to the buffet at the M it's so much better.
Four stars for being gluten friendly. That's pretty legit. Every little substation tells you if there are any gluten-free options in their area. It wasn't perfectly explained... meaning, you kind of have to walk around a bit to understand what you can and can't eat... but once you get the hang of it, blammo.. . I don't usually use that word but I figured it was a good time to start. Blammo.. . The dessert area was dope. The crab legs were a lot of work, as expected. The paella was bomb. Actually, it wasn't paella. It was jambalaya. Still. Super bomb.. . Bathrooms were nice. Hostesses were kinda meh. Overall, I'd come back if I was in the ARIA and I wanted to gain five or six pounds.
Oh man, where to start this sad story? The only thing worth mentioning are the dumplings in the Asian station everything else was lack luster. The fried rice tasted more like paella than fried rice and the noodle soup might as well been a carnival game since there was no ways to get any noodle in your bowl. . . The carving station offered a brisket that could have only been prepared by a rookie since it had no smoke ring and was as tough as a rubber sole. . . Stay clear of the Latin station everything was over cooked. . . Didn't try the fish market but seeing crawfish on ice told me everything I need to know. . . Dessert were good.
Their buffet is Superior!. . Let me start by saying its worth it's price if you are hungry or had a special or it's comped during your stay. The food / service are amazing, they steamed by iced seafood which made me smile. The crab legs come in half cut so no need to fight your way from the to the claw, just peel or fork it all up. Comes cold or steamed. They have all types of food from the seafood section to like a wheel of fortune ice-crew, the sliced beef was so juicy as well and always ask for an extra slice. If the line is long and your staying there, try to go through the sky suites line and charge to your room. A little perk to get inside as the other just sit and wait, tip your mimosa cup and carry on!. . Amazing feature: all you can drink beer and cocktails (picture below) it's about $15 and to start your day go to the lunch buffet and come pre-game there!
*sigh* Now let me start by saying I'm a native Las Vegan so I am basically a buffet expert. This buffet is sorry. The only reason my mom and I came here was because we received a 2 for 1 voucher for lunch. Literally the only two things I remember about this buffet are the crab legs and the clam chowder. If I come here again it's gonna be strictly for the crab. For the Aria to be so beautiful and one of the newer properties on the strip, I was very disappointed. Their prices need to come down about $10 before I go there again. It just wasn't worth it. I see why they were giving out 2 for 1 comps.. . I did appreciate that the crab legs were already opened and that you could get them steamed or cold. That was really nice.
We saw all the mixed reviews and were a little hesitant, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The nan station was awesome. Seafood was pretty fresh. Overall everything was pretty good. The only thing that wasn't great was some of the desserts were really dry, like the coconut macaroons for example. The two whoopie pies were really good though.  I wanted to try the gelato but was too stuffed!
It was ok. Th crab legs are split which makes it to where you have to eat twice as many. Everything else was pretty standard. Honestly you can get the same thing at harrahs but cheaper.
Good food, and an excellent dessert selection, but not worth paying over $40/person for the gourmet dinner on the weekends. I was expecting quite a bit more selection or higher quality for that price.
I eat gluten free 100% of the time.  I have to, or I get sick for 48 hours :(  Buffets are usually a nightmare, but how amazing is this place?  An ample variety of gluten free labeled dishes (including dessert!  tiramisu!) and care to avoid cross contamination.  . . This is what I ate:. gluten free pizza. chicken curry with basmati rice. salmon. tzatziki w/vegetables. fruit. turkey breast. broccolini. mashed potatoes. tiramisu. . It was all fresh and well-seasoned.  Best buffet experience ever! I didn't do the $12.99 bottomless beverages because it wasn't that kind of trip, but I'd be more than happy to add grapefruit mimosas to my next visit.  . . The restaurant is also clean, spread out, modern and open feeling.  Our server was AMAZING - I always had a fresh glass of iced tea with a new lemon in front of me.  Will definitely be back, I go to LV 1-2/x year and I think I just found a new go-to buffet.
From 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:. . Food - 3. Service - 4. Price - 2. . There are much better buffets than this one.  Food was pretty good, but the selection was not very good.  I'm not a picky Eater and it was hard to find food that looked good.  I would give it a 2, but I just didn't like the selection that much.
I don't know where to start first. My wife and I ate her on Valentine's Day and was very disappointed. First the aria is a beautiful property so we thought the buffet would be awesome as well. We wanted to do a fine dining restaurant but the lines were long and some you needed a reservation. We should of looked at the lay out before we paid. Let's start at the meat station, they were carving hot dogs rolled in some sort of dough that. The salads at the salad station wasn't cold and the fish market had crayfish on Ice that wasn't seasoned. The only good thing about the crayfish was the chef cooking them for us and adding some more seasonings. I had to wait sometime because when I asked the cook he said let me get the chef. Didn't understand that when I saw him cooking fish on the grill already. But all in all it was probably better the chef cooked them anyway because I didn't see anyone washing there hands. The chef was very pleasing and paid close attention to our needs. Chef T was the high point of our experience there. Thanks a bunch. The desserts were the best thing they had going. By passed the Asian and Italian so I can't say much about those areas. Highly disappointed and would not return.
Went here week day for lunch... About $25.  Split snow crab legs, hot and cold... loved it. mussels, clams,good,  craw-fish was too much work,  Asian dim sum, OK, fish and chips, lots of ice cream and desserts, gotta go back the next trip.  Too full to go to the carving station.  They drop off a thermos of coffee, don't have to find them for a refill....
The Buffet at the ARIA is not too shabby. I admit, compared to the numerous buffets in Las Vegas, the Buffet doesn't stand out, however, there are a definitely things that one will love about this buffet.. . Now this review was during Saturday Brunch on Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend. The regular brunch price is $29.99 per person but they decided to increase the price to $35.99 due to the holiday weekend. This was sneaky on their part to raise prices just for the weekend, but I realized $5 wasn't a big deal in Vegas (especially when you have a $50 room credit). It's also convenient for those staying at the ARIA. The line was nonexistent at 9:30a but grew after we left. Still, the line was not ridiculously long.. . The Buffet is modern as you would expect walking into the ARIA. There are windows all around so it's quite bright. The decor & furniture also help make the entire restaurant bright. The waiter service was just okay. My orange juice order was forgotten but plates were removed at a reasonable amount of time. I do love that they give you a large pitcher of coffee instead of having to flag the waiter down for a refill.. . Overall, they have a good selection of foods. You can find Chinese, Indian, Korean, American, Mexican, Italian, French, and even Filipino food here. Their Asian foods were probably my favorite as they had Filipino longanisa (sausage) and their kimchi fried rice was delicious! They also have a legit tandoori oven to bake the naan. I really appreciate the gluten free options but I did find those dishes to be a bit bland. Most will appreciate that their snow crab legs are already cut in half. Although this saves the mess and time, I definitely feel more satisfied cracking open a crab leg myself. I also think that this dries out the crab meat. Speaking of dry, I found that a lot of their dishes were a bit dry possibly due to overcooking. Their desserts are quite good. I especially loved their revolving gelato machine. Other desserts one should try are their pecan pie and flan.. . The Buffet at the ARIA met my expectation and was decent enough with the room credit. I do wish that some of their dishes were more flavorful and less dry. I don't see myself going out of my way to eat at this particular buffet though.
This buffet was delicious. They had all sorts of food and desserts. The staff was very helpful and willing to go above and beyond for you. Place is really nice, everything is delicious.
This review is for breakfast. I tend to only do buffets in Vegas and I never give 5 stars but I just couldn't believe my eyes when we walked in at 0930 and there was an entire seafood section with jumbo shrimp and crawfish and mussels and clams and the list goes on.. . But the real highlight were the best har gow I've ever had. I ate10 bucks worth of har gow.  If eating jumbo shrimp is not your thing for breakfast, then try the omelette station, the waffle station, the list goes on. We ate at Spices the day before and there is just no comparison.  Had we upgraded to the alcohol package they had premium wines to choose from for just 12.99 additonal to the 19.99 buffet. The coffee was delicious and when you consider that just one starbucks black is 4 bucks, this buffet is a steal.. . Their almond croissants with marzipan were out of this world.
I think a review of 3 for a ok is about right.    The prime rib was pretty good vs other places I've tried.  I didn't try their other carved meats like their chicken, brisket, ham etc however they all looked delicious.  The mac and cheese and other sides were amazing.. . Reason i only give it a 3 is because for a buffet to get anything higher i think the food should not taste like "buffet" food.   Especially when your dropping 40 to 50 bucks including tax and tip.   Some buffets do this.   Aria doesn't.   I think for less money you could go to any of the lower end hotels and still get the same buffet and same food.  Aside from the carved meat station and the seafood (crab legs and peeled shrimp) everything else wasn't even good it was average at best.   Mexican food stale.  Asian food stale and horrible.   The rest were standard things like fried chicken breasts potato wedges etc.. . If your gonna come here go straight to the carved meats (rotisserie chicken, prime rib, brisket, etc).  Otherwise if your looking for the same quality but save some money go to planet hollywood or anywhere else its cheaper.. . I still think rio buffet was one if the best I've had.
This is one expensive lunch buffet at $35 a person and does not deliver. For starters they are very slow to seat you, even though it appeared that 1/3 of the seats were open. . I thought the selection was just lacking, they had a mediterranean sections but only had dipping sauces with no pita or pita chips.  In addition they had no meats in their mediterranean sections; I was hoping to see kebabs of some sort.  Also the naan maker was broken so that didn't help their score either.  . . The dessert bar is actually awesome with a great selection; and is the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars not 1.   . . I would recommend skipping this buffet and eating at one of many celebrity chefs options in Vegas.
*Food Allergy Review*. . They had a great selection of Gluten Free items.  All GF items had an asterisk next to the name.  Pizza, desserts, Italian, India, Latin, etc. all had GF options, and they were all very tasty.  It's good to know that there's a reliable place I can go to when I'm in Vegas.
Great for breakfast.  Good selection of items for everyone.  Fresh and hot items too.  For about $20 pp, it's a better deal than buying from the hotel cafe market where a breakfast sandwich is already $14.
The Aria Buffet is excellent for those that want the taste of a fine restaurant but also want the ease and assortment that you will find in a buffet. Their stations are manned with an exceptional number of employees and are always in stock with their items. This is your chance to pair foods from their tastes. For example I had the Spanish rice with cilantro with my salmon from the seafood section. They also had 3 different types of crab legs! I don't usually eat pie but when I saw their apple pie next to their assortment of ice cream flavors, I just had to have dessert. . . The only thing is it was a little in the pricey end as it came out to $80 for two but you're at the Aria what did you expect?
Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 11/100. . I'll go down on an avalanche with this one and say that seafood and exotic food - mediteranean & indian - lovers, you will love this place. Baba Ghanoush, lamb curry, king crab legs, mussels, clams etc. are scattered along the recently renovated buffet area and you have the whole left portion of the aisle for dessert. This is where I come in.. . Over the years, I've trained myself two disciplines at the buffet 1) eat a small portion of everything 2) get cookies and flan for appetizers, salad for first main course and the carbs for second main! I mean it's not all the time we go to a buffet so number 2 happens more often than I'd want it to. What I'm trying to say is, you do not want to miss out on dessert at the strip buffets, aria is no exception.. . On top of getting fancy with the food names, aria offers a good round of high quality sweets for comparatively less than what you'd pay for it you got them individually outside. I wasn't too crazy about the salads though, and the fact that there was a lonely toaster by the bread area.  Mommy thought it was an artistic touch - take it from someone who loves being in the kitchen. Papa stuck to getting some crab legs in every round. I got cookies for appetizers, he got crabs. We're almost always this way. . . Thankfully, I'm bent on keeping my cookie cravings to 2013. Next trip here, I may actually try the salad. Mmm actually, let me give this place a 3.6, pretty much because I kept wishing they had more variety of sushi - maybe salmon, sweet egg etc. Next one to try is the Paris buffet but that's probably set for later this year.
I went to the Aria buffet for the first time last night.. I honestly can't comment on the price, as a friend paid for the dinner.. . I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  It was bright, and open, and very appealing.  . . The server was polite when taking drink orders and clearing plates.. . The selection was very impressive.  Curries, sushi, pizza, meats, and LOTS of seafood.. . The quality of the food was standard buffet quality, except for the seafood.  I really didn't care for any of it.  The mahi mahi was cold...not even lukewarm, but cold.  The New Zealand mussels were chewy, and the seafood jambalaya was REALLY fishy.. . I was very impressed with the fact that they have so many gluten free options.  Everything is well labeled, so there really isn't much guesswork.. . My favorites of the night were the salad, the risotto, all the food at the Tandoori station (curries, etc), the chicken pot stickers, and the mac n cheese.. Now, I have to tell you..the pasta was WAY overcooked and it was kind of mushy, but that's how I like my "comfort food" style mac n cheese.  I actually went back for seconds.  . . The desert station was huge, and beautiful.  I only had room for a bite or two of cheesecake but that was good too.. . I probably would not go back, because I hear that its a fairly expensive buffet, and I'm cheap.  But if you have $30-$50, the quality of the food is pretty standard.
