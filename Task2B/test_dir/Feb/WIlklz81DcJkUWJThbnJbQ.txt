Came to Vegas for one night, and the Vdara was one of the only hotels with rooms left that also didn't have the price jacked up for Super Bowl Sunday. We paid about $200.. . This hotel is new. it's clean, it's right next to Aria and Cosmo. And the room was awesome. This hotel is also doggie friendly :) Although I did not have one with me this time! I did have some help falling asleep by the name of Grey Goose, but I know that the bed was, in fact, super comfy. This hotel may stay a pretty good little secret for a little bit longer, since there is no casino inside, so go stay there now! I hope to do so again! . . Wi-fi included in reservation, and a cute bar in the lobby!. . I think my biggest regret is not having time to soak in the enormous tub.
What a joke. I booked this hotel through Jetsetter.com. Picture me checking in when the front desk person announces because I went through Jetsetter I will receive no services while staying in the room. That means no towels, no turndown services, no cleaning of the room. In essence for $505 I get to camp out for three days. What a joke. I even put my light on requesting services but their communications with staff must be excellent because I saw NO ONE in the three days I was there. My fiends at the Cosmo and Aria would call everyday and ask if I needed anything. I would tell them I just went shopping for toilet paper and towels and now I was going to vacuum. The hotel is nice, just don't book it through Jetsetter. I contacted Jetsetter and was told the NO SERVICES was in the contract. I have it in front of me right now and trust me when I say nothing is said about NO SERVICES. Just heard Tripadvisor just bought them so I would be careful.. . Cheers,. Barry Cioffi
Ihad a beautiful suite. I was in town for a trade show and I loved coming back to my comfy luxe suite at the end of a long day to convalesce!
We chose the Vdara for one of our several much needed respites from daily life for a fabulous, romantic, Vegas experience.  Now I must preface all of this with this fun fact - I am NOT your typical Vegas goer but I LOVE Vegas.  I don't gamble, barely drink and can't stand the smell of cigarettes.  Yet there is something that brings me back here time and again. So if you must have a thick wafting of cigarette smoke and a loud, hopping casino in your hotel, the Vdara may not be for you.. . I found the Vdara to be simply  wonderful!  Clean, fresh, smoke free air abounds in this tranquil, upscale hotel. The bed?  Sooooo comfortable I did not want to get out of it.  The soaking tub, ahhhhh, wonderful!  The service - impeccable.  And we loved being able to walk around City Center. No need for an overpriced taxi that smells like last night's vomit.  There were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping in City Center to keep us from ever having to venture on to the strip.  Oh and the quiet.  That was the best part.  No screaming gaggles of drunk girls parading up and down the halls at 3:00 a.m.  It felt like we were the only guests in the hotel until we stepped out of the elevator and into the lobby. And as an aside, we did take our car out and ventured down Industrial Road to find some really cool, vintage Vegas shops...and while you're at it, for a great bowl of ramen, head over to Monta Ramen on Spring Mountain Road where you won't be gouged, just pleasantly filled up with delicious, aromatic noodles and broth!. . Complaints?  Minimal really.  The air conditioner in our room was a bit temperamental but two lovely service men took care of the problem efficiently enough.  The cafe downstairs boasts "Frozen Yogurt" on the wall but alas...the machines were removed so we took a quick walk to Pinkberry just down the road. And the cool, swinging lounge chairs at the bar...occupado when I wanted to try them out but I guess great minds think alike so I definitely won't hold that against the hotel.  I loved, loved, loved my stay there and will be back for sure!
Vdara is a great value and centrally located, in particular it's great if you are attending a convention at the Bellagio because of the connection from Vdara to the conference center. The staff is friendly and the lack of a casino makes it really easy to stay at; only downside, it is starting to look a little worn in the rooms.
Awesome hotel.  Best thing about it is that it is smoke free and no casino.  We stayed in a corner suite with separate kitchen and 1.5 baths.  View of Bellagio fountains and skyline was gorgeous.  We had a long wait for our room as we arrived early but hung around the Lounge areas and cafe.  Service at check in was very good.  Would not hesitate to stay here again.  Walking distance to the strip was approx 20 mins.
ROOMS: BEAUTIFUL.  I had a suite with a 270 degree view. it was pretty amazing.  I loved the windows.  There was a full kitchen and even a washer/dryer.  I loved the dual sinks too.  They had condo specs for sure.. . LOCATION: It's situated along the center of the strip but offset so it's not directly on LV blvd.  It was very quiet and that was nice.. . SERVICE: Disappointing.  Housekeeping came to our room at 10am and we were still tired from the night before so we sent her away.  Before leaving the room we called at noon to send housekeeping.  We also turned on the housekeeping light that shows in front of your door that you want the room cleaned. When we left we saw someone a few doors down and thought we'd get taken care of. 5 hours later and they just started in our room.  We were tired from walking and had reservations to get to.  So we went to the bar since there was nothing to do.. . The bartender we had was socially awkward, rude, or was offended by us or something because we were very friendly to her and she looked at us like we were bothering her when WE are her customer.  We tried to get her attention to order food and it took a while for any acknowledgement.  She also told someone else to make our drinks.  It was NOT busy at the bar btw.  . . When we got back to the room we had to rush to get ready and head off to our reservation.  I REALLY did not like that.  I hate rushing.  They were busy this weekend but hello?  Schedule more people to work if you know it's President's Day/Valentine's weekend.  We also CALLED to request housekeeping AND turned on the light. That was not great.  If we are going to pay that much for a room at Vdara we would expect comparable service to the prestige of the hotel.  I felt ignored during the whole trip.  The employees either hate their jobs or they do not focus on exceptional service. I felt like I could get the same or better service at The Gap. . . We are from la and visit Vegas often and are trying each hotel to find the favorite.  Vdara is a definite NO on that list.  The room was very nice but I would not recommend Vdara to anyone because there are MANY hotels with nice rooms.  I was looking forward to staying there for a while now and was very disappointed with what I got.  . . WHY 2 STARS:  Great rooms and the quiet feel was nice since there was no smoking or gaming. Service was not good.
This is probably more 3.5 stars in actuality. . . Stayed here over Valentine's day weekend and it was an average stay. We have stayed at many places on the strip and this place is clean and nice but nothing spectacular. The bed was comfy, location was central to the things we were doing, it was no-smoking and it was rarely congested. However the staff was not very friendly, water pressure was poor and there wasn't a lot to do/access within the hotel itself (sure, it's close to other things). While waiting to check out the staff was letting certain people go to the front of the line while others were rudely told to just wait their turn. While storing our luggage the bellman approached and asked if I needed help. I told him "I just need to store this luggage" and he said "so you need help then." Ummm.....sure. . . Overall, this was a good stay but it didn't blow me away. Given that there are so many other new and nice places to stay I probably wouldn't choose to stay here again.
We stayed here for a couple of nights in early February.  I found a decent rate at hotels.com and wanted to try a hotel that is centrally located and one that is adjacent to, rather than integrated with a casino.. . Overall, out stay was wonderful and the room (more like a suite) was large and comfortable, with a view of the strip.  It reminded me of an upscale Residence Inn, with a small living from and two flat screen TVs.  Beds were super comfortable and the bathroom spacious.  . . The lobby area is also nice with Starbucks and breakfast places along with a bar.  There is also easy access to Bellagio by a short walkway while you can go outside and access Cosmo.. . Would definitely recommend staying here on the future - it's simply a nice relaxing place to stay.  Makes you feel like a high roller :)
This hotel had good things and not so good.  . . The good:  smoke free!!!   In Vegas, that is a good thing.  The room was clean, the staff was pleasant.  The beds were pretty comfy.  The bar downstairs was good.  Smoke free again.. . the bad:  housekeeping wasn't great.  They forgot to bring water, and they didn't make up the room on the last day of our stay.  Not good at all.. . Would I stay there again?  No....  There are too many other places in Vegas that are better.
Excellent quiet, young adult, non smoking atmosphere. The suites are beautiful contemporary decor. This hotel is in the heart of the strip. A must visit with a VERY special person.
We recently stayed here while my husband attended a conference.  It was a wonderful experience.. . Cab fare was $20 from the airport which I don't feel is bad at all.  The hotel staff was very nice upon arrival and we were able to easily check our bags as we got in early.  Check in was very easy as well.  We requested a high room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains (per the suggestion of other Yelp reviews) and were not disappointed.  When we came back later in the day, our room was ready and waiting.  The hotel is not your average Vegas hotel.  There is not a slot machine to be found and it is free of cigarette smoke which we liked very much.  We do like to gamble though and were able to walk right around the front circle to Aria to their casino but it was nice each evening to come back to our quite hotel.  Vdara is so close to many other hotels and casino's as well, definitely within walking distance.  They have a great little place for breakfast/lunch/desserts/coffee and also a hotel bar and Starbucks.  The only downside is that both the little restaurant and Starbucks close early so after a night of shows and roaming Vegas, if you want a bite to eat or a cup of coffee, you will want to pick it up on your way back.  I really feel that these should be open 24 hours as pretty much everything in Vegas is 24 hours.. . Our suite was very clean and comfortable.  Huge windows offer great views but there are also automatic blinds that, at the push of a button, give you privacy or douse the lights of Vegas.  Having two bathrooms was great and having the garden tub in one was wonderfully relaxing after a day of walking.  . . There is a coffee maker, however, they only leave 2 k-cups (1 decaf/1 caf) each day so if you want coffee you may want to bring your own or I'm sure you could request more as they are very accommodating.  There is an ice maker and a microwave/convection oven and a stove top.  Loved the washer and dryer as we were easily able to get the wrinkles out of our clothes before we went out for the day or evening.. . When we checked out we had a late flight, so again, we checked our bags and picked them back up on the way back to the airport.  No hassle whatsoever.  All-in-all a great trip and we will definitely stay here again!
Sure Vdara.... Im all in ... the price is right .... the rooms are new.... great gym......I would love to stay at your hotel. One problem, call to make reservation, get on hold for a while, I'm used to it.... Then I get some annoying bitter "reservationist" who asks me 20 questions when all I am trying to do is get a true quote for the room and book it.. Hint.. Yes sir is the answer ... take my credit card and get me a key so I can get on with my life.. Tell your jackass marketing dept to suck.. 20 questions gets you exactly one less customer, but who needs that.. City Center is no ghost town or anything.. Oh well, on to the next 170,000 rooms available in town.. Ugh. BTW, I love this trend of charging everybody "RESORT FEE" . $25 use it or not, I am personally starting a protest.. Oh well Vegas takes it one way or another, but Vdara will not take mine today.. Oh yeah, there is a hotel across the street, gotta go.
I loved staying at this hotel because it has so many nice touches....It starts when you drive up the ramp and at night the Vdara gives off a futuristic feel. The bell and valet service were super courteous, and the check in process was simple and quick.  . . Once I got to my room I called the bell service, and within 5 minutes my bags were delivered and was also given instruction on how to work the blinds in the room from the Bell Attendant. . . All I can say is wow! The view we had in our room was amazing and it overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  Overall the room is super clean, modern and chic; which the wife just loved.  . . I had requested plates and silverware to be delivered and this took almost 20-30 minutes. Which I thought was a bit slow, compared to the other services.. . I had requested late checkout which they granted, and once again the Bell service was very prompt to come up and grab our luggage. . . Overall we had a great stay here.  Next time I visit Vegas, this is on my top 3 list of hotels I would  stay at.
Love that it is a non-gambling/non-smoking hotel. This makes for a more refreshing, quiet ambience. It is not directly on the strip (located behind Aria, which is on the strip) which I enjoyed. You don't run into the busy, tourist commotion, like other hotels.. Free valet parking, for guests. Hotel guests also get free admission into HAZE night club, located in the Aria hotel. The room was great! Amzung view if the water show at the Bellagio It had a kitchenette,  The room could have been a tad bit cleaner. We noticed greasy hand prints on the dining room chairs, and hair in out tub, (not a big deal if youre not OCD, like me). The sofa bed mattress felt like fabric over springs, so we ended up not using it.. Overall, it is a great place to stay. I will definatley be coming back
Love this hotel! It was our first time staying here and my group and I definitely had a great experience. Since the hotel is non-smoking and does not include a casino to it, it was a lot less crowded and a lot more fresh-smelling. Also, just like the Palazzo, you have to show a room key in order to go up to the rooms, which is both a good and bad thing. . . We stayed in the Deluxe Suite and I really loved how each suite is like a condo. Either 1 or 1&1/2 bathrooms, depending on which suite you choose, kitchenette, a huge fridge, pull out bed, etc. My favorite part of the room was that the hotel includes a Keurig machine in each room. I guess it doesn't really matter in Vegas but I thought it was really nice to have. They had a dining table, huge master bathroom, and the bed in the master bedroom was beyond comfortable. Once our stay was almost over, I realized that there isn't really much need for a huge fridge, stove, microwave, and dining table since we barely spent any time in the room anyways. The hotel is really nice and maybe more suitable if you're staying longer than just the weekend or if you're here with your family. On the brightside, Vdara is located quite conveniently from the strip. Walking distance to Planet Hollywood and everything else. I thought the location was one of the best parts of staying there.. . The only downside of my stay was when I  seperated from my group after a night out clubbing. I was the only one from my room to come back and the rest headed up to their own room. My boyfriend held my ID, money, and room key, but wasn't back yet so I went up to receptionist to try to get let in. Surprisingly, I wasn't the only one with that problem. The girl in front of me was giving the poor receptionist a lot of attitude but you can't blame the hotel for taking every precaution, especially when you have no identification on you and your name isn't on the reservation. Luckily, my name was on the reservation, I showed her my Facebook, and even at 4AM I had a lot of patience, which isn't hard to have since she was doing everything in her power to help me out. My friends ended up letting me back in and everything worked out in the end, but I still give the receptionist a lot of respect.. . Overall, had a really good stay and will probably come back to stay here again.
What an awesome hotel!  We were bummed at first because it had no casino, but that is actually a good thing! The casinos in the hotels were very smoky, crowded and loud.  We stayed in the Vdara Suite. My husband and I had the bed and my cousin had the sofa bed. The bed was extremely comfortable, but the sofa bed was not comfortable at all. You could feel the springs even under the bedding they provided. My cousin just slept on the couch which was more comfortable. We did not have a great view. Our view was the swimming pool which was closed for renovations. . . Besides the sofa bed and the pool, the other cons were the service for the bedding was really slow and so was the valet service. We tried to call for our car to be brought out earlier, but they don't provide that service. We waited at least 5 minutes for the car. There is also no self-parking lot. We had to call twice for the bedding. The front desk was not the friendliest. They were fake friendly and not personable at all.  . . Overall, I thought the hotel was great. The checked for key cards before letting anyone up. The staff, except for the front desk were pretty friendly. Slow, but friendly. I definitely would stay here again!
Checked in and we were given a nice room (Vdara Suite) with a boring view (freeway) but the employee (Megan) that helped us check in told me if the view was not to my liking I could request a room with a better view.  I called Megan and was told it would be 2-3 hours for the other room to be ready, nonetheless I appreciated being accommodated.  After 2 hours I had to call the front desk (was told I would be notified) to check the status of my new room and it was ready.  Once the switch was made we were not disappointed with the room or view.  But I was disappointed with housekeeping since they did not clean the room properly.  Also the bathroom door was difficult to lock and unlock.  The room did include a washer and dryer which was convenient but for some reason the dryer would only dry for a few minutes then stop and I had already adjusted the timer.  . Staff was courteous, hotel was quiet and within walking distant.  Take advantage of the walkway to Bellagio and the tram located right before entering the Bellagio hotel.  All in all I would stay at the Vdara again.
I thought the Vdara was supposed to be on of the newer hotels? I booked the panoramic suite here for my birthday and this stay was by the WORST experience ever. Almost nothing worked in our suite and I assumed they service we received was so awful because we were young adults just looking for a good time. The TV in the main bedroom didnt work & neither did the Phone. We told guest services twice & not only did they not fix it, but didn't even bother to give us a new room! . . On top of our 3 day stay, i kid you not - every time we would try to enter our room, the key cards NEVER worked. So we had to call guest services once again and wait 30 minutes for someone to open our door for us. Then we would have to go back down to check in and get a new set of keys. THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY for 3 DAYS. they tried to tell us "oh you must be putting it by your cell phone or credit card in your purse" WELL NO THAT WASNT THE PROBLEM. because after the 1st time it happened, we all put them in our shorts with nothing else so we wouldn't have to have the problem again. Really one of my hugest pet peeves are people treating you like your idiots. and what is the probably the BOTH cards wouldn't work?. . But that wasn't even the worst part. My first night stay and i woke up with BED BUG BITES all up and down my legs! (PICTURE UPLOADED) How wonderful my 21st birthday and i cant even go to thebeach club in my bathing suit. I was SO UPSET. I wrote an email, called. everything. Not one apology, reimbursement let alone a lousy response from Vdara!. . I will NEVER stay here again. All the money i spent for a suite and i would have rather stayed at circus circus at that point. As long as everything functioned & id be comfortable sleeping in a clean bed. This place is a nightmare.
