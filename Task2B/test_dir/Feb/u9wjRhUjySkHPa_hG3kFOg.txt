One of the best places to stay in Vegas. Always have a good time here and the rooms kick ass. Big and spacious and the best part? It's only a hop, skip and jump away from one of the top 3 clubs in Vegas, XS.. . This place has a lot of pluses: It's clean, smells nice, they don't care that every time you go there, you ask for a new Red Card and they even check up on you if you're slipping in and out of consciousness out at the video roulette machine at 6am in the morning. "No, sir. I'm not nodding off. I'm just in deep thought about my next move.". . The only negative I can think of is it's gotten progressively harder to get comps at this place.
Hate to date myself, but as a kid I was in Las Vegas in the days of the wise guys.  When the Wynn was the Desert Inn, and the Rat Pack was playing the Sands.  No high-rises.  People dressed for dinner and looked sharp for the casinos; the lounge acts were cool, no lines, no all-you-can eat buffets, no huge, fat people or oxygen breathers on their chair scooters.  No bling!  Just elegance.. . The Wynn epitomizes today's Vegas.  What you see on The Strip is what you used to see downtown.  ANYBODY can get in, and they do.  The public areas are tacky and loud, ditto for the rooms, though they are well-appointed and spacious.  This is franchise luxury. (The Sinatra Restaurant at the adjoining Encore has Chicken Saltimbocca -- chicken???  Old Blue Eyes is spinning in his grave.). . As a Vegas hotel these days, the Wynn is one of the best.  If you can get a good deal, then definitely go.  Frankly, I prefer the Red Rock.  Though way off The Strip, it's kinda like the old Vegas -- a place in the desert where you can gamble.
This is a magnificent hotel to stay in Vegas. Wynn is decorated to perfection with a sense of modernism. Everything is high end. The rooms are spacious andspecial and the Wynn Buffet is one of the best 3 in the city.. . Playing here might be tough on weeknights as the minimums on the table games go up. to 25-50 on some tables.
Stunning hotel and resort. We enjoyed the Sunday brunch buffet and were sat in the garden. The variety and quality of food was awe inspiring. In particular I enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza, coffee, fresh oj,dessert offerings, and gelato the most.
Frankly, I don't get it.  One of the newest, so-called flagship casino on the strip and I don't get excited coming here.  So many other casinos just blow away this one, like Aria, Bellagio, Venetian, etc.  It's nice and clean, but sterile.  Doesn't seem to have a personality.  The shops are high end, but small and cannot match the Miracle Mile, Caesar Forum or  the Grand Canal Shoppes.  Dealers are no fun and have that Atlantic City attitude.  So, I guess, I don't get it.
I thought I should update my review because the check in process did not go as smoothly as usual. There were long lines to check in, and once I made it there I felt customer service was lacking a little. Every time I tried to address issues I got a schpeil, so it was much like talking to a robot that didnt really have any answers but was giving the default excuse. Also...my tv wasnt working and the manager wasnt going to do anything about it. Their customer service was really lacking this time! Also, I would agree their dining collection needs a revamp. To top it all off...on my last night there they had the place so packed full of convention people that we had to wait it line for 20 minutes to get up to our room. Next time I will stay somewhere else...dont waste your vacation here!
We were treated like gold! Stay in the tower suites! It came with complimentary breakfast at Tableau--so worth it! I can't get over what an amazing experience we had at the Wynn. They are very hospitable and make sure all your needs are met.
This hotel makes people knees buckle from how luxurious it is.  It has both the Wynn and the Encore connected.  Check in might be a slow process but for good reason, the service personnel that works at check in really takes customer satisfaction very seriously.  It might seem like you're waiting forever at times but they really take their time to tend to whatever needs you have so be patient and it will be worth it once you're up at the counter.  Right outside the check in it has a very nice decorated garden to walk around and take pictures with along with a directory of the locations inside the hotel.  Going to your room you must have your room key present to present to the guard to gain access to the elevator.  The room key was very flashy too, they slide it into the machine to imprint your name onto it.  Everything within the room was pretty much activated through the electronic screen on the wall.  Depending on what floor you have and how you're orientated you might have an amazing view to the rest ofLas Vegas which can make a pleasant view for your sleep.  Everybody was very professional, and the rooms were super clean.  You might be paying a tad bit more compared to other hotels within the Strip, but it was totally worth it in my opinion.  I can't wait to come back for my Las Vegas adventures!
Mm I have to say I really liked Wynn. Although the space was a little smaller, in general, everything was pretty well maintained. Room service was also impeccable, this lady even organized our shoes! The location was a little annoying because it is kinda close to the end of the strip so it may take a while to walk to somewhere down the strip.
Awesome hotel!! Stayed here for 3 nights this last weekend.  The registration staff, security, even the gaming staff were all very nice and professional.  I especially liked the rooms, they were very stylish/modern and everything electric (light settings/curtains).  Plus the parking garage was VERY spacious and lots of available spaces to park my rental car.  Also, didn't hurt that I made some money playing at Wynn.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!
Such a supreme luxury it was to have just enjoyed a three day conference in arguably the nicest hotel I can remember in quite some time, if not ever. Every detail seems to have been attended to with elegance and quality, the staff as well was nothing but extraordinarily professional and helpful, and my hotel room was the epitome of luxury and comfort.. . I feel very lucky having been invited to the luxury real estate conference this year at the Wynn hotel not just because of the business contacts made but just as importantly I now know the hotel I will always opt to stay in for future Las Vegas adventures.
My wife and I had a great stay at the Wynn. It is truly a luxury resort. We will go back again next year.
Not nearly as smokey as many other casinos, and all the restaurants have vegan and vegetarian options, which is rare on the strip.  Overall, great decor inside.  We didn't stay here, so can't give room feedback.
My family has been coming to the Wynn for years as well as the Encore when it opened. There's hardly any reason at all to leave the casino: shows, great day/night club, restaurant, shopping, golf, pools, spa, etc. Also the tables don't pull any tricks on you like other casinos might do (face up cards in blackjack, card shufflers, single decks, heavy roulette ball). . . It's far from the bustle on the strip and is a bit "classier".. whatever that means. . . The reason why Im giving the review only 4 stars is because the food, just wasn't deserving of a 5 diamond award like it has been in the past. The fine dining is great dependingon what you get (Andreas, Mizumi and Botero, loved) but they are seriously cutting down quality in their casual dining. The portions at the cafe are smaller and not appetizing, the sandwiches at zoos aren't good anymore, the only restaurant that is open 24 hours is called Allegro and is Not Good. There was also ash in my hotel room's desk. . . I do still appreciate the hotel for their great service, impeccable attention to detail, beautiful decor and atmosphere, it is definitely one of the nicest hotels (if not the nicest) on the strip. Actually just looked it up and looks like they lost their 5 diamond award this year... I would still highly recommend I just wouldn't bother too much with casual dining if you are paying top dollar for it (no comps).
