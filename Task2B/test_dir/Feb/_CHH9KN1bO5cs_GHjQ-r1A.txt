Ok food is no question 5 stars- everything we ate was absolutely delicious! I would give 3.5 if possible for overall. My bf and I shared the chocolate fondue for two which is a great way to try many of the specialties on the menu. We also shared a hazelnut milkshake which was probably the best milkshake I ever had- perfect consistency and so chocolately! Our friend had a tiramisu which he really enjoyed as well. . . Problem was the service was just terrible. First there was a girl who was training but really was receiving no guidance and didn't know what she was doing. Then our waitress,  who seemed nice at first, left us for so long when we were waiting to order. We had to ask another waiter to get her and even finding someone else took a while. . . Our food took a while to come too which would have been fine if a) it come out all at once and b) it came out correctly! Noting that this was 11pm and so maybe service is better in the day but still! She brought out half of our fondue, and then served someone else before bringing the rest! Then we realized she had brought milk not dark chocolate so had to wait again for her to correct it. . . Other than the service again the food was unreal and I will be having sweet chocolate dreams because of it!
Chocolate heaven! If i were to die then I want to come here afterwards! I got the french toast... mind you im more of a pancakes or waffles guy... but it just sounded too good to pass up. The chocolate sauce they gave you to top it was delicious and it was cooked to perfection so that it was crispy on the surface but squishy in the middle. Highly recommended!
This place is always good, it was good today like usual. I did get really annoyed with the waitress . She told us the place was closing and she needs a job. she asked my Boyfriend for his name and phone number to call to ask about his job to get in. This wouldn't of annoyed me but she didn't ask me she only asked him about work. I work too. Another thing too I payed the bill she still handed the bill to him said her name was in there and for us to do a review. I won't mention her name just in case. She was nice I just think she was innapropriate. No matter whats  going on I didn't think it's right asking a man for his number when he is on a date right in front of the girl. Especially when you are working. Best chocolate shakes in town.
Great place for dessert! We had the banana split waffle an melting chocolate truffle heart cake! So yummy!. We went back there a second time!. Loved every bite!
We were really disappointed in our experience here.  We ate there at 11pm on Valentines Day night.  My boyfriend mmade the reservation a month in advance and even called to push out the time the same night because his flight in was delayed.  When we got there they said they did not have a reservation for us.  When they sat us we asked to be moved to a bigger empty table and were told it was "reserved". At least someone's reservation was recorded. So we sat at a tiny table and proceeded to be waited on  by the most disinterested and rude waitress.  Don't remember her name but she had a 16 tattoo.  She was not in the mood for any questions on the dessert and could not be bothered to give us some direction on the fondue.  She should have explained all the items included along with the best way to enjoy the dessert.  It's Valentines Day!  This is supposed to be an experience. We ordered two desserts including the fondue and it barely fit on the tiny table and we were constantly worried we would catch on fire from the flame on the fondue tray.  Oh and that bigger table we had requested that was "reserved" sat empty the whole time.  Not the place to go for a special evening or really ever.  We'll stick with Raku Sweets.
Food is okay.  Service is terrible.  Server made us feel uncomfortable and girl handing out "free samples" was incredibly rude.  Found out they are closing in a few months, which explains complete ambivalence of the staff there.  Stay away.
If I'm only reviewing the food I would give it about 4 stars but the service was horrid. I ordered the veggie conscious burger and it was delicious, lots of avocado. It came with waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder on them and a side of aioli, delish. Their BLT and spicy chicken pizza is also incredible and worth trying. But back to the reason I'm giving the place 2 stars, the service. My server went way beyond trying to just be friendly and made myself, and my family, completely uncomfortable. He told us that no one likes him and even shared that the restaurant is closing soon (who tells their customers that?!). I think after awhile he realized that he was making us tense and left us alone. After our meal, we decided to check out the small chocolate shop section within the restaurant. The girl giving out free samples of chocolate was incredibly rude. SHE asked ME if I'd like a sample and as I was about to try it she yelled out to me "You're welcome!" Implying that I was rude for not saying thank you. It actually shocked me a bit so I apologized and said thank you. Two seconds after, she did the same thing to someone else. I quickly walked out of there without expecting to ever go back. It's upsetting when you find a restaurant where you actually enjoy the food but their service makes you hesitant to go back. Oh well, they're closing anyways.
Very very good desert place... Didn't have dinner but it looked good. Next time we come to LV we will try dinner than have desert right after ;-) must try place!!
From 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:. . Food - 5. Service - 5. Price - 4. . The food is awesome here and the desserts are even better.  For breakfast/lunch get the sunrise burrito.  It is outstanding!  For appetizers the hummus and chickensates are good.  For dinner, the macaroni (add chicken to it) is awesome!
Did I not tell you I'm the biggest chocolate addict??! Wow, I finally had the chance to check this place out.  My friends from Australia were the ones that knew about this restaurant and talked so highly about it and and took me there when they came into town.  . . First moment of walking in, my eyes were so overwhelmed with all the awesome decor!  You just get this relaxed sense of feeling ... Could it be all the cocoa powder on the air I'm inhaling ?? Haha . . What can I say - everything on the menu looked so amazing.  So hard to choose just one :/  So I wanted to try something basic- that way I get a taste of their chocolate, batter, and fruit.  So ordered the waffles with strawberry and side of chocolates.  The chocolate I can't even give an adjective that would even describe the way the chocolate tasted.... I thought European chocolate candy bars were amazing - but wow! This is like the premium of all chocolate! I will never eat chocolate the same ever again... I'm jaded! Lol . . One thing that my friends told me is how the Max Brenner in Australia doesn't serve entrees - their emphasis is mainly on desserts.  Honestly I would prefer the same if I knew otherwise.
Delicious dessert last night! We sat at the bar, which was perfect, and drank choc-tails and ate the famous heart-shaped chocolate molten cake trio. . . Doesn't get much better than chocolate overload!
Came to this place for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. We came with full expectation to try as many things as humanly possible. I had the Brenner burger (it was average) and my husband had the Cubano waffle sandwich (he reported it was tasty). The fries were uber tasty. We then got the classic European fondue for two and an Italian hot chocolate. I just loved the hot chocolate - it was so rich and creamy. I'm drooling right now. My husband liked the fondue more so. It came with two choices of chocolate (we did dark and milk) and caramel sauce. Dipping items included a chocolate chip cookie, brownies, bananas, strawberries and marshmallows (along with a little burner to toast them on!). The milk chocolate was way too sweet for me, but I think it helped me self diagnose a possible cavity (ouch!). The dark chocolate was really tasty and overall our favorite fondue sauce. . . Service was pretty good - there was a moment or two we wondered where our server was but overall he kept up with refills and bringing things out quickly. . . This is one of those places to come in LV if you are looking for a unique yet casual dining experience. We will make this one of our go-to spots to stop in for a quick bite!
I'm sure at one point in time Max Brenner was on point for food and service, but with the recent news that this location is closing on April 13th, I feel like this may have deflated some of the employees, and it is reflected in their service. . . We were seated as soon as we got to the restaurant, and our server was very warm.  My girlfriends and I started with two white chocolate chai, one being with soy milk.  When our server brought the drinks out, I asked which one was with soy milk, and received a "I think it's this one?" in return.  Strike one.. . We hone in on what we want to order.  I ordered a Lazy Breakfast with sausage, cheddar cheese, and onions, and the girls ordered their plates.  We waited for about 20 minutes, and our server returns with plates in hand.  I take a peek at the meal, and notice it's bacon with no onions.  My girlfriend's order was also incorrect.  Strike two.  We informed our server, and he immediately took the plates back, and had the manager come by to let us know that it wasn't our server's fault, however the fault of one of the chef's in the back.  He apologized and let us know that we would be receiving our meals in a few moments.. . We waited for another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  At this point, our third friend was nearing the end of her meal, and we were just beginning.  Whatever, no big deal.  We're making the best of it at this point.  We stop our server and ask for ketchup and extra napkins.  He gives us a thumbs up and replied that he would be back in a few moments.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we flagged another server down.  Strike three.  **You're Out!**. . The food was mediocre at best.  It was a simple egg scramble with sausage, cheese, and onions with a side of country potatoes.  The only part of the meal that was unique was the sugar biscuit with the side of chocolate fondue.  It was pretty decadent for breakfast, but still delicious.. . As we were nearing the end of our meal, we ordered two mochas to-go (one with soy milk, once again), and asked for the check.  After another 10 minutes of chatting and waiting, our drinks come out with the bill.  I ask our server which of the two drinks was the one with soy, and once again I'm faced with a blank stare.  Strike one.  I give him my card to pay for our meals, and he returns after a few moments with the receipt.  I take a look and notice that he's overcharged us on our bill.  Strike two (but I suppose I should have looked at this prior to giving him my card.  I'll call this strike one and a half.)  We point out the mistake, and he promises to alleviate the situation.  He takes the receipt and leaves our table for another 20 minutes to speak with the manager to fix the amount.  Strike three for the amount of time we've been sitting at the restaurant with the intention of a quick breakfast prior to leaving Vegas.  **You're Out!**. . Our server arrives back and theatrically rips up the receipt stating that it wouldn't be charged on my card, and that the transaction was voided completely.  He notifies me that he would return with the proper receipt with the updated amount.  While he's away, I check my Chase app to find that my card had indeed been charged and placed on a hold.  Strike one.  I understand there are certain policies in place, but it would've been much more appreciated if he had correctly informed me realistically of what was going to happen: you're going to be charged, we'll refund that amount after a few days, and you'll be charged again for the proper amount.  After his return to the table, I showed him that it had been taken out of my account.  I'm once again faced with the blank stare that I've grown accustomed to during this visit.  Since for some reason I wasn't able to obtain a receipt of the voided transaction, I asked for something in writing stating that the amount would be refunded.  He leaves for another 15 minutes to acquiesce my request.  Strike two because we've been sitting here frustrated for close to two hours.. . I end up paying once again and speak with the manager who has already come by our table for the food mixup.  I ask if there's any way I would be able to retrieve a copy of the original receipt, and he declines.  I ask about the timeframe on the refund, and he states that it should be applied by the evening.  He became defensive stating that this "happens all the time" and it's "totally normal".  He then goes ahead to blame my bank for the pending charge and takes no responsibility.  Strike three, **You're Out!**.. . This appears to be a shut out, ladies and gentlemen.  Max Brenner, you are bad and you should feel bad.
Amazing chocolate heaven. All the pictures speak for themselves.. The hot chocolate was really thick. The strawberry and chocolate waffles were amazingly good. I wish I could have tried more.. . This place would be a hit in my hometown of MIAMI; vegas options are so many that it can get overlooked.
I don't know about coming here for anything other than dessert or a sweet breakfast. I've tried their desserts and I've tried their savory foods... I choose desserts and will only choose desserts from here on out. I had their waffle sandwich and it was gross! I was so annoyed cause the waitress was raving about how popular and delicious it was... I was so ready to write that bad review on yelp until I had their dessert. Oh my goodness was their dessert amazing and just heavenly! We got the molten cake trio and it was amazing!
Very nice waitress but it was so understaffed and we had to wait an hour for a salad. Pretty ridiculous and annoying
Very enjoyable. The environment is great. The food was okay, but wow was the dessert worth it! . . Update: On mysecond visit to Max's, something unpleasant occurred. My friends and I made a reservation for an event but when we arrived, the hostess told us our table was taken because someone persuaded the manager. We tried to argue with the manager but she kept saying "We can't hold tables." Which makes NO sense. That second visit was a mood killer, probably won't be coming back for a long time.
Food was great. I had the mac and cheese and some appetizers. I have been here twice, which should say something because I HATE driving to the strip being a local. Very cool environment with many food options, A fun selection of drinks for kids and adults, and desserts to die for!  My server was Dominique (blonde haired young girl). It's sometimes a challenge to find servers who are not only knowledgeable of the menu but also very attentive, helpful,  and nice. Thanks again!
A salty appetizer and deliciously decadent dessert in cute seats under pipes that seem like chocolate could be flowing through them.  My husband and I had lots of fun making up for all of our Vegas walking with this indulgence!. . We started with lovely salty-to-upcoming-sweets waffle fries dusted with chili and cocoa powder - a little crispy and yum!  . . I got the O.M.G Chocolate Chunk Cookies, which were dry and just OK (if you really must order these, get a side of ice cream), but my husband got the Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae, which was incredible!  It was definitely enough to share and came in this endless Serendipity-like bowl/glass where every spoonfull was a little different and absoloutely heavenly.  Both came with a shot of chocolate on the side...mmmmmm..
