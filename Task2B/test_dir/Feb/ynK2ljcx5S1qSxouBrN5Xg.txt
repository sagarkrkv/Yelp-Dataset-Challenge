-Whoever designed this place did a heck of an odd ball job. The room starts off like a normal room where you walk into a hallway with a closet, then it seems like the designer put the restroom in the middle of the room on accident and hid it behind walls so, you half to walk around the restroom to get to the bed putting it at an awkward angle to the tv and dresser. . . -The pool is on a random floor at the end of the longest hallway. . . -The gym is also on the floor as their retail floor so you workout while others pass by to shop or eat. . . -The view...well, I have their A/C units and ducts so that's interesting.... . -Overall, this place is just laid out weird, the resort itself offers some nice benefits to their hotel guests. Free access to the observation decks being one. A view to die for (especially at night).
Love this hotel! I usually stay here when I come to Vegas, and I have never need disappointed! The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating, the view is incredible, and it is situated right between the strip and Fremont street. Would probably advise against eating here, but only because Las Vegas has better options than their buffet. Rooms are comfortable, but not fancy. I will definitely be coming back!
This review is for only the bar and the Casino..  I did not stay here!. . Bar-. The bar is right when you walk in the door.  Every night from 6pm to 10 pm you get all you can drink for $19.99.  This might be the best deal in Vegas if you are looking to tie one on.   If you order doubles the drinks are really strong, to the point you can see the layer of booze and the layer of mixer and see through the mixer.  I am not complaining one bit.. just warning you all.   There is only one waitress in there, but she did a pretty good job of keeping up.  I did walk up to the bar once and got a refill.  . . The casino. . The casino is alright.  Nothing specail.  I basically is the same as ever other big casino on the strip.   It is kind of dark in there though.  . . Bar gets 5/5 Stars. . Casino 3/5
My wife and I stayed here for a conference held at LVCC. We had not stayed here before but thought we would give it a shot and check out the view we had heard so much about. We were not disappointed. It is breathtaking and everyone that visits Vegas needs to check this out.. The hotel is very nice with friendly staff. The rooms were large with large TVs. We were on the 16th floor and we had an amazing view of the tower which had people bungee jumping off of it night and day. This was fun to watch. The hotel also has great happy hours at a couple of the restaurants which we took advantage of.. Great hotel and we will definitely be back.
Its been a while since I stayed at this casino, probably way back when Stardust was still around. Back then, Stratosphere was bustling with people and the environment was really lively. This place seems deserted now in comparison to when it first opened. We picked up a drink at the bar in the center of the casino and there were only two other patrons at the bar. The gaming floor was darn near empty.. . We took our drinks and walked up to the second floor where the shopping area is and the only place that had a few people was McDonalds. The rest of the shops were empty to the point where several of the shop owners were just standing by their store entrances, looking really bored. . . This place has lost its grandeur and I find it bizarre that this place hasn't gone out of business from its lack of guests. I've seen casinos in Downtown Vegas that had more guests roaming about.
Horrible staff!!!! Bartender constantly asking me if I'm playing (for comp drinks). my husband being accused of picking up someone else's money by the pitboss. Worst casino experience in Vegas!!!!
Stayed here for the weekend on a Staycation with my husband. Great rooms. Lots of resturaunts to choose from with great variety. All the resturaunts give u A LOT of food. Great price plus gift shops and free tower admission. Would definetly recommend and be staying again.
My best friend came from Florida to visit me in summer of 2012. We planned on going to Vegas and we choose the Stratosphere. What a mistake we made, the shower got clog and when we call maintenance they didn't came to check the shower until 2 hours later and when they did it got clog again. When we returned to our room from the pool the bedroom was not clean, so we call the cleaning people and again 30 min later they showed up. I will never stay at this place again. I'm placing this review now because back then I didn't join Yelp.
I was heading to vegas with a few friends and they werent happy with the fact that i booked Stratosphere due to thebad experience they had from 2 years ago that they stayed there. It was already too late since i already booked the hotel so we just went with the flow. I must tell you when we arrived there the hotel looked very nice and clean. My friends main issue was the room so we were worried about the rooms and carpet being dirty but I guess they renovated all the rooms and the rooms were super clean with new furniture and all the good stuff. We loved it. Also booking through groupon I got 4 passes to go upto the Tower which is really nice. Once you head up there you can see the whole vegas. They had a female Dj and she was playing cool hip songs. Over all ill say it is a nice place to stay. You can just stay in the hotel and do so much. . . Cons: A little bit away from the strip. . . Buffet was closed which we really wanted to try. I heard if you pay for lunch buffet you can also go and eat dinner for free.. Now thats a deal. Sad that it was close when we stayed there.
I stayed at the Stratosphere during a business trip.. . The hotel is conveniently located right in between the strip and downtown, so you don't get the traffic and madness of either one. The neighborhood and hotel itself are kind of sketchy. I didn't feel unsafe or anything, but I wouldn't walk around at night either.. . I stayed at the "renovated rooms" which are much nicer than the regular ones. They are at least updated.. . The size of the room was fine, the beds are comfortable but I have a huge issue with housekeeping. I stayed there for 10 nights and even though they came and made my bed and replenish toiletries everyday, they NEVER, not EVEN ONCE changed my sheets or scrubbed the tub, they didn't sweep or mop the tile or anything. . . If I have a choice in the matter I would much rather stayed somewhere else. . I also ate at all the restaurants in there and all of them are from mediocre to nasty. . . They say that you get what you pay for, this is totally true at this hotel.. If you are on a budget, I recommend the Golden Nugget (downtown)
Ghetto?? Need I say more.. So when we first got checked in, we went to our room...We laid on the bed to relax after being on the road...after about 30 minutes of relaxing, we hear a knock at the door..but before my husband could open the door, a Mexican lady BUSTS into our room !! She started waving her hands around in the air and was speaking Spanish to us. We were in utter disbelief! So..if that wasn't bad enough, she picks up our phone, makes a phone call (to who, I don't know), she is speaking Spanish to whoever it is she is speaking to on the phone..She got off of the phone, said something to us in Spanish and LEFT! Me and my husband were really STUNNED.. So, once we got our bearings together, we called the front desk to complain. The girl that I spoke to apologized and said that she'd talk to the maid that came in our room. Ok..so the room...it was minimally clean..the porcelain in the tub was not sparkling..the decor was meh.. the room smelled musty. The price of the room was high IMO compared to other hotels in the area considering the quality of the room. So, to make matters worse..their were teenagers running up and down the halls ALL NIGHT..So, I finally call security (which I've never done in my life while staying at a hotel, I can bare some noise, after all it's Vegas, but this was ridamndiculous) they FINALLY responded to my call and when they did, they knocked on their door. (I can hear them) and they said "The folks next to you called and complained and said you were too loud. Please keep it quiet",  so all I could think is GREAT.. This dummy has now toldthese people who outed them! I would have preferred to be anonymous, especially me knowing nothing about who I am next to.  It truly could have been anyone that complained because they were just that loud...So  I asked if I could switch rooms after this, they told me that I couldn't.. I was like.."WONDERFUL" .  So we bared with it.. We had also asked for an extra blanket for our bed at one point...I kid you not, it took about 2hrs for them to bring it.. They woke us out of our sleep by the time they finally brought  it up... Also, the area surrounding the casino is SUPER shady..make sure you carry your switchblade with you if you plan to walk the streets in that area!!! The casino floor is nice here and the Level 7 club is classy, the breakfast buffet was decent. (We got free passes)  But I definitely wouldn't stay here again. I've stayed at less pricey places and had a much better experience. I'd go to one of the hotels downtown before I'd stay here again!
After our flight was cancelled we needed a hotel for the night so we booked a room at the Stratosphere on Expedia. The price was great but the cab ride from the airport was pretty much the same price as the room which was absurd. We opted for the bus on the way back.. . After a long day of travelling and spending hours in an airport the jetted tub was wonderful. The room itself was clean and really nice. All we really did was sleep, spending less than 10 hours in the hotel but the sleep was much needed and the bed was comfortable. . . The check out feature from our room on the tv made for a seamless check out.
Didn't stay as a guest, but did visit for the evening to check out the Pin Up show- which I was nearly late for due to the clusterduck that is their parking system. Someone needs to get on fixing that up, stat.. . Drove up, pulled in where it said to drive through for self-parking only to sit in a line of taxis. No employees directing traffic. Finally found the Self-Park signage/arrows, only to be unable to get to that area. After looping around twice, I follow the arrow only to enter an exit into the parking garage. Luckily I immediately ran into an employee who told me how to get around and to the third floor.. . Only to follow the directions and head straight into oncoming traffic, since I was still going the wrong way. Essentially, the guy directed me to the exit. Looped around a third time, and all the openings to the garage that I could find whiel following the signage and the printed arrows on the ground, directed me to DO NOT ENTER spaces.. . Finally I pulled a U-ie and went in the one actual entrance, and found a spot. Which was roughly 20 minutes later, and only after getting harassed by a loud screaming guy in a white Escalade who followed me with his high beams on yelling at me going the wrong way-- even though, as I said, I was following the signs and the white arrows on the ground, and was even encountering stop signs, but couldn't ever find an entrance to the garage.
I went to visit my girlfriend while she was staying there for the Magic trade show.  The room seemed okay, nothing to nice.  But the carpets did seem dirty. And not to mention I had gotten bit from something while sleeping there.  My  girlfriend the next day even had to go to the ER with a bug bite that got infected.  The staff was pretty rude to her.  We will never go there again.  And we recommend that peopleuse precaution if they do stay there.  You might end up with bug bites, and might have to get on antibiotics like my girlfriend did.
BEWARE OF "MANAGERS SPECIAL!!!!"  If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made my reservation online with travelocity for about fifty bucks, I was stoked because it was so cheap! When I checked in I was told of a managers special for 67 dollars more with a jacuzzi in the room! Score right? Nope, when I received my statement I was charged 93 dollars. A little off from the 67 I was promised. Then when I called and talked to three different people they pretty much told me I was an idiot and wouldn't refund me the difference. So much for customer service.
Had a horrible experience at their casino. Had my purse stolen with all my belongings the first night I arrived. Their security did not show any kind of effort to look for it. I told them I wanted their cameras checked and after 3 long hours of waiting for an answer I was told that the cameras did not show anything..... The angle I was sitting was not captured by the camera. That is a ridiculous answer. Every Casino has cameras facing every angle. Every person I seemed to talk to just gave me the run around and after arriving home I called and over the phone I still had to deal with unprofessional customer service. . I talked to several other casinos around the area and was told that the excuse I was given about the cameras was just to keep me away!. Will never go back to this place.
really enjoyed my stay here....the view from the top is amazing...really looking forward to staying here again
