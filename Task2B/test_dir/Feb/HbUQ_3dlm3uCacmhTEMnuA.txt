We had the worst meal here two weeks in a row. I mean if we're spending $1200 bucks for 5 people it better be pretty good. I've eaten here a total of 3 times. First being a great experience. Food was epic and service was on point. The last two times have really changed not only where we eat from here on out in Las Vegas, but also has really burnt me and our friends on steakhouses. I'll never eat here again and I hope you have a better experience. If you don't please share about it. Chef Needs to step up food and service.
This place wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. And if I am spending that kind of money, I expect great. The waitress was nice, but very un-attentive. I had to waive a different server down to get my bill. The filet was prepared in a way I wasn't super stoked on, but it tasted good. The sweet potato side was horrible. The potatoes were hard as a rock. To top it off, one of the hostesses said (in a rude manner) I couldn't get in that night and as I was about to walk away, another hostesses who watched our conversation grabbed me and said they had a table. So that was nice, but I should have just gone in.. . Overall, very very average, but for that kind of money, not some where I would go again.
It's a tradition that for my birthday, my husband takes me to a restaurant that's a surprise, and somewhere we've never been before. When he revealed that was taking me to Craftsteak, he prefaced it with a lengthy justification, mainly centered on the fact that, yes, Craftsteak is a steakhouse, but they have an impressive assortment of vegetable options. I was not disappointed.. . The menu changes daily, apparently, and does have lots of veggie options (though most of them are garnished with some manner of pork products, so if you're strictly vegetarian, this is not your place). . . When we sat down, we were brought a cast-iron pan of the most delicious dinner rolls--fluffy, light, and yeasty, but impossibly buttery, with a sprinkle of salt on top. I felt a little ridiculous putting butter on mine, but I did it anyway.. yeasty, buttery rolls with a sprinkle of salt on top. . We ordered the Billionaire Cocktail (Booker's Bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, dash of grenadine, star anise) and the Cucumber Gin Martini (Hendricks Gin, cucumber, fresh lime sour). Both were delicious...sweeter than I normally go for, but not unbalanced. They bring the martini glass with the garnish to the table, and then an individual shaker with the cocktail separately. The shakers has roughly 1.3 martinis.. . The Bibb salad was a generous portion, beautiful, smoky, crisp, with pickled onion, chives, blue cheese, and lardons. It was perfet to share.. . We were thiknking of skipping entrees altogether and just loading up on all the tempting sides, but my husband insisted it was too ridiculous, so we got the European Sea Bass (beurre blanc, chives, a pile of sauteed Napa cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, and a piece of crispy pancetta on top). The fish was well cooked and flaky, and the sauce complemented it without overpowering.. . I was particularly excited about the mushrooms--you can order several different varieties, or get the Mushroom Assortment. We were planning to get the assortment, but there were too many other things we wanted to try. I'm glad we didn't...the Hen of the Woods was tasy, but not impressive. (NB, If you want amazing mushrooms, go to a Thomas Keller restaurant.). . Since it was my birthday, I ordered a few things that I normally would have compromised on, but it turned out that my husband enjoyed them--kale and Maui onions. The kale was cooked to the brink of death, and studded with cannelini beans and lardons. It was more of a Southern greens preparation, and it was delicious...smoky and bacon-y. . . The Maui onions were cut in half and roasted, with Minus 8 Vinegar (made from ice wine). They were perfectly tender and sweet. Delicious. . The butternut risotto was good but I expected it to be more flavorful, especially with the scallions and proscuitto. . . The service was really good all night until the very end, when we had to wait a little while to get our bill.. . Overall, it was a highly enjoyable meal, even sans steak.
3 guys, 1067$ bill.  This place is overkill and not in a good way.  8 dessert plates and each one had at least 1 scoop of ice cream. This place is insane.
For what you are paying you need to be wowed.  I was not wowed.  Now, I do get to eat out quite often and as such am picky, but if I am paying 56 for a steak (cheapest filet) and potentially even 115-260 for a steak it needs to be something I couldn't cook at home.  The steak prep was uninspiring, the sides were ho hum, I had the corn grits and they were just wrong.  I live in the south, eat grits all the time, for breakfast for dinner, creamy, cheesy or stone ground, etc... and these were just not worth the calories (though the bacon on top was good :)).  The Parker house yeast rolls served before were fine, I have had this twice now on the west coast (la the time before) and I think it is a "new" thing - supposed yeast Parker house rolls with salt on top, but they aren't the right style of roll - yeast rolls need to melt in your mouth, these do not, more boring basic white bread roll.  A southerner needs to teach both places how to make yeast rolls! The service is also one of those "sit and savor", it was late and my first night there, I didn't want to sit or savor :) the staff was friendly enough, but again I wasn't wowed for what was easily a $2000 bill for our group. So, if you don't get to go out to nice places often this is probably a great upscale very nice meal, but honestly the food does not warrant the prices they want you to pay.
I liked it here. I have tried a fairly decent portion of the Steak Houses in town and I decided to try this one during my last Stay-Cation on the strip. . . My boyfriend and I decided to do their tasting menu for two... It was WAY too much food, but everything was very good. We also chose to add the wine pairing, which was wonderful.. . I would completely give this place five stars... but our server did something that made us uneasy. We ordered the mid-level wine pairing, and he insisted on pouring us from the top-level wine pairing but didnt charge us additional $$. Every time no one was around, he would pour us EXTRA wine. I understand he was trying to go above and beyond, but I found this slightly tacky and a little offensive. It almost made me feel like he thought we could afford it or something...It was a little strange. Other than that, the food was amazing. . . The bread is awesome, but try not too fill up because their portions are very large.
My wife and I went a week earlier to celebrate Valentine's.  Based on the reviews, we decided to try Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak.. . We made our reservations at 6:30pm and were promptly seated.  First impression of the steakhouse environment, it is very intimate.  The colors, designs, and furniture were all very warm and inviting.  However, the dining table was rather interesting.  It is a large square slab -- too large to be honest.  My wife sat on one end and I sat on the other.  In order to communicate, we felt we had to "yell" out for the other to hear us.  After 5 minutes, we decided to sit "together" on one side.  Throughout dinner, since people had to speak up, we could hear the conversations on either side of our table.  This was not very intimate.. . Upon being seated, because we came early, it was not busy.  About 6 waiters converge on a central plate area chit chatting.  We waited for a good 20 minutes, no waiter, now water, no orders were taken.  Finally, we hailed a bus boy requesting our waiter.  He promptly came, named Blass, took our orders and left.  Throughout the dining experience, a group of bus boys and a different server brought our dinner.  Not once were we asked about our dining experience or whether we need additional water or menu items.  I had to hail our waiters a couple times to refill my water.  Unreal.  . . Even worst, both tables on either side of us had the same complaints.  I had no idea what our waiter was doing; but, he was definitely not doing his job.. . As for the food, we ordered the following:. . 1.  Appetizers .      -- Lobster Bisque -- this was recommended by a friend.  The texture and aroma  .          was perfect.  It had a lightness to it and flavor was good.  However, it needed.          major salt.      -- Scallops -- They were plump.  And, presentation was nice.  However, it lacked     .          flavor.  It was not juicy and tasted kinda dry.  This could have been done                     .          better.. . 2.  Entree #1.       -- Striped Bass -- this was the worst dish possible.  My wife was very upset.  The bass was NOT fresh.  For 30+ dollars, this dish was a waste.  The reason why we know that it was not fresh was that the fish was not flaky.  Instead, it was extremely sticky and tasted OLD.  This was inexcusable.  Of course, we tried to track our waiter down, but he never showed up.  .  . 3.  Entree #2.       -- Short Ribs.  This was Tom's signature dish.  It was very tender and very good.  Flavor could have been better with salt; but, overall, we were not disappointed. . 4.  Drinks -- We ordered a couple Raspberry Martini's -- these were excellent.. . Usually, I tip between 20-25%.  When I received the bill, I was tempted to put zero.  However, because the bus boys did a good job, I could not penalized them for the lack of service by the waiter.  Dinner for two was about $225 with tip.. . Here are my ratings:. . 1.  Environment - good ambiance, however, dining table was a major issue.  When having an intimate dinner, you do not need to be able to hear your neighbor's discussion -- 3 stars. . 2.  Waiter -- service was horrible --- Zero stars. . 3.  Hostess and Bus Staff - they saved the night for us.  They were polite and prompt - 5 stars. . 4.  Meal -- the meal was at best ~ average.  For a high dining restaurant, you expect better quality for the PRICE.  - 2 stars. . Overall, we would rate this as a low 2 stars.  Obviously, we were not pleased.  As a regular diner to many of Las Vegas's finest restaurants, we most likely would not return.  We do hope that their management fix the service issue.  We were sorely disappointed and would not recommend dining here.. . Thank you.
My third trip back to Craftsteak confirms this is my new favorite steakhouse in LV.  My previous fave was SW Steakhouse but this place has definitely grown on me.  The dry aged ribeye (med-rare) is consistently cooked to perfection (slightly bloody) and the flavor always gets high marks.  The only real questionhere  is what sides to get.   The sauteed mushroom variety is surprisingly good but the dinner rolls are enough to fill you up before the steak.  The service is pretty good and the attire is casual so you don't have to get really dressed up.  Reservations are a must.
What a fun experience! Considering the price, you get to eat in a lively environment (where it's obvious the patrons and waitstaff are enjoying their time) in a romantic and intimate setting. The decor is warm and inviting and seemed to be a great setting for groups too.. . My boyfriend and I got the tasting menu where you get appetizers, entree with sides, and then dessert. We also got the wine pairings, too. Well worth it! But prepare yourself - you will be stuffed. I'm so glad I wore a loose fitting blouse with a bodycon skirt.... . Appetizers - enjoyed the variety of the flavors; flavorful and fun. 1. Shrimp cocktai. 2. Prosciutto San Daniele with Yali Pears . 3. Caesar Salad - wasn't a huge fan of this dish...especially the pickled anchovies. 4. Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Hazelnuts. . Entree - Angus beef steaks were flavorful, juicy, and it was like eating beefy butter. 1. 2 steaks. 2. Potato Puree. 3. Asparagus. 4. Mushroom assortment (Hen of the Woods was my favorite!). . Dessert - so decadent and amazing. 1. Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Pecan Toffee Sauce . 2. Seasonal Ice Cream/Sorbet Sampler. 3. Seasonal Cheesecake, Seasonal Garnish. 4. Fruit medley
I just got home from a week in Vegas and went to nice dinners every night.  I was really looking forward to Craftsteak because of all the hype and the chef.  . . Was it good, yes.  Was it great, no.  For the money I paid I expect it to be great or beyond.   The ambiance and drinks were phenomenal, but the steak and sides were par.. . I ate at 'The Country Club' at Wynn and 'Prime'  at the Bellagio - both exceeded this place and were cheaper as well.
Oh. My. Goodness. Such awesome food. I can't remembert the name of the meal we ordered. You started off with (dinnerf or two) two salads, three starters (shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, and bruscetta). Then we each got to hoose our meats. One wagyu sirloin and one wagyu ribeye. These steaks were superbly cooked. Very flavorful and melted in your mouth. The steaks came wth three sides. Bacon and cheese grits (to die for!!), asparagus, and potato gratin. Basically, we were full half way throught he steaks. . . After all that, you also got three desserts. So being as full as we were, we took them to go. He Cinnamon Monkey bread was exellent. Paula Dean would've loved the butter flavor. It simply melted in your mouth. There was also a chocolate cake and a fruit tart. All were yummy. . . Was a great food experience. Dropped $500 for two people, but how often do you get to eat this quality of food? Definitely reccommend if you have the time and the money. Great experience.
My husband and I came here for Valentines day and just loved it. We had a wonderful server (I believe her name was Sheryl or Sheralyn) and she took excellent care of us. We did the Chef's Beef selection which allowed us to sample a lot of different things from the menu. We LOVED the rolls that came out prior to our meal -- they were crispy on the outside and so soft inside with a hint of salt on the outside. Our first course came out -- we sample the Prosciutto, the baby bibb (which was my fave), shrimp cocktail, and the persian cucumber salad. Our second course ( we were able to pick 2 meats) so we did the domestic wagyu ribeye and filet mignon. Our sides were potatoes gratin, risotto and carrots. The meats were cooked perfectly and tasted so sublime. Our favorite side was the potatoes gratin but the risotto and carrots were yummy as well. Finally, our final course was dessert!! We sampled the cinnamon monkey bread (my husbands favorite), two sorbets, a caramel cheesecake (my favorite), and fruit sampler. The Chef's Beef selection was great because we sampled a lot of what was on the menu however it was slightly more pricey than just ordering a few things that we were interested in. We came back to Craftsteak another night we were in LV (that's how much we loved it!) and we just ordered what we liked and it was about $50-70 cheaper. That night I had the wagyu skirt steak which was also super yummy but a little too buttery for my liking. My husband had the regular filet mignon (non-wagyu) and he could tell a big difference in the meats. The second time around we tried the chocolate souffle which was good but no where near as yummy as the cheesecake or monkey bread. . . Over all we had a great experience both times we were there - both with service and food. The ambiance is somewhere between casual and romantic. We saw some people in jeans but we opted to dress a little nicer both times. Needless to say we will definitely return to eat here the next time we are in LV.
My husband and I waited rather late and thought our Valentines would be spent at the Denny's on the strip but MGM managed to find a few dinner openings for us and we settled on a late seating (10:30 to be exact) at CraftSteak. I was a bit concerned with having a reservation for the last seating of the night but we were not disappointed. Since everything is made from scratch as ordered it is all fresh and everything on themenu is available. Our waiter was a Swedish gentleman by the name of Peter and he was a delight. There were three other young men that assisted him at his four tables. The menu was overviewed for us and our waiter asked if we were wine drinkers or other. We asked him about his food preferences and he said for him it depended on what we wished to drink. When we expressed that we enjoyed wine he further explained the menu with foods that would complement the reds we wished to taste. We went with the Wagyu beef tasting for two. Our waiter suggested each of the dishes he planned to bring out letting us know that we could stop him at anytime to make a change in anything we did not want. He was spot on with the entire meal. It was the most amazing dining experience we have ever had. There was an so much food though but what we did not eat was packaged up for us to take back to our room. We had quite an amazing snack at about 3 a.m. after a late evening of gaming. We can not say enough about the food, service, and ambiance of this restaurant. Beware those rolls though, they are delicious and filling. Our waiter warned us about them early on so that we would have room for the wonderful food to come. In all we had four appetizers, two steak cuts, three accompaniments, and four dessert samplers. We plan another trip in May and I will be making reservations well in advance.
4 stars on everything other than their steak. Not that the steak was bad, but that would only register a 3.5 stars. Their cauliflower was crazy awesome, as were other sides and appetizers. Overall experience gets 4 stars.
We had a reservation and arrived 30 minutes early, planning on a short wait. They had a table openining and were quick to clear it and get us seated.. . We had the Domestic Nagyu Chef's tasting.. . Appetizer:. - Shrimp Cocktail. Shrimp prepared perfectly and a cocktail sauce with perfect amount of bite.. . Three small salads:.  - Arugala Salad I am not a fan of Arugala salad, but theirs was excellent..  - Persian Cucumber and Watercress, was better than average..  - Itallian Buffalo Mozzarella with Hazelnuts, added a little twist that was very nice. .  . Steaks:. Ribeye and Filet for the cuts of meat. Both cooked to perfection and as very delicious.. . Sides:.  - Brissel Sprouts, in season so on everyones menu and they didn't dissapoint.  - Au Gratin Potatoes, found out that my mother was undercooking the potatoes for my entire life. Both happy and sad at the same time, because I always loved my moms Au Gratin. Even if she were alive, I would have never told her this.. . Deserts:.  - Cinnamon Monkey Bread w/Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - Awesome.  - Sorbets, Coconut Lime and Rasberry.  - Chocolate Indulgence - Close second.  - Farmers Market Fruit. . . The only let down to the entire meal was that they brought us four deserts when two would have sufficed... It is simply too much after that much provided in the prior courses.. . The service was top nothc from start to finish. A must stop for anyone. I am glad we did the tasting because I would have missed out on some excellent items i would have otherwise not have tried.
Absolutely amazing. Not much to add that other's haven't said. The tasting menu is expensive really god damn excellent in terms of getting a taste for the whole menu. Also, more steakhouses should have an entire mushroom section of their menu.
I actually had low expectations, as I had bad experience at Collichio & Sons in NY and the MGM shopping mall is not that amazing either. But was pleasantly surprised at this place. The space is large and beautiful so you don't even think about being in the middle of a shit mall. The staff is friendly. The food was great. The Waygu skirt steak was great and worth the $75. All the sides were yummy. Especially the grits. And the monkey bread dessert was amazing.
Came with a group of 6.. Ordered the group Angus course, which was salads, then steaks and sides. Deserts at the end. Comes out to $129/ per person.. I enjoyed most of the salads, except the kale - heavily salted. . The steak cuts were mostly enjoyable. The horse raddish sauce was powerful. . Of the sides, I enjoyed the pureed potato the most.. The deserts were good, but overkill after all of that. Not a bad deal though.. . My biggest gripe is with their sommelier and their wine list. She needs a clue: . . I wanted a good dinner wine. I usually like leathery Grenache wines from Rhone Valley. I've had great ones for $40-$80 per bottle. Dinner wine/table wine. Instead, I'm inundated with a list of $1000 to $12000 wines. I like table wines. Great wines can be had for under $100. If a sommelier needs to keep pointing at pricey wines in order to recommend me a good wine for dinner, then they're not doing their job to me. They are a piss poor sommelier. . . I just want a decent dinner wine at a fair price. Get a god damn clue, and save your most over-priced grape juices for the whales. Understand how to read your customers so a simple dinner doesn't have to be so awkward and idiotic.. . I had to settle for a martini and a beer rather than a reasonable wine to go with my dinner. I was annoyed by that.. . Summary: . . Pro:. Steaks were decent.. Most of the appetisers were decent.. Some of the sides were great.. Decadent Deserts.. . Con:. 1.) They wouldn't take phone reservations. Forced us to come downstairs and forced us to wait around.. 2.) There needs to be a reasonable wine list for reasonable people - some of those thousand dollar wines are to be savored for an experience someone might want. I want a decent dinner wine. Get a clue.. . For half the price, I had a better experience at Wolfgang's CUT
wow, wow and wow. the hostesses are smokin hot, the tables are fancy and good sized, the chairs are comfy.. the food. . holy crap the food. . We tried to call the hotel concierge for reservations and were told 10 pm was the next available (it was 6:45) so we decided to walk downstairs. Oddly enough we were seated immediately.. I had the Wagyu Ribeye. It was phenomenal.. My wife and daughter, the filet. The cut was epic. i've never seen a larger piece.. the service was impeccable, i was overall impressed beyond amazement. . . On that note......... our total bill was $394.77 including tip, for 3. So as much as i was impressed, it damn well better have been amazing. . . final summation, very good value.
Food was good. Not bad but I would not go back. Service was so slow I wanted to kill myself....Our service a Swiss older gentleman was really nice , however the service was soooo slow , i wanted to go tosleep and dream about Pink Panther ( don't ask me why). The steaks were all yummy. I got filet mignon. Perfectly cooked.. Sides were good but nothing special. The mushroom was a let down.. Dessert-- monkey bread was OMG so gooood.
I had a signature ribeye steak here. Very juicy and good flavor. The food and atmosphere had a certain memorability to it. Totally recommend. The potatoes au gratin. Off the hook!! Ok that sounds corny. But they were...
