yummy yummy yummy!!! hubby and i come here the girls are always nice...busy but nice. and they got mussels too...yummmmm!!!
Really fun experience with good friends! I've never worn gloves and a bib and had my food brought to me in a bag and shared with the table. It was messy and delicious and we got Cajun spices all over our beer glasses. :) . . I have no idea how much it cost because my buddy grabbed the bill, but we got 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crab and 2 pounds of mussels to split between three people. It sounds like alot, but it was just enough, actually. Plus it came with a little corn on the cob and a little potato for each of us. We chose the medium level of spice, which was plenty spicy for me! . . So this is food you have to WORK for. You have to tear the heads and legs off of the shrimp and peel them and you have to crack open your crab legs and pry the meat out. But it's WORTH it! The mussels required NO work and were delicious. The shrimp was, ya know, shrimp. The crab was delectable - I freakin' love a good juicy piece of crab meat. :) . . We felt like three ravenous animals tearing apart food with our hands and leaving a mess of shells and sea creature parts behind. Awesome. . . My boyfriend was not a fan of the chicken tenders he ordered; he said they were slightly worse than the kind you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. And they didn't have BBQ sauce, just ketchup and not-so-good ranch. So yeah. Get the seafood.
YUMMY!  Yes, good thing for the bibs, becuase it will get messy, but it is well worth it! I recommend getting the hot and Juicy Special seasoning on your crawfish. awesome flavor.  We also tried the soft shell crab, that was also good.  . We will definately return next time we are in Las Vegas.  Excellent service, great food.
My friends and I went here when we visited Vegas. The crabs were very flavorful and cooked correctly. My friend got shrimp and it was good as well, not greasy at all. I would definitely go back. Tip: If you stay on the strip, you will need to catch a taxi to get here, but it should be no more than 10-15 min (Vegas traffic contingent).
Here is best place to me and my boyfriend!!! We like to enjoy with spicy food .. That's why we always order shrimp with extra spicy!!!!! And we often order potato with shrimp......  This combo is so fantastic !
We came in for the weekend and stayed at the Rio which a 5 minute cab ride and all I can say is wow...this place is really great. Anyone that eats at a buffet in on the casinos instead if getting out and trying a great local place like this is crazy. We tried just about everything they had but favorite was the head on shrimp and the mussels. The crawfish were kind of undersized so I will stay away from that next time. We had the extra hot and it was perfect--not unbearably hot but it had a great flavor. The only warning I have about this place is that someone doesn't like seafood or the smell of seafood don't bring them with you. This is a must try place in Vegas at a very reasonable price. Oh and the wait staff was very helpful for us first timers
Not too bad of a wait if you get there on the later side. Delicious and MESSY. Be prepared to smell like your food for the rest of the night (Especially if your bearded like myself).
A lover of crawfish and all there is seafood - this is the place to go. Their seasoning is excellent. It may be pricy but totally worth it. The servers are very friendly and are always willing to answer any questions.
