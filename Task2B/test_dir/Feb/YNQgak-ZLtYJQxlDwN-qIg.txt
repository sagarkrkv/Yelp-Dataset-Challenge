Great food and atmosphere. Only thing though, there's not many stalls in the restroom so if you gotta poop, which you will, give yourself some lead time.. . For me, I had to use the restroom which is located outside of the buffet because I could not wait any longer.. . Bottom line is, when you gotta go you gotta give yourself some lead time.
Vibe- Cheerful Cafeteria. . Price- $20 breakfast. . Service- Self. . Food- Overall the food at breakfast is OK. The quality is just not here anymore. The croissants are a must have. The pancakes get hard fast from sitting out too long. Bagels taste like they are from a grocery store bag. Pizza is disappointing. . . Lunch is much better. The overall assortment of meats and everything else trumps the breakfast selections.. . Desserts look impressive but taste less impressive. . Bathroom - Small one in buffet itself. But larger one in the hotel lobby. . The Bellagio Buffet is still the best in Sin City. . WIGB? Yes
This has become a staple for our Las Vegas trips.. . The dinner buffet is so delicious. Amazing salad bars and great little fruit/cheese area. Yum lots of good cheeses. Tons of carving stations and the pumpkin gnocchi was to die for! Absolutely delicious. This is the ONLY buffet I feel is really worth the money and the hassle of buffets. TRY IT! Plus The decor is beautiful :)
I can't really say anything good about this place!!!! Definitely not worth paying the dinner price... Unless you like to feel that you've been violated. Didn't try the breakfast but both lunch and dinner were disappointments. You've been warned!
Take it from a local who's tried almost every buffet in town... if you only try one buffet in Vegas, let it be at the Wynn. . . Tips: . . - Dinner has much more variety than lunch, I'd wait for dinner. . . - First timers at the Wynn: Currently, you can signup for the rewards card and earn points for the buffet. So if you're already planning on gambling... . . - Save room for dessert
My bf and I went for Sunday brunch. We had a great experience. There was a nice variety of foods, a pancake bar, fresh cut slabs of maple mustard black pepper bacon, and a surprisingly tasty assortment of condiments like strawberry chili jam. I wasn't impressed with the croissants or cinnamon rolls, kind of hard and crumbly, but I'm not really a pastry lover anyway so not a loss. I'm not a dessert lover either, but the desserts were amazing and very memerable.  All I need now is a nap.
As good as it gets in terms of a buffet.
the hand sushi roll was good. Other than that, i was not impressed.
In my opinion, the 2nd best buffet after the Cosmo buffet, but a lot of my friends and family prefer this one instead. Still, there is no doubt that this is a true 5 star buffet- one of the only true 5 star buffets in the world.. . Designed with the utmost attention to detail in its looks and culinary offering, The Buffet at Wynn has an amazing salad bar, entrees, excellent meat selections for the steak lovers- lunch, brunch, and dinner have been fantastic here. . . There is a bathroom in the buffet. Come expecting a 20-30 minute line.
I came here today in the afternoon because i wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day with my gf. Folllw moat ppl's strategy, i arrived before 3 so i could enjoy dinner cuisine with 'unch price...salmon was so good, i ate a lot!!!!! Prime rib, turkey brace, and lamb were my favorite protein food...also had some crab leg, such a nice place..i will bring my family here next time . You guys must vistit this place!!!
Amazing!!!! The number 1 on my list so far aside from wicked spoon. Decor is amazing! They have one room for desserts, pancake station, alcohol spiked fruit, I am in love with this place!
This by far has been the best buffet I have ever been too! . . My girlfriend and I got a cool little package offer from Encore... Because we're cool like that! And it included a free show and free buffet. Last time we booked this offer the line was ridiculously long so we left. This time we went early around 9:30am and it was a quick line. We ended up staying so late that they brought out the lunch food, which we were able to get a little taste of. . . The breakfast buffet offered a variety of things such as cereal, different style of eggs, different types of pancakes (at the pancake station), Asian food, sea food, different meats (sausage, ham, bacon), different types of breads, etc! . . The dessert station had a wide variety of pastries, cookies, and ice cream.. . The best part of it all bottomless mimosas! . . You want to go to a good buffet in Vegas go to the best, and Wynn is the best!
I'm not much a fan of buffets, but since we were staying at the Wynn and heard the hype (and people flocking in from other Vegas hotels just to eat this), we had to give it a try.. . The weekend buffet was $33, which is a bargain considering the quality and diversity of the food.  Plus $33 doesn't get you much anywhere in Vegas restaurants anymore, so why not!. . 75% of the stuff we put on our plate was fantastic, the other 25% was average.  But for a buffet, that's really good in my opinion.  You can get anything from Lobster Quiche, to Sushi, to Fried Chicken and Waffles.  And then after your first 5000 calories, the desert bars are impossible to pass up.. . You won't eat again all day and well worth the wait!
Truly wasn't too happy about this buffet. Especially since were at the Wynn, the buffet should be as great as the restaurant. The food wasn't kept hot and was pretty bland. I wouldn't recommend coming to this buffet. However if you're looking for the best buffet in Vegas go to wicked spoon in the Cosmo. You'll never go to any other buffet after that.
Omg this place is amazing I've been twice once with my mom and once with friends the food and dessert is amazing and I'm seriously a picky person when it comes to food.  $42 all you can eat in a weekday yes plz and Omg the ambiance with the flowers and stuff was so nice. Definitely worth the trip for dinner yummy food omg.
Saw a lot of good reviews for this place so since we were there we decided to make it a must to try out.  The line was very deceiving, they will have you line up outside the buffet and once you make it inside there's another long wrap around line just like the amusement parks.  The wait wasn't too bad when we arrived around 10 in the morning.  We made it in within 15~20 minutes I believe. They have an alcohol package for an additional 15$ and you can choose whatever drink from their menu you want with as many refills as you please.  Very decorative inside with a very flowery garden theme.  The food choice was amazing!  Let alone was there a lot to choose from but the quality of thefood was superb as well.  The most random thing we noticed about the buffet was that it served congee which was very rare.  We enjoyed their congee along with their selection of ice creams.  I wish I could've ate more but I felt I got my moneys worth, a quick tip about the dessert section.  Stay away from the baked goods since they've been sitting out for a while.  I got a muffin and stabbing it with a fork did not pierce it, it actually cracked like a cracker.  Overall have a good eating if you're able to make it to this buffet!
Brunch was well worth the price.  I loved the smoked salmon and smoked salmon salad...delicious!!!  Although the prime rib tasted old but most of everything else I tried was good.  They kept the serving areas clean, A+.
This is the buffet that my girlfriends and i I always go to when we are in Vegas!. . Atmosphere: this is a super pretty buffet. The ceilings assays half transparent with tons of flowers and flower made arches around the dining area. The food sections were pretty nicely decorated as well. The dessert section almost looked like a dream land for girls haha. You can check the pictures on yelp, I don't think I need to describe too much here.. . Food: I would recommend: sashimi salmon, Japanese seaweed salad, tequila spiced watermelon, all the sushi ( they're all pretty fresh), congee( omg you have to get this! They have pork sung, thousand year old egg, Chinese donut and many many more options for you to put in your congee. It was legit! One white man behind me kept asking me what's that blue thing and I said its egg. He asked why is it blue... And I said it's fermented and you have to try it it tastes different from regular egg. And he decided to get a bowl of congee as well haha), French toast that's coated wi granola, prime rib, lobster quiche like thingy, apple salad, pancake ( you can make it your own with a lot of different things for topping it was so goodddd) and their ice cream( we tried all the flavors- mango sorbet, vanilla, chocolate, espresso, mint chocolate, pistachio! They were all very good and flavorful!) my friends also liked the ice cream sandwich which I highly recommend! I bet that you will find many things that you will enjoy!. . Price - it was about $35 for lunch buffet which was not bad at all.. . Service: it's a buffet so don't expect good service. Our waitress seemed super busy and it was hard to go find her. I wanted another glass of lemonade but she was in no where to be found. The cashier also double charged my credit card. Good thing that I found out otherwise I'd rather go to a super good steakhouse for $70+ instead of a buffet.. Now it's kinda annoying that I need to check my credit card for a few times to make sure they reimbursed me.. Ugh. . I hope that they had lobsters or crabs or oysters at the seafood section.
This place is amazing!!! So many desserts & made it order pancakes :] and the are delish!
I'll make this short! . Looked for a weekend brunch for a girls weekend. The Buffet at Wynn had great reviews so we decided to give it a go. . . The wait was no joke! Be prepared to wait in line 45 mins to an hour on the weekend. . . There's a huge selectionof different cuisines, which was nice but I didn't have anything that was just spectacular. . . They do have a $15 package for unlimited mimosas, wine, beer so that was definitely a plus! Our server kept our flutes filled at ALL times! ;) . . Their dessert bar was impressive. . . I'd go back just for champagne and dessert!
On the more expensive side, but definitely worth the price - the best buffet we went to on our trip. And let's be honest, if you're eating brunch here, you probably won't need to eat a real meal for the rest of the day (probably just a small dinner). Wynn definitely has the most variety for brunch, and I love the layout of the place. Come hungry, and if you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait for a while. The line moves fast though.. . Highlights: thick smoked bacon with honey mustard, prime rib (best I tried in all my meals here), seared salmon, grilled pineapple with rum and coconut milk. Also has the standard shrimp, smoked salmon, eggs, and tons of breakfast things - make your own pancakes and omelets, as well as sushi and a bunch of other random delicious things. . . Desserts are a world (and room) of their own! You can order your own ice cream sandwich with their gelato and any of their homemade cookies. For dairy free peeps, strawberry and mango sorbet are great. They also had a gluten and dairy free coconut tropical tapioca pudding, which was great!
The Wynn's buffet was very good, features were the crab legs that are already split down the middle, the italian food section, the chef will cook you up just about anything you want and crepes in the desert section. A little pricey at 40 bucks during dinner on the weekends.
There was every kind of food imaginable,but the only problem is the quality was not consistent. My boyfriend and I got this as part of our stay at the Encore, so we came for brunch on our last day in Vegas, only because it was free. . . We were told this was one of the better buffets in Vegas, and it was OK, but I expected more. It was decorated very prettily and the service was fast, but the food didn't quite cut it. I was imaging something completely different. I imagined grass fed beef, and the food to taste fresher, but that didn't happen. . . There is an italian, Mexican, pizza, seafood, omelete station, and every kind of dessert imaginable, etc. . . It was a beautiful place to eat with large flower arrangements everywhere, floating above the tables, but because the food was just average and tasted a bit stale from sitting under the heat lamps, we don't really feel the urge to return here. . . I recommend trying this place if it comes with your stay, but otherwise, try some of the other brunch places in Vegas for the same price.
This buffet is typical and nothing extraordinary.. The carver for the meats is not very generous or polite like many buffets.. The cashiers were very nice and the waiter too.
It was very quaint and lovely. Not the biggest menu but quality food. Everything tasted yummy and I think the best dessert selection. Especially for the price. Service was bad though....
