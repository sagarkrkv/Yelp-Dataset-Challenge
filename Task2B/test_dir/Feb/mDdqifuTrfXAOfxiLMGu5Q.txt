Everything was absolutely perfect.  I started with Kobe beef tartar, the dish was smoked and had a wonderful light citrus flavor.  Main dish was Beef Wellington and I can't explain how amazing it was.  Meat was a perfect medium rare and the surrounding puff pastry was light and flaky.  I also tried a side of Mac n Cheese.  Never have I had a better dish of Mac n Cheese, creamy baked spot on with a little crunch.  I can't wait to go back.  Of course it is expensive but taking into account where and what you are getting it is defiantly worth the splurge.
I was looking forward to this restaurant for months, as Gordan Ramsay is one of my hero's and let me say it did not disappoint.. . The girlfriend had the Beef Wellington which was absolutely delicious.  I had the rib cap which was to die for.  And get the mac and cheese...it was all so amazing.  Just a shame Gordon wasn't there today, would have loved to see him.  I will always remember this meal.
Following our short, but very sweet wedding ceremony at Caesars, the newly minted wife and I and our guests made our way across the Strip to Paris and Gordon Ramsay Steak for our reception dinner.  We'd dined there back in July '13 in the main dining room and had been suitably impressed enough to select it for our post-wedding celebration.  After confirming that it offered private rooms (I saw a total of three room...there could be more) up on the second level that could accommodate a party of 15 comfortably, we were sold.  We arrived a few minutes early for our 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  The dining room and bar were pretty much at capacity.  We were led upstairs to our room.  One of our party required the use of a walker.  No worries, as there was an elevator next to the staircase leading upstairs.  . . Since it was the wife and my party, we opted for the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu for the group.  The menu was virtually the same as the one we'd had previously although the salad and dessert courses had changed.  When we made the reservations and laid down the deposit, we asked to have the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream instead of the listed dessert and they graciously agreed.    . . Our final menu was the following:. Amuse Bouche - Scotch Egg with Berkshire pork sausage & red wine braised cabbage. First Course - Spring Vegetable Salad, fennel seared ahi, pea shoots, asparagus and candied rhubarb. Second Course - Scallop Risotto with seared scallop, spring mushroom farro risotto, black trumpet puree, grilled ramp. Third Course - Roasted Beef Wellington with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and red wine demi glace. Dessert Course - Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream. . Each course was beautiful in its presentation and executed perfectly.  Our guests were all smiles after each course.  Portion sizes were plentiful, yet never oversized.  Even my mom who eats like a bird finished every last bite.  However, the dessert course seemed to be the one that everyone raved about the most!      . . Service throughout our meal was impeccable as we were attended to in a friendly and efficient manner.  Water glasses were always topped off and cocktail and wine service was fast and knowledgeable.   The sommelier guided us to a great bottle of wine, Dutch Henry Winery 2007 Napa Valley CS.  One of the most memorable sights was seeing 15 servers serve each course in front of each of the 15 guests in our party simultaneously.  Maybe it was to be expected, but it's the little touches that often make the lasting impression.     . . The only critique I have from our experience was how it ended.  Our lead server asked the wife if she'd like to finish off our night with coffee and cognac service.  She said, "Yes," and soon a tray with three different bottles of cognac appeared.  While the names of the bottles of cognac were given, unfortunately not the cost for each 1.5 oz pour.  As a result, a few glasses of Louis XIII were ordered, one of which was by my dad who had no idea of its cost and I think ordered it because it came in a striking bottle.  He nearly had a heart attack when he found out how much it cost.  At least he enjoyed it!  Still, this pricey hiccup aside, our meal was exceedingly satisfying.  Our guests pushed back from the table quite pleased...and, most importantly, the experience will be one the wife and I won't ever forget.
Very impressed. I'm not sure it gets better than this. If you're planning a visit to Vegas and want to splurge a night for a nice dinner, Gordon Ramsays Steak is a must.
Ambiance was great, but service was lacking and slow  Our party of five spent about $1000.  I waited 20 minutes for my hot tea after asking twice.  My frend ordered the NY strip and he was brought a ribeye.  He ordered a Scotch and it came with a sno-cone amount of ice...!!!  When the waiter replaced his drink, it was obvious that the bartender had just dumped the now watered-down Scotch into a new glass.. . Food was good, but not the best. For a similar price point, I'd go to Ruth's Chris or Maestros.
Today was my first visit here with my girlfriend for my birthday.  I have to say food was great but extremely upset with my waiter. His name was Chris. I have been wanting to come here for months and my girlfriend surprised me today. We were the first to be seated in his area. He asked if we wanted cocktails I responded no since my gf was not in the mood to drink and I was driving. After that came the snobbyness. He asked everyone but us if today was a special occasion with everyone responding no. Yet the one who was there on a special occasion, this guy writing the review, did not get asked until after I asked my neighbors in front of him why they were asked and I wasn't . Then came the fake congratulations from him. It gets better. I ordered the wellington I've been craving since I saw it on the F word a few years ago. It was given to my gf not me and I got her spare ribs. So we had to switch it in front of him and he said I ordered it the other way. I assure you, I did not.  The food was amazing! But ruined by this terrible server. He walked past me 6 times and I repeat 6 times after me and my gf had finished eating our food. Clean plates and all! Staring at him as he walked past me several times until I finally got upset and said "Look chris, you have walked past us several times and we would like to look at the desert menu." He answered back " oh I thought you were still working on your meal" he then cleaned our table after awhile and wondered why we decided not to get a desert after all. I just explained you lose your craving after such a long wait. The funny thing is I never thought I would ever write a review on a place and much less a negative review. But I have to say love the food, but the waiter was extremely rude and condescending.  Oh and to anyone who sits in his area if you say no to cocktails be prepared but if you're like my neighbors and ordered cocktails and wines you will get decent service from him. Not sure I would return here, which is upsetting, seeing as how I always rambled on to my gf and friends about Ramsay's shows.  Great job on the food Christina from hell's kitchen. Memorable dinner, too bad for the wrong reasons.
Wow & yum! . Dennis & Adrian are quite a team. We went to GR Steak for my birthday, our server Dennis could not have made it more special. Every time he came to our table, it was with a huge smile and new birthday wish! His menu recommendations were spot on and his enthusiasm was second to none! Adrian, his assistant has such genuine and positive energy and they really made our night special. Oh and then there's the food...wow! I had the filet and like it med-well. Dennis suggested they butterfly it. I have never been offered that at any steakhouse...it is my new way to order it...it was cooked all the way through, no pink (no fun for most people but just the way I like it)...all the while not compromising the juice factor and the flavor. Oh, the melt in your mouth flavor! My husband ordered the rib eye cooked medium and it was perfection on a plate! The potato puree was like the world's best mashed potatoes! Rainbows and unicorns appear when you put a forkful in your mouth and tranquil music plays as they melt on your tongue. The drinks were amazing...something about the special glasses  they choose for each made them taste that much better! We finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the peanut butter something or other...they were delectably delicious! The ice cream for each is presented like a stick of butter with a little ice cream butter knife...so bizarre yet wonderfully fun and yummy! We are locals and will be back! Thanks Dennis & Adrian for making our special night even more special!
If you are truly a foodie, you should not pass up a visit to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Las Vegas.  First, I would like to thank Mike our server, and especially Muhammad for the excellent service!  We were seated in a booth on the second floor- very comfortable.  The only flaw was that music was quite loud- interestingly though, we were able to have a good conversation without yelling.  I had the Kobe beef, which was incredible, and my husband had lamb chops and shepherds pie. He decided he is not really a lamb fan, but the shepherds pie was amazing.  The sides were huge.  Had we realized this, we would only have ordered two.  As it was, we ordered three and took a loaded baked potato with us untouched.  The green beans and creamed spinach were super!  As wonderful as dinner was, the sticky toffee pudding was even better.  Again- big portions.  Everything was bigger and more filling than it appeared.  For the quality and quantity, I was pleasantly surprised with a tab under $200.  A word about dress code... I am not sure if there is one, and my husband and I were in jeans with nice tops.  We felt very comfortable in what we had on, but did notice that most everyone else was dressed up a bit more than that.  So if you are wondering- err on the side of a bit nicer over a bit more casual.   It was a great experience!
It was everything I hoped it would be and more!  From the light as air potato gnocchi , to the literally melt in your mouth short ribs , to the silky puree's. Really out standing. Really. Very nice wine list selection. Service was prompt, friendly and extremely attentive.
The restaurant was nice and cozy. Being that we would like to try different things are the menu a few of us split the entre. I had the pan seared foie gras and lamb and both were amazing!!!. . The tropical panna cotta dessert was yummy!!!
This was not just a great meal but an amazing experience! The attention to detail, level of professionalism and ultimately the food was 2nd to none. We also had the flagship 5 course meal and while the quantities as stated were small, the taste sensations were unbelievable. The pace of the courses is just right to enjoy the decadence of each, cleanse your pallet and enjoy the ambiance. I left feeling content not stuffed. The signature course also comes with a menu card and autographed picture of Chef Ramsay in a hard backed black envelope. Another great touch that just solidifies why he has attained the status he has. Thanks to all the Chefs and staff for a great evening!
I only have one word to describe this place... UH-MAY-ZING!!!. . The ambiance has a modern, fun and upscale feel. The service was wonderful and top notch. And the food... WOW!!! I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsay (especially with HK) and I've been dying to try one of his restaurants.   This definitely exceeded my expectations... I had the bone in ribeye and it was just filled with flavor and extremely juicy and tender. My mouth waters just thinking of it. I ate till I couldn't eat and still shoved more because it was just too delicious!!!. . Major kuddos to Gordon Ramsay Steak!!!
Gordon Ramsey's STEAK restaurant had great atmosphere and the staff was very friendly however, I do have a few complaints, myself and my party of approximately 5 others sat up stairs around a large round table which seemed to sit relatively close to the other tables and patrons and normally this would not have been but because of the close proximity of the tables the wait staff continually pushed (vigorously) against my chair as they passed through to serve the patrons at the table beside mine and this proved to be rather annoying as the evening went on. Other than the table issue that was my only complaint about the wait staff or the restaurant itself, now on to thefood, the steak was delicious! I ordered a cut called the "rib cap" which as the server stated this is "Gordon Ramsey's" favorite because it is a cross between two other cuts. My steak was medium and cooked to absolute perfection, the flavor was wonderful and the texture was like butter! Steak definitely is their speciality however everything else was pretty subpar or not worthy of a $800 check. The fingerling potatoes were equivalent to almost any restaurant as was the Mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts, I expected the sides to be much better but the quality just wasn't there. My wife ordered the sea bass which was visually beautiful but definitely left much to be desired in the flavor department, I was really disappointed with her dish because although I realize we are in the middle of the desert, I would have hoped the fish would still have been better than those found throughout restaurants in Las Vegas. Their saving grace however, the drinks were amazing and I highly recommend the "south side" which is a play on a mojito but uses champagne.
Well put meal! From appetizer to entree to dessert..wish we could have the regular menu but it was Valentine's day and it wasnt. Although we were a little upset we stayed anyway and tried what they had on their tasting menu..Awesome awesome awesome..we will definitely be back to try the steaks
This was a fantastic dinner. Bone-in ribeye, beef Wellington, beet root salad, onion ale soup, and topped it off with sticky toffee pudding. The service was also amazing. Dennis and Mohamadu were great!
The drinks, bread, steak were all delicious! Our waiter was extremely helpful and attentive. My only issue was the hostess.. On the way out we asked how to get to the main entrance and she gave us the dirtiest look and gave us directions as if we bothered her.. I didn't get her name but she had big fake lips.
FOIE GRAS FOR A CALIFORNIAN. . Anyone who's read my profile knows my love for foie gras. Because of the California ban on foie gras it is very difficult get this delicacy. After the ban the last time I had foie gras was when Psycho Donuts in San Jose were giving free foie gras donuts. Yesterday on my last night at Vegas I came here for dinner. There were two items I had in mind: 1) Hudson Valley Foie Gras 2) Beef Wellington. I waited in anticipation for both items. The first dish was the foie gras. When I took a bite of this foie gras it reminded me when I last had foie gras at a California restaurant after the ban - it was at Boulevard in San Francisco. I took my time eating this foie gras. I cut the foie gras into thin slices. I placed the thin slices of foie gras with the bite sizes of pumpkin waffle. This provided a typical contrast of savory and sweet texture. I treated this foie gras dish as if it was the main dish. The main dish the Beef Wellington takes about 45 minutes to cook. I never had Beef Wellington before and it was worth the wait. The pastry had that golden crust. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. Some people think a steak that is medium rare is too red. I never understood some people's fascination of a well done steak. For the amount of money you pay fora great quality steak why destroy the quality of the meat. What I love about the Beef Wellington that it's only cooked one way - medium rare only. Chef Ramsay is making the statement that customers have to adjust to him and not the other way around. The customer is not always right. Overall having dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak with a chance to have foie gras was great way to have dinner on my last night in Vegas.
Amazing. Amazing. And we're hard to please. From start to finish they treated us right. We had reservations, and as soon as we got to the desk out front the hostess took us inside to seat us. Did not have to go to the bar first- as a matter of fact, I barely saw it as we went through, then up the stairs to our huge gorgeous booth. We had a 'dining attendant', Ben, and a waiter, whose name escapes me but he was wonderful. We ordered the pork belly appetizer, clam chowder and beet salads to start, had the beef wellington (how could you not), and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Not to mention 2 plates of the outrageous breads. My husband had a glass of Guinness, perfectly poured. .      It was all exactly as we hoped, and wanted. The food was perfect. The dining attendant clears your place setting between courses; I got a new fork and knife every time we got a new plate, and they whisk your empties away as you finish. I never felt rushed or pushed on, and I'm sensitive to that. I like to be left alone to dine, and I never felt like they wanted me to leave or anything like that. .      Yes, the music was a little loud, but so are the patrons, if we'd been downstairs perhaps it would have been worse. We did see Christina the HK winner from season 10, she walked by our table twice to meet a VIP, then downstairs on our way to the restrooms we watched her expedite the food. My husband actually bumped into her from behind on accident and she was gracious about it. If only we'd gotten a photo with her. .      I absolutely cannot wait to return to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.
Top of the line service from the moment we walked in the door. Fantastic food. I ordered the filet med rare and my husband ordered the beef Wellington, Mac and cheese and loaded potato. Everything was delicious! Favorite part of the meal was the chocolate spoons to put in your coffee with dessert. Worth every penny! Only thing that would make this experience better if Gordon was here!
This restaurant is just beyond amazing, we went a few months ago and I don't even know why I waited this long to review it. I don't remember our serves name but he was so attentive and answered all of our questions. The bread that they brought us to us came with this amazing butter OMG if you don't try anything else at least try their butter I know it sounds weird but it was the best thing ever. . . I don't remember what everyone in my party orders but I ordered the duck dish and it was fall off the bone tender and delicious. I really recommend this place to anyone traveling through Paris. . . Great food, amazing service and perfect ambiance. What else can I girl ask for? . . We will definitely go back to this restaurant over and over again.
I could go on and onhere but there are 2 reasons this place gets 5 stars:. . 1. The Beef Wellington is perfect. There's no ordering it how you want it done, it comes medium rare & it's made how God intended this dish to be done. The rest of the cuts looked amazing as well but because this is such a specialty dish credit has to be given where credit is due.... . 2. Impeccable service. Our server was knowledgeable, courteous, attentive...really made this a great experience. . . When in Vegas make this a must...
I went to the Paris Hotel back in May and got an chance to eat the Gordon Ramsey's Steak.  The decor was very nice and had a real electric vibe to it.. . Anyway our waiter brought out a large display of raw meat we could choose from.  I chose 2 cuts of steak.. . First I had a garden salad that I will not waste my time writing about and a British Ale Onion Soup.  This was the best French Onion Soup I ever had.  The ale made the soup very rich and delicious.  The cheese was perfectly melted and complimented the taste of the ale nicely.. . I had the 24oz Bone-In Ribeye.  This steak was cooked perfectly.  It had a perfect char on the outside and was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  the flavor and texture of this moist cut of meat was outstanding. I was told the steak was a Pat LeFrieda Steak.. . Our waiter recommended the American Rib Cap 8oz.  There was nothing wrong with this cut, but there was nothing special to it.  the bone in was better in my opinion.. . For sides we had the Sauteed Spinach and Mac N Cheese.  They were ok.  . . I would go again to eat the Bone-In Ribeye.
I can't say I am a fan of Gordon himself as I don't watch his shows but while in vegas me and the wife were looking to have a good steak dinner and thought we would try it out. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and modern looking. If you plan to go you will definitely need a reservation as it does seem to be pretty busy all the time..  Our waiter was great...knowledgable and explained the menu pretty well. They use iPads to show off their wine list and drinks which was pretty cool. Now to the food... We passed on the prepackaged meal for two and decided to order whatever we wanted. I didn't care about getting an autographed picture with it anyway! My wife and I decided on the Kobe beef sliders for an appetizer...they tell you appetizers are really single portions but we didn't want to fill up so we split the two sliders. They were pretty damn good...next we ordered Kobe filets and added two side dishes to the meal, the Mac and cheese and the potatoes. The filet was excellent. Very tender and tasty..Mac and cheese was awesome...the potatoes were just ok. To top off the meal we decided to have the sticky toffee dessert which is not bad at all. So in all the food was good...was it worth the $300 check at the end ehhhhh not sure. I think you pay for the experience and the Gordon Ramsey name. What kinda put a damper on the experience is burping up the macaroni flavor for the next 3-4 hours after dinner. My wife and I both looked at each other at some point and mentioned this taste kept popping back up the rest of the night. Not sure what was going on with that . We do frequent steak places wherever we travel and I don't think there was a huge difference between this place and another favorite place of ours in Lake Tahoe that is half the price. Go for the experience if you are a fan but bring your wallet and watch out for the macaroni burps!
We've been before, but this was our first pass at the revised menu for 2014.  Outstanding!  (especially if you are a Hell's Kitchen fan, their HK package is much more closely aligned with the show than it was previously).  The service was impeccable and the food even better!. . If you've ever wondered if Gordon Ramsay demands as much perfection from his own staff as he does people on TV.. well, the answer is: he demands MORE from his own staff and chefs, and they deliver.  Don't pass up the chance to eat here if you can possibly swing it.
I don't know what there is left to say about this amazing place. Modern, fancy, professional, classy,... many positive adjectives to describe the ambiance and taste of the food.. . - Reservations recommended. - If you have not had their famous beef wellington, get it. - Server comes and presents you with 2 menus. 1.) preset course for $$$$ amount or 2.) choose your own from their full menu. - Server comes and presents you a display of all their meat cuts to give you a visual of the meat cuts. Very helpful. - I love it when I am able to say "you can't go wrong with anything" here... all the choices are top notch - from appetizer to dessert. . - I ended up shelling out way more than I anticipated but definitely worth the experience both visually and for my palate. (with appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert, and 2 drinks - around $350). . If you are a Gordon Ramsay fan and have the funds to dish out, a must try if you are in Vegas.. . GO GO GO GO GO!
My husband and I decided to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary here. We are big Gordon fans, watched all his shows and have paid close attention to his career. . . The atmosphere was modern and they were playing todays hits. So definitely attracting a younger crowd. When first stepping into the restaurant by your own personal host, you go through a tunnel like bar that was suppose to be your transition into London town! The place also had two levels. With upstairs seating on a balcony type of feel. We were seated upstairs. . . Even though we went on a Tuesday night, we did notice the restaurant was on a roll, with a lot of customers coming in and out. Which did mean we did wait a little before finally putting in our order. When it was our turn we were greeted with a meat presentation! Explaining all the different steaks offered on the menu and how each one will taste as well as how it is cooked. It was very helpful! . . For starters they served us three different types of bread. One including truffles.. oh my Goodness it was devine! We also ordered Kobe beef sliders, and I must say it was the juiciest slider I have ever tasted. The kobe beef was extremely tender and full of flavor. Melted in our mouths! . For our main course my husband and I ended up ordering the 24oz ribeye. Which was definitely the biggest piece of steak I've ever eaten! For our sides we ordered grilled asparagus and a potato puree. Our streak was done medium well. It was delicious!! . . Although the waiter didn't spend too much time with us. We did have a lovely time. I must warn you though with quality you do have to pay, our bill averaged around $250 (including tip). . . Overall we were extremely happy with our experience and the delicious dinner! . . Thank you Gordon for a great time. We will be dining here again soon! :)
I visited with a couple of friends a while ago. I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal consisting of the Naccarri caviar, Maine lobster as appetizers, beef Wellington and a bit of the ribeye as entrees and the sticky toffee pudding as dessert.. . This was actually my first time trying caviar, and I found it to be very decadent. It was also served alongside miniature belgian waffles and other fixins which served as an excellent pairing to the caviar. The lobster was butter poached and cooked very well. However, I found the accompanying cream sauce to be a bit overpowering.. . The beef Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a nice flakey pastry. Definitely was the star of the dish, as the mashed potatoes and carrots were fairly standard. The ribeye was the best cooked ribeye I've had so far, also cooked to a medium rare temperature. Most surprisingly, I found that the fat from the cut of ribeye was cooked extremely well, as it was the first time I've ever experienced the illusive 'melt in your mouth' phenomena. I've never had a steak with fat cooked like that ever since visiting Gordon Ramsay Steak. The steak sauce was extravagant. It had three different flavour profiles, going from slightly hot to a nice plum-like ending.. . Desert was also excellent. I found that the brown butter ice cream (which to me resembled the taste of maple syrup) paired really well with the pudding (an extremely light, fluffy and spongey cake), but the toffee sauce was very sweet. Although I do enjoy sweet desserts, I would avoid pouring too much of the toffee in.. . Overall, a very delectable meal. Very pricy, but equally well worth the money. Altough I usually don't eat like this all the time, given the opportunity in the future, I would gladly return for another meal.
My husband and I went there on 2/19/2014, our last "full" night in Vegas this past trip.  I always wanted to try it but noticed it was rather pricey so I wanted to see what the consensus was before dishing out big bucks.  It was well worth the price though that's for sure.  We are already thinking about what we are going to order the second time around.  Our waiter was Dennis, don't recall the assistant's name but they were both nice.  We did wait a little bit though, which if the prior reviews didn't boast about the excellent service I probably would not have noticed and would have chalked it up to them being very busy.  Prior reviews were correct about the bread selection- all very good.  The salt on the butter was the BOMB!  We skipped appetizers and opted to save room for dessert.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I had the American rib cap.  For our sides we selected the mac/cheese and the truffle fingerling potatoes.  Let me just say- I could have just had the sides as my entree because they were both excellent.  Rich and decadent.  I almost felt guilty eating them.  But they were so good.  And let me say the day after they were just as good.  The American Rib cap, which I never heard of before, was excellent.  8 ounces seemed small but it was packed with flavor and with the sides, well I couldn't finish it.  That too tasted good the day after.  My husband's rib-eye although BIG was just alright.  Meaning we've had bone-ins before.  His had a little more gristle than we prefer so he's thinking he'll go with the rib cap next time.  For dessert, we went with the sticky toffee pudding even though I was a little reluctant after trying the one at BurGR- it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But the one here, at the steak place, was excellent.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  We are ready to go back on our next trip.
This place was delicious!. The servers were very friendly and informative and helped us choose the food that was best. . The service was quick and we were out in plenty of time to see our show!. . Appetizers: my husband had fried pork belly. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Yummo! He is picky - especially about expensive food and he was oohing and ahhh ing the entire time he was eating it . . I got the gnocchi.  It was also very good and a little lighter. . . Both appetizers were delicious. . . Dinner: . We got the beef Wellington for 2. It was incredible. Possibly the best food I've ever eaten. We had mushrooms and the loaded baked potato for sides and the potato was to die for! I don't even know how they make a baked potato taste that good. . . We will definitely be back when we return to Vegas!
Hands down, best steak I've ever had in my life. Service was above and beyond. The recommendation for an accompanying wine with my steak was also top-notch. The place is expensive but deservedly so. If you are a steak lover, this place belongs on your bucket list. Please eat here.
Back for another trip to Steak... Again, the food served far exceeded expectations!!! We decided to go with the shellfish appetizer for the first time, great choice and will be ordering it on our next trip!! . . The reason for the 4 star rating opposed to the usual 5 is for the staff... Not sure if someone called out sick or what the issue was, but our waitress seemed very short with us, at times felt rushed.  The three of us placed our orders... All steaks.. When the plates arrived, we had two steaks and a chicken breast.  Servers immediately corrected this error and we all moved on without any problems.... Then the bill arrived, since our waitress went on break after delivering the check, I had time to review what we ordered against what was on the check.  Everything was charged, along with this mystery baked chicken.  When I brought it to the attention of our waitress, she apologized and corrected the error.  I hate to think like this, but I wonder how often this routine is attempted over a night,.. People know the bill is going to be about 150 per person, have a few drinks, toss in their credit card and move along.  I always give 20% for good service, so I don't feel bad when I give less of a tip for issues such as these.. . Even with the hiccup, we look forward to returning!
I took my husband to GRS for our 24th wedding anniversary. Some friends of our met us there that were from Northern Cali. The beef Wellington was AMAZING!! The meals were AMAZING our waiter was great. Loved loved loved it!!! Was worth every dollar!! Would go again.
This was my 3rd trip to Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris Hotel & Casino in Vegas. My experience was the same the 3rd time as it was the first two visits.  I am only doing a review now as I did not have a Yelp account then. Our reservation was a Sunday night at 5:15pm. We had friends in town who really wanted to try the restaurant. . . Just a side note you have to book reservations well in advance.  This place is very popular and very busy.  We usually book a week in advance to be safe. Sometimes you can get lucky though and get a same dayreservation. The staff is very professional and friendly. Out of curiosity we asked when the last time Chef Ramsay had been to this location and turns out he was there 4 days prior. . . To start the meal, they give you a nice assortment of breads.  As a starter the English Chowder soup is a must try if you are a soup fan. For the main course the signature house dish of Beef Wellington is even better than you think. I haven't really tasted anything else like it. It literally melts in your mouth and comes with a small potato puree and vegetable side.  I think the only thing I don't like is the Mac N Cheese. It has a very unique taste i think due to the truffles used in it is what I heard. 3 out of 4 people at our table were not fans but it is still a popular side.  If you save room for dessert I recommend sharing a Sticky Toffee Pudding with another person. It is pretty rich but I can't think of a better dessert I have had anywhere else.  Next time I visit I am going to try the Wagyu American Rib Cap as it is the 2nd most recommend item not the menu outside of Beef Wellington. . . The only down side besides the Mac N Cheese is when the check comes! You get what you pay for! It is not a cheap restaurant by any means, but then again the quality is great all the way around. I would definitely recommend it for special occasions type of place unless you are rich :)
I can honestly say this is the best restaurant I've ever been to!! Wow, everything about this place was great, service, ambiance, food, everything.  We got the Maine lobster as an appetizer. The lobster was excellent, very unique. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't order Gordon Ramsay's .  beef Wellington and I'm glad I did!!  The Wellington was cooked perfectly, you could cut the filet with a fork ( not kidding ) it came with veggies and mashed potatoes in a glaze sauce. For desert we got the sticky toffee pudding. It was the perfect way to end the meal.  I'm definitely making this place a regular stop when in Vegas!
I love Gordon Ramsey and his steakhouse is better than his regular restaurant. The restaurant is hip and fun. Being a fan of his show, I knew I had to try the famous beef wellington that he talks about in his show. It lived up to my expectations and more. It was moist, buttery,and melt in your mouth perfection while bf got the rib eye steak. We went all out and ended up ordering the bone marrow and foi grais as well. Even though it was good, I don't think I'll ever end up getting this combination of food again because it was reallly really heavy as the food is already rich and hearty. . . For dessert, we got the sticky toffee pudding. Again, this was decadent and rich and I think I hurt my stomach trying to finish everything but it was just too good to stop eating. I literally could have gone to the hospital that day from overeating!
Really cool decor! The bar tube and neon were cool! The only negative was that It was very noisy (loud music). The 4 choices of bread (Wow) each one was delicious! Beet Salad (Fantastic selection of beets and Gorgonzola cheese) and Beef Wellington (Great) with Truffle Mac n Cheese (Great) and a Bone Marrow sauce (Good) - Pricey, but that's expected - overall a great restaurant!
Me and my boyfriend had reservations here on a Friday night. We got there a little early and waited about 5 min for our table but were seated at a small table in the entry dinning room while we waited. We were seated and ordered our dinner. I ordered the classic Beef Wellington and my boyfriend order the Fisherman's Grill. We also ordered the Kurobuta Pork Belly appetizer. The appetizer was wonderful. Our entrees were also wonderful. The Bread plate appetizer was full of flavor. The dinner was very filling. We had no room for dessert. The staff were very informative of the menu and very kind. We would definitely go back if we go to Vegas any time soon.
Wow!!! I may never be able to eat regular food again.  Have the toffee pudding for dessert!!!!   It was to die for. The only thing that could have made it better would be if Ramsey was there!
