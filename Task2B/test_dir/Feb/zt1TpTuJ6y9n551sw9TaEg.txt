Never in my life have I gone to a buffet, ate something so good, I paused from eating. That's how good the food was. Everything was so delicious, the cheesecake was unbelievable, and the waiter and waitress's were very nice. The price is a bit expensive but what so you expect, it's Las Vegas. I believe the quality of food makes up for the price. It's one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. If I find myself in Las Vegas again, I'll make it a priority to eat there everyday for lunch
The room is gorgeous.  The food is extremely varied and everything we ate was pretty damn good.  That being said, I was a bit disappointed in the sushi selection, which consisted entirely of about three rolls and one salmon sushi.  The rolls were very basic and were mostly rice.   I would focus on the meats, salads and seafood (ceviche, poke, crab legs).   If you like tapas-type dishes, you will like this buffet.  The desserts, by the way, were incredible, so leave some room!
I used to come here when opened at first. I didnt come here.for about 2 year but one of friends want to try buffet so i came here to try.. . Service is decent as always and their atmosphere is nice. However i dissappointed to food taste.. almost everything is salty and some of food is not taste right.. . . it was way better before.  . . . Dessets are always good!
Had to wait a fair while in line to pay and then again to be seated, but at least we knew that coming in.. . Lots of varieties of food and it was all fresh. All the food I had was of a good quality and definitely leaps and bounds above the cheap buffets you might know from elsewhere.. . I enjoyed everything I ate and definitely loved the enormous dessert area.
The presentation is gorgeous. The food always looks amazing. The best is the garlic mashed potatoes. They really don't look like much, but they are literally out of this world. . . ADVICE: There are 2 lines. One line to pay and one line to actually get seated. If the line to get seated is long, have someone from your group stand in that line (make sure they pay you for their meal, unless you're like a baller or something) and those standing in the line to pay will just pay for the person who is holding down the fort in the seating line. Join your friend in the seating line when you've all paid. Best way to get in faster if there is a huge line. (if this was confusing, just message me)
I wasn't super impressed by this buffet. It was a nice price but I've been spoiled by Bacchanal. . . Not as much variety, nor am I impressed by the quality. . . Just okay.
The selection is great but could have used some higher quality items given the price tag. Service is efficient and I never returned to my table that had not been cleared already. The seafood portions were very small and the oriental / Asian section mediocre.. Even on a slow day, expect a line to get in. However all said and done, a buffet worth trying!
This buffet has seen better days. For the price you pay at dinner ($51 with tax and tip), you can get a much better meal elsewhere.  The selection of food was not as expansive, nor as impressive, as the first time I came here several years ago. Unfortunately, new is king on the Strip and Bacchanal is slaying (for a price, of course). I also like Studio B if you want to drive south.  Bellagio, Wynn, and Paris were previous greats for me, but they don't even come to mind when I think of Vegas buffet options anymore. Adding Cosmo to that list.
This is not your average daggy buffet, with pizzas and pastas and junk. This place was no joke. They had everything in personalised portions with such a huge variety of food choices. There was no way we could try it all. From the custom Mac and Cheese bar, to risotto, to scallops, prawn cocktails, roast meat section, Korean BBQ section, make your own Ramen noodles, Sushi and not to mention the amazing desserts. There was endless choice and all the food was fresh and tasty. The service was not the greatest but not a turn off either. I will definitely go back and recommend to anyone if you are in the Cosmo it's worth a try.
The hype is real, but for a $34 brunch meal, I expect much more.. . Wicked Spoon stands out from other Vegas buffets for two things-the beautiful presentation & extraordinary dessert bar. . . FOOD:. (Pros). -Small portions in fancy bowls and dishes. This means you'll have more room to try other items.. -They have fresh juice! Their own veggie & fruit mix-I literally stacked 10 cups on my table hoping they wouldn't judge me lol. -Eggs benedict are a must!. . (Cons). -Expect to only fit 3 items at a time. Plates get overly crowded with individual dishes.. -Minus one star, because...NO SEAFOOD SECTION :( . . DESSERT:. Holy crap! Amazing dessert options. From chocolate covered strawberries to Italian gelato icecream, to Latin panna cotta and lavish cheesecakes. . . SERVICE:. Our server was on it! Seriously, she came by every few minutes to take our plates, refill our water and offer more drinks. I loved her!. . Like any Vegas buffet, expect a long wait.
Not for me.  Pictures on Yelp are very appealing, but taste and quality of food did not match their appearance.  Highlights for me were wicked chicken wings and watermelon salad.  Meat (bacon and prime rib) slices were 80% fat.  I am all for marbling in my meat, but come on.  Shrimp we're also overcooked and mush inside.  Desserts were more pretty than good.  Dessert attendant also had some questionable hygiene practices when dishing out ice cream with only gloved hand.  Sat near ice cream cooler so witnessed this several times.  Had always thought I had never really ate at the right buffet in Vegas to find one I liked, but I thought this to be a higher end and after my forth different one...I am still disappointed.  Done with buffets in Vegas.
I'm not a buffet person but this is one of my fave buffets! It's clean and the menu is extensive. From Salads, meats, mac 'n cheese, pastas, sushi, eggs Benedict, noodle dishes, seafood and to a beautiful array of desserts! The chocolate covered strawberries are amazing! I understand they like to serve in quaint dishes but it's annoying especially if you want to eat more than the serving they've pre-carved for you. Service is good. Keep in mind this place shuts down between 2pm to 5pm. So if you arrive at 1:45pm (like I did), there's no line, but you gotta eat fast! Def check this place out!
Normally this is one of our favorite buffets, but tonight's dinner left us somewhat disappointed.  It wasn't super busy at all, and with Chinese New Year theme they had more than usual Asian Dishes. Our server, Britney, was excellent as were the desserts ( I love those mini chocolate mousse cones!).  The entrees however missed several notes:. . - Many of the dishes were way over seasoned this time: Korean Galbi, mushroom risotto, and cocktail shrimp.. . - The roasted pork belly was cut into huge chunks, like a ball of pure fat.  It's supposed to be a layer of meat, fat, and crispy skin, but here it was nearly all fat!. . - Sushi options were limited, and the snapper nigiri had cold, hard rice.. . There were a few bright spots: octopus salad was tender and had good acidity, kale salad and collard greens were good, and the lamb and prime rib were both juicy and flavorful.. . We may need to take a break from Wicked Spoon to try out a few other places.  They may have had an off night or like in casino gaming maybe we just picked the wrong dishes :(
For the price we paid this place was quite terrible. I have no idea why it has so many high reviews. I was really disappointed.
After trying many buffet places in Vegas, We wanted to go check the best one and found this recommended by many online sites to be the best buffet in Vegas which It was NOT....First, It was expensive than the other buffets around...Second, The variety of food was not that great....No doubt that the presentation of the food was really good but the food lacked taste. There were a lot of healthy food choices and portion controlled servings but If you want to eat healthy, Buffet is not a good place to go...I like their small juice samples and nutty yogurt that was in the salad counter. Beef steaks were Horrible. Desert bar was awesome....Service was Alright too...
This was my very first buffet after being married with my husband, and I have to say, that this is hands down the best buffet I have ever had.. . Every single dish was so fresh and flavorful, you can't go wrong with anything here. The service here was phenomenal! Even the person who ran the place asked us how we were doing, and it felt good. He was very nice, and so was our waiter.. . I don't eat much but I wanted to try every single item, and I did. From the breakfast, to the lunch items every single dish was spot on! The desserts were ridiculously good! So yummy can't wait to go back to vegas next year and try it again.. . I would highly recommend this buffet if anyone wants good food while in Las Vegas. Also I would recommend to go during brunch time, that's when I went and it was amazing!
The Wicked Spoon was utterly a complete joke!!! The food selection was very scarce...there was absolutely no taste in anything that I tried...the workers were very dry and rude. The lady at the gelatto station was extremely annoyed because I was asking her about the flavors, the guy at the pizza station glared at me because I didn't put the tongs back in its place...well there was no plate for me to place the tongs on...I didn't want to just leave it on the counter! Oh and the sushi rolls was so dry that it looked like it had been sitting out for hours. I regret taking my Sister here for her 50th Birthday! Sorry but Never again will I support this buffet!!!
There is nothing that I can say negative about this place. It is a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for good food. The service was excellent. I have been here a few times since it opened, but only for brunch. The choices of food are extremely varied. Today I tried the red velvet pancakes. They were just ok actually. The French toast was delicious. The fried chicken was crisp, moist and seasoned to perfection. The home cured bacon looked like nothing but a slab offat, but it was OMG delicious, although I'm sure it was a heart attack waiting to happen. lol. The salmon eggs benedict was soooo good. The collard greens were PERFECT. The Korean spicey rice cake was so spicey, yet so very good. I had more before the dessert, but I can't remember what I had. For desert, I had cheesecake, carrot cake, peanut butter blondie, apple crisp and vanilla ice cream. There can't be another buffet in town with desserts better than the ones here. To go along with that, the bottomless mimosas and coffee were oh, so good. My frieds said that that the bloody mary's were awesome. MY friends had never been and really enjoyed it and agreed that we would go again in six months. I can only do one or two buffets a year. I was not able to eat dinner tonight because I'm still full from brunch. It was worth it.
i love their congee rice porridge..One of the best i have so far very surprising.
The ONLY buffet I will go to. It was AMAZING!! The best beef short ribs I've ever tried. Everything is done with creativity and taste. I loovvee the dessert. The only issue with me is paying to get in and I only eat a little bit if food :/ I get full so fast. It's sooooo worth it though. I suggest you go there on an empty stomach and when you aren't about to show your stomach off :p Enjoy
I have been to ALL the casino buffets in Las Vegas. This is by far the BEST buffet in Vegas.. . The attention to detail on some food items are extraordinary. The crab legs are sliced and evenly placed in small porcelain cups, along with other items such as Korean food. Every single item was fresh and had the best taste.. . The wait time is not long. Dessert is extraordinary.
Don't get me wrong the presentation of the food was adorable and the appearance of the buffet itself was really pretty. I just can't get over the fact that it costs so much and the food wasn't as fantastic as everyone claims it to be. I have definitely had way better food elsewhere in Vegas, but at least I could say I tried it once.
One of the most talked about buffets Ive heard so I had to go. Food was wonderful...except, their crab legs were FROZEN & I had to eat it like ice cubes. I had to melt it in my mouth!!! I thought i just got the bad batch so i waited for them to reload, & again, FAIL!! Completely frozen crab legs!!! WTH?!! What a waste-I literally had to roll the crab meat in my mouth until it was edible. Who eats crab meat like that?!!. . On the bright side. Some of my fav's were. 1. Salad bar was WONDERFUL!!. Beet salad & Cranberry Kale salad YUM. Shrimp & Scallop shooters Oh YES!!. 2. Pork loin was heavenly, fat was great!!!. 3. Collard greens- mmm'MM!!!. 4. Dessert bar was simply sweet. 5. I think i drank fresh squeezed grapefruit & OJ & then coffee with desserts!!. . . . . Crab legs were ultimate FAIL!!. 4.
I paid $88 for my girlfriend and I. I must say that if you're a Vegan (my girlfriend happens to be a vegan), then you're out of luck. She literally ate kale, and a tangerine. There's really not that much to eat except Kale. Not her fault though, just not that great of a selection for vegans.. . However, if you're like me who eats pretty much anything then it's totally worth it! The quality of the meat is top notch, and the design of the food tops it off. What I mean by design is that these chefs make the food look all pretty and what not.
Wicked Spoon is one of my top favorite buffets I have been to. The food is great, good service, and nice decoration. . . The food was so good and everything was beautifully presented. I almost wanted to have more room in my stomach to try more stuff lol. Everything that I pick was so good. My friends and I went during brunch and was so hungry and ready to eat it all lol. Our waitress was nice, fast, and helpful. The desserts looked so beautiful and were all very yummy. . . It was my first time coming to Wicked Spoon and I was very satisfied. If you love buffets I highly recommend you try this one.
one of the nicest buffets ive ever been to. price is reasonable for the fabulous selection of foods and desserts that they offer. i like how the items are all seperated in their own individual dishes and they also have a mac & cheese bar where you can choose your own ingredients...and it was Delish!! i definately recommend this place and i will come back here when i am visiting Vegas!!!
Well it is no wonder why it is highly rated. This was the nicest buffet I have ever been to. So many different choices. Every bit of food is beautifully plated and tastes wonderful. There's an asian bar, gelato, sushi and so many other options. We went for brunch and I wanted to try everything! Had it not been so early, I would have, but something about sushi so early is not appetizing to me. Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, plenty of things to choose from. . Oh, and if you're a platinum Marriott rewards member, you get to use the shorter line. We didn't know that, but thankfully the regular line wasn't long.
I'm hooked. Go for brunch its a good deal! :)
Very disappointing!!! Overly priced and very poor quality food! :(. Came here after reading the reviews but feel let down.
I came here yesterday...i read reviews from yelp and saw many ppl give this restaurant positive reviews, so I wanted give a try..or I usially go to Bacchanal which at Cesar for dinner. I paid 80+ for my gf and I, but I felt dissapointed...first I had a bowl of miso soup....i feel salty....seriously....self-made mac&cheese is ok, and lamb is good...also my gf said their chinese dishes ( fried rice and spicy rice cake) were not bad....however, most cuisine are salty...hope they make some changes...plz reconsider cost down for dinner if they dont want to change cuisine style......
loved this place until today when I realized it's heading towards average. the meats at the meat station looked like they were a few days old, selection of pre-made little dishes were very limited, and their famous mac and cheese looked old and average. no rolls for breakfast for the exception of sliced bread next to the toaster. what happened since last year???. . not a favorite anymore. should have tried another buffet because this one has seen better days.
This is the single best buffet I have had the pleasure of coming to. Literally everything is delicious here. The food is well prepared, and has a culinary range not only across the traditional time-groups of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but also across every stage of a multi-course meal. The ambience is perfectly in line with the rest of the hotel and casino (The Cosmopolitan), and the presentation is both upscale and relaxing. The service is courteous and attentive, especially for a buffet. The one drawback is that the price is ~$40 per person and there's typically a 30 minute wait, but the treasure at the end is bountiful and satisfying. Overall, a delightful experience and a Vegas must.
Never been much of buffet person too begin with but had friends visiting in town and they had some comps wanted too try Wicked Spoon. Why not! I noticed that it had strong ratings and know its more fancier buffet or upscale strip buffet. The location is interesting because not on the casino floor of the Cosmo but on the second floor so takes some work too find it. Once you get there thinking is this really buffet because the interior screams nothing of the type. The tables not your typical all sane size two or fours or connect bunch of tables together. You have nice couch type of four tops, even have bar stool long tables, wine self service machine (least that what I could gather since non of us drank wine that night), and really nice vibe too it.. . The food was hit or miss. There were few good things but also for all the good felt like just as much bad. The fried rice pretty much bland but like the presentation in the little chinese to go box. The yakisoba noodles were awesome. Most of the cold seafood apps was fan of from the tako salad, shrimp ceviche, shrimp with grits, and caesar salad. The craving station not fan of the pork belly (the pieces were huge chunks: besides no one at the craving station), the kalbi short ribs were just flat out fatty pieces and gross, never tried the prime rib but looked okay, and might have had something else. I enjoyed the tacos lot between the pulled pork and chicken had go back twice just for more tacos. The fresh salsa and guacamole was good. The jalapeno cornbread was tasty had too get seconds on that one. I do like the diversity with the menu between the three different areas. Dessert area that one that nothing but HIT after HIT. The gelatos, too the petite fours of rice krispies bars, macrons, and every other little dessert delight could think of they had out. So make sure you leave room for desserts when you come too Wicked Spoon. . . This whole little sauce puts and tapa style plates. Too be fair not all of the food small portions. NOT FAN. I love the look too it! No doubt keeps you from going buffet excess cause in reality no way can fit as much on plate. But really after the second trip gets irritating so I just double stacking pots or plates save trip. . . The service unfortunately hate too be mean but our waitress literally forgot what we order for drinks had too come back twice too make sure got it right. She took long time too get our drinks. Half the time notice she was talking too group at another table and not really playing attention too other guests. Our glasses always empty and not on it came too clearing out dirty plates. Bad service. . . In closing say that maybe cause not fan of buffets in general. The amount of money paying would much rather go non buffet enjoy quality food then quantity.
Terrible service! After paying I was seated rather quickly but it went down hill after that. The waitress didn't acknowledged that we even needed service until I complained about it 25 minutes later. She was avoiding our table and the one next to us. After we complained she finally came over to act friendly because her boss heard about it. . . While the entire length of the non - service she never asked us what we would like to drink or even greeted us. The only common denominator was that we and the table next to us were not white. She seemed to be serving all the white people in her area non stop the whole time. I felt embarrassed and frustrated that I had to complain to a manager and nothing changed even then. Food was okay and lacking in variety but decent. . . Price was not worth the aggravation.  We left after eating without being asked if we wanted a drink the entire service. I will never go to this buffet ever again. I also will not recommend this to the many friends that visit Las Vegas. We weren't the only ones that experienced this racist waitress. Avoid this like the plague. White people only. Sorry but that's how everyone in her area that wasn't white felt like. Three other groups also as we were leaving had no service.. . Shitty Valentines day!
Great decor, great food, one of the best buffets I've been too aside from the buffet at the Wynn, def recommend coming here!
I've heard many people talk about this buffet as being one of the best in Vegas. I live in Vegas so I've tried many buffets. I love the Cosmo. It's a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms right in the middle of the strip. I have to say I was really, really disappointed in the buffet. We went today for Sunday brunch. My partner got a comp but we didn't realize that because it's a holiday weekend their prices were almost double the normal price. My fault. As a Vegas resident, I should have known better. We expected to pay about $25-$30 per person but it was $39.99 so we ended up paying over $50 out of pocket. in addition, even a comped meal doesn't get you ahead of the long line waiting to get in. You have to be a VIP of their casino club for that . Okay, our mistake on the cost. After waiting endlessly in line, I was sure that it would be worth the wait. Being a "holiday" buffet, should mean some really good food choices.Their gimmick here is small tasting portions in little bowls, pans, and pots. I like that idea but many of the items were weird combinations that didn't look or sound appetizing to me. I love breakfast buffets because I can have a little of a lot of breakfast foods. I love french toast but it was mushy and inedible. There were red velvet pancakes that had a good taste with a bavarian creme to put on top but maybe because they were so thin and small, they were kind of hard so I didn't get more than one. Also the Bavarian creme container was almost empty and my second time around had not yet been refilled. There didn't seem to be anything normal there. No regular pancakes. Eggs Benedict? No, a salmon Benedict and a beef Benedict but no regular Canadian bacon Benedict. Angry mac and cheese (spicy - didn't like), wasabi mashed potatoes (again, not to my liking), spaghetti but with scallops and weird looking noodles. The pork loin was bland. The homemade Italian sausage at the carving station was pink inside (yuck). There was a whole section of Asian food - sushi and Chinese dishes. Not my favorite so I can't comment but one of my companions loves sushi and wasn't impressed. No Mexican fare. For the price we paid, I was sure there would be crab legs or shrimp entrees. Nope. Nothing that really justified the $40 price tag IMO. They had shrimp cocktail in small tasting cups so if shrimp is your thing, you'd need to take a lot of cups. I'm a dessert-a-holic so when the meal wasn't that great, I still had hopes for the desserts. I was disappointed there as well. The cakes were dried out and just okay. There was a pistachio cake, carrot cake, chocolate bundt, and cheese cake. A chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce on the bottom didn't have a liquid chocolatey middle like most lava cakes I've had. There were some danishes - strawberry and Nutella, and cookies and tarts. The best were the chocolate covered strawberries. They were large and covered in chocolate and either Heath bar pieces or Oreo crumbs. The desserts weren't bad but they weren't outstanding either. After waiting a long time to go to this place, and spending the equivalent of $120, the best thing I can say is that now that I've been there, I'll never be tempted to go again.
Worse high end buffet I've ever been to! Sat down & no service for 20mins. When finally got drinks ordered it was delivered wrong! Plates were not cleared during our entire dinner service! Food was terrible on top of all that. $140 for 2 adults & 2 kids...what a waste. Caesar's Bachannal much better.
My bestriend and I decided to try this place for valentines day. Since I've never been here and it's a new casino and search it on yelp the pictures looks like theirs a lot of good variety of food so we decided to try it. When we got there yes theirs no line on a Sunday, which was good. We paid $100 plus tax for me and my bestfriend. So we were thinking this place must be good for the price. Nope! We were hella disappointed! The host gave us a table next to the staff kitchen. Were we hear employees complaining about their jobs and dropping utensils and doesn't pick them up until someonelse is not lazy enough to pick it up. Lazy staff! We were so hungry but we wanted to wait till our server tony comes to get our drinks! He finally came, so my bestfriend and I finally got up to get some. Omg!!!! This buffet is so small! Nothing like yelp pictures says. They shouldn't be posting pictures like that because they do not serve nothing like that. The food sucks! They didn't even have fries, no steam rice or better rice to choose from, no hot sauces to choose, no BBQ ribs, the food looks dried out and plain and no taste at all! I was hella disappointed! My friend and I were getting mad already because we paid $100 something for this buffet and top of that our server never came to refill our drinks! I'm a nice girl but sorry I had to complain to the manager! Because we paid so much for the food and the food sucks or less food and bad service!! Buffet Asia and rio is wayyyyyyyyy wayyyy better than this!! We will never go back and would not recommended it!!!! If you reading this review trust me this place sucks!!!! It's so expensive and less food, the food sucks and bad service! To oily and some meat aren't cook right. I think Panda Express food is way better than this. That's how bad it is!!!
To be honest, I don't really care for the food here. Though, I do love that they have chocolate covered strawberries in their dessert station. The food is just subpar. Like, I personally haven't found anything to really like here. I've been here for brunch and dinner so far. The food has no allure but there's just something about it that compels me to like it, sort of, haha.. . A glass of wine is $8. The interior is very nice looking and it's quite spacious, too. There aren't many stations (at least, it doesn't feel like it) but I guess it suffices in its own way. I don't eat much anyway so I don't care. But with the food that they do have, the quality isn't very appetizing :/.. . Overall, it's just so-so with a certain appeal.
I love this place!! Sunday brunch was pure delight. I was in foodie heaven. Bottomless mimosas..red velvet pancakes..great salads..seafood was amazing..oh man and chocolate covered strawberries with homemade gelato!!!!! Yes I want more please
my favorite buffet in las vegas.. . after so many trips to vegas and being able to sample all of the buffets (either over time and/or via the Buffet of Buffets 24hr pass), there are a few reasons why Wicked Spoon is my favorite.. . the price is right up there with the costs of eating at the other premiere buffets on the Strip (the Rio, the Bacchanal, the Bellagio) but considering the many different varieties of entrees and desserts, it's the best bang for your buck. the kicker is that for $10 extra during brunch, you can add bottomless mimosas, bloody mary's, and champagne which more than pays for itself after you've had a couple to go along with your meal. it's a good way to sit back and welcome the afternoon with friends!. . aside from your standard buffet must have's like the prime rib, roast beef, crab legs, and short ribs. but they also have dishes that are a nice twist and a treat considering i don't get to eat that way often like the goat cheese mac & cheese, oysters, crab cakes, and bone marrow. the desserts are delicious: gelato, thai tea ice cream, pastries, cake pops, and pecan tarts highlight the dessert section if you want a step up from the usual apple pie, cookies, or jello.. . by comparison, the new Bacchanal at the Caesar's Palace is great, but not "worth paying almost $20 more than what you'd pay at WS" great. they also take part in the Buffet of Buffets pass, but to dine there, you have to pay an additional $15 (after you've already paid $50 for the pass itself). and when i ate there a few months ago, i didn't see any dishes that weren't served at WS that would justify the difference in price. enjoy!. . -civilities.
Never cared to review Vegas buffet's because the majority of the time they're roughly the same.  . . Went to Wicked Spoon and tried almost every dish my little tummy could hold, but almost everything was terrible!  Left very disappointed, better off sticking with one of the classic buffets where you know you're going to get solid quality food and leave very full. Not worth the hype or the $ at all.
My experience at Wicked Spoon was simply, A-OK.. . I'm gonna tell you this before you continue on reading.....BACCHANAL at Caesars Palace is sooooooo much better. More variety, better quality, better presentation. Did I already mention more variety!??!? Bacchanal felt like a never ending choice of items and yet....Wicked Spoon didn't have much. . My friend and I went on a weekday for lunch. $26.99 per person. . He was visiting from out of town so we were deciding between Bacchanal or this. It was the pictures posted here that swayed us to go to Wicked Spoon. Everything looked good and there SEEMED like a lot of variety available.. . This is why I took off another star. Lunch schedule is from 11am-2pm. Then they close the entire buffet for a few hours and then they start dinner at 5pm. Ummm...hello!?!!! This is Las Vegas!!! Since when do people/tourists ever eat on time!?! People are drunk and hungover on odd hours of the day and they choose to close the buffet!?!? Come on now.. . Don't get mistaken...it's not a bad place to eat. Food quality was fine. I give it a solid B. I just wished for more variety like how Bacchanal has. Both buffets I went during lunch time. So for those of you who tried Bacchanal already...you might be disappointed with Wicked Spoon.
We came here on recommendation from a hotel employee. Stories of fresh made sushi and other things. Rated #1 in Vegas he said. Not the typical buffet we heard.. . Waited 10 mins to be seated, not bad. The atmosphere was beautiful. The staff was friendly for the most part, except for the seafood chef who confronted a guest for accidentally dropping food on some plates. . . The sushi was not freshly made in front of us, it was a bit dried out. So I moved on to the crab legs, which I had very high hopes for. Unfortunately I was disappointed by those as well. The crab legs tasted as if they had been thawed in a puddle of cold water and left there to soak it up.. . Things we did like : cauliflower mash, made to order Mac n cheese, selections of meats and cheeses, dessert bar.. . Would I go back, nah. Not worth it.
Heard a lot of fascinating things about this buffet and finally made it to Vegas to try it..  . $38 per person . Wednesday night. Water was good. I liked that there were varieties of food and that most items were already pre portioned in individual containers .  The dessert table was beautiful. The sorbets  and gelato are a must try. Service was great. . . I thought that the whole buffet was too hyped up. I wasn't too please with the lack of flavors in majority of the items I tasted. . For example, how do you mess up a taco? The tortilla wasn't cooked all the way. There was a lot of flavorless food.  I felt hungry still after because a lot of the food were too bland to finish. Sorbets were good. I love a good simple chocolate chip cookie but the one here was not good enough for me to eat one on the way out. . It definitely wasn't worth the $38 . . . I really wanted to love this place. I'm glad I got the chance to try this buffetthough.
Very disappointed with this buffet.. Very limited choices and the dessert does not taste as good as it looks.. Will definitely not recommend anyone to go here for buffet.
Probably the only thing they had going for them was the make your own mac and cheese station!!  It was delicious but other than that nothing else tasted any good.  The crab legs were sooooo tiny.  They did have a good taste but not big enough to keep going back and back and back again.  Desserts were not good either.  They were mostly very dry or no taste to them.  Would I go back umm. . . No.  I would only go to the Bellagio buffet if I ever even think about coming to Las Vegas ever again.
I saw a lot of good reviews and thought I checked it out.  I was quite disappointed.   The crab legs were small and soggy.  I thought there'd be more food selections.  The serving areas were dirty and didn't see anyone cleaning them.  With that high of a price, I thought there would be more seafood selections; good thing we had coupons for buy 1 get 1 off...still not worth the 1/2 price.  The brunch Buffet at the Wynn was better for cheaper.
Lots of variety of choices for $40 on a weekend. I thought that the presentation on the food was nice, but it did make it difficult to grab a variety of food on your plate. Had to go up multiple times. Most of the dishes were flavorful. I was really disappointed with the crab legs though. My boyfriend and I really enjoy crab legs and was excited that Wicked Spoon had it on their buffet. The crab legs, however, were sliced so thin and way over cooked. When I was picking out the crab meat from the shell, I would only grab enough to nibble on since they were cut so thin. Also, did not like our waiter. He was just so flustered and not friendly. He also took forever to remove our used plates. Overall, I probably won't return to this place when I go back to Vegas. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.
Best buffet ever... That is saying a lot too because not a real big fan of buffets to begin with. Food good. Gelato best had especially salted peanut caramel. Salmon n pork with crispy skin was good. The only bummer is they close early.
This is a direct comparison to other Las Vegas buffets and their food definitely falls in the top 3 of best of Vegas buffets. (See also The Buffet in Wynn and Bacchanal in Caesar's Palace). Keep in mind it is a buffet and you will find much better executed food at actual restaurants. . . The wait can be a bit extreme during weekends and especially during peak times of the year. When in Rome, or Vegas, I prefer to save my buffet days to a day when I feel it won't be as crowded so I haven't experienced a crowd much much but even if I had to, I'd wait here. It's worth the experience, even if you try this place at least once. . . There are many great places to eat in Vegas, much better than even this buffet, so if you're not looking to gorge yourself, then maybe bust out that Yelp app. . . What makes this buffet stand out are the individual dishes here that I prefer over other buffets that may have a bit more selection. Duck confit ravioli, KBBQ ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here. Many of their dishes are served in individual containers so it's interesting. . . I do feel there is a strong difference in quality, execution and variety of dishes you'll find here throughout the year. When I went in January, it wasn't memorable, and definitely not the place I've hyped up to some people. During Summer, it's so busy but you'll still find days in the week where the line won't be as long as the weekends and there are more food options. . . As for dessert, they have better desserts elsewhere, but their Gelato is made in house and the flavors are unique. . . If you're looking for many types of different cuisine and a wide assortment of dishes within that type of food or cuisine, you're better off going to Bacchanal.
In 5 days, I went here and to the Bacchanal. Wicked Spoon is a very close 2nd to Baccahanal. And I mean close. . . If the Bacchanal is a 2014 Bentley, then Wicked Spoon is a 2013. That's how close it is.. . Wicked Spoon has the edge over Bacchanal in Asian food and meats. Bacchanal takes the win for desserts, salad, bread, and Italian.. . Short story, it's amazing.
Most amazing buffet by far, Ever. Must visit every trip to VEGAS. Samira is the best server. Will come back and will tell everyone about this place
Best Buffet in Vegas by far!! We came here only for breakfast but the food was exceptional. Everything from the salad to the pastries was very fresh and they have a huge selection for you to choose from. Make sure you leave a huge space for desert because this is the best part- from mini molten chocolate cakes to gelato to chocolate dipped strawberries it's really desert heaven!
Absolutely scrumptious! From the eggs benedict to the gelato. Yum! Stuffed ourselves silly on gourmet fare. Sushi, meat carving station, salmon, roasted brussel sprouts...mmm. They have everyrhing to satisfyboth sweet & savory appetites. The only thing i didn't care forwas the rissoto.. Get the bottomless champagne too. Totally worth it!
So this was a total waste of time. After all the raving I'd heard about this buffet and a family member's recommendation...I decided to make my way with my mom to try out this buffet. My naivety made me think that the Cosmo, being a proponent for the alternative lifestyle would cater somewhat to a vegetarian. So I paid ~$28 per person for a brunch buffet. . . Let me preface the rest of this review by saying that if I only had 2 dishes to sample and they were of excellent quality...I'd keep my mouth shut. I had a large number of dishes to sample...none of them inventive, none of them delicious and none of them memorable in any way. The salads were bleh...there was a greek salad, kale salad, oven-dried tomatoes, caprese and beet salad. ALL of which did not entice seconds (considering I couldn't even palate the one tablespoon of each salad I took). The angry mac and cheese was shells, velvet and some hot sauce. Although purportedly vegetarian, I spied a few bowls of them with bacon bits. Not cool.. . There was the usual Italian fare...gnocchi with a basil tomato and black garlic sauce (average), sweet pea risotto (horrible) and cheese pizza (how uninteresting). The Asian section had chicken powder/stock in everything. I was told by one chef that the udon was vegetarian...then another one said, no it was not. I gave up and didn't even try it. I asked if they could make me a simple vegetable roll with soy paper but low and behold...the sushi they get is prepackaged and bought from some conglomerate like Sysco. Cosmo...weren't you supposed to be different and awe-inspiring?. . The bread offered was BAGELS (like two types) and there were three types of sad cheeses on the charcuterie. Pathetic. The only thing I had with some glee was the red velvet pancake.The chocolate covered strawberries was a nice touch but the rest of the desserts not too good. They do have a pretty legit gelato bar if that's your scene. . . I had about $5 worth of food. My mom is pissed off at a bad lunch and I'm seething with anger at the absolute blasphemy that is Wicked Spoon. Wynn, Bachannal and Bellagio are way better that this crap. In other news, service was OK and the decor was as if I was in a conference room.. . Avoid.
Wickedly good!  Not your Vegas everyday Buffet.  We liked the variety and unique dishes! Went on a Monday for "Brunch" at around 11.  No wait.  Interesting variety like, salmon eggs Benedict.  Omelet's freshly prepared.  Apple and maple sausage. Spicy Mac and cheese. Kale salad. Pork belly. Sushi. Shrimp. Korean style ribs. Loved the small individual servings for many dishes. Fantastic desert offerings....including sugar free chocolate moose!  Who else does that?   Nice modernistic dining setting with flat screen tv monitors displaying informative definitions of different food types and ingredients.  Priced moderately for a strip hotel but you can use your players card and apply a discount to the bill.  Overall...very impressed and we recommended!
I thought most all the food was awful. Definitely not worth the money. Much of it tasted over salted or just not fresh...like it was sitting out too long. Would definitely not go back.
Finally got the chance to eat at Wicked Spoon after hearing many good things about it. Usually when I come to Vegas, I always eat at Bachannal inside Caesar's Palace. However, we decided differently this time around. In the plus side, this buffet is more on the inexpensive side compared to other Vegas buffets. For the price, the food is definitely worth it; around $43! . . I really enjoyed the cute Chinese boxes they had with udon noodles, mixed veggies, etc. They added a unique touch to the typical buffet feel. Included a wide variety of food. Lots of small, individually prepared dishes; just like the ones at Bachannal, as well. Since it was Sunday, their brunch items stayed out until 3, so it was nice to have breakfast too. Who doesn't love super crispy bacon for lunch? Or anytime of the day for that matter! Their freshly squeezed juice or "wicked juice" we're poured into shot sized glasses and was really yummy. . . Our waitress was nice and made suggestions on which foods to try because it was unique to their particular buffet. But, you could tell she was really preoccupied with other tables and how busy it was. The good thing was, other waiters and waitresses would constantly ask if we needed refills or if we needed any help. . . The price also includes gratuity so it was one less thing to worry about after we were finished eating. Definitely will add Wicked Spoon to one of my go to buffets in Vegas
I was dying to go here after seeing such great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. I had started to second-guess the decision after reading some recent less-than-favorable reviews, but decided to go for it since I had been looking forward to it for so long. It ended up being the best buffet I have ever been to. The food was much higher quality than traditional buffets and stood out in terms of presentation. Their menu seems to rotate, so I won't go into their offerings, but just know that it's worth the price and you won't be disappointed.
PROS:. . - dessert bar is a MUST! From chocolate-dipped strawberries to French macarons to Italian gelato (specifically Thai tea, pistachio and salty caramel!)...ooohhh yeaaa =). - during brunch they have a 'make-your-own-omelette station'. - during dinner they have a 'make-your-own-mac-n-cheese station'. - the bf swears by the bone marrow!. - many of the dishes change frequently. - attentive service. Never had an empty glass and our plates never piled up on the table. - the red meats at the carving station were always moist and juicy. - many of the dishes were displayed in pre-portioned little frying baskets, pots, pans and even take-out boxes. Easy to just grab-n-go. Such cute presentations. - the salad/breakfast/bread/cheese bar is essential. Smoked salmon with cream cheese on a toasted bagel was perfection. Their juice shots were refreshingly sweet. Frequented that area a lot. - fried chicken wings were crisp and juicy. - delicious Korean short ribs. - very clean, organized and spacious. . . CONS:. . - EXPENSIVE. Lunch is about $40/person and dinner is a hefty $50/person!. - since most of the dishes are in little pots and pans you can only fit so much on a plate. - just walk by the Asian section--you're not missing out here. - lacking a soup selection or maybe I just couldn't find it. - frozen crab legs every time I come. - pizza selection didn't look and taste fresh. - it can get very busy and crowded. The lines to get into the restaurant can get pretty ridiculous during the weekend. . I can go on and on but I think you get the gist of it. I haven't been to all the buffets in Vegas but I will say that Wicked Spoon is way better than the Rio Buffet or even Bayside at Mandalay Bay. Only problem--it's just so damn pricey. I have yet to try Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace but hopefully I can the next time I'm in town. Until then, Wicked Spoon is by far the fanciest looking buffet I've been to with some great and not-so great dishes.
$45 for dinner.. . Must eats: the mussels in wine sauce, crab legs, and bone marrow. For dessert, mango macaroons, dulce de leche cake, and chocolate cake !. . The cuts of meats were good too like prime rib. . Salad bar, soup bar, italian bar, chinese bar were ok nothing special.. . Service was ok. I had to flag waiter down for more water when our 2 bottles of water ran out.
This place sucks. =( I've already had so many friends tell me that it isn't good, but the birthday boy wanted to try this place so we do what the birthday boy says. It was so soo disappointing. There was no wait at all. They have about 7 different stations of foods and I actually tried all 7, hoping that I would like at least SOMETHING. But.... none. There was barely any seafood selections besides some crab legs which were not fresh or even close to being decent. Everything tasted soo bland. We had a party of 7 and none of us ended up liking the food. Please save your money and go somewhere else!
LOVE LOVE LOVE! And this is coming from someone who actually hates buffets. Hahaha. . . Wicked Spoon is actually one of the only buffets where I really thought it was worth the money. My husband and I came for brunch, and we enjoyed everything about this place. The ambience, the people, the set-up, AND the FOOD. . . The food was displayed adorably and everything was realllllly good. My husband LOVED that they had gelato and someone to serve you at the gelato station. LOL. So many choices in different cuisines, that I ended up eating breakfast food, and then lunch food 30 minutes later. I especially loved the omelette station, where you can choose anything you want and they make it to order. . . The staff was friendly, and it was well worth the money!
I love bringing all the out of towners to this place. It's a fun whimsical venue with a large selection of food. The dessert area is huge. Everyone I bring here always enjoys it.
