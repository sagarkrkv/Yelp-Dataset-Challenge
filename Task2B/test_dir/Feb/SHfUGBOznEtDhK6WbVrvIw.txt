So much hype,  is it worth it? I've gotten smoked meat from Schartz from friends when they came back from Montreal, always froze them and then take them out when I want to eat it by steaming it and putting it onto a toasted bagel. Really good. But since I came all the way to Montreal, decided to try a fresh made smoked meat sandwhich. It was really good and very full. Tons of meat packed in, perfectly flavored and juicy. Took another lb of meat home with me. A lb is under $14 and I think it's totally worth it. A nice treat to have once in a while.
Quand une adresse est aussi populaire il m'arrive d'etre mefiant, genre : c'est trop beau pour etre vrai. . Un essai a suffit pour me conquerir, je pense qu'il y a assez d'avis. Vous avez envie d'un sandwich a la viande fumee, ne cherchez plus. Avec un enorme cornichon a partager, pour le fun.. . Alors oui, c'est pas gastronomique, mais on n'est pas la pour ca.. . Ils font un classique, et ils le font bien, tres bien. Enough said.
Didn't expect to find a Kosher Deli in a hipster neighborhood of Montreal. It looked Proper (um...Kosher), and it was ger-jammed with noshers. It's kind of community seating, and you'd think you were on the Lower East side of NYC, save for the French being spoken.. I was hit with a stern disappointment as we were seated. They had 86'd the Half-Sour Pickled for the night. Ran Out!. DAMN! The remaining Dills were of fine quality.. The big macher here is something called "Smoked Meat", which is basically what we know as "Corned Beef" here in the states. A little coarser in texture, but very tasty.. Schwartz's is very famous for their French Fries (Frites) which look like fresh cut spuds-they have that brown on brown slightly soggy character. Not typical frites as you would get in a bistro, but closer to the fries you get in a lot of Chicago HotDog stands. For some, these are quintessential eating, alas not for me. I'm not a big French Fry fan, soggy or not.. In the long run, it was a good Deli, not a great deli. The Carnegie, this isn't. If this place was in New york, it would be run-of-the mill. For Montreal, it was fine.
Unbeatable smoked meat.  An absolutely necessary stop during any Montreal trip. The medium fat is so juicy and delicious. And if you're feeling guilty, the lean is really tasty too. The meat speaks for itself and doesn't need much more other than mustard and rye bread (or just eat it by the forkful). Easily better than any fake Montreal smoked meat places (outside of Montreal) and beats all the Montreal places too.
When you think about Smoked Meat Sandwiches, you think Schwartz's. But then you  think long lineups, Meh ambiance & a loud dining area where everything smells like Smoked Meat. That said, Schwartz's makes the best Smoked Meat sandwiches No question about it. A pound of smoked meat stacked in between rye bread with a dash of mustard. What's not to like about it. You have an option of askin for lean meat. But leaner the meat, less juicer it is, not to mention less tasty. Also get the pickle. This is a cash only establishment so make sure you are carrying cash. They do have an ATM in the back (But you end up paying 2.50 for a transaction). . . Food -  Great. Service - Ok. Ambiance - What you talkin bout Willis. Worth the money - AwwwwwYeaaaaahhhh
Great sandwiches sometimes there is the longest line I have ever seen, just for a sandwich.  It's worth it, I guess if you are from out of town, but it's boring to stand in a line alone, so bring someone to talk to so it's not so bad,  Also, instead of buying one, I buy 2.  Not because the portions being small, no they are big smoked meat sandwiches with lots of meat! It's just that they taste so good you will think about it later and wish you can taste it again, but then there is that super line.
WOW!!!! This place is definitely a must-try in Montreal. Succulent hot smoked meat sandwich on rye? Hand made fries, soda, and mac salad....about 7000 calories later I was still drooling. I want to go back here for sure! I've been to Kat'z in NYC and this place is equally as amazing at a fraction of the price. Also- go to the take out side if you're a small group- they also accept card on that side. :-B .  Go here. Now!!
really tasty food, cheap, it's as good as people say. the only thing is that it's crowded and you will have to share a table with strangers, they don't let a single seat go to waste, and as soon as you're done eating they politely kick you out, but they kind of have to otherwise the lineup would be 5 hours long
