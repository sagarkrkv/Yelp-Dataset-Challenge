Just thought i would point out Upon arrival the valet & bellman was snooty the front desk guy was also a jerk.... That gave me a weird vibe but it was late & the 4 of us girls didn't let it bother us. Our room was on the 10th floor. The rooms at hard rock are all very nice no complaints at all I've stayed in the HRH tower & the casino tower I believe that is it's name, the amount if mirrors is amazing when traveling with a group of girls. The hard rock has a fun vibe to it it's not directly on the strip but that's ok with me I think it keeps the riff raff out. I just stayed at the tropicana and wished I stayed at the hard rock :( only a $20 difference with my hard rock back stage pass. Never making that mistake again.
Had an awesome time!!! Great room great staff and it's vegas so a really good time. We will be back :)
Nothing about this hotel rises above mediocre. Rooms are aging fast and staff service is about what you'd expect  from a typical DMV. They may choose to do their job, but they definitely won't "help" in any sense of the word.. . The whole hotel is about a decade and a half past it's prime (if it ever had one). I only stayed here because it was the designated lodging for a conference at the hotel. Never again.
This is specifically regarding the HRH Tower which, I assume, is supposed to surpass the regular hard rock experience.  This is definitely a mixed bag kind of place so it averages out to about a 3 star. .  . The pluses:  inexpensive, cool decor/collectibles, good music, excellent bed, nice tub big enough for two, nice big shower, good desk service/response to requests, good wifi, easy checkout.  . . The minuses:  the Strip is too far to comfortably walk to, the suites are definitely smaller than they appear to be in the photos, the two queens suite (which one would think would be a situation where not everyone particularly wants to see everyone naked) has a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom and requires a cumbersome curtain to cover it (a curtain which blocks the door).  Additionally, the sofa could have used a shampoo, we lacked a pen and lacked a "do not disturb" sign (these were provided the next day when we requested them, but still ...) and I didn't particularly enjoy my breakfast at Mr. Lucky's. . The neutrals: casino is small/quiet, tables a little pricey but OK
I would love to give Hard Rock 5 stars but the front desk is a joke. Angel and Allison need to go back to hospitality school. When the front desk tells you the resort fees would be waived off because carpet soaked, wifi not working, crying babies next door, and rooms not ready until 5pm!!!! . . Then you go to check out and resort fees still charged to the rooms. Thanks for lying to our entire group. When we question it Angel at the front desk laughs. Very professional! . . Only front desk agent that was pleasant do deal with and actually smiled and asked how may I assist you was Mallory. Mallory you should move on to a hotel where they actually care about their guests. . . Other than the front desk staff the hotel is great from amazing restaurants and very fun nightlife. Never to crowded in the casino, probably because off the strip and smaller but nice not have to fight for a spot on a table or machine. Hard Rock has some awesome suites as well, just don't expect them to be ready until late afternoon. Even if the front desk tells you it's vacant at 1030am and will rush it. Another lie!
I enjoyed 3 nights at the Hard Rock last week. Hard Rock combines retro style with a modern playfulness that really embodies the Vegas spirit. Hard Rock is home to two concert facilities, where more than a few music legends have graced the stage, and Vegas' premier pool complex, complete with a floating bar, private cabanas and plush daybeds. . . The rooms are pretty spacious with the standard rooms clocking in at over 460 square feet. The amenities include comfortable down bedding, granite counters, sunken tubs, Bose stereos, tufted headboards and a large flat screen. The pools are beautiful. Since it was off-season, we only got to use the upper deck pool in the HRH Tower. We had the pool all to ourselves. . . There's a nice selection of restaurants, clubs and lounges on the casino level, including Pink Taco, a nice upscale sports bar (The Ainsworth), a 24-hour cafe (Mr. Lucky's) and a contemporary steakhouse (35 Steaks + Martinis). Enjoy tasty gastropub favorites and drinks at the hip Culinary Dropout. Try the pretzel bites and provolone fondue! . . There are a few downsides that I experienced while at the Hard Rock. Chief among them is the distance from the Strip. The Hard Rock is about a 15 minute walk or a short cab ride to and from the Strip ($10-12 each way). The complimentary shuttle they offer from 10am - 5pm wasn't available the 2 times we tried to use it...shuttle was full both times. We were also charged for several items from the minibar that were not used or even touched...overcharges to the tune of $65. . . I would definitely like to come to enjoy the pool complex during the warmer months. I think a private cabana is in order. We had a good time at the Hard Rock and might be back again soon.
After a couple of visits to the Hard Rock, I now know which rooms are the ones to stay in (pool-facing and HRH) and will keep that in mind to get the most out of future experiences. The Hard Rock is a really great hotel with good restaurants and shops, a great room service menu, and several nice pools. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated (total rock 'n roll theme) with contemporary bathrooms, but not as noise-blocking as some other Vegas hotels. We don't gamble, so the small casino isn't a big deal to us. The prices are super reasonable and more than make up for the distance from the strip. They do have a shuttle that goes there but it ends at 5, I believe, making it more or less pointless. I also like that it's smaller than a lot of the strip hotels, so you don't feel like you're trekking across the country just trying to get to your room. I'll definitely be back.
Ok, we switched rooms twice at HRH towers. My advice, stay away from the smoking rooms, they are tore back. All of the HRH and front staff at the main desk are awesome! They do care a lot about their guests. Remember approach determines response. Treat them well! We tipped housekeeping everyday. We love it here and our room after the second time is immaculate.  The spa is outstanding. I love it here. Oh but the WIFI sucks.
Far from the strip, casino tower was old, noisy, service was poor. Casino tower bathrooms were dated.. . I came here for a conference, and would not have otherwise. If they hold another conference there next year, I will be staying on the strip to cab it there.
Why do you have to be so far from the Strip, Hard Rock?!?!? We went to the HR to hang out with some friends who were staying there. They mostly wanted a Spa weekend so they were fine with being so far out. For us, I would love to stay there next time we are in town with the exception of the location. The decor is typical HR Cafe style. The music is great. The drinks we got while playing slots were the best quality of anywhere we went. My husband always gets Scotch on the rocks so it's hard to hide poor quality. The Pink Taco is some of the best food we had in Vegas. I say go hang out but stay somewhere closer to the Strip unless you want to spend $1 million on cabs or have to drive everywhere.
DO NOT STAY HERE!  Customer service is nonexistent.  Check in time is 3:00PM.  Do not expect to get your room at 3:00PM.  We arrived on a Sunday and were allowed to "check in" at 1:30PM and were told that we would receive a call when our room was ready.  Yup, Yeah, Right.  Didn't happen.  Went to the front desk at 3:00PM and was told that it would be an hour or so.  Once we checked in, we discovered that we were not actually going to be in the room that we were told we would be in at 1:30.  The Hard Rock is reliant on their name and and the cool memorabilia that they exhibit.  This is the second Hard Rock that we have visited in the last two months and I can honestly say that this will be the last.
Nicely designed casino, but comparatively smaller than most of the casinos on the Strip.  Since it is so far away, I kind of expected them to keep me here but I couldn't wait to leave.  Slots seem to be old with not the newer games.  Table games were cheap but limited.  Only a one table of my favorites opened.  Most of all, the decibel level were so high I couldn't hear myself think.  Ridiculous.  In fact, idiotic.  I guess young people like the music loud, but really, I needed to yell to talk to anyone.  Plus it was rap and other crappy music.  Looks like this will be my one and only trip here.
I would give this hotel 3.3 if I could. I went to HRH in September of 2013 during the weekend of the Mayweather fight so it was bumping' which is good because I just turned 21. I picked this place initially because of the price and the pool. The price was decent for a fight weekend and the pool was pretty nice, very good size with a few pools to choose from. . The only problem with the pools is the weekend when the security guards are flown in straight from Nazi Germany. My friend was not allowed in to the main pool area because her purse was literally 1cm too big for the rules. We showed the security guy we only had our phones, towels, room keys and a magazine. No dice. The women behind us had the same problem. I proceeded to make the security guard feel like a complete douche bag. I usually don't like to belittle people in public but this was a special case. If I was saying the same thing to an actual cop as I said to this fascist I would have ended up in handcuffs. It wasn't free to get into the main area either, even as hotel guests. So we settled with the quieter more family oriented pool area which was actually a little better than the main area, I think. If they were more friendly I would have given 4 stars, easily. All of the other staff non-pool related were all accommodating.. . The rooms were ok, no major complaints but I am not sure who designed the doors to the shower. They clearly didn't attend any architecture classes.... . The casino and the food are actually not bad. Pink Taco is pretty good.. .  Everyone gambling was wearing Ed Hardy and had Ed Hardy-esque tattoos. I felt a little out of place because I don't have any tattoos with huge bible quotes on my ribcage or some lame poem on my arm. The casino itself has some pretty nice rock memorabilia though!. . . .  There is a free shuttle to the strip before like 6pm or so.. . I wouldn't tell anyone not to go, but it is definitely for the more younger crowd, which is fine. I would like to stay at the Aria though next time I go to Vegas. Their casino was 2x as badass as the HRH.
The only reason we stayed at this place is because my husband was attending a seminar there. When we checked in, we were told we didn't get a king as requested even though we booked way in advance & were told we did have a king bed. The hotel isn't convenient to anything & we had to take cabs to go anywhere, which were ridiculously expensive.  The shuttle was never available when we needed it. HRH is very old looking & worn, from the carpet to the decor. No bathtub, which I really missed. Outdated tv with few channels & the room looked like it needed cleaned and dusted. The rock music was blaring constantly & it wasn't what I consider good old rock & roll. My husband enjoys playing blackjack but the table games started at $15. The crowd is very young, lots of tattoos & Affliction shirts. I saw security escort out  two females that appeared to be hookers. I never observed anyone winning much at the slots, which is unusual in Vegas. When we went downtown one evening, people were winning all around us, even if it wasn't big amounts. This place is dead & depressing and we wished we could have just stayed downtown when we went, at least people looked like they were having a good time there. The only positive thing I can say is that the Pink Taco had really good food. HATE this place & will NEVER go back. Only gave it one star because there wasn't a zero.
BEST hotel off the strip. Good rooms, casino, restaurants parties, clubs....etc. ALL under one roof. The 24/7 restaurant is legit!!!!! Rooms are up to date, with comfortable beds!!!! I always stay here. Some nights there are bands playing at the pool.
I live here and have never been treated as badly anywhere as I was treated here. I can go on for days telling you how bad it is but please just trust me. I can give u many more places to stay that are actually on strip and cheaper. I left there crying and I'm no crybaby. The bell captain got so asinine with me I wanted to spit on him. Nothing worked. Mostly everything was broken or closed and it takes way too long to get anyone's attention. Let alone the bartender yelled at my boy bc he wasn't making a straight line. What?! A straight line to what? Everyone there needs a hospitality class and a good strong hug from their mother. I even made a complaint on BBB and I've never done that.
When I checked in with my groupon, they did not have my name in their system, so I was told there was nothing they could do.  . . That was not sweet after I have traveled this long!  I called Groupon for customer service but they were closed so there was nothing I could do on my part too.  . . I was so tired....  I asked if any room is available and I'll just take the room with my credit card thinking they don't charge me yet and groupon can help me solve this the next day.  I had the receipt.    . . Then the staff helped me get the room at the $59 per room rate plus tax instead of using Groupon.  . Which was nice.   More nice was he gave me the 11th floor room.  The view was superb. . . All relieved, I  checked in and went to the room.  I could tell that this side of the building was very old but I give good rating to the cleaning lady; she had good vibes and 5 stars to such a comfortable bed!    . . When I went to the counter for check-out, the balance showed $130 plus tax, and resort fee of $22 plus tax.  . . The staff told me that,  this is all he can see in the computer, there is no note for the change of room rate, after I told him everything what happened at the check-in.  . . There was no sign of compassion, no sign of understanding.  . . I felt sad.  . . He went to speak to a female manager and all she tells me is the same thing. . . I told him the name of the person who checked me in and asked them repeatedly to give him a call.  She said that the staff sees many people a day so no one really remembers.  But I insisted that because this involved a certain senario that he must remember about me.  She gave in.  . . They seemed to got hold of him or something and perhaps found out that I was telling the truth that she came back from the back saying she subtracted the amount from the total balance.. . There was no apology, nothing from both the manager and the staff.  . . Not only that, when I checked out, there was unknown resort fee of $22 plus tax each night.  . . Again, I told the guy at the checkout, there was nothing said about the resort fees, if I had known, he could have shown me what it was about and what service is included in the fees so I could have enjoyed them.   Again there was no explanation at check-in.    . . He said, well you signed it.  . I am like where?. . He said when I signed on credit card machine to allow the hotel to hold $59 for security deposit.  . . And the guy said he must have told you twice about the resort fees, as if it's the rule of the hotel.  But the truth is he never did.. . So again, I told him, no I never heard anything about it.. . He repeated himself again, he needs to tell you this so you must have heard.. . What's going on?  It's not the hotel policy that I want to hear.  . . Are they not aware that all we need is their understanding and compassion?      . . This was a great example how so many people are operating from the head and do not really know how to connect to people's heart.  . . Would I ever go back there?  . . Even if the cleaning lady was nice, bed was comfortable, . . Nah.
The hard rock is a decent place to stay. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are nice and helpful. . . The casino isn't the best. I thought it would be a bigger casino , but it's pretty small compared to mot of the other casinos in Vegas. Also very limited selection in electronic games. I wish that they had more variety. . . Overall it was a good experience.
Don't seem that people go out of the way to help, got a room key that don't work and and stood in the key line for a bit and nobody helped me out, finally got someone to talk to me and they told me to get into the long check in line, no thanks. Came back later and a nice lady helped me out and got me a new key.. I ordered a single bed king size 2 months ago, instead i got a 2 bed queen, when I asked about that I was told to talk to someone else. Nice parking garage view from my room with alot of car alarms and horns nice. The rooms are dark and thats ok if your into it.. I wont be staying here again, the strip is a long walk away and the shuttle that runs from here to the strip stops at 5pm so a cab was in order.
The HRH tower is worth the extra! Stayed Thursday-Saturday. Upon checking in we were notified that our friends room (king suite) got down graded to a room with 2 queen beds. We showed the attendant the reservation, and she was quick to point out the fine print that any reservation is a "preference." Myself, never having heard of  paying additional for a suite and being downgraded I expressed my disappointment. With an attitude the attendant asked me "what do you want me to do?" Luckily a manager was available, and he offered to "move around some reservations." Although the rooms weren't readily available to us, we were told to come back at 3:30. We were told this was the check in time, despite 3:00 listed on their website and in the reservation. Also, if you need to check in your bags, know the bell desk will not check in any coolers. I brought a soft case cooler with me with some drinks and snacks and had to lug it around until our room was ready.. . Overall once we checked in we had a average experience. The year round pool was open, and heated. Restaurants Pink Taco, and Culinary Dropout were really enjoyable, affordable by Vegas standards, and it was nice to have good food options and not have to leave the hotel. The memorabilia throughout the grounds are with the stay. I recommend grabbing a cocktail, and taking a lap. If you do hit the strip, its a short cab ride, under $8.00.. . Check out was easy, staff (with the exception of the front desk) were friendly. Avoid getting an wakeup call, ours never called us. Good thing we didn't have a flight to catch!. . Bottom line- you get what you pay for. This place is a good option if you have champagne taste on a beer budget.
I can't complain over the Hard Rock. I definitely believe that the HRH tower is great for how cheap it can be.. . First of all, the service here is great. Valet takes care of you and they really hussle and move to get you your vehicle. The check in process was actually very simple. During my visit, they made it easy to combine some vouchers from Living Social I had without making us move rooms or anything like that.. . Our room was clean, it smelled great, and it came stocked with things we didn't even know, like the touch screen pads that control music and curtains. Overall, it was exciting to stay in a comfortable spot with an extremely comfortable bed!. . The food downstairs is great. Nobu - wow. It was delicious although quite pricey. It doesn't hurt to have a good meal once in a while ;]. . Mr. Lucky cafe is great too! Love their breakfast food.. . I have stayed in cheap places like Excalibur and I have also stayed at expensive places like The Encore. The Hard Rock HRH tower is definitely up there with an Encore suite. I can't wait to hopefully stay here once again.
Ok so I have stayed at the Hard Rock now twice. It ranges from cheap to moderate depending if you get it as a deal online or if you have the players card and can get deals for as low as $19 a night. The tables in the club are less then others. Yes it is off the strip. . . But to me as a music lover of all kinds, there is nothing like walking in and seeing all the costumes and covers of the records. In the summer the pools are full of life and excitement. . . If you do have a players card, when you go back and stay with the players card you do not pay the resort fee. . . The rooms are big, if you get a handicap room they are beyond huge. I personally found the beds beyond comfortable. The service is great! I have never been disappointed. And the view from some of the rooms are great. If you have a chance you really should try the spa. In addition, the choice of restaurants downstairs is amazing from PINK TACO to Mr. Lucky's 24/7, Nobu and more. . . The only down is it is off the strip, and while you could walk it is not the safest walk. But if you stay there you will certainly have a good time without paying some of the crazy expenses that that you might not want to pay all the time. . . Even if you do not get a chance to stay there or choose not to you should certainly stop by and check out the music memorabilia!
We have always wanted to stay at HRH . This past weekend we stayed at the HRH tower . From the moment we arrived , we were treat like royalty ! DID NOT meet a staff member who failed to be polite and friendly . The suite was gorgeous and exceeded our expectations . The staff at the desk in the HRH tower was top notch. NEVER have I stayed in a hotel where the staff knew my name when seeing me on sight . LOVE this treatment .
