This is my go-to hotel in Vegas.  The price is reasonable and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I've stayed at the properties on either side of the Mirage -Caesar's was just too large of a property and Treasure Island is geared toward college kids.  Mirage is the way to go!
If you enjoy less than mediocre customer service, incompetent, cold-hearted and insulting staff then this is the place for you!. . . Let me begin by saying they really make every effort to have you walk through their casino to get to the elevators.  After the inconsiderate 15 mile obstacle to get to our room, the first thing my husband noticed was the queen size bed, although he reserved a king size room...eh, oh well.  I thought the room itself was actually decent looking.  The furnishings were not too bad despite the fluorescent orange decorative pillow which looked like it had been chewed on by a dog.. . . After an enjoyable Saturday night in Vegas, I awoke very early Sunday morning to noise and lots of it.  Doors shutting, housekeeping carts trotting down the hallway, and you can actually hear the guests in the next room, but the ultimate offender was the housekeeper who walked right into our room!. . . I called the front desk and complained to the manager, Mario.  He explained there was an error between systems and they presumed our room was empty.  He then tried to compensate by offering my husband and me breakfast.  I'm sure to him it seemed like a nice gesture, but to us it felt like a slap in the face!  "Oops, we saw you exposed so here are some pancakes!  We hope you feel better!"  We refused his offer and tried to go about our day.. . . Along our way home I called The Mirage to complain once again.  This time I spoke with another manager who was even more incompetent than the previous manager.  Not only was she RUDE, but she demonstrated deplorable lack of management and customer service!  The Mirage needs to seriously rethink who they hire as "managers."  I couldn't help but shake my head and feel insulted by this woman's attitude and remarks.. . . Still feeling insulted by the rude manager and bothered by the housekeeper walking in on me, I called The Mirage once again Monday morning.  This time I spoke with Mike, another "manager" who seemed to express remorse and offered a voucher for a free nights stay during our next visit...or so I thought.  It has been 2 days and I have yet to receive my voucher via email as promised.  Not that it matters anyways because that was the first AND THE VERY LAST time I visit The Mirage!. . . BTW, the 1 star rating is for the nice aquarium by the front desk, otherwise I would give The Mirage a negative rating if possible!
Always a good stay at the Mirage. We arrive early on Super Bowl and they got us in without a problem.  Used my MLife card and got a great rate.  Nice, comfortable beds with very clean bathrooms.. Used the gym every morning (was not easy after being out all night). Ate at Heritage and Cravings.. Enjoyed outside beverage at the Rhumbar.. Good central location and very friendly staff.
On my recent visit here I went to the buffet. The food was great, it was very good quality and lots of choices, I wasn't crazy about the $34.99 place but hay it's Vegas. I would go back.
We always have issues checking in here. They always give some excuse as to why we can't get the room we booked. I'm over this place comped rooms or not. Not coming back here.
What makes The Mirage refreshing is once you enter, the first thing you see is a beautiful plant display rather than slot machines and gambling tables. This is especially important for families, since I'm sure parents don't want their kids breathing down "Vegas" every minute. If you have kids, visit the dolphin habitat and let them take pictures in the Beatles telephone booth (right by the entrance), OR BETTER YET take them to see LOVE since it's right in the hotel. . . REVOLUTION bar is a must-stop for those over 21 catching the LOVE show. Though this hotel doesn't really have shopping like Caesar's or Aria or the Venetian, there is a small Sugar Factory candy shop.
Stayed at the Mirage for two days 2/12/14 & 2/13/14.. Was there for DSE. Room was $70 pluse resort fee per night via Expedia. The hotel was in a great location next to the Venetian and its outside and inside appearance was top notch for an older hotel. . . Despite other reviews to the contrary, the condition of the rooms and common area was top notch. I had room 17-100 and it was sweeet!. Just have a gander at the pics.. . I little musty at first, but an open wibdow for 10min cleared that up. I ate and drank on the strip..so no opinion of resturants. But big points on an easy 11:30am check-in, nice staff, and easy check out. I am planning a return trip for pleasure and am bringing my gf as the rooms were made to party.. . Pros:. Clean updated rooms. Clean common areas. Cheap price on Expedia. Location. . Cons:. Not the best in house clubs...but who cares
Stayed here with some sorority sisters. I didn't pay or contribute to paying because of a hook-up, so my evaluation does not include value. . . Pools: They're alright. The beach club "bare" was literally empty. It has a strange scene. Really empty, and the bar tender wasn't particularly good. We got a bunch of free drinks though, haha.
We stopped by to see the volcano show. It was pretty awesome haha I liked the fire and the heat! We were watching it from across the street and we could feel the heat coming our way. It was awesome. I liked the music too! It's not like classical beautiful music like bellagio but like jungle amazon kinda music. Very exotic!
Le Mirage est un hotel un peu vieillissant mais tres bien entretenu. Immense Aquarium a la reception, chutes d'eau et jungle au rez de chaussee, plein de restos dans l'enceinte de l'hotel-casino, chambres tres tres tres spacieuses, tres belle vue sur la coupole de l'hotel, et enfin, magnifique spectacle nocturne (son, lumiere, jets d'eau et flammes).. . Attention : ne soulevez RIEN dans le minibar ou sur le plateau de confiseries, meme pas une seconde, car tout ce que vous touchez est facture (meme si non emporte/consomme). Petite erreur de ma part, j'ai effleure un article qui s'est retrouve facture, mais ce fut tres vite regle et rembourse via un simple mail adresse a la reception. Le room-service n'est pas trop trop cher en revanche. . . Nous n'avons pas pu tester la piscine mais on nous en a dit du bien, notamment des "pool parties" (fetes avec des DJ connus qui mixent au bord du bassin). . . Hyper pratique : l'express checkout, qui vous permet de quitter l'hotel sans faire la queue et en gardant les cartes d'acces (qui sont simplement desactivees). . . L'hotel est un peu cher comme tous les grands casinos de Vegas : mais Vegas, c'est Vegas.
The first person I see upon arriving at the Mirage is Olivia. She automatically smiles as she greets us and asks what she can help us with. Not only did she help us find the perfect suite for my birthday but she also for us a discount and helped with the hotel fee. The entire time she was smiling and extremely helpful and courteous. She made the entire experience enjoyable especially when I've seen how unfriendly so many people can be here in Vegas. Thank you so much for your help and kindness Olivia!!
Stayed here on my most recent Vegas trip and was very happy with everything. This for the price was probably the best value I have seen in a long time. The rooms were well lit, had comfy beds, good strong showers, and non of that smoke smell that you often get in Vegas. The check in desk was fast and friendly. The hotel itself has a lot of restaurants and bars though we were out of the hotel much more than we were in it. They give guests discounts for the Secret Garden which was a nice bonus. We had a great view of the pools where we could watch the dolphins swimming in the mornings which is a fantastic way to wake up! The mini bar was the best stocked I have ever seen and the prices were not to out there! I would stay here again for sure. There was always plenty of parking as well.
They saved themselves a 1 star hatchet job by comping my room (and  I don't even gamble!). I had no wifi and repeated calls did not remedy until late the next day when a maintenance finally guy came by, opened a hidden panel and flicked a switch to reset it.  I needed keep my work inbox clear and being unable to do so without getting dressed and going out was not acceptable as I prefer to work in my underwear.. . Otherwise a decent hotel, with a good breakfast buffet though, being Vegas, you had to take the maze thru the nasty smelling casino to get anywhere. Whatever they use to mask the smells of cigarettes and desperation creates an subtle but sickeningly saccharine smell.  . . Oh yea, good volcano.
