was just there for 3 nights and couldnt get better service..every single request was done with the greatest pleasure ..starting from Parking,Bell Boy,Room Service,Dining,and Front desk...every one was so accomidating and friendly staff... Will for sure stay there again....
This place is solid.  Modern and clean.  . . Here is a good tip for everybody... I booked the place off priceline for Mandalay Bay (cheapest room available)  Then I went to check-in and when I spoke with the front desk guy, I sandwiched a $20 between my credit card and ID and asked for a FREE upgrade.  He moved me to 750 sf suite at The Hotel.  I checked the prices and I saved a little, but the room itself was gigantic.  . . I would suggest tipping more for longer stays and for a bigger room.  Just book the cheapest and grease the guy.  Obviously its a gamble, I was lucky to get it for one night on Friday night of superbowl weekend.  . . Now, I utilize this tactic whenever I am going to take my date or girlfriend out.  I book the cheapest room and grease the guy a little more so that I can get a better room for the buck.. . Obviously, if your a big gambler get the room comped, but otherwise, do this.. . What else is to say about The Hotel?  Its an awesome place.  Clean, modern and I like how its a great alternative to Palazzo, Cosmo, Aria, and Vdara... but easier to get a room since those casinos steal most of the spotlight.. . Also checkout Strip Steak.  Awesome place for steaks, though I heard STK at the Cosmopolitan is even better.
Great hotel! Called to make reservations and the lady checked 4 different times for special promotions to get me the best deal. She then asked if I was a M life member and since I was transferred me to VIP services. They were able to get the best deal at $460 for 2 nights on Valentines day weekend. NOT a bad deal for a 1 bedroom 1 1/2 bath suit. Happy with the first call to make my reservation, from there on it was even better. . . We arrived Valet was quick to direct us forward although they looked slammed. We went straight to the lobby and checked in within 10-15 minutes. Pretty quick for a Vegas hotel. Other reviews I read suggested asking for an upgrade. I did and they had 1 upgrade for our first night available. Since I didn't want to change rooms in the middle of our stay, I stuck with our regular suite. Lobby was beautiful, smelled good when you walked in and had a nice little lounge for my friends to hang at. . . We went up to our room on the 13th floor. I know crazy since most Vegas hotels don't have a 13 floor. It was beautiful the room was very clean, new and perfect for our stay! We had 2 queens and the room was very spacious. The living room also was very spacious! We were happy with the room all together. We had 1 full bathroom with a closed off door for the toilet, a large sink area for all my makeup ;) a bath that had a fountain like spout vs the typical spout on a bath and a stand up shower. Even included a scale which I stayed away from alllll weekend long!. . So all was well and it was linked to Mandalay Bay which had the casino and amazing restaurants to enjoy! Also, there was the tram over to Excalibur so even though it was a little far on the strip there way a quick, easy, free way to where you wanted to go!
First time guest at TheHotel. I was very impressed by the cleanliness and value I received as an M-Life member. I usually stay at Aria which I love but I can't say there was anything I disliked about the Mandalay Bay/TheHotel combo. The only recommendations I have; please update the televisions in the rooms they are very old. Also the shower head in my room had terrible pressure. Other than that 0 complaints.
There are enough reviews here to get the idea that this is a pretty sweet spot.  I'll only give a minor tip for any coffee drinkers out there.  Don't expect the free in-room coffee maker in the morning.  There is a Keurig machine, however coffee 'kits' are available for $4 each.  [I was staying in a suite].  If you absolutely must have your morning coffees, save yourself money and just pack a few of your own k-cups.
I stayed in a suite for the vet show and out of all the vegas hotels I've stayed at, this one was ok. Nothing special. Bed was comfortable but for a suite, it was just average.
TheHotel should be more appropriately named TheWorstHotel...truly. I travel to Vegas frequently and Mandalay Bay is one of my go-to hotels--that is, until now. I'm currently here for the UFC Fight Night and I booked my room months ago. I booked two nights at the Mandalay Bay through a promotion for their Great Suite Room, and I was pumped. Upon arrival however, the front desk notified me that the suite was no longer available and that I would actually be enjoying a room in TheHotel tower. Now, I understand occupancy and that sometimes room availability can change....but to move me to a completely different hotel?. . Anyway, we trekked across Mandalay and finally got to our room on the 3rd floor--and were appalled. First off, it is the smallest room I have ever seen in Vegas, and WAY smaller than even the standard rooms in the Mandalay tower. The view is awful (see photo). There is zero soundproofing. The TV is a boob tube, seriously. And the room is downright filthy. Stains everywhere, bugs, etc. I called the front desk and they offered no assistance, saying there was nothing they could do. I toughed it out last night, and woke up this morning to call again--but I was put on hold for 20 minutes and they never picked up. Unreal.. . (Update on 2/24) The story gets better though. The woman at the front desk at check-out asked how my stay was, and I told her the truth. She didn't seem to care in the least, and simply responded by saying, "Hopefully your experience will be better next time". HA! There won't be a next time. And then she massively overcharged me - nearly doubling the amount that I actually owed. Completely unacceptable. . This is not at all the experience I was hoping for. I will not be staying at Mandalay ever again. Horrible customer service and horrible hotel!
What an amazing stay! The suite was gorgeous and as clean as I have ever seen. The staff were extremely friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  We even had our maid notice that we had some leftover food, so without being asked, she had a fridge brought in for us.  The bed was extremely comfy, as was the most luscious  robe and slippers on the planet. The only problem with this hotel was that I eventually had to leave. From valet, to front desk, to  bell personnel, to maids, and everything in between, the service was beyond compare. Cant wait to go back!
Great night with great friends!! Thank you so much to the mix crew for making last night awesome!! Thank u Eric, Justin and Olivier for your great hospitality! Mix at Mandalay bay/THEHotel really knows how to treat their guests like VIPs!! Can't wait to go back again!!
My husband and I got married at Mandalay bay hotel and have loved coming to The hotel ever since. We first stayed in the largest suite, where we hosted a very fun reception for fifty people. We were treated very well and have had many similar experiences every time we've come back. . I like the contemporary design, very classy and I have become obsessed with finding a scent that smells as good as their hallways! There are only suites at The Hotel, all are very spacious and comfortable with out the cold vibe of some newer hotels . The service is great and everyone is very nice and helpful! We are often surprised  by the deals that we get on rooms here. Last time, we got a night stay for $100 + including the resort fee! . . I definitely recommend staying here while you can before Delona takes over The Hotel.
This could've gotten 4 stars for the cleanliness of the hotel, the convenience of having Mandalay Bay right next door, as well as the shops available nearby, but because of the service I received, two stars will be taken away. . . Booked 2 queen suites here for President's day weekend and when we arrived to check in, they told us the rooms were not available but we could get a much "better" deal at Mandalay Bay (2 deluxe queen rooms) and $200 credit back to use for food/beverages. I was thinking, hm, I guess that'd be okay since it's supposed to be just a tad smaller (or so the guy told us) and was immediately available. We asked for two non-smoking queen rooms then and when we got to Mandalay, dear lord it stunk of smoke. I was pretty furious at that point because . 1. How come other people were able to check into their rooms immediately and were not given this "offer" and persuaded to take it. 2. This is clearly not "just a tad" smaller, it was a whole living room and bathroom smaller.. 3. It smells like smoke which I super duper hate in hotel rooms that are non-smoking. . So, I called them back and said, no I don't want this crap I want the rooms I booked at theHotel. And guess what? They immediately found two queen suites available. Wow. Talk about shady customer service.. . Yes I know you guys are stereotyping because I'm a small Asian college girl who looks like I'm trying to save money and would just overlook your terrible service - but you are very very mistaken.. . Anyway, after that experience, would I choose theHotel again? Only as a last resort.
