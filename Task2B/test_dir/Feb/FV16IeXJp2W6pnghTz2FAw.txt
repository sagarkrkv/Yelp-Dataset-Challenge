This place is solid and unforgettable. . . My fave dishes here are the (very unique) vermicili(esp. the one with spring rolls and fried tofu or sprimp)... It's ingredients are multifaceted, and the sweet and sour sauce on top is the only sweet and sour sauce I've ever enjoyed. The pho with brisket is yummy, but I'd like to try the pho at Pho So(which somehow looks better) to compare.. . Drunken noodles here are great(any or all meats); so are the potstickers.. . I dislike: the spring rolls(they always taste old and bland); the Thai tea here sucks, so get a... Vietnamese coffee instead. Or an avocado smoothie!. . Call to make a reservation for a group dinner, or your legs will regret it. Prices are reasonable--some dishes are maybe $2ish overpriced in comparison to nyc/sf spots... But who cares when you're a block from the Strip.
Underwhelmed.. . Seating was prompt, order taking was not.. When dude did arrive, he jacked up my order. I selected #28, Hu Tieu (seafood pho); got egg noodles instead of the rice noodles that I requested. Broth was interesting as it had a strong ginger finish but that didn't make it good. The ingredients were WAY over-cooked to the point that I thought the squid were random pieces of wonton that had fallen into the pot, completely devoid of flavour and with a splatty texture. Shrimp were pink and white curly cues pared from superball material and the cheapy sort, very small sans tail. The sliced jalepenos musta been prepped last week as they were brown around the edges and flaccid.. . Left without the usual "Pho FUPA" that I've come to associate with consuming a bowl full of love due the small serving size and sub-par ingredients.. . There are heaps of better Pho joints in Vegas- go to one of them.
What?!! Pho that is priced at close to $10 a bowl should not have one $. There are too many options for pho on Spring Mountain road to unnecessarily fork over that extra dough. The decor is nice and swanky but you pay for that swank with your extra bucks.. . Only time it may be worth parting with your dough is if you wander in at 3am because they'll be one of the few establishments open. Head elsewhere's during regular business hours. Spend your cash where it counts.
Best place in Chinatown!!!. Worth the wait
Since we moved from San Francisco Bay Area, we had a hard time finding a good pho restaurant. But finally, Pho Kim Long delivered! While not super fancy, the pho was pretty good. And open 24/7!. . We now have peace of mind that when we crave a bowl of pho, Pho Kim Long is there.
Pho Kim long, good food all night long. . . Most people either hate or love this restaurant. I love it. I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal here. . . My go to order is the beef pho with rare steak $7.75.. I pile my steaming bowl high with Thai basil, fresh squeezed lime, and only two jalapeno rings (any more and it gets too spicy towards the end).. . You can add extra meat or extra noodles for only $1.00, but I can never eat that much. I usually don't finish my broth and then take it to go and boil noodles for a redo the next day! Score. double meals. . . I've tried a lot of the menu and some of my favorites include:. the chicken wings covered in Pho Kim Long sauce;. the walnut-mayonnaise shrimp; and . Oh so tender Calamari.. . Pho Kim Long is comfort food whenever you need it. Don't ever change.
Great Pho, as always. I tried the drunken noodles and it was amazing! I have yet to try something I don't like. We drive over 30 minutes to get here and it's well worth the drive.
Ugh!!! I used to come here every Saturday after Japanese school with my mom. . I have FOND memories here, but something has happened. Something terrible...... . .  - The servers don't speak English nor do they speak any other Asian language. .  - I ordered tea and got a green tea bag in my mug... A MUG!! ... GREEN TEA!! .  - The small dish for dipping is a deep black little cup (customary for ketchup or ranch) . . . If you know Pho.. AUTHENTIC PHO you know those three points are enough for a strike. . . The taste has declined andI was SO incredibly disappointed. . . Highly Americanized and the awful parking lot really doesn't make this place worth your time or calories.
This place always seems to hit all the right spots when I want some good Vietnamese food. We ordered some pho and Mongolian beef and both were good. I was expecting some bamboo shoots in my Mongolian beef, but it was missing. Other than that, the food was good and I had leftovers from the beef dish- it was good enough to feed 2... Or maybe even 3.. . I'll probably come here the next time I am in town and want some pho.
HORRIBLE PHO.  . . I saw the 1000+ reviews so couldn't go wrong yet were totally disappointed; really questions those reviews.   Actually, this place is more catered toward westerners who know shit about Vietnamese noodle.  The broth was completely tasteless; just salt and sugar in water.   Beside the pho, try order something else .. Bun Bo Hue .. even worst .. how about egg noodle soup and wonton?  Not any better.  . . Would I try again?  HELL NO.  Would I recommend this place to friends?  NEVER.
Pho Kim Sucks!. . I really hate to write bad reviews but.. I am so scared to eat pho now ever since I've ate here.. The bo vien was not good at all. It didn't even taste like legit Vietnamese meatballs... It tasted so artificial and Americanized?... . . . Also, the waiter asked us if we wanted a large or small but when the bill came out, the small bowl of pho was the same price as the large.... Uhhhhh what?.. . . . I think this place is all just hype. There's nothing special about it besides the catchy name. The restaurant looks nice but food? Ehh... My friend is a true pho lover and can eat pho 1-2x a week and even she didn't like this place.... If you're a true pho lover, you'll know what real pho taste like..
Their seafood soup sucks: no variety and soup base is just fried onions in water. And we had to send it back because the soup was warm.   Order something else.
Thank you "random cosmopolitan valet guy" for leading us right to best place for pho in Vegas.  Pho Kim Long hits the spot big time. Broth is tasty and service is really swift. My friends ordered different kinds of Pho and were not disappointed.  I personally went with the non-Pho route and ordered the Bun Bo Hue like all my fellow yelpers and it was spectacular.  (Mind you, i'm not really partial to having a beef foot in my soup ... yeah, not really my style - but, it was the bomb. seriously, it was so good.) I'll be back.  I'll definitely be back.  BTW, the eggs rolls were good too.  . . Side note:  After you've inhaled your grub  - you'll notice that there aren't any cabbies waiting outside to take your semi-sober self back to your hotel on the strip, so you'll have to take a chance at hailing one right on Spring Mountain.  It feels kinda shady at 2a, but you'll be fine if you have a few folks with you. . . Side note 2: be careful of saying "pho-kim-long" out loud if front of your three year old. He repeats it out in public and people start giving your bad looks :)
This place is pretty packed for 3.5 stars but I'm giving them 1 star because I ordered pho and normally I like my rare steak on the side but this place charges $1 for that option. OK.. 25 cents I could understand but a dollar? It doesn't cost a dollar to clean an extra plate and I'm sure the plate isn't that big anyways. Oh and also hot tea is not free. $1 per cup. Is it just a Nevada thing or is it just this place? Our pho arrived and I thought WTH. Isn't pho dac biet suppose to have a lot of meat not like 5 pieces? My bf dug everything up from the bottom of his bowl and the picture provided is what it looks like. Not worth the money.
Four stars for their quality of food and how quickly it comes out. Their egg rolls are delicious, and they have a great com bo luck lac dish as well as their mi xao don. Most dishes are prepared quite well. My boyfriend loves their pho, but I am not a huge fan. It's not bad, it's just not authentic. It tastes as if they didn't have time to allow all the flavors of the star anise and herbs to get pulled into the broth itself. Probably because of their high rate of table turns. All in all, great food though... available 24 hours which is a huge plus.. The only reason I only give them 4 stars is because they lack customer service and caring for their patrons. They seem to be so busy, that they just want you to eat and get the hell out. Lol! I guess I can't blame them... to go is always a great option if you're looking for quality food fast with no customer service. It's probably best to get to go so you don't get offended or upset by their service.
You really can't expect much, 24 hour pho place in Vegas... . There's always a line and when they tell you 10 minutes, they really mean 20. I guess you really can't complain about Asian places...
This restaurant caters to tourist. I totally understand that many small businesses survive off of tourism here...but I just wasn't impressed. I came for the food not the ambience or decor. It gets packed in here. The tables are small...no elbow room at all so it feels like you have to overlap your arms with your neighbor to try and get a chopstick full of food in your mouth. The servers were servers...customer service could be improved but then again they didn't speak much English...I think that night they had nothing but Brazilians serving. . Go E.O.E.!. . The food is just ok. It doesn't taste any kind of authentic...it's pretty bland. I dislike having to add salt in broth when I go to Pho restaurants and that's what I had to do here...uugh. Get the broth right please! The water cups look like they've been run through the dishwasher a thousand times too many. But the soda was good. Our bill for the 4 of us came out to be about $90...WTF?! I've never spent so much on PHO! . . To sum it up...it's pricey, bland and made for tourist. I would only come here for a late nite 2am Pho craving...but then again there are other 24 hour pho places too. The bells and whistles here are nice but if you don't have the taste of the food to back it up it's just not worth it. . . I like saying the restaurant name long and slow though...tickles me every time!
Order the beer lol !!!!
Pho Kim Long is Pho Kim WRONG. . I didn't come for the Pho. We had the orange chicken and the black bean beef. Both orders including the rice disappointed.. . The black bean beef was the better of the two dishes. The meat was chewy which I do not enjoy. There was about 5 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the plate. Too greasy for me. . . The orange chicken looks delicious until you try to eat it. Some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. It's hard to describe. I'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. It was like no chicken I've ever had. Maybe it was old or frost bitten. The texture was not chicken. I could not get my around eating it at all. . . Rice. How do you mess up rice?  The white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. The brown rice was undercooked and hard. . . Service was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill.   I was there on a Saturday night around 12a and the wait was short. . . With all the places Vegas has to offer. I would never go back to this dump.
This place is awesome! The pho was so authentic! We also ordered a sandwich, I must say that the bread was some of the best  I've ever had ! Its a must !
Service is a bit slow but the food is amazing. Despite the many times I've been there I haven't had a bad dish.  I always make it a point to eat here when I'm in Vegas. I've had the pho, fried eggplant in garlic, fried chicken wings in garlic, wonton soup with egg noodles, ong choy, steamed chicken, Singapore noodles, fish in black bean sauce, pan fried noodles, honeydew smoothie, thai tea and thai coffee.  All fabulous. There's been a wait most times I've been here but it's definitely worth it.
I will give this restaurant credit...I had a long night with some good friends and stumbled in here at 7:00am looking for pho. That being said, the food/ service was a little haphazard. . . I ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. . . The service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after. He failed to bring out my spring rolls and then hassled me when I asked to have my nonexistent spring rolls removed from the bill. . . Kudos for them being open 24/7, but there are at least 5 better pho joints with .5 miles. Go there.
Go to spot for Pho when visiting LV. You know this place is good when you see the line of Asians standing outside and overflowing into the parking lot. This place starts to get pretty busy around noon, so try to beat the crowd if you can because they don't take reservations. It's a dollar or two more expensive then the pho you're used to paying for at home, but it's good. I love all of their rice plates and side dishes too. When I go with groups we always get the greenbeans with minced pork and garlic. Soooo yummy! They're not too far from the strip either, so if you need to cab it, it won't be too expensive.
Best spot for late night noodle cravings. One of my coworkers brought me here and it is so good. It's always busy and there is always a short wait but that means the food is good. I have ordered the crab rangoons, Vietnamese spring rolls, Singapore noodles, lettuce wraps, and the rare steak pho. Everything here is so good and made to order so it is hot and fresh. . . If you're craving Vietnamese or Chinese food anytime of the day then come here.
This has to be the best "vegan" pho I've had in vegas , they fill that plate with goodies .. at some point i got tired of eating as it was way to much vegetables .. . The noodles were soggy :)
i never wrote review in my life but today one server is making me to. i always come here and still might come but i am so UPSET. one server who brought us the dishes was extremely rude!!! dishes of my friend n i were switched n i didn't know so i asked. he said "i said thats number 13 " in a very rude annoyed way. then he just went away. also he threw other dishes at our table. . I dont even want to give one star. My bf n I always give more than 18% tip however not today. . I always order number 13 which is combination pho. there were no meats today. I wanted to say something but I was so upset already I did not want to say another word. . I know this place is always crowded so the service isnt so good but i ate around 3pm. Also it never wasn't that bad. Today was the WROST EVER!! i'll go to other places
Overall:. Been here twice and of the 1001 pho places in Vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.. . Food: I typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.. . Service: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. English is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.. . Atmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.
Came in late last night for dinner and saw a short line of people. Fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. . . This place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. . . One of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food.
Wow, 24 hours of Pho that actually tastes delicious? You have GOT to be kidding me.. . We flew into Vegas and got situated in our home base (Treasure Island) at around 11pm. We got to Pho Kim Long, and giggled like idiotic teenage boys, at around midnight. The place was slammed. Super busy. We were seated immediately, and the hostess was incredibly friendly. We call this "Las Vegas" friendly. Like they're so used to tourists, it's just second nature to make the assumption that we're not from the area and treat us kindly so as not to destroy our vacation. There's a lot of this over there, and for that we're super grateful, being earthy, awkward Portlandians. . . We ordered our drinks (I just had water, my partner ordered a beer) and before my partner's beer even had the chance to arrive we were served our starter (the salad rolls), followed quickly by the two delicious orders of Pho. Their peanut sauce was splendid, and the pho makes this my second favorite of all pho places I've been to, ESPECIALLY at midnight! The beer, unfortunately, came toward the end of dinner which is a no-no as far as my partner is concerned. Given the volume of customers that night, and the wonderful food and friendly, quick service, it was forgivable enough for us to come back and order take away to take back to our room a couple nights later when we were actually craving that delicious soup! We cannot wait to order from them again, in house or take away, either way the food is just as wonderful!
Went based on reviews here and the reviews def were right.. The place is very good. Nicer and more formal than most Pho places.  The vietnamese coffee was good but was shocked they go ahead and do it for you and put it in a to go cup.  Kind of killed the usual experience.  . . The salt and pepper calamari was great. The meatball pho was excellent and the broth was light and not oily. Lots of selection!!  Look at the whole menu before you order.  No tripe though ... which I was very shocked by,
Awesome and great service
