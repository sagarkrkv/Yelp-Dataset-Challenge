0 stars! Booked a Michael Jackson cirque de soleil. We waited all month for our show and it turned off half way through! Mandalay bay will refund money but what about the extra day we booked and extra money to pick up tickets, so disappointed and unhappy with whole experience at Mandalay bay and cirque de soleil, never again! Spend your money elsewhere and you will probably be happier.
We always stay in summer in this hotel, totally recommended, my kids love the beach, lazy river and all the different pools available, great for families!!
I am writing to update my previous review. Unfortunately my group and I originally had an undesirable experience at the Michael Jackson ONE show  after technical difficulties ended the show not even a quarter of the way through. A group of 12 of us all were in town to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday and the show was the big event of the weekend. Needless to say, we all left extremely disappointed. . A guest relations specialist, quickly responded to my original review asking to hear about my experience, express their sincere apologies, and work to make it up to us.  It proves that Mandalay Bay really cares about their customer's experience and wants each guest to have a positive experience. Thank you.
This is not my favorite resort on the strip.  For me, the check-in lines are unacceptably long and it's filled with kids (no offense to kids--I have three darlings of my own).  In the summer, this is definitely a great place to go with kids because they will enjoy the lazy river and wave pool.  If you find yourself there without kids and not realizing that "One Direction" is in concert, you had better hit the adult only pool for a little serenity!  LOL  . . That being said, I love the lounges and restaurants here.  My room was fine--a few hiccups with house-keeping, but all around fine.  Again, bring the kids.
Mandalay Bay has surely fallen from its prime. Older, isolated, and dim, it is not the jewel of Las Vegas it once used to be.. . The buffet is not bad, but second tier. Casino floor size is not as large as some of the other casinos. Its a 15-20 minute walk to the hot spots on the strip.
Great place to say at.
Horrible Horrible Horrible. Typically I would give Mandalay Bay a 5-star review but not this go around. Being that this stay was on Valentines Day I wanted things to be a little bit special. So I decided to get an upgraded room with a king bed.... . So to start when I checked in they had given my king bed away to a convention so, only a room with two queens was available. Pissed but not trying to let it ruin my weekend I accept the room and go about my day. As I walk into my downgraded 2 queen bedroom  the entire room smells like weed and as I set my bags down on the table I notice there's weed crumbs scattered all over the office table. So my natural reaction was to call the front desk to get my room switched again and see if they possibly would have a king available. Low and behold what do you know they magically came up with a king bedroom 3 floors down with a view of the roof. But, before I could switch my room I had to wait 35 minutes for the security guards to show up so that I could give some lame 2 minute statement. The whole situation was a little shady.. . Needless to say nothing was rectified and no credits were given to satisfy the customer. I honestly would have switched hotels if it wasn't for Vegas being completely full for Valentines. . . So much for Mandalay "Loving the Resortist"!!!
Rooms are nicely decorated, spacious and spacious but the rooms are dim and a few brighter bulbs could be installed.  Beds aren't that comfortable but maybe that is by design to keep you playing in the casino.  Plenty of restaurants but the ones I ate in were okay -- not stellar.  Casino was typical.  I would stay again.
Definitely not what it used to be. Overall it was a good experience but not optimal by any means. The sad thing was that the hotel appears petty - lots of nickle and diming. For example if you go to the Starbucks they charge you .54 for water even though you buy coffees. The hotel added charges that upon checkin I was told would be complimentary. Then it was a hassle to remove those charges. We came to Vegas in a EV and the chargers at mandelay were always occupied forcing me to check out other hotels for charging options. At aria I found, through my limited interaction with them, the completely opposite scenario.
How do you find the perfect room in Vegas?. Step 1: Find the most expensive hotels on the Strip.. Step 2: Eliminate any hotels that have been opened less than a year, have had movies filmed about them (bye, bye, Bellagio), are on the bad end of the Strip, or can be found in your hometown.. Step 3: Eff it! There's still 20+ hotels on this list. Just go with Mandalay Bay.. . I've stayed at the Mandalay a couple of different times. Love the suites. Love the effing lotion. OH.MY.GOSH! You can buy that crack in a bottle downstairs, but forget that. I take them directly from the maid carts when they come to clean my room. I'm sure my luggage has had a full-luggage-cavity-search because of the ridiculous amount of Mandalay Bay lotions in it. Actually, I'm surprised I haven't been put on a no fly list yet.. . I only go to Vegas in October for a week of birthday+Halloween celebrations and I think I've only ever ran into four kids in the span of three years, but I'm sure they're there...lurking in the corners waiting for some unsuspecting guest to feed them something with sugar, only to turn out to be a human sized Gremlin. But whatevs, my trips have been safe and Gremlin-free thus far.. . I could stay at the Mandalay my entire trip and still wouldn't be able to experience everything it has. But I think I've got the gist of it. Topless pool. Beach. Shark Reef. Lazy River. Bombdotcom buffets. Upscale restaurants. An infinite amount of ways to lose every penny to your name. I love it!. . Like any holiday in Vegas, Halloween week is serious. So as you can imagine, Mandalay has tons of events going on and you'll run in to some cool characters and some dumb ones too. Tip of the day: NEVER GET IN AN ELEVATOR WITH ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON ON BOARD (unless you know the other person). My first trip I got stuck on an elevator for about 30 minutes with a mid-30's drunken buffoon that started crying. When entering an elevator immediately ask your self if the people on the elevator will entertain or annoy you. If there's only one person, choose another elevator because options are always nice.. . I've walked the (entire) Strip before. I never plan on doing it again (not even a small section of the strip). I prefer my rentals and cabs 100% so MB's location works out perfect. Easy access on and off the Strip.. . The suites. I've stayed in a couple different ones and strangely enough the smallest one is actually my favorite. If it's just you, you're going to be eating out every meal (which, why wouldn't you?), and you'll be out til 7 am-ish...stay in the Great Room Suite. It's open and everything about it is comforting. I'm still trying to figure out how to smuggle out the chaise/couch thing...I want it. I need it. I can't find one anywhere.. . If you're sharing you're hotel tab with a friend, go with the Extra Bedroom Suite. Amazing views too!. . Play the slots. Get some food. Go get married. Swim topless. STAY AT THE MANDALAY BAY!. . Oh and you can check-out via phone. K thanks!
The resort property, casino & shops are wonderful. Being a local I usually avoid the strip unless I have guests or are seeing a show.  Last night it was the latter.  We decided to eat at Hussongs Cantina then saw the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show.  In between we walked around, shopped, gambled and listen to some great music in the lounge.  The casino is roomy and fun and you didn't die of thirst waiting for a cocktail waitress.  Great friendly service from everyone.
We just spent 3 days at Mandalay Bay. Having not been to Las Vegas since 1999, I was unaware of the new layout of the strip. I don't like leaving long reviews so let me rate each of the aspects of our stay and services.. . (Grades A-F). . Buffet D+. ( I honestly didn't find a difference in the quality of food from this buffet to Old Country except Mandalay Bay charges $35). . Lobby  A. Check In B. Valet A+. (The valet was amazing, always pin point always on time). . Elevators A. Room B. . Billing Department C.  (We got charged for touching snacks but not eating them in our room but they did take care of it and refunded us). . Casino C. Pool D+ . (only one pool open winter time and we both got sick). . Location D- . (This casino is the last casino or first depending on how you look at it on the strip). . Resort Fee F. (Why are we paying for a resort fee in February when a little tiny pool is opened and only opened till 5?). . I do not believe we would ever stay here again. The location of the casino created transportation issues. I would def stay at a hotel in the middle of the strip. Overall though if location isn't an issue for you and if you do not mind dealing with there billing department stay here. It was very clean, very comfortable.
Thank you Mandalay bay for a great weekend! Even though I'm not worth a million bucks you sure made me feel like I am! Amazing rooms and top notch service, sorry for taking 2K from you...not!!
Nice casino but the drink service near the slot machines is really bad.  They need to work on this issue. The common phrases are that "I will be back" or "I will let the server  know."  Nice servers but bad service.
I stayed the weekend of the 21st and booked a king suite and was told only 2 queen was available.  The hotel was very empty, no lines to check in........so I was being bullshitted..........called anonymously later to front desk to see if i could get a King suite that night and they said YES!   Next time I will stay at another hotel......Mandalay ruined a birthday weekend celebration for me and my wife...........
I've never actually stayed here (have been many times though) but I wanted to review anyways for their amazing customer service! I made a reservation from 2/21 to 2/23 for my sister's bachelorette weekend. Reservations were easy to make and the person I spoke with was great. Unfortunately, there was a death in the family and we were unable to go on this trip :( :( :(. . BUT, when I called the hotel and explained to them this madness, they were very understanding and gave me my full refund back on my deposit, despite the 48 hour cancellation notice requirement. I told the person I spoke with on the phone how deeply grateful I was for this understanding and would return when I come out next time. Now this is great customer service!!. . I can't wait to stay here when it comes time to hit up Vegas again (which I sure hope it soon!)
Our first trip back since the wedding started out awesome, We had a comp for 2 nights with a suite upgrade. (if available) We were told by the clerk that there might be "like a $30 upgrade charge". We loved the suite. We had another great experience at Aureole. The bartender, food and ambiance there was great as usual.. .  On Sunday, we tried to checkout using the TV, but it was having issues. We went downstairs to the front desk to checkout and was greeted with a charge 10 times more than the what was quoted to us originally. The manager Takeshi said the most he could do was to discount the first night 50% since we had already used the room. I asked him to contact the original clerk to verify the price he quoted. Well sure enough he was unable to be reached. Takeshi said he would be in for his shift at 5pm and ask him then. Great, we drive home not knowing how much we are going to be charged. That was a miserable 4 hours debating when to call Mandalay or the creditcard and dispute the charges.. .  When we get home and check my e-mail I see the corrected charges on a receipt from Mandalay sent 15 minutes after we left.  I'm thinkin'  a call would have made the drive home a lot more pleasant. We gave you a contact number before we left. . .  On Monday my wife called to remind them the tips for the spa were not on the corrected receipt.. She wanted to make sure the spa staff got their tips. i checked the credit card charges, I see 2 pending charges. They have not only the overcharged comped room, but the corrected charges pending also. Never got a call back from Takeshi. Thanks for making us follow up on your mistake. . .  After a call to the credit card co. it looks to be straightened out finally. . . TLDR: Free Suite/ then $30 Suite/ then 10x more/ then double charge/ finally $30/ still no call from manager. Make sure you get a quote in writing for an upgrade or they make you pay 10x more.. . Managers quote "You used the room you have to pay"
Home away from home I love this place summer winter any time of year service is amazing rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. Buffet is small but had a great variety in my opinion one of the better buffets in the MGM line of hotels!
