Really impressed. First time staying here and I couldn't have been happier.
I wish I could pick 3 and a half as my star rating on this hotel. This is definitely NOT  a five star hotel. Some pro and cons. . . Pros: Decorated beautifully, no smoky interior, large rooms, fridge, microwave, even a tea kettle, free parking, free shuttle to Caesars Palace, kids get a little welcome gift, huge bath tub, small walk to the fashion show mall, no hallway noise, & nice front desk staff. . . Cons: Valet only, resort fee (but every hotel on the strip has one), no turn down service, if your get a "city view" room it's noisy because the trains, no casino, & freeway noise. . . Some issues with our stay consisted of:. Old water in our tea kettle that we didn't put in there. . Hair all over the robe in the bathroom.. Hair in the bathtub.. Lamp that was torn and broken.. . Didn't make too big a fuss cause it was only a one night stay, but I kind of expected more from a "five star" hotel.
The Trump was a very nice option vs. the big strip casions.  Nice size rooms for the price but I am still very unhappy with the "Resot Fee" that has become the general change for Hotel and casinos.  The Trump does not have a any gambling so that cut down on the traffic of people, nosie, and smoke.  But there does not seem to be much for dinning or a large bar. However, the Fashion show mall is just across the street with a few good option for food, that makes it more relaxing then walk through the big casions.
We had high expectations for TRUMP International and we were disappointed. . . CONS:. . -The room prep coordinator came barging in without knocking or ringing.  She asked us when we were checking out and we had literally just arrived.. -No soap in the bathroom. -No slippers . -No welcome  chocolates. -Thick layer of dust all over the bedside table. -Small black hairs in the tub.  (We have very light brown hair). -My mom's room wasn't cleaned on the second day, even though we requested it. -Turn-down service was rescheduled until 9pm, but they still came at 7pm during our in-room dinner. -During in-room dining, they forgot to bring our ranch dressing and LOST the bill so we had to wait 10 minutes for both. -Train horn throughout the day and night.  Which woke me up both nights.. -One shower produced warm water, one only produced COLD water.  . -Doormen and women were uninterested in assisting us at times.  Other times they were helpful.  . -I signed my mom up for a SPA treatment and paid for with my credit card.  I offered 10% extra gratuity on top of the 20% mandatory because i am generous.  We handed the $25.00 dollar discount card prior her appt during check in (which is given to people staying in the hotel) and they never applied the discount to my VISA and charged the full price. . . . PROS:. . -The SPA treatment my mom had was very relaxing and nice, per my mom. . . . Overall, we had high expectations of Trump International.  We usually stay at other penthouse rooms or luxury hotels but we wanted to make Trump our go to hotel for many reasons.  One being that they offer a quiet and beautiful smoke-free environment.  The hotel is classy and is known to exceed expectations.  In our case, many of our expectations were barely met.  For someone who is involved in business, it was pretty clear that many of the situations we experienced at Trump International was caused by poor communication and lack of attention to detail.
comfy. 3 sets of elevators to speed up the process. great bathroom. tv in mirror. separate toilet & shower area. . close enough to the strip to get to everything easily, but far enough away to not be obnoxious.. . shuttle service was nice
I chose this hotel to get married in and spent a lot of money renting a suite and getting room service and so on and so forth. So many bad things happened while I was there and their team just completely ignored my many e-mails and phone calls. I was always transferred and hung up on. I couldn't believe that a hotel that I chose for my special day and that I spent almost 1,000 dollars on completely shunned me after I left. . . To mention a few: . -We were walked in on several times.. -They messed up our room service order several times. -One room service breakfast we had came with a broken coffee pot that spilled all over me and burned the crap out of me. -Urine in the toilet when we checked in. -Did not clean room when requested. -A very rude woman I had to keep dealing with at the front desk. . I was so flabbergasted for a hotel that carries a name that suggests elegance and good service.
Stayed here recently with my wife for a weekend getaway. We were given a high floor suite overlooking the strip, and with the way this hotel is situated, that means you can see straight down the strip all the way to Mandalay Bay and we could see the Bellagio fountains going off from our window. The room was very sleek modern "business class" and the bathroom was fantastic, with a TV in the mirror and a deep jacuzzi tub. My wife and I liked the fact that it is a non-smoking and non-gaming hotel and it is located right across the street from the Fashion Show shops, which is a great place to shop for clothes and gifts. The pool area is fantastic as well! We received great beverage service while taking in the views of the Wynn, Encore, and Pallazo hotels all afternoon. This is our favorite Vegas spot so far
If you like the bustling vegas scene then this wouldn't be the place for you. The trump is located in the back end of the strip and offers a free shuttle to Caesars palace and Wynn. . . The good: no cigarette smokes, spacious rooms, comfortable bed, location is close to everything on and off the strip, lobby smells amazing! Great customer service!. . The bad: only valet parking available -_- . . I would def. stay here again though!!
This may have been one of the best sleeps that I have ever gotten at a hotel. The double doors to get to your room help make it extra quiet, and you do not hear one door slam during the morning, (if you have been to a lot of hotels, you know how loud that can be--brutal!) . . The one down side that many are mentioning is the sound of the train in the middle of the night/early morning waking them up. I was woken up too at 5:30am from the train passing by, but I was dead tired that it did not bug me too much and I was off to sleep again in no time!. . The room was very large, and I could have just stayed here all day and ordered room service and I would have been the happiest gal ever!. . The bed and pillows were amazing and I sunk right into them. This being a 5 star hotel, there were plenty of upgrade in the room like a tv on the bathroom mirror, Jacuzzi tub, full bar/kitchen, STARBUCKS coffee to brew in the morning, and 3 music stations to choose from to make your stay even more relaxing. . . The room service menu was not as expensive as other 5 star hotels. We were tempted to order but we opted to eat on the strip so I cannot tell you about the food, but it looked great on the menu.. . The lobby is elegant, and absolutely beautiful. It is lightly perfumed and no smoking--Yahoo!. . We used the lovely free shuttle service from Trump to get onto the strip and back home which was great!
This is hands down the best hotel that I have ever been to in my life so far.  There may be better ones later on, but this tops the list for me right now.  We stayed in a studio room on a road trip to Burning Man this past year and the amenities and comfort of the room blew me away.. . The bed was extremely comfortable and everything within the room seemed very new and up to date.  The bathroom was definitely the show-stopper here.  A stand-in shower, TV built into the mirror, and large Jacuzzi tub made me almost just want to chill in the bathroom for a few hours, lol.  The room was spacious to say the least and it was more than enough for two people.. . I did not check out the other amenities, but did stop by the bar for a drink late at night.  The bartenders were classy and very knowledgeable about their cocktails.  They were able to recommend some great drinks just based off of a short conversation of what we generally liked. . . The only negative thing I could say about this place is its relative location on the Strip.  It is more or less at the very north-end of the Strip so it'll take some walking / cabbing to get to where you want to go.  If you're looking for sheer convenience in terms of getting around, you might want to consider another place more centrally located in the Strip.
Jasmine from room food service was the best thing to make my stay good. I called in advance to discuss food issues and she made sure that all my needs were met. The other services in the hotel were not up to par...housekeeping not great, took a long time for any requests. Restaurant couldnt get oder correct.. . 5 stars to Jasmine! . . Had to give 3 to hotel as the rest didnt do as well.
The rooms are good sized,  and well decorated. The beds are kind of hard, and there were not enough pillows for my taste. The staff is professional and helpful.  I'd say this is a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price. I would stay here again.
THE. BEST. HOTEL. IN. VEGAS. hands down!  We live in Los Angeles and come to Vegas often.  We have family and friends that live here, but this trip was to celebrate 3 friends birthdays from all over who were flying in to town.  There were 6 of us who chose Trump Hotel and we were all so happy we did.  Incredible service from the valet all throughout our weekend stay.  Best customer service ever.  The Rooms are insane with a small kitchenette, sub zero mini fridge, the most incredible jacuzzi tub I've ever been in, big rooms, comfortable beds, pet friendly, with dog walking services available, (our dog stayed at my moms this trip, but good to know for future), pool area is comfortable, day spa usage of steam and sauna,  FREE WiFi, Free shuttle to Wynn and Caesar's  Palace, great lobby bar, and the list goes on and on.  It's literally under a 5 min walk to the Strip, and directly across from Fashion Show Mall with Nordstrom at our front door from hotel..(heaven!). . . All who work here go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable.  Oh and every time we went to get our car, even at the busiest times, it was under 5 minutes.  . . I must admit when the internet blind deal popped up and showed us at Trump Hotel, I was bummed.  Thought it would be a bit on the cheese all side......but I was so happy to be proven wrong..... . We will definitely be staying here again and again and again......
We stayed for several days in the Trump Hotel, overall, it's a very nice hotel with great service, but with the noisy train directly next to the hotel and the lacking amenities, I feel this hotel could use a downgraded rating.  . . As I mentioned, the train was a huge issue for us, we stayed on the "mountain" side of the hotel, so we got loud horns every hour, sometimes twice an hour when the train passed through the street intersection.  The train horn is LOUD and pressed several times for probably one full minute, which was like getting an unwanted alarm clock at 3am, 4am, 4:40am, 5:20am, etc.   When checking out, we were told we can "upgrade" to the "Strip side" which doesn't have the train, but we'd also have to pay for it.  Really, we need to upgrade to get sleep??  . . Housekeeping service was a smidge slow when we asked for dishes (since most rooms have a kitchenette with nothing inside, not even drinking glasses), the pool is very small for the size of the hotel, and each time we went down (different days, off times, you name it), the entire seating area would be full or would have exactly one seat available. There are two jacuzzis, both are VERY small, and of course, one was not in use during our stay.  Keep in mind the elevators really hum/ cry during the night, so you may want to avoid a room too close to the elevators. . . Now the positives! Overall, the staff were very professional, courteous and quick.  The prices for room service were some of the most inexpensive I've seen on the Strip, and the food quality was very good.  Free valet parking (as all hotels have in LV) and there's no smoking anywhere in the hotel (HURRAH!!).  There's no casino, which was a perk for me, and it's in walking distance to the Fashion Show Mall, the Wynn, the Encore, etc.  The location worked very well for us & if there were no trains (or triple paned windows), this would've been a hotel I would come back to.
Nice hotel with low cost! The spa tub is fantastic! Nice staff and customer service! The mall is across the street. Sure it doesn't have the casino but it also make the hotel less noise than the others. I'd like to stay here when I come to vegas next time.
One of the best penthouse suites I've stayed in. . . The 3000 square foot penthouse was wonderful. The location of the trump is a bit off the beaten path but the room helped mitigate that. And although there is no casino at this hotel, that's no big deal. There are plenty of places to gamble on the Strip.. . This hotel is well appointed, the decorations are tasteful, and the hotel is very clean.. . We were well treated and everything was great. . . Would go here again.
