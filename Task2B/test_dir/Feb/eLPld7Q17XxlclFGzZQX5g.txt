GREAT sushi! I sat at the bar, chefs were very attentive and extremely friendly. Definitely plan on returning soon and with friends or family!
Seems like it's always crowded with out of towers. Its an AYCE sushi restaurant, which for me always sounds alarms. The fish was not that fresh and they were really fast on delivering sushi to you table. Which is good if you are hungry, but if you are trying to chat with your friends than forget about a peaceful conversation. . . There was an interesting incident that happened in front of our eyes. A homeless man walked into the restaurant, his jeans were torn as was his shirt. The server got him a table right across from our table and later got into a huge argument over the homeless man eating left over food from other people's plates. It was kind of embarrassing and sad, but the restaurant ended up kicking the guy out. And this is what I mean, when I say that their service was really fast and it seemed like getting customers, feeding them fast and serving new customers impacts their quality of customer service. Also, sushi quality needs a lot of improvement.
Very good sushiplace. You know it's a good place when it's packed at 10pm and there is a wait for a table. I liked the unique for variety of rolls. The staff was very fast and friendly.
Was introduced to this place about two weeks ago and have been thee twice! Really think the sushi is great and the service is pretty good. . The first time for dinner there was a good amount of people and the wait could be long. The location is good but the restaurant itself is kind of small. . Lunch is great. Prices are good! Suggest an all you can eat!
Another fantastic strip-mall restaurant in Vegas. The all-you-can-eat sushi is a great value, but they don't have any sashimi (fish only, no rice). Their rolls are creative and have interesting names to boot. Staff was very friendly and very pro-active about making sure our orders had arrived.
Today was the first time coming here and I wasn't all that thrilled. We ordered the "All you can you eat" and got our money's worth but service wise it sucked. The sushi was pretty fresh and tasty but you can't place orders with just any waitress, you have to place orders with the waitress assigned to your table. The service to me should be better must be better especially in a town that depends on the tourism industry. . . I don't know if it's purposely like this or just by coincidence but the employees who work there are mostly Asian and Mexican but there are no Mexican waiters/waitresses, they are the cooks, the water re-filler persons and the cooks, while the Asian people are the waiters/waitresses and front of house cooks. I'm not saying the owners of Yama Sushi did this on purpose but that's how the employee staff breaks down. . . This was my first time and sadly probably the last time.
Best sushi I have had so far in Vegas. Yes I know that's a little bit weird the best sushi in Vegas. They have several additions to the menu in the chichi me that allows more in flavorful infusion different types of spicy spices. Staff is very helpful in finding the perfect dish for your pallet. Tonight I had the jalapeno sashimi, it was very fresh and delicious. It did have some heat to it but well worth it. I can not express the freshness to the fish. Over all a wonderful dinning experience. Ps try the cucumber salad and the deep fried banana thing. Wow
Food was good but service was horrible. AYCE sushi for party of 5.  Took 15 mins for our for our first order and then found out they were out of both hamachi and salmon kama (one of the reasons we chose thus place) - then it was constant follow up on nearly everything ordered - they even forgot to bring wasabe and ginger when we finally had 3 rolls on the table... took an additional 5 mins to finally get those basic sushi essentials delivered - after asking. Additionally,  never once a smile from our two sour puss waitresses who seemed unhappy to work here... created significant stress for what should have been an enjoyable experience for my daughter's birthday... completely opposite from the great service we received at island sushi last week...  anyway, upon leaving, after paying the bill and explaining to our waitress why I only left her a $10 tip on a $125 bill, I spoke with the manager - who really seemed disinterested in hearing my opinion.  Bottom line : i won't be back and cannot in good conscience recommend to others...  wow, I'm all worked up again after reliving the experience so I'm downgrading from 2 stars to 1.
Visited Yama Sushi on Valentines Day to have a low key dinner with my girl cousins to catch up. I had heard how Yama was great from them and decided to give them a try. I will have to say probably not the best time to visit this place but I did. . . The restaurant is a clean and pretty big. They had four sushi chefs when I was there I figured that it would be enough. I know being valentines day it was going to be busy but it was just not enough to be overwhelmed like that.  . . The sushi chef kept skipping us! At first I thought maybe because I was hungry and ready for more. But then my party started to notice too. He took two new clients orders first two times before he got to ask one of our party if they were ready and then seemed to forget about our order PERIOD! The busboy staff where GREAT! They were very attentive and friendly. I have always had great service from sitting at a sushi bar not so much here. . . At one point the chef lightly bumped into the mini sushi fridges where they store the fish and the roll just completely unraveled and spilled over to us. He even stated that it wasn't him bumping into the area so much as the roll not being made right. I was actually amazed he said that out loud because I was thinking it. We ordered three "Palm Jobs" three times and waited more than 30 minutes for it and he forgot about it all three times.  I gave up on my order and only one of us patiently waited again ONLY  after she got up and went over to him since he had already switched position to the other part of sushi bar ! I was over it.. . I really want to say I would be back to give them a second chance but freshness and flavor were off as well. Something I did see was that a lot of their fish is . PRE-SLICED!  I haven't  seen that in a sushi bar  and thought It was off.... . . I did learn how to order everything sexy style which is with Avocado, jalapeno, and thin slice of lemon and a lemon sauce that I wish was Yuzu sauce. . . I will stick with my regular sushi spot.
I've been here 2 times! Awesome both times, just make sure u dont expect amazing raw fish quality...it was realllly good and some fish taste better than others, but overall I really enjoyed this place... so much I went a year later remembering how good it was.
Always a gamble trying different AYCE sushi places.  Since this one was highly recommended by a friend, we decided to give it a go!. . As a positive, I noticed the service was very fast and efficient...food orders came out quickly, orders were taken, drinks refilled, etc.. . But the quality and cuts were not very impressive.  And they added a very sweet ponzu to a lot of the nigiri...distracting actually.  Perhaps to hide the quality of fish?. . The ahi / tuna nigiri I was served was actually embarrassing...I didn't even take a photo of it LOL.  Just a really rough cut, poor coloring, and did not taste fresh even during a fully-packed night.. . The amaebi was not cut/butterflied like all others I've had before, so it was a bit chewy and didn't melt in your mouth.. . The uni was also runny in consistency.  Besides the sake / salmon, I didn't really taste anything "fresh" in my opinion.. . I just wasn't impressed with anything here....but I found plenty to be underwhelmed. . . Good luck!
This has got to be the best AYCE sushi place hands down; and I can't find one of comparison in Cali maybe except Sudachi in San Fran(no AYCE though).
The first time I came here was March of 2010 with my best friends (4 other girls) and we all loved it.  We stumbled upon it by mistake, I think we might have seen an advertisement for it either that or we yelped it.  I just remember the interesting names of the rolls (manwhore roll, sticks out the most loll) and the fact that everything we ate was delicious.  . . So why the two star review?  Fast forward to edc weekend 2013 and I came here again with my boyfriend.  I was telling him about how good this place was because I had it before.  He loves sushi, and he's very picky about his sushi places.  This time around, it just was not good anymore.  I think it is because this time we focused more on nigiri rather than rolls and the fish is NOT fresh at all and they pack on so much rice.  The rolls are still good, but I mean anything is going to taste good if it's deep fried and smothered in spicy mayo.  The 2010 version of me did not try the nigiri, just rolls cause I did not really eat a lot of nigiri back then, just rolls.  The 2013 version of me though, will probably not come back here.  The fish is old and horrible, and I was happy I did not get a tummy ache because that would have ruined my edc plans.  . . Oh and I like to eat my fish first before I eat the rice because I actually enjoy the taste of sushi rice.  So I had a little rice pile on my plate that I was planning on eating.  The waitress comes by and tells me that because it is all you can eat, I have to eat the rice too.  I understand that she is just doing her job, but that irritated me a little bit.
The AYCE is an amazingly great deal! Definitely one of the best I've had because all specialty rolls are part of the deal. The Man Whore was awesome. Some old reviews said the service wasn't great, but I went two nights in a row and had great service at the bar and at a table. . . The muscles are yummy too!
I really like this place!
