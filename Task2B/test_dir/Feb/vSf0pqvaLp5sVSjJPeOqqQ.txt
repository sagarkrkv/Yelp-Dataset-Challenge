Very disappointing. We enjoyed Olive and thought we'd try this new place and it is no where close to the same quality. Great beer on tap selection but the chicken pot pie was just a step above acceptable with a thick biscuit top rather than the flaky pastry top normally used. The chicken seemed like it was cut months ago and very little vegetables. Not what I expected and apparently the same for others as it was virtually empty on a Friday evening. Wings special appetizer wasn't bad, but the Bleu Cheese dressing was only OK. Go to Olives if you need an English fix!
Todd English is a diamond in the rough!  I was traveling solo and staying at the Aria.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a place with a bar that I could pull up and take a seat.Excellent wings, salad, and beer choices.. . The staff is also a highlight of this place.  I look forward to going back next time I'm in town.
The junk fries and the lobster salad were to die for. Been there twice this trip and they are fantastic! The bad: draft beer is $10 each.
4.5 stars, but rounding up because Todd English is a welcome change of pace from the rest of the restaurants and nonsense around the strip. . . Had a great time there, superb beer menu unlike many slightly more snobby pubs on the Strip. Beers from around the world and a healthy variety of small craft brews. I had a couple different ones while I was there and will definitely try more when I go back. . Had the duck buns for my appetizer and they were delicious. I realize this kinda contradicts the overall tone of this review that it was nice to have some pub food as duck buns aren't really what you'd expect from a pub, but somehow they fit well. The meat was delicious, well cooked and the buns were great as well. . . Had the tacos for my entree and they were superb. Just delicious, nothing like some tacos and beer for a dinner. The tacos had this tasty and creamy but not overly heavy sauce on them which was maybe the best part. All too many places also overload with cabbage and such but that wasn't the case at all at Todd English. . . Again, I think the thing I like most about Todd English is that it was almost like an escape from the Strip, just the overall atmosphere was a pleasant departure. And the food and beer were great. Would definitely go back!
Food: excellent. Service: excellent. Location: Can't be beat. Our server was awesome, the food was great.  The junk chips(huge portion- a 10!), lobster rolls, and brisket plate were all very tasty.  Near the entrance of Aria leading to great people watching.  Pass on the wings... Not that great and definitely not crispy as advertised.  The second day we showed up at 3pm it was happy hour- 1/2 price drafts and $1 wings and $2 sliders.  We ate it up.  At the end of our visit, the sever gave us each a small cup of his favorite brew.  Busboy was off the chain good prompting us to tip him as well.  You can smell the great management in this place.  All in all, it's rather spendy but commensurate with the area.  Still a great restaurant with fantastic service.
This place has a fun atmosphere and decent happy hour prices. The food isn't a steal but the servers are friendly and clearly enjoy working there. The have a couple fun things that I have not seen at a restaurant before. You can sit at a table near the bar and have your own beer taps at the table that just keep track of how much you have had to drink. They also have some hourglass timers at the bar that if you can finish a beer in less than 7 seconds its free (up to two beers). If you are chosing between slightly overpriced and generic spots to grab a drink this one tops the rest!
Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me. Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free.
From a 1 being horrible and a 5 being awesome:. . Food - 2. Service - 4. Atmosphere - 2. Price - 1. . The food here was pretty bad and paying 3x what it was worth made it taste a lot worse.
Come for the great draft beer selection and the tuna burger. Make sure you ask for Chris as your server, he was awesome!
OK I know Vegas has a lot of great places to eat. Here is another one. The bartender and the food couldnt ask for better services and food. Tuna tarta great start. Anything on the menu is great. My GF ate there all week.
I actually had my wedding dinner here after our ceremony. It was an unusual choice but i wanted something casual and near our hotel. This seems liked the place. They had a catering menu we ordered off, it wasn't cheap, but they provided enough food for everyone and everything for the most part was decent. I would say it was a couple steps up from bar food. The best thing was they made our wedding cake, which was $75, cute, feed all 20 of us and was delicious!!!! (red velvet with cream cheese frosting). I probably wouldnt come here again next time were in Vegas just due to all the different places to try, but if you want an upscale bar with food, you should check them out.
Good bar food.  The beer flights were somewhat interesting and overpriced.  I'd prefer if I could choose the flights rather than having a Pabst blue ribbon.  . . The pastrami sandwich came unassembled: pastrami, bread, mustard, and pickles on separate plates.  very tasty!. . Not all the seats have good views, I was stuck behind a big pillar.  Luckily the waitress was friendly enough to switch the only tv I could see over to a NBA game.  . . good food, good beer, good service, and good entertainment is the meaning of life.  . . there was a lady in the washroom who provided nothing but annoyance.  I dislike the concept of bathroom attendants with a passion.  not once has an attendant provided any service I couldn't get without them.
Yes. This is a great place for slightly higher quality bar food.  The portions are large and the service is great.. . This was a pre-concert spot to satisfy hunger and booze needs and it did the job.  A great spot for large groups, I believe happy hour specials as well.. . Lobster Roll for the win! . . I highly recommend checking out this spot, you will be happy.
Located behind the front desk at the Aria Resort & Casino, The Pub is Todd English's take in the gastropub, which seems to be the hot thing in Vegas at the moment, if not the whole country. . The establishment is well set up with ample seating inside and outside, with the latter being next to the flower bed and rock sculpture. Inside, there is an enormous bar surrounding a huge wall of alcohol, with drinks, food and other specials listed on blackboards. They also have an hour glass rotator spaced evenly throughout the bar seating, but more on that later. . . The place has 70 different types of beer on hand from various regions, including Belgium and the United States, along with Trappist beer made by monks. . . While there are other locations in Vegas that offer 100, any beer aficionado will find something they like. However, the star of the show in my opinion is the TE Bloody Mary. It's probably the best BM I've had in a long time, with a generous amount of spice and kick to really get the senses going. It comes with a variety of accouterments, including pickled carrots, green beans, olives and cheddar cheese. This drink is a nice beverage and meal rolled into one. I would recommend this to anyone stopping by here, it's that good!. . The food on the other hand is hit or miss. While they claim to have a raw bar, I felt it really missed the mark, with the oysters improperly shucked and not very fresh. It was the biggest disappointment as I am a huge fan and was hoping to have something close to satisfy that craving. . . I also ordered their hot dog, which was okay. Look wise, it's a beast, at a whopping  foot long (possibly bigger) and more than enough for two people. The dog was split a third of the way down to fill it with cheddar cheese which was a nice touch. The brioche bun also took this American staple to a higher level but that's where it really ends. While the bun was nice and soft, the meat to bread ratio was grossly off, opting for big and large presentations over taste. The sausage also didn't have the kind of snap I was looking for. It may have been different with the chili and onion option but I don't think another $5 addition to an already expensive meal ($20) was worth it. . . Not bad by any means but definitely not great. . . The hour glass at the bar however, is super interesting, especially if you are coming with friends. The 7 second hour glass challenge allows daredevils to down a beer before the sand runs out. Those that are successful get their beer for free and you can do this twice a day. Pretty sweet for those looking for a raucous good time. . . Overall, an okay spot but nothing I haven't seen or experienced elsewhere.
Just stopped in for a pint. The bartender was friendly while giving me tastes, but the beer was wildly overpriced & the atmosphere was eclectic almost to the degree of headache inducing. Not a bar for beer lovers.
The Vibe: A pub and restaurant so you get the benefit of both!!  It's crazy on the weekends since they offer this "drink a pint in 7 seconds and it's free" deal.  It's a trendy pub, not traditional and not divey.. . The Attire: It's at Crystals Shopping complext, which means $$$$.  So you could dress low key, but may feel a tad out of place.  More like Business casual.  But woman will need to dress "sexy casual" to feel they fit in.. . Consider: They offer loads of European craft beer, so that's a plus, but don't expect anything offered by local breweries.  Also, the location makes this place an expensive option.  It's a beautiful pub, and on low key times like late weeknights, it's easy to get a seat and have some great convo with the bartenders!
Has officially become our first or second stop when in town--2013 has seen me visit Vegas 8 different times, so this place definitely receives my loyalty!. . This place is a trendy version of an English pub so you have your traditional pub fare with a luxurious twist. They also have a good selection of craft beer from all around the world, and a "7 second challenge"--finish a pint in 7 seconds or less and it's on the house. I've tried it twice with a 50% success rate (pro tip, try one of the cream ales such as boddington's, belhaven, or guinness). . Will continue coming here unless this place takes a nosedive--something tells me that won't be the case.. . Cheers!
The food was okay at best-had a 4 shrimp cocktail appetizer and fish and chips. My bill was over $50 -has to be the most overpriced place that I've eaten in Vegas for the quality which was fair at best I would avoid this place other than for a beer.
Bad food and expensive beer. The fries were way too salty and pretzels were super greasy. Won't come back.
