I like Cirque du Soleil so everytime I go to Vegas I try to watch one show. O show is the most famous one so you'd gonna watch once. The show itself is beautiful, make sure you get good seats, front view. I paid $150 + taxes for the show, the seats are pretty good. The clowns are pretty entertaining, they come before and middle of the show. Why 4 stars? Because O show doesn't have any story lines, it is major acrobats. And maybe I'm from China, I have seen so many acrobats,these acrobats do not look amazing to me.  It didn't WoW me. So I think it is a bit over priced, in this case, I prefer KA show and it is a bit cheaper.
Totem, O, Mystere, Zumanity, LOVE, ONE, serously any of the Cirque du Soleil shows are a hit. They house some of the most creative imaginative people in the world! If you want to be taken away and mystified into a dream world then goto a Cirque du Soleil show. They travel around too with smaller shows, but in Las Vegas they have ongoing performances all year round that are gigantic and glitzy. . . It's perfect for families, no nudity or anything, just lots of talent and creativity channeled to the audience. I've been privileged to goto Cirque du Soleil shows throughout my entire life, I can honestly say that they still impress me even now as a full grown adult as much as they did when I was 9. . . Tickets are expensive, but there are a lot of third party ticket vendors in Las Vegas, so your chances of getting a slightly discounted ticket are high! Just ask around and stay alert. Zumanity is very sensual, maybe you wouldn't want to bring your kids to that one. O is geared towards a broader audience from kids to adults. It's a family show.
Ya know I gotta say I was a little disappointed with the show. Previously having seen The Beatles Love show, and knowing how awesome Cirque is...I found O to be a bit of a snoozefest. . . It's beautiful alright, but it seemed like they repeated alot of the same movements and dives. . . I'm giving them 3 stars for talent. Because lets face it, those performers are absolutely incredible. However, the story and music wasn't as mind blowing as i'd hoped. . . Perhaps if the tickers were $30 pp I would recommend it. But at $184 pp I would say skip it and go see something else. Or throw the $ at a nice dinner.
I'm giving this 4 stars because the performers are top notch.. . But I was glad it was over. I felt I have seen better at shows such as KA and Mystere, even Ovo & Totem.. . Big production and staff is great, but intimate settings are better.. . For the price you pay here I would pay for KA and this is just expensive for being Bellagio. Let's just face the fact that it's the location.. . For what the price you pay, I wanted to be wowed, Cirque Du Soleil does wow me, but this show didn't probably because some of the show is repeated.. . I'm glad I saw it with my own eyes, now I can say I have seen it an was just ok with the performance.
I've seen this show a few times and always leave the theater amazed.  So much goes on above water, that you don't realize the amount of work that goes on underwater as well.
I strive to be comprehensively balanced on my reviews, but still it may come as a surprise to many that I'm giving 'O' only 3 stars (well actually 3.5... well now actually 4... see at the end). . There's a saying in Vegas, not "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."  Another saying something like, "We're in Vegas, lets go back some 'bad' decisions."  Cirque 'O' is probably the BEST bad decision you can make in Vegas in my opinion.. . The show itself is 4.5 stars in my book.  The missing half star is because for me, the 'WOW' factor was not quite what I expected for the price of the ticket and the hype from all the other reviewers.  But nonetheless, the show can be appropriately described as spectacular.  One criticism I have is the stage is VERY deep so it can be hard to make out the characters in the back of the stage.  A small pair of binoculars (if you are sitting in back) would be a great tool to fully enjoy the amazing costumes.  Also I caution, that I would not recommend sitting in the first dozen or so rows.  Much of the show takes place high in the air, and you will have a much better perspective sitting about mid-way back.. . So why only 3.5 stars?  The price.  Yes, yes, I know, everything in Vegas is about 80% overpriced nowadays.  It's the law of supply and demand and the theme of 'excess' rampant throughout the town.  But to me, that's no excuse for a mediocre value, and that is what 'O' is.  For $170 per person (unless you sit in the balcony or get a partially obstructed view) for a 1.5 hour show, it IS described at BEST a MEDIOCRE value.  That's $680 for a family of four.  You can do quite a few more interactive and cool and longer lasting activities for $680 for a family of four.  Think about it.. . If money is virtually no object, 'O' is a no brainer.  But if you like to get some decent value for your entertainment dollar, you can maximize it with Cirque by managing your expectations going in which I didn't and that was my mistake and the partial fault of many other reviewers which seemingly have a lower 'amazement threshold' than myself.  To each their own though.. . So where did I sit you ask?  After careful consideration, we chose the first row of the balcony and it was a good decision (yes I know it may be ironic I'm complaining about the value when I bought the $40 cheaper seats - but I'm writing the review considering the vast majority of the seats are the higher price.)  You will have to lean forward to look over the railing to see things that are happening in the very front of the stage and in the crowd.  The perspective is great, you are at eyes level with much of the show in the air and have a good perspective on the deeper area of the stage and see some of the synchronized swimming moves from a better elevated perspective, I would NOT sit in the balcony in any other row though as there is occasional action in the crowd below that is fun to watch that you can't see from the other rows in the balcony.  I think the best seats would be the first few rows of the "second/upper orchestra section" in the middle on either side of the controller area or the center of the Loggia (lower single row balcony). . . I'm a music lover and an MJ fan.  The music in 'O' was great but I think it could have been more exciting.  I honestly think I would probably enjoy the more immersive musical experience of Michael Jackson The One.  . . I was about to hit submit with 3-stars rating but decided to round up realizing many readers may not realize that 3-star rating has a lot to do with value and isn't just a rating for the show itself so I've decided to weight it on the show itself and avoid the backlash of the others drunk on the Cirque Cool-Aid.
This is a show I rant and rave to everyone about.  It truly is a piece of beauty and art.  The stage alone deserves a 5 star review because it is simply amazing.  . . The show has a great balance of mediums with acrobatics, dancers, synchronized swimmers, and the list goes on and on.  . . Highlights include:. Everything!. . Low point:. Nothing!
An Aquatic Masterpiece!. Breathtaking!!. Simply The Best!!!. . Short Review:  . This was my first Cirque show in Las Vegas and I gots to say....I had the time of my life. We watched "O" for Valentine's Day and the experience was breathtaking from start to finish.  There's no sense going to great detail of what you'll experience with this show since most of the reviews on here already explain a lot.  Bottom line, Cirque du Soleil's "O" is as good as it gets.. . Shorter Review:. Do This!. . Longer Review: . Cirque du Soleil's "O" is performed in Bellagio.  "O", French for water, features at least 10 different acts in water, on the ground, and in the air.  You'll experience acts from acrobats, trapeze acts, fire dancing, contortionist, high dives, synchronized swimming, and even some clowns perform. All acts are performed with live music, which is perfectly synchronized with all of the performances. It's really hard to say which of the acts was my favorite because all delivered a performance that's simply magical.  You have to hand it to all the performers.  The strength, the focus, and the grace that these performers exhibit is second to none. I look forward to watch more Cirque shows in the future and will consider the backstage package for "O" as well.  But don't just take my word for it, check out "O" for yourself.  . . . TIP: "O" performs Wednesday through Sunday with only two performances, 7:30 PM and 10:00 PM.  You can get tickets at one of M Life's casinos (ie. Excalibur, Luxor, Bellagio, etc) or online.  Unless you have a hook up, general admission per person starts at $108 for Level 4, $119.90 for Level 3, $143 for Level 2, and $170.50 for Level 1.  Because it was my first time and didn't know what to expect, we got seats at Level 1. However, the theater isn't too big and is set up perfectly.  In other words, I think that you can still enjoy the show from Level 4. . . . YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (049/366)
Breathtaking, amazing performances, super talented cast, simply awesome! An amazing Valentine's present :*). . My boyfriend and I sat 5 rows from the front and got to see every small detail that were put into the production. It was so magical to see an aquatic show brought to life. I still can't get over how amazing the set and production was. A breathtaking 1.5-2 hour show!. . The only downfall was of course, the price. This show is probably one of, if not the most expensive in Vegas. The stage was huge but the theatre itself was pretty small, which means that you would probably still get the full experience purchasing the Level 3-4 tickets. Also, each row of seats drop pretty low so you are not blocked by the person in front of you. . . Would definitely love to see this again! . . A+!
Got to see this show recently and it was awesome! While my favorite is still Zarkana,   this show takes place mostly in the water and that in itself is unique! . . We were lucky to get 2nd row seating , aka the splash zone, but it actually wasn't bad at all. Seems like the clowns are in every single cirque show and they were actually funny in some parts. A lot of diving from extremely high points...(don't know how they can do that @@) dancing underwater in sync with each other. . . Overall, I can only say that these performers are super talented and its a must see show in the cirque du soleil series. I'll be taking my parentswhen they come to visit!
One word: Breathtaking
Amazing. Everywhere you look there is something new to see, something else to dazzle you, and a side story. Honestly I couldn't pick up on an overlying story other then a man chasing a woman (he loves I presume). I get the feeling of through a dreamscape- but I could be wrong. Honestly I get lost in subtlety so don't let that bias you. The show is stunning! The acrobatics are fantastic. The high dives leave you squealing. There's comical scenes, creepy scenes, intense scenes (pyrotechnics!) and amazing displays of physical feats at every turn. I've seen it twice now, once from the very back nose bleed section and once front row. There is not a bad seat in the house, and there is always something new you didn't see before. And don't let the idea of the stage being water deter you from the physical strengths and intensity of the show- different parts of the stage moves so that not always are the aero acrobatics safely going to land in a pool of they fall....
I've been a fan of Le Cirque since their beginning in Santa Monica as Le Theatre du Soleil. I've seen many shows, and loved them all. This is why it is sad for me to rate this show so low, as it is actually another great show, which I was extremely disappointed in not being able to enjoy, as all my friends and family, since we were blinded half the time by the powerful backstage spotlights, aimed right at our seats.. DO NOT SEAT in the Balcony area!. You'll be blinded by the 1,000 watts projectors and leave with a throbbing headache. How can this be? Why this this bad lighting design still in place after 15 years? It's shameful for Le Cirque to let this happen. Honteux. Lamentable.
Amazing, breathtaking performances. I don't think there was a bad seat in the house, either. I sat towards the left side (if you're facing the stage) and man. What a sight. This show was definitely worth every penny I spent to purchase the tickets. If you only have the chance to see one Cirque show in your life - let it be this one! You will not regret it.
Although "O" isn't my favorite Cirque show, it definitely deserves a 5-star rating.  With incredible aquatics, acrobats, and an impressive set (seriously, how did they do that??), I highly recommend.  It was a little on the "circus" side in terms of story line (high divers, a girl on a trapeze while on her head, synchronized swimming), but overall, very impressive.  Oh, and the clowns were even funny for a change (not just cheesy!).. . My favorite Cirque shows thus far are Mystiere & Beatles Love, but "O" is right up there, definitely in front of Amaluna, Ka and another I can't remember now.
