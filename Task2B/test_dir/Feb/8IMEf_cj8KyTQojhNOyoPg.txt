Beware, it's cheap for a reason. At it's best, it mediocre, at it's worst, it's complete garbage. I've been here several times, but this will be the last.. . Let's start with check-in. They never have enough people at the check in desk, so enjoy a long wait. Also, if you booked a king bed, be prepared to fight for it as they never have any. They pull this:. . Clerk: You wanted non-smoking?. Me: Yes. Clerk: We have no more kings in non-smoking.. Me: Fine, smoking then.. Clerk: Oh, we actually don't have any kings in smoking either.. Me: But I paid for a king suite.. Clerk: Yeah, you should have been here sooner.. . BTW, this was 3:15, :15 after check-in times, and that was after :15 wait in line. When they pull this, if you want your room, you need to make a scene. They have the king, they just want you to take the double. If you ask for the manager and threaten to write a Yelp review with his name in it, you'll get your room. They lie.. . Let's talk the room itself. Think less nice hotel, and more fair motel. Dated is a word one reviewer used. I prefer the term, garage sale. The furniture kinda matches. And the art on the wall was clearly picked out, and painted by a blind person. . Let's talk minibar. Three dollar cans of coke no longer shock me, but three dollar cokes in the hallway vending machine kinda does. Also, cans, not bottles. One nice thing here is they have a minifridge in the room, so BYO(whatever) and save a bit. Also, beware the juice in the minibar. Check those dates on the bottle or you may have a nasty surprise like I did. . . Moving on the Internet: Did you enjoybrowsing AOL in '96? Then you'll love browsing at the Rio! When it works. And if you call the number for assistance, be prepared for a pointless conversation with a think accented Indian named "Jeff". Tip: Use Chrome to connect initially here. Every other browser chokes on the load up page. I swear that's the only way I get it to work.. . No complaints about the beds, other than they could use an upgrade. . . Room service is not too slow, which is good, since the food is not worth the wait. The Caesar salad is about as lifeless as the man himself, and the rest of the menu is uninspired. Seriously, it's the worst room service food I've had in Vegas, keep in mind, I live here. . . The restaurants are sub-par at best. The All-American Bar and Grille is where the room service comes from, so eating there is like going to see a band who's CD sucked, with the added benefit of fairly rude servers. KJ Dim Sum and Seafood falls somewhere between Panda Express and PF Changs, except at higher prices and worse service. I will say this, the servers are entertaining. The "walls" in the restaurant are portable, kinda, and I watched three servers try to rearrange them. It was like an Asian episode of The Three Stooges. The walls collapsed on them twice. . . We'll talk gaming. I'm not a big gambler, but I'll occasionally throw $20 - $40 into a machine after dinner because I'm too dumb not to. Remember when we talked about the1996 Internet? Well that's the last time this place purchased a new machine. Those cool touch screen machines that all other casinos have? Well, they keep it old school here. Also, worst odds and tightest slots anywhere in town. Why do you think the room's are so cheap? . . And management: Here's the thing, I live here. So these places to me are not just vacation spots, I frequent them. So when something is not right, I'll let them know. I try to be cool about it, as I know whatever problem I'm having is not the direct fault of the person I'm speaking to. Usually what happens is a decent conversation about the problem, they comp me something small, admit they could do better in that area and we part buddies. I have never seen more apathetic management than those at the Rio. They seem like the place could burn to the ground and they wouldn't care. Seriously, everyone from the cocktail waitresses right up to the managers act like they were drafted to work here and can't wait to be released. . . Case in point: I called down because the Internet, that I paid for, was down. I asked to speak to a manager and after 10 minutes on hold and calling back twice, was told there was nothing they could do. That's cool, not in that the Internet was down, but I get that if it's their service provider, not much the manager can do other than call them. So the manager apologized (kinda). I asked if I could get a refund on the Internet since it's not working. He said sure and that he'll just refund my Resort Fee. That was three weeks ago, and still nothing. . . In short, not worth the money. It may seem cheap, but you'll end up paying more and getting less than other, nicer casinos. Hope this helps.
Booked a comped room through Total Rewards for a Monday night. Arrived early and changed reservation to Sunday easily and with no fee. FREE UPGRADE TO PREMIUM SUITE UPON CHECK-IN. Comped resort fee upon check-out. . . Because of all of the above, the Rio get 5 stars from me. Customer service and front desk staff were fantastic. Check in / out were fast because I was in the Total Rewards line.. . I last stayed at the Rio more than 10 years ago. I had not been there in many years, and my expectations were low, so I was pleasantly surprised. Self parking was fast and easy. The casino atmosphere was nicer than I expected. Decent shops and food options. The suite was nice and the bathroom was huge. My only critique is though the bath tub looked clean, when I filled it there were quite a few hairs visible in the water. I showered instead. . . A very pleasant stay. Thanks Rio.
Rio is a great hotel that has recently been refabbed and cheaper than hotels on the strip.  Like I said, it is off the strip, but I walked back from the stip one day and it really wasn't a long walk.  Great hotel, with cool people and decent nightspots.  Certainly not upscale, but still very nice.
Great rooms and service was very friendly and helpful. Easy to get to the strip from here. Dealers were friendly too.
Decided to try the Rio this past weekend for my fiance's surprise birthday trip, and was extremely disappointed. . . I don't really enjoy leaving bad reviews, so I'll keep it short with why I would never stay again:. . The shower pressure was HORRIBLE! I'm not sure what the plan was here but the water barely came out and what did come out, just came out all half-assed and made it pretty difficult to shower comfortably without having to be directly under the shower head for water. I uploaded a photo so you can kind of see what I'm talking about. . . Like another reviewer mentioned, the WiFi here was also horrible! Dial-up like speeds is an understatement. Why charge for it, if you can't even access it? I ended up having to be connected to their IT people for about 20 minutes before thy finally ended up resetting their port connection to finally get it to work the day before we left. . . Checking out was a nightmare trying to use my Total Rewards balance to pay for my resort fees. I continuously showed the reception lady emails showing I had a balance and she couldn't help me unless I went to go sort it out at the TR desk.. . Yes, the rooms are a bit bigger compared to rooms on the strip, but they definitely look a bit outdated. The only other thing we did like was the free shuttle over to Harrah's or Bally's every 30 minutes if you want to go walk/drink without having to drive. . . Other than that, it's definitely worth more money to just stay on the strip...
We chose to stay at the Rio Hotel & Casino because it was inexpensive and we wanted to see the Penn and Teller show. We were not disappointed. My boyfriend and I checked into the Rio at 8pm on Saturday night. The self parking garage was easy to navigate and convenient. We parked on the top floor of the garage which had a beautiful view of the strip, and there were plenty of parking spaces available on a Saturday night. We waited in a very short line to check in. The front desk had us in a room with 2 queen beds and, when I stated that we had requested a king bed, they quickly switched us into a room with a king.. . We stayed in a deluxe room in the Ipanema tower. It was a spacious and clean room with a king bed, desk, sofa and coffee table, large flat screen TV, mini-fridge, and a private bathroom and vanity area that was nicely separated from the rest of the room. There was a Kuerig coffee machine (with coffee pods for sale in the minbar for about $3 or $4 each) and a mini bar which we never even opened. We had a tremendous view of the strip from our room overlooking the Rio pool area. The pool was closed, but it was February and most of the pools in Vegas are closed in the winter. There was a free shuttle to the strip that drops off at the Paris/Bally's or the Harrah's casinos. We waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle each way and were pleased with the service. We didn't gamble or try any of the restaurants at the Rio, although we did get coffee each morning at the Starbucks on the ground floor of our tower.. . The Penn and Teller show was top notch and the theater was really nice!. . Cons: The internet in our room was equipped with ethernet cables which we were unable to use since we had iPhone and iPad devices. There may have been wi-fi, but we couldn't seem to access or sign into it so we gave up and just used our iPhone service. There were no usb ports in the room for charging devices either, and we neglected to bring one since most of the nicer hotels have charging ports in the lamp bases, etc. The $20 resort fee seems ridiculous, but even the crappiest hotels on the strip have a "resort" fee, so we just accepted it as part of the real price of the room.. . Overall, we would definitely stay at the Rio hotel again. We enjoyed staying off the strip because it was easier to navigate traffic and parking, and more intimate and quieter than the strip. I hope, after reading other reviews, that our next experience here will be just as good as our first. We're not that picky, but we like things to be clean, comfortable, and convenient, and that is what the Rio provided.
We were in town for a wedding. Got a good deal on our room on Expedia.  The room, where dated, was huge and pretty nice.  I didn't notice a problem with the WiFi as some did, but I think the resort fee is a little high for what you get.  We went to the spa and had massages that were just OK, but the spa is nice, they have a good selection of juice, clean hot tub and steam room.  Took advantage of the spa area twice while we were there since it's included with the resort fee.  The spa attendent Collyn was super sweet and attentive and even gave me a little bag with some samples in it for my birthday along with a birthday balloon!. . All American Bar & Grill was pretty good in the middle of the night when we got back from gambling.  Went to Hash Hash a Go Go twice for breakfast, this was pretty good.  Voodoo Steak was delish.  There is enough to do at the Rio that we didn't even go to the Strip during the two days we were there.  Will stay here again.
I went to the Rio Buffet in July 2011, fresh with a buffet day pass and ready for the excess of Las Vegas. The Rio even beat the Belagio, mainly due to the options being infinite while the Belagio's quality was maintained. At the Rio, during every given moment, you can get anything you want, even when a chef is required. . . The buffet goes for as long as a large New York City street block. There is constant seating and you, mark my words, will pile up that plate. Going to the Rio is the perfect tribute to Las Vegas excess that earns it the "Sin City" nickname.. . Rio's portions and quality are to no end.
So far, check in line the longest I have seen at any hotel. The pool and stay was good though.
Stopped in for a little gambling, Voodoo Steak, and Penn & Teller = great night! The casino area and property are gorgeous yet comfortable and fun. Good ventilation in the casino, did not walk out smelling like an ashtray, hurray! Friendly helpful staff.
I stayed several days at the Rio for a trade show, overall it was OK to "meh".  The rooms are clean but dated, they charge you for every little thing (as does most hotels in Las Vegas), the location isn't the best (it's definitely OFF Strip).  The amenities left a lot to be desired -- the pool was being painted (even though I was there all week saw zero work being done each time I passed by), the spa isn't super impressive.  Food is just "meh," as is the super smokey casino (have you guys heard of ventilation?!).. . I did think the staff was just "so-so", especially the reception staff.  While checking in, I was called "sir" (ehm, ok), she apologized and said it was "habit" when greeting her guests.  Another gal said right away "Whoa, SOMEONE'S sensitive," which took me by surprise.  Suddenly, I felt like it was high school or the trailer park, couldn't figure out which one.. . Free valet parking (as most hotels in LV are), they charge you a "resort fee" if you want to use the pool, and internet is $13.95 per day, per device.  They nickle and dime you to death, but every hotel in LV does this, so be prepared.. . The perks: there's a great "Wine Cellar" wine bar downstairs that has lovely wines to choose from and a sassy older lady that'll keep you on your toes.  The Voodoo lounge on the 50th floor wasn't open, but the view was impressive and isn't for the anxiety-ridden.  Nice martini's in the Voodoo steak house.  Zero to eat if you are vegetarian.
