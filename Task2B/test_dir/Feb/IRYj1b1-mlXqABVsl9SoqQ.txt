Let me help you understand how good this place actually is. I don't normally like Mexican food. It isn't my preferred food category, but this place was so good. Everything was cooked in front of me and everything was spot on. It definitely hit the spot for that late afternoon hangover.
Street tacos - fantastic! You walk in the door and the grill smoke greets your nostrils and you begin to salivate. Service is fast and friendly, food is fresh and delicious -- and inexpensive. A great option on the strip.
Food was good not great. Very authentic. Two lines one for spicy pork the other for beef and innards yes correct. Local Hispanic population mainly so I know authentic. . It's very chaotic and know what you want when you get to front of line!!!!! Server will not help you order so be prepared for that. . Limited seating for size of crowd. I attempted to eat in outside seating and helper looked at me like 'don't you see there is no available seating?". This place is popular I believe because it's the ONLY place in town so they know if want this you don't have any other choice.
Being a fan on Tacos el Gordo now, i wanted to try their Strip location, located a little north of the Wynn Casino. You may or may not pass it the first time but once you pass Wynn, and the little overpass (desert inn), there is a parking lot that leads to a Church . You can either park here (before Tacos el Gordo) or park in the lot after passing the restaurant. The restaurant itself faces Las Vegas Blvd, so not hard to spot it if you are looking for it.. . Unlike the Charleston location, this location also has outdoor seating. Something different from the other location as well, they have double the amount of lines, but as you can probably guess.... this location can be MUCH MUCH busier. But if you want tongue/stomach, i think there is only ONE line for that (far right off to the side). . . First time i came here, mid day, not really busy at all. Later few times, were in the evening, SUPER PACKED ! ! You'd think there was some sale or something ! . . Some people say the quality of their stuff is less than of the Charleston location. Meat quality, i think is the same. If you were to order fries, i've had varying experiences with that. Sometimes fresh out of the fryer, sometimes not. . . My favorites to get is beef tongue, pork stomach. Super flavorful and something you usually dont get at your chain store Taco Bell (rarely go fast food anyway, esp not Taco Bell). . Good idea, if you are going with other people... is if you want different meats, have each person be in different lines and get the order. Otherwise, you'll be in line for a long long time... . . Surprisingly, even the outdoor seating, there is always someone cleaning up. Great service ! Not like that was something i was looking for anyway, but it was a plus ! A lot of times, while sitting there after eating, and just talking, they'd come up and help us take our trays and trash away. . . Good central location to go to if you live on the West or South side. Fairly easy to get to, unless the Strip is busy due to a holiday or weekend.
Got a taco craving? Get yourself to Tacos El Gordo. Apparently there's a location on Charleston if you don't' want to go on the Sttrip, but this is the one I went to. You walk in and see the meat behind the counter, place your order and watch as it is made, then take your tray up to the cashier to pay. It doesn't get fresher than this.. . The lengua is amazing. I don't care how you feel about eating another animal's tongue, it's delicious- especially here, and particularly in the fries. Lengua quesadilla is also tasty, but the bottom tortilla is flour and the top is a tostada... so it's a little odd. Eat it anyway.. . Best tacos were the spicy pork and the beef shoulder, honorable mention to the super-crispy tripas. Ordered all as-is with the salsas and sauces. These people know what they're doing.. . Now for the lengua fries- a half order will run you $6, pricey for fries. But worth it. It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese. It sounds revolting but it's amazing, and it doesn't taste as heavy as it sounds, either- which is a bad thing because I could put away a lot of this dish.. . Side note: apparently if you order the "half order" and tip the guy, you end up with a wink and a full order. Oops.
Om om om... The only reason I did not give them 5 stars due to price and limited seating. But anyway, back to taco love land.. Amaz.. yes indeed. As you wait in your line of choice (each line has a designated list you can choose from of meats). You can order quesadillas, mullas, tacos, vampiros... with any meat of choice depending on your line of choice. As you wait you will notice fresh corn tortillas are being made and the meat sizzling on the burning grill. As you order you place your order with the man that chops the meat on the block and preps your order to your liking in a matter of seconds. If you ask for the everything you will get cilantro, chopped onions, salsa and guacamole.. mmmhmmm. You place your order on your tray and then walk over to the cashier, who they makes the count and charges your per item. She also is in charge of drinks, and if you want extra salsa (free) you request from her. As you head for the door to eat, don't forget to grab your limes, radishes and salt or pepper. As I mentioned earlier, depending on the time of day, you might not be able to find seating. THis is located in an older center north of the Wynn hotel, right next to some souvenir store. Definitely on my list of stops when in Vegas.
I do love me tacos and thank goodness this spot is not far off the strip.  its actually on the Strip!!! I can stumble my drunk ass over there from the Wynn casino.  If you go ne time pass 9p there will be a long ass line guaranteed.   I came here cuz my friend suggested it and thank goodness I did.   tacos go about $2 ea.  There are 3 different lines for certain meats so pay attention to the line your in.  people on yelp talk about the spicy pork but I suggest the cabeza and Tripas.   yeeeeeeeah boy were they good.  The two tortillas can't hold all the meat they pile on there!  Grab ur soda from the souvenir store next door and grab some tacos.  U will not leave hungry. you can put your $ on that.
Tacos El Gordo is the only place to go for real authentic tasting tacos at very affordable prices!  Located right on the strip, this is a very popular spot and is usually very busy.  They have a tasty selection of food to choose from.  I ordered the Tacos Adobada (spicy pork) and Tacos Asada along with a Sope Asada .  The Tacos Adobada was sooo mouth watering delicious! The pork was so tender and the salsa sauce was flavorful.  The Asada tacos and Sope were really good too, but the Adobada was the winner.. . When it is crowded (which is usually all the time) ordering can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first time. They have several counters where the meat is prepared.  Above the counters are the menus the items you can order from that counter. You pick up a tray go to the counter and place your order. They prepare the food in front of you. While at the counter you can also order grilled jalapenos and green onions. Very yummy.  . . After you visited the counters you go to the register to pay and also order any drinks.   Then you find a place to sit and enjoy. There is also a salsa cart with a variety of salsas fresh radishes, and limes. They offer free refills on the fountain drinks.  The inside seating is limited, but they also offer outside seating as well. . . Family owned straight out of Tijuana! They keep the prices affordable, $2 tacos! So please don't forget to Tip!! If you like the authentic feel and taste of a real taqueria, then Tacos El Gordo is a must stop when visiting Las Vegas!
While we were staying in Las Vegas for a trip we had a craving for tacos, so my husband found this place by doing a search on urban spoon. I was a little skeptical at first because my husband has a tendency to take me to sketchy areas for food while we're traveling which usually leads to a spat because I worry something bad is going to happen to us. It was a small trek and it's a little bit off the strip, but it was well worth it.. . This is hands down the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life! These were even better than the food we had while staying in Cabo. I still have cravings for this place. If this place was near us we'd be there at least once a week if not more! . . When we go back to Vegas we'll definitely make our way back here. Don't be skeptical if you're from out of town, you won't regret it!
Their tacos are small, but tasty. I fell in love with the adobada (spicy pork) tacos! Don't forget to add radish and lime, it's perfect when you're a bit peckish.
I went to vegas this past weekend for my birthday and my boyfriend wanted to visit a taco place he went to back in the day.  We told the cab driver where we wanted to go, he said, no you have to try here and thats how we found this place.  . . The food here was so freaking good! I spent 3 days in California with my cousin and had mexican at places that I thought had the best food, but after going here, I was proven wrong. . . First of all we had no idea what we were doing or what anything was.  But i knew it was going to be awesome because of all the cops eating there.  I went up to a cop and asked him a few questions about what to order and what he recommended.  10 minutes later we walked out of there with a giant bag full of food.  . . I wish i could give specifics on what we ordered, but honestly, I don't really remember.  We just took the cops recommendations and then when the guy behind the counter started asking us questions, I said " I have no idea, just make it like you would eat it."  . . Everything was so delicious! It was the best Mexican food I ever had.  I strongly recommend getting the spicy pork.  It was delicious.  I wish we got everything with spicy pork.  This is a place I will definitely visit when i go to vegas next time, and I know I will be craving their food in the near future!
With all the good reviews, I had to give this one a try. Glad I did! All the other reviews were spot on. Only downgrade from 5 stars is due to the disposition of the cashier. She was not very nice and was not happy when I had to ask more than twice for some translation because my Spanglish needs some work. Other than that, a few pesky gnats found their way onto my tacos. Ordered 2 steak tacos and 2 spicy pork tacos and a diet coke.---$10.05. Not bad for Vegas.
So much better than Taco Bell any day!. And just as cheap. . Perfect after the bar munchies fix.. The place gets packed but the line goes quick and there seemed to be plenty of seats to go around. . Staff is friendly.
excellent! I highly recommend the pork. The fries were surprisingly delicious. They look like a mess on the plate but they taste absolutely amazing. The service was fast and this is some of the cheapest food that you can get on the strip. I highly recommend it!
Pretty good tacos, I liked that tortillas were homemade, it's kinda hectic in here, pretty loud however the staff was very nice and the service was super fast especially the cooks behind the counters were incredibly fast preparing orders. I tried the crane asada tacos only so I can't say much about the rest of their food.
Maybe I am spoiled with the Mexican cuisine in Salt Lake City, but I just don't think this place lived up to the hype. Over 700 ratings averaging 4.5 stars, I thought it had to be mind blowing.. but not exactly. We had the spicy pork tacos and carne asada tacos. The guac was very bland. The service was reallybad, too. We ordered and stood there forever, finally getting our carne asada tacos. They must have completely forgotten about the pork tacos, but after reminding them we eventually got them. It wasn't even crowded, either. It was a bummer to discover the horchata was out of service, too. I wouldn't go back here--but that's because I can get better authentic Mexican in my hometown. I guess I can see how those who don't have access to these type of places would love it. It's definitely authentic.. just not that great.
Bombest mexican food ever! This is what "The Valley" needs! I come from LA and tried this place! It is the perfect mexican food spot, and everything is perfect and tasty! Would definently come back again, when i go visit vegas
All that hype and all that talk is definitely worth the 1 hour wait! The BEST tacos I've had in so long. I wouldn't recommend going here if you're a vegetarian, if you wait in that big line for a quesadilla be ready to see the cow brains slowly sizzling in some pot. haha . And for all you meat lovers don't miss out on these tacos, I had basic Asada tacos and a quesadilla with meat and it was amazing. Great taco spot and reasonably priced!
When I first came here, the area was pretty sketchy. Ordering my food was a bit chaotic because there are certain lines you have to stand in for certain foods, so that whole process was a bit confusing. When I finally was able to order my food, the cook making my food was so nice. He made my tacos quick and precise, it was pretty cool watching him throw guacamole and salsa  in the air and having them land perfectly on my taco. I would definitely recommend my friends to this place. Cheap and delicious food.
Definitely overrated. I ask you, how can you claim you make good Mexican food (supposedly full of flavor and spices) and you can't even be bothered to put a little salt in the guac? Everything I've ever tried here is so BLAND!. . The only redeeming thing about this place is when you see the little, old Mexican ladies making the tortillas in front of you. Having said that, I grew up on the Texas/Mexico border. Every taco shop on the border does that.. . Don't get me wrong. The tacos here aren't awful, but they're certainly not worthy of four or even three stars. My guess is that most of the people who gave this place a good rating were a little drunk when they ate the food.) The location is two seconds from Wynn.) If you're sober and want good tacos, go somewhere else. You're welcome.
Excellent flavor, fast cutting cooks, but long lines. Strategy in standing in line will help speed up the process. Must try when in Vegas...
Best tacos I've had in Vegas! $2/taco but worth it. If you come with another peraon and you both want diffferent types of tacos i would recommend each of you getting in a line since there are 3 different lines. This place is always full and long lines so be patient!
If you want the closes to authentic Mexican food, then this is the best place to come too. Try everything on the menu, especially the spicy pork.
Tacos were fantastic and at $2 a pop too. I had the spicy pork, which weren't too spicy. I had the regular pork and didn't really taste much of a difference between the two. The one drawback is if you want different types of tacos, such as the pork and the spicy pork, you have to get on different lines. My friend got the half order of carne fries. They were huge, it was full styrafoam container of fries, cheese, pork, guac and sauce. We couldn't finish them. The lines move pretty fast, but it is a hassle to wait on more than one line. Then you still have to wait on another line to pay. They had a tent for extra seating, which was heated. We arrived near closing and this place was packed and more people were coming in. I guess it was the place to grab some grub after a night of clubbing.
We walked by this place a couple times.  Always smelled delicious and was obviously popular based on there always being costumers at all times of day and night.  So we decided to give it a try for a cheap dinner.  Glad we did!. . To order, you walk up to the counter.  Read the signs because each section is for certain types of meat.  First time thru we ordered tacos de asada...the guy who prepared them was friendly and fast!   They were so yummy that we went back for more and decided to try the al pastor and the chorizo.  Delicious! . . With sodas and 3 tacos each, we paid about $15.  Really good deal for really good street tacos!  We'll eat here again for sure.
Azteca Tacos were amazing.  I thought El Guero Canelo was the business, but Tacos el Gordo on the LV Strip by Riviera (just past Wynn on S. Las Vegas Blvd) takes the cake.  Thankfully, they are a Tijuana brand and they are here in San Diego too.  Life is good.
Busy. Seems like the food is good. Just don't stand in line for 15 mins before you realize you are in the wrong line to order what you want.. . This place is a lesson in patience because there is no method to the madness. Unbelievably slow for $2 tacos.  It is as slow as they are fast.. . Finally got our food after like 35 minutes then there was mob as the cashier as people from five different lines tried to pay for their food.  Enjoy!
Where can you get authentic, fast, cheap tacos in Vegas? TACOS EL GORDO. There's one on charleston, but this review is for the one on las vegas blvd.. . Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and manymore incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then. . . WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order. . . HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient. . . If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved. . . PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club/after-party bite. . . FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it. . . Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people. . . VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats.
I think the ratings are a little skewed on this place. Unless you grew up eating this sort of disgusting crap, then you will not like this place. There is no chicken, fish, ground beef, vegetables, rice or beans. What they have is: beef brain, tripe, lengua (tongue) and some sort of fatty pork cut from a large skewer, and a few other combinations of these. Maybe this is authentic Mexican tacos, but the average AMERICAN diner will probably not be happy. Yes the tacos are 2 dollars, but hey are very small. The average male would probably want 4 to 6 tacos.
So we yelp this place and saw that it had great reviews. We were craving carne asada tacos so we trusted the comments. As soon as we got in the facility, it was like a smoke house. You could hardly breathe. So we waited in line for about 10 minutes to find out that we were in the wrong line. Still trying to be positive, we got in a line that you could only order carne.  . . We orders 6 carne asada tacos and carne fries. Not only did we pay about 26 bucks, the food tasted terrible. The meat was so hard and the tortillas were soaked with grease, we just left the food on the table for everybody to see. I was really surprised due to the reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day for us, but I don't think we will give it another chance.
These are the best tacos I have ever had. I had the tacos de lengua, adobada, al pastor, and carne asada. They were all delicious, with lots of flavor, and their own unique sauce for each meat. . . The carne asada fries were so good. They actually put carne asada not like other places. My wife and I shared the small size and it was more than enough. . . My favorite was adobada. It was full of flavor and really good sauce. The lengua was perfect, which I have a really hard time finding. Their al pastor was bomb with a really good sauce to go with it. . . This place is legit, and a everyone needs to try it. The line is long but worth it.
Right smack on the Strip! Perfect for after a night of clubbing & drinking. We actually came for dinner before the club. There was a hugeass line. Each line serves a different kinda meat. I enjoyed the tripas and the spicy pork! Very tasty tacos but......... I ended up having food poisoning afterwards and yacking everything out. =( The tacos did tasted good though so I will return next time to give it another chance.
Ughhh why are the lines soo long???. . Because they are that good. Yes. . . Really close to the Wynn, with a shared parking lot if you're driving, on the strip, open late, super cheap, and absolutely delicious after a day of drinking or not drinking whatever floats your boat.. . My favorite is the adobada (spicy pork) and who could say no to a cup of horchata for $1.40. Nobody that's who! Don't forget to ask for the pineapple! Yum.. . If you're going with a group of people, better split up and wait in different lines (there are 3) so you could order faster. Can't wait to visit the one in San Diego soon!
Authentic and wonderful. $2 tacos. No chicken ones. Everything is made fresh even the tortillas!  Great street food!
