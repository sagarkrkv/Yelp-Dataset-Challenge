Gate C has to be the worst gate I have ever tried to pass through....horrible slow service and the TSA agents do not care if your handicapped or having a heart attack......they just ignore you....this gate takes the " Hurry Up and Wait " to another level.....still trying to get through the x-ray part 1 hour later.....not kidding.....I feel sorry for the First Class people who paid more money to get through the line faster....when they too have to wait....there must be about 20-30 people waiting to check into 1 st class....something seriously needs to be looked at in this airport!
I've had a few connections through here lately as I've had a few US Airways flights.  This airport ranks near the bottom for me, mainly due to the lack of outlets.  They've got a few of those standalone charging stations around, but every time I've gone through here, I see people playing the charger shuffle - walk around the concrete columns to see if there's an outlet, look along the walls, see someone else charging and grab a seat near them so you can take the outlet when they leave.. . The seating and the like feel to be very dated - this is the kind of airport design I'd have expected to see in the 90s, not today.  . . While some gripe about the design of Terminal 4, I'm okay with it.  I've neverhad trouble making connections, but it does feel like I see more people running through this airport than others.. . One benefit of the large distance between gates in Terminal 4 is that if you do have time to kill, there's plenty of opportunity to walk - everyone seems to stick to the people movers, so the aisle in the middle is super long - they've even branded this as the Sky Harbor Fitness Trail, and it's a little over a mile from end to end.. . In any case, it's not like I have too much choice about what airport I end up going through, as I tend to go for the cheapest flight the four or so times I fly a year.  I just really wish they'd upgrade the gates so the seating was more modern, and put in outlets at the seats like every other airport seems to have done . . .
I had a 1 hour layover here on my way from LA to Philly. Of course, I was concerned about the time because at most airports, an hour is really cutting it close to get from one terminal to the other. Luckily for me, the airport is laid out pretty well with plenty of signage, and I was able to get there in plenty of time.
Best airport by far with the best airport food you'll ever find -- all the local Valley favorites, including nearly all FOX restaurants make an appearance here.  Did you know that Matt's Big Breakfast is opening a spot here?  How amazing is that?  If you don't know what Matt's is, Yelp it.. . I find Sky Harbor to be very clean, friendly staff, great shopping to kill time, and of course, as I mentioned, ridiculously good food to make it unbeatable.  Consider yourself lucky if you havea layover in PHX as you can get 5 star food as you wait.
Awful place to have a layover. This airport is always overcrowded, hence, there is little seating and you'll likely find yourself squished between two strangers until your flight. To avoid the crowd, I recommend grabbing a book and finding a restaurant with bar seating to enjoy some quiet and a few drinks before boarding.
I travel quite often and this airport was not very impressive. The southwest gates were quite crowded and the TSA security lines were not well organized. Very inefficient with lots of bottlenecking that could easily be avoided.  . . Tip I received from a local: When taking a taxi from the airport to the surrounding area---do not get ripped off!! There is a $15 minimum and you should map out your route to make sure the driver is not going the long way.
Huge airport with many food and drink locations.
Horrible experience. Had plenty of time to catch my flight after checking my bags BUT TSA had only 1 person checking id's and tickets. The line was snaked around for nearly an hour and we missed our flight. It took us 12 hours to get home and we hadto fly all over the country to finally arrive home safely.  The worst part of the experience, other than the no concern from TSA about their lack of proper staffing, was seeing our plane sitting at the gate and the airline wouldn't let us board because the gate was closed. Thanks again TSA .. . It was a ridiculous, stressful experience and if TSA were a private entity they would be bankrupt.  It's such a disgusting  feeling seeing how my tax dollars work!
It's OK.  A smallish airport that is pretty easy to navigate, get your bags and get out.  Relatively well air conditioned which is nice considering the conditions you're likely to face once you step OUTSIDE.  . . Fairly standard dining and shopping options --  about what you'd expect from a smaller metro airport.  Ample seating it appears.
Agree that food options are yummy. However, there is horrible crowding at the gate. Unacceptable.
I never have any issues at this airport.  Lines usually are short, TSA is generally quick.  This airport does a good job considering it's size, my only complaint is the amount of time it takes to get your bags.  Sometimes my flight is shorter than bag delivery.
Skyharbor airport terminal 2 has no restaurants or adult beverages.  Diagreement on rent caused restaurants to leave.  Make shift beer and wine are for sale as of 5 today at a bunch of tables.  Just awful care of travelers by an airport or city that obviously does not care about visitors.  Avoid this airport or terminal if possible.  We will.
I was dropped off at Phoenix Sky Harbor for a layover and thought it was very clean and easy to navigate. There is a good selection of restaurants, so you can choose your vice and pay an arm and a leg for the food you like best! Ha! . . Overall, it has the basic amenities you want. Free WIFI, good restaurant selection, friendly staff and no delayed flight for me!
Super super busy airport, it's chaos all around! From walking through the terminals to trying to find seating in a restaurant or gate! It's just chaotic!! They  have a moderate selection of restaurants. Mostly quick grab and goes in terminal A
This airport is in serious need of an update. Info kiosks/facility maps are hard to find (I assume they have them but I couldn't find one). Also, there are 2 wings per terminal which is quite confusing. One of the B terminal wings doesn't have a restaurant with a bar.
Reading a couple bad reviews while waiting at sky harbor and had to write a review. I don't think I ever had a bad experience here. It's always clean and the airport staff is always friendly.
Hands down, one of the nicest Airports in the United States.. . Very friendly workers, excellent parking facilities, new, well organized, and friendly.. . No wonder its called "America's Friendliest Airport.". . Phoenix Sky Harbor has great dining options, pre-flight parking, shuttle service, a great location in the middle of the metro area, an air tram, and does not have bad lines and rude TSA agents.. . Go Sky harbor!~
It's an airport, it's gets me places, and it has cool shops and restaurants. My heart is still with SFO but this airport gets the job done when you wanna get away for a little bit! :-)
