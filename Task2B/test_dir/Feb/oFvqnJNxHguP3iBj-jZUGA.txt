We were in Vegas during the christmas weekend. The fountain shows were awesome! They had two different type of music for which the fountain dance was done. One was classical and the other was hip hop. It was nice to watch the show for  even 2 or 3 times. Its just magnificent!
The fountains at Bellagio are beautiful from any angle!  We have seen them from the bridge and from the inside of both Prime Steakhouse and Yellowtail, and the best place to see them from was definitely Yellowtail.  Ask to be seated outside if you can stand a little shower during your dinner.  :)  Cheers!
Totally worth the price of admission.
A highlight of the Las Vegas Blvd strip and a wonderful sight to see at any time of day.. . Stop here for a few minutes, relax, enjoy the water show.. its among the best in the world.
We visit Las Vegas at least once yearly, and each trip always includes multiple viewings of the fountains at Bellagio. The first time I saw them, I was so impressed! The next trip, my husband proposed to me here while they played "Your Song" by Elton John. . . Thank you Bellagio for the wonderful memories. See you soon!
I could watch the fountains of Bellagio for hours. This is the most amazing thing in Las Vegas. Make sure you come by at night and remember that the songs are not always the same so it's o.k. to come back and enjoy it more than one time during your trip.
Perfect experience with the love of your life! Take a moment, gaze, embrace, enjoy the view! Perfect on a night like tonight.... Happy Valentine's Day!
Best show in Vegas. No matter how many times. Start at 11am. Every 30 min. Different composition. Get a seat at Patio Mon Ami Gabi for a great view. . Dinner at Paris Eiffel Tower for a better view. . You are always amazed
Loved it!!! This is a must when you come to Vegas. Each show was great and you're amazed every time. One of my favorites!
always great never disappointed me. Day show and night show are totally different because of the lighting and everything. You don't even have to wait for the perfect show time. If you walk around this trip, you will see the show at least one time. Or you can check online to see the show time so you can enjoy the entire piece of music and this masterpiece!
Great fun for the kids.  I always stop here to watch the fountain show!  Vegas isn't all partying and drinking.  There's some wholesome fun too.
Watch it at night while you are strolling around the strip, the light makes it even more amazing. Free show but it so much more. It is like a ten minute water show choreographed with music. A must see when you are in vegas. Day or night!
