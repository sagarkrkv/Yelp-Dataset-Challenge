Hookers a plenty. Do not stay here!!!!! The room was dirty. There was a condom wrapper on the floor when I walked in and the gaming floor was swarming with prostitutes.  Do no stay here.
Spa SUCKS!  After 3 long days walking and working KBIS I bought an hour long foot massage for my husband. . . The "masseuse" was 10 minutes late ... massaged his feet for 20 min. Then told him to relax and take a nap. . . She rolled back in on the hour to tell him he was done ... $100 ?  NOT GOOD !. . Want money back for THAT service. . . Certainly not worth the time OR $.. . Too bad :-(
Service sucks, staff is horrible. They act like they don't care and didn't help much to fix anything. Check in was bad, gave us 2 pairs of keys that didn't work then finally got a room that someone was in. We had an incident and needed security which were a joke especially the security supervisor Jack. Don't know he became supervisor, he seemed lost and was absolutely rude. Place is outdated and filthy. . . Yes rooms are cheaper, but not worth it.
if you like to play and drink for free this is not the place to go the cocktail waitress service is absolutely horrible!!!  . . we were inside of Club tempo for a BBW event the bar was completely packed the first drink I ordered from the waitress in the lounge which was not complementary and I knew that but I did not think it was going to be $9.50 for a freaking on Long Island iced tea. . second drink we went up to the bar and ordered the martinis that they had on special Apple martinis for $6 the price was okay for as strong as they were but when we went back for our second apple martini they ran out of sour apple pucker. . so I decided I wanted to play a little and get a drink from a cocktail waitress  and I must have been very lucky on where I Sat because the first rank came within 20 minutes  . . but after that drink I waited an entire hour before pushing my service button and calling the slots manager over 3 times to get a cocktail waitress to pay attention to the area that I was sitting in . . with the wide variety of selection that you have in Las Vegas with all the different casinos and hotels this casino it needs to pick it up a little more maybe they need more cocktail waitresses but other than that it was a good experience
I had a bad experience, although the hotel itself is not bad.  I was feeling ill during my stay (I was pregnant and didn't know it), and had been doubled over in bed with my iPod to comfort me.  I left the iPod in the sheets unknowingly, and when we checked out, I must have left it there.  Later that day, I called the LVH reporting I had most certainly left my iPod in the room (it has never been found in our possession since).  They sent someone up to look for it, but it was nowhere to be found, and housekeeping had already been through there.  It had not been turned in by housekeeping.. . I don't know how many hotels hold housekeeping accountable, but they were never able to find out who took it.  Some housekeeping person has a very nice gift now.  . . Bummer.  As for the hotel, we find it to be a good deal, so we stay there occasionally.  It has decent restaurants and lively hallways.  The rooms are clean and attractive enough.  It's too bad they don't have a way of finding out who cleaned certain rooms to determine which of their staff are thieves.  Not sure how many hotels are able to do this anyways.  The experience was enough to make me not want to stay there next time.
You get what you pay for I guess.  Service by some is horrible and great by some.  Some food servers really don't like their job, like the guy carving meat at the Italian buffet and the Asian women black jack single deck delayer who barks out at player when they don't know the rule of that game and also the rather plump hostess at burger house who seems to not like non whites. Good food is not to be found after 9pm. If not for location near convention center this place would be a ghost town and a single star.
Could use a little work but 3 stars is what I would go for here.
The hotel needs major renovation, amenities are minimal. Its only redeeming quality is the easy walk to the convention center.

Lackluster hotel that should have been torn down years ago. Stained carpets, long check in lines, tattered decor.... . There are too many other places to stay in Vegas to justify staying at the LVH.
First room: carpet is stained, meh not that big of a deal. The crowning of the roof looks awful (needs repairs,  \_()_/  eh it's just decor)....then I noticed a light was out. Okay it's one light, it's not that big of a deal. Go into the bathroom, okay the towel rack is coming out from the wall and looks like it will be ripped from the wall at any moment.... (-2star for these things).. . I go to put my stuff in the safe..."Lo-bat" appears. Okay really, that's a BIG deal for me -1star . . Call front desk, friendly assoc. asked to be relocated. They did so in a timely manner. (And also bumped us up the next level room) which btw the same light is out in the new room.. . 1-star friendly assoc. 1-star attempt to fix previous problems. . Edit: see photo added. New room has a huge-ass line on the tv screen. Also the AC doesn't work -1star. . Wow to the damage found in the bathroom see pic!
Stains in the carpets. Fixtures falling off the wall and a big green line through the Freaken TV overall this place is a ratchet shithole. No wonder Paris Hilton sold this piece  of shit hotel before everything fell apart on her.
0 Stars if we could.  BED BUGS, Mold, blood on the floor for over 24 hours by ice machine, elevator doors would not open or close all the way.  The front desk was rude and of no help when we found the bed bugs.  The place should be shut down.  It is not safe for the workers or visitors.
This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Los Vegas, and that is saying a lot since I've been to Vegas 30 times at least in my life. . . Due to a scheduling conflict here in Vegas, this was really the only hotel that had availability. I'm going to write the review now while it is fresh on my mind.. . First, I checked in to my room and there is a dirty towel on my bed and another dirty towel in the sink. I called immediately and told the front desk and they seemed to not understand what I was asking for. Obviously I want to change rooms, the woman seemed appalled that I'd want to change rooms over 'a towel' as she put it. Anyway, I finally got to my next room, and it looked like it had been cleaned. The carpet is stained though, so it is tough to tell. I had just sat down on the bed and then the door knocked for housekeeping, so maybe this room wasn't cleaned. I just ignored it and assumed someone forgot they got this room.. . The bed is horrible. Has to be 30 years old and just feels like you're laying on metal. They make you pay for tooth paste instead of offering it complimentary. Of the 20 other places I've stayed at in Vegas, they're the first to do that. . . The food was horrible, I ordered room service pizza and it came fried to the paper plate that it was on, so I couldn't even eat it unless I wanted to eat the paper plate as well as they were melted together (the crust and plastic plate). . . Please do not stay here. Book early and get a decent hotel. This hotel is an travesty and the only decent thing about the whole property is the Sportsbook. . . Also, the hotel staff are likely homeless Las Vegas residents based on their demeanor, intelligence, and attire.
Awesome hotel if you're here for the convention center; not-so-awesome if you're here for everything else! With that being said, it's off-strip and by the north end of the strip. The plus to this location is that it's a pretty short cab ride to the Wynn/Encore.. . Most of the time, you can get a room here dirt-cheap through one of those last-minute booking apps/sites unless there's a convention going on. I've gotten a room for $31/nt. Dude, that's cheaper than a janky motel to handle yo business!. . The rooms are decent if you're just looking for a place to crash out and shower. It can get pretty lonely here.
i satyed here for valentines weekend had the worst experience ever!!!! at check in they had all my info wrong, 1st night we had bed bugs all over the bed...my cousin was bitten. it was very disgusting the worst part they even downgraded my room because they were sold out according to front desk people. at the end they charge me for both nights and all they gaved me was a claim #. i called them today for a refund and again the claim number they gaved me of course was wrong risk managment couldnt find my claim # and all they said is call customer service!!! wtf are they thinking after all i went through i still need to contact them. this is redicoulous!!!
I think I got bed bugs from this hotel. I just left after sleeping there for 2 nights during the MAGIC market week trade show and I am itchy all over and have weird red bite markets on my body. The hotel was cheap and convenient to the LVCC where part of the show was. Expensive drinks and a serious cigarette smoke smell and I'm a smoker! Honestly, it was a good deal for the most part but the only thing I really car about is cleanliness. It doesn't have to be luxury with fancy shops and restaurants when I'm on a business trip but clean, YES! I am so uncomfortable right now, I hope they get it together!!!! #gross
When you call  for reservation they try to upsell with resort club.now when you there using it the person who works at the 24th floor where you get the snacks and drinks , the person who works there is giving the customers a hard time to get in the place.been going there for the past couple of years seems like the services is getting less and less the past couple of years
This was my third time staying at the LVH. With my company,I travel to numerous trade shows, many of which are held in Las Vegas. This hotel is very dated but always seemed to be the best option for location and proximity to the convention center. Well, this particular trip turned ugly when on the second morning of my stay I woke up, went to the restroom and when I returned to bed, there were bed bugs crawling on the pillow. I had never seen one before but a quick search on my phone confirmed their identity. I called house keeping right away and they sent up a security guard that collected the bugs in little baggies. They sent up a bell hop to carry my things to my new room in the old unrenovated tower (downgrade). The security guard said you need to wash those clothes as soon as possible in hot water. I happened to agree. I had one more night to stay at the LVH and I in NO WAY wanted to transport those nasty creatures back to my home in FL. When I got to my new room and I made a call to find out about laundry services. I was passed around to about 4 different people before someone was able to tell me if my clothes could be laundered. House keeping passed me to the Bell hop, bell hop passed me to housekeeping. To make a long story short. It was the epitome of unorganized. Aside from the security guard saying one time, "Sorry for the inconvenience". That was the only time I was apologized to. I realize accidents happen and those bugs are a problem that hotels sometimes run into but I was shocked at how management did barely the minimum. A simple call from the manager with an apology would have gone a long way. But instead no apology as well as no compensation for my troubles, not only was a charged the full amount of the room and resort fees....I was also charged for one of the keurig coffee kits (I don't even drink coffee). This hotel was a huge disappointment, I will not be staying here again. Even though it is the most convenient to the convention center, I don't think poor customer service like I experienced, should be rewarded. Unfortunately, because of the trade shows and proximity to the center, I think they get much more business than they deserve. They have given up on customer service because of guaranteed business they get from the trade shows.
Woooaaaahhh.  This place has changed, and not in a good way, since they lost the Hilton title.  . . Some of the rooms are renovated.  They'll try to upsell you a renovated room when you get there.  The regular rooms are dated, but ok.  This isn't a 5 star strip hotel.  If you're here, you probably got a deal, or saw the dirt low price.  The resturaunts are good, and the buffet is average.  The sports book is maaaasssssiiivvveee.  . . See that dirt-low price?  Yeah, so did everyone else.  The place is now loaded with lower-end people.  I saw two fights with security the last time I was there; one involving no less then 5 security officers. (Jan 2014). . So, yeah, the Fremont crowd found this hotel.  Friday and Sat nights is Latino club night; the band is actually good if your in a Spanish mood.  . . If you're the picky type, stay away.  You'll find plenty wrong.  If you want a dirt cheap hotel near the strip, this is the place.
Checked in, table was dirty and stained. Only 1 device can be on Internet BUT you can add more for $13.95 each. No comp in-room coffee ($3.50) per cup...this will be a one time stay. Just left circus circus where comp coffee as we had 3 devices using wifi...although LVH gives you $8 credit per day for not having housekeeping come in...
Just completed a 3 night stay at the LVH.  Nothing to write home about.  Service and amenities rated at 2 for the cost. We did not get the room dirt cheap either!! Then they charged extra for everything. Hotel staff including housekeeping and wait staff in the casino and restaurants were scarce...good service and attention to detail was lacking.
