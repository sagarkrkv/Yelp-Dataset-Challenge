I really love the actual Fremont Street Experience. Every time I've been to Vegas (25+ times) we always go at least for lunch or a walk around. . . The stores are cool for picking up a bunch of gifts for the kiddos at home and the food is reasonably priced pretty much anywhere you go.  There is a few more expensive places you can eat within some of the casinos but its simple to find something more reasonable, there are adverts all over the place that price some of the most reasonable food. . . Its close to the Mob museum which I had a great time at. . . Also all the old neon is really amazing to see and you just don't get the same feel for it on the main strip.. . Its always loud and upbeat. The performers are cool, though I stay away from the ones in costume looking to get tips for pictures, they are normally smelly/dirty close up and you don't really want a picture with that. Keep in mind, these people wear those costumes EVERYDAY.. . My biggest complaint is that its dirty, right off the experience around any corner its gross and ghetto and there are homeless begging everywhere. . . The artists with the spray paint are most assuredly my favorite thing about the Fremont Street Experience, having stood and watched them a sum total of 10+ hours throughout all my trips there and purchased multiple pieces, I really enjoy it and I think they are the reason that I go back every time I am there.
This place is definitely a must see. Where else in town where you can see a light show under a canopy outdoors while you have your own preferred beverage and food and listen to free concerts, shop, dine and gamble in one spot.  Or where else you can zipline under a canopy of lights.  I only rate this place a 4 star out of 5 because I believe it needs more security or law enforcement officers to keep everyone safe and secure and help prevent homeless people from soliciting money or donations because it can hurt business.
Every time I have visitors from out of town, this is one of the default places I take them to. If you ask me, I think this place is way better than the actual walk on the strip. Why, you may ask? Well, for starters, you will run into way more "Characters" then the ones you see on the strip simply because you have way more room to walk around and mingle. If you are worried about security, don't worry, they always have cops on bikes patrolling the area. From all the times I have been going here, they do a pretty good job of keeping you safe.. . The Fremont Street Experience is just that. An EXPERIENCE. If you do this walk every night for a week, I guarantee you will see something different besides drunk ass people falling over themselves and throwing up if they havnt already. There's usually live bands playing in at least three different sections of the place. Sometimes you will have well known bands play every now and then. Just last year, when The D Hotel/Casino first opened, they paid One Republic to put on a concert right in front of the hotel entrance to promote their place. That concert was packed but was worth the entertainment.. . You also have the giant screen above you that shows about 10 to 15 minutes of tributes to various singers and bands like Queen and The Doors. This is usually every hour on the hour starting at 7 until midnight. They change the start times and show material every so often. . . Of course you have all the different casinos with all their food and drink specials to drag you into their establishments. Various specials like 99 cent shrimp cocktail and 9.99 prime rib specials, not to mention 99 cent deep fried twinkies and oreos.. . Just recently, they have been building a zipline attraction called Slotzilla that replaces the old one because it was short and not very high. At the time of  this review, I thought they were supposed to be done with it about 3 months ago.. . If you go further down away from where the giant screen ends (not the Plaza Hotel side), where Heart Attack Grill is, you find a lot more attractions specifically designed for the drinking crowd of 21 and over. Places like Insert Coins, The Griffin, and further down, the Container Park.. . So once you get tired of the strip, come here and hang out in old Vegas where it all started. Just make sure to tip any characters you take pictures with because that is how some if not all make their living.. . Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #44
Like walking into the world's largest homeless shelter.. . I remember visiting "The Fremont Street Experience" shortly after they unveiled it with it's beautiful high-tech roof, talented street artists every block or so, and cops walking the beat. I felt safe and it was exciting.. . Years have passed.. . I paid $7.50 to park across the street. There are a few street artists there, but mostly it was assorted toothless meth heads begging for money, a guy dressed in a dirty Elmo costume, a blank-stared woman with a sign tied around her neck that read "homeless vet's wife needs help", some shoeless folks sleeping in the planters, and drunk people barfing on the street. No cops, but some private "security" kids huddled in groups talking and drinking their energy drinks. The concrete was sticky with some unknown substance most everywhere I walked. Merchants stand outside their shops trying to grab some unsuspecting fool and sell them a wrinkle treatment, good luck charm, novelty photo or some other useless crap. In line for a cheap hot dog, a filthy drunk guy shouted and cursed unintelligibly right next to me for the 10 minute wait. . . This place is like a nightmare where nothing makes sense and it's all very frightening. I can take care of myself, but don't recommend you come here and take any chances. Unless of course you find the possibility of being knifed at any moment attractive.
You may not want to bring young children here... . . First off, the Fremont Street Experience is pretty impressive, if not even jaw-dropping. The light show is properly psychedelic and not to be missed if you ever visit Las Vegas. Four or five stars for that.. . However ... there are lots of people (women and men) standing around wearing very little in the way of clothing, and you can get your picture taken with them - for a price. Don't ask me how much, because I don't know. The guys with Spiderman, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man and Captain America costumes are kid-friendly, at least. There is a jazz sax man who plays soprano, alto and tenor sax, and he is pretty good. And the contortionist is worth watching, anyway.. . You will also find lots of kiosks where you can buy tee-shirts and all manner of interesting things.. . But, overall, Fremont Street should be rated PG-13, if not R. . . And the postcards of "Sin City" invariably show some voluptuous chick, but maybe they should show some fat slob gorging himself at a buffet. That's a sin, too.
It's been almost a decade since I've been back to downtown Vegas...and what a transition in the right direction it's made!. . Fremont Street is a big part of that no doubt and it is no longer the shady cesspool of homeless, drunkards, and meth-heads it was a few years back.. . The cool projector overhead that puts on a thematic show is still pretty much the same as it was, but they have added a zipline that you can ride right under the canopy and there are a lot more shops and restaurants than there used to be.. . There is also an outdoor bar by the D Hotel and an easy access entrance to the 4 Queens.. . I loved that it was within easy walking distance from my hotel, The Downtown Grand and even walking back at 2am, it was well-lit and I never felt in danger as a single female walking by myself.. . I also enjoyed the free musical acts that performed on the Center Stage right on 3rd. I saw Bridge, this electric cello duo that was absolutely amazing! . . I am glad to see that under the grit there is the glitz of Downtown Vegas' centerfold. You clean up well, Fremont!
Fremont Street is fun and a ball for people watching.  But, I always get depressed by the local with the baby at 1 AM,  or the guy who can't walk to the car, but is going to try and drive, or the 80 year old man with his beer, red eyes, and pants he can't seem to pull up his pants. If you need motivation to stay in school kids, visit Fremont Street.
They are really whipping this place back into shape.  Its  lil SLEAZY, which is definitly my scene.. there are a ton of little mom and pop/hipster bars as well.. come check it out
As you can probably tell from my other reviews, I LOVE this part of Vegas. Everyone thinks of The Strip when they think of Las Vegas, but Downtown is where it all started. The Strip is the cool spot, the place to be seen, the place to spend a ton of money on clubs and dining and being at the center of "it". Fremont St. Experience is where you make your own "it" - it's a much more real, down-to-earth vibe, where everyone is focused on gambling, getting drunk, and having a good time. You get the classic feel of Vegas - from the lights of "Glitter Gulch" to rounds of Sigma Derby in the D's classic slots room. Elvis Impersonator concerts? Check. Street performers offering anything from ventriloquism to banana hammocks to bring the end of the world via the pan flute. Yeah, they have that too. Cheap Eats? Fancy dining? You're covered either way. Craft Beer? There's three craft breweries to choose from - Triple 7, Chicago Brewing Company, and the newly-opened Banger Brewing. . . It's not all sunshine and roses ... don't be surprised ifyou're approached for a "donation" or a "proposition" at some point. And I wouldn't recommend straying too far from the main drag at night. But I felt perfectly safe cruising down the heart of the Fremont St. Experience at any time of night. And there is ALWAYS something going on.. . Maybe your goal on your trip to Vegas is to do the cool things, be part of the "it scene" with the beautiful people, and that's fine. But do yourself a favor and take a bit of time to go down to "Old Vegas" and take in the Experience that is Downtown on Fremont St.
I have heard so many reviews about the Fremont Street Experience I was looking forward to making it down there to see what the commotion was all about. . . We walked from the Downtown Grand Hotel which seemed like it put us about the center of the experience. We walked up one side of the street and came back down the other and I must admit I really enjoyed seeing all of the street performers. ...Some of them were quite amazing, some were just so so and some I just couldn't understand why they were out there..... they werent doing anything but just stainding there expecting tips ...lol. . Every hour on the hour the light show plays and it just so happens that the show we saw was what I would call a dedication to our men and women in uniform. All I can say is WOW.... what an awesome tribute.. Looking forward to going back tomorrow night.
