Great location and very good food. If you're looking for a patio restaurant in central phoenix, I'd highly recommend it - perfect for a date or a group of ~10-15 people (though if you're going at prime time, you'll probably want to call ahead).
This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the downtown phoenix area... Don't be tempted to eat too much for dinner since you will want lots and lots of room for the amazing crepe desert, go ahead get strawberry and banana .. You will not regret it!  . Perfect date place as well, so cute and adorable...
I tried out Cibo today for the first time after hearing rave reviews.  The food was good but not the best I've ever had, but the patio and our server Sean Kennedy made this place worthy of five stars.  Right from the get-go he had us laughing so hard and never made us feel rushed when we sat around for two hours giggling.  I can't wait to come back and experience the great patio again!!
We went for our anniversary - great experience. Very good appetizers, salads and pizza.  There is no pasta on the menu except on Tuesdays & Wednesdays when they make it in house. Looking forward to going back
Got the sausage pizza for lunch and found it to be tasty. Service was attentive and friendly, and the outdoor patio was really cute!
Great Food. Love this place! Getting a table can be a little hard!
This will be long winded- . . So after much anticipation and . Many raving rants from the yelp community I finally got to experience Cibo tonight. My expectations were high, and I was not disappointed by any aspect of my experience tonight.. . Cibo is a urban bungalow converted into a charming italian eatery. My 1st thought upon entering this place was "wow, what a versatile space". The front patio is rather large and has open space where they have musicians provide music and there's even a fire pit. You can eat inside or out. The inside had a very intimate and warm feeling and perfectly matches the family owned vibe I get from this place. . . Let me get to what made my experience great tonight. Our servers name was was Kui. She was very pleasant and extremely helpful. She was full of sincere and convincing recommendations, we pretty much ordered everything she told us to and it was all exactly as she explained it would be. . . The food- Per Kui's recommendation I ordered the Diovola Pizza and added the ricotta cheese and it was delicious. This pie instantaneously put cibo above all the Artisanal style pizza places I've tried in Arizona. The Parlor, Pane bianco, and Le Grande Orange are all inferior to Cibo in my book. As good as the pizza was, it wasn't even the highlight of the night. That distinction belongs to their Nutella and Marscapone stuffed crepe with ice cream. Wow, so good it's sinful. The combination of the fresh crepe with Nutella filling and the Ice cream was magical. It is quite possibly the best desert I have ever had in any restaurant. . . Tonight's visit to Cibo was actually a test run. I've been looking for a place to hold a dinner for a large party and when I got word that cibo's private "Carriage House" that can hold 50 or more guests I decided to come in and see if the food is good enough to reserve that space for my event. Needless to say they passed the test. Their hospitality, charm, food and character make Cibo one of the finest restaurants phoenix has to offer and I can't wait to show this place off to the guests of my next event.
YUM!! In the day and age where we are all trying to start away from carbs, Cibo's is the one place for a cheat day! There lunch menu is delicious with so many Panini's to choose from. I love the pulled pork one and all of the sandwiches with prosciutto and/or spek, but the best part is the oven baked bread. Their dinner menu is delicious too with toppings like spicy salami or Asian pears and prosciutto. Just make sure you save room for their fruit crepes with ice cream! ** know before you go- Cibo's has different menus for lunch, dinner and weekend brunch so take a look on their website nad plane your visit accordingly.
Best pizza in town!
All Good -- Great lunch today. Service was good. We wanted to eat outside today given the weather but no shade tables were available. No worries -- we had a wonderful meal inside. We are a party of 4 that loves pizza and hungry. We had the DiNotte, Salsiccia and the Genova pizzas. They all were excellent-- fresh crust not too thick and the dough had been allowed to rise properly. Toppings were all fresh and there are multiple non tomatoe sauce options which is to my liking. The Gorgonzola on the DiNotte pizza gave it a unique distinctive flavor(good). We also had 2 salads -- the house salad was very fresh. In my opinion the biggest distinction was the freshly grated Parmesan flakes. My wife had the only other salad offered prior to 3 on Sat which had strawberries, goat cheese, and candies walnuts over spinach. My wife added grilled chicken and enjoyed it all.. The restaurant is not close to my house, however I will go back again when I am near downtown for lunch again.
Great food.   Service wasn't very attentive the day I went.  Needed to get up and go ask for 4 out of 5 plates to eat since we only had one after clearing our salads.  However, I would definitely recommend Cibo given how good the food is (spicy salami pizza was awesome) and give them a one time pass on the service that day.
Wow.  What a treat!  We are the defacto self appointed pizza experts.  We've been to all of them.  Sally and Pepes in New Haven and everything in the Valley.  When we hear about a new place, we have to try it.  So we pulled in, expecting to go to the Vic next store and felt the need to try Cibo.. . It's a quaint restaurant in a former house and off the beaten track.  The pizzas, sald and wine were stupendous for a Sunday afternoon.  Service was great too.  We opted for patio seating with the great weather.. . This place blows Federal and Pizzeria Bianco out of the water.  No questions.  The pizza is perfect and a well balance of cheese, bread, sauce and toppings.  You must go you must and you must try.  It is on our favorites list.
So wonderful. The best place to get gluten free pizza in Phoenix. The patio is excellent. Live music on Friday and Saturday.
Most amazing pizza and salads! This place rocks, the service is great, and the atmosphere is perfect.
Ate here last night while visiting Phoenix..   I would highly recommend this restaurant.   Gourmet Pizza's, unique appetizers, full bar.... . Great outdoor seating area.... . Cibo makes one of the best crusts I've had.... . . Go here if you're in town...
Went in 2012 loved it havnt been since but When I drive by its always busy. Food was pretty amazing.
Awesome gluten free pizza, salads and beautiful atmosphere. Love eating on the patio, it's a great date night restaurant! Love eating here when we go to First Friday. Great service too. Recently heard they offer gluten free crepes now too; cannot wait to try!! Two thumbs way up.
We have tried most of the acclaimed about wood-fired pizza places in the valley and Cibo may be at the top of our list. . . Location is adorable and unique. We don't leave Scottsdale too often for dinner but Cibo is definitely worth the drive. . . The wine menu is excellent and earns bonus points for having amazing Arizona wines available. . . As for the pizza... EXCELLENT! Fresh ingredients, outstanding taste, perfection. . . They are always busy so plan on waiting but grab a glass of wine and enjoy the surroundings.
amazing pizza and great service
Yum! Calzones are delicious, pizza is good too. Wasn't really a fan of their breakfast menu, however the Bloody Marys are amazing! I would definitely recommend to anyone.
Everything on paper looks perfect.  We waited 45 minutes for a table that never came.  Called before I got there to make sure it wasn't too bad.  I was told to expect a 20 minute wait.  No biggie.  After a 45 minute wait, I was told another 30 were required.  Had tickets to Tosh so I had to leave.  Thank goodness for the magic speed the brothers from Los Dos Molinos put on their chile rellenos.  It was like they were crossing the Rio Grande all over again.  Screw SB1070,  I need mexican food anyways!. . Food may be good, but I'll never know now.
OUTSTANDING food and ambiance-- Had the proscuitto pizza and it was to die for. . . The Limoncello was fantastic, too! Definitely a trendy spot to check out in downtown Phx
LOVE their pizza!
I could live on the meat and cheese plate alone for the rest of my life.
It was on a Sunday afternoon when I planted my heart in this restaurant. I didn't expect to fall in love with the decor not to mention the food...I was a little nervous ordering but after I ate their pizza my belly didn't have any bad reaction to their cheese or meat so I was relieved. I will definitely return
Cibo is great.  I've been coming here since 2005 and it's been a favorite for casual and intimate nights out.. . The pizza is good, but not my favorite in Phoenix.  I really enjoy their salads and desserts.  The crepe with Nutella inside, fruit on top and icecream is absolutely delicious!  And I usually don't even like crepes.. . The cons - no parking lot, so you have to search for street parking or use their valet service; also poor ventilation inside, so your clothes and hair end up smelling like their pizza oven; the noise level inside can get pretty loud.
Finally made it back to one of my favorite patios in Phoenix for a delicious lunch! . . We enjoyed the Sardegna (baby spinach salad) with grilled shrimp and a Vegetariano  Saltinocca (sandwich) hot. . . The salad was absolutely perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. The shrimp was perfectly grilled. Plenty of candied walnuts and goat cheese with fresh strawberries and spinach. . . The Vegetariano was very good as well. Could have used a punch of flavor with a pesto or some kind of sauce. . . Great service and perfect seating on the patio engulfed by the big tree. . Thanks Cibo!
Loved this place! We went on a cool  December night, the heating lamps and firepit were going outside. Tables had candle lights and the band was playing very cool blues. Such cute downtown Phoenix ambiance. Pizza's are enough for 2 or 1 hungry eater. As 3 hungry ladies, we split the Capricciosa and Margherita pizzas. They were light and yummy. Wine selection is pretty large. We shared a nutella and banana crepe desert which was also very light but so delicious. Cannot wait to visit again. Hopefully next time, we'll sit outside.
love loveee loveeeee loveeee loveeeeeee loveeee.. . I've been here more than ten times. I absolutely love everything about this place. The atmosphere,  the people, the vibe I get. I just love it here. And who doesn't like it when someone is singing and playing the guitar while you wine and dineeee? So romantic and just perfect. . . Its my favorite place for pizza and wine. yummmmm.. . I come every day if I can. Haha
