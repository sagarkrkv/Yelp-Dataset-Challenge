Excellent desserts here. Unless you get something truly exotic, you will not be disappointed. They do everything very well.. . During our last visit to Las Vegas, Super Bowl weekend, the wife went and picked out four desserts. I enjoyed all of them. There was a key lime tart, and an assortment of other chocolate-based options. Because I was not at the counter with her, I can't tell you exactly what they were. I can tell you, though, that my palate was extremely happy with the items she brought back to the table. . . Win.
5+ stars. But does that need to be stated? Jean Philippe is the best and they know it. Every aspiring pastry chef should stop here once in their lifetime, just to be  inspired. The artwork and detail they put into their cakes, chocolates, and pastries is nothing short of amazing. . . I'll admit, one of my guilty pleasures is coming here often (guilty because it's so expensive, I feel guilty). I'll update this review with more pictures and descriptions soon. . . So far these are the pastries I've tried. . Rose Macaroon - rose colored macaroon stuffed with raspberries and cream. Absolutely gorgeous. The taste is really light, I couldn't tastethe rose. It's kinda shame I inhaled the thing, as it was much better to gaze at than eat. . . Pistachio rice krispy - Good. They have different types of rice krispy treats next to the register and I got this one because it was green. The pistachio flavor was really light. . . My favorite purchase so far has been their small box of chocolates. It comes in a gorgeous box, that is akin to an intricate jewelry box. Their chocolates are small explosions of flavor, just the way I like my sweets, enough to pleasure the palate but not too much so that a diabetic high follows. . . My favorite flavors were the simple ones: Rustic (Crunch Pralines with Gianduja Ganache) and the Tahiti (White Vanilla Rum Ganache). But every flavor I tried was outstanding. I highly recommend buying a box, not just for the chocolate connoisseur, but as a gift that will impress and amaze.
Chocolates ordered include Canelle, Rustic, Crunchy, Earl Grey, Gringo, Tahiti, Piemont, Caramel. . ...suffice it to say that neither time nor a second location has diminished the quality of Jean Phillippe Patisserie, a second visit to the larger Aria location proving every bit as good as the first as I shared eight varieties of chocolate presented in a jewel-box display with a friend.  From the bright aromatics of the cinnamon Canelle to the simple pairing of chocolate and salted caramel each of the two-bite squares was beautifully crafted with subtle nuances and with well sourced pure-bean chocolates both dark and milk providing the backbone every flavor and texture proved remarkable; the coffee spiked Gringo and rum soaked Tahiti my personal favorites, and all the better enjoyed at the restaurant's counter overlooking the casino floor and the scene that is Sin City on Saturday night.
Had the chcocolate eclair,  must have if you love chocolate with a perfect crunch and a creme filling. Will be back for sure.
When staying at Vdara or Aria, this really is the best choice for a quick latte and breakfast. I visited many times for a little morning caffeine and pastry. Nothing disappointed either other than the long line and inconsistency of the lattes. When trying to get out and about as fast as possible in the morning, waiting in a line for 15 minutes for a coffee and croissant is a little annoying. Also, when you're paying a premium for a latte, you kind of expect it to not vary in bitterness and creaminess from day-to-day. . . The big demand on this little patisserie really puts pressure on the staff to preform quickly and accurately on each order. Little mistakes (like the lattes) are forgivable, and for the most part those don't even appear to happen often. Overall, I'm very impressed with how the staff handles the chaos of the morning rush. I probably would be tearing my hair out after an hour of customers changing then re-changing orders, continuous bumping into other staff, and the constant stream of white noise from espresso machines and slot machines. Props to all those who can handle it.. . This really was a golden addition to Aria. It fills a very specific yet prevailing need of it's and Vdara's guest; better coffee then Starbucks and more food options. I can honestly say that without JP, I would have felt there was something lacking in my experience staying at Vdara.
This dessert shop is located on the Aria next to the Zarkana theater. . . There is a wide array of deserts from gelatos and sorbets to crepes to the chocolates, macarons, and candies from most patisseries as well as cakes and baked goods. . . I was excited to check this space because the displays are so intricate and impressive. I figured the actual deserts would be better than most. After dinner in the Cosmopolitan, I came here with a friend to celebrate his birthday. . . Berry gelato is my go-to and it was tart, the way I like it. Too tart for my fiance. He really liked the cinnamon roll which they heated for him. Those were probably the best oc what we ordered. . . The macarons were disappointing for $2.25. The cappuccino was bland and the raspberry lacked jam so it only tasted like raspberry essence. The chocolate was only a little better. At least the strawberry piece had fruit filled jam inside. My fiance's chocolate cake was too rich. . . Overall, there was a wide variety but it was definitely disappointing. I wouldn't mind paying these prices for high quality dessert but it just didn't measure up. I wonder if done of the newly made desserts are better in the morning. . . Service was slow. We had to wait in 3 different lines and it was inefficient. Seating is available and self-selected. Remember to bus your own tables.
So my boyfriend and I were here this last Sunday and were really wanting to try this place for breakfast. After waiting 25 MINUTES in line, we get to the register to place our order and the lady tells us it's going to be another 25 MINUTES for our food to come out. Whatttt?? 50 minutes for a crepe? No thanks Jean Phillipe's. The least you could have done was togive your customers a wait time in advance. Unfortunately, we just left and didn't get to try their crepes so I can't tell you how they tasted but as far as customer service goes, this place is a thumbs down.
The best chocolate I've ever had. . Their milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars are so simple, but I love them the best because the clarity of flavor really shines through without the distraction of creams or nuts or other accoutrements. . . JP chocolate is light, and not cloyingly sweet and full of additives like, say, a Hersheys bar would be. It just tastes expensive! . . The actual shop itself is like an adult Wonka Factory. The chocolate fountain is ultra whimsical and there are beautiful pastries and boxes and specialty chocolate displays everywhere and it's just... it' s just a happy place. I'm sad that I don't have constant access to JP chocos, as I'm from Hawaii. I must stock up and nibble at them covetously in bed every night :b Rations, ppl, rations!
It was pretty funny, as I Yelped JPP to figure out what type of dessert to get, I read this one chick's review about the opera cake and then I was sold. And then I realized it was my own review from a few years ago. Self-convinced! Anyway, I decided on the opera cake (~$7) and hubby went for the cheesecake (~$7). The line was really long on a Sat. morning and the servers were kind of attitudinal (for reals!), so we decided to cancel our order and come back when things piped down a bit. I think that the 'tudes brought my review down a star because when you're in a magical sugary fantasyland like JPP you sort of expect happy servers and rainbows and glitter spewing from the sky.. . It doesn't mean I won't be back 'cuz it's still my fav Patisserie in Vegas.
Jean Philippe, my go-to spot for desserts. I have yet to be disappointed by any item I've tried, and I don't anticipate ever to be disappointed. They have a variety of delectables, from pastries to gelato to paninis.
Located just past the lobby and lines for Haze. We had visited the Bellagio location the night before and this location was faster, but the creeps were not as good. The strawberries were sour, the whip cream was completely without taste and the style of crepe building was different. The crepe was entirely folded before any garnishing was added. Very little Nutella or chocolate in comparison to the Bellagio location's crepes.  The crepe maker was also less than friendly. Go to the Bellagio location just past the Conservancy.
This place gets five stars for charm alone. The cases are full of beautiful little pastries, chocolates, and gelato and everything seems so decadent. I couldn't help but stare at them every time I walked by. It seemed appropriate to stop for a little breakfast before leaving town. The coffee is excellent, but pricey ($5-6 for a latte). If you like brioche, try the dulce de leche or nutella variety. It's such a charming place that you'll want to stay awhile!
While in Vegas, my girlfriends that got there earlier told the rest of us about a crepe place in the Aria.  I'm such a huge fan of crepes that I had to try it.  I ended up going there in the early morning before my flight.  It was ambitious as I was pushing it a little with the timing.  Luckily the Aria hotel was not too far from the Hilton where I was staying so walking was not too long.  It did take awhile to order and get my crepe but the cashier did ask me if a 10-15 minute wait for the crepe would be too long.  . I did order the veggie savory crepe and did enjoy it but felt rushed trying to eat it.  I would definitely want to try one of the sweet crepes to see how those are also.  . JPP also does have other items on their menu like pastries, salads, coffee, etc,.. so plenty of items to choose from.. They are limited with seats but it wasn't a problem finding a seat.  . Since the Aria hotel is non-smoking it definitely helps in that you don't taste smoke while eating as the place is not closed off and right next to the tables.
