Love Earl of Sandwich.  While this is fast food it is delicious and better than your typical fast food meal.  I always get the classic, which is a roast beef and cheese.  The quality of the meet is good and the bread is fresh, perfectly toasted every time.  Lunch goes great with their soups, my favorite is tomato!  Best part is the cost, you won't go broke and you get a good meal.
Awesome sandwiches! I had heard a lot of this place so I had to try it out. Cool that it was open 24 hrs too! Great prices and very quick. Didn't think it was going to be in the mall, but that didn't matter. Very good!
Worth the wait. Line can be deceiving but it goes by quick, especially if you hit it up after a night of clubbing. This location is convenient bc it's 1) right across from Marquee in the Cosmo and 2) open 24 hours. Price is reasonable, a one-entree bowl at the Panda Express in Miracle Mile is more expensive than a sandwich here!. . Recommendations: chipotle chicken avocado and holiday turkey. I have a couple friends who swear by the Tuna melt too.. . Earl's sandwiches are perfect to enjoy hot and fresh, or even cold - aka the other half of the sandwich you'll be eating in your hotel room the next morning. To me, Earl's can do no wrong.
Turkey chili thick and not soupy, very flavorful. I could use more spice this between mild and medium.. Larry All American with chipotle sauce instead of ranch and it's very good.. Value for the money is off the charts for vegas.. It's located in Planet Hollywood inside and between Miracle Mile shops.. This is strictly a sandwich shop for a lunch or late night I had a huge lunch and didn't want a trad dinner so this hit the spot.. And my wallet had money for drinks
Honestly, I think people just like this place because: . . A) It's cheap, when everything else is expensive in Vegas. . B) It's open at all times for all the drunks. I liken eating the food here at 4 AM to the woman you're talking to at 4 AM - you likely wouldn't be going the same thing at noon. . . With that said, I'm probably not the best judge as I just got a tuna wrap and it wasn't any different from any other tuna wrap I've had. I don't eat most of what's on the menu at the place, so I am sure some of their meatier options are decent. . . Also, I am pretty sure a bottle of water here is almost $4. It's tough for me to support any supposedly economical place with that kind of pricing.
good food made right. long lines move quickly. slightly overpriced
I love earls!! I wished they opened one in the bay but it's a must have when in Vegas. They're open 24/7 so for all you clubbers n late owls this is the spot for you. I love the original but the chicken avocado is amazebawlss. The tomato soup hits the spot. Pretty much everything is good here!! Definitely recommend
The line is worth the wait. The name is well deserved too bc this place is certainly in the royal succession for best sandwhich in los vegas!
This was a really good sandwich. It was toasted perfectly and was just the right size. Will be back when visiting Vegas!
the premiere hot sandwich, Earl's has built an empire with these yellow bricks (of sandwiches).. . the location is amazingly convenient (which is one of the reasons why they get so much foot traffic). i've seen their lines stretch at east 30 or 40 people deep- breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the wait is well worth it. their ordering system is highly efficient (which is a relief), and although there may come a time where there isn't enough room in their dining area to enjoy your sandwich there, it's still just as satisfying if you take it to go and bring it back up to your room at the Westgate Towers or other nearby hotel.. . the tuna melt and hawaiian sandwiches are my favorite, but the jerk chicken or montagus are also great. much like the buffets, Earl's is a 'must try' for those enjoying Las Vegas for the first time. you'll find yourself always going back on subsequent trips to enjoy one of their hot sandwiches. and it's open 24 hours = makes a great breakfast or late night/post-clubbing meal as well.. . -civilities.
This place is seriously out of thisworld. I went based on the really high ratings, and now I know why it got so many. . . My husband and I ordered the chicken jerky and the full montagu sandwiches. Also, we got the coleslaw and potato salads. All items were so so good! I personally loved the chicken jerky more, but my husband loved the montagu better. Either way, you can't go wrong here. . . Next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely be stopping by. Prices are super reasonable as well! Win win. :)
Great lunch spot around town the restaurant quality is overall very high, prices weren't anything to scream about.  More attention to the food quality consistency and a more variable menu could add to this successful business.
A good sandwich, but not great.  I tried the meatball, BLT and original, none of them were exceptional.  I guess most folks don't know what an excellent sandwich really tastes like.
Cheap ($6.49)! Open 24 hours! Inside Planet Hollywood! Tuna melt sandwich! . . It's a decent sized sandwich, so it's definitely not going to leave you FULL (unless you're drinking a yard size Fat Tuesday with it). If you're going to get 2 sandwiches, I recommend getting the Full Montagu (beef, turkey, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard sauce). . . THE BREAD is seriously the best texture! Nice crispy texture on the outside, and soft/chewy on the inside! I'm not a bread person, but I don't get how the bread is SO good here?! . . *Tips* . - Come here if you want cheap food. - Add tobasco/dijon mustard to your sandwiches. - Get a Fat Tuesday and eat it with your meal :D . . Enjoy!
I have eaten here on numerous occasions when I come to Vegas. I always get the Tuna Melt Sandwich because in my opinion I think it is one of the best sandwiches on their menu and I'm not even really a big fan of tuna. I think all their sandwiches are good because it's the bread that actually stands out.  The cost is $6.49 for the sandwich. The chicken ceasar salad was $6.99 and not worth it's price. It is relatively small with a few chopped lettuce, very little chicken, some croutons, shaved parmesan and very little dressing that comes with it. You are better off getting another sandwich which is cheaper or adding soup to your order.  I've had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's pretty good. Soda is $2.49 but you get unlimited refills.  If you gamble and have a Diamond or Seven Stars Total Rewards card you can bypass the long lines and go to the front as well as use your points to pay for your meal. Don't worry, the line goes fast even if you do have to wait in those long lines.
Went to Earl of sandwich this past Saturday night, not sure what the hype is all about. It was ok. Not great. They gave us a beeper and we kept waiting and saw others that came after us get their food I finally went up and our food was just sitting there.  The buzzer never went off. Probably wouldn't go back.
This place is a must if you're going to Vegas to do the classic "club/party/drink-all-night-with-friends" thing on the strip. Or if you like sandwiches/food/life. Even if this place has a huge line, it moves fast and efficient. Just don't expect to easily find a place to sit and eat!. . The condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.. . You can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!. . Now, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese. . . But I would definitely go back again.
This place has really gone downhill in the last year. Customer service is bad & the sandwiches are just ok. They do make a pretty good salad but I just can't get past the attitude of some newer employees. I don't want these knuckleheads anywhere near my food.
Quick, easy, good. Took it to go for a late night snack.
Located somewhere in the clusterf*** of Planet Hollywood. Good luck finding it! I've come here probably like 3 times and I always have to ask how to get their.. . We came around brunch time...like 11 and it was pretty much empty. . You order your food at the first register and then make your way down to the second register where you will be paying. Along the way, you can grab drinks and other goodies such as chips, cookies and so on.. . I HIGHLY recommend the earl's club. It is absolutely perfect everytime I get it. The bread is to die for and it is just the right amount of food for a great price.. . My boyfriend and I also shared the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. It was really good as well, but i'll stick to the earl's club next time. He also got the cannonball for himself and LOVED it!. . We brought our friends here with us as well. It was their first time and they absolutely loved it. We spent $52 for 5 sandwiches, chips, and 4 drinks. . . Highly recommend checking this place out. Never disappoints!
Sandwiches amaze me. Earls? Not bad. It's definitely convenient because its fast, not messy to eat, somewhat filling, and convenient. Service there wasn't bad, the person who took my order was helpful in helping me chose... I tend to be indecisive and he was rather patient with me. I was in Vegas for 4 days and I'm surprised I only had Earls twice! . . The first time, I ordered the Full Montagu per friend's rec. and it was great! In terms of flavor it was rather heavy on the cheese side but just ask them for some chipotle sauce and BAM, you have yourself an hot, zesty sandwich.. . I also got one to go before I left Vegas and this time I tried the Caribbean Jerk Chicken... so. much. flavor! I loved it! I actually ate this the day after and it was still really good. Felt like a party in my mouth at work and I wished I had more :(. I bought my bf the infamous Chipotle Chicken Avocado and he loved it as well. . . all in all Earls lives up to its rep. sandwiches here are pretty good and inexpensive compared to a lot of restaurants in Vegas. I am craving one right now...
Earls of sandwich is DELICIOUS!!!  That's all I can say for now. They have not disappoint yet..
" About a 30 minute wait in line on a Friday afternoon... ". . FOOD: Sandwich was delicious! I enjoyed it very much for the very first time! The first bite was like wow, this is like no other sandwich! Yum....yum....yum..... . SERVICE: Rushy & direct.... . Definitely would be back, back, back when in Vegas again! ;)
love this place! open all night, the Hawaiian is as good as it gets!
The sandwiches blow your mind away. The Full Montague, the Earl's Club... You should try them all at least once. The first one I tried was at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.
I am in awe of the limited options of 24 hour places to eat in Sin City! We stayed at the Aria this past weekend and our only option was the Aria Cafe, which was open 24 hours but was a bit on the pricier end. We decided to take the tram over to the Bellagio and walk to PH to dig into Earl of Sandwich, which is also open 24 hours. . . Sandwiches will run you about $6.45 here. They're made-to-order, so they're toasty and warm. Plus, the bread is out of this world and the sandwich is a great fix at basically any time of the day. The lines move pretty fast, also. . . I opted to get the Original (which is basically what I get every time), and it doesn't disappoint. Use the horseradish/grey poupon sauce on the table for a little kick. . . Thanks for a fast, delicious, and cheap option... and for being open when everything else isn't!
Holy hell. . . If I could bring myself to do it, I'd bitterly give this place a single star for NOT being available in Oregon. . . But I can't. Because it's the best sandwich I have ever had. We came here at about 2am, and there was a line wrapped clear around the casino. We both had the ham and swiss. Very simple. Absolutely delicious. Loved it so much that we went back the day we were flying back home to Portland. I am SO glad we don't live in Las Vegas. I'd be at Earl of Sandwich at least twice a week, and my health would likely not forgive me (not to mention the rest of the amazing food that awaits you in Sin City). The soup is also to die for. The tomato... omg... wonders to behold. The prices are ridiculously reasonable. . . Planet Hollywood gets us into their casino because of Earl of Sandwich.
When it comes to sandwiches, this place is IT. It really is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Every time I am in Vegas, I go out of my way to eat here at least once, if not twice. I even tend to stay at planet hollywood due to the existence of this place and ABC market in the lobby. Just writing that sentence made me want to call PH and book my room right now. I have tried half the menu and EVERYTHING is good. I wish they would open more location, especially in LA. I hear there's one at downtown Disney in Orange County now. Be prepared for a longgg line if you are here on the weekend, no matter what time you stop by. At least the Gigantic Star Wars/WOF slots and the PH sportsbook next to the line will keep you entertained. Pretty sure even the off-duty Vegas escorts come here to dine regularly as well. Grab a 32 oz of beer from the ABC next door and prepare for one of the best quick lunches in your life.
Been here a few times, and each time I'm satisfied. The bread is always fresh (a big pet peeve of mine). Nice variety too. Portions seem fair for the price. Great for times when you don't want to sit and wait in a restaurant. . . Don't be fooled by the long looking line - it goes fast. I've always felt this is a good value. . . Not sure what else to say about a sandwich shop. Good luck - Cheers, keep swingin
The sandwich right there is unbelievable. Just need to spend around 7 dollars, you can get a sandwich with a lot of meats and cheeses.
Tiny sandwiches at normal prices after a long wait.. . If you find yourself at Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile and need a cheap bite, this is not a terrible stop.  But there is absolutely no reason to make the Earl of Sandwich your mealtime destination.. . The sandwiches are palatable, yet unremarkable, but what's most-prominent is that they are a half-sized sandwich.  That explains the pricing; double each cost to compare apples to apples.
Yummy I really really really liked their bread! That made a huge difference! I had the Caribbean jerk sandwich and I couldn't say what I didn't like about it. It is also fast and cheap. My friends recommended all American as well.
Hot sandwiches for a deal. Had the "Original" with Mediterranean salad on the side. Add grey poupon to the sandwich for a nice kick. Husband had the turkey club and loved it. Easy to find in the casino, it's right at the entrance to your left as you enter the main entrance.
Always a must have even though its not the best sandwiches.  . There is always a long line, no matter what time during the day.  Yes I understand. they are made ready to order, but sometimes waiting in line for 15-30 minutes. isn't worth it.. . Good luck on usually finding somewhere to relax with your sandwich, tables are usually if not always full, if you can find a seat consider yourself lucky, since around 2am with the clubs let out... its packed as hell in there
I was looking for a quick lunch while in Vegas and turned to Yelp to help me locate a good spot. I was in Planet Hollywood and this place had fantastic reviews, so the choice was clear. The only vegetarian option on the menu was the Caprese, which I wasn't in the mood for, so I asked if they had a basic veggie sandwich. It turns out they do and it consists of lettuce, tomato, avocado, black beans, cheese, and Italian dressing. I'm glad I asked! It was just what I was looking for at the time, and made even better by toasting it. At around $7, it was a great, inexpensive lunch.
Quick efficient service. There is no real interaction, but runs like a well oiled machine. That can be a good thing or bad, depending on the person I guess. I rarely ever order cold sandwiches so if you read any other reviews, it is usually always hot sandwiches. . We got the chicken, avo, bacon sandwich and Caribbean jerk chicken sandwich. The price is alright. When I first had it, it was really tasty, the taste of fresh warm toasted bread with a ingredients I enjoyed was perfect. so I wanted to pick up another the next day to save and eat on my drive back home. To my disappointment the sandwich had lost what made it tasted so great when it was eaten cold. The bread became hard to eat. . . Ive eaten it since but only if I was going to dine there but it hasnt been as amazing since
This place is open 24 HOURS, which is a good spot to come to if your hungry in the middle of the night in Sin City. . . Came here at 1 in the morning on a Tuesday and there was NO ONE, which was a good thing for my friends and I. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with a Salt and Vinegar bag of chips on the side. The sandwich was made fast, which was a good thing because we were really hungry. The sandwiches are okay, nothing special, only good thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours and the sandwiches are made fresh. . . NOTE: Located in the Planted Hollywood Miracle Mile Shopping Center and TRIPLE AAA cardholders get a discount, so show them your card by the time you pay for your food.
YUM YUM YUM. They always have a huge line going on but its worthevery second. I don't know what is so magical about them but they are addicting. I use to work at PBR Rockbar and the only good thing about that place was being able to walk right across to earl of sandwich on my lunch break!
This is place is delicious.  Always have to stop in whenever I'm nearby.  Everyone I have ever brought has been very happy!!!  The line is usually very long so plan on it taking around 15-20 minutes to wait and get your food.
I've tried Earl's both sober and drunk, and I enjoyed it every time :) . . I recommend the Chicken Chipotle Avocado sammich. It definitely hits the spot. . . It's open 24 hours and super affordable ($6-8).. perfect for your after-clubbing-drunchies! hehe :)
Seriously underwhelmed by their sandwiches.  With a name like that, I was expecting something over-the-top great, but they delivered...just normal sandwiches that, at best, I would consider a decent but not great value.  In short, I'd never go out of my way to eat here...and even if I was passing by I'd have to think twice.
I always make sure to stop by when I'm at planet Hollywood. The sandwiches are fresh, tasty, affordable, and quick. Can't go wrong with anything, really, but I prefer the club. The potato salad is decent, too.
The most amazing late night food. Every time I'm in vegas I eat the at least once a day . Turkey sandwich they got is killer.
I had the full montagu and coleslaw. The sandwich was good, but I agree with some of the other reviewers about the sandwich being small. It felt like more of an panni then a full sandwich. But that all depends on your appetite. If I came back with a friend I would order 3 sandwich and split it between the two of us. I am still hungry. Now for the coleslaw.....that was a good coleslaw, it was sweet, creamy, and fresh. I love their coleslaw and will get it everytime I come here. Overall it was a good sandwich/panni with a great coleslaw. I would come back and try the other sandwiches.....you should too and see if it's worth it
