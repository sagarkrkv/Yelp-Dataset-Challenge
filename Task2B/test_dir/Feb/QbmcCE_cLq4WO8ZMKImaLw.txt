So disappointing!!! Came in because I heard great things, read awesome yelp reviews, and the menu online was enticing. We had monorail passes so getting there was easy. My husband and I both decided on the hash since it's what they're famous for. I'm a foodie and almost always order what a place is known for.... it's supposed to be the best choice, right? WRONG! First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable "hash" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're "famous" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I'm allergic to dairy so there really wasn't any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband's would have gotten cold.. . The two stars are for the glass that I got to keep from my drink and for the server taking my meal off the check. Unfortunately, I don't understand the hype this place gets and I won't be coming back...
Like its sister restaurant in San Diego, the food at this location doesn't disappoint. I shared a plate of the fried chicken and waffles with my boyfriend during a trip. Just like home. Yum! I liked the fried scallions that came with the dish. I really enjoyed the play of sweet versus savory on the plate. May I suggest dipping your fried chicken in some maple syrup? We watched a neighboring table where each guy ordered a plate for himself. Needless to say, they all left with doggie bags since the portions are so huge. . . There were a few dings and that's why I rated this 4/5 stars. The restaurant was difficult to find and the hotel was undergoing some construction at the time. The service could have been better. The server did not check in with us to see how we were doing and was a little clueless as to the tip we left her. We chose this place to dine since we had a gift card to use. It was not valid at this location since it was purchased at the San Diego location who has separate ownership.
The wait time was decent & the servers/staff are friendly ! Jesus could've def came here when he fed the Multitude lol. Ordered chicken & waffles & it was a huge serving! I'm a glutton & I still couldn't finish it all! . The food was delish! Bacon bits in between the waffles def topped it off for my taste buds. The fried chicken was perfection! . Libation of choice : Tangerine Mimosa !
Highly disappointed. Was coming with super high expectations, and maybe that was my downfall. First off, we waited 55 minutes for a table. Once getting seated our waiter informed us that it would be another 45 minutes for our food once we ordered. I wanted to leave right then and there but we waited out of sheer desperation. They should at least give you some bread or something to munch on if you're waiting that long. I got the first farm Indiana special, which was sage fried chicken, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit.. The chicken was extremely dry, and the only hint of sage flavor was the dry rosemary they threw on top.. The BACON mashed potatoes was just mashed potatoes with two slices of bacon on top. Not horrible, but deceiving from the menu description.. I got my eggs over medium. They were good, but how hard is it to mess up eggs?. The biscuit was good, but very dry and sucks up any ounce of moisture in your mouth without any butter or jam or syrup. . The display was elaborate and pretty, ill give them that. And the portions were MASSIVE. But overall I'd save the money for this expensive meal and go to Denny's instead.
We loved this place. The only bad thing was that we couldn't get everything on the menu.  The portion sizes are giant and can easily be shared by 2-3 people.  Our server told us this before we ordered which was great because she wasn't trying to upsell anything! To be honest the prices are so reasonable that we each ordered a dish. My husband got the meatloaf hash and I got the biscuits and gravy. They were both amazing and giant portions but a great deal for the price. Go there,  try anything, you won't be disappointed!
Amazing amazing amazing...needed a great meal at 230am....the apple cinnamon banana pancake....holy wow!!!!.great service and ammmmazing food. Blue cheese hamburger amazing as well.
Been here 2x ... It's still the same place now called the quad and no longer imperial palace... Through the construction up the escalators and to the left. . . The first I went we had pretty much breakfast second time lunch but both times had the chicken and waffles... I have to say that I went with two different groups (breakfast there was 4 of us and 2nd there was only 3 of us) And both times we couldn't finish anything! The portions are so huge u can probably feed that family with 19 kids and counting lol. Ok maybe not that much. But I guess you can order 3 chicken and waffles and feed them all lmao. . . I'm not a big chicken and waffles fan. I'm more of I like chicken and I like waffles but not together. The chicken was fried but a bit dry. The waffles however was fluffy and infused with bacon! Yums! . . Other than that their menu is pretty generic.. Hamburgers, salad and meatloaf! Though all good portions nothing to brag about.
Hash house is the definition of over the top! The food is amazing, the portions are insane, and the value is unbeatable. I had one of their "favorite" scrambles (roasted chicken, corn, mozzarella) and it was fantastic. The crispy potatoes are not to be missed. Definitely check out this spot when you are in Vegas.
Huge portions, perfect hangover food, but the service was less than attentive. I'd go back bc the food helped clear up my hangover.
The food was extremely greasy. My portobello mushroom cap sandwich was basically just greasy spinach lettuce with the tiniest mushroom I've ever seen. When I complained to the waiter he said he'd bring me another but never did and then basically avoided us for the rest of the evening. We only saw him again when he brought our check. Will not be returning!
i think i could eat here everyday and never get over it. The food is from Heaven and the portions can feed a Lion.  Even the drinks are unique. A+ service also
I had the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict this morning and let me tell you that it is alot of food. I thought the fried chicken was very tasty but the whole ensemble of food is just a mish mash of odd flavors. You have the fried chicken sittng over eggs that sit over a southern style biscuit and mashed potatoes. Then they throw some sliced tomatoes and spinach and cheese and they pour this chipotle mayo over everything. This dish is probably popular because it was featured on "Man vs Food". Overall I would not order this dish again but you should probably try it because it is unique.
Went with party of 10 on Sunday for lunch. Estimated wait time was about 1 hour for seating and 45 minutes for food.. . Food ~ After waiting forever, of course I can see why this place is "amazing" as others posted since we're practically starving when our food comes. The portion size is HUGE so prepare to food coma afterwards. I shared the chicken and waffles with a friend which was perfect amount. There wasn't anything AMAZING about the chicken and waffles - I would say a little bit too dry. The syrup for the waffles barely helped with the dryness. HOWEVER, the watermelon lemonade was delicious! . . Location ~ It was an easy walk from where we stayed at (Vdara) especially since we were able to walk the strip and see all the stuff along the way. . . Atmosphere ~ Not much "waiting" room in their area so wouldn't recommend going with a big party like we did. Although, some of us went downstairs to gamble for a bit so that killed time. . . Overall ~ A good experience to check out but wouldn't come here again. The wait was too long and the food was okay. If you had limited time in Vegas like we did, we could have spent our 2 hours somewhere else.
must go! bomb breakfast! huge portions! friend chicken was the bomb! still full!
Solid place, great food, great service. We arrived at 8:30 on a Wednesday morning and had a 10 minute wait. By the time our table was ready the lobby was filling up. Definitely get there early if you don't want to wait long!. . The menu has a wide range of items. I got one of the farm scrambles (bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss). It came with a biscuit and potatoes. More than enough food. In fact, the portions here are insanely huge. One of my reasons for giving them four stars instead of five is because there is no need for portion sizes to be this large. It's pretty, and impressive, but ultimately it's just a waster of food. Most people leave a good amount behind.. . The other reason for giving them four stars is that the potatoes were not that great. They were not terrible but not worth any room in my stomach. I focused on my biscuit (excellent!) and scramble.. . My brother had the chicken and waffles. It was insane! Two pieces of fried chicken and four or more waffles. The waffles had strips of bacon inside them. We thought the added bacon in the waffles was fun, but again, an unnecessary amount of food that went to waste. Cut the chicken and waffles down to half the size and probably most people still couldn't eat it all.. . Our server was fantastic - some of the best service we had in all of Vegas (shout out to Billy). The host was not super friendly and barely made eye contact, but he was efficient. . . I do recommend going for breakfast. Price is very reasonable and food is delicious. It's prepared to order so expect to hang out a bit as they cook it. Well worth it!
This was an excellent meal. Only thing is cost of a dinky orange juice was $3.95! Would've almost been better off to but a beer. . . That being said, this place has awesome food and portions are very generous! Had the Goshen Scramble, with farm fresh eggs and some weird name sausage, but it was very yummy and tasty!. . Will be coming back definitely!
Food: good! Chicken and waffles and potatoes. Great portions and decent prices. . . Service: good for as busy as they are. . . Atmosphere: looks good but it is soooooo busy all the time and the wait sucks!!!. . We love this place but you have to be patient. Expect a 45 minute wait.
Great food, service, and price!. . When I was planning my trip to Vegas, I did some research on places to eat and this was very high on the list. One of the main reasons was because it was featured on Man vs. Food.. . My friend and I decided to eat here for breakfast and I wasn't disappointed at all. I decided to try the "Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict", mainly because this is what was featured on Man vs. Food. It had everything in it: mashed potatoes, bacon, cheese, friend chicken, egg, tomatoes, spinach, and a sauce (I think I probably left some stuff out). The portion was HUGE! For $18, this single plate could feed about 2-3 people.. . We also got the bacon waffles which were good. The waffles were light and airy with the bacon cooked in to it.. . Lastly, the Smore's Hot Chocolate was delicious! Take my recommendation; it's amazing :)
Loved it. Best place I went to in Vegas. Staff were so friendly and super relaxed. Bloody Mary with jalapeno stuffed olives wins every time. We went 3 times in 6 days. Can you say obsessed? Man vs food challenge was delicious. It's a Benedict but by the looks of it you have to dig for the eggs. The sauce is out of this world. One day I had the salmon scramble and it was awesome. Every thing we ordered was massive and could have been a man vs food challenge. I learned there's a hash house close to us in CT which means we are headed there ASAP. Yes you have to wait but it's so unbelievably worth it.
As I waited for my food to be delivered I couldn't help but to drool over all that was coming out the kitchen. Everything is such big portions and has succulent presentation. My friend and I shared a salad and the 18oz steak cooked medium. Price is great for the quality! I don't eat steak often but this was the best one yet! The veggies on the plate complimented the meal greatly. I requested the garlic potatoes instead of the pumpkin but was not fulfilled. My waiter brought out my desired side immediately and that was good. At one point of my meal I ran out of water and had to ask for my glass to be refilled. I didn't fuss too much about it. The atmosphere was very nice! I noticed the bar and the televisions displaying sports. I highly recommend and ill definitely be returning! Woohoo go farm food! Lol
Great service; large servings but great tasting food! Highly highly recommended and best of all, very affordable.
I first learned about this place on Man v. Food and Bacon Paradise on the Travel channel.  Since the first time i tried this place, Ive ate here about 3-4 times already.  I guess you can consider this as an accumulation review of all thetimes i have been here. . . Location:  There are actually two Hash House A Go Go in Vegas...one off the strip and on on the strip (this one).  The one on the strip is a hidden gem located on the second floor of Imperial Palace now known as The Quad.  Prepare to wait anywhere from 15 mins to over an hour.   Luckily they give you a pager so you can still wander inside the casino.. . Food: The food here in my opinion is actually pretty good.  The price is relatively cheap (most stuff are around $15 - $20) considering all the other places on the strip and the portion size are HUGE.  You can easily share one dish.  Hash House is known for their . . Sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower (bacon built inside the waffle).  Everytime someone orders this the room tends to get quite and people stare going wtf. . . Hash House Farm Benedict  (Seen on Man v. Food);. . BBLT (Imagine if you let someone who hates lettuce and tomato but loves bacon to build his own BLT with the only catch being there has to be at least one piece of lettuce and tomato...lol).. . The only thing i didnt like too much was their 1lb Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar stuffed burger.  The burger was very bland and lacked flavor.. . Overall this is a good place to go to if you don't want to spend too much money and wanna feel food preggo (if you dont share).
We really liked this place but had no idea how big the portions were! . . I ordered the sage fried chicken sandwich for my side I chose cheddar bacon mashed potatoes. Super good but I could only eat half of what I ordered. . . Its a really cool restaurant to take people who are visiting from out of town and look at their faces as the food arrives!
Very good, maybe the best pancakes I've ever had. Servings are giant and prices low. The Strip's gem for brunch, hands down.
Located at the QUAD Casino, the restaurant is upstairs so you have to take the escalator to get to the restaurant.. . Came here on a Monday morning at 7:30AM and the place was already half packed and the place only opened half an hour ago. We waited only 5 minutes before we got seated. Although it got really packed and a lot of people were waiting outside by the time my friends and I finished eating, which was around 9:30ish. . . As for the food, I got to say the portions are REALLY HUGE. I suggest if you come with a group of friends, you guys should share. One plate is enough to feed like two people. We only came to this conclusion after our food came out and we were trying to stuff ourselves because we didn't want any leftovers. We were so BLOATED afterwards that we didn't even want to move.. . The food it self is good and each plating has a very unique design. They are known for their FRIED CHICKEN, so order it! Their chicken has a very sweet mapley crunch taste. Maple reduction=syrup. My friends and I was so confuse what that meant when looking at the menu. We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Indiana Favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/Benedict, and Farm Benedict Hash House Original. NOTE: Their biscuits are HUGE but on the dry side, as well as their mash potatoes and for the waffles that came with fried chicken, it has BACON in it (YES, BACON!!!). Also that dish comes with fried leeks (long leafy onions), LOTS of it, so if you don't like them, ask for them on the side or something. My friend didn't really like it and it got in the way of while hewas eating his dish. . . Overall, I would come back again and this time I would know to share with someone instead of ordering a whole plate by myself.
This is my first time here and the food is amazing!!! I ordered the filet ribeye with polenta... Omg I just about died when I took the first bite! I can't wait to come in the morning for breakfast and try the egg Benedict plate which was featured on man vs food... Ahhhh I'm excited!!
We visited the location off the strip with some friends while we were vacationing. The biggest thing about this place that got me was the portions!! I could NOT believe how generous the portions are!! I ordered the corned beef hash and the hubs ordered the sage chicken, which were both very very delicious I will say! The hubs and I typically split what we order and share, but man, we were barely able to finish half of what we even ordered ourselves! I thought the decor and attire of the staff was fun, though when we came there was a DJ and I think it was a little loud. Overall though, enjoyed the meal, the place and would come back when I'm in the area again!
Be ready to wait if you're going to eat here. It's a decent size restaurant in Vegas but very popular especially since this one is on the strip. I suggest sending someone early to get a table and meet you later. The food is worth waiting for though if you love breakfast. The plates are huge! Decent price for the amount you get. If you don't eat that much I'd suggest sharing. The only downside is it's called hash house but they don't have the typical hash browns, they're dices potatoes. A bit disappointing on that note but one place if return when I go back to Vegas.
Had the Banana & Brown Sugar Pancake. Yes Pancake not pancakes. But man I really couldn't finish this AMAZING Pancake. I wanted too but just couldn't. I even shared it with wife and friends so that tells you how good and HUMONGOUS it was. One of our friends had the meatloaf sandwich and wow that looked amazing as well. My wife had the BBQ pork ribs those also , all together now AMAZING. The service was top notch very nice and helpful if it's your first time. Definitely a must to stop when in Vegas.
