Awesome place to study and hang out! The tables are large enough so you could throw your backpack's whole life on it! I love that there are different environments all in one spot. The ambiance is quite attractive! So far I've tried their soy dirty chai, soy vanilla latte, chocolatechip cookie, and the jalapeno Mac and cheese! Yummy!
The awesome thing about Phoenix that even most locals don't know about is how the best food places are discreet and tucked away. Lux is one of those places. I drove down Central countless times and never noticed it. Now, I can't stop pointing it out to others!. . I LOVE the vibe there. As soon as you walk through the double doors, people are scattered throughout the numerous couches, chairs, stools, tables, and futons they have, each with their own story. You have to seat yourself after you order your own food, so if you want a sit down dinner with some peace and quiet, maybe this isn't the best place. I still go on date nights because I love the atmosphere and the energy. Sometimes it's so packed that you have to sit next to a perfect stranger, but that's never bothered me. Going to Lux means being open - be open and you'll get the most out of your experience.. . The only grievance I have is that I wish they served breakfast longer because their menu is perfect! I swear by their biscuits and chorizo gravy, it is to DIE for. Their bacon is great by itself, too. Their black cherry Italian soda with cream my choice of drink, and their pastries change from day to day. I love being surprised with their choices each time I go. Place your dishes and cups in the plastic bin near the kitchen on the way out - clean your immediate area, place everything in that bin, and they'll take care of the rest. Again, some people hate that part of it, but I love it. I feel like I'm part of it all.. . Maybe it's "hipster" to some, but to me, it's a great representation of Downtown Phoenix: cool, relaxed, independent, yummy, colorful.
Grabbed a quick breakfast here before our flight back to Seattle. After asking about options without egg, they told me I could order the oatmeal. While I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of oatmeal that morning, I went with it since breakfast with an egg allergy is often a difficult - so one option is better than none.. . Holy hell, was I glad I opted for the oatmeal!! This might have been one of the best oatmeals I've had served to me yet! Served in a giant coffee mug, it was covered with a generous pile of warm toasted pecans and juicy raspberries, with a mingling of raspberry juice and (I think) maple syrup to sweeten the oats underneath. It was filling, it was simple, it was delicious, it was heavenly. . . As I board my flight back to my home hundreds of miles away, I don't know whether I love or hate them for setting the oatmeal bar so high when I can't go back every time I'm craving this decadent bowl of oatmeal. :). . Coffee was also good!
5 STARS for:. -Awesome straight-up coffee. -Great coffee drinks. -Fresh brewed iced tea. and.... -Atmosphere plus!  . . This is a great place to meet up with someone, or just to take some time for yourself, grab a beverage, read or get some work done using the free wi-fi, people-watch, etc.  The staff is always friendly, and there's never a dull moment once you're inside. So much to see, from the eclectic decor to the eclectic clientele.
Premium drinks. Whether I'm in need for caffeine boost or a relaxingpersonalized and seasonal cocktail. Have always been so pleased with their product!. . Food and pastry selections never disappoint.. . It's not surprising that this place is busting at the seams busy but I can't say that I've ever felt neglected or that their quality of service/product has suffered!
I find myself craving impeccable smooth coffee similar to Intelligentsia, Toby's Estate, Stumptown, Counter Culture, Blue Bottle, [insert  more brands to reinforce coffee snob elitism]... the whole artisan coffee scene that lacks in Arizona overall. I think Lux is the answer for Phoenix's market for  coffee connoisseurship and boutique roasting. . . Lux is industrial chic. Vintage industrial with soft touches of retro typewriters on tables. Its a muted scream of modernism without trying to hard. It's so effortlessly cool, clean, simple. The front side of the building facing East is all brick and hard to tell that there's even an awesome business running, let alone of what nature. Seems almost as if you have to be in the "know" to find it and hear about it. . . Everywhere are cute hipster boys and girls which makes me fall in love and turn into a total creep peering and drooling not so secretly. The bar is a nice touch that was much needed and I'm glad they've now incorporated that into the place. . . Coffee comes at the perfect temperature- not too hot where beans burn and leave a bitter sharp lingering muddle. The latte art is cool and a nice touch. You can get your coffe as a drip, chemex, French press.  Not sure about hario pour over or aeropress although I think they do have that option (unless I'm mistaken for a diff coffee shop in Phx area that offers that too). . Quality coffee is definitely prevalent. They roast their own coffee so you know it's fresh. The foam is always light and fluffy and not filled with too dense bubbles. Definitely lickable. They offer almond milk which is so refreshing as an alternative to soy. . . The music can get loud sometimes so I tend to venture into the back patio. I haven't tried Lux's food but I'm sure it is up there, and if not, Pane Bianco right is next door.. . My only one complaint (which I could care less about also) is that the line is a little akward when it gets backed up into the entrance but sometimes runs also into the middle of the room.
This is one of my guilty pleasures in Phoenix. The coffee, staff, atmosphere, daily food and pastry selection is absolutely amazing. If you haven't tried these yet (for those of us who love our strong coffee) I would recommend you to: Andy's 6-shooter and Dr. Lux:)
I can't get enough of this place. Love the coffee, the baked goods and the atmosphere. They're open late and if you're not in the mood for coffee, you can take a seat at their bar. Be sure to ask for a punch card. You get a free coffee after ten purchases.
The cinnamon roll was delicious. The white mocha is my favorite. Their homemade whipped cream can be added to any drink and I recommend it. The food menu items change on a daily basis. Wonderful place in downtown. Many options to eat and drink. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Great place to get work done or just hang out. Highly recommended!
Stopped in to grab coffee.  Freshly squeezed lemonade was quenching.   Cute spot with all kinds of hip things going on in there.  Food so good.  Parking is tricky.  Park in the back.  There is an outdoor picnic table area.  I would definitely come back to this place.  Love it!!!
Went to Lux on a Saturday morning for the first time. It was packed and the line was from the counter to the door. Lucky for me, I was in line in front of John a frequent customer who told me that during the week there is not usually a line and he is usually in and out. I ordered the Egg sandwich and a caramel latte both were very good and the prices were not bad. I was very happy that they offer both almond and soy milk as an option. I look forward to returning during the week  or on a weekend night and having a more relaxed experience.
Number one: there's too many hipsters, too many old people, and not enough cool people.. . Number two: why don't the people cooking food wear hair nets or hats?!. . Number three: what's with the stupid maze like layout? People always looked so confused in there as if they've all forgotten how to walk.. . Number four: the worst part of all, why do all the employees always look like they're way too cool to be nice and smile? Where's the customer service?. . Number five: I don't understand the middle aged bald DJ.... . Number six: I miss the old lux from 2006-2009 when it used to be cool.. . The end.
