Bally's is old people, the place has been around forever, of course it's not as new and shiny as Wynn, Cosmopolitan & Aria, but you're also not paying $300 per night either, so you get what you pay for, it's a room with a bed and bathroom, you're not in Vegas to stay in your room, you're in Vegas to gamble, drink and party!. . The Good:. Price. Beds. Staff. Jubilee Tower. . The Bad:. Cigarettes. Club Music. Construction. . The Ugly:. None. . All in all, it was a good value for the room, I would rather stay next door at Paris, but if they were booked, I would stay at Bally's again. The beds were super comfy.
Service sucks. Book couple room suppose to b all the same but it's not. One room was 3 and a half larger than out other room. Customer service was no help. This place is gonna lose costumes.
When I come to Vegas I come to eat and gamble. Hotel rooms are just for quick naps and showers. Bally's was offering me free rooms. How can I not say yes to that? They ended up upgrading my room to the jubilee tower free of charge because I am a platinum member. Yes All I do is gamble! Staff and dealers here are very friendly. Overall rooms were clean although when we first entered our non smoking room it smelled like someone just let a cigarette. Luckily I had a small bottle of freeze to take care of that. Bally's is conveniently located on the strip, which makes it convenient to any other casino.
My gf and I like to try a new hotel whenever we go to Vegas, but this past trip limited our options thanks to the massive real estate convention going on, which inflated average room prices two-to-threefold. As a result, we wound up picking Bally's because they had a great rate and my girl had stayed here once before and liked it. . . What we didn't know is that they're doing major renovations on the hotel street side facade. The escalator that leads down to the Strip is being torn up, making room for new shops and shit. This makes parking a bit of a headache, as you have to drive through a maze just to get into the main structure. But the good news is that it's easy to find a space near the elevators so you won't have to walk too far. . . The long walking comes once you hit the ground level, when you've got to walk through a concourse to Bally's since you're actually in Paris at the moment. Check-in was done at Vegas' usual slow standards. I found it annoying that the only king bed available was on the pet floor. If I book a king bed online, I should get a king bed on a normal floor. Luckily, this "pet floor" was quiet and clean. . . The rooms are pretty nice, maybe a bit antiquated. Furniture and fixtures looked like '90s relics, but it did feel comfortable. We had a decent view of the Strip from our side room, and the love seat by the window was easy to melt into. . . The pool is a major pain to reach. Take the elevator down to the ground floor, then navigate through their underground strip mall/food court before finally reaching the towel bar. It's a big pool, and surprisingly deep, hitting12' at the lowest point. We had no problem finding a couple of chairs. The pool bar was out of mint, so I was unable to enjoy a goddamn refreshing mojito, so I settled for a Shock Top. Bring plenty of cash if you're gonna drink here, because it ain't cheap. . . The hotel itself has few restaurants for a quick bite. We went out more often than we ate in, but the area between Bally's and Paris has a couple of food spots worth checking out. . . I can't say I'm in a rush to stay here again, but they did provide good service and a good room. Nothing blew me away, but then nothing turned me off so much I wouldn't come back. If you want mid-priced rooms in a good location (middle of the Strip), then this is the spot.
Be careful!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Someone might be already in your room!!. . They made same card keys for two groups. . When I opened my room, someone was already in there. . . !!!!!!!!!!!. . That means your baggage might be stolen anytime  by someone who has same card key as yours or someone might come in your room when you are taking shower!!! That's not safe at all!!!!!. . They didn't take this serious,didn't even show sincere apologize , just said"I can give you a free upgrade.". . We asked for manager, but they said manager was not at front desk. I asked them to tell their manager to come to out room to explain this situation, but he never showed up. . . That was my worst experience in Vegas.
I'd have given a better rating but the internet access & cost of it at this property is ridiculous.  I can go to Starbucks for free internet that is faster!  Shame on Bally's.  The hotel is currently hosting an eBay gathering. eBay is an online company. I'm betting the ebayers aren't happy. I wasn't.
Overall the experience at Bally's was great! Check-in was fast and staff was friendly! Room was clean, bed was comfortable, pillows were the perfect stiff to soft ratio, had plenty of towels, and very spacious! Bally's is going through some renovation right now so you do have to go around all of the construction in order to get to the strip. This was a little inconvenient but hey, they are just trying to make it a better place so it's understandable! The decor inside is a little dated but the comfortable bed and spacious room made up for it! This is definitely not Bellagio or Aria kind of nice but it is also at half the price! I barely stay in my hotel anyways. The location is also the selling point of this hotel! You are at the middle of the strip which is so convenient!
First, they overcharged us for our room. We walked in to book and were promised "best available" pricing.  After we agreed, we found the same room on the internet for half the price they quoted.  On top of that we had nearly $100 in taxes and "resort fees" for a two night stay!  The resort fees are a rip off.. . Second, the rooms were ok but no amenities like a coffee pot.. . Third, the room was nice but the rest of the hotel was quite run down.. . Fourth, the internet and lobby coffee were outrageously expensive.. . The only reason I give it two stars is that they allow dogs.
Service just about, 20min wait on wed check in, room is nice but bathroom door doesnt lock, moldy cabinet under the sink, no coffee machine,  luke warm water when it's 104 degree outside, maids come around 8:30am opening doors with their key then knocked every door, free wireless acess for one device with poor instruction and doesn't even work.  They should treat every customer as their first visit if they want returning  patronage.
2 Stars.  But I love this hotel.  Give me this over the Mirage any day.  Yeah it is clearly for the 40+ crowd.  The ones with all the money!  When I go to Vegas I pretty much stay at the hotel I am staying at.  But yes I am 45!!! And I am writing this at 2:54am.  but if I was in your casino, I would have little choice in food.  So the next day when you drag your ass out of bed and find that room service stopped at 1PM!!! (Sounds like the Elks lodge)...You get a little pissy.  Damn do you not get that when we go to a hotel, having your food delivered is special!  Open another restaurant and cook out of there!!!  And quit acting likes its 7pm on a Sunday in Ohio!
Was threatened to have my car towed because I stepped away for no more than two minutes to look for the valets. Had a 30 minute wait to check in. Despite what the website and signage tell you it costs $22 to use the gym. It's the year 2014 and WiFi costs $15 a day. Shampoo but no conditioner. Oh and when I walked into my room for the first time there was a blueberry in the bathroom sink. All in all Bally's made for a genuine WTF experience. With all the options in Vegas I say anywhere but here.
I asked lady at the lobby for three rooms with a view at hotel Bellagio. She said we have them but they cost almost three times more than a regular room. I agreed to pay extra money, however when we got to our rooms, only one had a right view. Two of them were looking everywhere but at the Bellagio. Also, your room i separated from other guests room only by the door, so if you have kids, I would not recommend to bring them to Bally's with you
