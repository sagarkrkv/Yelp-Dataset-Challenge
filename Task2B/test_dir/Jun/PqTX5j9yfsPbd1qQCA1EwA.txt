Went on a Friday night and there was a $20 cover charge for both males and females. Very reasonable compared to other clubs on the Strip.  I really enjoyed the music played and had fun dancing.  For those that are planning to get their drink on make sure to be ready spend $$$$$$$$  . Each drink was around $15 for well drinks, not sure how much beer is maybe around $7-8.
We went to Tao when they happened to have an hour of free drinks for ladies. The drinks were good but the servers had a bit of an attitude. It's kind of obvious that a lot of ladies go there for the free drinks and some of them were just kind of rude. . . A friend had gotten a little too much to drink and got escorted out so we decided to leave with her. The music wasn't really amazing but when we left, it was getting good. I really like that they have a balcony, it was really nice for pictures.
Been here plenty of times and they do deserve the 3 stars average rating. I actually came here for my 21st birthday making Tao the club that popped my clubbing cherry. Back in the day, before I was even 21, Tao was definitely the spot along with Pure. I think Tao and Pure really upped the game for Vegas night clubs. And Tao has been able to keep people coming in, but unfortunately Pure has not since it closed a few weeks ago. If I'm not mistaken Pure is going to go through a rejuvenation process with the Light group, we'll see what happens? And who could forget Tao being Kim Kardashian's spot for her birthdays and what not. Anyway, the last time I was here was last summer and I was expecting it to be less crowded than what I've experienced before considering Light and Hakkasan just opened that summer. BUT NO, the main floor is still super packed. I think this is a default place for a lot of people considering how easy it is to get on a guest list. That was also our reason, our group couldn't get anywhere else without the guys having to pay. None the less, the music on the main floor was pretty good from what I remember, but unfortunately we couldn't hang considering we felt like sardines in there. Most of the night if not all was spent in the hip hop room. We wanted to go upstairs to Tao beach, but we were told that area was close. Oh darn, that would of been nice just to rest our feet just for a few minutes and get some fresh air. Considering that Tao is still a decent club and easy to get into, I would recommend it to tourists who don't want to pay to get into the more popular clubs. Tao is still nice with the Asian/Buddha inspired decor, a fairly large size club and plays good music, you certainly can't go wrong.
Stay away from this nightclub. Do not buy the dinner and club package. What a waste of my money!! We were there on June 6 2014. I bought a package for 4 people.  Everything was fine and the area we were sitted at was perfect for a group of 4. Until, a group of 8 females walked in and were sitted next to us. Immediately, one of the woman, Christine or Christina (who claimed to be related to Elvis Presley) started to give us an attitude when we didn't move further down the booth. I asked the waitress if we could move to the corner part of the booth and she explained that it would cost more money. I explained this to the other group. We went along with our night making the best out of it until  Christine "Presley" came over to introduce herself to us and she started to call my husband a liar and disrespectful because he jokingly said his name was Pablo. Then she starts complaining to the couple that we were with about how they need to move further down because we were not by our table. To make a long story short, I asked her to please leave us alone and we were  moved to the corner to avoid any problems. Well this christine lady wasn't going to be happy till we were kicked out. She kept whining to the bouncers and waitresses accusing us of being mean to her and throwing ice at her. All of which were a lie. What irritated me was how security handled the situation.  They came and took me from my party, didn't let my husband or friends follow me, and basically held me hostage in an exit hallway. They took my ID and threatened to call the cops over what occurred.  Nothing occurred!! A fight didn't break out, no punches were thrown,& our party  was not paying any  attention to this girl. They wouldn't give my husband any information on my whereabouts. I was held against my will for almost an hour till security could figure out what to do. I have been to plenty of clubs in Vegas and Chicago, never have I seen security pay attention to such childish complaints!! I couldn't believe they were taking this Christine seriously when she was whining about not having an extra 6 inches to herself.   If anything I blame the club for sitting a group of 8 in a booth that only fits 4. Thank you to security for wasting an hour of our night instead of either asking us to leave or letting us go down to the dance floor. If it wasn't for the fact that they had my ID and my husband's cc we would have walked out. I thought Tao's VIP was suppose to be classy instead they allow little girls playing childish bs games and give them too much attention. What a waste of money and time! To that Christine girl I wish I would have given you something to really complain about because you obviously have never encountered people who will give you a reason to get security.  Dinner at Tao wasn't great at all. The food is not worth the money. The club is by far the worst I have been to and I wish I would have listened to some of the reviews on yelp.
I must say,  I lived in Zvegas and partied at some amazing places and never visited this one. So, in town for a last minute vacation with another couple of friends and we decided to come here on Saturday night. I have visited NYC, and LA Tao and I needed to check this one off the list.. . My friend decided he wants to ask his girl to marry him, so my wife told the folks at Tao to sit us in a nice table. To start off, the place is nicer than all the other Tao's I have been to. the atmosphere is pretty ultra Asian modern. The music is chill, and the people are all having a great time. I knew that I was going to like it. . . we sit in a cool spot, ordered a few rounds of drinks, which were on point, ordered some apps, the usual edamame, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and something else. All very good. I ordered the strip med rare, with some veggies, my wife ordered the seabass and it was amazing. the drinks kept flowing, and then it was time. my boy got on his knees and asked the Question!!! She said yes, the staff came over with Champagne and served everyone and congratulated the couple.. . Then they invited us to the nightclub on them. We declined because there was second question, will you marry me tonight BAM!!! Only in Vegas. So we ran out the place looking for a Chapel.. . Net Net, Tao exceeded our expectations and went our of their way to make us very happy clients. A guaranteed stop on my next trip.
This place rocks! I love the variety of music they play, the low 20 dollar cover charge, and the good-friendly vibe. One thing I wish they would've provided is seating areas with no charge lol. I know it's Vegas and I guess clubs expect everyone else to stand and only the rich may sit but give us a break we pay to get in and spends hundreds on drinks and least have a concrete bench or something to take a quick breather. . . Drinks start off at around 15 dollars and if you tip your bartender well, they will serve you quick.. . Restroom lines are about 15 minute wait for guys and girls probably 20-25 minutes.
Holy wow! This place was absolutely gorgeous and was a ton of fun! There was a foam rain,  insane amounts of confetti and a man dressed as a disco ball! The decor is fantastic and I can't wait to get to go back!
I absolutely love the idea/theme/decor but I feel like it's a bit of an older crowd. There were two dance floors with not much action going on. I came with a group of 5, 4 girls and 1 guy, and one of the dance floors was GIRLS ONLY, what? That's cool for bachelorettes, but not those that have boyfriends or just wanna dance with the opposite sex. The staff was really friendly too. Just disappointed I couldn't get my dance on. Ended up leaving because we were bored after 45 minutes.
