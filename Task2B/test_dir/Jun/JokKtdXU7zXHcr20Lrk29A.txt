This place gets busy and with good reason it is very good. Great selection of beers! Our service was awesome even though the place was packed full. Had the fish and chips and it was very good and were the wings. Bathrooms are kinda lacking but thats minor in the over all picture. Huge outdoor patio is also available. Will be going here as often as we can!
My friends and I stopped in to Four Peaks for dinner Saturday night after attending an event at a much-less appealing food-wise beer bar. I'm so happy we did - I'd honestly forgotten just how much I love this place. Granted, school is out so we are able to park reasonably close and actually get seated right away - however even if we didnt, i'm sure we still would have had a great experience. Our waitress was just wonderful, she was so friendly and attentive. We had all the seasonal beers - the Red, the Saison and the amazing Short Hop and Double Knot. I really wish Double Knot was available in stores, that is one amazing brew. Our food was equally delicous - we actually tried the new calamari app and were in LOVE. We'd all been to San Diego together last year and honestly the dish was prepared so well it reminded us of the calamari we had right on the beach in SD. Really great - we also had the Italian Beef, French Dip (Prime/Irish) and the Salmon BLT. Everyone loved their meals and of course the beer-battered fries that accompany them are excellent as always. This is a brewery that is run like a restaurant but with amazing beer - really a great place and its no wonder there are now 4 locations in the Valley.
Great beer, nice staff, and pretty good pub food (I kinda love their spinach dip). This place gets super busy for a reason. I LOVE the peach beer. Kilt Lifter and the Hop Knot IPA are great, too.
It goes almost without saying, that for a brewpub... Four Peaks has it down. Food menu, beer pairings, and service is always consistent and very good.
It's a massive jam jar full of delicious, hang over fixing, spicy, beery, Bloody Mary. It's topped with a pickle, olives, lemon, lime, sausage links and a damn breakfast sandwich. It's brunch, it's a snack, it's fucking amazing. I saw it sitting next to me, and I blushed like a virgin.. . On a Sunday early afternoon, the place was lively and full of happy brunch folk. Great atmosphere for beers and food and watching whatever sports you like on tv. Everyone behind and around the bar was friendly and engaging in conversation, pretty much everyone felt like a friend. . . I would totally come back! Again and again and again...
Four Peaks in Tempe is kind of located in a strange place. Next to Uranus Recording Studio's owned by Robin Wilson of The Gin Blossoms, it's nicely hidden away in a suburban street. Lot's of outdoor tables and has a unique vibe to it, especially since it's not bogged down with tons of bars and business right next to it. . . I honestly come here for food more than the beer. Don't get me wrong, the beers are great, unique, and good in variety! But the food here to me is out of this world! You would see me here eating their food with water before you would see me putting away beer. Portions are usually pretty big, so keep that in mind. . . There's almost always a wait to be seated. The servers have overall been on point, with 1 bad experience from a server. I will say that was just a really random experience because it's never happened again. . . Also is great in terms of cultural diversity. Lots of ASU transfers and students from out of the country come here. There are a lot of Indian and Oriental students that visit depending on the time of year. I have had some great conversations with some people. Easy way to get some insight about their culture! . . Long Story Short: Come for the food, stay for the beer and diversity of people. Expect a wait. Drink responsibly.
Best brewery in town and most popular. Parking straight up sucks. I usually park in the back behind the warehouse, but most likely you will be parking far away. All the beers are pretty famous already, but I specifically love the saison they have. They only have it on tap at the brewery. So it's a great treat for me when I go because they don't sell it any other way. Another favorite seasonal beer is the pumpkin porter, it's amazing! If you get the chance to grab one, grab 2 or 3 and a six pack. Food is really awesome here too! Never have been disappointed, and the staff is very accommodating and friendly. I  home brew my own beer so I love the warehouse atmosphere here eating and drinking while watching them make beer and staring at the huge conical fermenters. Everyone that's visits Tempe, must visit this unique brewery.
That I would find such a phenomenal brewery nestled away in Tempe, I'd never guess.. . I rolled into Tempe over one blistering weekend to undergo orientation for an upcoming summer job. We walked "downtown" the first night to explore the two or three blocks of action to some disappointment. Sure, it's a decent college town, but nothing was particularly unique about the offered venues.. . Our next and final night a like-minded friend scoured the area for local breweries and unearthed this gem. Thank god we waited until after sunset to make the mile and a half slog or we may not have been able to enjoy the incredible offerings of Four Peaks.. . Small disclaimer: we only ordered the beer, but we literally tried all of them - a flight plus the seasonals, the latter of which were offered us free of charge after we displayed some interest in knocking off the whole sudsy menu.. . First, the flight glasses are a good size. I've been to breweries where you're lucky to get an once, but they give you quite a bit to mull over with each sample at Four Peaks. They even have custom wooden tablets that they serve the drinks on, showing a confidence in their menu that is well-earned.. . There was not a miss in the whole bunch. One or two I'd be hesitant to order a pint of, perhaps (particularly the stout in summer), but nothing that I wasn't happy to try a second sip.. . The star of the show was the Peach Ale. It tastes like a commercial would read: crisp, refreshing, takes the edge off those hot summer days. The peach flavor is clear and accommodating without being overpowering and my friend and I each ordered two more pints after the flight was through. I seriously considered grabbing a growler to dazzle my friends back home, but the cost of the growler - plus the fact that I would be shelling out another $25 for a check-in bag I didn't need on the way over - proved too much.. . If the beers alone didn't earn 5 stars (and they do), the management would. We had a few questions about the floral notes of one of the beers, and on asking to speak to a brewer, the manager came over to answer our questions. I wish I hadn't waited so long to write this review as his name now escapes me, but I'm thinking...Jeff? Four Peaks, if you're reading this, he was managing a Saturday night a little under a month ago, and he was AWESOME. We talked at length about the nuances of the different beers and he even treated us to a small sample of some of the cask-engine brews (a first for me!). He went above and beyond on a busy Saturday night and brought the evening to the next level.. . There is very little that could bring me back to Tempe. The temperature was sizzling and I'm way too far out of college to venture into that scene. . . But Four Peaks? . . Maybe...just maybe...
I passionately love this place with all of my heart. No, I am not being paid by Four Peaks Brewing Co to give this place an excellent review. I admit that I don't come here every weekend to drink or dine here but when I do, the food and drinks here always come out delicious. I love the fact that they brew their own beers too. Price wise, it seems like a lot but if you think about the portions that they give you, its quite worth the price. I definitely recommend this place for some quick food or some very good drinks! Its a good bar to start too, if you want to casually drink with friends.
Four peaks has good food...good beer..good people..it's the best ! Dani is the best server here !!!
Great food and a nice atmosphere. A bit heavy but delicious. Arrive early - there is frequently a long wait for table seating.
My favorite place.  We everything is excellent. . The food,  the beer, the bloody marys and service.  I come here very often.  Their Sunday brunch is also very tasty.
Everything, every time is amazing. Order anything, you will not go wrong. It can be a little loud and crowded so be prepared but you can order a delicious beer from the bar while you wait. It is worth it. Delicious food and great staff!!
So in search for a great gluten free place I ended up here because the rest of my party wanted beer.  I was a little hesitant because being gluten-free I know that most Brewing Co's/Pubs do not have very many selections for me.. . The place is kinda cool, huge fans going and the temperature was comfortable.  The waitress was actually knowledgeable about gluten free which was great.  She even asked me first I had an allergy or if this was just a lifestyle choice (fair question BTW).. . Anyway I ended up with a Popper Burger with no onion straws (Fresh, sauteed jalapeno, onion straws and cream cheese) served on a bed of lettuce with onion and tomato.  Instead of the fries I had a side salad.. . First I need to say that the servings in this joint are HUGE!  I was astonished and the plates that were coming out of the kitchen.. . OH they had Woodchuck Cider on tap so that was another quick pleaser for me!. . Finally the burger arrived.  IT WAS AMAZING.  No joke.  The combo of flavors were great, I have no idea what kind of meat but fantastic quality.  It was cooked to perfection at medium rare.  I think I can honestly say that this may be the best burger that I have ever had.  Price, appearance, flavor.............yes, yes, yes.  It was outstanding and I left with a full belly and a desire to go back ASAP!!!. . EXCELLENT burger choice and good for gluten free too!!
I really love 4 Peaks beer. Also love the Tasting Room. Therefore, 2 stars. Unfortunately, the 8th St location sucks. Would give it zero. Showed up today to do a girls night with 7 ladies. So I didn't realize it would be a bastion for soccer hooligans during the World Cup. Actually my bad, I really didn't think about it. However, when I got there ahead of time to get a table, it was only me. They said they wouldn't seat me until most of our party was there. Of course, it's 120 degrees out so... I asked where I could wait. The bar. Bummer, the bar was shoulder to shoulder. I literally couldn't even enter the doorway. So, I asked if I could grab a table to wait. Nope. I had to sit outside with the fiery sun torturing my delicate Irish skin. Want to know why they get a bad review? THERE WERE 20 OPEN TABLES AND NO ONE IN LINE. That's right. They made me sit outside in the sun instead of letting me sit at any of the numerous open tables. I promptly took our business to Casey Moore's. Never returning to Four Peaks. I don't even know if I want my beloved Kiltlifter anymore.
The beer selection was a little limited compared to some other breweries with pretty basic choices, but they were still very good beers.. . The nachos = to die for. get blackened chicken, trust me.  The beer bread chicken sandwich was also very very delicious. tender, moist, juicy, delicious.  my mom got the cobb salad and i had half of it and it was very good too as far as salads go.. . Im definitely going back, and getting two orders of nachos.
5/5
HANDS DOWN BEST BEER IN ARIZONA! Place is always packed but still always get amazing service and food every time! I can't  get enough of their different types of beers and I always take a growler full of beer home every time I go. Killer burgers and apps that come out very quickly. I live on the opposite side of town from the Tempe location and still drive all the way out there to grab a bite to eat!
Very busy but well worth the wait! I'm from Los Angeles & this place would probably be the reason I'll visit Arizona again.
Best brewery in AZ
I went to four peaks yesterday and have to say they are awesome. My wife and I went and I had an American red (seasonal). The beer was great, as they brew in house. The food was amazing. No wonder this is a local favorite in that area. We will 100% be back. The staff was awesome, atmosphere was phenomenal just all around a great experience!
I love Four Peaks......I love you Hop Knot, you're my one true love.
Beer selection here is MONEY.  Spent all day yesterday drinking and eating for the USA game. Great place. #8thstreetale
Great food, beer and atmosphere. In the summer you gotta try the peach beer (seriously) and in the winter they make a milkshake out of their stout. Don't worry, it doesn't taste like a beer. The only con is that parking can be tricky but that's true of the whole bar district.
Awesome place to go for beer, mingling, a date, whatever! We had the beer sampler, let me just start by saying I'm not a huge beer fan, my husband, however, is, and we were both so impressed by all the beers we tried. We had just gone to another local brewery that left me a bit disappointed, but Four Peaks did not let us down. Great beer, great atmosphere, and pretty delicious pretzels :)
My favorite place whether for dinner or just beers.  This is where I take out-of-town visitors because it's always guaranteed to please.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Everything they serve is fantastic from burgers to pizza to dinner specials.  The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had, and all of their beer bread sandwiches are delish.  They make excellent beers too, way better than other local breweries.  Never had bad service here.  Parking can be an issue but I have always managed to find a space in the back.
I always want to take people from out of town here. Great beer and amazing food! The fries are to die for. They have good vegetarian options, especially for pub food. It gets pretty crowded around 6pm but if you go before or after there won't be much of a wait.
It gets 5 stars compared to other breweries I've been to. Great beer, good service, and surprisingly tasty food.  Even if you aren't a beer person, it's worth checking out for the atmosphere and food! And yes it's mostly street parking, but it's not frustrating at all :)
I'm not a fan. Their beer isn't my favorite, and their food is sub-par. I haven't had problems with the servers, but the bouncers have really poor attitudes. I'm not someone who ever has issues with security, so a bouncer really has to go out of his/her way to make an impact on me, but I will not be back. I want to go out to have a nice time, not be insulted by someone on an ego trip. There are so many awesome breweries in the valley, I would definitely recommend going somewhere with better beer and friendly staff. Sleepy Dog is awesome! Also, Huss, Arizona Wilderness, Pheonix Ale, Papago, Desert Eagle, Gordon Biersch, Nimbus...
