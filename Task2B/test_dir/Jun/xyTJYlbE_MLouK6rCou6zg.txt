Came here when I stayed at Mandalay Bay. I called to make a reservation but they told me they don't take reservations. I told them I was staying at Mandalay and would be walking down from my room.  They said since I was staying at the hotel they would put my name down so I wouldn't have to wait long once I got there. I waited for 3 mins and was seated. I built my own burger with the Kobe beef. It was amazing. The sweet potato fries were good too. I would definitely come back.
Stopped in for lunch during convention. Pricy burger but it's vegas cooked perfectly and value for money when u compare it to the food court at the convention center. I recommend the creamy peppercorn  sauce and pineapple on the lamb burger. I wii be back
This was a good place only went one time don't know why I haven't been back but it was really good everything was clean and fresh there
I went to Vegas in January. . I ate here the majority of the time. . These burgers were the shit, dude! . Very fresh, and well prepared. I don't quite remember what I got on most of the burger. Can you blame me?. My family came to Vegas before this time, and said this place was awesome. They did not lie.
This place came highly recommended by my good friends who I consider to have great taste in fine cuisine. We went for lunch and ordered the Kobe beef burger (cooked medium), with the onion bun, brie, grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes. We also added truffle mayo and chipotle aioli sauces on the side with fat fries. . . The patty was juicy and pink all the way through. It would have been perfect, HOWEVER, it was a little underseasoned. We had to constantly spread sauce to it. The fat fries were well cooked (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside). All the extras complimented the patty well. . . Since today is National Donut Day, we ordered the sweet Nutella donut burger, which is basically a Nutella patty enclosed in a Krispy Kreme glazed donut. It had strawberries for tomatoes, kiwis for pickles, and a passion fruit jelly slice for cheese. HOW CUTE, and delicious. It wasn't as rich as I thought it would be. . . TL;DR: burger was good, patty a little underseasoned. Get one of the dessert burgers!
quick dinner before flight home. built my own with a regular patty, cheddar, grilled onions and portabellos- I agree that the flavor of the meat was good. couldn't see paying $22 ++ for a signature burger. get the truffle mayo!  onion rings were good. fries were nothing special.
This place had some of the best burgers I have ever eaten. . . . Their fries were fantastic!. . I would highly recommend the Jalapeno Onion Rings.
After much debate we decided to make our own burger rather than choosing one of the burgers straight from the menu. . . I chose the barbecued marinated beef with bacon,  sauteed mushrooms and blue cheese.   The Burger was juicy and cooked to perfection at a medium grill.   I could tell the beef was high quality however I couldn't taste any type of bbq marinade.   The bun I chose was the pretzel bun which was just the right texture,  chewy and tasty. . . Sol chose a grass feed beef burger with bacon,  a fried egg and American cheese.  He had it put on a chibatta bun.  He had his burger well done which to me is too done but to each his own. . . We also split a sweet potato fry.  Sol also ordered a side salad which was very disappointing.   It was lettuce and vignette,  that's it.   No other toppings.   Weird. . . We drank water.   Alcohol drinks were on the menu for $12.50 each.   Milk shakes were $9 each.   They were good size but yikes!   Even the tea was $3.95, really?  For tea?   . . Our bill was $50 for 2 hamburgers, 1 order of fries and 1 side salad.  Even though the food was good,  it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home. . . Two thumbs up for the burgers.  Two thumbs down for the prices and the side salad.   Fries were fries.
Burgers...Good. Drinks....Good. Waiter...Good. Hostess...Bitchy.. . Note to Hostess - Invite us in the restaurant instead of being on your cell phone and talking to each other.
Very good service. Friendly people but it's still a hamburger. You get several choices of  toppings, over 30 at least. About 100 beers to choose from but it's still a burger and a beer $50 bucks plus tip.
Excellent Vegas burger joint! I built my own Buffalo burger with spinach and truffle mayo, prepared medium rare! Burger heaven by all means!
Wait. Wait some more. I hope it's worth the wait. Still waiting. The hostesses have attitudes, why? So hungry. Still waiting. Glare from hostess. Wait. Was that my stomach making that noise? Wait some more. Do I hear the theme song to Jeopardy in my head?  Finally, our table is ready! . . I am starving, so I will let the rude hostesses slide, lets do this! I order the Vegan Burger, which I know you are now thinking to yourself, what a dumb veggie head and you will now discount my whole review....... Well here it is. It was just meh and I have had better. All the veggies were grilled but the whole thing was so greasy that I had to use a fork to eat it. What didn't help it was the side of fries that were cold. So looking back on my evening, I should have just stuck to ordering a milkshake and possibly that would have turned this into a three star review, maybe.
Yes, yes, yes!!! Red Velvet Milk Shake... This is surely the beat thing I have tasted in all my ** years of life!!! If you love hamburgers and/or milkshakes then you should make your way here! I had a quesadilla and I dont remeber much about it because my heart sang and the heavens parted as I savored my milkshake!! Spiked Milkshakes... Need I say more
Fantastic Burgers,.....
I was recommended this place by my brother-in-law who actually came here 3 times during his last visit to Las Vegas because it "was that good".. . After a brief stay at Daylight (the Mandalay Bay Beach Club), my group came here to grab some lunch. Burger Bar is located inside the Mandalay Bay Shoppes (it's sort of in the middle of things so be prepared for some walking).. . Though without a reservation, we were quickly shown to a booth inside the restaurant upon arriving.. . Service was superb. Our waitress was super attentive, fast, and kept our waters/sodas refilled throughout our stay. . . I ordered a custom burger, choosing the Kobe beef option ($17.50 just for bun and meat - lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion are served on the side), and grilled onion (which was about a $1.00 upcharge). I chose to get my burger cooked medium rare and that was that.. . When the burger arrived, it did not disappoint! It was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had - simply tender, juicy, and wonderful with each bite to the last. There was no need to add cheese or anything fancy to this burger - just make it medium rare and have some onion and you are set.. . Though definitely pricey, Burger Bar is an awesome eatery and I look forward to returning my next visit to Las Vegas.
Burger a composer soi meme, le mien (avec un patty de dinde) etait tres bon! Les frites aussi, j'ai goute les classiques et celles de patate douce.
Other reviews that mention the rude hostesses are spot-on. I second-guessed my decision to eat here because my introduction to this place was these nasty girls. They acted annoyed that they had to stop their conversation to seat my group and even more annoyed that we requested to be seated in a booth instead of the cramped table in the middle of the room. Booths were wide open, by the way. The waitress was very friendly and helpful, but the bad taste was already in my mouth. The burgers were good, but not good enough to raise the rating to 4 stars after the unwelcoming attitude of the hostess. There are lots of great burger places in Vegas, and at least they act like they're happy to have your business. I'll be going to one of those places next time!
Great little sliders and a fantastic selection for beer. . . Sit down, watch a few innings, try a new beer and get a bite. Pretty cool place if you are on your way to mandalay bay from Luxor.
This place is pretty amazing. Burgers exactly how you want them, fries, shakes, and even turkey and veggie burgers that are awesome! . . To start: fry sampler with 5 sauces. White BBQ, cinnamon honey mustard, garlic aioli, truffle mayo, and a second white BBQ. The white BBQ sauce is magical (if you couldn't already tell). I also tried the sliders, which are tender little bites of hamburger heaven on a mini-bun. Macaroni and cheese bites are pretty good (not my favorite) and the sweet potato fries are to die for (try them with the cinnamon honey mustard sauce! Mmmmmm).. . For burgers, the surf and turf burger is a juicy burger with asparagus and large prawns on top. The hubby always gets the bison burger, with the works, and a "black and white" shake (read: large chunks of cookie dough that you have to suck through a supersized straw). . . Service: can be a little slow on busy nights but honestly the food more than makes up for it in the long run. The price is a little high, but Hubert Keller does not disappoint with his recipes and burger-fusion! Enjoy!
After reading all reviews on burger places in Vegas, we decided on Burger Bar. Not disappointed. The poblano poppers were delicious. Each of 6 poppers is served in a shot glass with a creamy aioli sauce. Great presentation and soooo good. I did not have a shake, as I opted for alcohol, but the other 3 people in my party did. Again, great presentation and creamy, deliciousness. The burgers were tasty, made with high quality beef. The choices for types of meat and add-ons are plentiful. The margarita I had was one of the best I had in Vegas!  Friendly staff, great food. You gotta try it!
This place just falls into that "it's oky if I gain the weight because it was that good category" . They have wide selection and many different varieties. You can not go wrong here!
Delicious!!! Friendly helpful staff, crazy milkshake combos and gourmet burgers. I got the perfect 10 Gouda cheese Carmelized onions on a pretzel bun!!!! Sweet and savory with sweet potato fries. And they have a bunch of different dipping sauces!!! I chose cinnamon honey mustard for my fries. Uhg I need a nap now
I wanted a good burger and got it here. It was cooked to order. Staff were nice....not jerks and not trying to rush you or pressure you. I really liked the onion rings and options for your burger.
Gordon Ramsey's BurGR gets all the credit around here, but I honestly enjoyed Burger Bar more, and the price compared to most places on the strip made it all that much better. . . Burger Bar is tucked away in a mall between the Luxor and Mandalay bay, across from a Lush and next to an Irish pub type place. There are plenty of different options here that you would find at your regular burger place plus a few added extras.  My boyfriend got the kobe burger and really liked it.  I wasn't too hungry so I opted for a fry sampler to split with him (the fries were good but I mostly munched on the fried pickles of the one we ordered) and I built my own milkshake.  I have never tasted a milkshake so amazing before.  I dream about returning to vegas and enjoying another strawberry chocolate shake.  . . If you're in the area, definitely check out Burger Bar.  For the price, it's well worth it!
Always enjoy the Burger Bar.  Before all the high-end burger places in Las Vegas, Burger Bar was the original.  What I especially like are their onion rings and milkshakes!
Vegas Burger Perfection!! Burgers are great, tons of beer options. Die and gone to heaven Milkshakes, and very consistent service. This place will knock your hangover to the curb and prime your liver for another Cirque Du Soleil alcohol carnival!! I can't mention this place without referring to the two sisters that work there who are devilishly sexy and insanely good at what they do.
