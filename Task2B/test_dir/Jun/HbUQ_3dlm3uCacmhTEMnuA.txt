Went here for a friends bday dinner. Service was great, shout out to Edgar and Justin, but the food was just ok. For appetizers we had lobster salad, shrimp cocktail, and the Bibb wedge. I think the appetizers were the best part of the meal. Lobster salad was delicious as was the Bibb. My friends each had the 18 oz ribeye while I had the 10 oz filet. We shared sides of risotto, eggplant, and mushrooms. The sides are definitely big enough to share. My steak was good, nothing memorable. My friends felt the same about their ribeyes. Risotto was on point though. And for dessert we had monkey bread, souffle, and we tried all the sorbets they had. Monkey bread was disappointing. Was way too sweet and trust me I love sweets but this was hard to eat. Souffle was grainy we didn't even finish it, but the sorbets were nice and refreshing. Being a big fan of Tom Colicchio I guess I was just expecting more.
BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE!. . Went there for our "splurge" anniversary dinner. Everything from start to finish was amazing. We had a reservation and were promptly seated in a nice cushy booth. The restaurant was packed, but it wasn't the usual "so loud I can't hear anything you say" loud. Our friendly waiter brought my perfect Dirty Martini quickly and made great recommendations on the menu.. . We ordered the Chef's Selection package which was pricey--but again totally worth it and a TON of food.. . We selected the Kobe cuts of the NY steak and Rib Eye with a side of 1/2 a lobster. The lobster was a decent size and wonderful; and both steaks were melt in your mouth delicious and so perfectly prepared, I might never be able to have "regular" steak again. . . The package came with a ton of sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment, a potato gratin and 3 (!) salads the highlight being the Buffalo Mozzarella salad. It was actually way too much food, but everything was amazing.. . I've read some complaints about the photographer, but since it was our anniversary, I didn't mind. She was a bit overpriced, but the photos are very high quality and a nice momento we wouldn't have otherwise gotten.. . All in all, a perfect meal and evening. Just writing this is making my mouth water. Eating there again is incentive enough to go back to Vegas more often!
We were about to go to some "old time" "rat pack" style steak house near downtown that people were recommending... but a nagging voice told me this would be a huge mistake... and I didn't want to make a mistake...I wanted to eat a really great steak. You see how I just got smart with words? Just there? Get it? Mistake / Steak? You see, it seems that once you have been to the mountain top, its hard to go slum it in rougher strung out pawn shop parts of the valley, so I made a last minute and very decisive decision as my executive brain is wired to do... we are going to Craftsteak... nothing less will suffice. Just because one is in Vegas... one need not roll the dice when it comes to dinner. Am I right? Or am I right? Your so right Mr. Papageorgio. . . Anyway, while I have been to the location in LA, I had not yet been to the one in Vegas, and my foodie instincts told me that it would be just as good. And not surprisingly, I was right.. . Now, just to get it out of the way, I will quickly cover the negatives:. . 1) As compared to the exceptional service interactions we had with virtually every single person we came across working in Vegas on the trip, the hostess the night we went, I believe Sunday May 18, 2014, was leaning toward the rude / I'm totally over doing this job / I'm tired of being nice to people who think they can win me over side of things.... you get the point. . 2) While the food is great, well prepared, etc, its a bit of a departure from the type of fare one would consider to be tough to replicate at home if they had seriously good taste, access to a quality grocer, and an ability to prepare food properly... its rather, basic, I'm sure by design... and it lacks that "over the top" quality one might hope for, but in no way does it disappoint. To the contrary, it satisfies. . . That concludes the negative as I don't hold the restaurant accountable for attracting a lot of drunk DB's who eat like they are in a barn and ask for ketchup. . . Now, on to the good:. . 1) We ate at the bar which was a much more intimate experience both between myself and my dining companion, and our bartender / server. Eddie. Who by the way was a true pro... the best of the best. Eddie has been with the restaurant since it opened 11 years ago. He knows what the hell he is doing and he suffers no fools. I hope he is there when I dine there next. He made our night.. 2) They pour the stiffest drinks imaginable. Perfection.. 3) While pricey, its actually a great value considering what you get. Top quality food and service.
First, let me say it makes me sad to write this review. I have been telling everyone for years that this is my favorite restaurant in the world. Which is quite a statement.  Always eat here when in Vegas. This last trip was kinda special for me, as I brought someone who had never been to Vegas before and really wanted to show them the Vegas that a lot of people don't get to see. Having already told them that this was  all time favorite restaurant, I made reservations before I left home. Reservations were for a Tuesday at 7pm.  We arrived early and were seated immediately.  We were sat in the bar area, next to another couple. I was upset, because I was trying to make a good impression and here we are in the noisy bar. I so wanted to get up and complain, but didn't want to look stupid in front of my guest. I ordered the short ribs, which are always amazing. This time they were beyond terrible. The entire bottom layer was pure fat, which gave the rest of meat a grease flavor.  The broth like gravy they come in tasted like vinegar. I could have cried. I just bit my tongue and tried to have a good time, but I was so embarrassed. My guest had the surf and turf and loved the filet, but said the lobster was rubbery.  Couldn't wait to just leave. I spend a lot of money dining out, and a $264.00 meal for two before tip doesn't bother me at all. But my food was so bad, and the table was so bad, I would have been happier in the food court.  I am going back to Vegas in 3 months and I will go back one more time. It is hard to give up on a place that has been your favorite for so long. But I think I am done with the short ribs, they were so gross I have lost my taste for them.
Started with spinach salad w/apricots, arugula salad and buffalo mozzarella salad which had hazelnuts and pimentos.  Spinach salad was clearly market fresh spinach but didn't have enough dressing to have much of a taste.  Arugula and Mozzarella salads were good.  The mozzarella salad included hazelnuts, which were quite tasty.  The steaks were as expected, good.  The 29 hour short rib was melt in your mouth good.  The potatoes and asparagus were good but not memorable.  The service was great and so was the wine.  Ambience was very cool as well.  Your definitely paying for the name, steaks were a bit on the pricey side.  It was good but I wouldn't go back, too many other James Beard chefs in Las Vegas not to try others.
One liner....Amazing.. . As I walked through the door of this humble (for Vegas) exterior, I'm instantly struck by the full length bar wall covered exclusively in various whiskey bottles. The thought crosses my mind, "Yeah, I can totally do that for dinner." My eyes like to wonder around a place to check out the eccentricities, and I notice that  they literally have hundreds of bottles of wine stashed all around the entire room. They've won me over already.. . Their dinner rolls are light, fluffy, savory, and are topped with glazed butter and probably ground sea salt. Honestly, they remind me of my great grandmother's homemade recipe which I haven't eaten in nearly 20 years. So whiskey heaven, and a time warp to home cooking.......yep, I'm loving it.. . Medium rare grilled New York Strip comes out lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection. I'd also ordered a couple of sides consisting of au gratin potatoes and grilled, sliced carrots. I couldn't have asked for anything more. . . After working my way through the sea of food, I cannot possibly eat anymore, and they were quick to box it up for me with everything individually separated to not spoil or comingle the flavors. . . Over the top? Absolutely not. Great, high end steak restaurant? YES. I would have no hesitation going back.. . Check it out for yourself, and I'm certain you'll not be disappointed.
So I decided to give Craftsteak a second chance after my not so great first visit last year, and I'm glad I did.  When I came last year, my steak was overcooked, and that was a huge disappointment, but this time things couldn't have gone better.  I ordered the Rib Eye and it was cooked just to order, along with a side of delicious fingerling potatoes.  I also had the Garlic Soup as a starter, and it was delicious prepared and very nicely presented.  But the highlight of the meal was actually the dessert, my waitress recommended the Cinnamon Monkey Bread, and it was heavenly.  GET THE CINNAMON MONKEY BREAD, you will not regret it.
I'm a fan of Craftsteak, and this location didn't disappoint... My steak was delicious, perfectly cooked, and complemented by some awesome sides. The waitstaff were also great, and very patient with our large group.. . They have a terrific wine list here, though it's overpriced in typical Las Vegas fashion. . Recommended
We had dinner here last Saturday night for the first time, and it was fabulous. We started with he lobster bisque and it was very good, with plenty of lobster in it, I ordered the short rib, which I loved and would absolutely order again next time I visit, my friends ordered the rib-eye, they were also happy. We shared sides of risotto (our favorite), potatoes gratin, asparagus, and mushrooms...all very good, but I would have been happy with just my short ribs and risotto.. . The service was also exceptional.. . Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas.
I came here with my date and my parents, since my parents always complain about how I never buy them a nice steak dinner. Everything about this restaurant screamed elegant and nice, since the decor is awesome and everybody is fairly dressed up.. . The bread is usually the attention-grabber for nice steak houses, but their's was basically just baked hawaiian bread with salt sprinkled on top. Not impressed.. . Three of us got a steak and my mother had scallops. I didn't get to try her scallops but I tried all three steaks, the 18 oz rib-eye, the 16 oz NY strip, and the 10 oz filet. Nothing was memorable minus the rib-eye, which was good because it was fatty. The meat quality wasn't particularly reflective of the price and the flavor was almost a bit bland, even for me, who avoids salt at all costs. . . Nonetheless, the spinach and potato puree sides saved the meal and were a great complement to the meat.. . This place was nice, but it definitely isn't the best steakhouse in Vegas, I'm sure of it. I've had TASTIER (not necessarily better quality) filet at Wicked Spoon buffet (yes, I just said that).. . For the record, my mother said her scallops were amazing and my dad, who doesn't usually like scallops, kept picking at it off her plate so that must be good!
Iv been here several times it's a great place for a date. . . NEVER WOULD I EVER BRING A GUEST HERE FOR A BUSINESS DINNER. . . The main room is very quite and intimate.  . . The party room was so noisy we had ear fatigue and at the end of dinner and we all were grumpy from the noise.  . . Plus we couldn't hear each other talk. . . Of course the food was good.  But the worst service I have seen on a long time. . . Maybe I'll try and eat there again in 5 years after I have forgotten about the 1200 dollar dinner I hosted where we were punished.  . . This was at the Vegas location.  . . Thanks for nothing craft steak by the way yes I did complain and no they did not care. . . Give me a break I buy dinners for a living and these guys suck.
I have done the craftsteak experience, I have had it where it is above reproach.   Tonight was not one of those nights...  I have been here when it is spot on.  Tonight was bad, sent back twice bad.   This should never happen.  To be fair, Blue, took excellent care of us as did Marvin.  But the kitchen fucked them this day...  Too bad, I love this spot, but you will have to earn my respect again.
Its been 5 days since I had dinner for business at the Craft and im still pissed.  Never bribng a large party to the Craft... Never.  they were horrible.
The focus: fresh, seasonal menu items that highlight bright and natural notes. I personally enjoyed the heirloom tomatoes, sweet corn and chefs menu beef selection. A bit on the pricey side but definitely a great treat while in Vegas. Sometimes you just have to splurge!
after spending hours reading all the reviews on Yelp of all the different steak restaurants in Vegas, we decided on CRAFTSTEAK for our 10 year anniversary dinner.. . i want to rate this restaurant 3/5 stars because of the issue with my husbands $106.00 steak, but the service we received from the restaurant manager, Jim, made up for it and earned an extra star.   . . SERVICE:. let me start off by saying the service here is EXCELLENT. end of story.. . AMBIENCE:. not too loud, not too bright, spacious, plenty of room on the table for all the food you're going to order.. . WINE: . this restaurant's wine list is PRICEY!  the least expensive bottle of red cab is $118.00.  we opted for a half bottle of Peju from Napa Valley for $55.00 and it was excellent.  normally we'd have ordered a full bottle to celebrate our anniversary but we were poolside all day and had already consumed a lot of alcohol so we didn't want to drink too much more.. . FOOD:. the complimentary mini pan of BREAD is AWESOME!.  it's served in a very hot cast iron baking tray and it stays warm the entire time.  the butter they serve with it is not rock hard so it's easy to spread on the soft warm bread.  this bread is "melt in your mouth bread"....mmmmm. . . starters: LOBSTER BISQUE and TOMATO SOUP were outstanding, so much flavor although they could have been served a bit hotter in temperature.  I had planned on ordering the Butternut Squash soup but it was not on the menu last night. . . mains: SALMON and Domestic Wagyu 14oz RIBEYE.  my salmon was excellent and cooked perfectly.  our server told me it's normally cooked med-rare and asked how i'd like it cooked so i said medium.  my husbands $106.00 ribeye is a different story :(  although it's served in a cast iron skillet and was cooked perfectly (med-rare), his steak was room temperature.  not warm enough to even eat.  he sent it back.  our server apologized and said she'd take care of it and would let her manager know.  in less than 5 minutes she returned back to our table with the "warmed up" $106.00 steak.  my husband said it was warmer but i could tell he was just "settling".  the manager Jim came over to our table and asked my husband how his steak was so he told him the truth, that he was not happy with his steak.  Jim was sympathetic and offered us free desserts/coffees/cappuccino's and said he'd adjust the price of the steak on our bill.  we were happy with that. . . sides: POTATO PUREE and CORN.  if you love garlic, tell the server to add the cloves of roasted garlic on top of the potatoes.  these potatoes are SINFUL.  the best potatoes we ever tasted.  i don't know what kind of corn we had, it was roasted in brown butter (it's not shown on the online menu).  it was very good as well.. . dessert: compliments of the manager, we chose the monkey bread on his recommendation.  we were so full at this point that we could not really enjoy it.  had only a few bites. it was very fresh, warm, DELICIOUS!  topped w/nuts and served with a side of ice cream.. . CONCLUSION: we would definitely go back.  our bill for the ribeye was adjusted to 50% off.
Food was perfect! From the salad to dessert, I wouldn't change a thing.  The filet was fork-cutting tender.  I loved the corn with chives and potato puree.  Service matched the food.  Very attentive and friendly.  Two thumbs up!!
