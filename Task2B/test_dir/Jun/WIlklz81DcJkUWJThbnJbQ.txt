CLEAN . STYLISH. SPACIOUS. . The suite is totally worth it. The bed is phenomenal and they even offer a second mini fridge that is empty so you can store your own food :-) I LOVED THIS PLACE
I hated it here! First impression 3 men at the valet stand laughing and talking while I take my bags out of my car. No one offered to help  because they are obviously too busy talking. The room was nice and big. The check in agent was nice and helpful. Once in the room we called for towels and sheets for the pull out couch, housekeeping took over 45 mins. This is unaccpetable. 4 Stars really? Are we giving this to anyone? There was dust on everything tables, couch, chairs, and window sill. Even worse were the mystery stains on the couch talk about disgusting, mystery white stains!!! How unsanitary Clearly they need to up their cleaning skills and require some sort of checklist when clean the guest rooms. I would never stay at this hotel again. Not worth the price or the wait.
The Vdara Is one of my favorite hotels when I visit Vegas. They are a Non-smoking Non-Gaming property owned by the MGM Group and I prefer to this hotel for a couple reasons. While most people go to Vegas to go crazy and unleash, I prefer to unwind and the Vdara is comfortable and allows its guests to go out for fun or have a good time but come back to a calm and peaceful enviroment to rest. The rooms here are beautiful and offer great rates in comparison to other Vegas hotels rates'. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious and the property is quiet. You don't have to worry about being woken up all night long by loud music or deal with drunk people passed outside the door to your room because this hotel, while not the most expensive, Is simply classy and they offer great amenities, and services. This property offers awesome customer service, a great location, and modern touches which are overlooked or simply outdated at many of the older properties.
Good location with some poor housekeeping and service.   . . Going back in 2013 the stocked toiletries were haphazard, randomly all shampoo and a shower gel, when I called down to fix it it took a while and they gave a jumbled amount of everything like they couldn't bother to give one of each?  I would understand if it were busy, but passing by an open room door with a maid cart parked in front of it you could see four maids sitting around chatting away.  Worried about things being clean after that and looking closer furnishings were dusty.  The furniture has not been well maintained and it's definitely not nice and shiny like when I went in 2010.. . I booked the room cheap and that's the only reason it's not 1 star.
If I could give VDARA a 6 star I would. I booked the city corner suite for my birthday and it was amazing!!!!  It was clean , fancy, great view. It is worth it I loved it. We even checked out their pool and it was nice also.  This will definitely be my nice place to stay at. :) And also their service is great.
The three star ranking is going to be for this most recent visit only, because my first visit was a five star experience.. Checked in at 2am because It's our 3 year anniversary and we just finished having a great time gambling, feasting and watching Penn & Teller that night before coming in.. We check in and have to wait 45 minutes (3am now).  The room wasn't quite ready yet. We head out the next day around 2...hit the "room service" required button. We come back that evening and all our dirty dishes are still out from breakfast room service and no housekeeping  was done that day.  Hence the 3 star.  Two routine expectations that went unmet at a luxury hotel in Las Vegas.. . What saved the ranking from being lower was the fabulous staff, courteous manager and bell woman.  They also gave me a $100 food and beverage credit and 3pm late checkout.  So overall, great service and staff.  Just need to work out the kinks systematically to ensure a smooth check in process and create a good first impression.  I would give it one more chance because it is a lovely hotel and great value for the price.
My boyfriend made the arrangements to stay at this "5-star Hotel."  I'm thinking, cool, five stars, I don't have to worry about a thing! I'm a terrible packer so this sounded good to me.  Hmm, not the case. . We arrived mid-day, no problems, no worries. We stopped by the local Food 4 Less for provisions - champagne and the like. It was his birthday and they were nice enough to upgrade us to a beautiful suite over looking the Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan pool.  Sweet view of the Bellagio fountain show! The suite itself is awesome.  It was like a modern studio apartment.  . So on to this 5 star ridiculousness.  The kitchen area was great, stove, fridge, table .. but no wares.  Not a single cup in the whole place. Not even in the bathroom was there a rinse cup.  5 stars, I'm expecting a robe, right? Not so much.  Apparently, you have to call down for services.  Okay.  I've stayed at full service places before and I get it, you bring me silverware and ice when I need it.  This place, we called for robes, we called for glassware, we called for dishes, but we had to get our own ice :)  We got our own ice and waited for nearly 20 minutes for our glassware to come up.  I'm real thirsty at this point.. The bathroom looked good.  The large soaking tub was great.  I prefer my bathroom to have a fan or something, but this one only had a light.  Weird.  The amenities were awful.  5 stars and all we get are Q tips and a facial pad? huh? The shampoo, conditioner and lotion were in square bottles which made it nearly impossible to get out - which you might think is being picky, but my shower experience was so frustrating. It was like trying to get ketchup out of a Heinz bottle in the shower. No bueno. . Large beautiful windows - great night lights and the early morning was also beautiful but too bad I couldn't enjoy my coffee while I got ready in the morning because there was no coffee pot!  On the same card as the price display for the mini bar, there's a coffee service item for $15.  The boyfriend doesn't drink coffee and I wasn't going to pay $15 for a cup of coffee that probably would have taken 20 minutes to get to me. I guess I could have gone downstairs to the Starbucks, but that kinda ruins the whole relaxing-in-my-room-before-I-step-out-into-the-world morning routine. . Other than a complete miss on my 5-star expectations, it was a nice hotel.  It's a spa hotel and it smelled like a spa, which is super nice in Vegas since most every other hotel smells like ashes.  Its location is a bit bizarre.  Because it's kind of towards the back of the Aria circle, it took us nearly 20 minutes to get out of the hotel, on the tram, and onto the strip! . I felt like maybe because I didn't know what I was getting into, I wasn't prepared, my experience was so-so.  And this 5 star business ... even the Motel 6 gives you free in-room coffee!  It's the little things that make it a 5 star, right? The service and the amenities.  Vdara wants to be 5 star but really, she's 4 star at best. . My advice: Stay here and be prepared.  Call ahead with requests for wares and robes and everything else they are willing to do for you.
From service, to the amazing people ! This is a great hotel ! Totally recommend this hotel ! No casino which was the best part ! I don't gamble & it's so clean as well
The view from the corner suite with the fountain view is amazing. The hotel is a refreshing retreat from the smoke filled casino madness. Also it is ideally located in the middle of the Strip next to spots that you will want to go.
This hotel is located a bit off the strip and is connected to Aria. If you don't mind walking I would definitely recommend this hotel. I believe it is the only hotel without a casino so it is not noisy at night time and there are no randoms strolling through the halls. They actually have a staff member  standing by the elevators, that ask you to flash you key before entering. I know you are thinking sounds a bit uptight for Vegas but quite the contrary. We blasted our music every night while we got dressed and never received a noise complaint.  Everything is beautifully decorated. We reserved a suite for the weekend which came with a mini fridge, counter space, stove top and cupboards. It was all modern and the room was very spacious. The customer service was great, I forgot my room number and I also checked in later than my friends and they were so accommodating. We checked in late because our flights were delayed and they said if we came back in the morning we could switch our room to one with a better view (our room was beautiful so we were fine without it). Overall, I would definitely stay here again. The only thing this hotel is missing is something that stands out. There is a cafe downstairs and a bar but no real sit down restaurants. Most of the hotels have buffets and attractions and sadly this one did not. Because Ari is a hop skip and a jump away we went there at night to eat and gamble after the club.
I love staying at Vdara! The atmosphere of this hotel definitely feels like a moderncontemporary retreat. All the employees are very friendly, accommodating, and resourceful. We usually come to Vegas during the week and it's great, less crowds and complimentary upgrades! We spent this week at the penthouse suite on the 55th floor and the view was amazing! The rooms were kept clean and housekeeping did a swell job on maintenance and turn down service. . On this stay we ordered room service for dinner and it was fabulous! Our server set up our dining table in the room as if we were at a restaurant, he even brought up a small vase with flowers, it was so special. The food was amazing and worth every penny! Shrimp cocktail with huge, and I mean huge, fresh prawns was the appetizer. For entrees I ordered the Short Ribs Pappardelle and the boyfriend ordered Grilled Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes and baby vegetables. Everything came out perfect, my pasta was fresh made and his steak was flavorful and tender. . I love visiting the lobby bar here at Vdara. Their cocktails are tasty and they always have new items on their drink and good menu. . This hotel has so much to offer you don't even notice there isn't a casino, which isn't a problem at all because Aria is so close. The calming music and sweet perfume of the hotel actually makes me feel like I am on a relaxing vacation, and acts as a great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the on goings of the strip. I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel. I went to Vegas for the first time a few weeks ago and stayed at Vdara. I really enjoyed the 'clean' atmosphere. There was no cigarette smoke to choke me and I didn't have to listen to the annoying sounds of a casino. This hotel is clean, modern, and welcoming. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Vegas!!
I love the vdara!. . My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday and checked in around 9:30pm. We were on the 34th floor with an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains! The room itself was wonderful. There was a small kitchenette with a sink, microwave, stove top burner, mini bar and mini fridge (complete with 2 complimentary waters) The room was very spacious with a table for dining and a couch to kick back on. The bathroom had a HUGE soak tub! I mean you could have a party in that thing. There was also a seperate shower. The bed was also very comfy! Oh and the front desk staff was very kind and accomodating. . . Now the reason i took off a star.. POOR HOUSEKEEPING!!! First, we called housekeeping for robes and ended up waiting around an hour before leaving the room. Thankfully they were there when we returned. Second, i found trash in the kitchenette area that hadn't been cleaned by housekeeping from a previous guest. GROSS!! Third, they THREW AWAY our shuttle passes! WTH?! Now we have to pay a taxi nearly $20 because of their dumbass mistake. I was very upset about that. and Lastly, (nothing to do with housekeeping).. there was a dog on our floor that kept barking and barking and barking some more. We booked this hotel because there was no casino and in hopes it would be more quiet and relaxing. No, little red Rover did not let me sleep. Thats okay i only had the worlds worst hangover no problem.. . All in all I would probably book this hotel again.
I love this place! My boyfriend treated me to a "staycation" for my birthday and surprised me with this. The entire time we were there, from the time we checked in to the time we checkout out, was amazing! Our room was beautiful and the view from the 33rd floor was awesome as well. The entire staff impressed me with how hospitable they all were, especially the bartenders and the bell boys. The only complaint I would have is the room next to us a barking dog but we mentioned it to one of the staff and it stopped. I would come back here in an instant!
We stayed here for the first time last week. Been wanting to stay here since it opened. Well....we finally did. The Vdara is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at in Vegas. We were very impressed. Super clean, very nice, convenient and classy. All the employees we interacted with treated us with nothing but respect. We will definitely be coming back.
Well I just got back today from staying at vdara and I loved the room. I got a great email deal so it was a decent price but wow let me tell you its an amazing experience.  The bed was the best so soft and comfortable. Pillows were just right need to find out what kind they are to buy some. Bathroom was great loved the fact the bathtub was big and we could completely fit inside. Water was nice and soft which is a plus. I appreciated the fact we had a microwave but here was the cons.. . Cons: mini fridge was broken we called an hour into being there they sent someone out however she said she couldnt fix it. She offered for us to use the paid mini fridge side but it still didn't get very cold and it constantly got stuck. They were suppose to send someone the next day it never happened. It was disappointing that they didn't send a person I expected more since it's more upscale than other hotels. The blackout shades are not really blackout shaded they need to modify it so its just 1 long one because short individual still let plenty of light in and Im a light sleeper and it woke me up early.
the rooms are sooo comfortable. The staff is very pleasant and helpful.. Anything I needed everyone was more than helpful. Food was good from the hotel and the hotel bar made tasty drinks. I love the tub (relaxing) I love the blackout shades, the kitchen and dining area in my room. I have intentions of returning soon.
Very happy with our stay here.  We wanted a place on the Strip, but without having to drag the kids through a smoky casino to get to the elevators.  They have none of that here, opting to be a straight hotel.  Their companion hotel, The Aria, has that a very short walk away.. . The hotel feels very modern and brand-new.  The room was exceptional.  We got a suite, so we could have a few nights away from the kids.  The kitchenette allowed us to store a few things, and feel right at home.  The bed put us to sleep in just minutes.. . My only complaint is the price of the drinks there.  $15 for a bloody mary?  And just Sky vodka.  I've been to Vegas a number of times, so I'm surprised when I get sticker-shocked by something.  Take your drinking elsewhere, or just bring something to your room before hitting the pool.
I got to stay here for free (Well, paid in points at least lol) It's $97 for one of their "deluxe" suites at the time, the view was incredible, so clean too, easily the cleanest hotel room I've ever been in, all the furniture and sheets smelled brand new, the staff was incredible, it was on my birthday, they gave me a free champagne bottle, the little juice bar/cafe downstairs was convenient the next morning after a long night of drinking, the interior design is very modern, we saw a lot of Europeans there, very classy crowds, no noise, nobody screaming or drunk in the hallway, just perfect! Would stay here again and again. Would give it 6 stars if I could, knowing that it is partially owned by Dubai World also made it that much better lol, GO HERE!!
They weren't kidding when they said do Vegas differently. I was a little unsure about the whole no casino thing and not directly on the strip thing, but since I flew in to Vegas for EDC, I knew I wasn't going to be spending much time in my room anyway since my friends and I were a bit ambitious with the pool parties, clubs, and actual event at the speedway. It was SO NICE to have a relaxing setting without all the cigarette smoke you would find in your usual casino resort. It's not too far off the strip and you can always take the tram to aria/crystals/Monte Carlo. . . The breakfast is pretty delicious for room service food. The dinner menu ok. It looks kind of unappetizing but it tastes all right if you're too lazy to go out or have some comps available. . . You can charge everything to your room which is cool. . . Housekeeping is awesome. They reorganized our messy stuff on the tables/bathroom (in a good way) and clean the shower each day for you so it's like your in a newroom each time you come back. The staff are super nice too. Hands down the best experience I've had in a Vegas hotel. I realized how bad my MGM experience was last year while on this stay lol.
Great hotel!!! Just stayed here this past weekend and I was well pleased with everything there. Service was great, rooms was clean and comfortable. Very quite and non smoking casino. I would stay here again!
So there were a lot of great things about this hotel but also a lot of little things that bugged me.. . Pros:. -Beautiful hotel/rooms. -We received a free upgrade with a fountain view. -Room service food was yummy. -Friendly/helpful staff. -No smoking in the hotel. . Cons:. -The shades don's block out all the light. -Can't charge things to your room/must pay over phone. -Couldn't buy movies. Had to call and pay with card. -Mini bar menu was there but fridge was empty and locked. -Towels took an hour to come up. . The hotel was so nice and modern I really did enjoy it and probably would stay here again. The little things I mentioned were just annoying and things I haven't ever had issues with at other hotels. If I'm ordering food I don't want to give you my credit card info and pay then.. I'm on vacation.. I want to take care of that at the end. Also, when you party all night and want to sleep all day it's nice to have a dark room.. these rooms have tons of light even with the "blackout shades" closed.. . More like 3.5 stars.
I booked the hotel without knowing it is a hotel ONLY, no casino. Then I realize it is quite nice without all the noise and crowd rushing left and right. It is a no smoking hotel which is really great and help keep my lung clean!
The sitch: Going to Vegas for the first time with boyfriend and his friends who go yearly (if not twice yearly). For rewards reasons, boyfriend prefers MGM properties.. . After we spent a few days deliberating where to stay, we decided Vdara was the best in terms of price for what you get. . . We originally booked a city corner suite, but a few weeks prior to check-in we were invited to upgrade to the executive city corner suite. 1 1/2 baths, dining space for 4 people, full kitchen, living room and bedroom.  Ridiculous for two people? Yes. But isn't Vegas the place for that kind of ridiculousness? . . The rooms are all about being seamless: almost everything is controlled by pushing a button or flipping a switch on pad of switches per room. Whether it's just turning on the lights, drawing the blinds or changing the temperature.. . I also really love that Vdara isn't a casino hotel.  It feels so refreshing to walk through the entrance and not feel like I'm upping my chances of lung cancer by the minute.   I think that is one of the reasons it's a great hotel for anything spa-related.  It's just clean. comfortable. nice. . . The only thing I wish it had was a more "complete" restaurant or bar.  Both the small cafe and the bar make you feel a little on display by everyone lingering in/walking through. However, Aria is just a few steps away and have all the amenities of the bigger casino hotels. . . I'd recommend anyone taking a trip to LV to consider Vdara!
Nice rooms and good staff, however at the end of the stay they tried to charge is a "resort fee". It's for the "complimentary" wifi and water. If you complain long enough they'll waive it, but it's complete horseshit.
Vdara Hotel was my choice hotel until I tried checking in today.  Was told my room was not ready and would have to wait 2 hours. I checked my luggage in to hold and went off to kill time.  Three hours later.. My corner suite is still not ready.  The hotel lets customers know by the hour.. So despite my room may be ready at 4:10... I have to wait until 5:00 to be informed that it's ready. Not good! I will be late to my event.. But rest assuredly when 10 of my friends return to Vegas in sept it will NOT be the Vdara that we stay. I'm so disappointed.
This is a beautiful, modern hotel with nice rooms, but it is not for me. Too far to walk to anywhere good and I miss having a casino right there. Aria and bellagio are nearby, but neither of these are great places to gamble if you are a low roller like me.. . A couple of positive notes: the beds are great, the tub is nice (but is smaller than it looks and fills up fast), the little fridge and kitchen area are nice and the elevators are fast. We are on the 50th floor and have a great view, but can hear the freeway pretty loudly. Also the blackout curtains are pretty useless. The toiletries are ok, kinda generic looking, but according to the literature placed in the bathroom, they are "specially formulated". They work ok and smell vaguely of baby shampoo.. . Anyway, if you are on a business trip and hate Vegas (i.e., not me at all), this is probably a great choice for a hotel.   I probably wouldn't stay here again personally unless the price was amazing here and terrible everywhere else.
