Great experience. I've been to Vegas several times and staying at the Flamingo exceeded my expectations. Right in the middle of everything.. . Clean, and the staff was very friendly. All the rooms, but the suites have been updated. . . Do not be discouraged by the other reviews. Stayed here for a great deal and my family visiting from Central America really enjoyed it.
Love the remodeled rooms - pink, white, chocolate colors - with fun wall paper, hot pink walls, big shower, very comfy beds - all I kept thinking was "this would be great for a bachelorette party!"  Very centrally located on the strip.  Staff was very nice, smiles and hellos everywhere.  Pool was okay - not as much of a scene as some other vegas hotels, but i like that.
Eh, you get what you pay for here at The Flamingo. Stayed here in mid May 2014. It's one of the cheaper options on The Strip and it shows. Sure the rooms are renovated but the lobby and hallways leave a lot to be desired. And although the room was renovated, it still looked like it could use a lot of work! The lamp shade was dented, there was nail polish stains on the bedside table and the bathroom was just disgusting. Needed a new paint job and a serious deep cleaning to get the dust off the vents. Ew. . . We had two rooms and requested to get them adjoining. They were unable to do this and would not even upgrade us to a suite so we all could be together. Also, out of the 3 days we were there the maids only touched our room once. Our one rooms air conditioning did not work either. In Vegas, that's a serious problem. Unfortunately, customer service isn't a huge priority for the staff. . . The thing that got me the most however was that there is ZERO cell phone reception in your room. Not even your LTE or whatever you have on your phone. None of it works. They tell you if you pay for the wifi it'll be reimbursed after you check out. Uhhh didn't want to fight that battle later so didn't bother with that. . . My recommendation: you're in Vegas. Splurge for a nice room at the MGM! . . The only redeeming thing about The Flamingo is the great pool! But that's not enough to make me ever want to stay there again.
The Flamingo is sinking fast!. . I've had several great stays here in years past but the hotel needs a lot of work! Most elevators don't even work and the ones that do stop at almost every floor for no reason. the hallways in standard rooms section are in very poor shape.. . The standard rooms lack any sort of ambience and the bathrooms are old and dingy. The upgraded rooms are obviously better but the hotel has a 3.5 star rating at booking sites which is grossly misrepresented. They offered an upgraded room for $20 at check in but felt a 3.5* room should be sufficient. Boy, we we wrong! If you have to stay here, go with an upgraded room unless you have very low Vegas standards. $22 resort fee and wifi doesn't even work!. . To top off our stay, a cockroach bit my wife while outside by Carlos and Charlies. I realize it was outside but she wasn't happy none the less!. . I'd stay away at all costs!
The hallways were gross (don't go barefoot) and the room was soooo far from the elevator, but other than that we were very happy. Comfy and clean room. Very well worth the $40 a night to be in the middle of the strip. The POOL is the best part, no kids allowed! They'll even bring you a disposable ash tray pool-side ;)
Stayed here with a group of girlfriends. We booked our rooms as a package deal with the flights via Expedia. We called them months in advance to make sure that our two rooms were adjoining. We called the hotel on the day of check in to confirm our reservations and they told us that we didn't have any! After a 2 minute mini-heart attack and a transfer to someone else our reservation was found. We also confirmed again that our rooms would be adjoining. Flash-forward. We get to Vegas and check in. Our rooms were not adjoining. The closest that we could get was across the hall from each other, which worked out okay for us. . . The hall carpet desperately needed replaced. It was bunched up in the hallways and was not easy to walk on with heels. The hotel room itself was okay. The TV was turned on once and we could not get it turned off. We tried using the remote and the power button and that sucker was on for good....We had to unplug the TV to eventually get it off. The only other complaint would be the toilet seat. At first we thought it was dirty but turns out it was just yellow stains... ALL over the seat. It was kind of gross. . . The location of the hotel is amazing and the 21 and over pool was perfect for a day of lounging and partying. I would defiantly stay there again on my next trip to Vegas.
A good middle-of-the-road Vegas hotel. Rooms are nice, the location is perfect - right in the middle of the Strip so you not only save on the room, but you save on cabs because you can walk to any club. Most rooms have been renovated. And they have a really nice pool that has music and drinks and lounge chairs and also lets in the public - way less crowded and more fun than a beach club in my opinion.
Tried playing Roulette here.  Gave my ID along with my girlfriend's ID so she can sit at the table.  Gave my Total Rewards card along with the amount I wanted to play with.. . The dealer just seemed rude and didn't want to be there.  Gave our cards back in a way that just rubbed me the wrong way.  He then said only one of us, either my girlfriend or myself, can play with the chips.  Okay, I understand and accept that.  First time that's happened, but whatever.  It'll avoid any confusion and disputes even though it is our money.  But the way he asked us who would be playing was just rude and arrogant.. . After a couple of hands, the dealer was just giving off a bad vibe.  Cashed out, got my cash equivalent and just left the place to go elsewhere.
THERE. WAS. A. USED. CONDOM. IN. OUR. ROOM. . . DISGUSTING.  Unfortunately, my bf and I didn't discover the used condom on the floor behind the door until the 2nd day.  When I first walked in after checking in, I looked around and saw a bobby pin on the bathroom sink, makeup streaks on the mirror, and white stains on their chair/lounger thing.  I decided to ignore them since the hotel was cheap and we only wanted it for a home base.  But after seeing the used condom, we freaked out and immediately went to the concierge to let them know.. . Concierge: We let them know, they apologized and said they'd take care of it.  We asked if we could change rooms, they said to talk to front desk.  . . There are a bajillion people standing in line waiting to check in so we waited in the keys/mail line for 30+ minutes as the next in line.. . Front Desk: apologized, changed rooms, and offered us a $50 food/drink credit at their approved locations.  Really? Not to be greedy or anything but that's it? You were negligent enough to let me sleep a night in the presence of someone else's bodily fluids and that's it?? By booking on Yelp, I get $20 in food and drinks!. . Back to old room to get our stuff: condom still there, by now it's been 45 min since we've told someone. Don't you think that this is something you send someone up to take care of IMMEDIATELY?  What if we couldn't get our room switched, we would have to put up w/ this disgusting thing for longer? I sure as **** won't touch it.. . Other things wrong with this place:  . . Hair drier didn't work, half the outlets didn't work, phone couldn't call front desk, elevators didn't work half the time, hotel hallways had empty bottles of gatorade, trash.. . Construction on the floor blocking off our route to our room, we had to take the elevator to the 7th floor w/ our luggage, walk all the way to another elevator, come down the stairs with luggage to get to our room...  . . Our new room had a wonderful view of a roof. Whatever, don't care... until I woke up one morning, opened the blinds and find a bunch of dudes staring back at me because they're working on the roof.  I wasn't dressed for the day yet. Ugh.. . Food: we used our credit on their buffet, so not worth it and they almost weren't going to honor it because we had checked out literally 10 min ago until my bf was so pissed he just yelled BULLSH*T.  "How are we going to charge you if you checked out already?" Um you don't, $50 is more than enough to cover your crappy brunch buffet.. . TLDR: Sure, 2nd room was cleaner, and location of the Flamingo is convenient.  but don't gamble on the cleaniness of this place, go elsewhere.
Had my baby sisters wedding here @ the Garden Chapel. First off let me say Why the heck is it so hard to find the parking!?! No sign saying Flamingo Parking or Park Here. Geezus! So after two U turns and a "I think it's this way honey" we turned in and were glad to find that we had made the right decision. After we drove through the most confusing self parking garage and actually ended up going the wrong way at one point, we ended up just parking and walking down a level to the elevators. These have to be some of the oldest elevators that exist in Las Vegas. And for me that is not a good thing. Due to this one moment in my life where I was stuck in an elevator - a story for another time. So once we get down and find our way to the casino we start searching for the garden chapel. Not many signs directing the way. If I wouldn't have been staring off into space out of the doors leading outside we would have missed it. We headed outside and looked rather out of place walking past the tourists in swimsuits. We continued on the beaten path and had to continue to follow signs around the outside area. We finally headed up to a little building that looked like it could possibly be the chapel.. . We headed in and were greeted by our family members. My sister was in the brides quarters doing final touches. Not a bad sized room with plenty of mirrors. Total with the bride there were 7 of us and there was still a bit of room left over. We headed out to wait for the ceremony to begin. We were told by the minister NOT to take photos or video...ARE YOU SERIOUS! Yah I get they want you to buy the photos they take and the video they record, but honestly let me get a couple snaps in because I like raw photos. Anyway, the ceremony began and it was beautiful. I was bawling like a baby the whole time. Nothing over the top, but more simple and elegant. We were told to remain seated after the ceremony while they exited and signed papers and then they were to return and do complete photos with family. We all took turns getting our pictures taken with bride and groom and then we were to exit while they finished photos together. The brides stuff was taken out of the room and stored in the employee room as they had another bride scheduled immediately after. We actually saw the next bride walking up as we were exiting. As you exit the chapel and turn right down a couple steps there is a pretty waterfall. We decided to take our own photos in front of it while waiting. It did have a bit of a smell, maybe due to the birds and things. . . After the bride and groom exited we made them take photos in front of the waterfall and then we headed out to the reception. You can exit down the chapel steps and follow the pool around to the valet which you can also access the self parking garage. (wish I would have known that before walking in a big circle through the casino) The whole place seemed pretty dirty and smelly. Would not be my suggestion for a first time tourist. The elevator felt sketchy as we were going back up to level 6. It was shaky and stuttering and there was an actual hole cut in the ceiling that you could watch the elevator going up. Yah I may have had a slight panic attack and practically jumped off the elevator as it came to our stop.. . I am not sure if I will frequent the Flamingo or even go back unless there was something enticing. As far as the room reviews I have read, I don't think I'd have a staycation either. It's a staple of Las Vegas, just needs some cleaning and a bit updating.
Not happy this year, bad customer service, bed bugs, not willing to refund for my inconvenience. The 2 stars r only for the Go Room, its sheek. Management does not care. Must wait 5 days for someone to call regarding refund. Bunch of bs.
Worst hotel. Just checking in was a horrific experience. Over half an hour to tell us they don't have a room ready even though we paid for it
Just got back from a 5 night stay. Don't go here, stay at Motel 6 its better. My stay started off as two reservations. I had a reservation for Sunday, then another one for Monday. When I checked in the clerk assured me that I would not have to check out and re-check back in on Monday. After I return from my all days meeting I found I could not get into my room. There are no telephones in the hallway to call so I had to go all the way back down to handle. The manager was very rude (Ryan) and told me that my room is being taken out of the system for work. I asked him for a higher room, I was on the 12th floor he proceeded to move me to the 10th floor. As I enter the room I was hit with cigarette smoke and was not able to stay there. I called down to Ryan and ask for another room and ask again for a high floor. He said no problem and that he would send a bellman up with the key. I was put on the 5th floor. I did not have cash on me so I asked the bellman for his name and told him I would find him tomorrow. He was very upset about this, flip his hand at me and walked out the door while I was still talking to him. No need to worry about that tip. This is not a clean or friendly hotel. The carpet was dirty and/or stained. It really made me sick to look at it. My newly remodeled room had broken tile in bath, dried food on the furniture and the soft pillows were hard as a rock. If you think you are going to need cash bring it with you. The ATM charge a $5.99 fee. The food is not bad but $20 for a hamburger...not worth it. Not until the end of my stay did I find out about the $55 buffet that is good for 24 hours and you can eat at 4-5 different hotels. You can eat as much as you want as often as you want. This hotel needs major renovation and the staff needs customer service training. Take your money someplace else.
Goodness, this place is a mess. Booked a GO room for a weekend and was very disappointed with the overall experience of the resort. First off, if you have to stay here, book through  Chase Ultimate Rewards - lower rates,  no resort fee ($20 a night savings) and they give you a $9 per person continental breakfast credit for Club Cappuccino. The rate was good, and the location is hard to beat. The GO room product itself is pretty nice - newly renovated, some new tech (motorized blinds, tv in the bathroom, sound system). Our room, however, was pretty worn out - scuffs on furniture, broken furniture pieces, etc. Housekeeping was also inconsistent - our first day, they didn't clean our room, but provided us with the extra toiletries we requested. . . The Flamingo's parking garage is a nightmare - very confusing layout, slow, and trashed elevators. **Tip** The hotel/casino connection is on the 3rd floor. Arrived for check in around 11:30 pm and the line was pretty long... it took us over 40 min just to check in. Wear and tear is evident throughout the hotel. I know the Flamingo is one of the Strip's older hotels, but just b/c something is old, doesn't mean it has to be busted up - broken elevators, dented buttons and furniture, clogged plumbing. The pool area is a redeeming quality - we checked out the GO pool, which is the 21+ pool area - nice chill place. Overall, I would recommend spending a little more to stay at Monte Carlo, NYNY, or Luxor.
I Loved My Stay At THE Flamingo . We we're  close to everything the rooms were upgraded which was nice..  Love the tv in the bathroom . I also loved the pool it was awesome . We had a blast at the flamingo . Loved the restaurants and the staff was nice.
Quite possibly the worst hotel we have ever stayed in!! Absolutely filthy! The hallways smelled, half the elevators didn't work and it took us half an hour in line just to pick up our key AFTER we registered! Never again!!!
I don't write that many reviews for places but I just had to for this one in particular. I didn't really have a good experience with this hotel (after not traveling to Las Vegas for almost 8 years) and coming back to see a hotel that didn't meet my expectations was terrible. . . This is primarily because of 3 things, customer service issue, key for the hotel room, and unwashed bed sheets and covers. What can I say about the customer service issue? One of the ladies who was in charge of hotel admission did not help at all with a simple room key problem. I rented the hotel room with a couple of friends and my name was not registered within the hotel room. The lady told me she couldn't do anything about fixing the hotel room key because my name was not listed for the room and she said "I'm sorry." I wasn't with my friends at this time because they were out having some fun in the casinos. Basically I was stuck in my hotel and I wasn't planning to wait hours for them to come back. I went back to the floor where my room was and then back downstairs again at the hotel admission but this time a different lady helped me out and she was able to let me get back in my room. . . The key for the hotel room was a disaster and such a hassle. The keys that were given to my friends and I kept malfunctioning and we'd have to go back upstairs and downstairs constantly in order to fix it. . . Lastly, the bed sheet covers and the pillow covers were not washed. They smelled really bad like someone's sweat was on the covers.
The elevators don't work....which result in guests swarming the few that do (I waited in a mob of people for almost 15 minutes to catch an elevator!); you hear bass from outside parties that keep you up at night; crappy rooms with beds that have worn out mattresses;  all for the lovely deal of over $300 a night. There are so many other options in Vegas.... the Flamingo is NOT one of them.  As I write this, it is 12:55am, and I'm on a mattress that is slumping to one side while a pool party is raging outside my window (and I'm on the 24th floor and STILL can hear it)....the sound insullation of these rooms is terrible! Spend your money elsewhere!
Affordable, great location and the rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. The check in/out staff is fantastic and friendly. However, wish I could say the same for the bell staff who were the exact opposite. I was there for a conference and canattest that the food service was some of the best I've had. I would have been happy with just the individual apple crumb pie alone. I would say the only big negative is the elevators. Be prepared to stop at floors 10 and 11 whether or not someone is getting on/off (ghosts of Frank and Dean?) and the less frequent resetting of selected floors.
Stayed at the Flamingo for 4 days for a bachelorette party. I was pleased to see how large the room was! That's about all I've got to boast for it. The shower took foreverrrrrrr to release hot water and the pillows on our bed smelled absolutely disgusting. I cuddle my pillows so the arm I wrapped around my pillow is now covered in hives. Phone connections are being rewired but we didn't know that. We tried calling the front desk from the room phone and had no luck until we called from our cell phones and told us to call the operator and they'd redirect us. At one point we had to take the stairs down the hotel because elevators were too crowded...we somehow ended up on the 4th floor roof because there were no signs on where to go once those stairs ended. Pizza from the casino is no good. I was really sick the day after and couldn't totally enjoy the activities planned because I had bubble guts all day.. . The pool party was pretty fun and although the drinks were pricy, they were strong. Maybe too strong. I'm trying to enjoy a drink, not get wasted off it. Went to the pool both Friday and Saturday. Friday was fun got in for free because we were hotel guests. There was a $20 cover charge for Saturday and it kind of sucks to have to pay a cover at your own hotel pool to listen to a "guest DJ" play music you don't like. Oh well. . . I probably won't stay in this hotel ever again.
I wanted to start off this review by thanking one of the Flamingo employees. Damon Rosa was amazing, he shined at the check in counter. His customer service is phenomenal and I really wanted to recognize him. He fixed the issue of my keys not working right after I checked in (which is ridiculous after my 1st encounter at the check-in desk), and he changed my room to something a little more suitable and satisfying. As a manager myself, I feel it's important to recognize your employees who are doing something right. Especially those with such great customer service skills and amazing hospitality. . . Now moving on to the issues at hand during my stay. When I checked in, Benjamin helped me. He stated my room was only reserved for 2 guests. I told him we had three guests and the reservationist must have got confused. He said well unfortunately we cannot do anything about that I have to charge you an extra fee each night. . . My stay was from Thursday the June 19th through Sunday the 22nd and I was with a convention. Our special booking rate included up to three guests in each  reservation. . . I explained to Benjamin I was unsatisfied with the fee, not because of the dollar amount, but because of the fact that I had told the reservationists, and I was under the impression that I had three people in my room at booking. I asked  if I could speak to his manager, and he went over to speak to another gentleman, they did not give me his name and just explained that he was new from New Orleans. Benjamin said that they can pull the conversation of the booking to see if I specifically stated I wanted three people in my room.  He also suggested I wait an hour or two while they pull the conversation before a check-in which I told him that's preposterous, why should should I have to wait after I've already been waiting in what was a long check in line?. . So we agreed I would only be charged for two people as that was my understanding of the total cost of the initial booking, and that Benjamin or whichever manager can contact me and let me know what was said during the initial booking conversation. At this point Mr. Murphy you came over and handed me your card. . . I was never contacted and at check out I saw that I was charged $30 a day for an additional pool guest, all three days of my stay. I checked out with one of the representatives with the iPad who said my bill would be emailed to me. By time I received my email, I had left Las Vegas. . . When I saw the charges I contacted the hotel and they told me to contact the billing department. Unfortunately on Sunday the billing department is closed. So I called the billing department today, which is Monday the 23rd. I explain the situation to billing representative and she stated that there was not an additional person charge, but it was additional guest at the pool charge. . . She said she could not do nothing about it because that was all done through the pool and handled by the hotel. I explained to her that we only used the pool one day during the our stay and why should I be charged every day of my stay for additional pool guest when we did not utilize those facilities?. . I asked to speak to her manager, who she said is not available, and then I asked for a corporate email address, which she said they do not offer. She transferred me to her manager's voicemail. I left a message with him and have not heard back. . . She also explained that unfortunately sometimes people are  transferred back and forth between the hotel and the billing department, because neither can solve the situation it seems. . . I feel that I have been wrongfully charged by the flamingo Hotel and the Caesars entertainment group for a fee that I did not agree to. I would like to ask that I have the $30 pool fee removed from my bill for each of the days of my stay. The whole experience I had at the hotel was horrible. From check in, to being put in a dark dingy room with a horrible view and of poor quality, To my room keys not working to access that horrible room, to the elevators not working properly and the facilities of the casino and hotel not up to par with the standards of Vegas. . . All in all, if you don't have one of the nicest hotels on the strip, at the very least, you can do is provide great customer service to your guests.  In my experience there was very poor customer service, although there were a few individuals that did provide great service (Damon Rosa at front desk, and the bellhop that helped our luggage to the room were amazing), but overall the experience was not a pleasant one.
I really like The Flamingo. I really try to just stay at Total Rewards Casino Hotels in order to accumulate points. After Caesars Palace, this is my favorite one. They have done some re-modeling to the rooms to give it a more modern feel. The buffet is also moderately priced. The number of tables available to play card games is plentiful. I also enjoy their Sportsbook in comparison to some of the other Total Rewards Hotels. The other appealing thing about this place is its location on The Strip. Staying here means that you're basically smack dab in the middle of it all and can walk in any direction to other attractions. I also love the recently designed LINQ area right next door, which offers a nice, clean, and family friendly area of shops and restaurants.
This is our second time staying here.  The last time was a few years back for a wedding held at this hotel.  We thought it was nice enough for the price and location to stay there for this recent trip.. . I would say it's a no frills kind of hotel.  The rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller.  They have done some room upgrades since our last stay (some type of synthetic hard flooring, better than carpet).  This is not important to me , but I found it rather funny that part of the room decor was upgraded (bedding, flooring) and some were not (tables/dressers/bathroom).  If you don't care about staying in a trendy hip hotel, this is your place.  It's a decent place to rest your head, located halfway down the strip.. . There is a new street (Link) located next to the Flamingo, so that's a bonus.  You don't have to wonder too far from your hotel to find a fun place to hang for the night.
My boyfriend and I did a spontaneous Vegas trip a couple weeks ago and booked a room at the flamingo. Prices were awesome at the time. We got the 17 or 18th floor with a view overlooking the pool and flamingos downstairs.  Oh and you could see that new Ferris wheel thingy too. . . There was a queen size bed, very clean and well kept (even after the remodeling of the hotel) and had switch controlled blinds. Best part ever! We get kinda lazy lol. . . The casino and everything was well kept and everything just looked nice even if it was an older hotel on the strip. Now my tip: don't wait in the long line for checking in. Head over to their I believe players counter and get a membership. Then you can ditch that long line you're in for non members and wait in the much shorter faster line for members only. My bf has the best tips and tricks he pulls. . . All in all it was a good stay.
I stayed here for a Bachelor Party and we had a room on the 19th floor. I did not book the room, my friend did. With the number of Hotels on the Strips, I would be fine with never staying here again and here is why:. . The bathroom in our room was gross. Not like dirty gross, like outdated gross. The rooms were clearly updated recently, but not the bathrooms. The bottom of the door was rusty looking. The shower was SUPER dark (is it hard to install a light above a shower?). Put it this way, if i purchased a house and the bathroom looked like that I would gut it right away. . . Nothing makes you feel like you are in a nice elevator then elevator floor lights not working (yes this is some extreme sarcasm). I know nothing about elevator maintenance, but that has to be an easy fix. Seriously, there were lights out for the 19th floor button (and others) in every elevator I rode and I rode at least like six different ones. This may seem minor, but if they cannot fix the lights what else are they not fixing. . We used the bag check both coming in and leaving. I would say the experience was weird. Both days had a healthy line and the workers did not seem like they liked working there. When we were leaving the worker must have put our bags in water on the floor and then immediately accused us of sneaky in whisky (even though we just told him twice that we were checking out). So we had to open our bags and show him all of liquids were in zipolac bags since we were flying home that night. Clearly, this man 1- doesn't know what whisky looks like, because the fluid on the floor was water 2- was not paying attention to us telling him we were leaving 3- doesn't understand how carry on bags work at the airport. At least , my friends and I have a fun new inside joke! Also, getting our books pre flight was not very straight forward. There is a clearly marker Bag Check area, just no workers around it so you have to go find workers yourself.. . Finally, 8 of us got in the cab line to go to the airport. The worker directing people was like "The shuttle was about to leave to airport, get on it". We did and we were thinking it was free, because the worker made no reference to paying for it. Nope it was $7 a person. For a couple of people that would be a better deal then a cab, but it is probably pretty close to being more expensive for 8 people. I would prefer they let you know about the $7 charge and let us decide what we want to do. . . If you get this hotel at an amazing deal, I would suggest that you book it, but I know there is better places on the strip.
Beyond upset with my stay here. I only decided to stay here because my cousin wanted to stay here and we were all doing a big trip and just wanted to not be a hassle to walk to a different hotel every day.  Booked this room on Black Friday of 2013. The deal was good! I kept calling then since then till about June to make sure everything is okay and make some changes since I decided to stay longer. (YES I WAS IN VEGAS FOR 7 DAYS NEVER AGAIN) lol. Anyways so I get a email from total rewards about 2 weeks before my stay for a room up grade. So instead of being in my go room with two beds and strip view I upgraded to a 2 bed in a mini suite. The total was $1234 for 7 nights. Not bad...right? So we get there and check in. My party of 3 was there when I was checking in and I ask the Filipino lady with short hair who was working June 17 between 10pm-11pm and she said twice to me $1234 so of course in there diving the total so I can get the amount from the 2 other people.  And the $200 something incidental charges. And we would get reimbursed if nothing was wrong in thee room.  I was upset she never mentioned if the hotel gave me a credit for staying there towards maybe restaurants or anything in Vegas. Which I did apparently, look through my emails. Partly might fault I should have read my emails before going. HOWEVER my boyfriend works at a hotel and they tell all their guest about all the freebies. I'm not trying to be cheap but it would have been nice to be informed that. So we get request a roll out bed. She actually was nice to tell us that we would get it at no charge and we should have it soon in the room. We actually went out and got drinks and we got to our room by like 11pm and my boyfriend went out and he got back before I did which was 1am and STILL NO EXTRA BED. He actually had to call and remind them. So we get to the room and I look around the bathroom is pretty dark.... They need a light in the shower or something. I look online what the room would look like it said we would have a tv in the bathroom...NOPE! No fridge, no microwave and no strip view oh and a dinosaur tv. My cousin had a go room with a nicer tv. I was shocked. I paid more and I get a shitty room. The housekeeping wasn't good. The 6nights I think they only cleaned it 2-3 maxed? Not only that my boyfriend was for the idea to tip the house keepers. They have a job why should we tip them especially if they don't do there job right. We actually ran out of toilet paper one night and had to tissue paper. We cleaned the trash can out and had to use that to put beers in with ice as a nice chest. The next day we get to the elevator and the button in the 21st on the right side facing the window was broken like stuck inside, I mean you can still use it but that was just not acceptable. So the second night I leave my wristlet in the cab yes that is my fault but I walked to lost and found and they basically told me it takes 5-6hrs to look at the tapes so they can say what cab company I was riding with. So they just gave me a list and I called and left a message but no return. So I decided to go back Friday morning and see if maybe they found it. 2 employees were in the hallway as I was waiting for someone at lost and found to help me. I knocked twice and no one opened the door. I pick up the phone and it's ringing and finally an answer. I was so upset that I lost my wallet with ALL MY MONEY AND CREDIT CARDS AND DEVIT CARD. Yes being in Vegas with no form of money is TERRIBLE. So I really wished they could have helped me but the guy that answered said no one returned nothing and I told him "I'm here till Tuesday the 24 can you look at the video from June 18." And the guy said "umm yeah I don't think no one is going to want to do that right now cause we have other things to do than look at the videos" EXCUSE ME IM IN VEGAS AND IM WITHOUT MONEY. I'm paying for my room just like everyone why can't you help me? And I'm actually telling you, you have like 3 days. Do you really have to be a jerk and say that? I leave because I am beyond mad in his response. I give at this point and don't even bother with it cause I had all my stuff expedited. So we finally check out and everything was decent.  However today 1 day later (today) I forward my boyfriend the hotel stay and it's $1533. WHERE THE HELL DID THESE CHARGES COMES FROM THE LADY SAID IT WAS $1234. Looking at the charges, I was never aware of a resort fee. And not only that it looks like the deposit I paid wasn't applied. And then that stupid charge. AND WE DIDNT GET THE  INCIDENTAL DEPOSIT BACK.  We didn't break, steal, or damage anything.I am so upset with this hotel currently waiting on a call from josh the manager and she what they can do because I am furious. NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN.
This hotel is getting very dated.  Great location and that's about it.  Parking in the garage is horrendous.  All the way up to the top and no spaces.  Plenty reserved for the valet and Hilton Vacation Club though. . . Once inside you will most likely be accosted every time you walk through the lobby by very aggressive sales people trying to sell you time share rooms.. . The rooms need a major upgrade. The walls are thin and anything going on in the hallway or 2 or 3 doors down, you can hear every word.  Not the best at 2 in the morning.  The paint is peeling and the night table and desk drawers are too narrow to hold anything . . Check in/check out - do the express otherwise you could be waiting on line for 45 minutes.  Then of course it's about another 10 minute wait for a very crowded elevator. . . As with many other reviews, there are plenty of other hotels to select and that would be my recommendation.
We will not stay here again. Parking was insane and we we couldn't get valet because we weren't casino members. Other casinos in Vegas we have not had this issue. We had to park way out behind the wheel and cart our items in the heat. The parking garage was conveniently full. We got in and staff was not overly friendly. In the room the hardwood floor was nice but our shower leaked all night and the walls were dingy. We won't stay here again, you get what you pay for in Vegas.
The hotel room was fine. It's a little older, but it's ok.  We usually stay here for the pool and normally I'm happy with this hotel.  However this time I am very upset.  I was in Vegas to get married and most of my guests booked rooms the Flamingo. My mom rented a Cabana in the family pool which cost her $500 plus alcohol.  What makes me angry is that the adult pool had a special DJ so they were charging $20 to get in.  Also because of this special guest DJ they blocked off the hot tubs and other parts of the family pool.  My mom wanted to get in the hot tub and was told no.  I'm sorry, but you did not tell us when we booked this cabana that we would not have full access to the pool and spa.  I think it's ridiculous that you would charge someone $500 and not tell them that they would have limited access.  You could have told us when we booked the cabana.  Instead you were happy to take our money and block us from the pool.  Nice.. . Additionally, my groom booked a cabana on the adult side for the Friday before.  When my mom called to book her cabana they told her the adult cabana was also $500 for Friday.  I called two days later and was told the same thing.  When my groom called the next day to book the cabana they were like too bad so sad.  There are only 2 cabanas left so we just jacked the price up to $800.. . My family and friends spent close to $10,000 between rooms, cabanas, food and drink at the Flamingo alone and that is how we get treated.. . Also, even on floors higher than 17 don't plan to sleep before 3 am because the Mexican restaurant plays dance music so loud you can hear the lyrics that high up and feel the bass rattle your room.
Good luck finding a parking spot in the seven-floor parking garage. Huge sections are reserved for the following: valet, Hertz, some kind of unaffiliated Hilton club, disabled folks, maintenance/security. If you don't crash into someone before you've passed all these sections, you *might* find a spot on the uncovered roof!..if you're lucky. . . The garage empties into the gift shops, so be ready for sexually suggestive imagery, people trying to squirt stuff on you, and miles more walking before you get to the registration desk. . . If you're luckier still, you'll get a room in the Habitat tower and have to walk another mile to the elevators. If you brought luggage, have fun finding the ramp!  . . The shower had this creepy vent the wings of which could *not* be shut. I hope there wasn't a hidden camera in there. . . At night, the ambient Friday noise from the Lynq block party was loud enough to disturb us in our 12th floor room until at least eleven PM. . . The place only sells Pepsi products (just a personal peeve), too. . . The 13 dollar per day per computer wireless service wasn't fast enough to sustain a more securing VPN connection. . . If this has been a personal trip (and not business, i.e. paid for us), I would have been really pissed.
We stayed at the Flamingo for our wedding weekend! We absolutely loved the location and the amenities offered at the resort including the casino, the pools and the late night eateries! . . Our room was very nice and clean and had a great view of the strip! We were extremely happy with our choice in a hotel and plan to make the Flamingo "our" Vegas place! . . I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clean and nice room in a fantastic location this is where you should stay! The only reason we did not given it a 5 is die to some of the surroundings that still need updated...but it definitely does not effect the stay!! . . The staff in all capacities were friendly, helpful and great to work with!
So disappointed with the  Flamingo Hotel and the way they are treating my son and daughter in law. He is in the military and this is their first chance to have a few days alone without the children in Vegas. They were so excited  about having a Go room overlooking the strip, but they are so upset with the way they have been treated. Their room stinks of smoke, and they were told that they could change it  if the room still smelled after they sprayed it.  Not so, the girl on the desk  denied all knowledge saying no one ever changed rooms for that reason. . I finally called (I'm the one babysitting and recommended the Flamingo) and spoke to a manager called Josh. He grudgingly offered that they could change their room to a lower floor as he said that they were sold out.. Last time I stayed there, we were upgraded because of the smell of smoke, these days you get downgraded!!!!!
I'm a longtime Harrah's player/stayer.  I've stayed at all of the properties and Flamingo has always been a fun place to stay, even if it could be updated.  . . HOWEVER - with the Cromwell opening next door, and the ENTIRE SIDE of the building facing Bellagio and Paris engulfed in NOISE from the rooftop pool nightclub...until 4am...it SHAKES THE WINDOWS.  Worse yet, it's all techno crap.. . It might be ok if you're 25 and don't care about sleep (we've all been there) - but if you're a longtime Vegas player/visitor like me - go somewhere else FAR FAR AWAY from the Cromwell pool.  I blame Harrahs for ruining Flamingo - they own Cromwell too.. . Oh, and because I was so pi$$ed off about the 4AM window shaking BOOM BOOM BOOM from Cromwell - the other flaws in Flamingo (dirty carpets, unreliable elevators, slow check-in) became that much more evident and irritating.. . AVOID FLAMINGO IF SLEEP MATTERS TO YOU AT ALL.
