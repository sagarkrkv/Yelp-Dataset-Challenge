This hotel is so beautiful. I have stayed here the past few times I have been but I am not sure that will happen again. I took a nap of the couch in our suite and I woke up to a rash on my arm!! I am not sure if they are bug bites from bed bugs or what it is but I know they were not there when I went to sleep. Gross. Be careful if you come here!
Had a boat ride it was sooooooo romantic I'm really shy so didn't like, Hugh crowed of onlookers recommend for shy people have a few drinks first and don'twear heels very rocky get on and off.all boat drivers can actually sing they sing twice.you cam share a boat with another couple for about $40  or private for $78 we did the private one.Ride is about 13 min long.Awesome experience.
It was my first trip in Vegas. My girlfriends and I stayed in Bella Suite. The room was beautiful! It had beautiful receiving hall. Also, it had two large 50" inch LCD television. There is one in the bedroom and in the living room.  Also, the bathroom was large and I loved the toilet because it had it's own room. I admired the well lighted mirror in the bathroom. There was a vanity and closet inside the bathroom. It was a lady's dream. I admired the bed! It was comfy. Also, Wallgreens was right outside the Venetian which it was practical. The Fashion Mall, Wynn, and Encore was few minutes walk. I took one star off because the fax machine's printer in the suite did not work, which it was inconvenient for me. Also, the wifi was slow. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Venetian. I am willing to stay there again.
It was really a great sty. I've stayed on the strip at some of the other higher end hotels but this is ALMOST right up there with the rest. Incredibly well maintained, amazing rooms with those great large perfect bathrooms and rich looking spaces. Big Screen TV... I think 50"... but who's watching! Location, Location, Location. It is at the center of everything. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are a few others that are. I don't want to list them because I don't want to send people elsewhere. It is though amazing and all that Vegas should be!
Such a great staff of friendly, helpful people. At every turn, when we were lost, not only would the staff help us with directions but give us advice of where to go in the hotel AND outside (where to shop, dine, hike, even where to take great photos).. . When finally exhausted went back to our room and met with a comfy bed and delightfully soft pillows. My husband sleeps without pillows and found the bed to be perfect. . . For those that don't work out I say start here, take the time to explore the gym, our favorite part of the hotel. After a great work-out they have great smoothies, blueberry, strawberry...$5.00 from 7-2. . . The Canyon Ranch Cafe has great food and healthier choices. We recommended it to an older couple and saw them later, they so enjoyed!. . So, go, enjoy, workout, maybe book a little spa trip....then go up and have some wine and gamble - you will be in tip-top shape!
I do have to say that their all suite hotel rooms are my favorite rooms on the strip.  We had a huge living room attached to our room.  Probably our second favorite rooms are Paris.  This review was for rooms alone.
Highly recommended.. . The Venetian takes the point of view of designing a resort that has a casino rather than a casino that has a hotel and it is a very important distinction that shows, from the luxurious rooms to the quality of the room service and that the staff provide.
Stayed 5 nights and everything was excellent. . . Easy check-in, clean room, 3 working TV's  and excellent house keeping.. . Add the great location on the strip - it's an easy 5 stars.
This is my first time staying at this hotel. It's really nice, and right on the middle of the strip, but you're definitely paying for the location. The room is nice as well, but I've stayed in other hotels here in Vegas with way nicer rooms at half the cost.. . I love all the shops inside the Venetian too!
My fiance and I booked a room here when we came for my brother's wedding. I was excited to stay at a high end hotel in Vegas! We booked one of the regular rooms. I think my overall experience there was okay. The room size is decent and the bathroom was clean and had a nice vanity mirror. The bed was clean, huge, and comfortable. Although when i came home I started to get some itches and rashes. But I have sensitive skin so it might be due to a different detergent. A few cons: our room door kept malfunctioning while trying to swipe our hotel key. the view was less then spectacular with the roof of the hotel, the complimentary bathrobes was starched so stiff you can almost surf on it, and when my fiance tried to sit on the couch some wooding was sticking out in the back.  A bit hazardous! I think the general layout is lovely but it needs a bit of renovation and fixes. The casino there was great though. Surprisingly we had fun and won a bit also.
I've book this hotel for my 2 year anniversary with my husband from June 1st to June 6th. Let me tell you... definitely not a disappointment! I was in LOVE all over again! It was very beautiful and very spacious! The downside and complaint I would have is the mini-fridge. Since they stock it with all of their drinks, we were unable to store our bottled water in there (unless we want to remove it and pay the consequences with an arm and 3 legs... NO THANK YOU!). Oh, and there also isn't any microwave in the room either. My husband had to go into the canal shop (which is also a part of the Venetian) and ask one of the restaurants to see if they can microwave our food for us. Luckily, they did. The pool area is also very lovely. They had several pools with different sizes which was neat. It made me feel like I was really in a foreign place.. . I will definitely stay here again.
This is a 5 start hotel.  The rooms are no joke!   It's like they are all suites. . . Amazing huge fluffy needs brings a new meaning to sleeping on a cloud. . .  They had a full sectional couch with a fold out Bed in the living room.. . 3 tvs in the roon one is in the bathroom
This is the 2nd time I have stayed here once about 9 years ago fantastic clean rooms. upper scale casino.This time I stayed upon checking in some 20 year old dropped there half rack of beer on the lobby floor . Ok got to my room 4th floor, the previous guests garbage still my room and light bulbs burnt out.. the 4th floor is the same level as the pool loud floor with a lot of drunk fowl mouthed. young people throwing there plastic beer glasses on the floor out side the elevator,and taking about how big there parts are.would not stay there again if you are 20 years old and just want to party and get drunk and listen to loud music this is the place for you.
Decent rooms and you don't even have to walk outside for shopping! Nice big pool, and Tao isn't bad so long as it isn't packed. Can't beat great shopping in your hotel!
I was at Venetian Hotel at 1 month ago, and my camera was stolen inside the hotel. It is a very experience camera and I ask for the help. The security department of the hotel said they didn't see any camera, than I asked that I they can check the security camera record to find the thief, but they refused. That time, my heart was broken because of the lost camera, it was my everything.  It feels like the hotel really doesn't care their customer's proper, they ask interested in make money.
I know I always get confused when it comes to walking round at all these hotels in Vegas,but Venetian is the queen of confusion! The hotel is pretty darn nice and fancy, and thank god I split the suite with 100 other people. Just kidding, only 6 of us. Well since it was EDC weekend, the price for the suite was around $825. But you know what? This price is pretty good because I got a great view of Encore beach club, the Trump tower, Treasure Island, Mirage, etc. The suite I got was so nice and big. The couch that was given to us was an L shaped couch, which its long enough for 2 people (one short friend and one tall friend). The two queen size beds were comfy and they feel clean. The beds are definitely not for people with back pain because the beds are super soft and bouncy and you will sink in. The bathroom is big but not that impressive. I guess the only cool thing about this is that there's a TV in there. Yes, I was watching family guy while taking a shower. Speaking of shower, there's a bathtub and separate shower stall. So if you're not going to use the bathtub, then use it to fill it with ice and put your alchies in them. My toilet room was really dark and the door to it was sorta broken because it wouldn't close all the way. The overall door to the bathroom is a double door so the gap between the two doors had a gap. So if you are staying with a creepy friend, be careful.. . Other than the rooms, everything is nice. The elevator is fast, the staffs are nice, and security is high. The restaurants are expensive here, and same with all their bakeries like Bouchon and that Cake Boss dude. The shops here are more on the high end. The cheapest store I know here is actually Walgreens and maybe Sephora. Im not sure if they have any buffets here though. The casinos are of course expensive and they have your typical slots machines and tables. Overall, this hotel is clean and safe, and it's a once in a lifetime stay for me. (well....unless I make $$)
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #140 - #365. . The Venetian is one of the older bigger hotels in las Vegas. Built on the former Sands site and opened back in 1999 along with Paris and Bellagio. The theme here is pretty obvious it's Italian just like Bellagio.. . The plus side of the Venetian is it's an all suite hotel and the standard rate is at $129 with player's card. Look at it this way, "who spends most of their time in the room while in Vegas?" Unless you're bringing a huge group of 8-10 people and splitting the room bill. The Venetian is just as massive as the Bellagio and the casino is designed to confuse you so you can't find your way out and instead end up spending more money in their tables or slots. . . The pluses:. . -Replica of the Rialto Bridge. -Grand Canal Shops. -Venetian facade by the entrance. -All Suite hotel. -Location between the Wynn, Palazzo and across from the Mirage. . -Great pool complex. -Walgreens outside by Sephora. -Food Court next to the Grand Canal Shops. -Wifi in the rooms . . The cons:. . -Huge size. -Smokey Casino. -15 minute walk from the room to the strip.. -Resort Fee. . The Venetian has similar room rates compared to Wynn. So I'll just take my pick and stick with Wynn/Encore because they seem more upscale and private compared to the Venetian. Or if I'm looking to book a suite, I will go with the Palazzo because it's newer. I feel the rooms at the Venetian need a major overhaul. It may seem luxurious, it's just feels so outdated and I noticed a lot of dust on the furniture. . . It's a nice hotel with great perks it just doesn't compete with Wynn / Encore.
Luv the room!! It is well worth it with spacious living room area separate from the sleeping area! The deco is fancy and modern worth the price. If you are club member, should upgrade to different suite and Oh, don't forget to dine at Grand Lux Cafe! Superb food!!
Decent rates and the facilities were clean. The gym and guest pool are ALLLL THE WAY on the other side of the hotel though. It was like a maize to get there. For someone with joint problems and needed quick knee therapy, the gym was a long walk. Staff members were alright if you needed help. You have to take multiple elevators to get pretty much everywhere within the hotel. Housekeepers were loud as my note requested them to just replenish what was needed, quietly. I wouldve given the tip had they just been in&out, but they didnt follow the request and kept knocking on the door, yelling housekeeping, and slamming doors. . . This is a very nice european inspired place to stay at. The bad thing? We stayed in the bella suites, which was nice, but whoever though abt the functionality of the room, didnt really do a good job. There was no fridge to hold food that we took back. The mini bar fridge wouldnt even do as it was not a cold fridge. The restroom had no ventilator.  The restroom room itself was inside the bathroom, so if someone was showering, you couldnt go in there as the shower was made of glass door and the tub didnt have a curtain. Also, both the restroom and bathroom door didnt have a lock... And the bathroom doors had a gap where the doors met. The walls were thin, you can hear people using the restroom/shower. If that was the case, they shouldve switched the bed area with the sunken living room space.
This has and always wjll be my hotel. Owned by the same owner as the palazzo both these hotels are very nice designed and maintained. Great restaurants, sushi samba and carnivino, and atmosphere. . The nightclub or lounges aren't great in this hotel but the Wynn and encore are the next hotel down walking distance. . The rooms are nice a spacious. Not very contemporary but still nice
My first time staying here and I loved it!!!! Wow!!! Last time I was in Vegas The Palazzo was under construction so it was nice to see it completed. There is lots to see and experience, so come prepared to take it all in. All the rooms are suites and very spacious. Aside from Tao restaurant there is also Tao Beach, so if you are here during peak season, don't forget to check it out.
Extraordinarily beautiful hotel inside and out. Our first interaction was with Chelsea who accommodated us upon check-in. She was genial, informative, and energetic despite the late hour of our arrival. A good first impression!. Our room was spacious and luxurious. A large bathroom with marble sinks and private toilet coupled with a huge suite featuring two large TVs and a beautiful view of the pool areas and the red rocked mountains in the distance. The bed was very good but not great. It tended to feel worn and by the end of the week we yearned for our home king. The bed wasn't bad, but certainly forgettable.. The interior of the hotel is cavernous and the details spectacular. The varied and vast restaurant offerings will have you questioning your need to leave the property. We frequented Tao nightclub and it was electric but crowded. The doorman expedited our entry and waived the cover probably because of my wife because the guys in front of us didn't earn the same favor. We don't tend to be clubbers, but I was impressed with the sound system, ambiance, and clientele. A little rowdy and loud, but that's what clubs are for. We also went to the Bourbon House for two nights to close things out and disappointingly the music had little variation. It is 80's themed, but the same music was played each night. Our waitress was brutal and the guy who served as an MC was as cheesy as it gets. . For cheap eats (relatively speaking) we ate lunch one day in the food court. We had pizza at Social LIfe and it was actually one of the best pizzas we have ever had, and I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. We did the build your own and it was extraordinary and filled us for the rest of the day. . Many people have commented on the smoke in the casino. I gambled less than I had expected for that very reason. Inhaling smoke from every direction was the best way to keep me out of there. I am surprised that they don't do a better job with filtration or segregation of smokers. . Our last night there we returned from another casino and the Valet service was brutal. No one would give me a ticket and the one employee named Harry ignored me and brushed past me when I asked him if anyone was available. If a resort boasts five stars, there can be no missteps. I asked the next valet (Chris?) if it typically takes this long, and he said, "What do you want me to do, I am the only one here.?" Ironically he wasn't the only one there because the first gentlemen who I parked with was more rude than Harry, but I didn't get his name. I empathized with (Chris) because he was the only one hustling. Waiting ten minutes to have someone give you a ticket for your car is a bit much particularly after a long night. We got in around 11 PM, so it wasn't as if it was rush hour.. Overall the hotel is extraordinary and I would gladly stay there again. The level of service is vacillates between top-notch to disappointing. We tried the Concierge desk late at night and instead found a Guest Services agent who was curt and devoid of knowledge. Given that I have only been here once, I don't know if this is the norm or the exception. The pool area is tremendous and the grounds are meticulous. A great place for couples or friends who want to have a good time in Vegas. I would recommend for those over 30 as the vibe is more traditional. We barely scratched the surface in our four days there, but is there ever enough time to uncover everything in Vegas?
My second time staying at this hotel and there could only be good things that are said about this hotel this second time. I like that their room and bathrooms are spacious and always so clean. I love the Venetian and if I could stay here every Vegas trip, I would. . . The place makes me really feel like I'm on a vacation. The relaxed feeling I get from Venetian is astounding. I love the feeling of sinking into the comfortable bed each night and having a restful sleep. During the afternoons, I went to their smaller pool to relax where there are fewer people. . . Cheers to another pleasant stay here at the Venetian.
With so many choices of hotels in Vegas, this one isn't the one to choose. The furniture in the sutie was worn and looked quite dirty. So much in fact I refused to sit on the couch. Yes, the decor is supposed to "feel" Old World but isn't supposed to actually have been used in the Old World - yuck!
