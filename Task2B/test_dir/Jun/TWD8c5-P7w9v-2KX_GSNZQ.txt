I know it's already been said on here but it's not an understatement when someone says this is one of the most beautiful Casinos in Las Vegas. Place is pretty large, you can actually get lost if you don't watch where you're going!. . Day after day the maid service is great, they make sure your room is taken care of, it's very refreshing to be able to come back to a room that has fresh sheets, fresh pillow covers, fresh towels and all. They leave your room spotless.. . The only reason I took a star off, is the pool area.. It can be very hard searching for a seat, you'll be lucky if you can get one. The gazebo's are $700 a day to rent and the bartenders can be rude when they are busy or was our experience when getting drink from Todd.
I went here with my company since we had our annual meeting here. This was actually my first time in Vegas and it was amazing!! Pretty much everything you expect from Vegas but when you are there it is way better. . . The rooms we had were great and very spacious and had everything you could want. Since we had a lot of our meetings here we also were able to try all the food they normally prepare. All the food there was AMAZING as well. The snacks they had for us was also great and I spent a majority of my time in the hotel and didnt even know i did not leave that often. The staff is great and they will do anything to help you. Next time I am in vegas I will probabaly stay here again!
BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH. First of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.. . We also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.. . We selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. . . When we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.. . . The standard room, was dirty.. 1. Hair on bed and pillows.. 2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.. 3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.. 4. Wrong bedding. 5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. . We Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?. 6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.. 3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. . . THE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.. 1. The view was nice, but that's all.. 2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, . 3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. . 4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).. . HE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.. . . ANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.. . ROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, . we came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. . .  NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. . As soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. . . THE FORTH ROOM, . FINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. . . . HERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED. . CRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.. . A SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. . . IT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE. I WOULD RATHER GO TO THE RIO, or the hard rock.. . WE want is a complete refund of time, to book someplace else without stress. . LOVE RIO!
We had a great time here.  The pools were awesome and actually kid friendly.  I only have 2 complaints about this place.  Only one good hand of blackjack out of 20, and no refrigerator in the room.
The worst experience ever. Don't ever stay there!! They gave us a room that smelled like throw up, after complaining the moved us to a so called suite. This room was from the 70's. Had a broken shade and broken phone and dry boogers on the comforter. Manager came and all they could say was sorry and I had to wait over two hours for one to show up. Now there is a bug into room . Never will I stay here!!! Ever
I stayed at Mandalay Bay for the Lionel Ritchie concert on June 6.  Its a long trek from self parking to reservation desk. There was a long line at reservation desk just like MGM Grand.  We waited about 15 or 20min wait to the desk.  The reservation lady was nice.  She was handing out water bottles as freebie.  The elevators are always busy and some of the elevators don't automatically closed so you would have to close it manually.  Very annoying!  Our nice room is average and nice except the bed was soft.  The bathroom is nice and clean.  Our cleaning lady finally came to clean our room on Saturday later afternoon before she went up the next floor.  Best feature it has a tram to Excalibur or connected to Luxor by walking through the shopping mall.  They have 2 starbucks and each end of the casino floor.  There seem to be less slots and less people gambling.  Its very sad to see.
They have asked my to contact them, and sadly I have twice since the review. Who ever asked that has not responded since.
I have stayed at the Mandalay Bay several times over the years and I am afraid that the quality is deteriorating. I see many more stained carpets, trash left in the halls etc. The food choices are abysmal. The buffet is way overpriced for such mediocre food. I understand that is must be difficult to ventilate such a large casino area but sometimes it is absolutely horrible to walk through the casino because of the cigarette smoke. . The staff is friendly with one major exception: a young woman that works in the quick shop by the elevators was extremely rude to customers.
I am not a Vegas kind of person, as the gambling, drinking, etc. are not appealing at all.  However, a work conference was held at the Mandalay Bay convention center, so it made sense to stay at the same hotel and minimize traveling around.. . I must give the hotel credit for being quite well-run.  The room was large enough and had plenty of closet space, and the view of the strip and the airport from the 26th floor was quite impressive.  . . To give on example of being well-run, let me point to check-in.  I arrived at 11 AM on a Saturday morning to find a very long line for check-in.  Those early morning flights from the East Coast arrive around that time, so I should not have been surprised.  I thought that I would wait in line for an hour and find out that no rooms were available until the 3 PM check-in time.  Then I would have to check my bags with the valet and wander around for a few hours.. . Well, I was wrong on all accounts.  The wait was maybe 30 minutes.  They had rooms available and were able to put me on the side away from the pool and the loud Sunday night pool parties.  And the hotel was not really any louder than other ones I have stayed in.  So, I wouild stay here again and recommend it to anyone else.
my favorite casino on the strip. service is always really good. staff always friendly and professional. mandalay beach is a good place to see a concert too!
Randall, Rob, Catrice,and Willie at the wave pool we're the best ever. They were nice and very helpful! Ill come back just for them :)
I was invited by a major toy company to join them at the Licensing Expo this week at the Mandalay Bay convention center. The combined booking value of exhibitor space plus hotel rooms for the entire staff is in the neighborhood of $100k.. Due to a minor billing technicality with a couple of rooms, which company resolved immediately, I was refused entry to my room and I was personally threatened by the rudest front desk manager to have me removed by hotel security, unless the billing issue was resolved. No apology was given to me, and when I calmly pointed out the sheer rudeness and disrespectfulness of that manager towards a hotel guest, she said that I was "entitled to my opinion".. Maybe it wasn't a coincidence that upon leaving the front desk my colleague and I were hustled by two young hookers in the lobby. Mandalay Bay has clearly sunk to the lowest level, and I would advise any potential guest, not to mention corporations to take their business elsewhere.
I love this place but this time around it treated me very wrong , Came there with a group of 12 had 5 rooms rented 4 of us showed up at 2pm and the rest of our party showed up at 9;45 pm . the room was under our friends name who attends this hotel often and even with him on the phone verifying who he was and giving us permission to enter a room ( we offered a credit card) would not let us check in. we had to purchase another room and told that when our hosts arrived that we would be refunded our money likely!!! Because we had reserved so many rooms and just transferred to there bill. Not the case at all we were not allowed to check our bags because we were not the renters on the agreement. So we rented a room to change in thinking that we would just stay in the room when our hosts arrived at the rate arranged per our hosts... Not the case charged full price and treated very rudely when trying to organize the chaos. we werent looking for a free place just to check in an hour early. we had the host on the phone with the manager giving us permission to check in with credit card used to reserve the rooms(also a vip player by there standards) and still we were forced to rent another room on top the 5 we reserved . I gotta say i love this property but we were here for a good time and i spent the first 3 hrs of my vacation bickering back and forth with front desk. Then when our hosts arrived we spent another 45 minutes with vip services and they flat out said sorry do you want the rooms you reserved or not...i know it was a busy weekend i understand we were there to have a good time we werent rude due to most of us being in the service industry we just wanted to have fun and enjoy our surroundings at a price we had agreed upon.... We were treated poorly and it totally bums me out because we have had so much fun here in the past. our group of 12 spent a significant amount of money here AGAIN!!!! But i think in the future we will look elsewhere due to the fake promises and outlandish rules
Michael Jackson show is here!. Dont forget your id for the pool.. . The pool is great.   Sandy areas, wave pool and a river, multiple bars. . . The room was a bit dirty.  Eww. I found a bug in the bed.  I asked for all new bedding and i just got a pillow sheet and blanket.  I changed the bedding and i always bring disinfecting wipes when i travel.  I wiped down the phone, light switches, tables and bathroom.  Everything needed a good cleaning.. Always check your sheets before you settle in.. . No chairs in the check in area so i had to sit on my luggage or the floor.  . . There is a starbucks in the hotel for morning coffee but it was packed at 11am.
had to update this due to how ridiculous this is...after several calls to the director of risk management to, at the very least, complain about how rude the woman in her department was, with no call back, I instead received a letter from her.  The letter said that she knows that I have been trying to get a hold of her, but that she wanted to say that there is nothing that she can do about my claim.  Hu? Seriously? She couldn't take the time to just call me back, but yet instead writes a letter, and just assumes to know why I was trying to call her?. . I gave up.  Just blown away by the stupidity and complete lack of care for my claim.  I'm sure that's just what they wanted.. . Lesson: If you're looking for a job in Las Vegas either become a valet at The Hotel, because according to their own management, valeting your car there is like "giving your car to a stranger"....so therefore valets there are no better than giving your car to a guy on the street and hoping your car and it's contents will be OK.  . . OR get a job in risk management and just master the art of making the people feel like it's their fault for taking the risk to come to Mandalay Bay/The Hotel and shift all blame off of the hotel.
As south on the Strip as you can get sits this gorgeous golden high-rise.  I'm tempted to say I'd rather be more centrally located on my next Vegas visit, but I don't know.  I really enjoyed Mandalay Bay!. . The rooms are pretty swanky, in addition to being very spacious and comfortable, though our romantic bath for two did turn into a comedy of errors in the way-smaller-than-it seems bathtub.  It really is far from everything.  There is a tram that takes you to Excalibur and the taxi line moves along quickly, but if you plan on spending a lot of time on the strip, walking will be a pain in the ass.  Blisters, blisters everywhere!  . . They have an entire beach situation going on complete with sand, a wave pool, lazy river, etc.  We spent an entire morning cruising around the lazy river in some inner tubes.  It gets pretty packed, so come before 11 for some solitude and relaxation.  There are many dining options, but the one you should go to is Border Grill!  Like, every night.  Don't even bother with the other ones.  Oh and I had a delicious pasta from my first ever room service experience!  . . In all honesty, we ended up staying here because it was the only place under $400/night we could book a week in advance of a holiday weekend.  And I want to think I'd want to be more central next time, but in reality I'd be whining about Border Grill and the lazy river all weekend.
Ok, so on first thought, Mandalay Bay seems SO FAR AWAY from the rest of the strip (aka, where life happens at Caesar's, Bellagio, and Aria). HOWEVER, upon visiting, my bestie and I discovered that there's a convenient (AND FREE) monorail that goes to both Excalibur and Luxor. Problem solved.. . Beautiful hotel with beautiful gold windows. Home to Michael Jackson One, House of Blues, and an abundant number of shops, such as LUSH.. . I'd have to give this 5 stars because it's probably the ultimate couples' hotel. Perfect for a romantic weekend, secluded enough from the action, yet close enough to it.
The valet was the worst I have ever seen. I've been waiting over an hour just to get my car valeted.  It's seems that 10 cars at one time is too much confusion for them.
I just recently stayed at The Mandalay Bay because my regular (The Signature) hotel was booked.  The entrance to the hotel from Las Vegas BLVD is a bit confusing so pay attention. The check in process was long and it reminded me of a check in line at a busy airport.  Once you get past all that.  The rooms are nice and clean.  I liked the view of the pools I had from the 20th floor.  The staff was really friendly and helpful.  However, bring your own snacks and drinks the in room mini snacks are crazy expensive (like $8 for a bag of peanut M&M's).  The pool area is well worth the value by it self.  There are several pools that are family friendly and comfortable. They have a lazy river but you have to buy your own tube at about $25 for a big one and $20 for a small one.  These are tubes you can buy at Target for less than $4, so its your call.
It is inconceivable to me that an organization in a competitive business like the casino business could be as tone-deaf as the Mandalay Bay.  One hour wait times for check-in are a constant here.  They had four clerks working registration when I arrived. A supervisor was standing there checking her nails. When I complained, the clerk looked so used to hearing the complaint  that he offered me an upgrade before I finished a sentence.  The promised follow up from customer relations never came.   When the clerk started to tell me about the wonderful restaurants on site, I told him he was crazy if he thought I'd spend any money there but would gamble and eat at another casino.  And this was just to check in.  I can't imagine what they'd do if I had a real problem.
I was so disappointed in this hotel. I'll list the reasons for my poor rating in the order of the experience. If you don't want to read everything, just know that this hotel is a huge impersonal machine. All they want is your money and if you don't have a great experience, they don't care, because there are tons of other suckers out there that will fill their rooms. The only people that were nice to us were the bell hops, who helped us with our luggage.. . 1. The valet parking was full. Granted, this hotel is huge, but if you have a huge hotel, you should have the appropriate amount of parking available. Since we also had a trailer, we had to park in a remote part of the parking lot and walk forever to get back to the hotel in the heat. There wasn't an entrance to the resort near the parking lot.. 2. The line for check in was extremely long. When I finally got to the desk, they did not honor my reservation for a king bed. They said they were out of those rooms and I had to have two queens. I asked what the point of making a reservation for a particular type of room is if they don't honor that. They said that the room choice is just a "preference" and if they can accommodate that, then they will. To me this is poor planning. If I had arrived a little earlier maybe I would have beat the others to get the type of room I wanted. When I've made reservations online before, I know there are limits on how many of a type of room is available. So, they should be able to plan accordingly. They were extremely unapologetic about it. . 3. When I tried to log in to the free wireless internet, there was an error. I called the service desk and when they asked me if I spelled my name a particular way, they spelled a completely different name. I told them that wasn't my name. The person tried to look up my reservation and couldn't even find me as a registered guest. This took the person about 15 minutes of calling others and figuring out that the person who checked me in made some mistake. Again, they didn't do anything to say sorry or make things better by maybe upgrading the wifi. . 4. The pillows were like hard lumpy sacks. The decorative pillows were softer and more comfortable, but they didn't have regular pillow cases on them so it wasn't comfortable to sleep on.. 5. When we checked out, we again complained to the desk clerk about the poor experience. He didn't care one bit that we didn't enjoy our stay.. . I will NEVER stay at this hotel or another one owned by the MGM group of hotels/casinos in Las Vegas.
My son wants to stay here because of the lazy river and wave pool. Two days before my vacation,  I got an email on Thursday before my Saturday vacation that I can upgrade for a suite at The Hotel for $15 more. The website told me that I will get a confirmed email in 24 hours. No email was sent out. I emailed marketing and got email back said no upgrade.  Disappointed.  I ate at Bayside buffet and the food is not good at all. Can't believe it at all. My son did not like anything at all. No mac and cheese or slider for kid. I could not find anything that was good to remember. Resort fee $28 is not worth it.  The room is good size but do not trust cleanliness.
Awesome place to stay.  We arrived late dueto a flight delay and they had already given our room away.  The woman at reception apologized and then proceeded to upgrade us with a bigger room with the best view of the strip (in my opinion). . . The pools were why we decided to stay here and we weren't disappointed.  Two small pools, a lazy river, and a large wave pool (only one wave every five or ten minutes though). The pool vibe was much tamer than I expected.  Daylight (day pool party) was going strong, but steep cover charge.  . . Great food options around the casino. The bars inside were pricey, but to be expected.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and would come back.
Lesson Learned NOT to stay at this place in June! Next time I will stay at Aria or a newer hotel. Staff was polite....they did their job. Our housekeeper was the friendliest person we came in conact with!!!
The hotel is beautiful and a bit far from the strip but I am rating 1 star because of their customer service.... . DO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE THE LIQUOR. even to read it or look at it; YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR "SANITARY REASONS". If I had known I was going to be charged, for something I did not drink and it was still sealed, I would have drank it. However, I didn't so I'm paying for liquor I did not use. I had brought my own liquor and went on the strip to drink so I'm pretty P.O.'d that they are charging me $95 for two small damn bottles I could get for 20$ together... The main reason I did not bother even opening them or give them a second look. I think it's absurd how it's for sanitary reasons yet there was a big STAIN on my sheet but I tossed that aside and used my blanket I brought along instead to lay on and staff has to handle the bottle anyways. I wasn't really going to be in the hotel anyways (I was gone all day except for between 5am to 10am each day for the 4 days I stars there). . . I called customer service to dispute it exactly the day after when I noticed it and she was rude and did not give a **** and kept repeating herself three times when I did not ask about what she was answering with. I mean, sure I have the funds but the point is I was not aware or given notice of that charge. You are customer service for a reason - do not be rude. If I am paying over 700$ for a 3-day stay, I do not want to have an unpleasant experience. . . SO DO NOT MOVE THE LIQUOR OR ELSE A FINGERPRINT WILL GET YOU CHARGED. CHECK YOUR BED SHEETS (As. You should always anyways) and prepare to WALK far to the strip.. . I will not be taking my service to any MGM Grand hotel any further and I will let everyone I know to be careful or you will get a bunch of unwanted charges. Thanks for reading!
Thought it was a four star found out its a one star. Reserved our room a month ahead of time. Thought we were getting a king size bed. I was told they didn't have any available but they would put us in a queen for the night and check with them in the morning after 11. So did that same freaking excuse. Spend most of the first day stuck at the hotel thinking we might be moved to a bigger bed. . Never made it to the pools but we did see one. Looked more like a water park for kids than a relaxing time for adults. . If you stay here just be sure you're in great shape cause it's a ways down to get a good drink. The slots were nice but the best way down the road and cheaper to play. Yes, you can take the free monorail to two hotels up the strip, there's your star! . Staff was rude! Except the cleaning staff they are really nice, said good morning to us every morning as we went to get our coffee cause guess what there isn't a coffee pot in the room!!! Starbucks is making a killing. . The place is pretty but there isn't much to see if you just looking for the glitz that you expect for Vegas. Just avoid this place unless you like "vanilla"!
I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED MY TIME HEAR.. These people work round the clock to keep this place clean,even after 1000's of people have used it. The elevators are  and fast,at some times can be very busy. I ejoyed a casino coffee bar where a bagle an chreem cheese with my moca~coffee was breakfast of champions. The rooms are fantastic with these hugh bathrooms for taking care of business, the room room technitions made sure we had clean bathing towels every day...Thank's also  Their closets have alot of space for clothing.. I will be back to enjoy the hotel in the future.
If only I could I would give zero stars... We won't be staying here again. Check in at 10 am took over an hour just in line (check in is technically 3pm we weren't expecting such a wait.) When I finally got to the desk my reservation was not right and my comps were not showing correctly. The woman refused to check into anything to make it right despite me calling three time the past month to re confirm the correct comps and reservation. We booked our hotel over three months ago for our anniversary and they were more than happy to take our credit card and be so incredibly helpful and sweet when we booked, they supposedly added a request for a high floor room with a strip view to help us celebrate our anniversary.... when I arrived I was willing to wait for the room because I knew I was early for check-in (I called the day before to confirm the room again, jut btw) We ended up on the 8th floor with a "lovely" view of the parking lot. It was horrible. 8th floor isn't exactly a high floor lol. After dealing with the incorrect reservation and calling concierge, only to speak with yet another incredibly rude woman regarding my comps for the spa I was pretty much over our stay. But I dull had a spa reservation...Check in took so long and our flight was late yet I called Mandalay Bay Spa 2 hours in advance to cancel my spa appt (they require 2 hour cancellation) but I sat on hold for 30 minutes....which apparently gave them the opportunity to just charge me for the services even tho I couldn't be there in time due to check in and out fight. I spoke with another concierge as well as the spa manager and they refused to be of any assistance, except to just charge me. After finding this out I decided I just may as well make it work and by a near miracle, I ran as fast as I could to the spa and made it to there in time for my appt. Only to find increasingly rude service there as well. I was escorted to the entrance to get my robe, slippers, key, etc and there was no attendant.... I waited for five minutes and still no attendant.... I had to walk back out to the lobby and the only lady willing to even acknowledge me was visibly annoyed by me coming to "bother" her to get some assistance just to get a locker key and robe. It was just a terrible experience by the spa check in staff and for no reason....I was honestly beyond nice to the staff despite the confusion on my appointment and I was still treated as tho I was an inconvenience. I am a five star spa veteran and have never experienced such rude service in my life. The facilities were nice, but half of the showers were not in proper working order. Overall just a terrible experience at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Spa. My husband and I have stayed here before and had a nice time so we expected the same this time for our anniversary but we will not be staying at Mandalay again due to the horrific customer service by the concierge, front desk and Spa. We ended up actually leaving and staying at The Wynn where we were upgraded to the 53rd floor (not our "high 8th floor" at Mandalay lol) Wynn gave us one of the most amazing views at boo cost and no hassle!!!! We are recommending The Wynn and will stay away from Mandalay!
check in line sucks been standing here forever. You'd think they'd at least have all the front desk spots open and working.
