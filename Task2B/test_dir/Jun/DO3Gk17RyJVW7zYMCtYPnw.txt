The Tiger shrimp and pork tenderloin were awesome. If you're very sensitive to spices though, you might not like it.  Otherwise, my only minor complaint was that the shrimp were small but so delicious. Service was impeccable.
We went to Mesa Grill with high expectations. The selections on the menu were enticing, and we settled in for what we hoped would be a very special meal. Overall, the experience was quite disappointing. My wife ordered a steak and was very specific and emphatic regarding how she wanted it prepared, but the waiter decided on his own to adjust the instructions to the kitchen to what he thought was appropriate. The result was an undercooked steak, relative to my wife's very specific instructions. My selection of rabbit with risotto was good, but nothing extraordinary. Our overall experience was "so-so" food, not prepared to our request, and very high prices. There are far better places in Las Vegas. We will not be back to Mesa Grill.. . I would not recommend this to a friend.
Mushroom quesadillas phenomenal. Chili relleno was excellent and the banana cream pie was perfect.  This is truly a great restaurant.
My husband practically runs to get here. . The bread basket is free and filled with jalapeno poppers, blue corn muffin, chocolate chip scone, and chocolate bites...each time just a little different, depending on the time of year - last time a to-die-for cranberry bar! . We started with Pear cactus iced tea ($4.00), and coffee ($4.00) brought promptly out. Always love that. . I had the seasonal soup, a bit pricey at $13.00 but oh so tasty - this time it was sweet potato with a touch of peanuts on the side. Then Sophie's chopped salad - romaine (not my favorite kind of lettuce - I prefer kale), black olives, a few bites of cheese, and tomatoes ($13.00). My husband had the Chiliquiles ($16) eggs, tortilla, jalapeno and cheese. Spicy but not not enough to make you sweat. . They will bring you more bread, of any kind if you ask ...don't files up because his food is so tasty...I never make it to dessert! Next time!!!
Delicious. Maybe not the best steak I've ever had or lobster I've ever had, but by far the best seasoning and spice I've ever ever had. Awesome.
We went here for dinner last night . I must say it was very good . I had the New York steak and mashed potatoes . The potatoes were the best ! The steak was tasty. Our server was very attentive, although not the friendliest. It's pretty pricey .. But worth it !
The food was awesome!! I would highly recommend the coffee rubbed steak. The service was great and the waiter was very helpful. A must go to in Vegas!!
Excellent! Had the goat cheese fondue and it was delicious. The peppers in the cheese is what made this dish. I highly recommend this appetizer. I ordered the tenderloin and it paired well with the tamale. It's on the spicy side but the tamale balances the heat with - mild sweetness from the corn. I wanted to give this a 4 star but the pork was a but on the dry side. I tried the chicken and it was moist and tasty. I had a peach margarita and it was refreshing with the right balance of alcohol. I will be back again!
I really enjoyed my meal at Mesa.  For starters, my friend and I split the chicken quesadillas.  They were so delicious that I regret offering to share.  I ordered the salmon as my entree which was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  . . However I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars due to the small portions and the high prices. My friend ordered a $13 salad as her app and it looked like a $5 salad.  We got better salads down at the food court. My expensive salmon didn't come with any sides.. . With that said, I still enjoyed the dinner and would go back again.
We dined here on 06/05/14.. . Was super excited to celebrate my husband's birthday at this restaurant. . . The waiter was extremely pushy regarding the drinks and I felt as though he was constantly rushing us through ordering and our meal.. . Appetizers were blue corn pancake with duck & blue corn lobster tacos. Both were OK. The duck was covered in a lot of sauce for my personal taste buds and was a touch boring. The taco was OK but very underwhelmed.. . I ordered the filet medium and husband ordered the NY strip medium. It was explained to us that medium was PINK. My steak was medium rare. I told the waiter and he said that was what he told me. OK waiter person, whatever you say. I just wasn't in the mood to fight with him.. . The sides were very good. The horseradish twice baked potato and the corn cojita.. . Was disappointed in the dessert after just one bite.. . Credit Card was authorized for the total of the bill $194.00.. After tip the total was $244.00 and that was also authorized on the credit card.. . The $244.00 was charged on 06/09/14.. The authorization for $194.00 is still on my credit card as of 06/11/14.. . Grrr...
After witnessing one of the top musical acts of all time, we walked into Bobby Flay's upscale, modern Mexican restaurant, Mesa Grill. While we were ravenous, it was also quite late for dinner so we hesitatingly opted for a few small plates to share. Being the mad foodie that I am, I had already studied the menu and knew that the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were an absolute must. We also chose the Crispy Squash Blossoms and the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla.. . Stuffed with ricotta, corn, and basil, the fried squash blossoms were also sitting in a pool of sweet pepper sauce. My goodness, these unique fried treats were righteous as ever. After devouring a blossom, I snatched one of the most miniature tacos I've ever seen. The Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were insanely luscious. Filled with delicate lobster, pickled onions, avocado, and topped with a fennel and habanero relish, I was licking my chops with every bite. Let's just say if I was into cursing on my blog, there'd be a few choice words written in all-caps to describe my love for these tacos. I'm just sad I didn't catch a good photo of the beauties. . . For the rest of my review, visit: http://dashofles.com/blog/west-coast-road-trip/
Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is an fresh take on Southwestern cuisine.  Hand crafted margaritas are featured on the drink menu, and the dinner menu is built on a foundation of corn and chili spiced proteins.. . We wanted something with tequila in it ASAP, and were happy with the margarita and basket of house bread and blue corn muffin that arrived.. . We started with the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos. Fresh, light, and delicate in texture, the two bite tacos were tasty though perhaps missing their lobster flavor.. . For Entrees we tried the Ancho Chili-Honey Glazed Salmon which I asked for medium-rare, and the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, served medium, with Sweet Potato Tamale.  The salmon was super tender and moist, but unexpectedly mild in flavored, we couldn't really taste the glaze.  The pork tenderloin was incredibly tender and juicy and we used the tamale to sop up the sauces.. . The entrees come ala carte so you'll want to get some sides, we tried the Roasted Corn and Collard Greens.  The Roasted Corn is a superstar.  Sweet summer corn is roasted, but still crunchy, creamy and spiced from the aioli, brightened with lime and cilantro, and sprinkled with salty, tangy cotija cheese.  The collared greens were pretty standard, but made us feel like we ate our vegetables.. . Overall we liked Mesa Grill.  Thefood was well prepared and service was attentive and helpful.  This would be a great place to eat and drink with friends.
Really everything comes together perfectly at this place - our service from hostess to waiter to bus boy was flawless yet friendly and relaxed. . . I started with the lobster taco and my husband had the duck pancake - both seasoned exactly right. My veal chop was huge and the waiter wisely suggested I hold off on ordering a side - he was sure right! The combination of maple and horseradish with the Southwestern flavors was balanced and new. My husband had the strip steak with a side of corn - also dead on in terms of prep and seasoning.. . We really weren't hungry for dessert - but who cares? We had the chocolate cake (a bit sweet) and banana cream pie (beautiful - again an ideal play of textures and taste).. . A great dinner to close off our Vegas trip!
We dined here June 11th.  We've been twice before with better than average results but this meal was surprisingly good to us ... the best of our trip that included Andiamo, Joe's, Ruths' Chris and Vic and Anthony's.. . I had the tried and true southwest pork tenderloin and it was excellent! Served with a corn tamale sweet potato made perfect.  it just couldn't have been better.  My wife had the Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale and raved about it.  We shared the roasted corn appetizer which was truly scrumptious. Everything gets an A+!  . . I tried the signature agave margarita as we'll and while I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.  Give it a B.. . Our short visit with hostess was cordial and our service team was excellent throughout.  Timely, with helpful menu insight and very pleasant personality and attitude. A+!
Meh.... Expected a lot from Bobby Flays restaurant and it failed very short of my expectations. I have been to Chef Morimoto's in Napa Valley and the food was fabulous there
I came here with my brother and sister to do an iron chef's tour of Vegas.  Mesa grill was the first stop.  . . I asked the waiter for a recommendation on the appetizer and he recommended the tiger shrimp tamale.  It was fantastic!  It's so good that I've been watching YouTube videos of bobby making it and am determined to nail this dish.  I ordered the lamb chops for main and it was the best lamb chop I've ever had.  . . What gives with the 4 stars if everything was awesome?  Well, my dishes were excellent, but my sister ordered the grilled chicken and my brother ordered the veal chop.  Being a food curious family, we shared our food.  The grilled chicken was just ok.  Think of a properly grilled piece of chicken with some fancy buffalo wing sauce.  The veal chop was recommended to be cooked medium so we went with that.  Well, it may have been medium on the tip of the edge, but was raw by the bone.  . . Looking back, the waiter did say excellent choice when I ordered the lamb chops.  I suppose this means the other items we ordered were not a good choice.
A nonconsensual eating experience happened here when they delivered bacon filled rolls to our ravenous, just walked 3 miles down the strip, table. Vegetarians beware!! Everything we ordered was so so. The corn side dish was my favorite. Drinks were fine, nothing special. Queso fundido was stringy, collards were pale, translucent semi-green. Must be better options for us veggies!
Overall entrees were good. Expected more of an experience as a whole from this restaurant though. Entrees 4 stars, experience 3 stars. . . Complimentary bread (1 star): Very DRY. The only one in there that was okay was the corn muffin, and that still wasn't even that fresh. Other than that the jalopeno cheese and walnut bread were super dry. Scared me at first cause I thought I chose a bad restaurant just from how the bread was. Good thing the rest of the meal turned out better. . . Grilled Chicken (5 stars): Very moist and flavorful. Mashed potatoes were great too. . . Lobster Out of the Shell (4 stars): Lobster itself was bomb. The hominy cakes underneath it, meh could have done without them on my plate all together. Very dense and not very flavorful. Lobster and sauce on the other hand was so good, but really, those cakes were just horrible! Try changing them to mashed potatoes or something.. . Came for my birthday but they don't do anything special for you!! )= They will only put a candle in whatever dessert you order. But come on with the money you spend here you can't bring out something small that's complimentary? It just makes it feel more like a celebration when they do that. The desserts didn't sound that great either. Probably wouldn't choose this for a special occasion dinner because of that.. . SERVICE (3.5 stars):. Our waiter was nice, hard to find at times, and just really busy with all the other tables he was helping. Took long to get things we requested, or he'd forget and we had to remind him. . . I don't know if I'll be back here. The entrees were pretty good, well half of the lobster dish was good. Maybe I'll try appetizers more. But the overall experience was just bleh. And that bread...aye...make fresher bread! Or better bread if it was "fresh", bad first impression right when you sit down.
This place is fantastic. We started with the goat cheese fondue which was excellent.  I ordered the Veal Chop which was cooked to perfection.  I also ordered the sweet potato au gratin.  It was almost like a desert.
Mesa Grill is a Bobby Flay owned restaurant- cool! The restaurant seems big, but I didn't get a good look around. We sat in a corner booth, which allowed for privacy. . . The waitress brought out a breadbasket, which had a variety of bread. We also got two free appetizers, because they sent it to the wrong table. Luck was on our side.. . I went with the signature dish for my entree- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I never had pork that tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth tender. I also loved the little bit of kick it had to it and the sauces. The dish also came with sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Both spicy and sweet represented on the plate. I liked the tamale but it wasn't on the same level as the pork. . . I left with a full stomach and a great impression of Bobby Flay. In the future, I'll seek out his other restaurants.
Just to note- if you have dinner reservations here, do not get day drunk and pass out. You will wake up in sadness that you missed a dinner reservation at this delicious spot (true personal story).. . We opted for lunch instead the next day, because we knew this was one spot we didn't want to miss out on. All those times I drooled watching Bobby Flay do his thang on Food Network, it was all to be fulfilled. . . Three things we ordered: . Tuna tartar - appetizer. Spicy chicken hash. Salmon club sandwich. . Everything was yummy, but let me emphasize how especially great the spicy chicken hash was. I was almost disappointed by the sandwich and tuna because of how good the hash was. Tuna was good and club sandwich was good but it wasn't exceptionally great- and I was really looking for mostly exceptionally great. If you haven't figured out my not so subliminal message, just get the spicy chicken hash!. . A vegas dining experience wouldn't be one without booze, I absolutely loved the peach margarita. It was perfect and refreshing on a hot summer night in Vegas. Boys, don't be ashamed of the peach margarita- it is definitely not that fruity. Trust me- I drink like a man (unfortunately?). Peep out this spot, I'll come back for dinner someday,
This was my first visit to a Bobby Flay restaurant and boy did I love it.  First off everyone was super friendly and had smiles on their faces.  I liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  I had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  The only thing I did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. It looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  I loved loved loved the Ancho salmon it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  My hubby had the pork sandwich and all he could say was wow this is really good.  We also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  Goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. My one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. Hehe I can't wait to go back and try other things.  I was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the shrimp tamales those smelled delicious. Yes my husband is embarrassed of me when I look at other people's food but I can't help it.
This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. I discovered it years ago, but I am just getting around to talking about it. Everything. that I had was good. From the duck tacos to the spicy bloody mary. The food has a gourmet flare to it and the presentation is exceptional. It ain't cheap, but worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and skip the buffets. Save your slot money and have an excellent meal. You will love it. . . My favorite meal is the spicy sweet potato hash for brunch. Insanely good.
I absolutely love Mesa Grill! Thank you Bobby Flay!. . Full of stunning textures and flavors! Outstanding food! Outstanding service! Outstanding place! A must try!. . I have tried quite a few items on the menu, and I have not tasted a bad thing! Must try the goat cheese queso fundido! And DO NOT skip the bread basket- lots of scrumptious goodies to try!
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. My hubby had the filet mignon which was awesome and I had the scallop special for the evening which was also great. I got the mashed potatoes as my side, they were good, but I liked my husband's twice baked potato with horseradish better :) . . We would definitely come back if we are in the area. Be sure to try the banana cream pie and cactus pear margarita--AMAZING!
