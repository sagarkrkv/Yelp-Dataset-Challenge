I LOVE THEIR DESSERTS because of their QUALITY.  As  Vancouverite from Canada, we have similar french passeterie cafes. The prices of Jean Phiippe desserts are reasonable  because the french pastisseries are normally priced like that even in Vancouver. However, J.P. Patisserie is beyong good quality. I don't know why? Is it because of the chocolate ? or I really do not know. I  I always drop by  whenever I am in Vegas  just to have their desserts. I should definitely try their chocolates next time.
Oh my word. My mouth waters when I think of this place. Dessert heaven. . Every morning I'd have their plain sugared brioche with an OJ. Simple but simply delish. Pretty much every dessert or chocolate or macaroon I tried was wonderful. I only tried one candy that I didn't care for (they were white chocolate covered pistachios and I bought them for the hubs - underwhelming, but they looked pretty!)!
My first experience with Jean Phiippe was at the Bellagio. Beautiful giant chocolate flowing fountain, and an abundance of variety of sweet treats. What caught my attention was their mini wedding cakes that we considered as an extra novelty gift for some friends of our who are getting married next month. The sell by date was 5/22/14 but the employees stated that they couldn't sell them (which I thought was admirable) but then soon after said that the label was a mistake as they quickly removed all of the packaged mini decorated wedding cakes off of the display shelf. They encouraged us to check out the Aria's Jean Phillipe Patisserie for a possible different variety of mini wedding cakes. NOTE #1 - the JPP retail store at the Bellagio was packed with customers!. . Arriving at the Aria, I forgot my reading glasses in the room so I needed help in the microscopic labeling on almost all of their packaging - the font is the tiniest that I have ever seen. Our server was Andrea R. . . Though my wife and I were loading up our arms with products from their counters one at a time, I asked Andrea three different times to read the title only of the unique candies & cookies that I had never seen before. Andrea was getting increasingly bored and annoyed with my desire for CUSTOMER SERVICE so after the 3rd question of mine she literally walked away from my wife and I and walked around to the other side of the store to chit chat with the server who was the crepe maker. NOTE #2 - the JPP at the Aria had zero customers in the retail store side! When Andrea was finally even more bored with her conversation with her counterpart in lackluster customer service (sorry I didn't get her name) she came over and asked if we were ready to pay! I replied with "No, I'm still trying to figure out what these things are". And I went all the way around to the complete other side of the almost circle to the only girl of the three who was actually smiling to ask one last question.. . The complete antithesis to what customer service is - and in a visually nice and hopefully quality tasting store - WHILE THEY HAD NO OTHER CUSTOMERS - and while we spent $129 on gifts!! I so thought of asking for a manager but knew that their couldn't be one managing these three young ladies and hoped and prayed that one of the three of them did not carry that title! And then of course, thank God for Yelp! SO sweat not need to ask for a manger!
Yes, it's  a bit pricey for what it is, but for a Vegas establishment, this is consider cheap eats!. . I always come here whenever I stay on the strip.  I just love looking at the dessert display while my super hearty chicken crepe is getting made (by the same girl every time!).  The key lime pie dessert was so good, I finished it before my crepe was done cooking.  The sandwiches on the other hand are a bit pricey for what it is, I'd rather go across to Earl's.. . Oh I almost forgot about the coconut gelato....just...get it.
Amazing breakfast crepes!  The salmon crepe is HUGE!  You could easily share it with another person and still be stuffed.
you get what you pay for....high end pastries from a high end pastry chef.  No wonder Aria stole this guy from the Bellagio.  Ever since, the Bellagio's pastries have gone down hill fast....morning time business too.  . . . Get the Sugar Brioche....delicious!  Best in Vegas by far......great almond croissants too!. Can't go wrong with this place....only downfall is that word is out and this place will be crowded.  So be prepared to wait in line!  The Cafe Mocha awaits you!
Absolutely amazing... Worth every penny!!! This is the first time I've been here and I gotta say I'm definitely coming back!!
This is my must have every time we come to Las Vegas! Desserts here are amazingly beautiful and equally delicious. I would recommend anything chocolate and the raspberry tart. Recently my boyfriend ordered the Snickers and it was so great, way better than the candy bar so much more decadent.
Walked past this place and had to stop by. Me and my friend shared the triple chocolate mousse cake. The best mousse cake ever! It had white chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse and dark chocolate covering half of it. With a tiny green macaron on top. THE BEST EVER. highly recommend this place! :)
Although I did not taste the food at this shop, it was well worth the walk to Aria to just walk around and view all the stunning artwork that this staff has created from chocolate and sugar.
Best sweetest place ever!!!!! My friends kids always love to have their gelato!!! And I love to get Togo coconut tuiles. Decoration is very unique and looks very nice! ^^
"My Go-To place when visiting Vegas and staying at the Aria or Vdara for my morning or late afternoon coffee and pastry. The quality is superb and love the almond croissants which are always flaky and moist" highly recommend this place if you need a moment to relax after shopping or gambling"
Favorite sandwich spot in Vegas! Have not tried the one in Bellagio but I always end up at this one at Aria. It's like a little sandwich shop that serves their paninis and sandwiches on clear plastic plates but it still feels fancy in here lol. . Their smoked salmon sammich is a MUST TRY! Honestly I never ever thought that sliced onion and smoked salmon could go so well together! Well, they smack your palate like no other. OMG. It is the epitome of savory.. . Basil chicken panini is also a good choice! Everything was sooo flavorful and their sub/panini is perfectly heated and chewy and not overly dry or crunchy.. . One thing I didn't order myself that I had a bite of was the caprese panini. It was nothing out of ordinary, can't remember much of it but I recommend that you get a caprese sandwich at Earl's rather than here. Til next time :)
The desserts are great (that's why 2 stars),  but every other thing on the menu is premade and microwaved and tastes awful. For $10???  McDonalds does it better and higher quality for $1...  . . Been to the Aria for 3 years now and this resturant still sucks. Plenty of better places to eat.
Always a pleasure coming here. You can order a crepe either sweet or savory. Either choice is delicious. The pastries are out of this world. My personal favorite is the fruit tart. Simple, deliciously. Simply delicious!. . Their displays are always amazing and the food is fresh. Whether you order a ready made sandwich, salad, pastry, crepe, coffee or anything in between, you won't be let down.
I only gave it 2* because the food and pastries actually taste good. I would have given it 1* for product availability and service.. Here's our experience: a bit before 2pm we tried to get some croissants.  They were out of both plain and chocolate croissants. . Then, we thought we should get some real food and tried to get some omelettes. Guess what? They were "out of omelettes". . But the worst thing came when my husband ordered a crepe without whipped cream. He really hates that stuff so he mentioned it twice. He was offered a crepe with whipped cream, but when the crepe preparer saw his face, she realized what the problem was. So, IN FRONT OF US, she took the whipped cream from the crepe WITH HER HAND (gloved, thank God!) and rhetorically asked "Is it ok?" My huband said "no" so she took the plate, wiped a bit more of whipped cream and added some sugar on top, then gave it to him. In the mean time, I'm getting us some coffee and tea. I asked for honey, and, you guessed,  they were out. I asked them to make the coffee less hot; it was stil hot. The manager was nice, apologized for everything and found some honey for me. We are still very disappointed!
Got the exotic sweet crepe.   Mango and pineapple chunks in a sugary sauce drizzle on top with a scoop of coconut ice cream on the side.  The crepe was pretty thin.  Buttery.  The fruity topping was not too sweet.  The coconut ice cream was delicious!  Very creamy.  Rich coconut flavor and I can actually taste the coconut flakes. There's a nice seating area for you to eat at.  . . Next day came back to get the vanilla Napoleon.  Good.  The puff pastry was thin and crispy.  The vanilla custard filling was creamy and the right amount of sweetness.  Enjoy it!
