Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this Gem that wasn't  attached   to a Hotel or Mall. . we were greeted by a friendly host. The rest of the staff are very efficient & friendly.. Very Good down home Breakfast...good fluffy French toast with a touch of cinnamon.  Hubby ate the well reviewed  Cali  Omelette...I just needed stronger coffee but the good food and great staff was definitley 5 star worthy!
So glad I found this place on yelp. It's a very small restaurant, but definitely worth the wait. Very affordable and delicious tasting food. I recommend the Cali omelette! I'll definitely be coming back!
We thought we try this place since it got excellent reviews. The place seemed clean, open, and friendly. Wait time, maybe, 20 minutes. . . We sat down got our drinks for breakfast and we waited. They had plenty of staff, but our waitress took maybe fifteen minutes to take our order. We decided to try some of the popular itemslike Cali omelet, chicken fried steak, biscuit and gravy, and pancakes. Overall, the breakfast was good. Their homemade gravy was decent, but needed more pepper and flavor in the sausage.. . If I lived on that side of town, I would come back to this place. However, there are great breakfast places around town that I would try before coming back.
This place does a nice job of setting your expectations low, in a strip mall, off the strip, and plain decor.  But the food can stand on it's own.. . It's not fine dining.  It's no nonsense, quick and easy.  You'll probably get an omelet.  The advertise 4 eggs is about what you'll get.  Bigger than your average, but hearty.  You'll get what you expect.  I had the spanish omelet (2 cheeses, spinach, and avocado).  Omelets aren't too complicated, of course, but it was served quickly, a decent portion, and it was better than I thought.. . Service was good, fast, polite, and attentive.  (Thanks, Melissa!)
Went here aroud 11:30am on a Sunday, there was a bit of a wait for the 5 of us. 30 minutes or so, but did not mind.  All of us ordered off the lunch menu and enjoyed our sandwhiches.  I was looking at the breakfast items walking by and will definitely go back to order off the breakfast menu.  They are only open from around 6am-2pm 7 days a week.  So make sure to get there early.
Yes, I know it's only breakfast, but this place is amazing! Everything tastes super fresh and tasty! Expect to wait about 25-30 mins., but i promise you it is all worth it. Not to mention the staff is super attentive and nice. Am loving this place!
Super friendly owner, great service, off the beaten path, obviously a lot of locals, not fancy but acceptable furnishings. Food was very tasty with ample proportions.
Great food and great service! We stopped by here after seeing all the great reviews on yelp. This place definitely lives up to the hype. Portions are huge, the food is delicious, and everyone is so friendly. If you come to las Vegas or are in the area you need to stop by and grab some breakfast or lunch. We'll definitely be back!
Very customer focused down to earth staff& food is home cookin& filling. Very packed dining area butt staff makes you feel like you are the only guests.. Big variety in menu
First time here!  Service and food was awesome.  Staff is extremely friendly!  Owner is down to earth and interacts with everyone in the dining room.  Food was delish!  I recommend the country fried steak and eggs.  Definitely coming backnext time we're in Vegas!
Great spot for breakfast. Away from the Vegas strip, so great to get away from all the hustle.
From the outside, this non-descript, strip-mall restaurant doesn't look like much, but the food certainly stands on its own. Quick, attentive service and large, delicious portions make Mr. Mama's a great breakfast spot for Vegas locals or tourists who have access to a car. I had the Western Omelette - something I've ordered at dozens of restaurants but this was definitely one of the best I've had. As I mentioned, they are huge portions and you could probably split one with another person... but it's really good... and you may want it all to yourself!
The best sausage gravy !!!! Great customer service!! Short wait was well worth it. I would go here a lot if I lived in Vegas !!
Zero stars if possible. On my family vacay and was suggested to come here by my sister. Our friend had got there first and reserved table for us first but when we got there the guy with the clipboard put us at the end of the list. Really?? Later on Guy with the clipboard refused service because my fiance was keeping the door open for my family?! Really?? Throwing slurs at us and being all mighty with his clipboard? Racist jerk.
Love this place! Awesome prices... Well worth the cab drive over! The gravy is to die for along with everything else! We had the country fried steak, biscuits and gravy, and pancakes (4 of us split) good portions and good environment!
Only thing that beats the food here is the amazing family service wonderful breakfast place while in Vegas!!!
It was nice to eat at a real mom and pop place for breakfast after eating at over rated tourist trap restaurants on the strip.   The staff was very friendly and personable .  You can tell they take great pride in their establishment.  Was greeted at the door by Mr. Mama himself.  Place was full on a Thurs morning but we waited only 5 min.  We ordered Greek omelet , veggie omelet (all egg whites) and my kids had the short stack combo .  Portions are very generous!  Bring a hearty appetite. All the food was excellent.  The ham that came with the combo was a nice thick steak, not a thin dried out piece you might get at an IHOP or Denny's .  Our bill was only $42 before tip.  I paid $6 for a regular coffee at the Mandalay Bay so it was a bargain.  Will definitely make Mr Mamas a stop whenever we go to Vegas !
We ended up here as we'd needed to look at some kitchen and bath fixtures at a store next door. The wait was about 40 minutes, but it passed quickly. All the people lined up outside and speed walking across the parking lot to put their name down; I'll admit it, I was intrigued. . . Quick summary. The French Toast was the best I've ever had. I loved the cinnamon! I'm not a French Toast nut, but I inhaled this. Came with eggs and some bacon. - Standard stuff.  My husband had the California breakfast burrito and he was more than happy. He offered me a bite, but no - sorry, I'm way too busy with my French Toast. Our kids shared a pancake breakfast, per our servers recommendation. It was the perfect size. . . The owner, Nick was at the front of the restaurant. He was taking names and seeing that everyone was sat promptly. He runs a tight ship. I watched/listened to him sternly speak to his line cooks about an incorrect temperature on a steak, and thought to myself that you'd really need a thick skin to work there.
For non-locals, aka everyone coming to Vegas for The Strip, the location of this restaurant is probably super random. But trust my words when I say that it is definitely worth your while to find your way here as you head out of Vegas and you're needing to recover. And for locals, you've got quite a gem! It's as satisfying as breakfasts get. You get delicious and large portions of food served by super friendly staff, at a super cheap price. WIN-WIN-WIN.. . I had the Western Omelette and a side of hash browns. Each omelette is cooked with 4 eggs, and if you want to pay just a little extra you can have it cooked with egg whites instead. The Western Omelette is made with the perfect combination of sausage, mushrooms, green & red peppers, and green onions. The cooks get this combo just right, and its a large serving so be prepared to have a little extra to take home.. . We arrived right before 9 am and we waited about 5 minutes as they prepared a table for us. I noticed it got very crowded after we were seated though. Makes sense with how good this place is, so try to get there early! Plenty of parking available too as it's on a kind of strip mall/plaza.
Best Spanish omelet the wife and I ever had. Spinach,  Cheese and Avacodo were very fresh,  and they definitely don't skimp on how much of the ingredients they give you. The biscuits and gravy were amazing. Very impressed.  We will for sure come back when we visit again from Arizona.  We had read a prior review from 5 days ago regarding racism? Huh??? Lol... The staff was friendly and far from racist. Myself being Filipino from Florida, I know racism.  I am also a Phx Police officer and deal with a lot of fake people and s***heads daily. Sean and the other staff were more than welcoming to us and any other patron of color. They talk to EVERYONE and all feel at home there...I laughed when I read that review. And also, if youve ever been there, you know that it was a nice gesture  from staff for the other eating guests to ask someone to please not keep the door open from the 110 degree heat. There are tables near the door!!! Anyways. A great place, great staff... Enjoy!
Everything was freaking delicious and the service was excellent. It is priced fairly, in my opinion, and the dudes working here are super cool. They asked us how the food was, and we had some short, funny conversations with the owner/worker as well.. Portions are huge! There will probably be a wait, so while you wait, you will salivate!
Cali omelet was excellent. Had higher expectations for the biscuits and gravy. Had to wait for awhile but the quality of food and price were outstanding.
The best breakfast I have ever had. It was a 40 minute wait but it was completely worth it!!!!! I had the veggie omelet which was awesome. My mom and dad got the cali omelet which was the best omelet I ever had. Their French toast was also amazing. This place is great and you need to try it. I really recommend it.
It is obvious that Mr. Mama's takes great pride in what and how they serve their customers! Everything that we ordered was nicely done of the finest quality. . Example one: Side order bacon! This $3.50 side order blew my mind with 4 thick cut, meaty, perfectly done pieces that is a bacon lover's trip to heaven.. Example two: Our waitress brought to our attention that the toasts that she delivered may be slightly charred and she would be glad to replace them. We were startled because they were fine except for a tiny spot on the edge. More evidence that they try to serve only the best to each and every customer.. We'll be back!
My wife found this place on Tripadvisor as one of the highest rated affordable restaurants in Las Vegas.  We gave it a try and were pleased we did!  While it is located in a small strip mall off the strip with a very uninspiring front, once inside I could understand the rating.  . . The owner met us as we walked in and made us feel immediately welcome and important.  The staff was super friendly and obviously loved their jobs and represented the place well.  The owner also came over to our table once we were waiting for our food (a properly short wait) and told us about the picture on the wall as being from his grandfather back in Pontiac Michigan and the restaurant he ran during the depression.  The owner and his staff rate 5 stars alone and genuine hospitality and appreciation for my business is so unusual these days.. . I had a French Dip au jus and my wife had a Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  Both were very good, cooked well with fresh ingredients.  . . The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was that the food needed salt and pepper but in my opinion, that is fairly common these days with all the attention being paid to sodium.  A small price to pay (adding salt) for having a very enjoyable lunch while supporting a business that appreciates it's customers!  I will definitely come back next time in Vegas and I highly recommend this restaurant.
We always stop by for Sunday morning goodbye breakfast, & this place does not disappoint. My husband LOVES the chicken fried steak & eggs and the gravy here is SO good. The wait staff is friendly and attentive, coffee is never empty. We will most definitely continue with our Vegas breakfast tradition!
This has to be one of the best local places in Vegas for a good breakfast. The staff is amazing, the owner at the door is just the best and really makes you feel welcome.. . Now to the important stuff, the food. I love the breakfasts here. I have been here twice and can't say enough about how good the food is. If you like Chili, you have to try the Chili Cheese Omelet. Wow I love this Omelet.. . The Prices can't be beat, especially when your in Vegas.
Stopped by on the way home from vegas. Had the Cali omelet and hash browns and substituted toast for one pancake free of charge :). My hubby had the greek omelet. It was good too. The pancake was sooooo amazing. The best I've had. Everything is from scratch and you can taste it . Our waitress Julie was so friendly and nice. Even offered us drinks on our refill to go for our drive back to San Diego. We were shocked! No one has ever offered us that before. We were kinda shy and cought off guard by the offer . So sweet! The best service and best food. Will be back again.
I really enjoyed this place. Visited on 06/14 (Saturday) around 11:30a. Waited about 30 minutes for a table. Had the Denver omelet (4 eggs!, ham, peppers, and cheese), husband had the mushroom Swiss burger, little had a pancake. The omelet was delicious and so were the home fries. Husband enjoyed his burger (was juicy, NOT dry). Little one polished off the made from scratch pancake. . . Truly, it is hard to make out of this world breakfast food, but there's something about a good breakfast spot that smells of delicious fresh-brewed coffee when you walk in. The pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious. . . Staff was very friendly and checked on us throughout our meal. We never had to ask for anything. This in itself is worth another visit. And maybe another one after that......
Was treated to a birthday lunch at a new place. I had the taco salad and have been craving another one since. . . The portions are ridiculously big but the price is not. . . Service was attentive and friendly. . . Place seems to be busy but so worth the wait.
Greeted with a warm welcome, sat very quickly! This place is a well oiled machine. Great pancakes, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.. The sour dough toast was sooo good. Really nice staff too!
I love eating breakfast here, the owner is very nice and greets everyone who comes in. Food and service was great! I will definately come back.. . Prices were great as well.
Hope you love blue cause there's lot's of it! Decor is simple and clean with an open kitchen so you can see exactly how they're making your food. Maybe I could be totally off but it appears to be themed after "Greece" everything is blue & white with two large art pieces in the back of Greece. It's a very hands on and interactive setting, servers acknowledge you right away they're seen constantly engaging the guests which I find makes this venue even more warm and inviting. The menu had a nice personal touch to it and it "put a smile on my face." It's your traditional American fare breakfast, no twists or turns very minimal and basic. Being a fan of chili I had to give it a try. I ordered a western omelet with good ol has browns and wheat toast. My friend ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, and rye toast with only 1 yolk, I know she's quite the health freak. We both could not resist the chili and unfortunately we were disappointed, it's a little too sweet to be chili. My girlfriend stated the meat tasted like meatballs and the chili tasted like Prego. Nevertheless we were still excited for our food, the flavor of the hash browns were bomb! My omelet wasn't anything insanely out of this world but decent. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our hash browns and toast the most, the flavors were so good. All in all it's great value for the amount of food we ordered plus drinks, our bill came out to $24 which is pretty sweet deal for two people. I would return again just to see if there are any additional standout items.
Food/Taste: B. I placed an order for an omelet with american cheese, bacon, bell pepper and grilled onions with a side of hash browns, Texas toast and grits.  The omelet was good but after a while it tasted dry and like it needed some flavor (some salsa would've been perfect!).  . . Order Accuracy: D. My Texas toast because sourdough bread at pickup and my hash browns became onion rings (which come on, onion rings and an omelet doesn't even sound right! I know its Vegas and all but really!?!). . Selection: A. Very extensive menu and it's widened by many options that allow you to "build your own.". . Service: B. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and my order was ready.  The girl that took care of me had a bit of an attitude, but my day was off to a good start so I didn't let it get to me. . . Price: B. The price for my meal was around $15-17.  To me that's a little steep, but it was a lot of food and I was definitely filled up so I'll meet you halfway on this one. . . Other Thoughts:. Whoever is working the phones/pickup area needs to be an outside of the box thinker.  Like I mentioned earlier, some salsa really would've made a huge difference on the omelet and they included no sugar for the grits.  It just so happens my hotel has a coffee maker so I was able to find some in the room.  You are literally right around the corner from the strip so it's not that far of a stretch to assume that you're going to get a lot of tourists.  If its someone's first time eating here, they won't know the questions to ask when it comes to what comes with the order or what they should've asked for. Be that person that thinks outside of the box for us tourists.
I dont understand the great reviews. Greasy diner food, served up in an industrial strip mall, with average customer service. They are ok, but definitely not worth 5 stars! So many other options offering up better quality food and ambiance.
Absolutely the best place I enjoy going for breakfast whenever i'm  visiting Vegas.   Owner is a very pleasant guy to chat with.  He made a point to drop by each table to see how everyone was doing.   Be sure to check out the big black-and-white picture on the wall of his dad when he was a chef "back in the day".   It's only a mile or so off of the strip so not far.
I figured I would stop in before I headed back home.. . . The place is cafe style.  Very clean and busy like a place should be. I was greeted by a stocky bald guy who was just awesome and the perfect person to be up front. . . I ordered the cali omelette made with egg whites and homestyle potatoes well done.  The omelette was outstanding.. one of the best I had.. I didn't even need to add tabasco like I usually do.. the potatos were perfect and not burnt... . Staff was all friendly, very attentive and seemed to really appreciate the business... . Highly recommended!
I have had it booked mark for about a month now and finally could go. I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The reviews I read are in point. I really lived the food. We had to wait for about 30 minutes to sit but it was definitely worth the wait. It is a little small. I think they could use a bigger spot cause the food is great. Service was excellent!!! We ordered French toast, 2 orders of eggs which came with hash browns or home fries, and toast and was only 4.95. French toast was 2.50. Also ordered the steak and eggs which is a thin rib eye, home fries, 2 eggs and toast for only 10.00. Then we alsoordered the Cali omelet and that was 4 eggs, home fries and toast. Total with drinks came out to 35.00 for 5 people!!! The Cali omelet was so awesome!! Sour cream on top, sausage cheese and grilled veggies with avocado. Rib eye was juicy and flavorful not the best rib eye but great for a breakfast plate. My son said it was the best French toast he ever had too. Great for brunch too!!
Chicken fried steak and eggs rocks!!!!!!!  Service was excellent. Very attentive. Portions were big and prices were fair. Location was easily accessible with plenty of parking. Restaurant was clean and coffee delicious. We loved it. Great weekend breakfast spot.
Wooooow to this place! Me and my family usually always try to stop at a buffet before leaving town, but I yelped this place and it was scored 4.5 stars! I wanted to try it out! So we came here! Omg the food was amazing and filling! I got the special which was 2 breakfast tacos w/ a side and drink for $7, although the wait was longer then expected the food and outstanding service made up for it!! I was glad to leave town with a filling and happy stomach! I will be back here again!!
My first time, found on Yelp while in Vegas...  Food was excellent!! Service was great, from  the beginning to the end...
Good food, good service! Sometimes there's a wait, but I've never waited more than 25 minutes and it's totally worth it!
1. They don't serve freshly squeezed orange juice. . . 2. They don't serve fresh fruit. (only fruit cocktail out of a  can) . . 3. They don't serve real Jam. . . If you serve breakfast, and do not meet at least one  the criteria listed above, then your establishment belongs in the same echelon as Dennys. . . Why this place has 4 stars and 630 reviews is beyond me. I question if I even at at the right restaurant? . . During our wait, the host gave us a 5 minute speech on how "the owner buys only the freshest items for the menu". - Fresh like a can of fruit cocktail. . . The interior looks like a blue screen studio from Universal Pictures. . . I had steak and eggs. Steak was gray. Eggs were.... Eggs,  and... Nothing else to report. . . They should call this place Mr. Meh... . . Totally standard stuff here. Not the 5 star type of standard. The 2 star type of standard. . . Next time ill spare the 45 minute wait and go to Mimi's Cafe, at least they have fresh squeezed OJ, fresh fruit, muffins baked that the same morning, and decent breakfast.... . Sorry to kill the buzz here, but I am sure Mr. Mommy (if he even cares to read yelp) would appreciate some constructive and much needed feedback amongst the hoards of shallow praise. . . Go get some oranges.
Found this place through yelp. Service and food was amazing. I got an omelet asa scramble and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also toasted for me on the grill which I loved! ONE WARNING! The portions are GIGANTIC! I barely finished half my omelet. My boyfriend got the mamas and it looked like something out of man vs. food! If you hung over and hungry this is the place to go!
Strongly recommended this breakfast place!!! Owner is a very nice sweet mr mama! Food is a large portion that I recommended Asian ladies please share :) my husband loves their omelette and I love pancake and sausage! Even thought pancake and sausage is a pretty common breakfast.... But it made me ! super recommended to come here at least once for a breakfast in Vegas !!!! ^^
Let me say, this has to be one if the friendliest places I've ever been to! The owner greeted us as we approached the door. He also checked up on us during our breakfast. . . I ordered the Spanish Omelette, and it was good. Not the best, probably because of all the mozzarella cheese. My brother got French Toast, and it was amazing! I highly recommend that next time. I also tried the Breakfast Burrito, and it was delicious. I wonder how it would taste with sour cream.. . I'm glad I found this place on Yelp.
Everything we ordered was great. The country gravy is amazing!!! Everyone at the table ordered something different which worked perfectly because we got to taste 4 different meals. The steak was cooked to perfection. To top it all off, the staff is one of the friendliest groups of people I've ever met. Definitely a must do while in Vegas :)
Get the chicken fried steak! - The End
Food: AMAZING. One of the best breakfast places I ate ever. I ordered the Denver omelet which included hash browns and upgraded my toast to french toast for a $1. Everything hit the spot! . . Ambience: cute. It was very blue.. . Wait: Nope. . . Service: They paid a lot of attention! All the customers were locals except for us! LOL . . Will I come back:  Hell yeah! Every time I go back to vegas!
Went there yesterday, but didn't do a review. Small place perfect for what me and my husband like. Good selection of food. Not overwhelming like some places where you cannot decide what to eat. Finally a place where they cooked my eggs and hashbrowns EXACTLY how I like them. Only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is that they didn't cut the core out of my husband's tomato on his salad. Come on guys!  That's food prep 101. I don't want that on my plate.
Well, in my girlfriend and I's ongoing quest for the best breakfast around (that's reasonably priced), Mr. Mamas has entered as a serious contender for first place. . . After seeing all the great reviews on here, and looking at the incredibly affordable prices, we decided we had to try it. . . My girlfriend got French toast and I got the California omelette as a scrambler. . . My scrambler was INCREDIBLE. Seriously one of the best egg based breakfasts I've ever had. The sour cream/salsa/avocado on top really made the dish, and I happily finished up the 4 egg monster. . . The French toast was good, perfectly cinnamon, but not overly sweet.  I'm not a huge French toast guy, so I don't consider my judgement too accurate. . . What was also nice is that they had little coffee mate French vanilla packets. I haven't seen any other breakfast place offer something like this, and I don't know why! I love using flavored creamer in my coffee, it's one of my favorite things about drinking coffee, and having that option here with unlimited coffee just made the value that much better!. . The service was also great, and we really enjoyed chatting with the staff about the food and the restaurant. . . The decor was basic, but works just fine. I would say watch out Babystacks (our current number one), but the truth is they are very different. For an omelette? I'm going here. For a sweet breakfast of specialty pancakes and other sweet items, I'm going to Babystacks.
Mr. Mama's has caught my eye a few times so what better time to go check it out then on Father's Day? I decided to go earlier like a 9 am meet up time so when we got there it was busy but there were still tables open. Unfortunately we had to wait for our remaining party and their empty tables filled up quickly. We ended up waiting a good 45 minutes for a table of 6. . . I ordered the spinach/mozzarella omelet. A lot of flavor with yummy avocado on top! Who can beat that combination? Food came out fairly quickly after we got our order taken and they were so efficient for it being a busy holiday. My husband ordered the country fried steak and eggs and it was gone by the time we left so I'm assuming he enjoyed it thoroughly. There were no kids menu that I saw of so I just ordered a side for my tot. . . Overall, this place is small so get there early. When we left there was a bunch of people inside and outside waiting! This place is obviously popular for a reason and I definitely will be back.
I can't say enough good things about Mr. Mama's.  Good food, great service and  excellent prices. It's a breakfast trifecta. There will be a wait - but it will be worth it. Our whole table was pleased with their meal. And our server, Melissa was a real pro - friendly and helpful with perfect manners. Thanks for a wonderful meal!
Soooo it's breakfast, right, which is hard to screw up... but even harder to stand out. I was skeptical at first, because the prices were FANTASTIC and the decor is... diner. We had to wait about 20 minutes (but that was still an hour shorter than the place we tried before) but once we were sat the service and food was fast. The waitress was so very friendly, we felt like we'd met an old friend. Everything we had was super tasty, the gravy.. holy smokes. Great fluffy pancakes. We loved it, our kids loved it, when in Vegas we will certainly go out of our way to go back!
There was a little bit of a wait for our food, but our order came out perfect and the food was great. I had the banana caramel french toast and it was amazing. I came in with a group of 7 and we are all leaving with smiles. Steak was great, the Cali and Spanish omelet a were spectacular. The waitresses are so friendly and have great recommendations. If I ever visit Vegas again I'll be back!
I went a while back on the weekend and the girl that sat me was sooo rude!!! And unfriendly she really didnt make me feel welcomed. The food was alright not like how everyone makes it seem on the reviews. The egg and I is better.
