Bottle service at Marquee.. in one of the cabanas outside by the pool... Gorgeous people all around.. the music/dance floor is quite nice as well.. . Typical to spend around 3-4K a night.. but you get about 5 btls of liquor for that... good if you have a group of 10+ ppl.
First off, group of us (6 guys, mid twenties) came last year.  We heard about this V Card so we got one (about 50 bucks a piece).  Wow did it work great.  . We got to Marquee early (11am) pretty much like every other pool party to avoid lines and any problems since it was 6 guys.  The V Card took care of our cover and we went in real easy.  Since we were there early it was pretty empty but we didn't mind.  We got a good spot at the pool and started drinking.  From the little bit I remember, it did start to fill up and it got pretty rowdy.  Good times, we're back in Vegas this weekend and will be there.  We also will try the nightclub this year as well (also covered by the V Card).
Clubs and table service in Las Vegas are in a category of their own, so this review assumes you kinda know the drill when it comes to partying in Vegas and bottle service.  With that said, Marquee is one of the best clubs, simply because it is operated by the team who also runs Tao and Lavo (both in Las Vegas and NYC), as well as other top club/restaurant venues.. . Marquee always has top notch DJs. Location inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel is a big bonus, as is their pool and day club.  Lines will get ridiculously long, so if you're gonna try to wait in line (which I don't recommend), get there very early. . . Groups of girls really shouldn't have a problem getting in (provided they get there early), but it's always best to know someone who works there, or promotes for the club. Knowing the folks who run Tao or Lavo can also help. Groups of guys basically need to get a table -- and be prepared for hefty table minimums.  Mixed groups are better off getting a table as well.  It's worth getting there early, paying the high prices, and enjoying the ambiance and music that makes Marquee one of the top clubs in Las Vegas, if not North America.  . . I noticed a previous review about workers here being "ghetto" and "unprofessional" .... I find this very hard to believe, and perhaps might be the result of Vegas nightclub chaos and attitude that permeates all venues in Vegas. I know the team who operates these venues, and they are top notch folks who really know what they're doing, and make sure they pay attention to every detail -- especially the people who work at their clubs.. . (4.5 stars; I dock 0.5 stars only because it's no longer new, which plays a factor in nightclub popularity in Vegas).
Marquee Dayclub:. . Most pleasant dayclub experience I have had thus far! . . Let's start the review and break things down: . . Wait time: What wait? We arrived around 11ish-12 so it was not popping just yet. If you want fast entry than go around this time, there is literally no one waiting. (Should arrive around this time to guarantee entry for those on guest list). . Lockers: $45 for the whole day, I believe they only take card so be prepared. . . Drinks: I feel like drink prices are fair. You can get a full pitcher to share with friends for $45 in comparison to other dayclubs that make you pay $35 for those refillable cups sizes. Personally, I think that the drink deal here is a WIN! . . Music: During my visit here, it was the dayclub's reopening for the summer season so Kaskade was the DJ of the day. All I can say about the performance was I was SPEECHLESS and am at a lost for words ! . . Venue: I personally felt like it was kind of cramped. There needs to be more adequate standing area in front of the stage. I also did not like the layout of the club. Both pools were to the side of the stage, making it hard for you to watch the DJ from where u were. Oh and don't even get me started about the pool water!  Let's just say by the time Kaskade came out the water was a murky. Don't even want to know what happened... . Staff: Everyone that I encountered and asked help from were nice and polite which was a nice change!. . BEWARE of thieves!! Please don't cheap out on getting a locker! During my time there, a lot of girls around me lost their stuff. Steve Madden wedges, sunglasses, sandals and cell phones just to name a few.. . Overall, I am happy with my experience here!. . Giving this place a TWO thumbs up, definitely worth checking out this summer season.
Went there for my brothers 21st birthday but was a fail once we got there due to the bouncer rejecting our entrance to the fact that we had about 7 males and 3 females (their ratio is 1:1 males:females for entrance) when unfairly he let a group of 4 males in with no question. That logic makes no sense. . . Very rude and disrespectful. Have been there a couple of times before but that night was disturbingly unpleasant. No wonder they're getting a bad rep nowadays. . . Hakkasan or the clubs at the encore were our other choices such as XS and Surrender and are 10x better.
I was able to go to both Marquee Nightclub and Dayclub and besides it being somewhat of a blur it was fun. I was more of a fan of the day club than the night club so to sum this review up I am just going to list the Pros and Cons of each.. . Nightclub Pros:. *Great DJs. *Great Sound system. *Great looking ladies. . Nightclub Cons:. *Expensive!. *If you want to actually not wait in line be prepaired to cough up some cash to bypass the line.. *Trying to get a drink is kind of ridiculous . *This place only caters to the rich and to the females. *Packed beyond belief where you honestly cant move or go anywhere. *Disorganized. *Way to hot!. *No where to sit unless you buy a VIP table. . Dayclub Pros:. *Way more laid back than the night club. *Great DJs . *Amazing looking people. . Dayclub Cons:. *The journey just to get to this place is kind of nuts. *Expensive. *Bouncers are pricks
Great Club! I was brought here by the promoter Brian T who is an outstanding promoter! Porter Robinson was playing so the place was packed. My friends enjoyed the fact that they had a hip hop room as well. The outside pool area was nice to lounge in although the winds were a little high that night. If you need to ger on the guest list, text Brian T 408.896.5160. He's the best promoter I've had the pleasure to work with in Vegas!
C'mon, an easy win in a crowded Vegas club scene. I am not by any means a vivid clubgoer, but when I go I demand to be taken care of and damn does the Marquee do a good job. If you can avoid the crowd - table/bouncer/promoter - do what you gotta do to make it happen because the Marquee is consistently dope if you don't need to deal with the hassle.
Got in on GL, no cover, all good. Staff was kinda rude. Top floor and Hip Hop rooms were closed so only the main floor was open (Monday Night). Sat in the corner of the patio while we waited for the place to fill up and were told we couldn't sit. Lame...there was NO one in the outside tables. Bartender was a snot so I said F-this..XS is a 5 min cab...bye. I could see a possible good time here but I wouldn't pick it over Drais or XS or even Surrender. The staff should check out Drais and learn how it's done.
Unce unce unce unce!. . I feel like a lot of my reviews start with "unce unce unce" hahaha. Can't get enough of that edm! Anywayyys, I had me & my bf on the GL so we were both able to get in for FREE..... to see DASH BERLIN !!!!!! :D AMAZING! We had to get in before 11pm to make the cut off time. So we started lining up around 10:30 and they gave us our ticket right away. I was also able to get a wristband for open bar ... but it ended at 11pm :( and I didn't make it on time. Oh wells! Drinks are pretty pricey, but I guess it's average in vegas? I got a redbull vodka, which was $18 + $2 tip = $20 total for that damn drink! Plus, it wasn't even that strong :( Bleh. Buuuuttt, I did talk to some guy & he gave me a ticket for a free drink but it only limits to 1 to 1 ratio of juice and alcohol. But still good, FREE drink!!! :). . The dance floor is kinda small but it's better than hakkasan. I love that Marquee had the outdoor& indoor stage and a pool outside! When I went on Monday, it was SUPER windy ... so hopefully people going to EDC the weekend after will be okay and EDC won't be cancelled like it did 2 years ago haha. There was also a sitting area outside as well, right next to the bar, pretty sweet! My bf's knees were hurting really bad so thankfully they had a place to sit and not having us get tables. Performance was AMAZING! They had dancers on the side and even a guy throwing the crowd some glowsticks and wristbands.. . Overall, I had an amazing time at Marquee and I would definitely go back again!
You have to be or look like the bouncer to get in here. Five guys before me got in with wife beater tank tops and baseball caps but I couldn't get in with a tank top.. . Bought the clothes next door to get in and then the girls bar tending couldn't take an order in spite of being empty.. . I'd go somewhere else where there aren't jabronies
Nice club, good music, only downside: stairs. So many stairs. You can have a complete workout and not even have to hit the gym the next day.
I went on an impromptu trip to Vegas with a friend and her sister, and via suggestions from her friends, we came here on a Friday night - when Benny Benassi (known for his song 'Satisfaction') was the DJ. A lotta bachelor party people were out this night. Music was groove-worthy and different from just the top hits but it was techno-ish and not my ultimate preference; but still, it was all right to dance to. Female dancers in their typical get-ups were scattered in niches across various walls and about 4 dancers were on stage-most had decent bodies and normal lookin' faces. Place was packed. Once indoors, a nice, tall, broad-shouldered gentlemen split the seas of people and kindly escorted us to the restroom. A bartender we encountered was cold - bad night?, hating dealing w/ alcohol-induced people, perhaps?  . . We waited in the 'other hotel guests' line to get in. Terrible. The bouncer, too, gave us an attitude way below chilly. Waited an hour, from midnight to 1am. While the night was fun, I don't think it was worth the wait. Waiting to get in is just boring, and it was a $20 cover charge. It is a spacious place, though, with a spacious interior connecting to the outdoor area. It seems the way to get in quickly into packed night clubs in Vegas is to know or make acquaintances with a club promoter, which is how we got into Club XS on Saturday night. It is the promoters' job to promote their clubs or whatever they are promoting, and this way you can help avoid a needless, tedious wait.
As a guest of the Cosmopolitan, I visited the pool during the day which is A-OK. Of the 3 pools at the Cosmo, Marquee is THE party pool, so if you want quiet chill time this locale is probably not for you. . . I had perhaps a bit of an atypical experience when visiting the "Nightclub." The first part of the night I was attending a private party that had open bar and was fully catered. Great cocktails! The bartenders are obviously well-skilled and know how to poor a mean drink.  . . I don't know what kitchen prepares the food, but I have to say I had the very best ever ribeye I've everhad in my life! Directly from the carving board (poor guy did not know how to cut meat, but didn't matter) to my plate to my mouth. A whole ribeye slow roasted for 15 hours served from a poolside buffet - who would've thunk it? :) The JUMBO coconut shrimp were also a huge hit! The staff couldn't keep the trays full.  . . Having already been inside decided to check out the inside club (no line, no cover - yay!). Super crowded, loud DJ, house music, I'm finally too old for that scene - or at least too old to not enjoy being pushed around and have drinks spilled on me anymore, so we only stayed for one - plus we had another private event at another Casino to attend. . . If you're young and hip (not hip replacement), rumor is Marquee is THE hot club on The Strip right now - so party on boys and girls!
I was there on the 13th of this month, first time being there since I'm not a big EDM fan and it was pretty legit. Had a real good table right above the dance floor. I would come again.
I did not have a good experience at Marquee. I went on a Monday where drinks were supposedly free for females from 10p-11p. That was a lie, the bartender was super rude and said that it didn't apply to hard liquor. Maybe it should have been advertised that it was only beer or something and not "free drinks". The place was jammed packed too - it seemed like they were way over capacity. . . My friends and I decided to go to the dancefloor..worst decision ever. In the span of the 5 minutes that we were there, my friend was touched inappropriately and my phone was stolen right out of my purse. When we went to the security to report it, they never did anything. They were rude, was not helpful at all, and all they said was to come back the next day to look thru the lost and found. They didnt even try to help us report it to the police. We left right away and took the cab to the police station ourselves. . . I knew my phone wouldn't show up in lost and found but we still went back the next day in the hopes that maybe it had turned up. The girl that was in the lost and found booth was rude and had no customer service. There was music playing loud in the lobby and she was sitting all the in the back of the booth, expecting us to hear her. She never came up to speak with her until we told her that we couldn't hear her, and only then did she get up to look thru the lost and found file. . . Overall, the people at Marquee needs to learn what customer service means. I will never come back to Marquee after their horrible service.
This review is for the nightclub portion of Marquee. It pays to be on the guest list at Marquee as we were not in line for very long. We were whisked away via a back entrance route to the club. Ladies, this entails a very brutal walk up the stairs as evidenced by my lady friends. The ladies with the large heels have to work for a wonderful clubbing experience. The club consisted of two sections. They were playing hip hop outside while playing EDM inside. The thing that was most noticeable were the translucent hot tubs adjacent to the cabanas. It seems like those tubs would be used during the day time. I was mainly outside listening to the hip hop music but the EDM music was also pretty good as well. Also, if I remember correctly, mixed drinks were about $16 a drink.....so definitely try to pre-drink before you come to the club.. . Marquee provides you the ability to purchase your tickets in advance before going to the club. For the world renowned DJ's that they bring into the venue, it is advisable to do so. Also, Marquee has all access wristbands that are good for an entire weekend. One weekend I saw had the price point for an all weekend wristband was $100 for males and $30 for females. I suppose that if you were a guy who really wanted multiple opportunities to hookup with girls, the wristband may be worth it. Who knows....... . The music definitely stole the show. I would love to return to Marquee in the near future.
Second time to this club in 2 years. Didn't like it the first time and it wasn't any better the second time around. The music inside the club wasn't any good. The music outside was a lot better but it was too hot to handle.
