This was an awful experience. I have been in the service industry for 8 years. The service was terrible (the kind where you want to order 3 drinks at once because you see your server so infrequently), the food was not good. We were there with 7 other people and not one of us had an enjoyable item from the menu. Glad I was there with great people because there were NO other positive things I could add.
Really great for brunch! I enjoyed the starter with self made strawberry starter which just tasted like my Mom would make it. :). . The Omlette was good but not outstanding. I really loved the Passionfruit Sorbet though.
Not sure what was worse, the service or the food. I should have paid more attention to the 'bad' reviews before making a reservation here, because many of them rang true for our dinner as well. As another reviewer accurately stated, Mr. Keller should be embarrassed to have his name on this place. We had the gran plateau, escargot, charcuterie plate, sea bass, mussels, and gnocchi. NOTHING deserved more than 2 stars.. . There wasn't one person at our table of 8 that enjoyed our dinner. Gnocchi was just flat out terrible. Should have ordered 3 drinks to start with because we didn't see our server for at least two 30 minute stretches.. . If I could rate the service less than a 1 star I would. 2 hour dinners are fine if you are being waited on, but the person who we were unfortunate enough to have never even checked to see how our food was! She also proceeded to 'tell' me when I would be 'allowed' to order a drink - when it was convenient for her - what a joke. I was a server for 8 years, and appreciate when restaurants are busy - but there were empty tables everywhere. No excuses here.. . Bottom line... Think twice before wasting your money, but even more so - your time - at this restaurant.
Awesome vibe. We hit Bouchon for brunch and their menu was fantastic and there was literally something for everyone. . . The place was crowded for a Sunday morning, but even with the amount of people, I still felt like we had room. It is spacious and overlooking a beautiful outdoor patio area. We sat inside because it was mega hot out, but everyone outside seemed just as satisfied!. . The service was great. Our waitress accommodated every request. Even though they were out of their blackberry jam, she brought us every other jam they had available! . . The presentation of the food and quality is definitely something to brag about. It may just be my new favorite brunch spot!. . I honestly cannot think of anything bad! Even getting to the restaurant from valet was convienent.
Amazing place.  We sat out on the terrace which was perfect.  Their froie gras is to die for.  I ordered the sea bass which did not disappoint.
Foie gras is a must have. It's so good and so legal. Beef tartar came in a relatively big portion of an appetizer that the amount of raw meet could be shared by 3 people without jeopardizing anybody's health. . . Service wasn't bad but wasn't quite welcoming.
My boyfriend and I stop in about once a month. We always sit at the bar and Mark helps us. He is such a gem and we always have a great time and an amazing meal!! This is definitely our go-to spot!
I'm pretty much a regular at Bouchon in Beverly Hills.  The Bouchon in Beverly Hills is 5 star because:  Their cocktails are off the charts, service is awesome (they are always nice to me) and the classic items on their menu are consistently amazing.. . On Wednesday I opt for their location in The Venetian Hotel. Quickly realize the menu is the same and I feel at home.  Start my meal with a corpse reviver which is their best cocktail in Beverly Hills.  Immediately realize I am not in LA as the drink here is sloppy and not the same.  Details are not worth getting into.  Had a second drink and it is obvious this location does not get cocktails.. . The escargots in puff pastry appetizer is precise to Beverly Hills.  It is incredible and worth the $17 (every penny).  . . The mussels were the problem.  In Beverly Hills the brothis incredible and rivals the best bistro style mussels in this town.  In Las Vegas the mussels are not the same.  The sauce is too thick, too salty and needs more wine.   It is not the same fabulous dish I crave in Beverly Hills.. . Service at this location needs some work.  Service in Beverly Hills is amazing.  While in Las Vegas it is fair.. . Will I eat here again?  No.  I will eat in the French Laundry and other Bouchon locations.  But I won't go through this again.  No excuse for Bouchon to go downhill just because they are in Las Vegas.
The service at this restaurant is impeccable. From our wonderful server Julie ( asked to be seated in her area, she's very knowledgeable of the menu and the food preparation) to even the guy that brings the amazing bread! We had an amazing time, amazing food and drinks! We had the fried pig ears and the salmon rillettes as starters and I finished with the truffle pasta and the berry pavlova for dessert. A must, if you are a jack Daniels whiskey drinker, is to try the very unique bottle of the JD Sinatra edition whiskey, pricey at $40 a drink but insanely good!!
The food isn't "bad" but it doesn't justify the prices they charge for it. . Quality is typical of a mid range bistro and prices are like somewhere much fancier. . . We had a croque Madame which was dry and bland, a desert that was dry and bland, and a lamb thing that was "kind of okay" but more what you'd expect for half the price.
Great decor and experience at the bouchon each time I've been here .... . . Great for brunch which is why most people go here but also great for dinner . . Croque madame is amazing for brunch . . For dinner.... . - sea bass was good except the sauce was slight on the salter side . -the chicken was super tender and the sauce complimented well. -the lamb was pretty good and amazing ! Texture was just perfect . -foie Gras in a jar was good it was tasty and paired well with the slight salt .... but I actually really liked it with jam it off setted some of the saltiness. . Awesome service !. Aaron Pana manager and our server Danny surprised our bride to be with a a box of macaroons .... she really wanted them so the manager walked over to the bakery and got some macaroons it was amazing with our coffee
Excellent cocktails, good food, so-so service.  Closes pretty early.
This is by far my husband and my favorite restaurant on the strip and in Vegas in general since we moved here back in September. We have only been there for breakfast but it is amazing every single time so we can't help but find ourselves going back. . . Everything that you are served is fantastic which I find is rare when it comes to restaurants. From the bread and homemade jam to start your meal to the fresh squeezed juices and homemade pastries to the sourdough french toast or fresh omelets - we never go home hungry or unhappy. Whenever we have visitors in town we are sure to take them to Bouchon for breakfast.
I've been to Bouchon in Napa several times, and that place is outstanding. I'm a big fan of Thomas Keller, but I think he needs to make a visit to make some quality control here. The mussels had about a pound of saffron in the juice. I had my sister taste them and she couldn't believe how weird they tasted. The $20 cobb salad tasted ok but was very small. We ordered a $20 grilled tuna sandwich of the day, which was a tuna salad sandwich with cheap chunk light tuna and cheap olives thrown on top. The tomato soup was bland and tasted like it was from a can. The fries were great though. At $75 for a light lunch for two, we felt ripped off, and we were. Really disappointed, but it's yet another example of what happens when the chef/creator isn't there for quality control.
I would highly recommend NOT visiting this restaurant. Our sea food appetizer was not fresh, our drinks were not refilled and we waited 3 hours to receive our entrees which were heavily salted. Bad service and bad food.
Excellent brunch a la francaise! We had fresh delicious oysters & clams! My Croque Madame was fantastic with enough fries ( true pomme frites!) to share. We also enjoyed a fabulous salad with goat cheese. Ambience perfection. Waiter excellent. We left with a baguette under our arm!!
Came for brunch and so glad I did! . . FOOD:. Fresh Orange Juice (5 stars): Definitely fresh. They have good oranges (= haha. . . Mocha Coffee (4 stars): I'm not a big coffee fan so I just tried this, but it was good. . . Croque Madame (4 stars): This probably would have been 5 stars if my yolk was really runny. It was cooked too long so the bottom of the yolk was done and not much yolk oozed out when popper )= I was so hungry so I just started digging in anyway. Still a great sandwich! The sauce, egg, bread, cheese, ham, everything is perfect together. Got it with french fries which were nice and crispy! I'll have to come back to get this and specify a runny egg.. . French Toast (5 stars): SO GOOD! It's like a bread pudding french toast, not too sweet, just right. The apple and cinnamon go with it so well and it comes with a couple pieces of bananas to balance the sweetness. . . ATMOSPHERE (5 stars). Sit on the patio if you have a chance, it's small but makes the experience so much better. We got to sit right next to the fountain outside. They have umbrellas up so you don't need to worry about getting too hot.. . SERVICE (5 starts). Our waiter was...well, a little socially awkward at times, haha, but the service was still good. Waters were always filled and he kept checking on us. Only thing is I forgot to ask for bread, which I thought would just come out anyway. All the reviews rave about it so I probably missed out =/
This place was awesome! We came here first thing right when we got I to vegas for some breakfast. The service was amazing our waiter was so nice and was very knowledgable about the menu and everything that went into the dishesbeing prepared. Our friend who had just graduated cooking school had mentioned so and our waiter hooked it up and got him a meet and greet with the chef and kitchen walk through. The food was amazing, homemade, and so fresh. The hospitality was incredible most impressive place in vegas.
My husband and I have been here several times. It's a Saturday morning brunch must when we hit Vegas. We have only really a a problem with service once, which was a few times ago. The waitress was short and snappy with my mother-in-law and myself. She wouldn't let us be when we were getting our payment ready to take care of the check.. . That's the only bad, ever.. . Now for the good! . . Every other time we have ever come, the service is phenomenal all across the board! You are greeted by two host/hostesses and cheerfully seated. You almost immediately have your drink order taken by a busier or server and a fresh baguette and butter brought to your table.  The servers are always very informative on the daily specials and eager to share their tips and opinions.. . Saturday, you've gotta order the chicken and waffles. The chicken, be sure to use the gravy. Trust me, my goodness! Amazing!. . There really isn't anything not good on the menu. The only think I haven't liked is the French Toast. And that's only because it's not a typical Americanized style meal.... Which makes sense since this is not Americanized or American style food. Lot wasn't bad, I just didn't like it, personally. . . The management has always been very courteous and over the top helpful as well. Both the managers have given us their cards and told us to let them know when we come in. We've been greeted by the managers upon entrance multiple times, not having to wait at all for a table. We've been brought complimentary pastry baskets and mimosas. We've had some of our check shaved off, just because.. . This is not your typical Vegas hangover spot. It's a great place with amazing service and fantastic, exceptional quality food prepared by a very talented kitchen staff.. . Oh, and the bartenders serve absinthe. They serve it the way it should be served.. . Go, enjoy this little gem of a spot!
My first stop when I arrive in Vegas !!!!. . This is my go to place for brunch and breakfast . The food here is amazing . If you like chicken and waffles the roasted chicken with bacon chive waffle and Tahitian vanilla bean butter is out of this world . The chef here knows his stuff , food is 100 consistent and delicious .. . The management is is the most dedicated I know of in any place . They go above and beyond to make sure you have an experience instead of just a bite to eat, Huguette was so good to us and made each dinning experience an awesome one . We are in Vegas 8-10 times a year and I look forward to my trips knowing I get to stop in and stuff my self with all these delicious choices .
Chicken and waffle.  One of the best meal to be had in Vegas.  The waffle is light and crispy with bacon bits.  Top it off with vanilla bean butter and a light maple syrup and its become even better.  The chicken in roasted and comes with a pancetta gravy. Another example why bacon is good with anything or is it everything.
Bouchon is apparently the best breakfast place on the strip.  I somewhat agree but breakfast is just breakfast.  How great can eggs & bacon get?  So why the 4 stars? Please keep going. . . The restaurant is located on the 10th floor of Venetian.   It's pretty easy to find because there are security guards scattered all around in the hallways on the way in.  The outdoor dining area was closed because it was summer and too hot.  It was beautiful though - with fountains and all.  You can see people swimming further back in the outdoor area as well. . . I had the eggs, bacon, potato croquette, and toast.   The toast is amazing.  Perfectly toasted all around.  I'm sure you're asking "how good can TOAST be?"  Just try it.. You'll know what I mean.  The bacon was nice and crispy.  The eggs were okay (1 poached and 1 scrambled).  Potato croquette is def. worth the try! Crispy on the outside and super creamy on the inside.  The BF loved it. $13. . I also had the French Toast with my breakfast.... It is definitely NOT your typical French Toast.  It tasted more like a big bread pudding topped with caramelized apples, bananas, & powdered sugar.  It was way too sweet for the BF but I loved it.  I wish it had more of a pastry texture though.... Kinda tasted TOO much like just pudding - which ended up feeling way too heavy.  There was no way we could finish it.. $13. . The BF had the corned beef hash and eggs.  The corned beef wasn't grounded and were cut into cubes. The beef was slightly tough too.. I think cause of the way they were cut up.  I liked it overall but I wish it came with more hash potatoes.  He wasn't too impressed.. But I'm sure he was being picky cause he expected it to be perfect.  $18
So I'm in Vegas for a friend's bachelor's party, Hangover-style, but with more foodies. Outside of our primary goal of giving our friend-soon-to-be-groom one final night on the town before settling down, our secondary goal was simple: find good, non-buffet food on the strip. After some searching and much delineation, we decided that Bouchon looked like the safest choice for a decent meal. We entered the lavishly decorated restaurant with large expectations and appetites.. . Perusing the menu, I was torn between getting French Toast (my all-time favorite) and something savory. Although the description of the French Toast (with caramelized apples, maple syrup, and bananas) seemed pretty decadent, my concerns were assuaged by the fact that they are a bakery in addition to being a restaurant, so I ended up splitting the French Toast and the heftily priced Chicken & Waffles with a friend.. . Well, that was a mistake. The French Toast came out as a single tiny pillar plopped onto the dish. Surprisingly, it included very little bread, and instead was supplemented by layers of candied apple slices, mortared with custard, and drowned in syrup. Way too sweet, and almost no bounce from the brioche bread; in short, completely unbalanced. Why this wasn't on the dessert menu was beyond me. At least I split it with the Chicken & Waffles, right?. . Wait, what? A paltry 1/4 chicken, and 4 meager waffle slices? For $26? The meat was scant and not even that good, and the waffles--and I don't use this description lightly--tasted more like air than anything else. Sure there was a slight waft from the chives and bacon, but nothing potent enough to make you forget how little substance the waffles really had.. . We also ordered a few sides of bacon for the table, but the stripes were soggy and not very flavorful. We didn't finish them.. . I ended up paying nearly $40 for breakfast for sub-par food and wasn't even full.. Conclusion: Offensively overpriced.. . Conversely, service was exceedingly good, almost as if our waiter was attempting to make up for the fact that it was overpriced with his pleasantness, but there was no digging out of this hole. Do not be swayed by the inexplicably numerous good reviews for this place. Avoid.. . Looks like my quest to find decent food on the strip continues.
