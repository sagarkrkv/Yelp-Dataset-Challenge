I've eaten pho all over the country, and I have to say this is my top spot!! I have never had service so amazing, with a super sexy vibe. Everything we had was fantastic...let's not forget to mention its 24/7!!! If you need a cheap late night drunk food spot...I promise this is it.
Absolutely wonderful. We came here late night on a Sunday. There was a steady flow of people coming in. Our sever Johnathan was very helpful and fast. I loved the atmosphere. My standards of Pho has risen because of this place. I've never had such delightful and tasty soup.  I order the egg noodle won ton soup. My boyfriend had the #13 Pho. No complaints here, we just wish we had big stomachs. This is a 24 hour place to dine. Food came out super quick.
We placed a to go order and they left out one of entrees.  Once we realized when we were home and called them, they said there's nothing they can do.  No refund, nothing.  Very shady.
Best Pho I have had in my life! This place is so good its popular. They even have  a sign in sheet. That tells you something!!
I love coming here with friends after having a night out! Great service and great food!!
Place is very busy but well worth the wait. People in town say it's the best pho place to eat. My food has been amazing both times I have been there this week. Our server didn't listen to my order and when I told her it was wrong but I ate it she didn't care lol. I will still go back because it's that good.
Used to be my favorite, but not anymore. Don't know if my taste buds changed or if the food quality changed. I usually order the same thing everytime I come here, but everything tasted alittle different. I always order the calamari, vermicelli noodles and side of pho. 30 min wait to one hour is a norm here. Don't think it's worth it anymore
The food was exceptional. I enjoyed the broth. Nothing much to rave about. The cilantro and lime was a lot less than other pho places normally give. The ambiance is really nice and comfortable.. . What ruins this is the service. There was absolutely no attention paid to us. Over half the time I was there I had no water. I tried getting the attention of three different workers and was ignored. When two busboys were bussing the table besides us I asked one of them if we could have more water. He barely looked at me and said hold on with his index finger up. That whole time afterwards I was watching him and there were times he had nothing to do and still didn't refill our drinks. Even after making eye contact with him multiple times he still didn't come. That's when I decided to just leave. Just ridiculous. Something as simple as refilling a water was ignored.
Wow this restaurant is open 24 hrs! I currently reside in Prov RI, was on vacation in Vegas and was getting up at 8a and was craving for pho ( noodle soup), found this place on the Internet, and there pho is absolutely delicious and i was served right a way!! Deff will go here again when in Vegas!!!
One of my favorite places to eat after a long night of partying or if I just want some good authentic Vietnamese food. Fast cab ride from the strip and easy to call for a can back. Prices are pretty reasonable!
I have dined her 2 times. I always give most restaurants a few chances. The first time My experience was good. I enjoyed the Pho very much as well as the spring rolls. . BUT today I was highly disappointed. I ordered the Wor Won ton soup and it was lacking a whole lot. No flavor to my broth what so ever. The pork egg rolls were warm, not hot. seemed like they were sitting for a bit before being served to our table. . . On a good note we were seated immediately upon arrival during the Lunch Rush Hour. Our waitress was fast, and friendly, She even fixed our bill for us as there was an error and we were charged for something we did not order. . The Pho my brother Ordered was full of flavor. . . My suggestion is DO NOT ORDER the wor won ton soup. Stick with the PHO!
I used to hate this place. I can't get myself to eat pho at a Restaurant when we make it at home.. . The first time I went the service was so horrible that I do to even remember the food.. . Today I went for lunch with my friends and reluctantly got #13.. It was really good today. The serving was generous and it came out quickly. I know that can be a bad thing but it was a good thing today since we were hungry. The amount of meat for the price was good also. The broth was good and they have us a generous amount of herbs and sprouts.. . We got two appetizers the crab rangoons and the egg rolls. They were both good but nothing special.. . I took the time out to write this quick review because the service was so good today.. . Usually the staff is pretty short and rude.. . Today they were attentive, polite, and efficient. We had like 4 people help us.. . It seems with the increased business they're getting they took the time to improve the service.. . I was just really pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.. . I've had their drunken noodles which is a Thai dish that they actually do a really good version of.. . They have good food for sure so if you were reluctant to eat here because of bad service I'd say to give them another chance.
One night after a gig... Some friends took me to Pho Kim Long (no pun intended), although I've heard many good things about the place I was ready to see for myself... We arrived a little after 2am on a Wednesday night, there was a line and I didn't mind. I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.. . So for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!. . For entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while! I wasn't full although I was indeed satisfied. This is a nice place to go after a night of clubbing or even for a date. I will definitely be back again!
i came from san jose and i hear this place so good and i stop to fine out but supprire for me. very terrible for service take the long time for waiting list. the employees very discourteous. And the food is so bad.Price so expensive. nothing to remember this restaurant in my life.
Food is good, always a wait even at 3am. Service is pretty friendly for being a place that busy. The only thing so far we don't like about this place is the calamari, it is to damn oily.
I cannot believe this place has such high ratings, a line AND a recommendation from my taxi driver. Maybe the rating is purely because of the entertaining nature of it's name.. . I was getting my bracelet restrung at the World of Feng Shui during a trip to Vegas and got hungry.  I was by myself and thought, hmmm, let's get some Vietnamese since I'm right in the middle of Chinatown.....?. . Long story short.  I waited for 15 minutes.  They forgot to bring my 3 color bean drink (the very first thing I ordered).  The pho was average.  I asked for just tendons in my pho.  I love tendons.  There might have been 3 pieces floating or buried under my noodles.  The eggrolls were greasy and very small.  . . Maybe I'm just used to Westminster, CA or Little Saigon as it's known as.  Or maybe I made the mistake of asking my Lebanese taxi driver where to get good Vietnamese.  Or maybe I just should have stuck with Chinese food in Chinatown......
Been here a few times and as of last weekend, I won't be coming back. The Pho doesn't taste THAT great anymore (or maybe I just have to be drunk to enjoy it) and the service was rude and rushed. .. Would rather pay $20 for a bowl of Pho on the strip.
This is definitely the go-to pho spot post a crazy Vegas night.. . The soup is A-OK - but due to the limited selection, I will definitely recommend this place + Lee's coffee is right next door.. . Please note that they do not have tripe!
I love this place almost everything is good besides the chicken fried noodles it tastes like warm slimey salt water .. I'm not sure if that's normal. The Beijing beef is really good and I'm in love with the egg rolls.
Hands down best broth I've ever had. Ktown  in LA should be ashamed.. . Further more... Young coconut. So good.
Still excellent food with bad service.   But, it's ultimately the food that everyone goes for.  The egg noodle wonton is yummy. The number 1 was not no 1. Pho is flavorful.   So much on the menu and they make them all so well.  The service staff see you as an inconvenience not as a customer,  hmm.  That's the kind of abuse I have to endure to get the privilege of eating their truly delicious food,  so they had me at the hello followed by the curt, how many.  Love the food.  Addicted to it.
Great atmosphere and great food. Seated our group of 15 quite fast and easily. Definitely recommend to all.
Came in sat down promptly and order right away.  10,15,20,25,30min ..where's my food??? Saw about 3 different tables fill up..saw that they too ordered right away so 35, 40min..what do I see?? I see those 3 tables getting their food before me..WT.F!!!45,50min I think..I was too mad at this point or maybe an hour went by until I finally received my food..if the food I ate was any good (beef cube with brown rice) I would've given them 2 stars but it was bland and the portion was really small for $14..overall I don't think I'm ever coming back..what a wack ass experience.
Had high expectations since a lot of my friends raved about it. First off, the service is horrible. Took about 15 mins to get seated when it wasn't even that busy. Took another 15 mins to get our orders taken. Second, My pho dat biet came out super salty, my moms vegan pho the veggies weren't even cooked & salty & my dad's pho came out cold. Won't come back.
First thing first : the receptionist /waiter is cute looking! . . The setting of the place looks nice. At least much better looking than the other ph restaurants around this area.
As most have already mentioned, this good is perfect for hangovers. If you get this sober however, you might be a bit disappointed. . . The perks of Pho Kim Long is that it is 24 hours. The staff is friendly. The food is also cooked and ready within minutes. The best time to come is early afternoon. No wait :)
This gotta be the best pho I have ever had in my life~ If you plan to eat some Vietnamese food in Vegas, this is worth the drive or taxi ride for some nice clean, delicious, non greasy, light food~
Need a hangover cure while in Las Vegas? Well, come here!. . Likes:. -Cheap. . -Definitely good when you are craving something soupy and low-key have a hangover. . -Service is quick. . -Plenty of parking in parking lot. . . Dislikes:. -Notthe friendliest service, but frankly, most Asian restaurants, like this aren't.. -It's not totally convenient since you cannot walk there if you are staying on the Strip, but it is definitely close enough to drive.  . . Recommend:. Yes!
Took about 30 minutes for us to finally order and it took practically another 45-hour for the food which only took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Got our food before our utensils. Long story short: horrendous service.
I love this place!  I have been twice and I get the vegetarian pho.  It is excellent.  It's so fresh and is one of my favorite late night eateries.  It's open 24 hours so you can get your pho fix any time.
We ate here twice during our last stay in Vegas.  It was awesome both times.  The spring rolls were great.  Open 24 hrs and fast service.  We definitely will go back next time we are in town.  The 1st time was at 3am.  The 2nd time was at 11pm.  They were busy both times but the wait to sit was very short.  I had pad thai the 1st time.
I'm from NYC and this place beats ALL of the vietnamese restaurants we have here. . . Atmosphere - ALL asians! Ha! . . Food - Our food came quick. I got the a spicy beef noodle soup. Soup was so sweet and savory. So delicious. My bowl was not fill with oil either. Noodles were cooked to perfection. Spring rolls (they call them summer rolls)/fried egg rolls were so crispy and yummy!
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from a Las Vegas pho joint. I mean.....usually I don't get beyond the Strip, but I was feeling adventurous and I had major comfort food cravings that Earl's couldn't satisfy. This place proved me wrong!. . The wait for 5 the Monday afternoon following EDC weekend was about 20-25 minutes. Not bad considering what a packed weekend it was and the families buzzing around.. . Got the Pho Tai Nam with tai on the side. They confused my order. I ordered a small, I got a large. I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.. . The smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste. . . The decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints. Just don't come in here with high hopes of having a deep conversations -- all the sounds are literally bouncing off the walls. I think it's the "yay I'm cured from my hangover" happiness that reverberates through the walls, but the yummy soup could also the case :).
Great place outside the strip! Open 24 hours a day. Awesome pho. Their chicken wings with the Kim Long sauce is really good too. There's always a crowd waiting but the wait is never more than a few minutes. Highly recommend this spot!
