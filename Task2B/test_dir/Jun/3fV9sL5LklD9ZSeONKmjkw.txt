Mmmmm!  I can still taste that nutella milkshake.  Hands down the best shake I've ever had!  Since hubby and I were staying at the Mirage, we used our free $50 Expedia food voucher to try this place out our first day there.  We liked it soo much, we came back here one other time during our short stay.  Hubby liked the blt burger and I liked the california chicken sandwich.  Totally recommend this place!
This by far is the best burger place I have been to. Shake shack is second. I have been there twice and both times had excellent burgers. The waffle nachos were delicious. I've had the blue burger and the sliders. All great. Excellent service and beer. Would highly recommend.
Was not impressed with my burger at ALL. Very bland and when you're paying 15 dollars for a burger, it better taste amazing. . . My favorite part of the meal was the fries.. . And to top it off the server we had was inattentive and  impatient with our table. I felt more like I was doing him a favor by getting my order done than being cared for by him. . . *sigh* so much potential. So little follow through.
Came here last night & had the worst experience ever! I ordered the bbq wings & fat fries. When my food came out, my wings looked burnt. I ate one and they were horrible. I sent them back & continued to eat my fries. When finished, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen. I asked for a manager and he didn't seem concerned at all but I did feel out a report. I will never go back to this place. I'm not allergic to any foods so I knew it had to be this place. So enter at your own risk!
A high end burger, fries and milkshake joint in a hotel.  I noticed this is the new trend.  The burger was tasty of course.  I liked the fact they had different types of fries (I had the waffle ones).  $22 for a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a coke is excessive.  I don't care if its in the Mirage, the burger was 7oz and the fry size is not large (is a cup).  I spent $60 for two to eat.  It was not worth more than $50.
I was pleasantly surprised to see non beef burgers on the menu.   The salmon burger with water crest was delicious.  The portions ample for sharing.   The downside is that it is inside of the Mirage so you would need to enter the Mirage to eat here.  If you are staying in the hotel, great. I wouldn't enter the hotel just to eat here though.  Service was friendly,  nice booths, but loud.
Great burger. Easy atmosphere.  I had the Gouda burger which is sitting in a pool of melted cheese. Delish. The buffalo fries were awesome. Service was good. I was alone and the waitress was sociable. Burger meat was medium cooked perfectly. Slightly on the salty side. But overall great.. Went back later in our trip for late night fried pickles. Different, but good.
Very bland, I ate a burger that had NO flavor. I have never had to put salt and pepper on a burger but i had to on this burger. Ribs were on of the entrees of the day, they were horrible! It was like eating rubber with cold BBQ sauce
I really didn't have any expectations for this place.  We chose it as it was one of the lower priced pre-fix dinners before our show that evening.  Well, we were all blown away with the food.  Most of us ordered some variation (toppings) of a burger.  The seasoning was amazing, all were cooked to perfection.  Our pre-fix came with a selection of appetizers and desserts.  I tasted the pickles and waffle bites.  The pickles look like they are heavily breaded, but they were surprisingly very light tasting.  The waffle bites were just as yummy, full of flavor.  We were all so stuffed, we couldn't imagine our desserts, but we ate as much as we could muster as they were also amazing. Most everyone at the table had a shake, I had the brownie bite sundae (fabulous) and another person at our table had the pie of the day (banana cream), which she didn't really care for, but she did like the flambeed bananas on the side.  We all left with overly stuffed bellies and totally satisfied with our meal.
I have been here a bunch of times and each time the service is great and the food/drinks are even better. My last time in Vegas I went twice and my only complaint is that it is a little steep, but I wouldn't expect anything different for a place in Vegas.. . This time while eatingthere I decided to be a little different and get the California Chicken and it was so good that I got it the second time I went there. One of the best parts of eating here are the adult milkshakes! I got the Fuzzy the Bear and Malibu Barbie, which were two different choices for me as well (I usually get the All-Nighter, which is awesome) but they were both delicious and will definitely find their way into my rotation.. . This place will definitely remind on my must stop at while I'm in Vegas!. . Oh yeah and I almost forgot I love their pickles. I cannot find another pickle like theirs anywhere and I just want to buy a jar and bring it back home!
Go to Keller's Burger place  - better meat, better sides and much better managed.. . While tables sit empty, they keep a nice line in front for no apparent reason.. . Got orders wrong, then told me it was my fault.  Then redelivered my burger without pickle on side and cut in half.  Have you ever tried to eat a large burger with your hands when the kitchen cut it in half?  Either a mess or a knife and fork.. . The meat tasted a bit mealy and the pickle (I tried my Wife's) was among the worst I've had.. . Unless you're at a local convention and have no other place to go, don't go here for the food.
It was late afternoon, and we were hungry, so we decided to eat at BLT since it was in the hotel we were staying at (Mirage).. . Maybe because of the time of day we went, but it wasn't busy at all, so our party of four people got seated right away.. . The menu is just the right size, with enough options to keep it interesting, yetnot an overwhelming amount to have to study and narrow down to just one choice.. . Burgers, sandwiches, apps, sides, shakes, floats, beers, etc.. . We ordered a pitcher of Hoegaarden, which came out to about a beer and a half for the four of us. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress' beer pouring. She began pouring the first glass with one hand. Everyone knows you need BOTH hands to pour beer - you need to tilt the glass and pour it on the side so that the head isn't ridiculously large. She didn't do that, so while she was moving on to pour the second glass, the first one began overflowing and got everywhere. She laughed, apologized lightly, and wiped it up. My friend jokingly said that we should get a free beer for that, but either she didn't hear or didn't care to respond. Either way, beer was wasted and we didn't get compensated for her mistake.. . Anyway, moving on to the food.... . I decided to get the ahi tuna spring roll but they were out of that (another disappointment), so I ordered the California Chicken on wheat instead of a sesame seed bun. The food came quickly and looked appetizing. The portions are reasonably large, but they should be for the amount you're paying. The California Chicken tasted alright.. a little too heavy on the avocado.
We stopped in here for lunch after visiting the dolphins, lions, and tigers in the Secret Garden. Our meals were out of this world delicious. DMD had a BBQ bacon cheese burger that was cooked just right and tasted amazing. I had the turkey burger. This was epic!!!! It's hard to make turkey burger but this place has mastered it!!!! It was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The atmosphere was eye appealing also. I liked the wood ceiling and walls. They were a bit pricey but well worth it!!
I think the quality has gone down at this place. We've been several times before and probably won't be back.  The burger was really bland and over priced.  A basic burger with bacon and cheese was $15. Fries cost extra.  For $15 you can't include the fries?!? To add insult to injury, if you order fries and a soda it's supposed to be $7 extra according to the menu but they split the soda from the fries on the bill and charged $7.50 extra. I know it's only 50 cents so I didn't complain but it's things like this that make me wonder what else they are being dishonest about.  I was so disappointed with the food that I didn't even bother ordering my favorite shake... Which was the whole reason of going here in the first place. I really hope they read this review and make some changes.
Not impressed at all, even after all the hype. For being a gourmet burger restaurant on the heart of the strip of Las Vegas in the Mirage, this place does not measure up to par. However the fault and the experience was not diminished by the whole staff. Personally the only thing that was outstanding and really is the glue holding this place together is the wait staff. So humble, so attentive to your every need, not once did I have to ask for a refill. They where always there like Eve was to Adam. Thank you wait staff at the BLT Burger.. . Now the food was another story. See when a place like this is grinding their own meat, its something special. I decided to go with the Highway 80 burger and I told the nice waitress I wanted it cooked medium, she nicely replied that itll be pink in the middle and I nodded in reply to show that I comprehend.  Excited to have a 15 dollar burger that might be worth every penny, I  recieve a well done burger. Now what kind of chef, wait no wrong title, I meant to say cook, overcooks ground beef? Cmon man. Is it that BLT burger has gotten into the habit of what every franchise/company does by hiring desperate underpayed, unexperience and unmotivated cooks who cant even cook meat to its appropriate temperature and serve fries that have been sitting around and where stale and cold.. . Please dont make the same mistake I did. This place is over priced and is just meeting their quaterly profits by pure hype. . . Dont try this place and thank me later.
Watched a show at the Mirage and afterwards came here to eat. They had excellent sliders, fries, and buffalo wings. I would have ate more if I hadn't drank so much! The grade of meat they use here is excellent and service was very good. Would recommend you try this place out if you want a good tasting hamburger. They even have wagyu burgers!
