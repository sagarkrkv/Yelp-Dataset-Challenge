Love, love, love this club! The music and atmosphere did not disappoint. Ty for playing hip hop!!!!! Went in November with my girls & we had an amazing time.. . Another good thing is it's so close to XS that you could club hop and enjoy both.. . Can't wait to go back!
Went there for the first time a few weeks ago and I was impressed. Club is a older compared to the other places, but this is the place to be on Thursday and if you're into mixed music where they play hip hop and not just EDM, then this is the place.
So I went to Tryst for the first time last night.  I was on the guest list and the whole process was pretty painless.  I have to say that I really like the layout.  The club was crowded but you never seemed boxed in anywhere or felt like you didn't have any room.  There was always room to dance and there was ample room to make rounds.  I do wish there was more of a place to just hangout if you are finishing a drink if you didn't have a table.  But they might just do that so you can buy a table, but at Marquee they have that so I will hold it against them.  The music selection was great for a little bit, then they changed the DJ.  The second DJ wasn't nearly as talented with his transitions or cuts and it sounded like he just turned on pandora or was playing an iTunes playlist.  It wouldn't be that big of a deal, but with so many other DJs in Vegas at clubs "next door" it kind of makes you second guess the decision.  Hopefully it's not a common occurrence here.  All in all it was a good time.  It was a great layout and the club is easy to walk into after you valet your car.  The Wynn is a beautiful hotel and it extends to their second tier club so you don't feel like you're in a second tier place.  I would definitely recommend this club to anyone in the Vegas area.  I would just say check the DJ before you go.
As far as Vegas clubs go, the layout of this one is pretty nice. The waterfall is neat, multiple bars make getting a drink pretty easy, and if you want a sweet VIP booth, you're in luck - they feature prominently in this club and look pretty comfortable. . . Not that I was in one. I was over in the crevice where two walls met, hiding from the shoe-Nazi bouncer while quickly rubbing my tired feet (bouncers shine a flashlight on girls to make sure they're wearing shoes). Too damn old for this shit. . . Weekend music was all EDM crap spun by multiple untalented DJ's. He'd fade in the intro of a song everyone loves "Ooooh booiii 99 Problems, this is my jaaam!" and then spin it into some completely different shitty non-song..."Uhhh...just keep dancing, maybe it'll loop back around!" It never did.. . $$$ drinks are served in plastic glasses - mine had a crack in it that let 1/3 of my drink leak out. After waiting for the bartendress to notice me again, she dumped what remained into another glass. Vegas, bitches!. . $30 cover for guys, $20 for girls. Our bouncer offered us the *amazing* deal of 5 people for $120 - that is, $10 less than it would have been anyway. -__-. . Bf and I lasted for about 1.5 hours, which is actually really great for me in a club. The high cover charge for chicks meant that it was a full-blown sausage fest on the dance floor, and I had a pretty amazing time watching bros try to wriggle themselves into bachelorette parties that had bottle service. . . 3 stars for an entertaining time, being cheaper than other mistakes I could have made that night, and for looking so dang classy. Short of the guest list, though, I probably won't make the drive out here again.
