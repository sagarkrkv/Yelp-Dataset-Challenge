Shrip, crab, steak, cheese, cake what more could a girl ask for. We were looking for a vegas buffet and we definitely found it here. The chicken was a little dry and some of the meat was okay.  But over all very good. The best buffet I have ever had and I felt like I was going to a tea party!
Really great choice of food and I am sure that every taste is covered. If you get a chance try the buttermilk pancakes. . Only 3 stars because of really slow and poor service.
I went there for dinner with my parents. I think i should only speak for Chinese that this buffet is horrible! Crab legs and shrimp were both cold. There is no hotsoup. Chinese food section only got three dishes (not good at all, worse than normal chinese take out place). In the Japanese section, only three kinds of sushi rolls were available. No sashimi! Other selection of food was very limited too. After walking around for 5 minutes, three of us came back to our seats with empty plates. My dad only had some fried rice to fill his stomach. We spent more than $120 for nothing. . I don't know why so many people here loved this buffet. Maybe they provide good selection of western food. But for Chinese, keep away from there!!!
Went for breakfast on a Friday morning. Overall, it was pretty good. We didn't have to wait which was nice and unusual for this buffet. Service was solid but truth be told...they didn't have a lot to choose from. Maybe it's because it was breakfast and the lunch and dinner are better. The omelet station was on point but they didn't offer a lot of choices for people looking to avoid gluten or potatoes. The Bacchanel at Caesars was much better in my opinion.
I am a vegan so this review is specific to that. My meat-eating husband seemed happy. . . I am giving this place a 4 because of a 5 for service and 3 for food. Like most vegans, I am prepared to compromise at most places and won't mark them down for having a limited vegan selection but I was expecting more from a Wynn establishment. . . The small plates guacamole and hummus were very good and for dessert I asked if there was anything beyond the one vegan choice (tapioca) and the extremely nice chef went in the back and got some yummy vegan ice cream. Also I went to the pasta station and the chef whipped up a wonderful vegan Alfredo with my choice of add-ins. However, when I asked if any of the pastas were vegan he said no. WTF???  Why offer a vegan Alfredo but no vegan pasta?  No matter. I put it on some lovely vegetables and it was delicious. I highly recommend this to other vegans as the sauce was very, very good. . . Also, I want to note that the chef did offer to try and get some vegan pasta from somewhere else in the hotel. He didn't seem put off by it either - he seemed genuinely like he wanted me to really enjoy the food. So A+ service. . . So, Vegans, the key here is to ask if you don't see something that works for you they will work hard to make you happy.
I feel as though I should mention up front that I'm not a huge buffet person. I tend to watch portions (at least to a degree), so I take buffets as the option to try samples of many things. I'm also a vegetarian so the vast array of meat options are of no interest.. . Now to the Wynn Buffet - the service was great, and deserves a 5. . . The food had highs and lows. The cons - I was surprised that the options at the salad bar, fresh fruit, and breads were pretty limited. There was a section with a few types of cheeses and dried fruit, but the cheddar and Gouda were surprisingly flavorless. The pros - pasta station was pretty awesome, and the dessert selection (mini cakes, Rice Krispie treats, ice cream, etc) were good.. . Overall, I would say those who want a large selection of meats and desserts, or who want a large quantity of food, may be pleased but it was underwhelming given the expectations for Wynn and the $40 dinner price tag.
Five star for sure! Plenty of seafood and king crab, great atmosphere, aweskme service. This is the best buffet in Vegas. Cosmo is super close second.
This is by far the best buffet I have ever been to in my life! So much to choose from! Service is good...could use a little more friendliness.
I don't know what's going on with this place. They stopped serving king crabs only snow crabs. No sirloin steak, no nigiri only 3 cheap small rolls, shrimps are small, no pork ribs, I can go on and on. . What's going on Mr. Wynn if you cut back on quality you will see that your customers will start going elsewhere.. I for one use to rave about your buffet to everyone, not any more. . I will not be coming back here either, next time in town I will stick with bacchanal or try at the Cosmo. . You should really consider doing something about the selection and quality.
This once was my favorite buffet in Vegas, however, you can literally skip The Wynn's buffet altogether now that Wicked Spoon and Bachanal (Caesars) are open.  . . In a nutshell, the meat here was tough, food selection was eh, desserts were below average and atmosphere has not changed since 2006.  . . It honestly felt like a Reno buffet rather than a buffet from one of the better hotels in the strip -- unacceptable.
I am a bit confused by so many four and five star reviews on this buffet?! Have these people never been to a buffet before? Are they just mesmerized because they are at the Wynn and it looks pretty? Possibly they are just blindsided by the price they just paid? Whatever the case may be, this is the most overrated buffet in Las Vegas! Come on they couldn't even come up with a name for it, did they really think it was cute to call it "The Buffet"?. . There is not a great selection of anything and yet they charge you like you are going to be feasting on miles of delectable tastes and treats. Once they get you in, it's pure let down and you can begin at the frozen snow crab and room temperature sushi. But hey if your not a fan of seafood that's okay because you can always try the pasta bar, I hope you like penne or rotini because that's all the pasta they have and if you like barley warm sauce that taste like its  from a jar then you're in luck, they can serve you up the best pasta ever! Let's just say my days of making fun of the Olive Garden's fettuccine alfredo are no longer after this experience! If you still haven't found something that looks tasty, then just hit up the tried and true salad bar, because like at any buffet there is always the salad bar where you can make a giant salad and pile on the toppings, except of course here they have even managed to ruin the salad bar! They have the smallest salad bar ever with no selection of anything, which really sucks if your a vegetarian because almost all of the very few options that they do have at this buffet have meat in them! So mashed potatoes and veggie tamales for me it was. What topped off this dismal buffet was our dismal server, not one soda refill and he was nowhere in sight all evening.. . . At the end of the night I was just grateful that Mr. Wynn only took us for $30 to experience all that is The Buffet, because if I would have had to pay full price for my family of four I may have shot myself!
This Buffett is very mediocre. It's over $40 for dinner. For $40 per person you would expect the highest quality food and the most excellent service and this is just crap. The hostesses must get paid really badly because they're always in a bad mood and The food here is not very good. I also had to talk to a manager about there being a hair in my pizza. This is not a Buffett I would ever suggest. Especially because it's so expensive.
This is a great buffet!  It was well needed after I was out until 6:30.  There is something for every appetite there.  I was there for the lunch session.  . . We did have a slow server.  People around us were getting way better service.  I'm chalking this up as the guy was new, hung over, incompetent, or just having a bad day.
This is what a buffet should be!. We went here for brunch and everything was delicious and atmosphere was decadent. Can't wait to go back here for dinner next time we're in Vegas!
Why say no tochildren and parents. We tried to get a reservation for a birthday dinner and they wouldn't allow our 1.5 year old to join his mother's birthday celebration. Definitely not kid-friendly! And to think that we almost made our stay arrangements here. Wonder whether they send their guests with children to the local McDonald's for meals.
Definetly the prettiest buffet in Vegas. We came in on a Sunday night, and after waiting for about 20 minutes we were seated. The waiters were polite, and didn't seem to hate their job like a lot of buffet waiters seem to do. They have several stations, more than any other buffet I've been to in Vegas, but they don't have the biggest selection of dishes. That's not a problem though, because the food is definetly the best I've ever had at a Vegas buffet. The dessert selection was also great. At 84 USD (after tax) for two adults for dinner, I really can't complain, and if you like seafood/shellfish you'll definetly get a lot of bang for your buck. They also have endless wine/Bud Light packaged for 16 USD.
Loved coming here, they have great crab legs and a really nice selection of different food. The quality is great it's definitely worth the money. Not always too busy I've never been there yet where there has been a super long line so it's always a good time to go.
Just like any other buffet. Wearing a tank top andshorts on a hot day. The buffet has a dress code only for men. No tanks. Had to spend $12 on a shirt I didn't want. Walked past a few dozen woman with tanks or sleeveless shirt. I hate double standards.
This buffet lives up to expectations on all fronts: atmosphere, service and food. I love it here and mostly because it's just adorable! It's like Alice in Wonderland meets Vegas with the decor. Upon entering, you're immediately welcomed by a quirky food wonderland. Everything is high-end and clean and it's not overcrowded like other buffets in Vegas. It truly follows the Steve Wynn theme. . . The food here is gluttony delight. They have just about everything here: seafood, Italian, Mexican, Asian, fried food, baked food, grilled food, meats, desserts, soups, bread, more bread, pizza....you name it they have it. I especially loved the dessert bar filled with Alice in Wonderland approved delicacies. . . Note: if you use a red card while gambling here, you could score a discounted or free buffet so make sure you do it! . . Reservations are accepted and highly recommended!
Not a huge fan of buffets or obesity, but I am a fan of The Buffet. . . No bragging involved but this none Vegas buffet goer did some extensive research. I checked Yelp reviews, browsed the web, and called around to ask for prices. In the end I decided on The Buffet. The prices were most reasonable ($95 for brunch for 4, none holiday weekday pricing) and I think the food was pretty good, not 5 start restaurant good. . . My favorite part was the dessert bar... When you go to buffets you gotta come with a strategy. My strategy is always to bring accomplices. If everyone takes one bite then you can try many more desserts. This was the only time my plan failed. There were waaaaaaay to many to try! Even though I knew I would fail I knew I had to try because I, Chang L. am not a loser. I came, I plated and I chowed down. . . I think the Caesar's palace buffet would have been great too (according to the reviews) but this one was more affordable and I would walking through the Wynn. :)
I haven't been to many buffets in Vegas, but this one is awesome. The staff was friendly but not overbearing, and those behind the serving stations were always putting fresh food out for people to grab. The mac&cheese was phenomenal and the mashed potatoes were spot on. Salad bar was nice, lots of options including pre-made caprese salads -yum! I certainly enjoyed my meal here!
The Buffet by The Wynn fell short of buffet perfection in many ways.  The interior of The Buffet feels dated, from the furniture and lighting to the large fake flower show pieces, I was reminded of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the 1971 version.. . The quality of the food was mixed. I really enjoyed the carved beef and roasted brussels sprouts, but couldn't find any fruit except the grapes that were garnish for the charcuterie station.  The salad station was very poorly managed.  All of the prepared salads were picked over or empty both times I went by and the desserts were nothing special, a little dry and mostly too sweet.. . If you do try The Buffet, take your time and find the things you want to eat.
The food is not worthy the money for brunch. Very limited seafood, only small shrimp. Cost $81 for 2 people. Maybe better for dinner, or I'm not a steak/bacon/desert guy. Very long queue outside, but many empty tables inside. I believe the buffet in San Diego where I live in is with similar quality but cost only $15 per person for lunch.
Seriously one of the most diverse and well designed buffets I have been to. I was disappointed with another buffet in Vegas so I wasn't expecting much of this one, but when I entered, the interior was delightful and bright. The food ranged from Mexican to Asian to great crab legs and etc. I enjoyed everything I put on my plate and the dessert selection was to die for. I stuffed my face and I wish I could have eaten more, but I had my own limitations. This place is a prerequisite for a complete Vegas experience. I recommend everyone to come here and eat. Just a friendly reminder to the men, they have a dress code where you have to have a shirt with sleeves. No tanks!
I came here instead of Caesar's Palace's buffet because of the more affordable price. I had no complaints except for the poor imitation of the Chinese Peking duck. The desserts were delicious and aplenty - my sweet tooth was extremely pleased. The atmosphere/decorations/uniforms transported me into a different decade - maybe the 60's or 70's? Very interesting feel.
The Wynn was a disappointing buffet. I tried several on the strip, and this was the worst. Any buffet will have food that you like and food that you don't like. However, there was little here that I liked. Of the dishes that this buffet served that were also served by the other buffets, the Wynn's version of the dish was always worse than what I got at the other buffets.
It's kinda pricy but it's all worth it.
I might be a tad bit harsh, but in comparison to other buffets I've had in Vegas, this deserves a 2 stars in my book. Located at the fancy shmancy Wynn, we've heard great things about this buffet being the freshest, the best, in Las Vegas and we were beyond excited to try it out. . . The unpleasant surprise we received when arriving at The Buffet drowned our mood the entire time. And that surprise was that men cannot wear sleeveless tops. Since its the Wynn, I suppose the owner wanted a more fancy and elegant type dining to match the Wynn's reputation, but let's be real, its a buffet in Vegas. And its hot during peak tourist time (spring/summer/fall), so men are bound to wear sleeveless tops. Anyways, we thought it was a dumb rule for a buffet, but we opted in buying a $12 tshirt for my boyfriend since he had a Jersey on and our hotel was too far of a walk to grab a shirt, and we really wanted to try out the buffet. The tshirt was a plain gray shirt with the logo Wynn on it. We thought it was a tad bit sexist since lots of ladies, including myself, were wearing revealing dresses, short shorts, crop tops revealing their bellies, etc. Sucks to be men in Vegas, I guess.. . The foods were definitely fresh. The layout of the buffet was clean, elegant, and even though the mirrors made me lost at times when I was wandering, I enjoyed the atmosphere. I decided to spend the extra $13 (I think) on bottomless mimosas. The server refilled my mimosas almost every 5 minutes which I am grateful for. . . However, since its a buffet, the foods do stay out for quite awhile, especially unpopular items. I had the salami/prosciutto which tasted like it's been sitting out for hours. The spicy salmon roll were okay, Bellagio $20 buffet definitely tasted better in that aspect. The variety of the foods were quite disappointing, I didn't get that much items on my plate. They had rice porridge Chinese style, but thats dirt cheap to make. I expected better foods to be out. Plain veggies in containers to make it look fancy. The dessert section was okay, I liked how they had gelato. However Wicked Spoon's dessert trumped that in the dessert section. The fish were fresh, but I wasn't fond of the flavors/sauces it came with. One fish dish had cranberry on it. . . Overall, we had high hopes and were disappointed in the end. It's worth a try, just make sure to dress appropriate. It was $33 for a Sunday lunch without bottomless mimosas.. . I need to make one last comment: THERE ARE NO CRAB LEGS. You would at least expect the "Wynn" buffet to have crab legs, especially paying for a costly fee. No oysters. Just cold shrimps. My heart dropped. Should've gone back to Bellagio's for $20.
The Buffet was met with high expectations and delivered upon first sight of the food, however the taste deducted everything we first believed. Although the selections were many the taste was mediocre at best. Nothing was over the top.  Looks alone was definitely not worth the $38 ticket. Of all the meals we have eaten in Vegas this one was the worst and the most expensive. Would not recommend or return.
Food 7/10. Customer Service 7/10. Comfort 8/10. Price Value 7/10. Overall 7/10. . Was here for EDC weekend. It was the cheaper selection of all the other buffets. Got in right before DINNEr started.. so it was like 30$ with fees as opposed to dinners $45. Lunch was mehhhh... had like some salmon, sausages and mash potatoes. Nothing extravaganza. Dinner came out and there was like Alaskan Crab Legs, shrimp cocktail and PRIME ribs. The ribs were bomb.... It was a comfortable setting with classical decoration with a Alice in wonderland like theme. Recommended for a quick and cheaper buffet on vegas.
The Buffet at Wynn is in my top 3 'must eat' buffets in Vegas. The selection is not as wide as say, Bacchanal or Carnival World, but the quality of food is definitely top notch.. . FOOD. Ahi poke tuna - so soft!. Minestrone soup - average. Veal short rib - very delicious and melty/fatty. Waffle batter fried chicken - yummy!. Gourmet salads. Meats - really yummy. Seafood - not as fresh. Desserts - visually appealing with attention to details!. . AMBIENCE. Fairly bright and open. I love the decor at Wynn because there are flowers everywhere! There are even flowers on the display cakes - which, btw, look amazing.. . OVERALL. I feel like despite the price, ($40 for dinner) this buffet is more worth it. It's cheaper than Bacchanal ($55 for dinner) and you get the same great quality of food. The only downside is that the lines are always long to pay and get seated, but all the popular spots are like that. This is a great buffet to visit if it's your first time in Vegas since it's not the MOST expensive buffet, yet you can still experience the luxurious excessiveness that is Sin City.
