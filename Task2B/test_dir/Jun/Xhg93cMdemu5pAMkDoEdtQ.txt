A hot day with a group of girls craving for some chocolate led us to Serendipity. We just wanted dessert so we ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate - one regular and one with a Mint Chip flavor.. . We also ordered a slice of the cheesecake creme de la creme.. . The Frozen Hot Chocolate was good - it didn't blow my mind but it was packed with chocolate flavor and had a slushy milk chocolate feel. The four of us shared one and that was enough for all of us. Four huge straws and a mound of whipped cream and chocolate chips on top. Nothing fancy, just a large quantity.. . The slice of Cheesecake was HUGE. The cake wasn't overly sweet and had a wonderful cream cheese whipped cream on top that complimented everything pretty well. We worked our way eating around the cheesecake but could hardly make a dent in it! There is a raspberry jam at the bottom tjat also gave you a different take on the flavors. The cheesecake was my favorite.. . I'm docking off a star because of the price. It came out to be a nearly $50 check for hot chcocolate and cheesecake....the food was good but not that good. You could be paying for the ambiance, but it isn't to the level of 4 Stars like some other dessert places on the strip.. . Bottom line: you can do it for the experience, but I'm sure there are better dessert places. What does the word serendipity mean anyway???
It's good for breakfast though the rest of the menu stinks. And it's quite pricey. I would not recommend this place for food.
Long line, but we ordered the frozen hot chocolate at their outside to go area. It wasn't as pretty if you ordered inside. (Its just in a regular cup) but still tasty!
Big portions. Share your food! Best Vegetarian burger I've ever had with a patty made from bulgur, farro, corn and all kinds of other yummy stuff.
We stopped by Serendipity on a Sunday afternoon and took a seat at the outside bar. It was such a relaxing little spot and not too busy. I've been to Vegas several times but it was always really packed the previous times we tried to go so this was a very nice change. The bartenders were very friendly and helped us to decide the size of our treat. . . We ended up getting a peanut butter frozen hot chocolate. It was delicious! It came out pretty quick and was just enough for 2 people - any bigger would have been overkill. I recommend getting the regular sized one and not the size built for 2...unless you really want A LOT of frozen hot chocolate. I would come back for sure.
On our way out of Vegas, we stopped by Serendipity for a Frozen Hot Chocolate, which we'd had a couple years back. It was indeed a warm Friday afternoon so a nice cold drink would be a welcome treat, which it was; delicious even. That's what the 2 stars are for. Everything else about this place was no good. At 11 bucks for a cup of cold cocoa with whipped cream on top, you'd think they'd at least remember to actually GIVE you your drink. Others in our party were called up to pick up their drinks. We waited another five minutes and finally went to the window to ask. They'd forgotten to make it.  FAIL. Also, they charge a whole dollar for tap water. Seriously, we were paying customers, give us the darn tap water! Tasty, yes. Overhyped? You betcha.
We got one frozen hot chocolate to share and it was the right amount of chocolatey sweetness. I love chocolate but sometimes it's a little too sweet for me, but sharing it was definitely a great idea.
Came here on a Friday late night about an hour before closing. Service was slow and waiter got our 2 item order wrong. They were out of one of the topping options (which are few to begin with). Too many other options around to want to ever come back here again.
There's a lot of hype but not worth it. The food is good, but not mind blowing for the price and the wait. . . The hangover omelet had no flavor, over cooked, and was luke warm. . . The grilled cheese was probably good, but how can you mess up the grilled cheese? Oh by not having the soup ready at the same time. It also came out luke warmer best. . . Their hot dog... Is a hot dog... But bigger. That's all. . . There's a lot of hype on the frozen hot chocolate... It looks great in picture... But it's like melted chocolate ice cream. . . I gave it an extra star because their service wasn't terrible and the waiter tried to be nice as we were clearly unhappy.
I love this place! The milkshakes are to die for! Perfect for a hot summer day and it helps that they are right off the strip! No need to walk through the casino to enjoy! They also have the worlds largest Tiffany Lamp, right outside! It's huge!
The food was ok but definitely not for the price. Extremely pricey. I ordered a Asian chicken salad with barely any chicken. Basically a $2 salad with 9x the price. Probably won't come back. Adjust the prices to reasonable prices and I may consider revisiting if I'm in the area.
This place gets an extra star for the frozen hot chocolate alone! It was absolutely delish! I also ordered the French toast log which was really good but way too big for 1 person and some eggs/bacon which were forgettable but I can't stress enough how good the frozen hot chocolate was! It's one of Oprah's favorite things and I see why!
As a newcomer in the US, the size of dishes keep surprising me wherever I go. I try to follow my Mediterrenean diet but it backlashes quiet frequently. Seems like one country's Tortilla Espanola is another country's monster-sized Spanish omlette stuffed with veggy accompanied by sour cream n salsa with couple of Texas toasts on the sides. I'm not saying the food is not delicious. Quite often they are. Yet bigger is not always the better. . . Then you go to Serendipity... All the notions of healthy eating fade away.  Next thing I know I was tucked into the 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae' which is a MOUNTAINOUS chocolate blackout cake topped with chocolate vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, and hot fudge goodness embedded in the core. . . Eating dessert to me is what it means to shopping to most of the women. And I can affirm that each ingredient was carefully made and each were at the right consistency. Very very very DELICIOUS. But still it wasn't until I found serendipity when the hot chocolate fudge started leaking out from where it was hidden.  . . The size of the desert was so BIG that my boyfriend lifted it up to see if it measures up to his head in size. I haven't eaten burgers, salads etc. but I saw on the other tables people eating and those dishes do not fall short of the desserts.  A portion of anything is definitely for 2 people.Whoever says the opposite, not true. Otherwise the half will get wasted just like lot of ppl did at the restaurant we saw.  . . On the other hand, if you have a big mouth and stomach for food then go ahead!! But make sure you save a room for dessert. In fact, ''Life is Uncertain, Eat Dessert First''. (That would be a perfect motto for Serendipity)
Nope.  . . You are absolutely paying for the name and reputation.  The food was barely edible, and I had a hot dog - how do you mess up a hot dog?  . . The frozen hot chocolate was absolutely nothing.  I'm not even glad I tried it.  On top of that, it was insanely overpriced.  . . Maybe people aren't gambling in Vegas anymore because they can't afford to after they eat?
I love this place, I went for my birthday and i had the frozen hot chocolate with whip cream and oreos so delicious
Serendipity 3 is one of the cutest dessert places. They have a huge, HUGE menu! My boyfriend took me here because I wanted dessert and we decided to have dinner as well. We also brought along his brother and his girlfriend for a double date.. . The reason for my 3 stars is because I would rate the dessert a 5 and the dinner a 2. We both ordered pastas and I got the wings for an appetizer. The wings were really good. Flavorful. But both of our pastas were more on the bland side and had no taste really. My boyfriend kept putting salt and crushed red pepper but it just didn't do any justice. His brother and his girlfriend shared a pizza and nachos. The pizza came out and they forgot to put chicken on it. So they had to wait a good 15 minutes to even eat the pizza because it didn't come out until then. The nachos only had a bunch of stuff on one side and didn't have enough meat. It was basically more chips and just a little bit of toppings. . . The dessert on the other hand was amazing! We got two sundaes fit for the four of us. Huge and yummy. I couldn't decide because there were so many choices. . . The waiter was nice and always refilled our water. But the wait time was on the longer side.. . Definitely would come back for the desserts.
We went here on our honeymoon.  It was great but a little expensive.  Big proportions and fun atmosphere.  We got the Cheescake for desert and it was as big as my head!
This place is really cute and obviously if you've seen the movie Serendipity, it'll get you excited to dine here.. . I was kind of bummed since I didn't think their regular dining menu was all that impressive.  I had the lemon chicken but wasn't spectacular.. . If anything, I think this place is a great go-to place for desserts as I am in love with their frozen hot chocolate is what they're famous for.  It is delicious!  . . Probably will stop in again for desserts again but not for main course eating.
The frozen hot chocolate wasn't bad, but not worth all of the hype, especially not for $12. I would have liked them to have blended the drink a little more, and it's extremely sweet so the whip cream is necessary to balance it out. I got the "regular", which was the smaller of the two sizes that they had. I even shared the frozen hot chocolate with my sister and I wish I could have gotten HALF of the "regular". The Buffalo wings were decent.  The ABC burger wasn't anything special ; the avocado on the burger wasn't that fresh. . . The atmosphere is cute, and I liked the view of Las Vegas Blvd from the window. And our server was the nicest lady and was extremely pleasant, I think her name was Barbara :D
Going Down Hill - couldn't get a waiter to come to the table for 15mins. Had to beg for ice water refills, food arrived cold and tasteless.   Finished off with sharing a Frozen Hot Chocolate,  not worth the wait - all hype.  . . Very disappointed - Overrated. Overpriced. Over it.
This was my third time coming and I expected so much from my visit.... Boy was I WRONG! I made reservations and they ended up seating my family and I on a table that was Super wobbly.. FIRST the hostess was not friendly, SECOND the Waitress was not there to serve us for awhile THIRD FINALLY When we asked the waitress if we could change seats  instead of acknowledging us she called the Manger who "tightened the knob" but this didn't help at all explaining we couldn't move without having to wait... BUT WE HAD MADE OUR RESERVATION, not our fault. The waitress was prissy and rude. She didn't even want to serve us lemon in our water when clearly we saw another waitress passed by us with lemons.... . Additionally,  when we orders fries with our meal.. They gave us Precooked fries that were sitting out for over 20min (we know this because we were sitting next to the kitchen) so the FRIES WERE COLD and MUSHY. . Unless they change management . DONT WASTE UR TIME COMING HERE.
Awesome pizza but the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water. The couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately. We will not return
This place is absolutely horrible. If asked o honestly couldn't think of a worse experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I usually don't write reviews because I generally feel like each persons experience is always different. Sometimes it can be the waiter or just a bad thing you ordered and some people want to give the place one star for it. Well this isn't that. This place is genuinely the worst restaurant I've ever been in. And I've been to A LOT. It was my wife and I's 5th year anniversary and we picked this place out of any other in Vegas because it sounded fun and like it had a huge variety. We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it'd be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner. The mashed potatoes had the viscosity of water with a little bit of sand in it. HORRIBLE. We tell them our displeasure with our experience and are told "were sorry you feel that way", the end. I would never suggest this place to anyone in my life and I hope this place goes under and everyone that works there can never find a job in the food service industry again.
Frozen hot chocolate was delicious.  Food is good but service was so incredibly slow.
Run do not walk to this fun and delicious eatery. The entrees are off the hook amazingly delicious and I would  save room for the incredible desserts. Tomorrow is my birthday and Jesse added Chambord and fresh raspberries to my Frozen HOT CHOCOLATE which blew my mind. Make sure you to say "hi" to Sam the friendliest manager in Las Vegas the atmosphere is so fun.
I love this place! Their sundaes are AMAZING. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is just a bit over rated for my taste (if you like chocolate milk then go for it). The You get what you pay for at this place and the service is awesome. If you're visiting Vegas or even just a local, this place is a must.
I was inclined to go 4 stars, but why?! Seriously, I have no idea the reasons for the low reviews!. . We, like Sean G. back in May, got Marnie, and were super lucky for it. First off, we were seated before our reservation time, she came immediately, got our drinks within 5 minutes, and had taken our food order with 5 as well. Marnie recommended the crab cake sandwich that was off-the-Richter good, and our martinis were deeeelicious (bday cake and peanut butter cup)!!!!. .  Top off a great dinner and great service with a phenomenal deep fried Oreo sundae... SHUT THE F%&$K up! Is this place f' real?! Amazing! Never been more pleased with a meal.
Ive been here a handful of times, the food leaves much to be desired, its more of a quantity over quality place, but the desserts, are great! . The frozen hot chocolate is great, only to be topped by the fried oreo sundae.  This place is worth skipping dinner at what ever place you're at, no matter how good you think it sounds.  Its also right off of the strip, not even in caesars palace, its a separate smaller building right off of las vegas blvd.
Food is whatever. I just like the frozen hot chocolate. It's super expensive but what isn't on the strip?
I enjoyed eating here. Its my third time here and its about time I write a review. Ive only been here during brunch. Their omelets are huge! Comes with side of potatoes which was delicious. Thir frozen hot choclare is yummy :) great to share a size small with the familym ive had their mimosas before. its pretty good. Prices are a bit high however its like that in all places in vegas. . . Restaurant sits literally on the strip in front of Cesears Palace. I recommend outdoor sitting If the weather permits. Not too hot or not too cold weather, you should take advantage of the outdoor seating. Its great to people watch and just enjoy the Vegas atmosphere while waiting for your food!. . I recommend making reservations because it can get packed! and be on time because they cancel your reservation If you dont show up 10 mins after your reservation time.
Like JM., I was initially going to give Serendipity only 4 stars, but decided otherwise. The food and service here is excellent; I don't understand the mere three star overall rating. We made a dinner reservation a few days ahead and were seated almost immediately.  I ordered lettuce wraps with chicken and fried crispy noodles, which came with 3 different sauces: 1) chimi churro, 2) red Thai slightly spicy sauce, and 3) a peanut sauce, all of which were absolutely delicious. Mom ordered the burger without cheese and loved it, and also loved the saltiness of the fries. Sister and her bf ordered something else but not sure what... they enjoyed whatever they ordered though. Also tried the double frozen hot chocolate, which was nothing special... tasted just like a chocolate shake. However, it was still a tasty end to a delicious meal.. Most surprising was the waitress's (can't remember her name, sadly) ability to remember all of our orders without even having to write them down. Very impressive!! . Whenever I return to Vegas, I'm definitely visiting here again to try other items on the menu, especially the desserts!
Super long wait,  so we went to the to-go order window outside.  A plastic cup of frozen hot chocolate was $11 and let me tell you... it is not worth the wait nor the money.!!! Tasted like watered down cold hot chocolate. Sad day.
Two stars for the desserts and cute building. The food however, quite disappointing for the price, I ordered the all hail Caesar salad for $14 and what I received was a pile of romaine lettuce and a single crouton. Sure there was a good portion of lettuce, but the lack of ingredients makes me question how they even call this a salad. The SINGLE crouton was pretty much a square piece of bread with no flavor and added nothing special to the salad. I advise against ordering the Caesar, maybe even going to Serendipity 3 at all.
Definitely eat in the restaurant instead of ordering through the window. You get a lot more options. My boyfriend and I had the wings and wagyu sliders. The sliders so so so good. We just had a few appetizers since we were going to eat buffet later, so I'm not sure about the actual entrees. It did seem a bit pricy and nothing really caught my eye, but stopping by for some appetizers and the desserts is worth it. . . I got the double frozen hot chocolate last time I went to Vegas and it was too sweet. This time I got the almond amaretto frozen hot chocolate. Good call because it was DELICIOUS. It was sweet but not too much. Perfect after walking around in the hot sun all day. It is probably a good thing I can't make this myself because I would drink this every day over summer.
So I get to the door to be seated at 10:30 the hostess said that they weren't taking anymore tables to dine in and suggest I go to their Togo window outside so me and my boyfriend are waiting in like for about 10 min and some guy comes out telling half the line that they aren't taking anymore Togo orders because it will be after 11:00 the time everyone orders. So I'm pissed because I just paid $10 to valet my car and I rushed to be there by 11:00 the time they supposedly closed at so I ask the guy why is it that we just been wasting our time standing there for nothing and then point to some random guy in line and says he's holding the sign... Oh!? So the sign that a CUSTOMER who GETS his food is responsible for holding a sign that says he is the last person in line to order.... Wow makes pretty good sense seeing as how NO ONE SAW THE SIGN! Because there were 10 people behind that guy! I seriously can't believe this! If you close at 11:00 and don't want to make food until 11;00 then make your closing time the actual time you stop seating and serving Take out at the special "take out" window outside!
OMG the best breakfast we have even had. It was also our favorite meal we had the entire stay in Vegas. We went for breakfast on our last day, we sat down and took a look at the menu. $20 for French toast.. OUCH of course like every other place pricey, but soo worth it. My husband and I shared and it was more than enough, we could barely finish it. I wish I would have taken a picture because it was beautiful and delicious! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing, I would definitely go again and recommend anyone who loves decadent sweetness to go there.
My husband and I came here for our last date until our baby arrived. I was 9 months pregnant and just wanted to go somewhere fun and out of the ordinary. This place was an excellent choice. Great atmosphere and great food. One tip I would give is to just valet at Caesar's Palace!
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. The flavors and ideas are unique. When you're in Vegas a frozen hot chocolate is like a Godsend. Def try the frozen hot chocolate if you've never been but make sure to have it inside so you can have it in the big pretty bowl and get the "full" experience. The Oreo is my favorite flavor!
I've only eaten their Giant desserts, and have NO experience with the food. We bring the whole family to the Strip to walk around and we usually stop by here and have an ice cream. Our family of 5 rarely finishes it and its really good not just big. Fun place to people watch as it is usually pretty busy.
This review is only for the frozen hot chocolate because that's all I order.. . If you're like me and only ordering the frozen hot chocolate, then walk in and grab a seat at the bar to skip the long wait.. . My favorite is the regular frozen hot chocolate and the frozen mint hot chocolate. Make sure you are SHARING because the portion is quite large and sweet. The regular one is yummy, but because it's so sweet, I have a hard time finishing the whole thing. I like the mint one because it's not as sweet, so I can drink more of it :). . Oh, this time, I also ordered the cheesekcake. It was the largest cheesecake that I've ever seen in my life and I was still eating it for days after.. . Tip: Check in on Foursquare for a free frozen hot chocolate with a $10 purchase
I went to this place several times while I was in high school. It's ESPECIALLY great place for high school students when it's for a sadies date or it's your prom night.. .  I wasn't a big fan of their main dishes, however, I loved their sweet potato fries and desserts! They're known for their huge, delicious desserts. I've tried the frozen hot chocolate and oreo sundae. BOTH great! MUST TRY.  . . I really like the location. You have the option to sit outside and overlook the busy strip.
What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. There's no question the food is awesome, desserts are like heavens little pillows, everyone wants one! It's hectic and seems messy because the staff is so busy serving there's not enough time to clean up. That would be my only qualm, but by far that is a little one. I would be back for another banana split or that cheesecake that walked by me! That looked tempting!
I love this restaurant. I have been to the NYC location and loved it so I thought it would be the perfect place to go in Las Vegas. This restaurant is so fun and perfect for any get together. The food is delicious and the dessert is ridiculously fun and made for sharing. Every sundae I have ordered there has been amazing and it is a fun place to go for a great time! The location is also really good and easy to find.
Had a great night. Came on with 3 of my friends. It was very busy but the hostess and manager made sure we were taken care of while the other manager was helping clean tables. Do see that every day. ( managers cleaning ) I'll be back next time for sure.
My family and I went to Serendipity 3 for desert. I was told this place was well known for its ice cream. So we walked from the New York-New York. We ordered the Banana Split Sundae. It definitely fed four anxious family members with ease (and I'm a pretty big individual). . . Bottom line: it was good but not worth the pricey tag associated with it.
Had brunch at this place on a Thursday.  There were no lines and no wait.  The food was average.  I had the hangover omelette.  Way too much fries.  The omelette was stuff with fries while having a side of fries.  Not a good combo.  Also had the oreo desert and that was good.  But that was the only good thing, the deserts.  The food was not good.  Felt like they are a place to eat desert and not food.  One member in our group ordered their pizza and it was burnt.  I told them to take it back and comp us for it, which they did.  . . Overall, I would not come here for the food, but I would for the desert.
Management reorg needed ASAP! This place would be so much better if someone that worked there actually took pride in their job. Over priced food that was just okay tasting. Ordered a piece of party it's like your birthday cake for dessert, it had finger prints of the person that cut it then grabbed it with his/her hand and placed it on the plate. I should've read the other reviews before wasting $75. The table next to us sent back a plate as well, not at all what we expected. Very disappointed. I've worked in the restaurant business and most horrible restaurants are due to poor management... Not coming back here again.
With all the places to go in Vegas, you would think people would know a thing or two about customer service. This place is a hot mess. We made a reservation for 9 and there is a "minimum amount" per person to spend. That is ridiculous in itself but the staff is beyond rude!!! We made a reservation. When we got there, They said they could sit us outside and they didn't have a table for us. Its 105 degrees in Vegas why on God green earth would we want to sit outside? What was the point of the reservation again?. I asked to speak with the manager and she was rude as well, so I wasn't getting anywhere with her. . The food was meh. Not worth going back, especially with the rude customer service!!!
Happy that I got to try this place!  We went there around noon before it got busy so got seated right away.     . . Frozen hotchocolate (3.5/5)  -- ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two.  When the server carried it out I was like wow this is huge!  If you just want to try it I think ordering a regular size and sharing it is a good idea.  The drink itself is pretty filling so I was already half full before the food came out.  The drink was good. Very rich.  Cold and refreshing.  Perfect for a hot summer day.  I would have given this 4 stars if it was less sweet.   . . Strawberry waffles (4/5) -- strawberries and whipped cream  sandwiched between two full size waffles with more strawberries and whipped cream on top.  The waffles were really fluffy, moist, and buttery.  They were thick so when you bite into it you get that light fluffy texture.  Very good.
