Back at the Wynn in the Tower Suites. In my mind still one of the best places to stay in Vegas. Rooms are well appointed and spacious. Having the separate entrance and guest registration for the Tower Suites is fabulous as you avoid the cattle call at the main guest registration. SW Restaurant is great and  Wing Lei is pretty good if you want a more casual meal. Gym is excellent and plenty of good shopping without having to leave the property. Want to expand your choices, go right next door to the Encore.  A really nice property that compares well with the best in the city.
If you have the means I highly recommend an upgrade to a tower suite. Oh and room service is so much better than having toother people. Can't wait to do it again.
I've been here over 20 times. I even brought friends! I've lost at least two thousand each time. My friends a $1000. I'm not coming back . Embarrassing!!!! At least let us play!!! This casino takes ur money within 20 min. Most casinos let u enjoy the night if u spend that much. This one sucks it up!!! Don't go!!!
All the time I've lived in Las Vegas and this is my first trip to the Wynn.  I've been the Ballagio after Wynn heretofor known as "the hell hole".  Waling through the Wynn, the casino, the shops and dining there you can see what Steve Wynn is famous for... attention to detail and perfection.. . I have no idea what the rooms are like but the casino was beautiful, up to date, I couldn't even smell cigarette smoke.  Spotless bathrooms.  Immediate assistance everywhere.  I wish I had a few grand to drop on a "staycation" with full spa services... . I'll be going back for sure and probably to dine at one of the many restaurants.  I came mid day so went to the cafe and it was great so expect the same experience for a dinner date!!
Gerade auf Tripadvisor kann man oft das Wort "teuer" lesen. Wenn man nicht rechtzeitig oder last minute bucht, kann es teuer werden. Das gilt aber nicht nur fur das Wynn sondern fur alles. Dennoch: solch ein Luxus und Top-Zustand auerhalb von Vegas ware dann noch viel teurer. Daher ist das Wort "teuer" hier meiner Meinung fehl am Platz. . W-LAN ist in der Resort Fee enthalten und das Valet Parking ist gratis (naturlich gegen Tip bei der Abholung).. Das Wynn und auch das Encore sind sicherlich die "geschmackvollsten" Hotels am Strip und in Top-Zustand. Die groen Designer sind en masse vertreten. Fur einen Aufpreis hatte man uns die Tower Suites angeboten und das ist wirklich einmalig, denn diese Zimmer sind abartig gro und schon.. Auf englisch sprachigen Rezensionen kann man nachlesen, dass man im Casino schnell sein Geld los wird. Tja, dazu kann ich nichts sagen und tut auch nichts zur Sache, denn ich sehe das als Hotelbewertung.. Wurde wenn ich in Vegas bin und eine vernunftige Rate ergattre wieder in Wynn oder Encore fahren.
One of thee most beautiful hotels EVER!
It was thursday 06/12/14 and it was our last day at the Wynn casino before our flight back home the next morning.  Right off the top  if anyone that reads this knows me you guys know I worked at foxwoods so u know that when it comes to blackjack I know my shit. I think I know a thing or two about how to deal blackjack and  what attitude an personality u need to have..u would think especially in Las Vegas that all the dealers are  a little more up beat. I ran into a dealer by the the name of STEVE who was an elderly dealer with two gold bracelets on his right wrist and fairly not so nice attitude. I didn't think much of his persona or attitude because frankly he didn't have one and the part that got me pissed off to even say I will NEVER step foot into Wynn again is that he told me I didn't know how to play blackjack. I asked him clearly and asked him to repeat what he said and bluntly he said "you do not know how to play blackjack" joking or not joking as a dealer who make most of their money from tips should clearly be fired. It doesn't matter if your are a $10 player or a millionaire whale!  You NEVER, NEVER.  ever under any circumstance say those word to anyone even if they don't know how to play. So unfortunately because of this one dealer Wynn will no longer be seeing us their. Thank u Mr asian dealer for making this happen it would have been 5 stars now because of u Wynn casino will only be getting 1 star
This would be 4.5 stars.. . My second trip to Las Vegas with my wife.  First trip was back in February 2004 at The Bellagio in a standard room.  That was a 5 star experience due mostly to the staff, quality of the property and amenities.  That was 10 years ago but it is all I have to compare to this trip, which I will do.. . We stayed at a Parlor Suite on the 38th floor with a strip view.  Hands down, this was the finest room I've ever stayed in a hotel or resort.  Including places such as The Ritz Carlton in Battery Park, The Plaza in NYC, The Beverly Hills Hotel and the fore mentioned Bellagio.  The Wynn property is by far, the most beautiful I've ever seen.  All top notch appointments and the quality and detail of virtually everything Wynn, is second to none!. . We dined at:  Zoozacrackers Deli, The Buffet (lunch and dinner) and SW Steakhouse.  The deli was good and on the high side of reasonable in price but after all, it's The Wynn we're talking about here so quality ambience comes at a premium.  . . The Buffet for lunch was very good and worth the money while the quality ofthe food was decent considering it was a buffet.  Dinner however, was disappointing.  Fairly poor service, inattentive wait staff and some of the offerings weren't all that hot.  Avoid the crab legs but the carved prime rib was pretty tasty and savory.. . SW Steakhouse was altogether different.  Pricey but "exceptional".  Attentive, professional and courteous staff that appreciated our desire to keep a handle on the budget for the meal yet still treated us as well as the high rollers all around us.  I cannot say enough good things about this group of people whom served us quite possibly the finest Rib Eye ever.  The aged steak was brazed to perfection and was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  My tastebuds were literally in fantasyland!  The bill came to $240 for two, including wine, a side dish, dessert and tip.  Money well spent.. . Where The Wynn falls short is on two issues.. . First, for staying in a expensive suite, I did not feel "pampered".  Certainly not as we did at The Bellagio ten years ago.  While things may have changed everywhere in regards to staff issues, our service here overall was "good" but not "great".  . . The second issue which is on the same concept, was the valet.  We arrived in the afternoon in a rental car which was a Chevy Impala.  The valet did not attend to us the way I would expect as the valet for the Tower Suites, is located separate from the general entrance.  By the 6th night, I would think that the attendants would recognize a suite guest and act accordingly.  Not that such service should differ for anyone but a paying guest in a top category room, should be treated much better than we were.  My wife had to open her own door and twice, I had to approach the staff for service.  We got better service at the casino valet at the MGM which is unacceptable considering the cost of our stay.  . . This may sound trivial and maybe it is.  However, premium hotels should have premium standards.  When "common" people like myself, choose to splurge a bit for a quality experience, I should have an expectation that this experience, should be just as good as it is for high rollers.. . I still highly recommend The Wynn and in most regards, it is a premier resort.. . NOTE:  we don't gamble, so I can't evaluate the very plush casino.  Other than to say that the cigarette smoke is a bit annoying but it isn't nearly as bad as it is in some lower caliber casinos.  It looks very nice though.
I will be short ..Best in class all the way..Steve Wynn. Style. Expensive you get what you pay for.Single twenties thirties..try Encore.One star less  pool overcrowding.lots of encore guests use Wynn pool. Otherwise savor and enjoy,,Employees top notch.
The Wynn Resort is simply the best in Las Vegas! Every aspect of this place is immaculate, and the employees are professional and courteous, unlike the others. Steve Wynn hit it out of the park again. This time, a grand slam!
A few years ago I went to XS Club and loved it that I planned to celebrate my birthday there the following year.  Not wanting to deal with the hassles of getting hooked up to the club, I decided to make reservations for one room at the Wynn Hotel.  I was told that as a guest, I would be able to purchase tickets for the club.  On the big day of my birthday, with 7 friends and family in tow, we headed to the concierge to buy tickets.  They would only allowus 4 tickets per room which meant I couldn't buy tickets for the remaining 4.  We asked if we could ask any of their guests if they would be willing to let us buy tickets from their room, which they were fine with, however it came with a catch.  They had to be charged to the room.  At that point, we didn't feel confident asking guests this favor even though we had the cash to pay for them, especially when we spent the last 30 minutes pleading to the concierge, which is a joke.  These fancy hotels and their fake concierge services are just people selling you tickets.  They can't hook you up, they can't work around their "system", and are completely inflexible, despite the fact this was my birthday!!  This really bummed me out because I had planned for this event for months and made several calls to their reservation and concierge service, and they assured me that I would be able to get into XS Club.  No one ever mentioned that there was a limit per room and that they had to be charged to the room.  How INCONVENIENT is that??!!. . To make matters worse, I lost my camera at Tryst the previous night.  I came by the club the next day and asked security to see if they would let me so I can look for it.  They gave me the run-around, sent me to Lost & Found, asked me to talk to their managers who were no help at all.  I returned back to the club and pleaded with security to let me look for it, and they just gave me a bunch of excuses. That camera held thousands of photos from my trip to Northern and Eastern Europe which I completed before I headed to Las Vegas for my birthday.. . Hence my entire birthday was ABSOLUTELY RUINED!! Everybody on their staff from the concierge to security was ridiculously USELESS!!  I was almost in tears having lost my camera containing memories from a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Europe with my aging parents, and extremely upset over the fact that I was not fully informed of their ticket purchasing policy, and how inflexible every single person was.  Not one person had any compassion about my plight and just kept telling me, it's their policy.  Yes I understand the merits of policies and you have to have them to have structure and order especially running a huge establishment, but I think it's fair to say, my situation was an extenuating one.. . My friend filled out an online survey complaining about the issues we had and received a reply from Brett Rubin who responded apologizing for the AWFUL SERVICE. He wrote that "Please be assured that your comments have been shared with our management team and will be reviewed with the highest regard"  but no steps were taken to redeem the situation. I then wrote a letter to the President, Marilyn Spiegel and never heard back as well.. . I read almost every single review and most are positive with remarks about the comfort of the beds, the luxurious rooms, the beautiful architectural designs, cool clubs, etc.  However, the negative reviews all have to do with POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  One reviewer wrote about a rude black jack dealer, another about being with his family and how they were mistreated at the restaurant, and the list goes on and on and on.. . Yes, they score high with their aesthetics and amenities, but they SUCK when it comes to taking care of their patrons, when they have PROBLEMS.  Of course the staff is friendly to you, but when you have a problem, they have no idea how to help you out or solve it, without resorting to, "it's our policy."  I'm sorry, but that's just another way of saying, "it's not my problem."  Yeah, you're right it isn't your problem that I lost my camera but when you don't allow me the opportunity to double-check your facilities and trusting that your own cleaning crew won't steal a camera they see is ignorant and negligent.  Secondly, their staff misinformed me about buying tickets to your club.  Each time they assured me that entry will not be a problem being a guest in the hotel.  I might as well stayed somewhere cheaper like the Trump Hotel of Hard Rock Hotel where I still get the luxuries the Wynn has, and bribe the freaking doorman to let me and my friends in, or show boobs!  I just didn't want to deal with that crap and decided to go the safe way, and that still didn't work out.. . In closing, provided that you don't run into a problem then you may have a good experience.  But if you do have a problem, just remember, "it's our policy" to not [fill in the blank.]. . BTW, Yelp won't allow me to give ZERO STARS so I was forced to give it one!
After staying a few times the encore and wynn I was really impressed with mostly everything but the casino. They have great rooms very clean and modern. The room service and house keeping has a very professional team working making sure everything is to the guest satisfaction.. Great night life and restaurants.. I will probably visit the resort again soon.
The check in process was fast, and gentlemen was very friendly. Upon entering the room everything was clean and smelled quite pleasant. . . The tv and vanity mirror are the only two things that didn't work too well...they're well worn and need to be replaced. . . As with any of the finer hotels in Las Vegas, the drinks and food are pricey, but the staff is attentive and beautiful (cocktail waitresses). . . I was here for business but would come back for pleasure to really let loose.
I loved staying here. The rooms are modern and chic. The view is pretty amazingalso. The food in general tastes better than Paris Las Vegas and Bally's. There's free, good wifi in the public areas of the hotel. Everybody on staff are courteous and helpful.. . The only issues are that you have to pay $16 for wifi in your room for each device (but it's like that in every large Vegas hotel I've been to. At least this place is free downstairs), and it does smell like cigarettes everywhere. Also, some of the guests staying on the non-smoking floors don't care and smoke there anyway.
Just came back from 5 nights at Wynn.  I have been staying and celebrating my birthday here for the last 4 years.    We have visited and gambled at most of the hotels and all the newer hotels...but this is the only hotel that I will stay at in Las Vegas!  The service is fantastic, as are the rooms and the restaurants in Wynn & Encore.  We have always had the rooms with the wall-to-wall view of the golf course.  In the casino, there are always staff cleaning, pushing in the chairs, and serving drinks.  Whenever I go to any other hotel in Vegas, it always feels like a zoo and definitely not as clean! . . Minor things to note: the wifi in the rooms are not always stable.  There are no coffee machines in the rooms, however, the coffee at Wynn's Drugstore Cafe I bought everyday is great.. . Thank you for another wonderful stay, Wynn.  Although we casino hop and check out the other hotels during our visits like when we go watch shows, nothing compares to Wynn and I will not stay anywhere else.  Beautiful hotel and we always receive great service.  See you next year.
Wynn hasbeen my favorite Vegas hotel since they opened in the fall of 2005. Steve Wynn doesn't oversee daily operations and every tiny detail the way he did in the beginning, and it's evident, but for my money it's still the best place to stay in Vegas. The restaurants, especially SW, are world class, the rooms are luxurious, and the "feel" of the hotel is like you belong to an elite club. Beautiful flowers, architecture, and people are everywhere you turn. It's a fantastic escape from the drudgery of everyday life. I only withheld a star because there are details not worth mentioning that go untended, but that make the difference between a 4-star versus a 5-star resort.
For such a nice hotel you would think there customer service would be up to par. Upon check in the staff was suppose to have in room surprise amenities awaiting my wife which they were not.(set up a week in advance) There form of an apology was a "room upgrade"... Same room just a few floors higher. The T.V did not work and neither did the in room movie service. There excuse was there are thousands of rooms and they can not keep them all working all the time. Nothing was offered for that. At adult pool apparently all the front row chairs are reserved for cabanas. Which is fine but make sure they are marked. We had a cabana waitress come over and yell at my wife to move because we did not have a cabana. Not even a please just yelled at her to move. The chairs she was sitting in were not marked in any way. All they had to eat at the pool was pre packaged sandwiches and when you are allergic to certain things it makes it pointless. I was so taken back on this trip. Upon checkout and speaking to multiple people no one even cared. They got our money and they were done with us. It was our first Time staying there and we will not begoing back. Should have stuck with the Bellagio which we are use to and will stay there from now on!! They had me fill out a comment card... Like I will ever hear anything back on that one what a joke.
I wish I could live here. All their rooms are suite styled and are very spacious. The beds are super comfy and I like how the drapes are electric and the lights are controlled by this iPad looking like remote. . Super convenient if you plan on going to xs, surrender, and or encore beach!
