To start I will say, this place is fantastic. That being said, the service is just OK. I have never had bad service but I have had mediocre service; long waits for easy things like refills, and forgotten order items, but all that can just be a fluke. I am in love with the food and even the people there. Everyone is cool to be around and no one is rude. . . There aren't substitutions or "create your own" options, but as an extremely picky eater, if you can't find a pasty you like, you should probably go to burger king and have it your way.. . Also the beer menu is great for Beer snobs, and welcoming enough for average beer drinkers alike. I don't drink wine, but it looked like a long list of options. . . All in all this is a near perfect establishment. If you are looking for a unique place to take someone and fill up on home cooked flavors, this is the place in Tempe. I happen to prefer the N Scottsdale Rd. location, but to each their own.
YUMM! I'm a vegetarian & I took my non-vegetarian friend to eat a veggie mexi which is mock beef & we were both super full and satisfied! The oven chips (fries)with garlic & jalapenos are also a must! The service is great & the waiters are all so kind. This is by far my favorite spot.
A great way to hit 300 reviews! . . We had heard only good things about this place, both on Yelp and from friends and co-workers that have been. We headed in and the black out curtains immediately made it feel like nighttime inside. After picking a seat at the bar we took a look at the menu and debated on the options. . . I opted for the Shepherd's Pie (Cottage Pie) Pasty and he went for the The Oggie. We then decided to share a side of "chips" (i.e. fries). The best part of sitting at any restaurant bar, is getting to see the workers do what they do. This place was even better for that idea since you could not only watch bartenders mixing up drinks, but the kitchen was front and center, so we were able to watch our food be made from start to finish!. . The food took a bit to come out, but each order is made fresh and the fries are baked, not fried, so it's worth waiting for. Both our Pasties were delicious and very filling! The fries were cooked perfectly, and it was nice to step away from the fried food world and still enjoy a great stuffed pasty and fries.. . The staff was very friendly and checked in on us regularly. We were so stuffed we didn't get dessert this go-round, however, it isn't out of the cards for the next visit!. . Overall: A. A quirky "hole-in-the-wall" bar with amazing food, fun staff, and great ambiance. Go!
Reminds me of a calzone but the variety is much larger. Pub, but friendly for dinner or lunch also
The food is heavy, not especially tasty, and the interior is very dark. Lots of people like this place and I've never figured out exactly why.
This was a unique dining experience.  The setting was subdued Irish pub. Dark polished wood, dim lighting, candlelight, and a variety of tables made this place inviting. The service was top-notch with the servers being knowledgeable of their items and making excellent suggestions.. . The food. I had the Meat and Cheese Pasty. Homemade pork and sage sausage, swiss and cheddar cheese, in a wonderful pasty crust. It was so tasty. I also had some rich garlic mashed potatoes with cheese. It was a lot of food with half coming home with me. Saving room for dessert, I had the Apple Caramel Pasty. Melt in your mouth heaven. Cinnamon, apples, and caramel all melt in your mouth in a fluffy pasty crust. A delicious meal.
cozy, loud and wonderful place.  delicious food and beer.
Expanded space and multiple locations deserves more stars! :)
This place is a bit obscure. It is kind of hidden from the main street as it is facing the residential road. I almost missed it on my way here! Once you go past the black door, you enter a dark, dimly lighted bar. There are large booths for large parties and tables for small groups. The bar extends throughout the entireplace so there is plenty of seating. The restroom cleanliness is typical for a pub and is well maintained. There are plenty of TVs if you looking to watch a game there.. . Since this place is known for their pasties, I decided to try one out. I ordered The Chicken Greek Pasty to go along with my Hoegarden beer. The portion size is just about right, wasn't too big nor too small. The pasty was hot and fresh. What made it really good was the sauce that was provided with the pasty. I almost didn't have enough for the entire pasty! My one gripe about the pasty is that I wish it had a bit more chicken. Other than that, it was superb.. . This place has a good happy hour menu and a pretty extensive selection of beers on tap and on bottle. The service was good for the most part. Other than forgetting one of the sauces for the people of my party it was pretty good throughout. They delivered our food and drinks in a timely manner and was helpful with the first timers with what to order. I wish I can give this place 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll have to give it four.
Excellent food & atmosphere. Sat at the bar with a full menu and had a great experience, reasonable prices, and great service! Definitely recommend the Peppered Steak pasty.
Truly awesome food, and a unique option in a sea of tempe's Thai, Mexican, and pub food dominated restaurant scene. While many pub classics exist on their menu, I've yet to see a pasty on anyone else's menu, let alone one as good as the ones at Cornish. My personal favorite is the chicken rosemary, with a side of HP sauce. Oven chips are a good appetizer, since it'll be about 30-40 minutes before you get your food. Awesome selection of import beers. Service is good, even when busy. Only downside is that they feel a bit overpriced, considering how much side dishes cost and no combos are available. For two people ordering pasties, 2 beers, and two sides, expect to pay around forty or fifty after a tip and tax. That said, you'll leave full!
Wow...we loved this place!  I had bookmarked this as a place I wanted to try a while back and I wasn't disappointed.  Never before had I had a pasty.  Clearly, I've been missing out!  . . This place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.. . My wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!. . We had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!
God, I love this place. Every location is awesome. The food is always great. I've never had a single problem other than having to wait because it's packed with so many other people enjoying the awesomeness. . . While I do love the pasties, it's great to venture to other areas of the menu as well. Their handmade soups are fantastic and I try to always save room for some. I've had both the Pavlova and the dessert pasty and I could go in for those alone.. . They usually have great music playing and the service is always friendly.
