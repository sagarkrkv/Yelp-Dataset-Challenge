It's been a while since I've been to a Hofbrauhaus. The last time I went was in Miami, which I fell in love with. The Las Vegas location is a lot bigger and not as quaint as Miami, I like the more nostalgic era. . . Our visit to the Las Vegas was nice, we came in as Walk In and was seated right away. I really wanted to have the Pork Knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. I was devastated! But I quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing.... . . The Bavarian Potato Soup- Like a loaded baked potato soup minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. It was topped off with croutons and chives. . . Sauerbraten- Bavarian style potroast w/red wine. It was good, not as tender as I thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. Yes spatzle! They look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! Love them. . . Red Cabbage- Wasnt a fan, I tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar red cabbage. I guess this is the Bavarian version of our American cranberry to Turkey dinner. . . Through our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! It was Classic! Love it!  . . Yes and the dessert! I had to getApfelstrudel! Apple strudel! It was great! Had to wait for my chantilly cream which made me think about the movie Inglorious Bastard with Hans Landa and the cream for apple strudel.... Reminiscing... It was great, wished the Pork Knuckle was available for us, that was the only reason I would go back for... . Thanks and good vibes!
I went with my family during the Memorial Day Weekend and we were not disappointed. The food was very good and the service was very fast. We had sausages, schnitzel, pretzels, pork cops, pork roast and apple strudel for dessert. The place was noisy and crowded, but this is understood since we went during the weekend. Highly recommended.
Really fun place...great beer and spankings! It's definitely more fun if you go with a party of 12 though.
It's cheesy, kinda pricey, and loud but you're coming here for the atmosphere. A ton of drunk people and parties but thats the whole point, right? This is Vegas remember. Live music and the girls handing out a "Paddlin'" left and right. Food was mediocre at best but after a few liters it really doesn't matter. A little bit off of the strip, cabs hang outside in advance so you shouldn't have a problem getting back to your hotel.
If you like German food and an Oktoberfest atmosphere this place will never disappoint.  The food is great and so is the service.  I haven't had anything here that our family didn't love, from steak to schnitzel to goulash.  It is all great.
I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! . . What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. . . Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. . . I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbrauhaus at least once.
I love this place when I want German food. We go there for Breakfast and Dinner.
As a vegan, I was really excited about their vegan option. The place is very unique, because you sit on wooden benches with strangers, people dance on the tables, there's a live ethnic band playing, and waitresses brutally spank people with a paddle when they take a shot.. . The food was just all right and overpriced, along with the alcohol (what you'd expect), but it was interesting.
This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit in Vegas! . . The large bier garden setting makes for a fun locale to enjoy authentic German cuisine and some delicious brews as well. There is always live music to add to the atmosphere. Waitresses walk around offering shots of jaeger, but they come with a spanking. This is a fun and entertaining tradition, especially when you buy spankings, er I mean shots, for your friends. . . The food is delicious and so is the bier, but the prices are little more than what I pay normally. BUT I do try to temper that knowing that we are in Vegas and everything costs more (even though it did not used to be like that). . . If you like German food, bier, music, and atmosphere this is a GREAT night out in Vegas before heading out to party more. I highly recommend.
So I think this place is completely different at night. And to be fair, I was here in the middle of the afternoon.. . The ambiance is cool. I liked the big giant hall and getting seated at a table with other people. And the live music was awesome and fun. 4 stars.. . We were seated promptly. But then waited over 20 minutes and still not a single server had even glanced at us. Finally, one of the people sitting at the same table as us went to find the server they had (who had just closed them out because her shift was over) and she then came and took our order. She then even delivered our beers. No clue what had happened to the assigned server. When the assigned server did show, there was no apology, no "I'll cover this round of drinks", no nothing. Not the type of service one is accustomed to in Vegas. 1 star.. . When weren't super hungry, so we just ordered the pretzel. It was a giant pretzel and came with two mustards and the special cheese dip. It was way over-cooked and not tasty. 2 stars.. . The beers were decent. There were 3 options, plus the seasonal. They don't offer samples. 3.5 stars.. . Meh. It's basically a tourist trap. I hope the actual food is good. Everything seems overpriced. They're big on pushing the gift shop items. Not sure if I'll return.
Love their beer!!   I was over the moon when I discovered they had a beer hall in Vegas, so this place was a definite must on places to visit while there.. . We had perfect timing as Germany was playing in the World Cup when we happened to swing by.  What an amazingly fun atmosphere.  My husband got the sauerbraten (very tender and not uber sour) and loved it.  I had a bite and definitely wanted more.  I don't tend to like a lot of German food (sorry), just not my flavor palette, but I definitely enjoyed theirs.  I even liked the side of cabbage (my husband didn't as much as another local to us German restaurant).  I had to get the Bavarian Cheese appetizer with pretzel and a caesar salad, both were mouth watering.  But the true highlight for me was their beer.  I was in 7th heaven!!  The downside, they were charging for water - when the bill came they charged us $4 for a bottle of water that normally costs around $1 at a gas station.  This was the most expensive lunch I think I have ever had, but it was worth it for us.  Their hefe weizen is phenomenal!  In case I forgot to mention that before ;P
I felt I was forced to go here coz my wife always wanted to so ok, I want her happy so there we were..the I was (again) forced to upsize my beer to a liter coz she ordered one for herself... I found the place strange, not somewhere Id hangout plus German style food is not usually on my menu so I was clueless..tall lady with bigunz walkin around with a paddle and grown men willing to get smacked in the backside by her.. Ok the food was good, real good.. The beer was great.. I had another..and by my second one I realized this is the most fun I've had in a while..it was crazy in there, they were nuts! It was loud and so much stuff goin on.. Singing and dancing most I didn't understand yet I was having a great time.. Just wished I had the pretzels before the beers..it was one hell of a time.. Can't wait to do it again.. Next week...
Awesome place as always. Best place to watch the World Cup!
It really doesn't get any better than this..This is by far the best German restaurant I've been to hands down.  Food quality is excellent, atmosphere is friendly and inviting .  I do recommend that you make reservations because this place will fill up quickly.  It's oktoberfest 24/7 with all the singing and dancing.  If you are coming for just a dinner and don't want to participate in the festivities that's fine too just remember you will most likely be sharing a table with people you don't know and they may want to stand on the bench style seats and do the chicken dance like everyone else.  Here's a tip..find the girl with the paddle and the shots. .5.00 ea. Honey or jagermeister.  If you come to Vegas this IS a MUST stop!  I will be back again!
I'll preface this review by saying German food is not my favorite, so I wasn't overly impressed by the food.  It is a very fun place to go though.  There is live music and you sit at long tables and it has a fun slightly rowdy vibe.  There are Jager girls that come around and sell Jager shots for $5.  In order to get your shot, you have to get paddled, and these girls don't hold back.  They hit hard!  Lifted one guys bum right up over the table.  the best part is they take commerative photos capturing your expression when the board hits your bum.  It's a fun place to go once but not some place I feel the need to go every time I got to Vegas.
I am rating them on the following.  Giant Pretzel $14 (it was not worth $14 maybe $7 or $8), beer's $8 ok,  lemonade $3 and the zinger is you can't get a glass of water with your beer or mixed coctail, you have to pay $3.49 for a bottle of water (that is just lame especially when you are buying a drink).
I have a special place in my heart for Germany and German food after studying abroad in Germany so this place was a must. The restaurant is huge with benches and tables with an authentic German feel. The biergarten was absolutely beautiful and the place was pristinely clean. I went with my mom for lunch and there was barely anyone there. Our waitress was friendly as can be and went through the menu with us to tell us what her recommendations were. We ordered the appetizer mini pretzel and the breaded pork with a side of potato salad and cranberry sauce. The pretzel was really good as well as the meal we were able to share. Everything was really good. Their beer also did not disappoint. I got a Radler which is lemon soda and beer mixed and it was delicious! I don't know if I will go back but I really enjoyed this place and it brought me back to Germany if only for an hour or two.
I went with my father in law. He's German and wanted to have lunch there.  . Well, the hostess made us wait 20 minutes to finally take us back to an over crowed and very noisy room. She wanted us to seat and share the table with other people. Since the huge front of the restaurant was practically empty. I asked her if could seat there. She says she had to ask... While we waited, again, my father starting feeling weak and tried to seat for a minute. Quickly a waitress came and before he could seat, told us that we could not seat down. She had an attitude and my father is 87 years old!!!! I didn't want to argue!!! So we waited until finally the sat us down!. The waitress we got want that bad. The food was ok but I expected a lot more from the place! . I think is over priced! I've had much better breaded chicken in other restaurants and my father wanted the Veal and not the Pork Winnershnitzel but they don't make it here. . I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!. I don't recommend this place unless you understand the German culture!. It's not a pace to have a relaxed meal. . I do not recommend this place!
I love Hofbrau! Since I'm from Cincinnati, where just over the river we have an AMAZING Hofbrauhaus ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/hofbrauhaus-newport-newport-2?osq=hofbrau+house ) I've been spoiled by awesome German food and liter beers. . . This Vegas Hofbrau both lived up to the Vegas vibe and surprised me (they closed very early for Vegas) there was a good mix of live German and American music, which we all sang to. Delicious food and flowing beer taps. The waitresses were very nice and made us feel at home. . . Sure, this was a little more expensive than I'm used to, but it's Vegas and the beer was just as delicious as I remember. If you're up for a fun experience give Hofbrau a chance and remember Liter beers only (Half liters are for wussies)!. . Also, as an added Vegas bonus, if you buy a shot they'll bring it to you on a paddle and  even spank you if you're up for it. Only in Vegas!!
Go here only to get smashed and have a good time and you will get smashed and have a good time. Do not eat here.. _____________________. Ambiance and Location: 5. I've bumped this section to the top because your primary reason for your visit to this place should be to get smashed and have a good time (not fine dining). We went on the weekend, and it seems like they have a band here on the weekends that really adds to the experience. This, plus a paddle/jagermeister lady. The band kept coming around playing a large alphorn. They had a drinking contest and my girlfriend participated (free beer!). She lost but overall we had a pretty good time. I'm local-ish and I would still call this strip-ish. Close enough for a tourist, but far away enough from the strip to not be considered the strip.. +2 drinking contests, getting the crowd involved.. It would be a good idea to take a _____ here: group of guys to get smashed. _____________________. Service Quality: 6. My visit seems to be unlike other reviews. Our service was prompt, friendly, quick and accurate. We did notice some people who appeared like they needed better wait service, but this did not impact us (no negative score). Perhaps if you order the large 1L beers you don't need the waiter to tend to you so much and by ordering the large beers you can be proactive at preventing a bad service experience.. . Related but no impact on score: the gift store is friendly. Though it says they close at midnight parts of the restaurant close earlier so do not come here right at midnight expecting service. I would recommend 9-10 if you're doing it late.. +1 friendly. +1 fast. +1 accurate. . Time it took from ordering to get the food to the table: suspiciously fast (5 minutes, see food section).. _____________________. Food Quality: 1. A big let down. Most likely I will eat before coming here again. Only a few of the items we ordered appeared to be scratch made. I ordered the sausage platter, and I wondered if some of the sausages I got were the same ones I could get canned from World Market. They looked, felt (mouthfeel for consistency of sausage feeling) and tasted processed, not like scratch-made sausages. My first thought, even drinking: "I paid $20 for hot dogs ...?" Even the mashed potatoes were instant, or they were so poorly prepared as to seem like instant mashed potatoes. To cement this idea that it was instant: the food came out in 5 minutes. They offer a 'traditional poached style' where your sausages will be delivered in the water they were poached in. I was open to this, but I bet people will be put off by it; maybe upset if they pay $20 for a single entree. Overall the food quality was below average, with extravagant prices. An entree of 4 sausages, instant mashed potatoes and a side of sauerkraut came to $20. The one good item was the pretzel, which you could--and we did--order with some liver mousse came out to be $16. . . So you should probably not come here to eat. You should come here to get the big 1L beers. They come in big authentic 1L mugs and are pretty awesome. This is probably why you came here. Inevitably you will get drunk and probably order food, which is the only circumstance I would recommend buying the food, so you don't have the weight of paying $20 for instant mashed potatoes on your conscience. . -1 extravagant prices. -2 deeply disappointed with the food. +1 great beer. . What I'd get here: just beer.. _____________________. Cleanliness: 5. The restroom was clean, and the tables were clean. There is a lot of staff here so it's pretty safe. . +2 clean, clean.. Worst health code rating: B once on 5/8/12, A otherwise.. . Overall rating: floor(average(ratings)) = floor(4.25) = 4
