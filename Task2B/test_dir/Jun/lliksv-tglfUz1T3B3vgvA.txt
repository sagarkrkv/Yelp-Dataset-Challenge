It was just average.  I think I was expecting much more from seeing it on the Food Network.  We got the signature dishes but nothing to write home about.  I have to say, they did have the best Thai Tea I have had in a long time.  You could really taste the actual tea and not just a super sweet and creamy drink.  . We got there only 30 mins. after they opened and still had to wait 45 mins.  They do get your phone # so they can call you when your table is ready which I thought was really cool so we could go do something nearby.  . Allin all it was decent.
Fantastic; well worth the trip away from the strip. I live in LA and eat Thai food almost weekly, and Lotus of Siam is better than anything else I've had in the US.
This place is awesome! Crispy duck chu chee and drunken noodles with chicken so good! Number 7 out if 10 on the spicey scale was just right! Oh, and the fried chicken appetizer, boom, so good!. . Reasonably priced and fairly busy on a Tursday afternoon, perfect for the day after a night in Vegas. Not very far off the strip either. Not sure about walking here, a bit far, but we had a rental car. Go for it!
Always make reservations 1 week in advance!!!
Just like many others, I longed to visit Lotus of Siam after seeing Anthony Bourdain to there on his show. It seemed fortuitous because I saw the show one month before a planned visit to Vegas. After going there with three other foodies, we all agree that it's a must-stop while visiting Vegas! We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.. . We decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu.The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! . . It's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead. I'm already anticipating my return to this excellent restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas!
It's so hard to rate a Thai restaurant a 5-star because there are so many everywhere and a lot of them taste the same, but in this case, I give Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas a 5-star! It is my benchmark for all Thai places that I visit... This restaurant is a MUST try if you live in, or visit Las Vegas.. . Let's go through my recommendations:. . 1. Tom Yum Kai soup (5/5): The hot pot size feeds 5-6 and it's only $11.95. It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it has a good kick. The lemon grass and straw mushrooms make the soup taste amazing!. . 2. Crispy Duck with Panang  (5/5): I would actually rate this a 6 on a 5-point scale. This is my FAVORITE DISH at Lotus. The duck is so crispy with the curry on top of it. This dish is literally to die for.. . 3. Garlic Prawns (5/5): This is on the Chefs Choice menu - these are deep fried prawns with the shells on them and they are sauteed with garlic and pepper. Don't peel the shells! This is one of the most amazing dishes they have! Even though it's $21.95, it's very much worth the price. Get it!. . 4. Khai Soi Braised Short Rib (5/5): This is also on the Chefs Choice menu - another one of my personal favorites. The braised short rib is so tender; you can cut it easily with a fork. It's served over thai egg noodle in curry sauce, served with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This dish is a little pricey too at $20.95, but worth every penny.. . 5. Panang Curry with Chicken (4/5): The panang curry is really good here too. We rode it with chicken. It's only $11.95 for this dish, and it's a great traditional Thai dish to get with your meal.. . 6. Drunken Noodle Seafood (4/5): The drunken noodle seafood is one of their top recommendations. These are pan fried flat rice noodles served with an assortment of different seafood (mussels, calamari rings, shrimp, etc.). It is only $12.95, but I must warn that this is a little bit on the spicy side, i.e. more than we expected.. . 7. Pineapple Fried Rice (4/5): We ordered this to share with a larger group, and it was surprisingly really good. I normally don't order fried rice when I go to a Thai restaurant because I can make it at home, but this was really good. Only $9.95 too for a good-sized order of fried rice.. . You can't go wrong with any of the options I've listed above. Of course, if there are just two of you going, you aren't going to order all 7 of the dishes (unless you are really hungry), but the top recommendations I have are the Crispy Duck Panang, the Garlic Prawns, and the Khai Soi Braised Short Rib. Not a whole lot of veggies in those options, but ehhhh, these are the best ones. Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can pay a visit to Lotus of Siam again. The restaurant itself is not in the best of neighborhoods, and from the outside, it looks like it could be a really crappy place, but do not be fooled. Go inside and taste the amazing savory dishes that I miss so dearly. Ok seriously, go there NOW!
The last time I have Thai food this good is when I was in Bangkok. Curry sauce is 6 out of 5. Holly molly gastronomically great food.
Not fine dining. . Mediocre service. . Extremely long menu for food and wine. . 5/5 stars for the food. The red curry is the best I've ever experienced.
One of my  favorite thai restaurants; It's always busy with locals and now more and more tourists from the strip hotels. Incredible wine list and fast efficient service. If you like thai food this is the place to go in las vegas
Taste: 4. Creativity/Authenticity: 4. Atmosphere: 3. Service: 4. Bang for your buck: 3.5. . Now how do you rate a thai restuarant that is known for well northern thai food and not "thai" food? do i rate it by what everyone is rating it, how can i when they aren't known for their pad thai or pad se ew which is some of my favorite dishes at my favorite thai restaurants. First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don't normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I'm going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain
Unassuming restaurant off the Strip.  The food was amazing.  Three of us shared the garlic fried jumbo prawns (the shells can be eaten like chips and they were the best part of a great meal!), pork jerky, crispy rice, roasted duck curry (had bits of fruit which wonderfully balanced the spicy curry), curry rad nah, and coconut ice cream w sticky rice.. . Every dish was good, with the garlic prawns and roasted duck curry as exceptional.  Bit pricey, nearly $30 a head for lunch, but so tasty that it is worth it.  Service was attentive and competent.
This place is def over-rated and way to expensive for Thai food. The claim is that it's the best Thai food in the country and that's not the case . We ordered the short rib panang, Isaan sausage, soft crab noodles, house fried rice and chicken salad. Although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish. I was expecting this place to blow my mind away but it was a major disappointment. $80 for 5 dishes is ridiculous.
I ate here a week ago and I have thought about the Nam Kao Tod every single day since dining here. Take me back.
Overhyped!!! Overpriced!!!  Food was kinda cold and the BBQ chicken was pink inside. "Raw". The worst part is that the servings are too small. For being the best Thai food in Vegas, it's pretty weak. The service is not that bad though.
Its very authentic, but I just cannot give it 5 stars, I have had better before.  I love an know my thai, love the service, love the wine, the drinks, the coconut ice cream with fried bananasa, the spicey northern style chicken noodle soup, the appetizer was my favorite, a larb like crispy rice dish with mint, lime, and the best little crunchy rices ever.   I give it a solid, 4, its really a 4.50 if I could cut it here, but its not 5 star yet.   The place is worth the trek to the most ghetto strip mall in Las Vegas Proper, I think it was built in the 50s, its crazy how much parking is in this lot for the number of shops, but its got some really good food in the strip mall.   The decor is classy and the glass wine cellar you can see from you seat with 1000+ bottles is pretty damn impressive.   4.5 Solid stars.   Get hungry , and go!  Spicey Thai with top line service!
Really good, but I like Archie's better. As a local, I was happy to see this place doing so extremely well!
I  come here any chance I can when I am in Vegas!!!!. You are supposed to get mostly northern Thai food but it is soooo spicy!. . Everything is YUM  . . Wait can get REALLY long at peak hours.  . . Again so good but it is very spicy.  . . Great for groups and they even have a sommelier.
This place is truly a hidden gem. My good friends always mention this place to me and told me I have to try this place out. I wasn't really impressed. Maybe I order the wrong items. I decided not to give up on this place and try it out again. I come to vegas around 4 times a year and this place is always on my list to hit up.. . I do recommend to always make reservations at least 1 week in advanced. Or you will be waiting for over an hour. I enjoy going with friends because you then get to try different items on the menu.. . Get the garlic shrimp! You won't get disappointed.
Always delicious! Fresh food, great service, great menu!
Blown away.  Seriously.  If you're looking for some sort of haute cuisine experience, you should probably look somewhere else, but if you want as-good-as-it-gets Thai, this is the place.  Don't be put off by the seedy exterior, get in line at about 5:15 p.m. and enjoy. . . Thanks Mr. Belushi for the recommend!
Wow! . I'm blown away by how great the food and service was ! I am deadly allergic to peanuts and it was nice that they even made our food with vegetable oil instead of peanut oil ! This place is a must go ! Service and food was on point and I'm definitely coming back :))
Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.. . I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.. . The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce. . After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.. . I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.. . Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.
This place definitely lives up to the hype! My friend and I were in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and planned to come here for lunch on our last day. During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas. Worth the cab ride from the strip and definitely worth the hype! :)
Excellent food.  Really helpful staff in explaining the different dishes.   The most amazing Thai food menu I have ever seen.  Also great wine cellar.
Wow I arrived here at 5 it opens at 5:30 already a line started and this was on a Tuesday. I usually eat white person thaiee food I was eating alone an ass for the recommendation from the waitress and was not let down
When we arrived at the restaurant it looked like a run down building with a few people standing outside. We were shocked when we went opened the door. The inside of the restaurant is actually nice and it was super packed. The wait for a table of 3 took 1 hour. Luckily we were able to leave and come back in an hour. It was definitely worth the wait. The food here is amazing! The best things we ordered were the Garlic prawns and the soft shelled crab salad. Next time I go to Vegas I will make sure I come back to eat those 2 amazing dishes.
Best Thai I've ever had.  Food and service was exceptional.  Upscale atmosphere with reasonable prices on food and wine.  . . Food +. Service +. Value + (for amazing food). Atmosphere +
I have to submit a warning to the true spicy - pan Asian food lovers, this does not offer the hyped experience. Italian wine, Chinese tea and sweet and sour chicken - really? Number 7 I use for new places delivered a # 2 weak punch. The duck was truly crispy- and jerky-like. Seafood drunken noodle had obviously frozen packaged mussel and squid - and large pieces of faux crab. Food was serviceable- but not special.
I was with the bf and two others visiting in Vegas for my birthday. When my friend told me we were going to eat here and then I saw it a few days later on Bourdain's show, I was pretty excited. . . I have to say, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, or as my friends were. We ordered dishes that Anthony ordered and I thought they were just ok. Nothing impressed me as much as the garlic prawns, which we ordered a second helping of because they were so good. . . The dishes from the show were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was pretty good and had pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also ordered the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. That was quite tasty. . . I just thought, that many of the thai places I've eaten at in San Diego and LA, were better than this. Maybe this is considered really good for Las Vegas? . . You could see a lot of people arriving in taxis and I even asked one of them if they had seen the show and they said yes. Bourdain has a LOT of influence on people, that's for sure. But this foodie was only mildly impressed.
First off. I came on a sunday around 7, alone. There was a wait for me of 30 mins. I didnt care because i wanted thai and didnt feel like waiting for another cab and taking it back to the strip. So i sat at the bar and enjoyed a singah until my name was called.. I like to judge Thai restaurants solely based off the peanut sauce when I order chicken satay. If I want to take a whole jar home, sit in front of the tv with a spoon and eat it, I know their food will be just as good. This place isn't an exception. It was right up on my "most favorite peanut sauce" list (yes, I have a list of good peanut sauce restaurants, don't judge me). . I ordered the chicken stay for an appetizer and na num tok or something...it was beef and beef makes me happy when I eat it. . I wasn't expecting a crap load of thai basil and cilantro (which I don't care for) being on the plate when presented.  I managed to eat it and still enjoyed it with the exception of the couple cilantro bites I got. Probably wont order it again, but I will deffinetly be back here my next vegas trip. Huge menu and lots of things to try!!
These days, thanks to sites like Yelp and television programs, restaurant hype is more prevalent than ever before.  Lotus of Siam has certainly benefited from positive coverage and word of mouth--just on my flight into Vegas, two groups seated next to me were talking about upcoming reservations.  But hype is a double-edged sword:  my expectations for my dinner were so high that nothing short of an unforgettable, "I'll be talking about this years from now," kind of meal was going to be good enough.  Amazingly, Lotus of Siam met those expectations, and then some.. . My extended family (party of 9) arrived at Lotus, and I immediately got ragged on--I am known for taking trips off the beaten path in pursuit of great meals, with mixed results, since most of my family generally favors "meat and potatoes" kind of establishments.  Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable.  Because we were warned that the restaurant does not hold reservations, we arrived 20 minutes early, and after a quick drink at the bar, we were seated.. . Let's start with drinks--Lotus has all the standard beers and liquors you might expect at a Thai restaurant, but also has a very impressive (and appropriate) wine list, with great options at every price point.  This was a nice, unexpected touch.  Service was quick and friendly, as well.. . As for the food, all I can say is that there was literally something for everyone:  the classics (Tom Kha, garlic prawns) that you can get at most Thai restaurants were made at a higher level.  There were outstanding vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat.  Some of the Northern Thai dishes were things I'd never seen before, and everything we tried (in particular, a green chili pepper dish) was a hit.  The curries were also universally delicious, and for those of you who like spice, rest assured that Lotus isn't afraid of adding real heat.  My brother joked that the menu was like the Cheescake Factory if it was good, and this is actually a pretty good analogy; it takes time to read through the encyclopedic menu and figure out what you're going to order, but at the end of the day, everything we chose was either very good or excellent.. . This was an incredible meal, and I will never make a trip to Vegas without stopping by.
My boyfriend and I tried this place because he saw it on that Anthony Bourdain show. Let me tell you, THE best Thai food hands down that I've ever had. We had the fish cake for appetizer. My boyfriend had the Northern larb (pork) & i had the roasted duck Curry..usually comes in red curry but I switched it for yellow curry. And oh my goodness...they were ALL super amazing!!! The staff was nice but could be more attentive. But nontheless...AMAZING PLACE!!!!!!
What to say about Lotus that hasn't already been said? Probably not much.. . 1. Location: Scary... Seriously. Don't bring your kids here after dark. Just about every other establishment in the strip-mall screams "stay away if you want to wake up with two kidneys tomorrow morning". . 2. Food: This is why this place gets 5 stars. This is Thai food that you won't find anywhere else. The Northern Thai specialties lend themselves to some dishes that will take you for a ride. Be adventurous. In my experience asking the waitstaff will lead them to just recommend you the regular "safe" stuff, so just pick one yourself. . . 3. Drink: A thai place with a better wine selection than an upscale Italian restaurant? Sure, why not? . . 4. Service. Havent been too impressed here - but to their credit they are ALWAYS packed and have to deal with tourists all night (this place may once have been a "hidden" gem, but it has most decidedly been found by the tourist crowd now). . All in all, this place lives up to its great reputation. Try it out.
Came here with a co-worker on a Tuesday night.  We tried to make a reservation but they were full, so we decided to an and wait for a table.  We were told it would be a 45-1hr wait, so we popped next door to grab a rink while we waited.. . Man, so glad we waited. The food was incredible! We had the chicken dumplings, pad see ew, massaman curry and the veggie fried rice. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. if you like Thai food this is a must while in Vegas.  In terms of location, it's a bit off the strip, a 7 min cab ride, and there is not much around it. The restaurant itself is very casual, and most of the clientele is Thai- that's how you know it's authentic.. . Overall it was a great experience. The only thing is that they only serve beer and wine, and I would have loved a cocktail, but it didn't take away from the experience at all.
This place is way overrated.  The food are not as good as how people described. We ordered the sea bass and there was only 5 tiny peices(2 inch wide and length) of the fish filet,  the rest was mostly vegetables(this dish cost $30!!).The food has a lot of msg and the dishes are not proportioned right. More vegetables than meat. So it's like eating vegetarian food. . . If anyone is from Atlanta, ga, thai Norcross is so much better. Don't waste your time standing in line for this place.. Waiters are not friendly and they are snobs.
We heard that it gets crowded on the weekends.  So, we went for lunch on a Friday.  Got there at 11:40.  Got seated right away.  Thank goodness we arrived early.  It was packed by the time we left.  We had the Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip).  It was ok.  More of a appetizer with veggies to dip.  The Garlic Prawns were light, crispy and full of flavor.  We definitely order that again.  The Crispy Duck Panage was also good.  We wished it had more curry sauce.  Overall, it was a great meal.  Skip the buffet and order off the menu.
the service staff is friendly and quick. the food is absolutely delicious. you have to get the crispy fried rice and their garlic black pepper prawns. there is a wait but it's not that bad even during busy times.
It's right off the strip and pretty easy to find. The shopping center is pretty dingy and run down but don't worry, you are in the right place.  Because most of the other shops are out of business,  there is plenty of parking. If you don't make a reservation, the wait can be pretty long. . . On to the positive things about it, lol. Like it's known for, there are a ton of pictures of famous people that have been there that line walls - my family enjoyed them. Our waiter was really nice and patient, he had to come around a couple times before we had of order ready. For the amount of food we ordered, it came out very quickly. You can tell they don't take any short cut with the food here, you can taste the quality of the ingredients and the layers of flavors in each dish. My mom and aunts are very good cooks and have cooked some of the same dishes before and they're very comparable - meaning it's got the homemade taste and quality to it, because the cooks in my family go all of and don't skimp on anything just to save money. And lastly, the food was very reasonably priced. We had a large group but it didn't cost as much as I'd anticipated.
Hmmm a bit pricey but totally worth it. The place was packed did not expect the place to be that great. The Garlic shrimp was really tasty deep fried topped with garlic sauce I think it  was fried at a high temp the prawns  became cracklings you can eat the whole shrimp. Combination fried rice was different from Archi's a bit more salty not so sweet. . . The northern Dish we tried however which is the eggplant with minced pork had a totally different flavor profile from the other thai resto's we tried locally in Vegas.  The dessert with mango and sticky rice had a unique flavor coconut milk with a tinge of chamomile or lavender were still discussing what they added which was a total surprise. . . The whole Dining experience was really good. We will definitely come back for the other northern dishes and Chefs special on special occasion which is coming soon. For Vegas PEEPS as well as Visitors out of the country and out of STATE definitely a must try!!!
Just about everything is yummy here and the staff is attentive. . . Best dishes: . Garlic prawns - super tasty and the shells are nicely seasoned and has a good crunch to it. . Tom yum koong - the soup was not hot enough but the flavors were there. Tangy and spicy. There was also plenty of shrimps. . . We also had to meat salad, duck, drunken noodle, and basil fried rice. Everything was made well. . . Try to make a reservation when you're coming on a weekend night. This place gets packed! . . If you're waiting for a table, check out the bar in the back.
Not really impressed with the service.  When my husband called for reservation, he was told no reservation.  When we arrived, I saw hostess on the phone taking reservation, and they have a reservation book.  Make me to leave right away.
Wow. Amazing!!! we had pad Thai,pad see ew, garlic prawn, mussels. Everything was delicious!  Nothing went wrong. Their customer service is great! Nothing to complain about this place!
The best Thai food period. We ordered the lobster, and pad se ew. Not our usual garlic shrimp which is also to die for.  I have not had a bad meal at this one of a kind joint. The waiters and waitress are very attentive. It seems like they are happy to serve you great food.
This place is BUSY! but hot dang the good was delicious! So clean and delicious! I loved it! Very happy! I am definitely coming here again when I come to Vegas.
Great thai place! The wait wasnt too bad. The location is not as shady as some people might think as this is a mom&pop looking place. . . I loved the extensive wine list. Try the auslese if you like sweet wine that is not necessarily dessert wine. . . The best panang curry ive had yet. Portion sizes were good, not too small for price and not too much where youd have to take home. . . Our server wasnt the greatest though. Was not attentive at all. He took forever on everything and i had to wave my hand to get his attention. There were times when he wasnt to be found and others had to pick up his slack.
we chose this restaurant because it was rated the #1 Thai restaurant on Yelp and it was recommended by people we know who actually live in Vegas.  . . we heard about the long line to get in so we decided to call and make a reservation for the very same day.  they said they were all booked for reservations but the wait shouldn't be that long....so we just planned on driving to the restaurant and hoping for the best.  we went on a Thursday (today) and were in the parking lot at 5:15 (doors open at 5:30).  there was already a small line forming, 3 parties ahead of us.  by the time the doors opened, there was about 30 people in line.  we don't normally eat this early but didn't want to miss our chance at getting seated sooner than later.  we were seated right away (party of 2) :)  . . yes, the reviews are true, it's looks like a hole in the wall on the outside butonce inside you will be immediately relieved.  hey, any restaurant that has a line of people outside waiting to get in has to be good, right? right!. . we ordered 2 appetizers: garlic/black pepper chicken wings and the tom yum kai soup (cup size).  wouldn't get the wings again because they weren't garlicky or peppery enough for us but they had a good crunchiness to them.  the soup was fantastic, i got it # 5 in spiciness and it definitely had a kick.  our 4 mains included: pad thai (chicken), we both agreed it was the best pad thai ever.  thai fried rice (chicken), we both agreed it was a little bland for fried rice and would not order it again.  green curry w/chicken, it was very, very good and would certainly order it again.  garlic prawns that everyone raves about (i don't eat prawns but i made my husband order them) and he thought they were awesome, although a little pricey (21.95). . . we did not order any alcohol or dessert.  our bill came to about $68.00 before tip.  needless to say, we had leftovers to bring with us.. . the service was friendly and FAST.  the waiters were very attentive at refilling our water glasses and clearing away our plates.  . . this restaurant is definitely worth it.  the reason why i am only giving it 4/5 is because we thought the food could have been a little hotter (temperature wise).. . Bon Appetite!!
I've been here a few times. It's really pricy for a Thai restaurant but the food speaks for itself.. . The dishes are really really good with the exception of their curries. I'm just not a fan of them. It doesn't pop out to me.. . The menu highlights to me are the thai beef salad, crispy duck, deep fried catfish, braised short rib, and tom kha kai.. . I'll be going back a few more times as well.
Probably the best Thai food I've had in a long time.  The stuffed chicken wings were awesome. The garlic prawns, outta this world.  The crispy duck, to die for.  Wasn't the biggest fan of the Tom yum soup. , I've heard a lot about this place and all good things. I would have to agree and will be back here for sure.
I don't have too many great things to say about my last girlfriend except that she introduced me to Lotus of Siam. I had heard for several years that many food critics claim it has the best Thai food in America, and this place definitely lives up to the hype. . . I've been a Vegas resident for over a decade and dined at almost every high-end restaurant in town, but this is easily one of my favorite spots in the city. There are something like 130 or 140 menu items to choose from and the prices are incredibly reasonable -- especially considering how popular this place is. It's not remotely fancy inside and the location is in a dirty shopping center in a bad part of town, but the food is unbelievably exceptional. . . Reservations are definitely recommended if you want to eat on a weekend evening at a preferable dining hour, but don't give up if you call ahead and the receptionist says they're booked. Simply walk in around 9-9:15 (they close at 10) and you probably won't wait for more than 20 minutes or so. Ask the receptionist and she'll tell you the same thing.. . And if you're looking for some cheap after-dinner entertainment, I suggest sitting in your car for a few minutes and checking out the people coming and going from "The Green Door" (the supposedly world famous swingers club inside the same shopping center). The people watching from the parking lot there is almost as great as the food at Lotus of Siam. Enjoy!
Best Thai food outside of Thailand. My go to dishes are crispy duck with Thai basil, garlic prawns, pork larb salad, and the House special catfish. Try to come for lunch, or right when they open or before they close, because peak time will be over an hour wait.
My partner had to make reservation to eat at this joint and it took him three attempts. It looks like a regular restaurant from the outside but it opens up as you go into the restaurant which was a little more pleasant. . . It's very crowded and the servers continuously bump our chairs when they have plenty of space to walk around us. Overrated and this food can be purchase at any Thai restaurant. Not worth the hassle.
Orderd the drunken shrimp noodles, the pad thai, the Nam Kao Tod.. . The num kao tod is amazing. It has so many interesting flavors. The acid is a bit strong at first; but as it subsides you'll see that you can't stop eating it as you discover more and more different flavors: the cilantro, mint, lemon, the crunchy ricelike, etc.. . The drunken noodles with shrimp is an amazing dish. It comes with several fried crunchy prawns and this flat noodle that's been cooked and has so many different flavors: sweet, salty, umami, etc.
