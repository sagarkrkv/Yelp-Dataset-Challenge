We went to Delmonico's in the Palazzo/Venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  While nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  The service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  . . This is an Emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  I started with the Ahi and Salmon Tartare.  A nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.  . . The rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  . . Overall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.  There are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in Vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  . . Interestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no Delmonico steak on the menu.  I thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)
One of the best places I have dined at! Everything here is delicious! Oscar style w/ Filet Mignon is super good!
Absolutely fantastic service, fantastic food, and wonderful atmosphere!  We will be back, without a doubt!
Located at the Venetian Hotel and a Emeril Lagasse establishment. I made reservations for four persons BC our vendor wanted to treat us to dinner.. . We started off with drinks at the beautiful bar and made our way to the plush dinning area. I started off with the gumbo which was superb. For dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  For sides we enjoyed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, NOLA creamed spinach and for dessert I savored the a entire Emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). My co worker from Phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about. . . This was definitely a meal that was memorable and thank you to the entire staff at Delmonico Steakhouse. It's great knowing I can get a solid NOLA influenced meal with having to go to NOLA!
T me Delmonicos earns a five star rating for two reasons.  For one, I've never had a bad experience eating there... Their food and service has always exceeded my expectations.  Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!  For a quick recommendation, try their filet mignon, duck or ask for their filet medallions, it is off the menu but the flavor is amazing.. .

My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, "Yes".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.
My friends hyped this place up so much this time in Vegas that I walked in with super high expectations, which unfortunately did not hold.. . While the service was great, so were the breads, their cocktails were nothing to write home about and their wine selection was rigid - I had the Hemingway drink and it was alright.. . The food was good - I had the tuna which was really good on itself, but the sauce was terrible. The sides were not bad. Our server really hyped up the creamed corn, which came much later and I did not see what the big deal was about. It was again just ok.. . The desserts were pretty good, our table enjoyed them. I ordered the bread pudding ala mode and having had the some spectacular bread puddings recently, I did not think this was anything amazing but still not bad.. . One thing to mention though - because our server had forgotten our last side order, it was on the house. tells you alot about the quality of service at this place.. . I probably will try out other options on the strip before coming back here. Given that it's Vegas, there are some really good options. Unfortunately Delmonico wasn't a super memorable experience for me, but for a well-made dinner in a nice restaurant, this place is spot on.
My husband and I have enjoyed Emeril's restaurants. But when we tried Delmonico's, it was unbelievable. We had the best meal ever. It's worth the money. I think it's the best of all Emeril's restaurants. I have no more words, speachless. You all should to try it.
Beautiful restaurant, thoughtful staff. Some of the best food I have ever had plus kick ass cocktails. My only complaint is not their fault. We are only in vegas for 2 nights and i see a food coma in my future.
This was a great venue to have some dinner and enjoy the company of friends.  Located in restaurant row in the Venetian, this place is an Emeril restaurant that features steaks and sides of high quality.  . . A few of my party actually shared the rib eye because it was a really bit cut of meat.  That combined with the great sides made a wonderful meal.  Service was impeccable as our waiter and other staff were engaged and always on top of what we needed.. . For sides, I'd suggest the grits and bacon.  I ate the whole side dish and barely shared with others.  The creamed corn was surprisingly good and the brussels were also really good.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake which came in a jar which was terribly good.  We also had the chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I didn't try too much of that as I was stuck digging my spoon in the strawberry shortcake. . . For a great balance of food and service, I highly recommend.
