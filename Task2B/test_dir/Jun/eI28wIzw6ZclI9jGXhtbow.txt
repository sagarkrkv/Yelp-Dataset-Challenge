I have been dying to see this show for a long time and it was recommended to me as a "must see". I have to say it is the best show I have seen in a very long time. The venue is intimate and bohemian, none of the chairs match and the decor is dark and smoky feeling. Kinda like your in a place you shouldn't be all adding to the mystique of what you are about to see. . . The actual show is AMAZING! it is very raunchy and inappropriate with foul language and very dirty jokes! The performers are brilliant and talented with great choreography. The acrobatics are flawless and every one of the performers was perfect physically. Every woman in my group had a crush on every single, chiseled male performer. . . The acts themselves were quite impressive. Tigh rope walking, spinnig rollerskates, trapeze artists, aerial dancing, etc. The host and hostess are hysterical! They even do a comedy skit together with the hopes that you won't know it's them LOL Do not sit in the front row if you don't want to be called out and become a part of their terribly politically incorrect humor. No one group is spared in their profane tirades; It's great!. . I recommend this show to everyone I meet with the warning that they need to be able to take a joke. It's not for children or the faint of heart. You will be thoroughly entertained and walk out thinking "What the heck just happened?!" in way more inappropriate words LOL
Funny. I see some reviews that say it's way better than a Cirque show. I'm not sure what Cirque shows they have been watching as acrobatically/thematically I have seen Cirque shows that have been exquisite. That being said, this was a more mature show filled with more comedy and still amazing acrobatics. I would highly recommend seeing the show if in the area. While I didn't find the show in the least bit offensive, I guess one could. I guess if you've ever been "offended" in the past by something someone said--stripping blatant racist homophobic remarks by people--than you might be by this. Although, both of those might be present in this show but it's under the guise of no one gets off the hook. It's fun--great night.
I've never given a show a 5-star rating before, but I have no choice with Absinthe.  It actually deserves more stars!  This is the one show in Vegas that I will go back to see again!. . First of all, I recommend you get a Reserved B seat at one of the small tables in the back.  You'll have a small table to put your drink on, plus you have comfortable seating room.  All the seats closer to the stage are small folding chairs positioned shoulder-to-shoulder and we could see that they are very uncomfortable.  The show venue is so small you can see fine from anywhere, we could probably see the aerial acts and the high-wire acts better from the back than those people sitting up close could see them. . . The acrobatic acts and the gymnastic acts are amazing!  I have no words to describe them, you have to see for yourself.  Just incredible athletes and performers!  . . Between acts, the emcees throw in a lot of adult-oriented jokes, some of which were  funny and some of which were "groaners" and somewhat juvenile.  I guess they have to fill up the time between acts somehow.. . Highly recommended!
My fiance and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and, upon seeing a lot of great reviews on this site, decided to give this show a try. We were hoping for a bit of an adult show and from the reviews, this seemed like the one to try.. . The seats were about $100-110, but if you walk by the tent, they hand out coupons for 20% off, so I think our tickets were roughly $90 each. We decide to see the later show because we were hoping that the crowd would be a bit drunker and a bit more engaging.. . We show up and walk into this tent that has a single circular stage in the middle (roughly 12' in diameter) and there's a large curtain covering the stage. The atmosphere inside the tent is rather cool, but then we see our seats. They have crammed so many people into this tent that you might as well be sitting on someone's lap. My fiance didn't mind as much, but I'm a bit broader in the shoulders and could not sit up straight because I felt wedged between my fiance and the guy next to me. . . The show starts with a rather cool balancing act and song. I will say that their acts were rather impressive, however, there were literally only about 6 of them. Most of it was commentary from the host and his assistant.. . As everyone on here has said, the show is crude. The host basically found a few people in the audience that fit into a stereotype and picked on them all night. The main problem I had with the entire show was the humor (or lack thereof). Neither me, nor my fiance, were ever offended and we are regularly accused of making crude jokes, so don't think that we don't appreciate crude humor. The problem was the lack of depth with the humor. It was very similar to back in high school when someone learns how to curse, so to get a cheap laugh out of their friends, they'd talk about sex, throw a few f-bombs in there, and then wait for people to laugh. It was incredibly shallow and basically crude for the sake of being crude.. . Honestly, halfway through I was hoping it was almost over, but sat through it since I'd already paid almost $200 for us to see this show. I'm not sure how others are rating this as high as they are, but it was quite the waste of money. I'd rather have spent it at a Cirque show or even gambling.
I found this show based on the reviews online and the suggestion that it was a little different.. . Hilarious jokes told unapologetic ally at the expense of the audience, singing, and amazing physical/acrobatic acts. The physical feats were definitely what I found to be the most impressive with amazing dancing, balancing, and displays of strength.. . Seats are a little cozy and you'll be quite close to your neighbors.. . Very entertaining and recommended!
So.. Pros:. The show was amazing. Every single act was spectacular and amazing.. . Cons:. The MCs were TERRIBLE. I noticed from the Yelp pictures: there is definitely more than one actor who plays The Gazillionaire. The man in the show I saw was not the same man in all the promotional material/photos. Maybe the other actor does a much better job. I have no way of knowing.. . He and his assistant went straight past funny into just-plain-racist and unfunny sex jokes. This would have fine if they were clever, or entertaining at all, but you can't just drop f-bombs a lot and talk about sex and make racist comments and call it humor.  There were one-liners coming from members of the crowd that were more entertaining than the MCs of the show.. . Like other reviewers have said, it's like a grade-school kid who just found out if he says enough crude things, eventually someone will laugh. . . So I guess: if I could do it over again, I would try and find out ahead of time who is taking the role of The Gazillionaire that night. (if that's even possible). Try and find a night when it's not the "understudy".
Saw this show last month w/ a business associate.  Wonderful!  . . It's irreverent, hilarious, entertaining and fun. A modern and hip vaudeville.  Don't miss it.
Pros - Good acrobatic acts. . . Cons - I don't know where to begin. But here are some. 1. The worst part of the show is all the jokes are targeted at the audience. Every joke belongs at least to one of the following categories - Racism, Gay, Blonde, SugarDad ( (even if they are regular same age couple),etc. . The The Gazillionaire (host) picks randomly his target, mostly the people sitting in the front seats or at the table. He talks about how theyhave sex at night...how ugly they are....how they are dressed up..etc. The light will be focused on that person and they get humiliated to the 'n'th degree, while everyone is laughing at their expense. . . I felt like this guy never had friends in his life. Not sure whether to laugh to some of these crude jokes or not.. . In one show, they picked up a lady and two guys (of course one guy is black..his favorite target). Asked the lady to sit on the stage. Asked both guys to give lap dance and the lady to pick up the best lap dancer. The lady will touch the winner's private parts....while her husband is watching.. . Out right disgusting to watch this unwrap up right in front of your own eyes.  The lady and the 2 guys were very reluctant to do this act. They were forced to do this.. And the black guy's daughter was watching his father perform this lap dance and the lady touching his private parts. Awesome.. . Is this what we pay more than 100 dollars for?. . 2. I was sitting in the regular seats. The seats were way too small. Very uncomfortable.. . 3. Did I say all jokes are nasty and very personal? . . 4. Expensive for one hour show.. . 5. The stage is too small for those crazy acts. Spectators safety is at the lowest level. Maybe none.. . Also watched Cirque 'O' show (in Bellagio). Great Classy Acts. That's why they run the Cirque O show in Bellagio's auditorium and this Absinthe show runs in tent outside Caesar's Palace.. . If you still think you will enjoy this disgusting show.....go ahead. Check yourself.. If you get picked on by the host, everyone will be laughing at your expense.
Saw this show on Sunday. It was amazing! I was so impressed. It was not only hilarious, but mesmerizing. All of the acts brought something unique to the table! I HIGHLY recommend seeing this if you are in vegas. You will not regret it!
Loved this show. My date and I agreed it was just the right amount of crazy, sexy & hilarious! The VIP entrance made us feel like undercover superheroes.  Seats are a little tight, but it's fun to be close and laughing with strangers :P
OMG hands down, the best show in vegas filled with sex, humour, and so much fun! They have crowd interaction too so I wouldn't sit in the front. I loved it and have seen the show twice.  . . Second time I brought my bf for his birthday and they called him on stage, it was so awesome. I had quite a few glasses of wine so It was even funner.
Five stars just isn't enough! If you are debating between this or a cirque show, go to Absinthe.  Although I should mention that the humor is best for adults.  The performers are spectacular and the comedy had us all cracking up the entire show.  The tent is small so don't worry about getting a good seat.  Penny is my favorite and our large group of 6 had a great time.  We stayed in Caesars so it was right outside and convenient as well.  Would highly recommend, was worth every penny.
Funny as hell , a bit raunchy , in a cool way , not for kids ,it's not in Ceasars Building but in a tent next door.
I don't understand why this show is rated so highly at 4.5 stars.. . I have seen several other shows, such as Love, O, Le Reve, Ka, and Mystere, and maybe I've been spoiled by them.  Don't get me wrong..  the acrobatic acts in Absinthe are good, and a couple are pretty amazing.  There's a couple decent singing bits, too, made arguably more enticing by the singer stripping down to her pasties.  But these pros are not good enough to outweigh the cons of this show.. . The problems with Absinthe are all related to the Gazillionaire and Penny characters.  They're the comedy portion of the show, interspersed between acts, but they're just not funny.  I chuckled a handful of times, but that's about it.  As such, they took up way too much time.. . Maybe everyone calling them funny was drunk, or maybe they didn't want to seem unhip or too much a prude to say that the jokes just weren't that funny.  Jokes about racial stereotypes and gay people can be hilarious if done right, but their approach was to just beat you over the head with unapologetic crudeness.  Where's the humor in that if you're older than, say, a middle schooler, or if you've spent like a week's worth of time on the internet?  It was cringeworthy.  Just take a bunch of jokes about stereotypes that you've already heard, project them onto unwitting members of the audience, be really loud and obnoxious, and voila, hilarious comedy routine?  No.  Not hilarious.  You're doing a disservice to the other acts in the show, stop it.. . The whole "get two random guys up here to give a lapdance to another random girl" bit was painful, too.  The more I think of it, the more I feel that there's just no freakin point to this show.  No story, just bad humor ruining everything.  There was another bit where Penny uses two dolls from her therapy to illustrate a sexual encounter between her and one of the show performers.  There was another bit about a unicorn with a huge black penis as a horn, and somehow it is jizzing everywhere.  The whole idea was to take themes too far.  We get it, you "went there", but "going there" isn't enough to stand on.. . Anyway, pass on this show.  If you still decide to see it, just know that it's not actually inside Caesars Palace, but just outside the main lobby, in a tent.
The best show in vegas. Spring for VIP seats close to the center.... Crude, Sexually Explicit, great performers (better than some others), and VERY funny. . . The atmosphere is second to none, we may come back next visit to sin city.. . Trust everyone on yelp and go!
The BEST show to go outside of the Casino.  You get an up close front view anywhere you sit.  All the performers are Amazing and Very talented (especially the hosts). It is a variety of Singing, Dancing, Acrobat, Comedy, Strip Tease, Cirque Du Soleil. I'd see it again. A must see show!
Great show, it had me on the edge of my seat laughing the entire time, awesome skill the cast has!!!
Love love love Absinthe. Raunchy, daring and pushes the envelope on all matters.  This show is not for the faint of heart or anyone who is offended easily.  Luckily we fit neither of those bills.. . You are literally under "the big top" and feel as if you have stepped back into the 1920's.  From moment to finish we were laughing and on the edge of our seats.  Amazing acrobatics and stunts and knee slapping humor.. . We recommend this show to anyone and everyone headed to Vegas - it is an absolute must!
This show is in VEGAS. It is an ADULT show. So if that is an issue for you DON'T GO !! YOU WILL HATE IT. If you came to Vegas to get down, YOU WILL LOVE IT. It does have some really classic moments that are fall out of your chair funny. PENNY is one demented little lassie that is absolutely WONDERFUL. It also has MANY talented acts that are not part of the Adult/Vegas part of the show that showcase some truly amazing talents. LOVED every minute !! Bad news: Chairs are small, not very comfortable and close together which makes the whole place very cozy. One of the BEST shows in Vegas and I have seen ALL of the headliner Cirque de Solei and major run shows they have here. If you want to laugh and have a great time check it out.
I enjoyed all parts of this show.  The singing/dancing, the acrobatic acts and the comedy.  Seeing the acts close up make them much more impressive.  Some apparently do not think much of the sophomoric humor, but I liked it (no I was not drunk).  . . The seats were probably the worst part.  Metal folding chairs, but it's supposed to be part of the charm.  The show also felt a little short, and I learned that they may have lost (or gotten rid of) one of the performers, so maybe it used to be a bit longer.  . . I highly recommend the show.
