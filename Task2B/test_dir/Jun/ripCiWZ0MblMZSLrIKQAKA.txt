Look - if you aren't staying at the Bellagio, or the absolute NEWEST hotel in Vegas, then you shouldn't expect 5 star service! Monte Carlo delivered as far as price goes.. . We got the rooms somewhere around $80-100 a night, over memorial day weekend. It was our first time in Las Vegas.. . The Good:. . 1) This part will also show up in my "bad" section, but we were given two queens our first night, after having reserved a king. The view from the queen room, at the end of a very quiet hallway on the 30th floor, was amazing! So we never asked to be placed in the king we initially asked for. I don't think you'll get a bad view in this hotel if you get a higher level room.. . 2) There is SO MUCH TO DO in the hotel itself. We had a hard time leaving, actually. So many restaurants, with great variety, as far as type of food, service, and price go. Starbucks for a quick pick-me-up, Sambalatte for a casual latte. McDonalds for a quick fry, The Cafe for an upscale diner-like experience. There's literally everything you'll ever need in this hotel.. . 3) The pool. We weren't looking for noise, so we sat at the very far left, near the hot tub/actual pool, and far away from the wave pool. Yes, you can hear the music on the speakers here ("club" music started at noon every day), but its HALF as quiet (if not more) than sitting elsewhere in the area where the DJ is. We would walk up to get drinks and go, wow, how is it so quiet where we are over there but so loud at the bar?!. . 4) LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! MonteCarlo is in one of the best spots on the strip, ever. If nothing else, stay here for the location.. . The Bad:. . 1) Yeah, we reserved a king and got a room with two double-beds. They should honor the reservation, but kings are "first come first serve" and we checked in at 10pm on a Wednesday night. Nonetheless, they texted us the following day saying our king was available, but we enjoyed our view and room location so much that we didn't bother to switch.. . 2) When we checked in late, there was food on the floor. Crumbs, ramen noodles dried up near the bed, etc. Very visible. We didn't complain because we figured housekeeping would get it in the morning, but they didn't. So we had to call housekeeping and tell them about the food. After this, they cleaned it up very promptly and our room was always in good condition. You're not getting housekeeping service like you'd get in a Hilton, but we never felt "dirty" in our room after that (aside from the food incident).. . 3) It's not a 5 star. Maybe not even a 4. Yes, the furniture is "tired" (I hate this saying) but THE PLACE IS CHEAP! There are some nicks on the furniture, the decor is a little lacking and old, but it was not unpleasant at all.. . 4) ITS THE YEAR 2014, MAKE WIFI FREE IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM, EVERY SINGLE FLOOR! UP THE TECHNOLOGY - IF I CAN CHECK-OUT FROM MY TELEVISION, I SHOULD GET WIFI. . . Overall, we'd stay here again. It fits our budget. It had everything we needed. It was very pleasant!
So the Monte Carlo has recently been renovated. This hotel is a great moderately priced hotel and the renovations make it look a little nicer than it did before. . . The hotel is pretty central strip. It's in between Aria and New York and right across from MGM. The hotel is pretty nice and the staff is good. We had no problems checking in or out. . . There was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase. This was a minor problem with us. because we didn't want our things being gone through which is why we had the sign up. But it appears that the sign was ignored. . . Other than that, it's a nice hotel. It's not the Bellagio but it's not Harrah's. It's a nice room that is in between the two in regards to luxury.
They aren't the worst hotel on the strip, and they certainly aren't the best either. I can't say it's really worthy of the Monte Carlo name considering nothing about it really stands out. I try and stay at a different hotel every time I go to Vegas. So far I've stayed at 7 of the hotels on the strip, though my stays tend towards the middle of the pack so that's mostly what I'm comparing the Monte Carlo to. . . I rated it 3 stars because as it says on yelp, it's A-OK. Nothing really stands out to me. The room is your average Vegas room, the Casino is decent but not too special. I guess the casino is a little better for me because I'm not a high roller and unless I'm doing pretty well or feeling particularly risky/drunk I try and stay below $15 a bet. . . The Monte Carlo does have a pretty good location so it has that going for it. It's pretty easy to get everywhere from the Monte Carlo. It's certainly not run down which is good in my opinion since it seems like a lot of the older hotels are starting to get neglected. Maybe because the economy is picking back up they're able to focus more on revitalizing everything. When I stayed they were doing a small revamp of the outside of the Hotel. . . I didn't think the restaurants seemed like anything too special and their buffet doesn't seem to be rated too well. Having said that though, you can get their buffet for really cheap at Tix 4 Tonight so if you're looking for a cheap meal this might be it. I may be confusing it with some other Hotel though so don't quote me on it. . . Overall, like the rating says, it's A-OK, making it midrange and a decent value for the price.
My family and I went here for New Year's 2013 celebration and ended up having my cell phone fried by their after-market, alarm clock, charger.  Besides the fast food court, the restaurants are overrated and overpriced - nothing spectacular.  .    We were also disappointed because they don't have or no longer have their own brewery, which we were looking forward to.  To me, it's just another fancy looking hotel that is overcharging customers and not taking care of their needs and complaints in a proper and professional manner; I waited months for them to tell me that they did an investigation and found they were not responsible for frying my phone.  They didn't even want phone records to prove my phone was working the day I got there and that I wasn't using it for days after it got fried.  .    We also spent hundreds gambling and didn't have "any luck" whatsoever.  Overall, a disappointing and extremely expensive New Year's Eve in Las Vegas!!!  Don't ever plan on going back!!!. . . U.S. Consumer
This place is horrible, book somewhere else! Customer service here is non Existent! From dirty rooms to rude front desk manager, my stay here was dreadful!
Monte Carlo was all I hoped it would be. A nice place to stay, nice pool, dining options for all times of the day and moods, and convenient place on the strip.. . If you want a spot at the pool on the weekends, be sure to head down there early. The lazy river gets jammed with people standing and socializing around noon, so if you want to take a lap on a tube on the weekends, also be sure to get that in right when you get there. . . Having McDonald's for coffee and a breakfast sandwich in the morning was awesome to start the day of right. You can't bring food into the pool because they sell some inside, but you can bring your coffee!. . Lots of other dining options, a few bars, and stores to shop in.. . I won't only book with the Monte Carlo, but if there were two possible options with the same yelp ratings, I would stay here again.
Nice lazy river\pool, friendly staff, comfy beds, spacious rooms. Wish the windows opened a little more though... not the worst hotel on the strip and reasonable for the price
Stayed at the Monte Carlo for the 6th time at least! Everything was great. Room was clean and ready when we arrived. The remodeling there doing out front is awesome. They have live music outside on the deck also they added some very good new eateries. Will surely stay there again and again!
Everyone is so friendly with the exception of the gentleman that checked us in he was quite short and rude when checking us in....got to room tv unplugged alarm clock unplugged room had a terrible odor to it possibly could be carpet with big huge stains all over it...called and complained that nothing was working and the room stunk they offered to send up housekeeping . . As for the reason that it's not a 1 star is everyone else was so friendly from table games to concierge desk to waitresses (although my wife played slots and nobody came by for drinks maybe because they don't tip?) eh think next time I will splurge and stay at Aria everyone rants and raves about them lesson learned
I have stayed here 3-4 times have had a solid 4 stars every time. . The rooms are clean and nice....The pool area (especially the lazy river) are good ( a bit crowded on summer weekends, but heck, its summer at a Vegas pool!). . The restaurants are good and the location of the hotel is awesome!. . The price is also good (best deal for a good hotel in the middle of everything!. . Not a 5 star, but a solid 4 stars. . I would and will stay there again!!!  Thank you Monte Carlo!! See you again in the future
My first time going to vegas so I booked with them since my friends stayed there. We bought the early check in and when we get there at 8 am , lady tells us just come by 9 and pick up keys your room will be ready. Come back at 9 there's a huge line, waited in line about 30 mins, the rude and unprofessional lady (her name was kathy) short hair called us over, no greetings,  she tells us we do not have any room available,  I was shocked. What do you mean, I just came here an hour ago all was good. And weirdly all other guests who were being helped by other staff were getting a room and seemed happy. Kathy told us to come back in one hour but room is not guranteed, so if there's not a room ready, she Will refund the money and basically we are screwed and have to find ourselves different hotel. Wtf.. told her no I paid early check in so I want my room by 10 not another hour,  she said ok check back, worst customer service. She is ruining the reputation of monte carlo. And I wasn't the only guest unhappy with her that time. We came back and we made sure to go back to different person not kathy, and we got our room with no hassle.  Even the staff was shocked that kathy sent us away to wait for a "IF" available room.. two stars because the room was decent and served it's purpose.
This review will be mostly written regarding the staff.  Everyone we encountered was super friendly.   From the restaurants to the Bathrooms and pool.   Our house keeping staff greeted us every morning.  We had a broken lamp which she called maintenance to take care of before we even had a chance.  When they didn't get it fixed the first day she found us to apologize and tell us she had called again.  The pool servers, although there didn't seem to be very many of them, were very helpful with picking out the right drink and bringing buckets and ice to make sure the drinks didn't get too warm in the heat.   As far as the hotel itself - it needs work.  The rooms are pretty beat up and could use some TLC. For the most part the room was clean and sufficient.  Let's face it, who spends much time in their rooms in Vegas, but it could still use something.
For what we paid, this was good value. I've paid much more for a comparable room at Caesars Palace, so I was happy here. I've outlined the pros and cons below. We just had a one-night stay (Thursday), but for $48 plus resort fee (MLife rate) it was worthwhile. The room was simple, but spacious. The furnishings were a bit dated and worn, but it was fine.  The hotel's branding calls it "Unpretentiously Luxurious." Depending on your perception of luxury, that is a pretty fair slogan.. . On the meh side, the HD tv featured no HD channels. The shower is not well lit, but the bathroom was clean and functional. The check-in took about 30 minutes in  line and there were only 3 or 4 employees manning the desks, though there were stations for something like 15. If you are MLife gold or higher, look for the VIP services on the edge of the lobby toward the casino to check in.. . We were upgraded to a Strip View room (27th floor of 32). The view of the Strip was minimal; you'll be mostly looking across to MGM Grand and Signature along with some of the lowest rent shops along the strip, or you'll be looking north at the towering Mandarin Oriental which blocks any view further up the Strip. I should have taken a photo to show you, but I didn't even think about it because it was so unremarkable. It was not a view worth paying for, but again, our upgrade was free. If this will be your first trip to Las Vegas and you really want a nice view of the Strip, look for another hotel.. . My biggest complaint was that the people on our floor were loud in the hallways in the middle of the night. Yeah, it's Vegas, but have some decency. That's what I get for trying to stay on a cheap rate, I guess.. . The best part was the pool. With a lazy river and a wave pool, you get a lot of options. The pool wasn't massive, but it needn't be. The water temperature was nice and the music was good. A DJ came in the afternoon and she mixed good songs but didn't become the center of attention of our afternoon at the pool.. . The casino offers some $5 blackjack tables near the food court which is a nice option for the risk-averse or the parsimonious Yelper. Most of the other tables were $10 or $15, I think.. . The Cafe was a good lunch spot for not too much coin. I had a nice ham and cheese sandwich with salt and vinegar chips and my wife enjoyed her meal, too. I can't remember what it was, but she liked it. Food here counts toward MLife points. It didn't seem to count at the Dragon Noodle house, but that was another good lunch option. The lunch specials are cheap but the food quality was much better than Panda Express.. . Though the view in our room was meh, the hotel's location is good to many other hotels. You can catch the tram for a quick ride up to Bellagio if you're in the mood for something fancier.  With the cheap room rate and convenience to other hotels, this would be a good place to stay on the cheap if you want to spend your money on nice dinners and/or shows. There are cheaper hotels in the MLife family, but they get really, really sketchy (Luxor, Excalibur). Mirage or Mandalay Bay would be a notch up from Monte Carlo.. . Another random note: Monte Carlo is one of the easiest to access from Las Vegas Blvd. That is, the driveway is not as complicated. This was a good advantage for us because my brother (a local) picked us up when he got back into town for the weekend. Also, being on the south end of the Strip makes it a  pretty quick to/from the airport.
I do hate to rip on places, but I recently stayed at the Monte Carlo in Vegas and I have a few things to say about it.  . . First, I'll point out that it's cheaper than most places on the strip, there's a McDonald's inside in the food court (great for breakfast and when you don't want to spend $80 on dinner), and the casino is pretty good.  Also, the location of the MC, with the help of the tram, is pretty darn good.  All of these things make for at least 3 stars. . . However, having stayed at a bunch of other hotels on The Strip, this place was the worst from a room comfort perspective.  The rooms were built in the 80s or something and they certainly show it.  There are cracks and mold in the bathroom tile, the showers aren't great, the carpet is stained, and the fixtures are way out-dated.  I guess I'm a bit of a snob, but I couldn't see past all of that.  I stayed here for a few nights and then stayed at the Bellagio for a few nights, and the difference in comfort level is pretty staggering - to me.  . . If you don't care about the details and are on a budget, the MC is probably a good place for you.
Nice staff and was reasonably priced. However some of the furniture has seen some better days, it could use some updating.
I really see nothing so wrong with Monte Carlo. It is in the middle of new Las Vegas, near City Center/ Vdara/ Cosmo/Aria. So you're in PRIME location of vegas, without that PRIME location price. . . Didn't have any issues with my room, all the concierge/room service people were very friendly!. . The only issue we had was that when our room wasn't ready, they told us to give them our number and they would text us when our room is ready. We got that text TWICE for two different room numbers, and we got that second text once we already dropped our stuff off at the first room , went to a pool party ... etc. So we were a little stressed about our keys not working later, people walking into our room with our stuff. that didn't happen, but still whats up with that text?!
I'm beginning to really like this place. It's clean, the service is outstanding. Especially John at the VIP check in. Their buffet is way more tasty than the Luxor or Excalibur and the same price. My favorite thing is the parking situation. You don't have to weave through the casino to get to your your room.. . I come to Vegas every other week for work and this has become my go to place.
worst hotel i have stayed in in Vegas. Checked in room was to small no biggie we'll up grade. Called the front desk no up grade available go to front desk get upgrade. first move new elevator new wing. The suite only one bed so now a roll out bed. Bed comes move the furniture and their is candy and a frisbee on the ground . Now back to the front desk they said they would give us the same suite and comp the resort fees ok we second move third elevator third wing still no second bed now 30 dollar up charge for roll out bed. Three hours of Batchelor party in Vegas wasted Monty Carlo fail won't be back say somewhere else for the money
Just checked out. We had looked forward to staying at the Monte Carlo. We had better offers from other hotels but since we had never stayed here we excited to try it.  When we got there, the room we booked, king non smoking, wasn't available,  so we agreed to the next available and we got 2 doubles smoking. The tv didn't work,  the was cockroaches on the floor!. The next day they gave us the king non smoking,  the shower faucet ran all night and the toilet wouldn't flush.  The room next door was smoking weed and we were getting it thru the vents. By the way, ac sucked.. Never again.  We were so disappointed!
We got a super great deal on our room and now I know why.. . Check in was pretty simple. They were able to accommodate our party on the same floor which was great. .  We upgraded to a Monaco suite solely for the whirlpool tub. We got to our room and we had just a normal tub. I called to find out why our suite did not include this and they informed us that the health and safety department made them take the jets out. Totally fine, but considering we upgraded for that purpose and the website as well as their brochure states that's what the suite included I was a little irritated that they did not notify us about this or at least give us the option to cancel our upgraded room. Our bed was lumpy and we didn't get much of a good nights rest the first night. . . I contacted the front desk about it and they didn't really do anything, just said sorry. The next day I was pretty peeved and decided to speak with the manager. He really wasn't of much help anyway and offered to move us back into a standard room. We booked at this hotel for the spa, why would we want to downgrade!? I wanted to take a epic bubble bath in the comfort of my room!!!. . I basically had to ask for them to move us into a spa suite that had not yet been converted. Finally They did after I explained how messed up it was for them not to inform us. It took forever for our room to be ready. They sent me a text saying it was ready so I went back to the room to confirm, only for them to tell me the text was sent prematurely and the room wasn't ready. We spent all day really waiting for our room and at around 4 ish, it finally was. . . The room was nice once we got there. Bed was MUCH more comfy. But honestly, there was too much work trying to get into a room that we paid for. This is a good place if you just want a place to lay your head and not actually "relax". I would definitely stay elsewhere!
