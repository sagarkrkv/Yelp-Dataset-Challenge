Very good burgers, a bit pricey...but then again this is Las Vegas. My friends & I were starving after leaving Marquee Day Club so we went here. Has an amazing Hooters/Rustic ambiance with beautiful waitresses. Love the couch service for dining.  I ordered the Sunrise Burger: delicious!. . The only bad thing I can say about this place is that even though the waitress are generally nice, they're so busy (or at least ours was) that they're customer service could be a bit better. Other than that, I'll be back again.
I came here for snack before going to Marquee.  Holsteins offers gourmet burgers, @ very high prices.  They also offer salmon and chicken options, as well as apps like wings & calamari.  In addition, you can also get foie gras on your burger for $12 extra.  Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w/ liquor at $11.. . I ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.  . . Unfortunately, the burger should have been called the "Old Standard", because it was a basic burger w/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn't that big, didn't have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.  The same goes for the fries.  They were nothing special:  Both 3 Stars.. . The ambiance was typical sports bar w/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.. . Holsteins is a pricey place to have a burger if you are staying at the Cosmo.  But I would definitely not go out of my way to come here.  However, I would go out of my way to say hello to Toshi, and just have drinks.
Holsteins is right across from Marquee inside the Cosmpolitan so it's the perfect place to grab a bite to eat after day club. I ended up getting the Gold Standard which was delicious. It is a little pricey but the patty is so big and juicy that it makes sense to pay $$ for the good quality. Plus it is SUPER filling. I actually shared this with a friend and we were both so full off of just half the burger. Moreover the fries were also good, not too thick or too thin but just right. I liked the crispiness of them and how they weren't too salty.. . My friends and I actually got our orders to go and I was the first one to order. However, everyone's food came out first and when my meal still didn't come out I mentioned this to the cashier. I jokingly asked if we could get some extra fries and not only did she throw in a box of fries but she also told me to choose a milkshake on the house. I got the red velvet milkshake which was TO DIE FOR. I loved the texture (had a slight crunch) and how sweet and creamy it was. I'm so glad I got to experience their shakes since I heard that they were pretty good. However, they are originally around $14 which is pretty expensive. I would recommend sharing one between friends so you can at least get a taste for it. . . I think everyone should go here at least once on their trip to Vegas! You won't regret it :)
Great place for Blended Shakes. My Banana mixed shake was pretty awesome.. Nice ambiance and kool place to chill !!. Heard great things about there burgers. Although I havent tried . any of them, I only hear great things!!
Pretty good burger joint.  I have been to better, but nothing to complain about.
Great place to get a burger in the strip. You're likely going to have to wait but where in Vegas do you not have to wait?. . The fried pickles are awesome and the shakes are fantastic. Well-seasoned, juicy beef patties. Not cheap, but they are generous with portions.
Love this place. . . This is our go to place for a quick bite EVERYTIME we are in Vegas and staying/visiting THE COSMO. . . Over time, we have tried the following and have fallen in love. . . Thai Steak Salad. Fried pickles (don't ask, just try). Kobe beef sliders. Truffle lobster mac-n-cheese. Ahi Poke tostada. . Try these. You won't be sorry.
I've only been here a few days and I've eaten here twice already! Love this place. Casual, great burgers, great beers, great service. Can't say enough about it!
Ok, I just have to say one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had the fun-ghi. I'm a sucker for anything with truffel oil.  This burger was cooked perfectly, and the perfect amount of truffle oil. I wish there was one closer to me in San Diego. Our server Joselito was awesome. Totally took care of us.
See my post on Bachi Burger. In a nutshell, this place is overhyped in my opinion. Food is good but not worth the price. Adult shakes were probably the best thing here.
Very quality burgers and drinks at affordable prices.  Good for groups.
Came here for lunch after a morning in Cosmo's pool. I was wearing a two piece bathing suit and one of those beach shirts. Was told when my party was being seated that I couldn't be in there because I'm not wearing pants. WTF, it's Vegas...people walk around every where with a thong even. We looked at the workers and all the waitresses had to wear booty shorts and knee high socks. One of the waitress, a black chic, her shorts were so high that literally half her ass was showing. It was kind of disturbing. But I guess they were trying to keep it classy? Lol. So what did I do? I sat down and just put my purse on my thighs. No one noticed, problem solved.. . Ordered a chicken caesar salad and meh, nothing great about it. The other person ordered the kobe beef burger and I had a few bites of that, it was DELICIOUS. One of the best kobe beef burgers I've had. The fries were pretty good too, asked to have it crispy though.. . For 4 people, ordered two chicken caesar salads and 2 burgers, bill came out to be about $80. Best part, meal was comp'd. #WIN
Great Burger. . . Went on Memorial Day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. We were able to grab two seats at the bar.  I wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. I got the brown cow float. It was lighter and he still had to help me with it! It was so good. I love a good root beer float. I could taste the booze.. . We both ordered burgers. He added an egg to the steakhouse burger. I got the funghi. Both cooked perfectly. They were delicious. Generous portions. The fries were ok but the burger was so big. Truffle flavor was there and the Gruyere was perfectly melted. It was a more refined mushroom and Swiss burger. In a good way. The fries were just ok. A place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. However props to including them in the price of the burger.. . We got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. BF said the cocktail he has was well executed. . . We will be back and next time I will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.
My colleagues wanted milkshakes after dinner so got a table.  I would say it was a mixed bag at the restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating but it was very loud in the restaurant so it was hard to hear.  My colleagues all enjoyed their milkshakes. Some with alcohol and some without out. I had a black cherry soda that was really tasty.  We also had some fries and fried pickles.  I prefer pickle chips as the spears were a bit hard to eat.  You really had to cut each bite instead of just biting the pickle spear.   The fries were tasty too.  I want to try their burgers another time.
I checked in at Holstein's yesterday with my husband, we usually do a date/day or night at least once I week, we are locals so we usually don't go to the strip much. I had the chicken fingers and natural cut fries, and my hubby had a burger and onion rings.. The fingers were very good( I am a super picky eater). My hubby was making the hmm hmm sound the whole time he are and the onion rings were fried perfectly and they didn't fall apart and leave you just eating the onion. The two HUGE ISSUES I had were with our bartender/ waitress who was nice and attentive BUT a little to much with my husband... It was like she took care of my needs as a customer but engage in convo with him, kept her eyes on him and when my hubby and I shared an inside joke that we shared, you told me.... Be nice..really?? Like I said we are locals and I have been a waitress, cocktail server and a blackjack dealer and I know the whole " flirt a little" deal but not with someone's husband. We both had our wedding rings on and we were affectionate. I think she should be careful with that, I was kinda taken aback.. We ate, food was good but I will never go back to that restaurant for that reason.
My burger patty fell apart after only a couple bites and so did my burger.  My girlfriend got sick from her burger.  They also sat a table of 5 next to us so close that I had to physically move ours over so I wouldn't be nudging elbows with the guy next to me.  Don't waste your time or money here.
We came here at night after a long day of traveling and partying. The burgers here r delicious. I got the gold standard because it kept on getting mentioned and it was delicious! I highly recommend it.. . However the service was okay here. Our waiter kept on pushing drinks on us, when we didn't want any and just asked for water he tried pushing bottled water. When we just wanted tap water, he had no smile and was pretty cold for us the whole night. My friend also got stomach problem from her food here. It was the only thing she ate all afternoon and night so we were sure it's from this place.. . I'm very torn on this place because i really liked my burger... Sadly the experience here wasn't that great
Seriously the best burger I've ever had.  I recommend booking reservations before your arrival because it can get a bit busy. The price is mid level but definitely affordable.. . I recommend the build your own burger- mine had potato chips, avocado, and blue cheese on it.... I also highly recommend the captain crunch shake!!! So good, tastes just like the cereal.
I'm a fan of Holsteins; it's absolutely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Every time I go I tell myself I'm going to try something new, but I never do- I'm a "Gold Standard" kind of girl and this burger is it for me. Great fries too and my husband says they make an excellent shake. There's usually a wait and it's not cheap, but totally worth it!
One negative:Very loud restaurant with music and the games blaring.  Was hard to hold a conversation with my husband. . Positive: good food and great service.
My rating is based on both the food and the service. My friends and I had come to eat here as we were waiting to check in to our room yesterday. It took about 15 minutes to get our waters. I ordered the ahi poke tostadas as an appetizer. There was an overwhelming taste of lime and cilantro that took over each bite and they were served on stale chips. For my entree, I got the El Machete burger. It was honestly just okay... The bottom bun was a bit soggy which made it difficult to eat with my hands without everything falling out of the burger. The best part of my experience was the fries (which were pretty good, I'll give them that). We were all pretty fed up and wanted to leave rather quickly. then it took a while to get our check which I couldn't understand because I looked around the restaurant and the place wasn't even half full. The most annoying part was that they included gratuity in our bill already (for our party of 6) so we couldnt give them the tip that we felt they actually deserved because they already charged us for it.
I have been to this place multiple times with my family and not once was I disappointed. I love burgers and it's fair to say that Holstein's is the shit! The place looks cool and the service is great. My combo, Gold Standard with a fried egg, fries, and their Spicy Bloody Mary...Perfect.
The burger was good.  Impressive selection of shakes,  it made me wish I weren't lactose intolerant.  The service was decent.  Cute decor, but very loud.  We were a party of 8, not at a large table, and we had to yell to hear each other. It was a little pricey... It was about $120 for 4 of us,  no alcohol,  2 shakes,  2 burgers,  a kids meal, and a small sandwich.  More of a tourist place,  locals would know a burger joint that you don't have to sell your first born to go to.
Great food. Burgers to big, what kind of complaint is that?  5 stars on taste, 3stars on price for the 4 star average.  Great shakes, very loud. Recommend.
Awesome burgers and great draft beer selection.  I had the Meatball burger which is made with veal, pork, and beef.  It was awesome.
Mediocre food, terrible service, overpriced. Stick to in and Out. This place is overrated
So good. The burgers are good, the adult milkshakes are good, the service is great. Good service is so hard to find these days, so it's much appreciated!! Went to one of the many other burger places while in Vegas that didn't even come close. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been here before!
This is the best burger joint I've seen in a long time. Everything I had was delicious. Go with friends, and share the joy around.
Came here for or first night's dinner on a Bachelorette party weekend. We showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. Then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. Real time wait came to about 20 minutes. Which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.. . Buttermilk Onion Rings - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce. Ahi Poke Tostadas - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce. Caesar Salad - was fresh, flavorful and delicious. Rising Sun Burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. Was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!. Fries - came out warm, soggy and sad. Gold Standard Burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. Added a fried egg for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese. Beef Sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. They would not let us add fried eggs to these because of size. Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake - this was really good if you like coconut. Brown Cow Float - root beer float with pop rocks! surprisingly good. . The food here was OK to GOOD. Nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. We were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. There were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. Considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. The server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after the burgers came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. Appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.. . I would not come here again. It was OK, but not awe-inspiring.
Nice burger joint with decent burgers. A bit pricey but tastes good! We shared lobster truffle Mac and cheese for starter which was delicious. The she had the Thai steak sallad and it was really better than we could imagine. I had the el machete burger, super! It would have gotten 4 stars if it wasn't for the high price...
Delicious burgers and shakes!. . the hype is real! I was a little weary this place might not live up to what people say but I was not disappointed. I went here with a group of friends and the wait wasn't terrible when we called ahead to reserve a table. We managed to get seated in about 20 minutes after calling. . . They have popcorn on the table! That was something new for me. I liked the their popcorn too, it was buttery but it had a slight acidic taste to it.. maybe vinegar? either way it was great to munch on as we were looking over the menu :) I decided to get the rising sun and the gold standard burger and an oreo milkshake to share with my boyfriend, The rising sun and the gold standard burger were the two most popular burgers to get but I could understand why! They were delicious but I really enjoyed the gold standard. It won the award for best burger in Las Vegas and I agree! After trying Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, I thought Holsteins was more enjoyable. Their burgers had more flavor and their ingredients really complimented each other. I thought their shake was good but it wasn't anything special. I think I prefer the shakes at Burgr.. . Overall I thought the food was great! I would definitely come back again :)
This is our second visit to Helsteins. They don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday making it harder to plan to eat there before a show but we tried our luck and it was on our side. We were able to get a table without too much wait at about 6-6:!5 on a Saturday night. Opentable must have gotten an upgrade since I used it last and now it will text you when your table is ready, gotta love technology! . . We of course had an alcoholic milkshake, we had the Cereal Bowl. YUM! . . We got the friend pickles, which were so yummy. I love the spears and I love that the coating did not fall off after the first bit. The sauce they are served with was good as well. I had the California Turkey Burger, tomato, avocado, pepper jack, russian dressing. It was really good and so big. I could have finished it but I resisted! The BF got the Rising Sun and he said it was good, he finished it all. We also got Sweet Potato Fries, which can never be wrong. . . The service was good and friendly and attentive. . . My beef with this visit was that they allowed a completely inebriated guy and his friend dine in the restaurant. The manager kept an eye on him from a far but he was literally heaving as if he was going to be sick. Not what I want to see while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. They would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.   . . I'll be back and this time I will ask for my locals discount, which the hostess could have told me when I checked in and gave her my local phone number.
We were staying at Cosmopolitan, and after checking into our room decided to grab a quick bite to eat at Holstein's. There was a lot of confusion from the beginning trying to even get seated, but we finally were.. . I ordered the beef sliders, they weren't great. Very bland. My friend ordered the California Turkey burger. It was so wet, the bun was soggy and the entire burger just fell apart. It was too difficult to eat so she really didn't enjoy it. . . My husband had one of the beef burgers, requested it medium-well and it was definitely undercooked.. . Our server was probably the worst part of the experience. He was condescending and very difficult to get his attention when we needed something. Specifically we wanted the bill and then to pay so we could get on with our night. The whole meal took entirely too long, considering what we ordered and the off-peak hour.. . I wouldn't eat here again. I might stop in for one of their overpriced milkshakes, but wouldn't eat a meal here.
As far as Vegas goes, there was nothing crazy over the top, indulgent, or extravagant about this restaurant.  It was a little cooler than your per usual diner in your city.  The prices were as can be expected from Vegas, so upward of $15 for a burger.  I ordered a turkey burger which was cooked really, really well!  Usually you think turkey burger and you think it'll be a super dry hockey puck.  Not here.  The meat was flavorful and juicy. Yes, I said juicy!  I would definitely come back for this burger again.  The spicy buffalo dipping sauce was misleading and wasn't that great.  The onion rings and fries were crispy and flavorful though.  All in all, a solid spot to get a decent burger.  It beats out all the fast dining restaurants that are scattered about on the strip for sure!
I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. I didn't think this place was anything different than any other burger joint. Maybe I've been to too many burger places?! Got the Gold Standard and I thought it was alright. The burger was definitely large, finished half, but for some reason it wasn't hitting the spot. The Gold Standard is a dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. The tomato confit was overpowering. Couldn't taste the garlic-chive aioli. It just tasted like tomato. Maybe I'm not a tomato fan? Maybe I'm a bit too harsh of a critic? The burger was good, but not a wow factor. Maybe next time I'll hold the tomato confit and add mushrooms instead. A plus for this place is that it is a large restaurant. Went on a really busy Vegas weekend and didn't have to wait for a table. Maybe all of vegas was still recovering from the weekend's vegas motor speedway festivities and we were the few that got ourselves up to get some lunch.
I wanted this to be my last stop before leaving Vegas. It's conveniently located inside Cosmo and takes reservations. Our party of 6 was able to call in that morning and have our table ready in 15 mins! Bright and spacious restaurant that can fit a variety of groups.. . They offer complimentary butter and vinegar popcorn, (pretty darn good) while you look through their menu. Holstein's is popular for their alcoholic milkshakes, so naturally, we spent longer picking a milkshake than a burger.. . My bf and I each ordered their most popular burgers along with the Campfire Smores milkshake to share.. . The Rising Sun ($18) -- Kobe beef covered in a teriyaki glaze with tempura avocado. I enjoyed the first few bites but was over the glaze, I don't usually prefer sweet sauces. Fairly large sized burger that will certainly make you feel guilty.. . Gold Standard ($18.50) -- This dry aged beef sirloin burger is similar to others you will find, with bacon, arugula, and garlic-chive aoili. We both enjoyed this more and agreed you can't go wrong with it. Their natural cut fries are also better than the sweet potato fries, which are nothing special.. . Campfire Smores Milkshake ($13) -- They have a great selection of milkshakes and it was really hard to choose! The waiter recommended this and you can't really go wrong with graham cracker crumbles. Very tasty and sweet but you couldn't taste any of the Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka. Presentation was also nice with the toasted marshmallow.. . Out of the two burger joints we tried this weekend, we prefer BurGR more. This was the most I have ever paid for a burger and have had better. If I come back, it would have to be for a milkshake, I don't think I can throw down $15+ for another burger.
The rising sun. Nuff said. 10/10.
I love astronaut cows! So cute! So cute and DELICIOUS!. . So I had no clue what to expect from Holsteins, was it going to be amazing like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or disappointing like Burger Bar. However, I read in their description about how they are all organic and I had to give this place a try!. . First off, the decor is really modern with colorful drawings of the astronaut cows. Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:. . Gold standard- 4/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.. . Rising Sun- 4.5/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.. . Smores milk shake- 4/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.. . Overall, our hostess was super nice. However, they seemed to be understaffed and I had to yell out to them to get their attention. I would rank this place miles above burger bar but under Gordon Ramsay's.
