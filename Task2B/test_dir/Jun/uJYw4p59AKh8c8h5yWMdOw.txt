Horrible room service food, bad attitude from front desk and the carpets and whole floor is dirty good if your in high school.
Worst place ever! First, this hotel changes you extra for everything ! You want a fridge? Extra you want an early check in? EXTRA! Late check out? extra! Not to mention room service is a rip off, not only do they add gratuity but they charge an extra 5$ service charge!So a 20$ meal ends up being 30$. I will never stay at this hotel again.
Planet Hollywood has to be one of the best hotel's to stay on the LV Strip !!!. Diagonally opposite from Bellagio fountain and next to Paris.... Equidistant from Hotels and Casinos on both sides.... not as pricey as Bellagio and fantastic ambience... They have good options for lunch/dinner and casino is also pretty nice !!!. . I visited Planet Hollywood during Thanksgiving in 2013... Have already planned next booking to LV and guess what i am staying at Planet Hollywood :-)
You pay for the central strip location, not for service or decent rooms.. . We got a deal through a 3rd party site, so that was the only reason we chose to stay here. When checking in, the guy helping us told us we had a $25 food/bev credit for the trip, and when we asked him if it was each day and where we could use it he excused himself to ask someone and then came back to tell us it was each day, and we could use it anywhere. We just had to charge it to the room and they would apply the credit. He also said there was a resort fee (there always is) that includes internet and the gym. We however learned you, again, had to charge these things to the room and then they would apply the credit. The internet is only for one device, and didn't work majority of the time.. . Our room had a beautiful view of the roof, literally 6 inches from the bottom of our window. We couldn't even see beyond the roof. The bathroom had this weird double door that didn't close/lock/shut at all. The room was themed (ours was Fifth Element), which meant there were a bunch of pictures from the movie hung up instead of tacky hotel paintings, and there were "props" from the movie on display in the corner. The props were not cool, neat, or deserving of the amount of space they took up in the room to display.. . Our bathroom was gross and outdated, the lights in the bathroom would go out if you plugged in anything to the bathroom socket (no joke, the girlfriend plugged in the blow dryer and the lights went out). We had to reset the plug but was still quite humorous. Our iron didn't heat beyond luke warm, and our telephone on the desk in the room didn't work. Thank god there was a second one. We had to call down for turn down service because we were never up and out of the room by 8 am, when the housekeeping attendants would come by. We didn't even find the "Do Not Disturb" sign until the last day (it was tucked behind some promotional junk on the door).. . The TV in the room promised movies, services, and express checkout. The promotional junk they give you with your key even had channels listed with information on restaurants, concerts, and all the nightlife. Too bad the TVs only had low def feeds of 12 channels (CNN, ESPN, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, TBS, Telemundo are the only ones i can remember). Any channel over 13 was met with a loud high pitch beep that sounded like a smoke alarm. The Menu button did nothing, and ultimately you were left watching fuzzy garbage in between going out and getting ready.. . The pool had potential but is simply a large slab area with two pools, one family friendly and one 21+ with a DJ. The DJ is set up right next to a handful of chairs and daybeds and is deafening. The pools are no bigger than the standard community pool. All the seating around the pool is by rental only ($60 a day for the daybeds). The rest of the chairs are out of sight, in the sun, and I'm not confident enough to say they would have been a good place to leave anything since I didn't see ANY security. No outside drinks, by the way, so make sure you chug your complimentary cocktails you just got downstairs and find a place to ditch the glass, because you will be sent away.. . The daybeds were $60 and we were told that they were yours for the day. The daybeds were covered in bird crud and not very nice, but they did have an umbrella and a side table and were in sight of the pool. For that reason alone we got one for the day. When we decided to go eat lunch we asked if we had to do anything, or if when we came back we would need to get a new bed. The guy reassured us that the bed we had picked and been on would be ours all day. Not 2 hours later we got back and the bed was not only being used, but all the beds were now taken. We asked the new guy there to help us and he told us to go ask if they had their wristband (their only way of decyphering who paid and who didn't). Apparently this was our job now. We made a stink about it and all they did was find us a pair of chairs right next to the DJs speaker and said "There you go". So much for customer service.. . Upon checkout, we found out the places we used our credits didn't work for the credit, and were handed a list of places we could use it. Where the heck was this when we checked in?! They said they would take it off, and then still charged us for it all. We had to call it in, and are still awaiting our refund they recently promised us.. . Never, never, never ever ever again will I stay at this dump hole. They put no money, charm or class behind their hotel that they put into their casino. Not family-friendly or family oriented. If you're there to get trashed and need a room to sleep in (not bathe or hangout by the pool at) just sleep this is a great place for you. But if you need to spend more than 5 minutes in the room, you are wasting every penny on this dump.
Love this hotel!!! Stayed in the "Forest Gump" room. It had memorabilia from the movie and a great view of the Eiffel Tower. I love gambling here  as well at the Pleasure Pit.  Overall this is an awesome hotel/casino.  I recommend checking this place out!  The only thing I don't like is that they recently started charging a resort fee. But, I still love this place...
Good: Location!!! This hotel is in the center of the action and close to tons of great restaurants and shopping. Hard to beat the location for the price we paid. The rooms are also pretty spacious as are the bathrooms. The casino was great - definitely a younger/wilder crowd which was just fine by us but keep that in mind if you're not looking for that. We also ate at a lot of the restaurants inside PH - Yolo's, Planet Dailies, Koi, and Spice Market Buffet. Koi was DELICIOUS as was the buffet. Planet Dailies wasn't too bad either. Yolo's...I probably won't go back.. . Bad: We had two rooms adjoined, and both were kind of dumpy and outdated. One of the rooms' bathrooms (room #788 to be exact!) smelled like sewage the entire time we were there. Like an unbearable sewage smell that literally made us gag when we had to use the bathroom. I called three times to have someone look at it but not sure if they ever actually did. It was really disgusting. Also not one but BOTH of the safes in our two rooms didn't work. Lastly housekeeping left A LOT to be desired. One of the days they cleaned our rooms, out of four beds they only made one of them. It was bizarre. They left all trash and empty bottles, food containers, etc. and didn't throw any of it away the entire four days/three nights we were there. We ended up piling it all on a room service tray and setting it outside our room the last night just to get it out of there. Really terrible service. OH and I can't forget the pool! Pretty small and an odd setup (but my crew and I still had a blast regardless). I HIGHLY recommend reserving a cabana or at least a daybed if you plan on using the pool. We did a cabana for around $600 for the entire day + a bottle and some mixers. It was worth it to have a decent amount of space for our group and also plenty of shade when we needed it, but the service was pretty terrible the entire day. I think it took about an hour for them to bring one of our drink orders; the servers just seemed generally confused. Also the cabanas all look about five years overdue for an update. They could use a MAJOR facelift.. . All said and done, I probably would stay here again but only if I got a good deal on our rooms like I did this time. I would never pay regular price for a room here; plenty of much nicer places on the strip to get your money's worth. Pretty much got what we paid for on this trip - luckily it's VEGAS so we were out and about not spending much time in our room anyway!
This review is based on hotel service and MANAGEMENT only (Manager Roberto and Pool Manager Chris) . . My brother, fiance, a friend, and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.. . The day that we checked out (Monday), the bill came to $1500. Um, what?. . We knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE), but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill, we saw that there was a "Pool Bar" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.. . She said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM, what x 2??. We asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar, just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!. . Cecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us, "They said it was YOU, you were at the pool and they remember you." Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask, well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated, she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.. . 20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was "helping" him first. Observing from the side, it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.. . When it came to our turn, we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact, just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday, NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance, friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room, had problems with the wifi, so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The "POOL BAR" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.. . After pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time), Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.. . We stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh, no. . . FINALLY, a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask,  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS, the "pool manager". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was, he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us, "wow, the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity, but then there was an addtional $120 tip, that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID." In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. . . COMPLETELY WRONG.. . He then proceeds to say, "But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.. . 5 minutes later they both come out and tells us, "Sorry, there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card." My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance "hope you're doing better". WTF.. . Roberto then tells us again, they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us, "oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you." Ok, thanks for removing the wifi charges, but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.. . I've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras, they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled, they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi, etc, but NOPE. . . WORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again.
We spent my birthday here last year and we can't stop thinking about what a great time we had! Planet Hollywood came through with flying colors in location, service, food, room cleanliness, amenities, and room view! . . They are located right where all of the action is! Right smack dab in the heart of the strip, across the way from the gorgeous Bellagio lake and fountain show, also connected to the miracle mile shops, a hop and skip a way from the Paris hotel and casino and right across the walking bridge from the swanky Cosmopolitan and The Aria.. . They are also very pet friendly. We were greeted in our bedroom with 2 goodie bags filled with organic treats, doggy bags and bowls for both of our dogs. They also have a little dog grass area adjacent to the valet and casino entrance.. . I loved the clean and large soaking tub in our room and the bed was absolutely comfortable. We spent one whole day of our vacation in bed! The Bellagio fountain view from our room was also perfect. We enjoyed over a handful of water shows day and night in our room.. . We also enjoyed being able to grab super late night food right downstairs at the Earl of Sandwich or walk across the bridge over to The Cosmopolitan to grab some famous Secret Pizza. There is also a 24 hour Starbucks on site (necessary!) We also tried the Spice Market Buffet with our dining credit, but it didn't impress us. I found myself with several plates stacked high with crab legs, lemon, butter, and that was pretty much the highlight of my dinner. . . During the day, the air conditioned Miracle Mile Shops connected to the Planet Hollywood is always a great escape when you want to stay out of the sun and get away from the heat. There are a number of shops and restaurants in there. . . Yes, they aren't as new as the cosmo or as fresh as the other casinos, but I won't deny that they exceeded our expectations in world class service and cleanliness. A huge step above our experience at the Paris hotel and casino.
Good casino but a bad hotel.   Hotel needs a makeover with its rooms showing age.  The advantage to Planet is the casino which is always busy and you seem to have some luck or at least some fun. Food choices are good with Ramsey Burger and of course the buffet is hopping.  If your not a upgraded player than be prepared to wait in line at buffet solely do to lack of speed from cashiers.  Never too full if they would just go faster and maybe slap the crap out of tourists that stand there for fifteen asking questions. ......its a buffet! !! Thankfully I have the upgraded club card to bypass this hell.   Location is central with walking the best way to get around.  Club is a club that is a club.   Tourists keep me from going to clubs in vegas which is wierd but really they are like kids  in a candy store acting like brats or old looking like perverts.
Stayed here for two days and things went very pleased with my stay. I loved how the hotel is right in the middle perfect distance to everything. The room was good bed was comfortable and bathroom was well . When we checked in Saturday morning the lines weren't that big after 3 they get long . People that worked there were nice . Overall I would def stay here again
Great location but I probably would not stay here again.  I took my dog and got to stay at pet stay on the 8th floor for 3 nights comp.  I had a hard time finding parking area to begin with.  Found parking and was lost to how to get to the hotel registration.  I had to walk through miracle mile to get to the hotel registration and the distance is ridiculous if you ask me.  Valet park if you are checking in.  The pet relieve area is downstairs on the lobby level and it's literally a small patch of grass.  I wish they would've made this area bigger.  They also never refilled the poo bags for days.  You then have to run through running taxis to cross.  Just horrible.  The staff at the hotel are horrible as well.  Our room set was weird as you have to turn to your side to watch tv.  The closet is attached to the tv entertainment center.  The only thing I liked about the room was the big bathroom as it had a separate tub and the shower.  The shower head shot through so hard that it hurts to shower though.  Our lamps in the room didn't work and when called the front they transferred me over to the department that takes care of it.  I was told they will come but they never came so we stayed in the dark room.  I called back the next day and they said I should've never been transferred??  What???  I asked what time they are coming to fix it as hotel agreement said that I had to be in the room with the dog when staff come in and she said she didn't know.  How do you expect someone to follow your own policy, but you don't know when you are sending someone?  I argued with the dumb chick as she put me on hold and said 10 minutes.  Maintenance guy came promptly and fixed the problem.  I then called housekeeping and made an appointment to clean our room between 12:30-1:30PM.  I waited patiently and no one came.  I called back at 2:30PM and cancelled as I will not just wait for housekeeping while I'm in Vegas.  I also went to their pool.  They have 2 big pools and live DJ, which was cool.  If you think you are gonna swim, forget it!  Everyone is holding their beer in the pool standing up like sardines.  I ordered drinks with my girls and they were $15 each!  Luckily our waitress was nice but it's pretty pricey.  I have been a faithful customer to the Harrah's organization and have been very happy with their hotel and service, but Planet Hollywood doesn't cut it.
I came here on my Ellen giveaway. Really quick check in considering I was checking in on a holiday. The front desk was really nice when arriving. The parking is confusing, you park at self park and walk through the whole miracle mile mall to get to check in counter and back again if you need something from your car. Free parking though. They gave us a room with a view to the back of the casino, boooooo! One plus is that the location of the hotel on the strip was frigging fab! When we got to our room it was nice and roomy, then I ran the bath, very very loud plumbing and thin walls! Only one of the side lamps worked, all the cables to the other lamps were just tangled with each other, uhh fire hazard.  We stayed a total of 3 days and 2 nights,  house keeping never came, no clean towels no clean sheets for those days. Oh and courtesy flush when using the bathroom, they get backed up very easily considering the fact that you have to flush the toliet paper you've just used. Major plus, I lost my phone and an amazing couple returned it to me! Anyways, pretty good for a free stay at a hotel.
Stayed here last December and it was such a GREAT place to stay. You really don't have to leave if you don't want to!!! A definite must if you are going out to VEGAS! Has great food, great bars, great shops, and shows. . I will definitely stay here again
Hotel: Planet Hollywood. Room Type: Hollywood Hip Fountain View. Room Number: 3683. . Check in:. Considering it was Friday 1pm the line was short. I had to pay a $16 fee for checking in before 3pm. However they do offer to simply hold your luggage until 3pm so you can venture off and check in later to avoid the fee.. . Service:. Everyone working there seemed very helpful and tentative. I did not make any special request apart from the view. I asked the lady at Check in if they had any rooms available on the 30th floor with 2 beds and she gave us one on the 36th. I felt that was a good level of service as she was very tenacious when searching for it on their system. Room service came every morning without fail and even returned later when requested.. . Casino/Restaurants/Local Venues. The hotel as you may know is attached to the Miracle Mile Mall which has an array of stores and restaurants that you would find in many Malls.. In side the lobby there is a Starbucks and on the Casino level you will find another one which I heard is open 24hrs. Also there are many restaurants such as Pinks HotDogs (yes the one from California) Gordon Ramsey's Burger, Planet Dailies and various other cuisines. . The old Gallery Night Club has gone and is now KOI which has more of a lounge bar feel to it. - This isn't a very popular venue and does not attract any popular DJ's however its worth seeing as promoters around the Casino will give you free entry and a free drink to just step inside.. . The Room:. The rooms are themed by movies - We had The Long Kiss Goodnight. As you see in the photos they decorate the room with costumes and props from the movie.. I feel the photos on the website did not fully reflect the room. They very rarely do. . It comes equip with the basics - Large TV, Shower and Bath tub and it was very clean and tidy yet the furniture is slightly worn and scratched.. The view was impressive of the fountains, however, the wind was very small. I would expect a room advertised as (and priced as) a Fountain View Room to have floor to ceiling windows as at TheHotel (soon to be Delano) and The Encore. . For the price I cannot complain. Although the quality does not compare to that of The Signature it certainly is better value than that of the newly refurbished MGM Grand.. . The Location of Planet Hollywood is almost dead center of The Strip (It seems Bellagio is the most central to North and South) which is a bonus and its dead opposite The Cosmopolitan so if you wanted to visit the popular Marquee Nightclub you would not need a taxi at all.
Do NOT EVER consider staying at one of the Caesar's Entertainment properties. If you are injured and it is their fault, they turn you over to CCMSI which is their 3rd party adjuster and they NEVER have any intention of repaying you for your costs associated with the injury. My grandmother, my mom, myself and two others stayed in a suite at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas from June 18 to June 22, 2012.. . The morning we were to leave, my 84 year old grandmother entered the restroom and fell into the wall hitting her head. There was water totally covering the floor due to a cracked toilet. She had out of pocket expenses associated with her testing and follow up care. There is a two year statute of limitations to recoup your expenses. She and my mom talked with the claim adjuster on a regular basis. Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. (CCMSI) first adjuster was Joy Van Riper. She was replaced by Doug Buchanan in 2014. Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.. . We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.. . Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, "That's my job." Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.. . We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.. . So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.. . PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country. Please help spread the word about them taking advantage of the elderly and defrauding the U S Government through Medicare fraud. We will not rest until there is justice for my grandmother.
We arrived at PH on Thursday night to check in to our room (that had already been previously paid for).  We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for $20 per night.  We said that would be great and I left my debit card open in case we wanted room service.  A day later I checked my balance and they had taken $400 as a deposit.  I was in disbelief.  So I called down to have them close my card out and bill me for the $20 per night upgrade.  Now they inform me there are $24 per night resort fees.  Was never told about these charges either.   Plus, I already paid my resort fees when I initially paid for the room.  So why am I being billed for something twice?  They couldn't give me a straight answer to that question.  So after the $20 upgrade per night, the $24 resort fee per night, and the tax...I had a $185 room upgrade.  . . Honestly, that's not a bad upgrade fee for being on the 37th floor (one floor below the penthouse) with a Vegas Strip view.  I am not upset about that.  I am really upset about the $400 deposit and the lack of information given at the time of the upgrade.  . . Overall, the room was extremely clean, and very nice.  King Size bed was very comfortable.  We hardly heard any street noise.  A/C was very quiet and cooled the room very quickly.  Bathroom was very clean.  . . Be sure to ask all the details of an "upgrade" before agreeing.  You may not like all of the hidden fees that started out as a simple "$20 upgrade".
I've been to Las Vegas maybe 10-15 times over the past 10 years.  I've stayed at numerous hotels, and the Hard Rock used to be my go-to place, but has gone downhill in recent years.  So on my recent trip, I was looking to try a new place and I heard good things about PH.  I was a little concerned about the pool, because it's pretty hard to beat the Hard Rock pool area.  My friend and I found absolutely no issues with the hotel.  Our room was clean and we had a great view of the strip - although it would have been nice to have a better sound system in the room (such as a Bose Wave).  The Spice Market Buffet offers a great selection of food, and I highly recommend.  Just prepared for a long wait if you go there in the evening on the weekend.  The casino had plenty of table games and slots and beautiful dealers.  However, the place I spent the most time was at the pool.  On the weekends, it's a really fun atmosphere.  And I didn't feel like the Pool Bar was ripping me off.  I found the bucket of five beers (mostly pints) for $34 to be a reasonable value for a Vegas pool.  If swimming or people watching isn't your thing, you play cornhole (free), or pool (I think it's $1/game) and ping pong.  There is also a blackjack area away from the pools where you can get your gambling fix without having to go down to the casino (I did).  Also, there are some great cheap eats in the hotel or in the mall at the hotel, and there's even a Walgreens on the exterior corner of the hotel with lots of alcohol and snacks so you really don't need to leave.  I found PH to be the perfect blend of everything I was looking for, and a great location at the center of the strip.  I'll be back!
I love Planet Hollywood the casino is 5 stars and the restaurants are great.  Good location on the strip close to everything.  The pool is good but not great like Ceasars  or Rio, but still nice.  The rooms are decorated nicely and overall I love this place.
A well maintained resort casino. Lots of dining opportunities nearby within walking distance, shopping too. Loved the soaking tub and king size comfortable bed, large flatscreen tv. This is a place that delivers with few exceptions. The conference facility is spacious also. This is the experience folks come to Las Vegas for. A solidly good choice.
This place was horrible. No one came to clean our room for the two days we stayed. Some of the staff were rude. We paid an extra $46 in miscellaneous room fees. Signal was HOOOOORRIBLE, it was very frustrating to get a hold of anyone while trying to get ready and make plans with friends, in the comfort of our own hotel room that we paid for. $15 per device for wifi, no bueno. And for the price we paid for on EDC weekend, the view should have been somewhat better than an awesome look of huge AC units and rooftops of their lower level. AND, also, another frustrating thing is trying to get anything good and cheap to eat. Dang, like a lot of other hotels have buffets and the fancy restaurants, but they also have a little food court with cheap quick food places too. Planet hollywood barely had any little quick food places that you can conveniently go downstairs from your room to grab something quick and come back with it to eat in your room. . . Definitely NOT recommending this place to any of my friends, neither will I ever come back to stay here on my visits to Vegas.
Well it's a brand of MGM but it's a low tier brand I guess - I didn't stay there only been to their casino which was not very impressive at all - People staying there were bit happy at all with rooms and service - casino hadchineese dealers which are worst when you are gambling - A person at PH won 10,000 dollars in front of 6-8 people but that dealer mixed the cards so they didn't pay him -
One of the worsted placed I staid. Extremely noisy room and really hard to find parking (that's if you manage to find the parking garage). Once in the casino, good luck finding your way out of there (the signs are poorly located and really bad directions). Room service knocked a couple of times but never went in to fix/change towels. I had to go ask a cleaning lady that was cleaning the room 3 doors down. She gave me fresh towels but refused to clean the room because it did not pertained to her. Really bad experience. Only good thing about the room was that it had a great view of Fidel Tower and the water show. Will not stay there ever again.
i have stayed this hotel for several times, besides self parking..... i love this resort, very easy to get anywhere...... i can get pink-hot dog and earl sandwich and especially a starbucks in loddy check in~ when i am gamble too much @ casino. order shopping is also very near ^^. but total reward program now charging resort fees, so my husband and i decided to go with M resort with comp weekend rooms and free seafood buffet and no resort fees. ^^
Okay I'm going to make this as short and simple as possible because I'm one of those people that don't read those long @$$ reviews.... . SERVICE: I'm VERY disappointed with the service I received here. For the price that I paid, I expected way more. We booked a room that had 2 beds (2 months in advance for my friends 21st bi-day) because there was 4 people staying in the room, when we got there they gave us a room with one bed because they were "sold out" of the 2 bed rooms. So, they expected me to cramp 4 people into one bed, and be satisfied with that! I called 3 times to make sure I was given that room! These people kept telling me yes! After I got back, and tell them that it's BS they gave me a room with 2 beds (magically opened up) with no fridge. I didn't care at this point, just wanted my room with two beds. . . PARKING: is too far from the casino. Had heavy luggage and ended up with a back pain. . . INTERNET: You have to pay for it -another disappointment, even Circus Circus has free Wi-FI (wtf). . The only nice thing is the location, but i've stayed in Paris before and their service is EXCELLENT. Stay at Paris instead (neighbor hotels), Planet Hollywood is going to stress you out instead of making you feel like on vacation.
arrived 12nn and told to wait till 4pm for next available room! wtf! poor customer service with bad attitude! seriously!
Over all not bad but... Wi-fi is issue. I do a lot of my work via smart phone. Was told I had wiFi access. After signing in, it lasted a whole 10 min until it booted me off. After that I could not sign on,.. It would just idle and not connect. I am assuming that it was because I was technically not paying the $13 fee for enhanced access. So as trivial as it may sound, I will not be using any PH resort in the future. I am just a drop in the bucket and do not matter to them as a customer. They got my room fee, that's all that matters to them.
