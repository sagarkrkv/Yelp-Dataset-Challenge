Great service and okay food. The food IS good, but it's just not particularly memorable. Our table had pretty much everything off the menu: scallops and meatloaf were the stars, lamb burger was dry and a bit boring, chicken was okay, desserts were tasty (wished we had gotten the PB & J Pudding as it looked amazing over at the next table). . . The Chopped Salad menu item is a bit bizarre. The menu directs you to the Facebook page of said chopped salad instead of offering any hints to ingredients. Odd marketing choice.. . So, it's a good time with fairly good food. The cocktails are tasty and the service was all in all very friendly.
I tried to setup a 15 person dinner after dining at CPH several times. The customer service for group reservations is AWFUL. They could care about accomodating and do not get back to you right away. Decided to take my business elsewhere and wont be back soon.
Just had an amazing dinner here. The chopped salad was beautiful and delicious, had every component a salad should have. The service was impeccable, so attentive and informative. Brad was our waiter, not only good looking, but considerate of our palates. I highly recommend the crab cakes,one sniff made my mouth water and when that first bite hit my tongue...heaven!!! Thank you Citizen Public House for a fantastic dining experience. Will be back for more, most definitely.
Had a great evening here!! We ended up getting a couple starters to share - eggplant burrata, chopped salad and baked brown sugar gnocchi. They were all amazing but especially loved the burrata. . . Drinks were great! Very fresh, didn't skimp on the alcohol and tasted fantastic.. . Service was the best part! Our waiter was very attentive and many staff members checked on us to make sure our meal was perfect. . . Thanks!
Very Good. One of those places where you just can't decide what to get cause it all looks good. The fondue is a must. I would go back for that alone. Also me got the beff belly BLT. Awsome!  And the lamburger. We will be back.
Busy, always busy. Great food, great cocktails, great service, always great in these regards. Perfect date place with a reservation. Bar seating is first come first serve, so try for that if you go on a whim. Ask about the specials too, always something cooking in the back there.
I was there backin November 2013. Professional mixologists, awesome drinks and up there as my top 3 dining experiences in my life. I had the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce. If it was socially acceptable I would take the cherry BBQ sauce as my beverage. Bartender was awesome.
Original plan was to try FNB, but their hours are weird.  Place was open till 10pm on door and on yelp, but the kitchen closed at 9pm.. . Well the lady there said to come here.  With very low expectations I decided to try it.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and she explained the menu and drinks.  They had a great selection of premium Scotches.  They also had 5 barrel aged cocktails.  I tried the Pacific coast and it was awesome.. . For my entree I had the lamb burger cooked at medium.  Wow was it good.  I actually wanted to order another one, but I resisted.  The burger came with fries and some pickled carrots.  You must try the lamb burger.. . Service was exceptional. Both bartenders made the dinner experience pleasant.  Service is a big deal to me, and they did a great job.
Very impressed all around with the service, ambience and food. Our server was spot on and you can tell this crew is well trained to make your dining experience vey enjoyable.
Atmosphere, presentation, service levels were all GREAT..... We had a group of 11 who ordered 5 or 6 apps and 4 of the different entree options (we ordered 9 entrees, but some were duplicates). I tried everything we ordered. Dishes were very sexy looking and were detail oriented. The only negative was some of the dishes (about half of them) just didn't have "knock your socks off" flavor. Gizzards (9/10), Chopped Salad (9/10), Crab Cake (9/10), Mussels (5/10), pig Pastrami (7/10), scallops (7/10), short rib (9/10), meatloaf (6/10), fried chicken (5/10), I think that's all of them. I would definitely go back, great cocktails as well, the restaurant deserved the food to be slightly more aggressive...
SCOTTSDALE: Had the chance to stop in at the most popular restaurant in this sun-drenched millionaire metropolis and I was blown away.. . Ambience and service (5 stars): The look is a little formal with white linens, candles and low lighting, but it is offset by very casual, approachable waitstaff and loud, jazzy, mid-century piano jam music.. . FOOD: . . Pork Belly Pastrami (5+ Stars/$13) Ahhhhmazing!  Order it: aromatic, flavorful in the extreme with a sweet pork/bacon taste. . Scallops Atop Corn Gratin Puree (5 stars/$29): This was outstanding.  The smooth puree balanced the scallops wonderfully.  Lots of flavor, complexity and balance.. . PB&B Pudding (4.5 stars/$10): This is delicious, smooth vanilla pudding, banana and caramel with peanut butter cookie spears.. . I am already looking forward to being hungry again for my return!
After trying The Gladly and falling in love, I figured I had to try the older sister, aka Citizen Public House.. . I am not huge on Old Town Scottsdale. Don't get me wrong - it can be fun, and there's some good eats, but I'm more of a Central Phoenix gal. That being said, this location is very nice. It's not right on Scottsdale Road, but rather on a side street, so parking isn't as crazy, which is a definite plus.. . Restaurant is big, spacious, tastefully decorated, and the service is good. We were lucky enough to get in on the tail end of happy hour. I had the pacific coast cocktail, which tasted pretty good, and it was strong, which made it definitely good. It had an interesting flavor and it wasn't too sweet. My husband had boulvardier, which was also nice and good if you like bourbon.. . Food wise, I had my favorite chopped salad because I'm hooked and I just can't get enough. It was lovely, as always. My husband had the buttermilk roasted chicken, which was awesome. The chicken was super moist. I love brussel sprouts so I gladly ate them off the plate - they were seasoned well and cooked al dente. Accompanying succotash was also very good. I wish we had tried dessert but we were too full.. . It was very nice, and if you live nearby or haven't tried it yet, I think it's worth a trip. Since The Gladly is a lot closer for me, I think it'll be my go to place, but I was not at all disappointed with Citizen Public House. Given the choice of any restaurant is Old Town Scottsdale, I honestly think this would be my number 1.
Hubby and I stopped in while visiting the area for Spring Training.  The beer selection wasn't as extensive as I had hoped a public house would be, but we found something we each enjoyed.  Our server was very helpful and gave us great suggestions...grilled cheese and short ribs...yum!  I so wanted to have dessert but we were stuffed and just couldn't do it.  We will definitely go back as there are other things on themenu that sound enticing and we really enjoyed what we ordered.
Having lived in the area for some time and looking to try something new, we walked past at first after briefly looking at the menu. . . We returned after talking to a few people giving rave reviews.  Very happy we did because it ended up being a wonderful experience from greeting (actually opened a few minutes before 3pm for us) to excellent service and drinks, with the finally, wonderful fresh foods.  We will be back!!!
We went to Citizen Public House because of the multitude of huge Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Our waiter was so knowledgable from the cocktails to the food and wine. Amazing memory. Thanks Citizen...we will visit again when we are in town.
Okay the best chopped salad I have ever eaten and they give you the recipe.   Go figure.   That was our starter and my friend and I shared it.   That was my only regret. I had buttermilk chicken with a sweet corn Butterbean succotash and roasted Brussels sprouts.   Absolutely delicious.   And the desserts off the hook.  . This place is a keeper.  Only wish it was closer to Los Angeles.
Nice atmosphere, awesome service, delicious food.... . I really wish I could remember our server's name because he was so friendly and attentive. Gerry? Gary? He knew the menu like the back of his hand and gave us honest recommendations for food and drinks when we asked him.   . . I wouldn't say the menu was huge and extensive but enough to choose from.  From the handful of items we ordered, I believe they are quality over quantity here.   Prices may seem a bit pricey but the food was delicious so well worth it.. . Pork belly pastrami-  Oh my gosh so good. . . Original chopped salad- Had to try this bc it's so raved about.  My first thought was how can a salad be so amazing?  So crazy how simple, fresh ingredients with a tasty dressing can be so yum.  I recommend. Get it.. . Short ribs entree- Deeelish.  Short ribs just melt in your mouth, great sauce. . . Pudding dessert-  We had some sort of peanut butter and banana pudding thing recommended by our waiter.  I'm not much of a dessert girl but this was yum.  Hubby enjoyed it since he loves pb and banana combos.. . FYI: There's a happy hour here but I don't remember the time since we just missed it when we arrived for dinner.   I'm still bummed I didn't try the bacon fat popcorn!
