I told their Executive office the Studio B, had fruit fly problem. They said they would let Executive Chef Durarte know. The Southern Nevada Health District came in and agents Tamara Gianinni, and her sup. Rose Henderson, said they saw NO VERIFIABLE COMPLAINT. I called their boss at the time Mr. Savage, at the time. I stated you better get these agents back out their to M Resort, or I will sue you personally! The very next day the same agents went back to Studio B, two of four buffet wait stations were infested with fruit flies. Soda dispensers needed more through cleaning. Made them eliminate the Asian Barbecue section. And food prep area was to close to back dumpster. So unless you like eating flies I would never eat their again, period.
GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!. . Now if you know me, you know that I love to eat. Now I typically don't do a lot of buffets because generally speaking I'm unable to eat a huge amount of food at one time. In order for me to really get my money's worth (or whomever I'm with money's worth) my stomach must be completely void of any food from a previous meal. I mean seriously. We got up one morning, stomachs growling and made the drive from the Aria to The M Resort (about 25 minutes or so) We were one of the first in line when they opened. Upon walking into Studio B, it was like the buffet pearly gates open and I heard harps playing and song birds chirping. Liker seriously. I don't ever in my natural life can recall seeing a buffet as grandiose as this one!. . There is like sooooooooooo much food. You name it, they had it. Ox tails (YUMMY) crab legs, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp, fried chicken, Mongolian BBQ, rack of lamb, prime rib, desserts GALORE. Amazing gelato (my goodness) Beer and wine included on the buffet. Sushi, steak, oysters, Chinese food, ribs......I mean everything!!!!! Everything was piping hot because they had just opened. This buffet did not disappoint, unlike the buffet at the Belagio. I will MOST definitely be back as soon as I get to Vegas.
I am very disappointed with the wait to get into the buffet.  The line is not moving and the hostesses seem very confused.  I don't think we will be returning.  We are locals and  our next visit will be to Bachannal.   No system in tact.   Poor management
My husband and I went here on a Saturday around 3pm. We had no problems with lines or seating. Our waiter was very nice and on top of things. However, we were not impressed with the food. There was a decent selection of food, but the taste was very bland and the desserts were so-so. We expected more from an $86.46(including tax) meal. The mimosas were nice and refreshing and the fact that, that and beer and wine is included is great! . . All in all, the food wasn't the worst we've ever had, but it surely was not the best and with that price tag, for us, it was not worth it.
This is the buffet inside the M resort about 15 minutes away from the strip. The hotel and the buffet are great.. . This easily in my opinion  is a top 5 buffet in Vegas out of all the major hotels on the strip. The food is fresh, the crab legs wereawesome and wait for it....... UNLIMITED BEER, WINE, CHAMPAGNE included in the price!!! . . Ya the price is $40 a person but....that's the price of all buffets in Vegas, this one just has an added bonus of unlimited alcohol! Give this buffet a try. It's worth it. Food, drinks, dessert are all great.
Not too shabby for the price you pay. There's a large variety of foods, an alcohol bar, and a huge dessert section. I came for lunch. The highlights of my meal included a berry cider, really juicy prime rib, shrimp, grilled vegetables, creme brulee, and all the ice creams.
Disappointing.  Crab legs were a bit dry, prime rib was overcooked, lamb was overcooked, The gentlman in charge of the carving station needs instruction on the doneness of meat.  . . The Carnivore prefers his beef so rare that he can see it slightly pulsing from its still beating heart.  He will settle begrudging for medium rare on occasion, but this prime rib was way too dead.  . . Nothing protein related was edible.  There were a few dessert items that were okay, but this was a dud.  The hype, at least on this night, proved to be completely unwarranted.  . . The single bright point was our server.  She was great.  Drinks were kept full, plates were cleared promptly, and she was cheerful.  . . Studio B includes adult beverages, but should consider making this an optional upgrade, or offering a lower price to those of us who might not be drinking.. . The Carnivore will not return to this establishment.
I ate enough for 3 so here we go. . . Asian - the fried rice was really good. I usually add soy and duck sauce to my rice but they weren't available . The Pad Thai was excellent. Spicy and yummy. I would stay away from the spring rolls. They were mushy. The beer is included in the price (free). . . Seafood - cooked mussels were tooooooo cooked. Rubber. The breaded shrimp didn't look good but they were good. The cold shrimp were very good. . . American - fries chicken was very good. Actually, really good. The chicken Marsala was bad. No real flavor. Now to the prime rib. I'm not a red meat eater but even I can tell you that this was great. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes were also very good. . . Dessert - great selection. Hazelnut was amazing. Creme brulee was fantastic. Flan was  flavorless. Carrot cake was good but dense. Eclair was nice. Pistachio was good. . . P.S. Beer and wine are free. There's liquor for your coffee if you'd like as well.
The buffet reminds me of my days dreaming about unlimited food. With unlimited supply. Its just sooooo good! I could stay here all day! Oh, and did I mention its also cheap? Hahaha.
This buffet does NOT have crab legs.  They have about anything else you can imagine including great sushi but the crab legs is definitely a deal breaker.  The desserts were excellent as well as the prime rib and pizza.  The pita bread for the hummus was hard and the salmon was very dried out.. . One strange thing that was going on was that multiple people had their shoes off and were walking around barefoot getting food..  I found it COMPLETELY disgusting and was shocked management did not do something about this or notice as I did.. . I am one of the hardest people to please with service and the server we had was THE best server I have ever had in a buffet.  I believe she may have been African but she 100% should be recognized for her GREAT service.
My mom is a local so we typically don't go to the strip when I am visiting.  The M Resort is one of the non-strip casinos she frequents.  As a local, she gets lots of free buffet coupons.  I also got one recently.  The line for the buffet is typically long but today it was quite short.  We actually got to go to the comp line and got in right away.  We did have to wait for a table for a bit as the hostess was consumed with some big groups that had arrived after us. She definitely forgot about us for a bit and I had to get the attention of one of the other hostesses. . . The food on the buffet is overall very good but the selection seems limited to me.  There are lots of different cuisines but not a lot of any one thing.  I always enjoy the salad bar at a buffet and this buffet basically does not have one.  They had lettuce but no toppings.  I did enjoy the Asian food and some of the mixed salads.  . . Since we got in free, it was definitely a good meal but not sure I would pay the full cost to go there again.
Prime rib is awesome!  All the food is fresh.  Delicious. It's a great deal if you have a 2 for 1coupon :)
They don't offer the California resident discount anymore. The line in front was forever long but the inside was not even crowded. . . Beer, wine, espresso is unlimited. That is probably the only reason we come back. . . Food at buchannal in ceasars is much much better quality especially now that they charge full price of 39.99 plus tax. . . The oysters are never fresh and the last time we had it we were not feeling good. . . Why I come back because apparently my friends are alcoholics and love the fact they can drink and eat at a buffet. . . . As for service hah what service? Barely see them but oh well really don't need service really.
Service is absolutely horrible. Staff seems completely lost and unaware of how to do their job. They were rude and said they are understaffed. If you are understaffed all day every day, isn't it obvious you need to staff more?. . Managers clearly don't read these nor do they care about customer service or else these issues would be addressed.. . It's a "self serve" buffet, yet the staff can't seem to clean tables and get people seated in a timely matter. 1 hr in line and they have moved roughly 20-30 people the whole time.  . . She had the nerve to say to me "1 person can only clean so many tables."  Every idiot knows that, except the one that only thought to staff 1 person to do that job.  All this time thee are 3-4 employees hanging around chit chatting with each other doing nothing.
Came on a Monday at 230pm. Line was ridiculously long and when I asked the host why she retorted "We have plenty of tables but not enough bus boys to clean. One person can only clean so much." With no apology I might add. . . Horrible front of house service!!!!
Ever since me and my mom spend thanksgiving weekend at m and used my player card to play slot machine, m resort will sent me free buffet every two month and constantly have comp room during weekend. Studio B is my husbands favorite, he love crab leg and I love their prime ribs. Alcohol is free and not bad for a drink or two ^^
Stood in line for hours and when you get to the front of the line, you will understand why you were waiting so incredibly long.  The most disorganized staff I've ever seen. Definitely not up to 'Vegas' standard. My family and I were so pissed that by the time we got up to the front of the line we didn't care how good the food was because the customer service was so awful. Not going back.
I've only come here for the lunch buffet, which is a steal at $15 during the week. Sure, the buffet isn't massive, but they have a lot of options here. It's divided into different types of cuisine such as asian, mexican, and american. Their thai food was actually pretty good. And theirdessert is amazing!! I have no complaints there. A plus is that they have wine, beer and coffee drinks that are already included into the price, so you just have to tip them.
