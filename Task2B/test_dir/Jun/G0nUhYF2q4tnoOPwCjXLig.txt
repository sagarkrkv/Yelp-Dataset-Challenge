We only came for a show but you can tell it's an older hotel and could use some updating. It just seemed cheesy and out dated...would never stay here willingly.
Excalibur Hotel is a giant, cheap motel. I have never stayed in any hotel / motel without a coffee maker! What kinda cheap spit is that?! The place wasn't exactly filthy, but it also didn't feel or smell clean. The temperature of the room was either really hot or really cold. The thermostat didn't do an actual, comfortable temperature. The bathrooms are also only okay.  Oh, yeah, no free wi-fi, even though it is the year 2014.  . .  This place is cheap. That is the best thing about it. I would not likely come here again.
I've stayed her a couple times as a kid so I decided for a weekend trip (5/30/14-6/1/14) I'd go somewhere I trust. The rooms are not bad in tower one. I did not smell cigarette smoke in the rooms (perhaps I was already adjusted to the smell from the casino floor). The beds were super comfy with nice fluffy pillows.. .  It was a bit tricky figuring out the maze of  th ehotel and all the different entrances/exits. Parking sucks unless you're in tower two where there is a convenient parking structure outside of it. . . The pools were very nice, overall pretty clean, staff was either very friendly or very rude. I got carded more to play cards than to drink.  I'd advise you to use your own towels in the pool. . . The decor is cheesy, but what did you expect? Its' the Excalibur and I'm all about the cheese factor. . . The best part is is that if you don't like the decor, the casino, the restaurants inside the Excalibur but want a cheap place to sleep after partying all night there are about 20 other hotels/casinos to go spend all your money in. . . Bottom line this place gets a 3-star because it's very average, there was no above and beyond I encountered enough rude staff to negate the friendly staff but I would stay here again, probably.
Worst hotel to stay in period..... It's not safe. They've had 3 different shootings at this casino in the past 2 years and last week they had a fire and has to evacuate and not let guests inside the casino.
This hotel is pretty outdated. When I went in the month of May, the women's restroom was under construction and I had to walk all the way back to my room! There was no view from my room. All I got to see were vents and walls and dirt. The pool was acceptable. The drinks were pretty overpriced, but it's Vegas. I suggest, when visiting Vegas bring a cooler and stuff it with drinks. It's way cheaper and convenient to have them there! And take lots of water bottles! One more thing!! WiFi is only available on the first floor and late check out is noon!!
My sister and I have never been to Vegas so we decided to take the trip together and make a long weekend of it.  She booked our room at the Excalibur Hotel and if we ever come back to Vegas we would most likely pick another hotel.  Not that the Excalibur was bad, the price was right and they are located conveniently at the end of the strip across from New York, NY and the MGM Grand.  They gave us a free upgrade to the newer remodeled tower two with a great view of the pool for free just for asking (thank you yelp tips).  I just think overall I would want to stay in a newer hotel that had more to offer like better rooms, pools and restaurants/bars. Still it's really not a bad choice if you just want a cheap, safe and clean hotel room on the strip with a decent pool area. . . The room that we had was really nice and very big.  The shower and bathroom were huge!  If you are in tower 1 the rooms are older and smaller.  One of the best things about staying in tower 2 other than the updated rooms is the fact that the elevator exits out right to the pool.  All we had to do was go downstairs and walk through a door and we were right there.  . . They also have a couple restaurants but nothing upscale and they have the Thunder from Down Under Australian strip show.  Otherwise the hotel was underwhelming.  Great I think if you have kids its seemed the hotel catered to families more than lets say Hard Rock would.
Came for the carnival games in the "dungeon."  Left within 10 minutes do to under staffing, multiple games being out of service and a thick cigarette smoke.
I booked this hotel for my brother as a birthday present. Long story short he came here, paid the upgrade and had sheets with dried blood on them nasty. . . I tried to reach house keeping could not, waited forty minutes on hold. Besides that I called and was only given a 30 dollar return. I think they should have also returned the resort fees, as the wifi had issues to and we needed it. I had to go to Luxor and login as a to access internet. . . Over all the arcade is cool, as is T. KIngs. Kids love that show way too much, heck even us adults do too. It saves you the trouble of rushing dinner to get to a show as it is a one stop event. . . The pools are the next best hong, nice, and no too crowded or dirty. . . Hated the staff, as not able to get assistance, and half are rude beyond anything I usually encountered. . . We love the food court, and the shops, as they are simple and not too overpriced.. . Would stay again, and hopefully get better service.
We waited 45 minutes in line to valet our car & then it took another hour in line to check in.....really
You get what you pay for here in Las Vegas! If you want high end and go stay at the Wynn or Venetian. That said the Excalibur is just a slightly bit better than Luxor which, when they first opened, was an incredible hotel.. . My last stay at Luxor was a couple of years ago was interesting because when I went into the room there was a body sized, maroon stain on the carpet. I went to the front desk to ask them if I  could please have a room that was not a murder scene. They said no and I left and went to Caesars.. . Everybody who comes to Vegas should band together and protest the "resort fee" bullshit. For $18 per night you get hard wired internet -not wifi; free faxes- who uses faxes anymore; oh yeah, a "free" local newspaper - we do something that has zero value to me anywhere I travel and I never even got thus.morning; and finally, let's not forget free access to the weight room!  Where else do you pay - in advance- for.stuff you don'twant or use????   . . You can't just blame Excalibur. But I have no problem quickly blaming big holding companies like MGM who basically owns a third OR MORE of the strip now and can pretty much do anything they want. . . If enough people complained to the Federal Trade Commission maybe they will look into it as deceptive marketing. Which is exactly what it is.  They can put ad on TV and websites for.room rates but the resort fee is not reflected anywhere in the room rate.. . It is basically the same scenario as with the airlines who are going to be forced to disclose all of the fees in the total cost very soon. I have done my bitching to FTC and Nevada Gaming Commission...why not join me and hopefully someday, even if we don't save money at least we'll know how we're getting screwed with everything in one rate!
Meh is the best way to put it. . . We were lured out to this place because of a deal. Honestly, I would never pick Excalibur to stay at. The location is not ideal to me. I'd rather stay closer to city center and I'm willing to pay for it, but I guess the deal we were offered was too good to pass. . . Parking garage was small but there's plenty of outside parking, but who wants to leave their car out in the hot sun? A few times we just parked at New York New York and walked over. Check-in is 3pm but if you want to check in early it's $20 extra. Lame! At least the lady at the desk "upgraded" us for free. Wasn't really an upgrade, just a slightly larger room. . . The casino is old and dingy, but they have free classes to teach you how to play craps and black jack. . . We stayed on the non-smoking floor but it seems a few of the guests decided to ignore that fact. The AC worked but it was old and made a lot of noise. Some of our pillows were lumpy. Bathroom was alright, definitely old. Room had wired internet. The cable reached all the way to the table. It was slow but still glad to have internet! . . Overall, this place could use a remodel. The decor is worn and outdated, but they do try to keep everything as clean as possible. There are a lot of cheap eats within the hotel which is nice and convenient.
I stayed at Excalibur this past week for 2 days as a staycation for my children and I. They have always wanted to stay here because they wanted to "stay in a castle."  I was not that impressed.  It was disappointing because I stayed here probably 10 years ago and it was much better at that time.  I got a deal through their website for $35 a night which was nice but I definitely got what I paid for.  The rooms were pretty basic.  There were noticeable scratches all over the furniture and the bathroom floor had cracks and marks which wouldn't have been a big deal except there were very big and noticeable.  The nice thing for our room was that we had a big window that the kids could sit infront of and look across at the NY NY rollercoaster.  There was no WIFI which was thoroughly disappointing.  They have a cord if you want to connect a laptop but if you have an iPad...forget about it.  They have a decent kids arcade.  They also have a pool area that my kids enjoyed.  The area for the kids was 3-3.5 feet deep all across and there was a waterfall and small slide that my kids loved.  The hotel itself is like a maze which I didn't enjoy. They have a decent food court area upstairs along with other restaurants.  I think if you are looking for a basic room on the strip for a decent price then it's okay to stay here.  If you are looking for something really nice and comfortable and more aesthetic then go somewhere else on the strip.
Relative to surrounding resort hotels, Excalibur is square in the middle. It's not decrepit, but there's nothing exceptional about it. . . There's the usual array of slot machines, table games, and drink options. The presentation of everything everywhere, however, has the consistency of flat soda. Excalibur IS a hotel, is a casino, has an alright pool area, has some restaurants, but everything feels old, tired. Cheap.. . The theme itself never makes sense. Paris has croissants and coffee. The Venetian has exceptional Italian dining, gelato, street mimes, and a gondola! So come on Excalibur, where are the giant roast turkey legs? Where are the fair maidens in bustiers? How about some ponies, or court jesters?  Excalibur has none of that, though it should. There's no wifi in the hotel rooms, which is about as authentic to the period theme as things get here.. . Still, 3-stars it deserves. Staff were very good to me at check-in, helping me situate my room and the rest of our party in relative proximity to one another. The gym is clean and overlooks the pool, so you can ogle while being ogled. The casino stays pretty active up until around 3am'ish even on weeknights. . . This place is probably fine for families on a budget with low expectations. You will not be wow'ed here, though.
I'm giving it 5 stars because it was clean and I had no big complaints.. only annoying thing we're the people in the lobby asking you to sign up for things or asking if you want tickets. Other than that it was perfect. ASK for a complimentary upgrade and you will get it. I asked for me and our friends that came and they also got it.Also they have 4 pools and one is only open on the weekends. Another one you pay 10 bucks and it's for 18 and older I suggest to pay the 10 bucks so you don't have to deal with the crowding and little kids running around.
Poor poor Excalibur ... I bet at one time you were pretty cool ... but now you just smell like rotten eggs :/
We took the family there for a weekend of fun by the pool and the pool hours are not great. Not opening until 10 and 12 and closing at 7 was not what we were expecting.
Great budget hotel suitable for the ENTIRE FAMILY. ALSO PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST HOTEL ON THE STRIP, AND I'M NOT INCLUDING CIRCUS CIRCUS -- CIRCUS CIRCUS IS NOT REALLY ON THE STRIP DESPITE WHAT EVERYONE SAYS. IF YOU WANT IN ON ALL THE VEGAS ACTION, BUT ON A BUDGET, STAY AT EXCALIBUR. IT'S CONVENIENT. IT'S FUN. IT'S VEGAS.. . If you're in Vegas with the entire family and don't know how to split couple's time with kids' time, this hotel is the PERFECT solution. . . For the kids: Fun Dungeon, an arcade located at the basement of the hotel. Games range from ticket-winning-style to winner gets the stuffed animal style. There's ski ball, basketball hoops, lots of ring tosses, etc. Kids can probably spend the whole day there and alternate between the dungeon and laser tag.. . For the whole family, be sure to check out TOURNAMENT OF KINGS. If you're a medieval nerd, this will suit you as well.. . For the couples: Dick's Last Resort -- PLEASE DON'T BRING THE KIDS HERE, Lick Me -- it's a candy store, but there's plenty of sexual innuendo toys and candies here, so I doubt you'd want to go as a family, etc.
This hotel was new for me and my family,we parked right outside the front so we were excited by seeing the entrance we got everything and went inside,I know people say it smells like they put something in the air but it actually smelled fresh.We checked in and like we saw Dicks Last Resort and the kids playing area.We got in the rooms and we were surprised,very clean room I mean VERY.We didn't get a good view but it's okay. The bathroom was decent and pretty,the tv was good quality not like the blurry ones.The pool was big and great (The slide wasn't open cause it was in March).I love how the food there was like new cause in others hotels they just put something that's new and other food,the Pizza Hut,Mickey Ds and More ,we then got Frozen Yogurt yummy!My stay there was pleasant I plan staying there again some day.
I don't see why people give this hotel such bad ratings! To start off I stayed  here during my spring break, let's just say it was a last minute vacation ! Lol basically all the hotels were full ( which doesn't surprise me it's Vegas!) & over priced. So Excalibur it was! I came with the family & my friend.                       . Check in was quick! Btw they have this really nice aroma when you enter! It smells really good haha. So then off we went to our room! It was clean & decent. The view? Eh it was bad we were just staring at the roof & well it wasn't such a big deal since we were gonna spend most of the time outside the room. Lights in the bathroom would suddenly turn off, so we called front desk & they got there pretty fast & repaired  it.The food court is awesome they have a variety of different foods! You have Mickey D's, Pizza Hut, Chinese food & much more. The pools are nice, they have a bar there! I believe there is 2 pools & a slide which wasn't open since I went during March. On our last day we decided we wanted to stay another night, front desk was super nice & said it was okay, we also mentioned about the view & said they would upgrade us to a room with a better view, but it never happend because the next day we were pretty lazy & were still sleeping lol but it was okay. . Overall, it's not the fanciest hotel but it wow me ! Didn't expect it to be this nice (: !
Not impressed, staff was fine. The clincher is that they want to charge for everything, I asked about early check in of course for 20 dollars, even though the room was ready. Then we go to the pool and there is no where to sit  unless you rent chairs and umbrellas at a ridiculous price. Main pool did not open until noon, one pool has a charge just to use it. To bad they do not let you know about all these charges up front. the rooms were usable but the AC was loud and the floors had a horrible aroma. Drink prices were different every time you bought one.. Will never go back.
Such friendly staff!  I figured they'd be sick and tired of tourists, but everyone proved me wrong.  Great security, clean rooms, good prices.  I highly recommend this hotel.
They gave us a room that smelled like someone threw up and they tried covering it up. When I brought it to the maids attention she acted like I was imagining it and it smelled fine as she was spraying some sort of chemical around the room to try and cover up the smell. I let it go thinking the smell would go away after a while. Lets just say when we returned to the room the smell was so bad I had to call the front desk. They eventually gave me a new room and it was fine. The rooms are all old but for the price I guess you cant complain. This hotel is right on the strip near the MGM. This hotel needs to updated for sure. The location is great though.
Room was clean and comfortable. Very nice for the price. There did not seem to be away to unload at the front door without paying for valet, so we had to walk a good distance with our bags. Also, this hotel is at one end of the strip, so be prepared to do some walking to get to many of the other places.
So just stayed at the Excalibur for 5 nights with my SO and a few friends and for the most part it was a positive experience. Check it went very smooth, the room was clean, up to our standards, and all the staff were very friendly. I also really appreciate the good selection of inexpensive places to eat in the food court.. . We were in town for an event called EDC which brings tons of people to Las Vegas for about a week (150,000+ peak). It's a younger budget minded crowd so this place has a lot of guests. With that considered parking was horrible here. I spent around 45 minutes looking for a spot one morning after the event. This was by far the most inconvenient thing we had to deal with during our stay here. I'm sure it's much better when the hotel isn't so full with so many people driving vs flying.. . I love the location and convenience of this hotel and definitely felt it was a good value. I will probably end up staying here again though I may reconsider if coming for EDC because of the parking situation. That's the only reason I didn't give the place 4 stars.
Nice hotel, love there food court it has so many options for the whole family. So you don't have to always eat the same thing well your there and it has plenty of the favorites that your used to as well as many new things. Love that they have so many entrances and exits threw out the casino so its not hard to get out or your not walking to the other side of the casino just to exit. For the most part they have very friendly staff. They have a nice pool area its pretty family friendly even though it is a casino. Overall it was an ok experience.
We stayed at Excalibur during a convention.  It is a cheap hotel.  4 nights $277 plus $80 for resort fees- in the heat of summer.  You get what you pay for.  The staff is polite.  We did have 2 people at the Business Center desk who went above and beyond to help us.  Check in was fast but not very friendly, justpolite.  The people at the doors selling tickets to shows are aggressive!  We learned to just say "Conference" and they left us alone.. . The hotel itself is a bit run down and needs a remodel, but everything works.  The water pressure on the 14th floor is not great and the toilet looks like it is going to overflow every flush.  The AC worked really well and yes, it was a little noisy, but that was a plus in drowning out the traffic.. . The pools were nice and there is a bar/restaurant there.  There were 3 pools and lots of children.  It was not super busy, so we had no problem getting chairs.  But the pools close early. . Location is okay, depending on what you want to do.  If you are here for a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center, stay somewhere else.  There is a free tram between Luxor-Excalibur-Mandalay Bay.  It is an easy walk to New York New York.. . Wireless is in the public areas but in the room, its wired.  That means a slower connection and you must have a laptop to plug in.  It has the modem plug.. . The buffet is okay= $23.  If you have the energy, I would suggest going over to the Luxor buffet  It is much better.  The buffet is over at 10pm.  You can eat on the cheap at the fast food restaurants- McDonald's, Pick Up Stix; Hot Dog on a Stick; Pizza Hut; Baja Fresh and a couple of others.  Johnny Rockets is also here.. . It was worth it to me to use the free valet service.  For a few bucks- your car gets parked in the shade and is brought back to you.  Love it!
We came here on a one night staycation because of a deal. The is actually ok, has a separate litte area for dining. But they stop serving at 2pm! What the hell is that. I've never been to a hotel that doesn't serve past 2pm. Maybe 2am but especially in Vegas it should be like most of the other hotels and 24/7that shit!
