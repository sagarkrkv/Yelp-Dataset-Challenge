We booked a one night stay at the last minute on a Saturday and it was a good value. When we walked Into the lobby, it was a bit of a junk show with people everywhere and a long line to check in. Once we got to the room it was great. Clean and comfortable despite the horror stories from other reviewers. It's definitely a different scene, but it's Las Vegas. We had fun and were comfortable.
Had a pleasant stay here. . . We stayed in the newly renovated area and had a pretty nice room. My hang up is on the few dark hairs I found in my shower which is always off-putting for me. The sheets were clean although definitely not the softest I've slept on. I noticed one of our towels had a whole in it, which I assumed was from how many times they probably get bleached. (At least that's what I tell myself!) We had a Keurig but were not given any K-cups. Late check out is an extra $20 which we haven't had to pay for in the past and didn't pay for this time. Slow wifi. . . No noise complaints as many reviewers have mentioned and for the price, I think we had a pretty good visit.
If your looking for a place to sleep only, this is your spot. Cheapest room I could find at $21 a night. If your looking to bring your kids to Vegas for the first time, look elsewhere. I was really excited to bring my kids to Vegas as this was their first time. We walked into the Hotel and the kids were like "Uhhhh dad, this place is ghetto" and it is. Not much different for when I stayed here 17 years ago. A lot of trashy guests inside. "because of the cheap price" the people in the room next to me were arguing all night and a call to the front desk was no help. The shopping area is pretty nice and the kid area with the games is GREAT! The free shows are pretty impressive also. Best advise, stay somewhere else but bring your kids over later in the day. Buffet was decent and our view from our room SUCKED.. Hahaha. You TRULLY do get what you pay for here.
Circus Circus still a great hotel to visit while in Vegas, the circus acts are fun. Excellent
DETAILS: . - we stayed on the 24th floor of the Skytower. - checked in last Friday and stayed until Sunday. - ate at the buffet, gambled, had fun at the Adventuredome, and used the pool. . I will admit, you get what you pay for but in our case, it was well worth the inexpensive stay with our ten and five year old. Every single staff member there were incredibly nice and helpful, the room was pretty awesome (my husband let out the loudest sigh of relief because he remembers how it was when he was a kid), it was very VERY clean, everything worked, we had a great view, and wifi was fast and always worked. We obviously spent time at Adventuredome and the pool, both of which were clean and great for kids. Even the high schoolers working the games were nice! The pool, although a little outdated, was very clean, and had plenty of clean towels and life jackets for the kids. The snack bar line could use more help because I ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for a snow cone and the showers in the women's restroom were broken. This casino is not the best to gamble at since it has only a dozen or so machines but they paid out handsomely:) All in all, for the price, it's worth it, it's not filled with ghetto people the rooms were great, and service was impeccable.
I stayed here for 3 nights in the casino tower hotel with my husband and teenage son. The room prices are fantastic, and you get large rooms. The casino is very smokey, but all casinos in Vegas are, so I can't knock them down for that. They have a very nice pool, and the Midway is great for kids of all ages. The employees we encountered were friendly and helpful. I would go back to Circus Circus.
Great place to stay.  Great for families to be. Very kids friendly. Staff is great and very nice
This hotel was okay. I went here around December of 2012. We stayed here for one night because we came a day earlier.. . When we came there we was looking for parking so we can check in. Lucky we got help right away instead of standing in that long line and it was 12 am when we got there. We got confused where we a post to go to look for the room we rented for one night.. . In the morning we wanted McDonald breakfast so my wife and I went to the parking garage where we parked and look for one by the strip, luckily a security told us there's one in the hotel itself. We got lost looking for it. We saw people with McDonald's breakfast and ask them, they said its by the casino, but it was by the circus circus arcade upstair. We ask a lot of people and finally found it. The McDonald's in California where we live is cheaper.. . The cool thing about this hotel was the theme park in door. I like roll coaster, but this one was tall and it have loops. It made me really scared. My wife went one it 3 times before we went home.. . Pros:. Cheap. Big parking garage.. . Cons:. A lot of people.. Got lost looking for our hotel room.
This place is okay. The problem I have with this place is they have no fridge or microwave! You have to walk like across the street to get to the pools. Parking is a hassle. Valet parking was also full! No one offered to carry our luggage to our rooms. This place offered lots of coupons in the room and you get a $20 coupon for the garden grill, buffet, and steakhouse. You also get a $10 coupon for the casino. This place is really crowded and late at night, it gets empty. My group heard the room next to us with their baby crying and they complained about our loud music. LOL. We also put a DO NOT DISTURB sign outside and someone took it. Plus, the housekeeper went in and cleaned our room even when we put it on. We didn't really see any drunk people in this hotel besides a drunk girl laying outside her room.
Stayed here on a four day trip, horrible customer service, said our rooms would be ready by two, and they were not.  Rooms were okay. Buffet was gross, bugs on the food. Only positive was the pretty cool circus they had. But I guess that's what you get for the price. Oh well.
A very old, dated hotel with a terrible customer service and with a ghetto neighborhood. Find a better place to spend your money.
If I could give it 0 stars, I would. SUCH a bad experience with this hotel. The pictures on the internet make it seem like its pretty decent for a "GREAT" price. We thought it would be nice since we have small children. I was wrong. I rather pay more and do other activities on the strip than to EVER stay at such gross hotel and horrible, horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE place. I was scared to even SLEEP in those rooms. Adventuredome was pretty lame as well and OVERPRICED. . . The parking garage feels like it's about to collapse too! the elevators to get to the hotel entrance ARE DISGUSTING. They smell like urine, cigarettes and alcohol. I mean it is even disgusting to touch those buttons. I felt like I needed a shower every time i would come out of those things.. . I usually take LOTS of things into consideration, but there was absolutely NOTHING good about this place. Such a a disappointment. . .  To their manager CHAD - either he needs more intense training on management, or he needs to find another career he is good at. Having other reps telling me what he said is NOT professional. ANSWER customers calls, don't hide from speaking with them. . . DO NOT CONSIDER CIRCUS CIRCUS even if it's just to "sleep" there... . . Good Luck!
Had a great time this year. We were here last year as well. The rooms are clean . Staff was friendly. Bring your own water as they want 3 dollars a bottle. But what do you expect it's Vegas. Adventure Dome was fun as usual. Kids had a great time.
We booked the hotel rooms because it was cheaper. We checked in  rooms are very outdated. It smells old. This hotel needs to update itself. . . It took us 1 hour switching between rooms but none of the room was up to our expectation.
If I could give this 0 stars I would.This hotel is creepy, and old. The "AdventureDome" is pretty old and stinks like cigar & it was very expensive, the games are not that fun & the carnival games give out cheap toys which I guess it's okay.The hotel room was not nice we found some teeth under the pillows,saw some stains in the walls and we found hairs on the bathtub.Yes,it's cheap but you get what you pay for. The parking lot is scary,dark and old there's two parking lots,I left my car I saw a lot of cars had dents & scratches.Also I get the theme is about circus but like cool it down on the clowns, they're literally even plastered on the parking walks. Service is too slow.The McDonalds is horrible the cheeseburgers taste like rubber.Bad neighborhood.Only thing by there that's good is Tacos El Gordo. Luxor & Excalibur are much better! Wont never stay here again.
Upon  walking into check in this line was ridiculous that should have been a warning that this stay was not going to be good. It took a hour to check in, we then headed to our room and the air was not working after calling more then 3 times we finally got someone to come. Mind you we came during the week on a tues not the busiest day of the week. They finally fixed the air, but the wait was horrible. The bathroom is tiny and where the coffee pot was stored DISGUSTING!!! We then took our kids to the arcade area over prices and a bunch of kids running rampant. The only reason we stayed there was for our kids, NEVER again!!! We will be staying at Excalibur or somewhere else this place is disgusting.
We came here because I couldn't afford much else. Unless you are dialed in, in Vegas you get what you pay for. The place smelled from the get go - but at least the hotel crew were nice. The room was clean but oldish. Not my favorite experience. . . My wife lost here cel charger in the ice dispenser. DONT DO THAT! Apparently it happens more than you'd think. It took nearly an hour to get someone to open it up and get it out. Time wasted waiting for help.. . WiFI included but spotty.. . We ate breakfast at the Vince Neil restaurant. The food was ok, portions were small. Go eat at Ellis Island Brewery it's great and cheap. The food vouchers they give you are pretty much useless. They take overpriced food and make it less expensive. We didn't end up using them.. . I really wish Circus Curcus could get their crap together. The whole place is overpriced for what it is and they won't be able to rely on $3 ring toss games to restore their image.
I had stayed at circus circus before and had low expectations to begin with. I chose to stay here because it had the lowest prices on the strip. However, this stay, we weren't even in the hotel!! We got rooms in the circus circus manor, which is an even further walk from the strip and about 10 mins walking to the main casino and game place. Absolutely SUCKED! The manors are behind the circus circus building and look like old, run-down motels. Even a walk to the main lobby was quite far and we were even further from the strip!! Not to mention, our faucet wouldn't shut off, it kept dripping our whole stay!! Circus circus usually isn't that bad, but if they place you in the manors, I would suggest going someplace else!
I have never stayed here but I like coming to bring my nieces and nephews!  -1 star because it needs major renovations! This is the only kid friendly hotel (aside from Excalibur) & smoking should be band!!!! It smells so bad in here. . . . Anyway, I love adventuredome & the arcade. You can spend a few dollars per stuff animal but its worth it to see the kids happy. They have a free show every 45min so make sure you look at the times so that you can sit 30 min before the show to get good seats!. . . Feel like a kid again in here ;) . . .
When I was a kid circus circus was magical and fun. The games were fun, the small little shows were exciting, and everything seemed magical especially when I won a stuffed animals. All of that faded sadly over the years coming back here. Then again that was back in Reno, NV. Maybe it was just better there. . . Coming to Circus Circus in Las Vegas always saddens me and the stay is a complete fail. My dad likes it here usually because of the cheap price but I would rather stay at a Motel 6 where it's functional and the housecleaning is used. This review is based on two incidents I was there. . . The last time I was there was with my family. We stayed at the hotel luckily. The interior is so outdated it just paints sad clowns. The inside smells musty and the housecleaning is deplorable in there. I went into the bathroom and it looked like there was a booger or snot on one of the towels. Disgusting! The toilet flushes as if you are about to be sucked into a whirlpool and worst of all the toilet wasn't flushing properly. My brother had to do number two and it wasn't pretty.  The plumbing is terrible and needs to be fixed.I can say the only thing I enjoyed here is playing a few of the games at the booths and watching a dog show. The buffet is average. There are a few good ones but the quality isn't the tastiest. . . Now the second incident was four years ago and it was the worse stay ever in any hotel. I think this topped everything. My stay there was appalling and excruciatingly terrible. I came with a group of friends for New Years. The whole stay was I don't know a hundred something? Really cheap for a stay especially during New Years. So we thought we got the biggest deal ever. We were all excited! By the time we arrived at the hotel the line was long and when we finally reached to the front desk the workers looked as if they didn't want to be there at all. Our front desk person didn't smile at all and looked as if working there was painful. It was New Years and it was bustling like crazy but the whole vibe just seemed miserable. . . When we received our hotel key we were directed to the back? I thought we were going into the hotel. Instead we were directed into the shady back area called the MANOR. All of us were like... wtf... and by the time we reached our room it was even worse inside. It was tiny and the interior looked as if it was peeling. The bathroom was puny and the place looked as if we time-traveled to the 70's, and not in a good way. So we tried to make the best out of it anyways. We just told ourselves we are staying there to crash and nothing else. The showering was a mess up and the plumbing was loud. Luckily we got out and didn't stay there to long to experience more of it's morbidity. . . So we had high and lows throughout the day and night and were exhausted. Once we came back to the motel we wanted to relax somewhat even if it was depressing staying there. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everybody from up, down, sideways. Everyone was feeling tired except me and my other friend so we left past midnight to McDonald's and had some coffee over there. When we came back we were locked out! Everyone was already asleep and we didn't have a key. My friend had to knock to get in and unfortunately the place is like sleeping in one room. Once we got in we finally crashed only to hear some obnoxious and rude a$$ neighbors loudly coming out the room and pounding our door and complaining. It was like wtf? Our friend wanted to call the cops but instead we let it die down and try to fall asleep. Do no, NOT stay in the manor. It was an awful stay and I would not recommend anyone to ever stray there even if it's cheap. Stay at the hotel instead. . . By the time we had to leave I couldn't fit a few of my clothes in my luggage and asked a few in the group if they can take my clothes. They said they would only to find out they instead left my clothes to the front desk because they had no room in their bags. They informed me that they gave my information and I would receive it. Guess what, I NEVER got my clothes back and my favorite football sweater is gone which was expensive also. The customer service needs a reboot. Circus Circus was once magical in my childhood but overtime I sadly found it jaded and unbearable at times.
I was very unpleased with the service here. Multiple things were messed up in the room and with our stay. For example I called prior to showing up earlier than checkin time and once I got there at five in the mornin I had to sit in my car until 11 after talking to three different people about the issue and they still made me pay for early check in.... Also our shower didn't drain restraining us from taking showers. And we paid extra for amenities including wifi which neither me or my friend were able to connect too. I definitely won't be coming back here. Oh ya and staff members who helped me were very rude. Plus maids were not nice.  I wouldn't give this place any stars.
We booked the hotel rooms because it was cheaper. We checked in  rooms are very outdated. It smells old. This hotel needs to update itself. . . It took us 1 hour switching between rooms but none of the room was up to our expectation.
We enjoyed our stay here enough. Sure, this isn't the most modern spot you can stay at on the strip, but it is cheap. Our room was clean and our service was friendly. Did have to wait in a line for 40 minutes to check in but, meh, I can deal with that. Free wifi was given and we enjoyed a few of the restaurants located inside the hotel. Would have appreciated having a mini-fridge in our room but again, you get what you pay for. All in all, we would stay here again (our room was located in the Skyrise Tower).
Horrible. The room had a weird smell, the windows were streaked and looked like someone had once sprayed windex on them and never bothered to wipe it off. They don't look at all as nice as the pictures online. And it was almost impossible to find the front lobby for checkin. When we first got there, we tried to place an order for pickup at the pizzeria downstairs. They wouldn't do pickup orders, only deliveries, and would charge an extra 15% delivery fee - what a joke! Never coming back.
So we came in at 3a, long line to check in, but we were upgraded to a mini site for free. Card machine want working so they had security open or door for us (didn't mind since we were only spending one night here) but the check was very friendly and security merry us at our door and was wise cranking commissioner Gordon! Haha, great guy. Nice little suite, comfy bed, nice soft/firm pillows, regular bathroom, didn't drain to fast but will enough. I do enjoy occasionally gambling here, and after this room, maybe might actually stay here instead of just a one time nap
I first arrived in Vegas too early to check into Circus Circus, so I stayed at the local Red Roof Inn for a few hours to get some sleep. . . I wish I would have just stayed at the Red Roof Inn the entire time, because it was so much nicer than this massively gross hotel. . . The only positive about this place is the massive free parking garages that they have. That's it. . . Between the air conditioning in the rooms that hardly worked, the disgusting elevators, the difficult staff, the annoyingly pushy housekeeping people, the overpriced food/alcohol/EVERYTHING that they have in their building, it makes for an unpleasant experience. . . Circus Circus is probably the cheapest large hotel out of all the big ones in Vegas - But do yourself a favor, whether you're coming with kids, or a significant other, save your money, stay at the nicely remodeled Red Roof Inn down the street where you'll save a ton of money that you can then spend on doing fun stuff in Vegas. Sinking your money into this damn Circus place is just a waste.
Old school. Went here as a kid. Wouldn't stay here as an adult as the rooms are run down and out dates, but a trip to Vegas ( or Reno...) isn't complete without some carnival games at circus circus. They also now have rides but super loud in the dome. I don't have kids but if I did, this would be THE place to go in Vegas. I don't find much use for their rewards club card as you have to but in with $50 to get any points.
I hate to give 3 less stars but I believe this to be appropriate. We stayed in the sky rise tower this time since we mainly just needed a place to sleep...our room was okay but not as clean as the west tower rooms. Also, we had a Keurig but no pods. We requested some but we're told they were out. . . The snack machines on 4th floor were in operable and took our money a few times. They took other people's money as well.. . Behind our headboard was trash and our neighbors made tons of noise all night. I am usually not one to rant about small things but these things couldn't be overlooked. Next time I'll stick to west tower.
Circus circus should be a great place for families because of their arcade and entertainment. However they don't deliver in the room accommodations. The carpet was horribly filthy. You can see it's mostly stained and has not been changed for 50 years. Seriously! The drainage in the shower was slow and the faucets were leaking. The bed cover/ comforter was so dirty...you could see the dust come out when you tap the bed. They had a coffee maker in the room which was the only plus, but that didn't work either. The pictures in their website looked good but man, it looks just like the opposite. I will never stay in circus circus anymore, even though they have the best entertainment for kids. We should just book somewhere else and bring them there one day.
I have only stayed here once, and probably the last time I will stay a night here.. The rooms are alright. They are rather on the small side, and they don't have really any views. . During Christmas time it was hell trying to check in. Fortunately they helped my Dad immediately because he is handicapped! I give them their stars for that..  . It is super easy to get lost here! I couldn't even find the McDonald's!!!! Also it's more expensive than a California McDonald's. . . The coolest thing here is the indoor theme park! I will come back for the indoor theme park  ^^
I have stayed at Circus Circus  before over the years for work conventions etc..  this last time was a joke it was like a ghetto casino from  arriving, waiting for ever in a line . I had online Mlife reservations with a $92 deposit on a $75 a night room. I thought ok reasonable,  after the long driving around parking structure to find a parking spot within a black of front desk.  line &  having the bell hop take us up to our room to find a half naked man in a robe on the bed   then we had to fight through the crowds with our luggage all over again to get to the front desk. got a slight I am sorry and another room lug all the way back up through casino past towers to the room.  Called front Desk what time is the pool open till?.  they said 9Pm    then the fun part locating the pool... it is not even on the property but across the street at a KOA camp ground. we asked 2 staff members where it was  The first girl said " I don't know this place be\very well just from the parking lot to my area, second a maintenance guy who said we had to go down stairs walk across the 4 lanes of traffic and it was there ..  we found it walked in and it was a mess of wet towels people passed out, low end looking ghetto crowd baby diapers under lawn chairs ...Used  spilled/ vomited  red looking stuff all over a lamp post  and pool deck. it was like wow  what a shit hole! . Then the life guard blows the whistle after we finally just got our drink and was told the pool was closed ...I said the front desk said 9 pm?.  he said no 8pm so now the dreaded walk back through the run down hallways and maze of stairs , escalators and elevators  and shoulder shrugging unhelpful staff .. we left  on checking out I received a bill on my credit card  for an additional $161.00 on top of the $92  a total of $253.25 .  when I was quoted on line at $75 a night .  beware  DO NOT HAVE THE SAME HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ..  I think this hotel is just waiting to be demolished and is a MGM tax write off as a slum.
