My Dad and wife accompanied me here a few nights ago for a much needed recharge of some good ole' Komex fusion food.  This was our experience:. . Food:  Between all of us we ordered a half order of the combo fried rice, pork belly masubi with egg, a pork tostada, an order of pork wanton, and a cheese quesadilla. The combo fried rice was very good and went off well with all of us (the shrimp were the really small cocktail shrimp).  I like my pork belly a little more tender than our masubi; however, it was okay.  The pork wantons were good. and the cheese quesadilla was also good; however our waitress referred to it as a "Fusion quesadilla"...it was just a tortilla and white cheese, there were no fusion ingredients.  The pork tostada was surprisingly not very good at all, I didn't taste any Asian fusion flavors.  The fusion tostada bed or "fried" rice was soggy and clearly wasn't fried like the previous times we've sampled it.  The fact that the pork tostada wasn't cooked like Sonny cooked it and the fusion quesadilla had no fusion just disappointed me.. . Service:  We loved our server!  She was so nice and had a very positive spirit.  She was fast, courteous, kept our drinks filled and delivered an accurate order.. . Atmosphere:  I would highly suggest hiring a commercial cleaning business to do a full-service cleaning of Komex.  There was so much dirt caked onto the lower trim of the walls and floor, I was simply in shock that they let it get so dirty. . . Price:  Not too bad.. . Overall,. . In my opinion: Komex Fusion (*Decatur Location Only*) went down hill since their Yelp Stardom peaked, since the new location opened, and since the owners decided to focus on the Buffalo location as the primary.  What bothers me most is the fact that they started out so good.  I know exactly what happened; but really, what happened?
My favorite type of fusion food is no doubt Korean and Mexican! The bulgogi burrito (with added kimchi) at KoMex was tasty.  The burrito was tightly packed with ingredients evenly distributed. Each bite was very satisfying with a good amount of bulgogi, mexican rice, cilantro, onions, etc. Their hot sauce rack has a variety of hot sauce with different flavor and spiciness level which makes it very fun to try. . . We also tried the spam musubi and pork belly musubi. The musubi are on the thin side and with less rice than the ones I usually have. Nothing too special about these two. The complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole was very nice. And service was attentive and friendly. I'd be back!
Quick friendly service once we got a table. Loved the tacos and nachos. Looking forward to another visit to try more of the menu.
If there was a fashion statement for food, it would definitely be fusion food! A lot of restaurants are trying different combinations and mixes and I think the best would be Korean and Mexican fusion food. When I found out about KoMex, I knew I had to give it a try. After reading the Yelp reviews and looking through pictures, I was impressed and my stomach was speaking to me... like it needed some KoMex! I'm just kidding, but really though, I was impressed now the only thing was to try it! . . There are two locations in Las Vegas now. When I first found out about this place, the only location was the one on Decatur/Washington. (I have yet to try the new one located on Buffalo/Flamingo). The location is somewhere more north of Las Vegas so a lot of the buildings are older and smaller. The plaza where it is located is in a plaza where there is a limited parking spot. Every time I go, I find a parking spot so i'm sure its not that bad! The moment you walk in, the restaurant is small, but it smells so good! Service is great! You are greeted immediately and sat down to a table.. . Every table gets a complimentary chips and salsa with guacamole. The guacamole is so good and taste very fresh! Everything on the menu is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant except it says "Fusion" before it. I thought it was funny! Anyway, some of the food that I have tried:. . Fusion tacos- I usually get the pork belly tacos and the bulgogi tacos with flour tortillas. Oh man, oh man... what can I say about the pork belly tacos... IT'S AMAZING! The pork is so fatty and cooked perfectly! Its not tough and its so juicy! They put the pico on top with shredded lettuce and the sauces that the server gives you once your food is ready! Bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine! The beef is cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness to it! All the tacos are delicious and you have a choice of flour tortillas or have them with a lettuce wrap!. . Pork-belly fries- Okay, by now I think you should get the hint that I love pork belly. One of my guilty pleasures! Think of carne asada fries, but with pork belly and the special sauces that they add and jalapenos! It is that good! Must try for yourself!. . Pork-belly musubi- It was a special at that time, but i'm sure you can order it. Just like spam musubi, they replace it with pork-belly. It was a bit too oily for me so I wouldn't really order it as much. Only when I crave for it!. . Fusion chimicanga- I had this with bulgogi and man.. its HUGE! I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good nonetheless!. . My favorite here would definitely be the tacos. Man, i'm getting hungry just writing this review.
We found this place on Yelp! Thanks for all the previous reviews! . . We were greeted by friendly staff and we're seated. We had just enough time to study the menu. Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now! . . I'll definitely be back!
Been here about 4x now - close to my work.  I had heard they had fantastic tacos - and they DO.  Love the blend of Mexican/Korean fusion.  Flavors are awesome.  Go try it out - you won't be disappointed and you can walk out for less than $10.  I keep going back to tacos - had the burrito once.  Bulgogi tacos - so good.  Service for the limited staff - just excellent - they take care of you.
They seated us within a few Minutes which was nice, they were busy but not packed. . Our waitress (her name wasn't on the check and she did not wear a name tag) was very nice and helped me by explaining the vegetarian options. I got the tofu torta and it was awesome! I love when people are so helpful in explaining menu alternatives. My friends really liked their (meat) dishes as well.
Never a let down, I look forward to Komex every time I visit Vegas. The menu is fun and vegetarian friendly. The service is wonderful, they definitely have a very family run environment. I suggest this place to all my friends coming to town.
The food choices are good here. Service is always friendly. The servers know and always welcome return guests. Affordable and portions are according to prices. Will be back as usual.
I saw this place in an old RJ Best of LV poll as best tacos which seemed weird to think of as a Korean Taco.  I was really surprised how good these tacos were.  I ordered a trio of tacos which came very quickly.  One was spicy pork, one was chicken, and one was Bulgogi beef.  I liked the spicy pork the best.  I also ordered an order of Pork Belly musubi which was tasty, but not a great deal for $6.  Tacos are an excellent price for $2 each.  I will try this place again.  The staff was really helpful and explained everything when I said this was my first time eating Korean tacos.  They also have a straight up Mexican menu, but I like Asian so I decided to give it a go.   Two thumbs up.
This is more of a 3.5.  I was going to put 4 stars for the chicken fusion flautas I got but I have to take 0.5 off because I found a toothpick in it.  Apparently it was there to keep the flautas rolled and it was not taken out properly.  The manager did take off the $8 from the total of the check though.. . Other than that, it seemed to be a popular place at lunch.  There was even a reserved sign on one of the back tables.
BEWARE! Did takeout here today and was charged $42 for 6 tacos, full pork plate and 2 calypso lemonades and I've got the bank statement to prove it. Being new here, I did not question the price but checked the menu pricing found online a little later. What a jip. Never again.
O KoMex, what a fantastic fusion feast . from this oasis to my east.. Since I live on the west coast,. I do not mean to boast. but I wanted to explain my positioning in the least.. . The fusion of cultures and foods were actually above par.. When mixing Bulgogi and Flautas, it was great and bazar.. But the place settings were were decorated with folklore from China,. which is something I'd expect in South Carolina;. I don't think they really know who they are.. . Mexican, Korean, and a little Chinese,. with food so great it brought me to my knees.. Though I would be remiss if I forgot to mention their sauce,. it was their winning combination that made them so boss.. I will always accept your fusion guac with a thank you and please.. . The wait staff was nice,. they accommodated our vegetarian not once, but twice.. Was it the greatest? I do not think so,. but I'd highly recommend that you all go.. This is one place in Vegas you won't need to roll the dice...
Really not impressed with this place, the meat hardly tastes marinated & the service sucked.. Server never offered me a water & Its getting to the point I'm going to grab my own to go box!!!
KoMex was out of the way but it was an anticipated foodie stop on a weekend Vegas trip.  I had just read a magazine article where their Fusion Burrito was actually rated one of the very best in the entire US!  Now that's really setting a high level of expectation.. . We stopped by for a midafternoon mini meal to just share a couple of items.  The Fusion Burrito with pork bulgogi was good but it didn't blow me away by any means.  Maybe I'm jaded by thenumerous good burritos from SoCal. The Fusion Fries with beef bulgogi were slightly disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the fries themselves and the toppings were on the skimpy side.. . The service here was very nice and friendly and that counts for a lot. . . I've had Korean fusion food in SoCal too and I thought I've had better back at home.  I highly recommend Urban Seoul in Irvine.    . . I've crossed KoMex off of my Vegas Eating Bucket List and it's now on to other places!
Cheap! Hits the spot. . . It was good homemade Korean food fused with more than decent Mexican food. Another good place to go if you're on a budget in Vegas.
