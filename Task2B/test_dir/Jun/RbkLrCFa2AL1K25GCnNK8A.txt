Pretty shocked at all the terrible reviews on Yelp about this hotel!. . My wife, her best friend and I stayed here while in Vegas to see Guns N Roses.  Rachelle checked us in and was totally awesome!  She was pleasant, professional and had us checked in quickly and efficiently. I would say it took no longer than five minutes to check in on a Saturday afternoon.. . The rooms were really nice.  New interior, two queen beds, a comfortable couch, a chair w/ottoman and a desk.  After getting settled we noticed that one of the beds had a chenille bedspread and one did not.  I called the front desk and let them know.  Five minutes later there was a knock at the door and one was delivered.. . The bathroom was clean but a little on the small side.  One person getting ready at a time is about the max.  The tub is certainly big enough for two.. . You cannot beat the price for the quality of the hotel.  No, I don't like having to pay the resort fee either but this is pretty standard these days.  I experienced great service here - check in, maid service, the casino and the valet.
Do not stay here!! Horrible customer service with a "if you don't like it, you can cancel" attitude. They are supposed to give you vouchers per night when you choose to opt out of their housekeeping, never happened! After requesting our vouchers multiple times, we just gave up. After 3 nights of opting out, we didn't get one single voucher. Scammers! . . Hygiene is also a factor. Mold in tubs and hair on bedroom sheets, ew! . . It comes to no surprise why they are rated so poorly.... No surprise! . . If I could give it 0 stars, I would!
I was shockingly "impressed" with the room. It wasn't anything spectacular but after the reviews I had read online, prior to my visit, I was a little nervous. The one thing that did annoy me was that I booked through my airline as a package deal, upon arriving the hotel clerk told me I owed another $85 for the resort fees since they weren't charged in the package deal. Had I known this, for the price I paid, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel on the strip somewhere.. . When I got there the light in the bathroom was burnt out but there was a maintenance guy knocking on our door 20 minutes later. Apparently the maid had put in a ticket for service.. . The bathroom is my biggest complaint. It smelled like mildew and was not clean at all. I felt like I was still dirty after showering. The shower curtain was ripped and the drain was disgustingly rusty. Surprisingly, the toilet was pretty clean but it didn't flush very well. Additionally, the water pressure in the shower sucked! It took me 20 min to rinse my hair because the stream was so weak.. . The room layout was spacious and even had a very decent sized desk for me to work while on vacation. The bed sheets were (to my knowledge) clean enough. I was afraid to inspect them much more.. . The staff was friendly and moved us to a "nicer" room when we arrived because he said our room was one of the oldest ones they had. Its a $20 up-charge for a renovated room.. FYI.
I love this place 22 dollars for the room, only stayed a night but it was cool won on a couple slots, I think I would stay again.
Its true what they say, "you get for what you pay for".  From the start of our visit, the room was dirty.  The bathroom was obviously used, bed was undone, there was beer cans in the trash, and the sink was filled with dirty water! Really!!!  I call room service which took them a good 20 minutes to get here, not to mention the other 10 to 15 minutes it took the maid to clean it.  On top of all of this, the ice machine was broken, the TV remote did not work, and there was no mini fridge.  I digress, really!!  Its true that its the cheapest of the bunch, but come on, really?!!  I caution everyone before they book a room here.  It would of been nice if they comp the room for us or at least give us another room.  Oh by the way, i'm still waiting for the engineers to come to my room and fix the TV/remote control.  Been waiting 20 minutes now.  Only nice thing about this place, is that its right next to the monoreal which drops you of on the strip.
Worst experience ever. Went on memorial day weekend.. I book online for 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each. We get there, check in, go to our rooms. We get rooms with 1 king bed each. Okay I guess this is a mistake, they can fix it right? Nope. We go back down to the front desk and tell them, and they have no other rooms available. Now let's step back for a bit. Why the fuck are these guys gonna even approve my request online if they don't have the available rooms? Why waste my time like that? I'd rather have them deny us service because of unavailability rather than LIE TO MY FACE.. Anyways, they say there's nothing they can do, it's late so we just deal with it. However, the front desk says that we can call for aroller bed for free because of the inconvenience. Alright that's cool I guess. We go up and call for it. Guess what. We had to pay. I tell room service on the phone that front desk told me it was free, then they make me hold for way too long I just give up. LIED TO AGAIN LOL! . About 3 hours later I call again and it finally comes. Only one though, we needed 2.... So this place is complete bullshit, don't waste your money here.. Also buffet is utter horse crap, it's like ~$30 for adult and the food is old, stale, and not fresh. Crab legs are dirty and greenish. Oysters are obviously spoiled (you can tell by looking, smelling, or tasting them). And the shrimp is store bought and frozen. . Last thing, elevators here suck. 6 elevators for 25+ floors and it takes 40 minutes to catch one. Not to mention that the down elevators sometimes malfunction and go up and vice-versa. . RECAP:. Bad food, bad service, bad elevators, bad hotel. just bad in general. Not worth even $20 to stay here in my honest opinion. Go spend like $15 more for a hotel that'll actually give you some sort of service. Fuck off LVH.
The LVH is hands down the best deal in Vegas. We have been coming here for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. It is our Go to hotel for large family and friend get togethers. The casino is the perfect size- we can always find each other- and gambling here is so much fun. The dealers and pit bosses are just so friendly and personable. They remember you ! If you do get a players card,no one  treats you better than the LVH.  Period. . The restaurants here are amazing. We stayed here 2 weeks ago for our anniversary and tried everything. TJs steakhouse was outstanding with impeccable service. BeniHanas  had gorgeous ambiance, absolute top quality food,and again, superior service. We even went to the Hamburger Bistro for a quick lunch and were pleasantly shocked. It was great!  It's beautiful and the food was perfect. . The men played golf through the LVH st the private Las Vegas c&c. They said the course was in excellent shape and the cost was  only 1/3 of what they pd  the last time they golfed in Vegas. The ladies went to the spa for  a facial and massage and were equally thrilled. The service is truly amazing.- from check in to the attendants in the locker/ spa area. You really feel like a VIP. We even booked a cabana after the men golfed. It was only $150. Was it fancy? No,but it had the fan,tv,fridge and lots of people bringing us lots of good  food and drinks. We were happy! Last year at a different Vegas hotel for a seminar, we paid $600 for a cabana. Just nuts. . Oh and entertainment. We just saw Mo5saic  and loved it so much we  are spreading the word.  We dragged our men to the show and they adored it. It is a screaming deal. Don't miss it. . Rooms. We have always been perfectly happy with the regular classic rooms, but this trip we upgraded to a suite and LVH blew us away. It was huge and gorgeous and the entire staff made us feel special.  A big shout out to the ladies in the VIP lounge. . . I don't write Yelp reviews,but I read them. I was so surprised by the unfortunate comments  and experiences  shared by others, I felt compelled to share mine.
I had a fantastic time. This hotel was a great value for the dollar, and it was right next to the monorail. I actually groupon'ed my room, and I couldn't have been happier.. . Sure there was some resort fees and taxes that were a bit more than expected, but I really enjoyed the amenities.. . Pool was filled with kids, the dj played 90s tunes, but you know what, I really had a relaxing time.. . Their casino is generous and very fun & I won $1247 there! I'll be back.
there are no managers around when you want to complain. The first room had a mildew smell. second room had problem with the A/C. Coffee costs $3.50...not free. a jr suite is just two rooms with a connecting door. Don't opt for that upgrade. Furniture was just left in the hallway. water is not hot. get the north tower. east tower is not as good.
I have to say I was a bit apprehensive after the negative reviews, but lvh was good to me...upgraded my room because it was my honeymoon for only 10 dollars more..That got us a Grand Room with a fridge, coffee maker, couch, ottoman, double beds, vanity area and a huge bathroom. ..Their showerhead weas amazing and we had no problems with water draining or pressure...Sure there are little dings and dents but lets be honest this is not the Wynn or Belliago ....For 200 bucks for 4 days 3 nights I would surely stay there again and they were very hospitable down to the housekeepers...
not bad, but we had major issues.  If not for the good price and nice quality of the room, I would have given it one star.  LVH (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton) is definitely not a Hilton.  It was old, run-down in most parts, but the room we got was newly renovated and even comfortable when you first walk in.  But then later you find it has issues.  . . We had an initial problem that we had our neighboring room smoking, and their smoke got into our room.  Terrible when you are trying to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your room is full of smoke and noise.. . The other big problem is that the walls are paper thin.  You can hear conversations and noise from all around.  I could hear kids crying outside, the couple in the room next to us arguing and crying, it was strange and uncomfortable.  And the pool looked totally dirty.  So many people, you can hardly find a place to sit around or even stand in the pool.  It's not relaxing at all, but seemed most people were not there for relaxing, more to party.. . Not a good hotel and I was very disappointed.
This is the worst hotel ever. I travel to Vegas on a monthly basis to get away. I've stayed at dozens of different hotels before. This was the first time I've stayed at the LVH, and it will be the last time. . . When I first arrived to the LVH, I immediately noticed the type of crowd this hotel attracts. The majority of the crowd here appeared to be from the Bronx or from the ghetto. The hotel itself was out dated, old, and in need of remodeling. My room smelled like an old ashtray, the mattress caved in, and the bathroom was crusty along the edges.. . The people who stayed across the room from mine were drug addicts. These people were wired up and did not sleep. For 2 days and nights, these people played loud music, yelling, screaming using profanity. I could not sleep a wink. Eventually, someone made a complaint to the front desk about all the noise. The front desk sent security to warn these people. Unfortunately, this made these people more angry. They began to turn the music full blast. They heard that someone made a complaint against them, so they retaliated against all the nearby rooms including mine. They starting kicking on my door, cursing and using threats. I was so stressed out, I had to cut my stay short.. . I called the front desk to complain, but they didn't seem to care much. This was the worst experience I ever had staying in Vegas. Do yourself a favor, pay the extra money and stay at a nicer hotel. I would give the LVH zero stars if that was possible. This hotel is absolutely awful!!!
First off this hotel is NOT the Las Vegas Hilton rather it is the Las Vegas Hotel.  I think they count on people being confused to get room bookings...read some of the reviews on the various travel sites.  I booked my boss into a room at this hotel at the last minute (late decision to attend an industry convention) since the rest of LV was sold out due to the convention he was attending.  When I asked him about this hotel upon his return he just started laughing and then said that he now understood why the room was so cheap.  He did not go into detail, but he did shudder when recalling the place. He said that if he had been there for any reason besides the convention he would have moved to another hotel - any other hotel.  Thank goodness my boss is an easy going guy.  Think about it, how bad is it that the hotel RIGHT NEXT DOOR to the convention center still had rooms available a couple of days before a HUGE convention!?. . Two bright spots - My boss did not bring a receipt home with him for the stay.  I called the accounting department to request a copy of his folio and it was in my inbox before I even got off of the phone.  Way to go accounting gal!  My boss did comment on how handy it was to be staying right next to the convention center.
Who could ask for anything more? I like it because it's a little removed from the action.The monorail is cheap and takes you right to the strip- which doesn't take long and runs til 2am- but if you want to be stumbling distance from da club at all hours, this is not for you. . Beautiful room, super spacious and clean with updates and a nice view.. They have this great deal right now where if you "go green" by passing on cleaning services- you get an $8 voucher for food. I saved mine up and ate like a fat renaissance queen at the buffet. Free unlimited wine? Hell yes I did.. The pool area was really pretty but should be open later for adults.
This hotel is everything I like in a vacation get away, the rooms are nice, clean, and everything worked, good staff, an excellent restaurant and great rate deals. It is away from the maddening crowd but close enough to walk to the action, it is behind the Riviera Hotel. I always enjoy my stay here.read lessKerry, this is TED's featured talk of today and
I just finished my stay here for a trade show. I stayed June 17 2014 - June 20 2014. . . Short version- This place sucks. If you smoke and want to stumble between slot machines and your room, then maybe you'd have a good time. . . Long version - . . Arrival - the bell staff at the curb side were less than friendly. No offer for assistance with baggage, no welcoming feeling. Walking in you're greeted with a plume of cigarette smoke, which to most nowadays is very unpleasant. The main entrance drops you right into their casino.The front desk staff is nice enough, but not overwhelmingly happy you're there with them. I asked for a non smoking floor / non smoking room. After checking in, I made my way to the elevators. Got up to my room (10th floor), and went about unpacking. . . Hotel room - old carpet, a bathroom which looks like it's from my grandmothers house, and an air conditioning system which just crap. There must be something screwy with their HVAC system as it seems all of the cigarette smoke from the casino just gets pulled up into your room. Entering the room, the stench of cigarette smoke was even worse than the casino. The television signal was shoddy, with fuzz and blanking images. Getting over the room, I unpacked and went out for dinner. Unfortunately is didn't do a quality check on the bed before leaving.... . Getting home rather late, I went back to my room. Pulled down the covers and was greeted with sheets which had cigarette burns in them. Awesome. Called house keeping which took 45 min to arrive. The attendant was kind, changed my sheets and I preceded to go to bed. . . Woke up the next morning and took a shower. The water is either scalding hot or freezing cold. Awesome. . . Cab drivers always know what's a good place and what's a bad place. The fact that there was always a 30 min line for cabs told me something was up. . . This place lives and dies on conventions. It's  not really "attached" to the convention center, although you only need to cross 1 street. . . There is a little restaurant where many eat breakfast in the am. Called "paradise". Trust me. It's not. My friend and I got each :. 1 omelet. 1 coffee . 1 juice . Side bacon . Side white bread toast. . The total without tip came to $58. Wow.    . . Highly would not recommend you stay here. Spend a few extra bucks and stay somewhere a bit nicer. You'll be happy you did. . . This place needs a major overhaul.
The hotel itself is alright. You have restaurants, the casino, nice rooms... Standard Vegas. I am taking off three stars for their inability to filter white trash from the pool area. It's like every hillbilly and their mother and grandmother decided the LVH pool was the prime get together spot to be vulgar and simply classless....play music that attracts attractive people. Don't play music that attracts an obese hoe down party. Come on DJ!
I live in LA and come to Vegas quite a bit for both personal and business reasons. I'm not your regular tourist and i don't go for the over priced hotels like the Wynn or the Venetian. Most of the time I stay at The Orleans. Those of you familiar with The Orleans know it is not pretentious, but has some great amenities that are free or affordable. . . This time I planned a last minute trip and The Orleans was sold out. So Expedia had a great rate for The Hilton or LVH as they are now calling themselves. I got 2 nights (weekdays) for $150 including the resort fee. I hate resort fees. But anyway..... . I checked in on a Monday night. Check in way easy and so was finding my room. Unfortunately when I got to my room there were several problems: a broken phone, a clogged sink, and a non working safe. And I have to add it was a very odd looking room with a good deal of unused space. . . I called down to the operator (there is no front desk) button. I was bounced around from the operator to the front desk a few times as no one at the front desk was picking up. Once someone did pick up I was put on hold for quite some time. Finally when someone answered they told me to come down to the front desk and they would switch my room. . . The switch was done easily and the room was nicer in general (east tower).  But the safe in my new room didn't work either. I called down to the front desk and they asked me if they should send someone up. Stupid question and of course I said yes. . . It took about 30?minutes but 2 polite maintenance workers came up. They fixed it easily. It seems as the previous occupant was a comedian and decided to lock a water bottle in the safe before he left. That was he end of the night. . . Today I strayed off by looking for the buffet. Although the hotel book in my room said it was open for breakfast it wAs not. So I left the hotel and went about my day. . . When I returned I laid out at their pool. The pool area is really nice and I consider it the highlight of the hotel. I will try to enjoy this again in the morning before I head back to LA. Now the day is over and I tried to get some water from the vending machine. I had to go to 3 different floors until I found one that worked. . . I won't say I won't ever stay here again. But it isn't my first choice, second choice or even third. If I ever need a room last minute and all my other choices are unavailable or priced to high I would consider it.
If I could give it a zero, I would. The most pathetic service ever. A 40 min wait for this? Tons of empty tables. Apparently no one likes working here. If I were Vince Neil, I'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this place.
This hotel has some positive aspects, but overall, I would stay somewhere else.  Just stayed there and here are my observations:. . 1. Food Options - times are terrible.  Food is not readily available and several places are closed at odd times.  Sometimes feels like you are forced to eat at one place because it's the only restaurant open.  Buffet times are limited, Deli times are limited.  Limited to coffee shop and maybe a pizza place.. . 2. Valet Service - IS TERRIBLE!  If you pay for quicker service when retrieving your car, a.k.a. giving a valet driver a $10 or $20 in the corner, you will get your car right away.  If not, you will wait and wait and wait.  This was tested and proven and the valet office staff will tell you that if you're willing to do this, you WILL get your car quicker.. . 3. No fun for kids - nothing for kids to do at this hotel except to use the pool.. . I would highly recommend to stay somewhere else when looking for a good Las Vegas experience.
I should have known better.  Yes, it seemed handy for the trade show (we didn't realize it was in S Hall and tried walking...big mistake in 105 degree weather) and it does have a monorail station.  . We'd stayed here about 5 years ago and were given an occupied room(!). It was mortifying.  But I thought w/new owners and a re-do, it was worth trying.  Never, ever again.. It wasn't very clean.  Someone had either spilled a tray from room service or thrown up outside our room. It had been hastily wiped up.  I pointed it out to one of the housekeepers but it remained for the duration of our stay.  . There was literally no hot water in the morning...none.  So we had to shower/wash our hair in cold water. This was a business trip!  We needed to look decent. Not a fun way to start day.  . Food choices were mediocre, at best.  The only plus is that their staff was cordial.. Everything about it felt like it catered to lowest common denominator
This hotel is cheap, easily located by the monorail for cheap travel ideas to downtown. However, my room was dirty, so I had to switch. Both times I have stayed there was no hot water. I thought maybe the first time was a fluke.... I was wrong. I won't book another trip with them. But it's cheap.....
My job requires me to travel a lot, and my boss told me to change my flight home to a flight to Vegas to assist one of my colleagues with a training event. When I'm at Vegas I normally stay at MGM-owned hotel because I'm an mLife member, but this was the weekend of the Mayweather fight and it was also the first week of the NBA playoffs so I was bound to spend an arm and a leg.. . LVH showed up on the HotelsTonight queue and it didn't seem half bad.  For a good price I ended up getting a very spacious corner unit and free Wi-Fi.  That's something you don't get at some of the best hotels at the strip.  While the room looked good, it was when I got to the bed where things got weird.. . The bed in my room looked to be one of those that flips over to the wall.  While I have no issue with that, the gap between the mattress and wall had so much lint and dust that is quite scary looking.  Don't get me wrong, the bed was clean, but the upkeep of what was behind it was rather concerning.. . Anyway, the TV sucked too, because the quality was horrible but the hotel did exactly what it needed to do for me.. . I'm guessing the spot is pretty old.  I hear it was the old Hilton, and all the dealers and people at the casino seemed a little older.  But that doesn't matter.  I won big at the craps table that night, and the shooters were all hot.  I was a bit afraid because everybody looked intimidating... I won't go into too much detail, but hey -- I won, and that's all that matters.. . I'll look into this place if I come into another situation where I can't use my mLife card.  But I hope they fix that bed situation.  The location IS off strip, but the monorail is here and it's very affordable, so that shouldn't dissuade anybody from saving money and staying here.
The ordinary in-room coffee comes in a sealed cup. You're charged $3.50 to open the cup!  This on top of the $19/day mandatory resort fee adds insult to their penny wise and pound foolish injury.  Convention organizers- organize your convention somewhere else.
I booked a room here literally as I stepped into the hotel & it was still very affordable including then resort fee. It's a bit off the strip but there's a very low cost monorail that will go straight into the strip if you're worried about cab fare cost! The room itself wasn't bad, but the bathroom could use some major renovation. It reminded me of a cheap motel layout. I had a pleasant experience over all
For $40 a night on a Saturday night.. Why not!!! I don't come to Vegas for a fancy hotel. Who stays in their hotel all day while traveling..? I come to Vegas so much.. I don't care where I stay. This place was nice, and clean.. The beds were very comfortable and relaxing.. The pool area is kinda big, but there was too many little kids in the pool! Not so much fun!! . . This hotel is kinda far from the main attractions and strip. But, you can take a taxi to the strip for about 11 dollars maxi, that includes tip! . . This hotel really doesn't have many food places to eat from. It's a standard hotel! The front desk people were a little rude and not fast enough to check people in.
