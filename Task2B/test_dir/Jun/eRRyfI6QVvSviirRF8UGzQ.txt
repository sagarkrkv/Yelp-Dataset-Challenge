encore parlor suite - great view of the strip; great service and my favorite casino to stay at in Las Vegas (best people)
Wow just wow. I have been to hotels all over the country and world, but the level of service and pampering that occurs at the encore is top notch. From the first contact with employees to the last is always pleasant and engaging. My partner and myself visit Vegas frequently, we will not stay anywhere other than encore. The rooms are very transitional aesthetically and exceptionally well appointed. My favorite part aside from the rooms and service is the pool/spa. Even if you do not enjoy the spa, you must visit just to see stunning design, details, and service. The pool, i always opt for the European pool, not for the sights, but for the no children atmosphere. The pool cocktail servers are constantly anticipating your needs, which seems to be a recurring thing at this resort. The best days for the pool, while might be crowded are Saturday and Sunday, as a dj is playing some sort of edm music. I am a lover of all things room service, and encore room service really delivers on the room service. Some of the best dinners I have had in Vegas were encore room service. Also, if you need a night of recovery, order a movie and room service. Room service has a movie night package, which consists of candy, popcorn, and sodas.. . Worth the hype.
The hotel and check-in staff are excellent but the Encore pool and cabana situations have deteriorated.  The cabanas are worn and the furniture is extremely beaten and chipped.    We also had left over trash (a straw and a beer can) in ours.  While I realize it's a club at night that contributes to wear and tear, the $300/day charge (not including drink and food service) was very excessive given the quality of the experience. . . We also heard a group complain that there was a sign disallowing European bathing due to a private event.  [Nothing worse than checking into a hotel only to have private events limit the expected common facilities without prior notice].  Nevertheless, the private event never seemed to materialize at any point in the day.. . Sadly, they've also removed the fantastic "Sugar & Spice/Pizza/Dessert" cafe from the Wynn esplanade and replaced it with a Givenchy.    This was a great cafe where one could have lunch, coffee, dessert, etc. away from the smoke of the casino while watching the waterfalls from the outside patio.. . The last day we order breakfast per room service for six am in that we had to catch a flight.  Although room service had been on time before, they somehow missed us. After placing 2 calls to dining services, it finally arrived at 6:30 as we were about to head out the door.. . No new shows here. We saw Danny Ganns (he was the greatest!) and Beyonce here.  The Wynn desperately needs some new artists, if only for special events.  . . Curiously, although we've been to the Encore several times since opening and they still ask us at check in if we've visited before. Also, at check out no one asked us how our stay was. Unfortunately overall, the quality of the stay has gone done a notch.
From the beginning the staff was not very accommodating starting at checkin where the only way I could check in was to upgrade (around noon).   The first room I checked into prior to that had so much perfumed rug cleaner it was hard to breathe, again problems with the front desk changing this.    . . Also all the club patrons make the cab lines excessively long.  I was visiting on business and had to leave a half an hour early to make sure I got a cab.    . . Also traveling by yourself here seems to be an anomaly.  The restaurant staff at wazuzu made me pay for my meal halfway though so I could go to the bathroom.  This despite having my room number and name on file.  The manager explained that they needed collateral from patrons so they did not walk out.   It was offensive.   . . I will stay again at the aria, bellagio, or palazzo in the future.   All three hotels offer an equally high user experience without the high handedness that seems to be pervasive here.
Great service! Friendly staff! Happy people!  And the suites are gorgeous! It made my trip to EDC 2014 super comfy:) and live their late check out at 8 pm :)
Oh, Encore...how do I love thee. For two people who had not been to Vegas in over 10 years it says a lot that our third visit in less than a year is in a week.. . The hotel is gorgeous and filled with light. The service is impeccable (Hello to Darlene at The Buffet and the bartenders at The Vault) we felt pampered the entire time. The Encore made me enjoy a vacation where we really just did nothing.. . And...hint...the perfect place for an "adult" Thanksgiving is The Encore . . We'll see you for the 4th if July!
Excellent decore. Only Wynn and Encore have remained my best favorite hotels to stay,  favorite second would be city center complexes.. . Interior is lavish and rooms are well designed. . . I Prefere encore rooms over Wynn, more my style.
Until 5:30 this morning I would have rated this five stars, but having to deal with drunk smokers while trying to find a cup of coffee really put me off. The cafe doesn't open until 6am and we had an early flight to catch. I was directed to the East Bar which was packed with drunk 20-something smokers. Really off-putting--some of Encore's guests *are* grown-ups. The hotel itself is gorgeous (aside from the smoke) and our room was really nice (aside from a torn duvet cover and a lack of outlets in useful places.). . We had several meals here and one big plus is that my allergies were easily handled--with absolutely no hesitation or trouble. Dinner at Red 8 was fantastic. Breakfast at Society Cafe was meh (the omelet was dry--overcooked and maybe had been sitting?) but the way my allergies were handled was impressive. . . I was fully prepared to only stay at Encore any time I'm in Vegas but after this morning, I'm not entirely certain I'll be back. While I don't need to find the Senior Center just yet, I would rather stay in a hotel that caters to adults, not the club crowd.
This is my wife and mine's favorite place to stay in Vegas. We have stayed at many of the resorts in Vegas like wynn,  Venetian, MGM, cosmo and the encore is just prefect did us. We love how relaxing and clean everywhere is at the encore. Service is consistently great everywhere. The rooms are large and they have great rates at times and don't make you always pay the resort fee if you don't want to use this like the gym. This saves a great deal of money. It is easy to get to and is on the strip. The pools are nice and summer at very air and relaxing.
I love staying here! The only down side is that it's on the end of the strip. It's nice if you only want to go to xs, surrender, or ebc. Which is where most of the headliners play. The rooms are 10/10 and of course their bathrooms are above and beyond of what is expected. . Be careful not to knock over any of the purchasable items or you will be charged.
Checking in took about 20 minutes. The girl that helped us at the front desk was less than friendly. She missed a lot of details. We had to pay $50 to get two queen beds. Couch wasn't very comfortable. TV is oddly placed. Had a great view of the strip on the 57th floor. There are red glittery butterflies and dragonflies everywhere. It looks like a 10 year old girl decorated the lobby and casino. I won't be staying here again. . . If you want a variety of nice restaurants, and to go to the beach club, and xs nightclub, and don't care about having any cheap options like walgreens and food court, then I'm sure you'll like it. Otherwise, stay at the palazzo.
