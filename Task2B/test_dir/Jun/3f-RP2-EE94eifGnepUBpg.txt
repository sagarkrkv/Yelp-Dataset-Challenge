This is my 3rd cirque du soleil. Wholesome, enjoyable show especially if you are a big fan of the beatles. Very good presentation and sequencing of the production but lesser laugh and acrobatics than mystere. My seat was close to the stage  cause i got a discounted deal online but i believe every seat is a good seat so dont spend too much on the tickets.
If you're looking for something very entertaining to watch while in Vegas you must check out the Beatles Love show. It had acrobatic acts, dance, and light shows along with the Beatles songs on the background that will surely leave you mesmerized.
This show had many more slow moments and group dance numbers than previous Cirque du Soleil shows we have been to, and also focused a little more on the psychedelic aspects than I expected. It actually felt a bit repetitious with the group dance numbers and aerial ropes dancing. I feel like these shows typically have more variety in the types of acts, but each of these occurred at least 3 times in the show as the primary focal point.. . There were three great unusual and/or fast paced acts, though - a skaters' ramp, trampoline act, and a giant sheet that enveloped the audience for Yellow Submarine.. . For seating, my advice is to sit at least halfway up to have a better panorama of the stage since they perform in the middle of the audience, and you will then not have to crane your neck upwards as much to see the performers.
This was my 2nd time seeing Love it was just as awesome this time around as it was the 1st if your a fan of the beatles you will absolutely love this show it is by far one of the better Cirque Soleil shows and the music is awesome its a win win, there is no a bad seat in the house
LOVE THIS SHOW!! So very entertaining, colorful, FUN, amazing performance!! This is a show I would pay to see again!!
Not the best Cirque show in town.  No show of athleticism on the level of KA.  If you enjoy music from the Beatles, go see this show.  If you enjoy watching performers dressed up in costume dancing around to Beatles music, go see this show.  Luckily for me, I ended up getting free tickets, so no money wasted.  My time watching this show, however, I can never get back.
Definitely a dance oriented Soleil show.  It has spurts of great performances but sadly, it lost me at a couple segments and I even fell asleep for one part.  If you are a huge Beatles fan, you have to come see this.  But for someone who has seen quite a few Soleil shows, I wouldn't put this at the top.  There is no crowd interaction as well. Don't get me wrong, the dancing is very well done, but I feel there is more to Soleil show's than dancing, and in consideration of that, LOVE slips on the rating.
I wish I could share the experience of this show with everyone I know. Incredible. Amazing. Beautiful. Funny. Moving. Emotionally uplifting. A little more Love in the world would be a great thing!
I've been in showbiz for 40+ years. This is the most original and theatrical show I've ever seen. I wasn't a Beatles music fan, until I saw this show. I've seen it three times now and can't wait to go back.. . UPDATE -- Saw it again last night (3 NOV 2014). Again, best show I've seen in my 41 years in show business.  This is the most theatrical, creative and spectacular show I've ever seen. It has so many layers and so, so complicated to produce, but looks effortless. THIS IS A WORK OF ART.
My first Cirque du Soleil show on my first trip to Vegas and I couldn't be happier I chose this one!!!. Obviously all the music is wonderful...because its the beetles! But the special effects, the huge screens, and of course all the performers were just spectacular!. Really enjoyed myself!!!
Not my favorite show.  Was well done as always.  Pretty busy stage, almost appeared to be over done.  I left thinking, what was the point of that? Seen many more Cirque shows, all were better shows, the quality of the show is the same, great artists.  If you are a die hard Beatles fan, I'm sure you will love it.
Absolutely amazing!! Worth every penny! I've seen every Cirque in Vegas and this is my favorite
Probably the best show I have ever seen. Definitely recommend to any Beatle lover.
I've been here twice now.   Loved it each and every time and you had better see it if you are in Vegas.. There, that's all I have to say about it. I don't want to ruin the show for you by telling you more details.
This was my first Cirque du Soleil, and I have to say.. it definitely wont be my last!!. . This was the most amazing show! Talented performers, comfortable seating and even a snack bar (I wasn't expecting that.. but AWESOME) . . If you like The Beatles at all, (and I mean, who doesn't?) this is a must while you are in Vegas! Defintiely woth paying a little extra for the better tickets, all the seats can see just fine, but being close is way better for this!
This arena is great. There is literally not a bad seat in the house. In my opinion if your debating one section over another, I'd go for the cheaper one. Even the A section, or the pit section was a little over priced for my tastes... but it is right in front of the performers, and most of the show occurs above you, so I can see why it would be cool... but honestly every seat is great. . There is a lot of beatles music, obviously, and its all performed to an amazing story where the performers bring songs to life. There are a few "strange" in between set pieces where the beatles audio recordings play to images on the screens, which is a little off putting, since the show is so methodical, and rhythmic, these scene (in my opinion) take you out of the moment and let you breath for a second. . Lucy in the sky is amazing... as are many of the songs... just visually amazing. . Be sure to look for the Summer of Cirque discounts, for nice savings on the tickets. : )
What an AMAZING show! Everything from the begining to the end took my attention. And of course, The Beatles are The Beatles, you will hear their most popular songs watching an extraordinary and speechless show. If you are local and haven't had the chance to watch it, you should. And if you are visiting Vegas, make sure you give it a try. It is a very exciting option!
This is THE BEST Show in Vegas by far. Young and old alike love this show.  Fan or not a fan of the BEATLES still the best. Best Cirque show I have ever seen. You leave with a feel good feeling and energized!
I am so glad that we left LOVE as our last big show. I wish I could have been there on stage, dancing my heart and soul out and twirling while soaring higher than the crowd. It's a very inspirational, and moving show. I cried twice! The dancers are just spectacular and the entire production was through the roof! I will most definitely be returning year after year, and maybe one day strive to be a part of the cast. Hmm... Anything can happen right?! COMECOMECOME!!!
All you need is LOVE!. . I am a huge fan of cirque du soleil shows and I'm an even huger fan of the beatles. I've been dying to watch this show since forever. To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!. . This theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.. . I was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard day's night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. It's not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather it's the most immersive show. . . In order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time! Basically, I was grinning ear to ear through out the whole show. I had a really hard time getting beatlemania out of my head. :).. . Overall, hands down the best Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever watched!
A colorful,  raucous, sometimes surreal celebration of the Beatles. At times I felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass with a Beatles soundtrack. Every member of our party thoroughly enjoyed the show.
Saw this show several years ago. It is really fun, especially for a Beatles fan like me. Think of it as a live music video show where they do many different songs.. . Not the best of the Cirque shows but still would recommend.
First time to Vegas, and as a Beatles fan, I was excited to see the show at The Mirage. Arrived at 6:30 to be seated for the showing at 7. The performance was just alright, don't get me wrong there was some amazing stunts. But nothing overwhelmingly awesome. However, the sound quality was beyond perfect! Which is why this show has 4 stars instead of 3. The pureness and rawness of the tracks they used for the show were amazing. I would go see the show again with my eyes closed, and enjoy it twice as much. Would have liked more songs to be added to it, however, considering the Beatles have such a wide range of songs to choose from. . . Don't forget to stop at the merch store before you head in! It gets super crowded after the show.
