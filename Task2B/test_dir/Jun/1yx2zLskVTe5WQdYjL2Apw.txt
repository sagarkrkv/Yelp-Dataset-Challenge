An early arrival to Vegas gives us an opportunity to go off the strip and enjoy a couple of breakfast eateries. The Egg and I has a cute name and an old cowboy ranch feel to it. The menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!. . Food (4 Stars): I ordered the corned beef hash with over medium eggs and the banana nut muffin. I'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. The seasoned potatos were DELICIOUS and I wish I could've had more.. . We ordered the Cinncinati 4 Way plate with onions. It is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. Our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. It was amazing!!! Who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? Topped with cheese and onions, this is my dish!. . We couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. The food is still good after being reheated.. . Service (4 Stars): Our cute server was friendly and humorous. She frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.. . Bottom line: Hungover? Hungry? Feeling like stuffinf your face? Egg ans I will satisfy it all.
Food is oily and covered with seasoning. Toast is burnt. What's non dairy creamer? However the service from Samantha is completely awesome and makes up for everything. Samantha gave me some real milk to go with my coffee.
Had a great breakfast there yesterday morning. Service was great; Samantha did a great job. Food order was taken promptly and food brought to our table in a timely manner.  My wife had the breakfast burrito; which she loved and I had the Portuguese sausage and eggs with the banana nut muffin (a must). Overall very please with the food, service and will return again.
So glad we found this great breakfast spot before leaving Las Vegas. The food was great and the service was excellent. Thanks Amanda
This is the second time I've eaten at Egg & I and this place is soo good for breakfast. I forgot what I got the first time I've been here. The last time I've been here I got a cold turkey sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was really simple with turkey, guacomole, tomatoe and etc. Just the usually stuff but it was good. Their french fries was a bit different, it is small and crispy...not like McDonald's or Burger King fries.  I love love love their banana nut muffin!! It is so freaking good! Everyone gotta try their banana nut muffin!. . I would definitely come back here again.
A very nice surprise.  We went here because of a food network recommendation and we were not let down.  It is a basic breakfast, but very good.
The food is nice and hot with large more than you can eat portions. . . "The works" omelette is very filling as it is very well packed.. . Don't think twice about coming here! Just do it! You won't be disappointed.. . Jose was our server, did an excellent job!
Yummy breakfast.  Wait is as expected.  I ordered the portugese sausage hawaiian breakfast because other than in Hawaii this is the only place I have been able to find it.  It is a whole sausage they don't skimp.  Good food!
The Works skillet was simply amazing! Yummy homemade salsa and the homemade muffin finished everything off nicely. Biscuits and gravy was too too
The Carnivore is in lovely Las Vegas again, to celebrate the anniversary of his nuptials to Mrs. Carnivore.  Breakfast number one was to be hosted by The Egg and I.  The carnivore loves this place for breakfast!!!. . The Carnivore had eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes.  This is his preferred restaurant breakfast.  There were no weak points.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the maple cured bacon was bacony delicious, of course.  Hash browns were in patty form, but tasted lovely, and the pancakes were of the sort that I just plain love.  . . This is honest food, cooked presumably with grease and butter, and is just plain good.  . . The menus look like they are styled a bit after a newspaper, which is new and lovely.  This establishment has something The carnivore has never seen before.  Each table has a device on it that shows an egg with a happy face, or an egg with a sad face.  One is yellow, the other is black, and this means that your server can tell at a glance whether you need her for anything.  Every restaurant should employ a similar device.  . . Amanda was our waitress.  Yes, the Carnivore still uses the words waitress and waiter.  He also will not apologize for this, or stop doing it.  In any case, Any case, Amanda was on point for our whole visit.  All questions were answered promptly, food came out superfast, drinks were topped off without any wait, and she had an infectious smile.  She either loves her job, or should move to Hollywood.  Mrs. Carnivore and I would be delighted to have her wait on is at any establishment.  This level of service is truly rare in today's world.
Good food and good service. Erin was very attentive to us. Will be back the next time we are in town.
Another wonderful breakfast at my favorite LV breakfast spot. Server Alyssa was delightful. Try the chili omelet. My only complaint: they should make a real dairy product available on the table for coffee instead of your having to ask for it. They serve real butter, so why non-dairy creamer? Spock and I consider this "illogical". Still always 5 stars for me and I've been coming here since the 80's.
Food was really good and it comes out quick.  Our server was on top of it and very nice (Lindsey).  The "works" skillet was delicious.
Very good place for breakfast.  Had the taco skillet and it was decent.  The pancakes and banana muffin looked amazing.  Our waitress Samantha was great.
Breakfast was great.  Samantha was awesome. Only ate eggs and chorizo but would have loved to try the carbs.  Pancakes and muffins looked amazing.
I'm a big fan of this place. They have wonderful service and amazing breakfast food. Try the Carnitas with the Salsa Verde and egg. Coffee was HOT and Abundant.
Big tasty servings :) Really quick and kind staff, specifically BreeAnnDa :) Super clean :) Everything I want in a dinning experience.
We live in California and have been here 4-5 times over the course of several years. The reason for my 5 star review is that I'm at a loss to come up with a single negative. Every server has been 100% on top of it. We (myself, wife and two kids) have raved about every entree. The prices are low for strip-area Las Vegas dining. The ambiance is more mid-west USA than Las Vegas but I have no issue with that.. . I'm not one to freely give out 5 star reviews but the Egg and I has earned one.
I order a half order of the bacon onion skillet, It was very good, and the right amount of food for me, orange juice was fresh, although they forgot my order of toast. Overall a good breakfast experience.
Came to vegas for a week and decided to eat off the strip and found this place through yelp.  I was excited to see they served spam, egg and rice.  Came on Monday, June 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by Gia the manager and our waitress, Carole Ann.   They were both very personable.. . We we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by Gia.  Carole Ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  No biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  . . Gia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  She came out with two banana muffins for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  Those muffins were delicious.  Carole Ann came back and took our order.  I ordered the spam and egg over rice.  That came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin I thought that was it.  But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  . . The food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  . . They don't take American Express, not sure if it's just at this location. . . Thank you Carole Ann for great customer service, keep it up and I hope you get to meet Mickey Mouse!!!
Staci, our waitress, was the bomb!  The service here is great. Everyone is so friendly. The food was great. I brought my husband and brother-in-law and they loved it!  Egg and i never fails to impress!
I got the Texan French toast... It was pretty damn good! Coffee could have been a little stronger but not bad. Our server Alyssa did an outstanding job.
I came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. We couldn't get enough!. . Besides the amazing food, there's always great service! I love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. None of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. We flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (Note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...). . We were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: John (I think he's new), Thaynara (sp?), and Erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. They were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. . . So, the FOOD. Amazing. I'm not a breakfast person. Usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and I'm kind of picky, I know. So why did I go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? Because they know how to cook them! Between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! Not that I doubted a place with "egg" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal I had was executed to perfection. Eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. Just right, every time.. . Out of the six things we ordered over our three visits, I got the coffee every time. It was piping hot and delicious, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... They bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. You've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (They had caramel and french vanilla, andI thinkkkk the Irish cream flavor too.) . . They have some awesome works potatoes (I have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. Side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and I did a couple of times. The fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. . . They also have these TO-DIE-FOR banana nut muffins. These muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! Utterly delectable--I definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.. . We've tried the corned beef hash (no canned meat products here!) and the country fried steak as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. The biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and I like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. We also tried the works omelet and Brad's scramble. There is so much on this menu that is tasty! . . I did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. We were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. . . Side note the second: The decor is really cute! It looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with "just hatched" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that delicious banana nut bread to go, too!. . Recap: Everything is delicious, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. Will definitely return and recommend. :D
What an amazing find! We wanted the breakfast buffet at our hotel on the Strip, but found out that the price doubled on the weekend. So on our way out of town to the Grand Canyon, we did a quick Yelp search and found this gem. Being in Vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. It lived up to the hype! . . Definitely ask for the banana nut muffins, they are amazing. As are the potatoes. As are the omelettes...heck, it was ALL great! I ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish. . . Our server, Alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. The manager, Gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.. . After the crazy hustle and bustle and falseness of the Strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. I liked it so much I wanted to buy a T-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that I wanted. Which is probably the only non-five-star thing I can say about this place. We will definitely be back here again the next time we're in town!
My wife and I went for breakfast and were so pleased with our wonderful meal, and great service from Bree!  We are both teachers and we love coming here when we visit Las Vegas during our vacations.  This was our fourth time here, and we've loved it each time!  We shared a delicious spinach, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese fritatta, and their unique Harvest pancakes with blueberries (in the batter, and in a terrific compote topping).  I've ordered these pancakes each time we've gone to the Egg & I because I love the pumpkin-spice and fresh fruit flavor combination.  . . We also love the cute and creative system this restaurant uses to help with customer service (using a smiling egg or frowning egg placard on each table to request service).  As teachers, we are planning to adapt this system to our classrooms for students to request help.
This place is fantastic! The food is great and the servers are incredible. Specifically, our server Karla was bright, cheery and spunky. We will definitely come back the next time were in town!
Amazing!!!  Best service and best food.  Omelets were incredible.  All food came out hot, which never happens at most places.  Erin our server rocked it.
Used to be my favorite place, now i'll never return :(. The service was fine but there was a hair in my skillet and I got food poisining as well. So disappointed as I used to love this spot but I have no tolerance for a dirty restaurant.
This place is a must stop every time I go to Vegas.  I go to Vegas at least once a year, more if I can and anyone who goes with me know that we will go here.  It is still pretty busy in the late morning even if it is off the strip, but if you go early (cause you're still on E. Coast time), or later, it isn't so bad.  . At home we have a place with this name, but it is NOT the same place.  This place is epic good.  My favorites are the Chicken Enchilada Omelet, the Strawberry Stuffed French toast, the banana nut French toast, and the banana nut muffin here is out of this world.  . After a 2008 trip to Hawaii I became obsessed with Hawaiian breakfast and they have both your traditional breakfast of eggs, rice and spam or Portuguese sausage, but they also have loco moco!  If you've never had loco moco it is crazy good.  Rice, steak, and eggs with gravy dumped on top.  Yummy!
Great place to get a hot fresh breakfast! You get a lot of food for your money! I will be coming back here, every time that I visit Las Vegas! "MUST TRY"
This was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!. . I came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in Vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  Both the food and the service were "egg-cellent."  . . Anyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.. . First off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  . . As for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I"ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.. . My other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.. . What I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!. . Lastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas.
It's a decent place for breakfast or brunch. I've had lots ofdifferent things here and none of them are incredible. The potatoes are pretty boring, honestly. The toast is always good. This last time I got the chili with rice instead of pasta. It was ok. I was expecting a small bowl but it was massive and it was covered in cheese. In my opinion, the food here is a 3 but the service is always really good. This last time, Amanda took care of us and didn't miss a beat. Nice job!!
Great bfast after a nite of boozing. The banana nut muffin was spectacular. They have half portions which is great if you are not super hungry or are watching your figure. Service was top notch. Ask to sit in Thaynara's section. She was one of the best servers we have ever had!
Just had our usually great experience here with one HUGE exception - our server, Stacie, was Fabulous!! Helpful - telling us things we never knew - beyond friendly and welcoming.  It truly made our Sunday morning breakfast egg-ceptional!. . And, of you are not aware (we were not), EW (Egg Works) makes terrific hot sauces - we bought the chipotle!  Gotta try them!
Came here for the first time today. Our server Carole Ann was in a word awesome.  My wife got the Cabo burrito and it was huge and quite delicious. The ranch potatoes were heavenly, and superbly seasoned.  I got the plain buttermilk pancakes, and they brought out not one but 3 pancakes the size ofa dinner plate.  I'm a big guy, and was no match for the giant fluffy elliptical yummyness.  All in all a great place to eat.
Food was crazy good and service was exceptional. Our server Amanda was extremely helpful. Her smile seriously made everyone's day.
Nothing like Egg and I to complete a wonderful vegas trip with my friends. I ordered the Western omelet, which was just the sustenance I needed for the drive back. Not only that but I was lucky to have such a great server this time too. Amanda is one of the best servers I've ever seen in a long time. She's friendly, efficient, and extremely courteous :). SHE'S EGGCELENT. IF YOU EVER GET HER BE EGGCITED!
Just finished eating our meal here. Wonderful place with a good location. Always a pleasure to come here. This is my favorite breakfast place by far! Spent $80 on breakfast at the trump and it doesn't compare to this $26 dollar masterpiece! Definitely a place to stop at!
We were originally getting a breakfast buffet at the Wynn and decided it was too pricey. Did a quick yelp search and Egg & I appeared.. . To make the review short: the skillets were huge and nicely made. Prime rib benedict was on point. But the star? The warm muffin. Could just eat that for breakfast and nothing else.. . Service is great too. Our server, Thay, took our group pictures voluntarily and filled our glasses and coffee mugs frequently. Awesome food and service makes for a great experience. . . Casino buffets move aside. Come here for breakfast but leave a spot open for me.. . 5/5 would come again.
My husband and I had a delicious brunch! Our waitress Stacy was kind, helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed. We will be back!
