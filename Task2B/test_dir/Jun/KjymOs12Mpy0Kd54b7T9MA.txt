First rate! Food, drinks and cocktails are amazing!. Jon is easy on the eyes!
I can't really give a full review as we only sat at the bar and had apps. I will say that this was the best beef carpaccio I have ever had!! The service was great and the atmosphere was amazing. You can sit outside and watch the water show at the Bellagio. Definitely a place to check out.
We had a group of 11 of us for dinner for a bachelor party. They seated us at the chef's table that was indoors but had a view of the fountains which was awesome. The food was also fantastic. I don't like olives but I had to try the tapenade that came with the bread to start. It was pretty good. I figured if the restaurant is called olives then you have to try it.. . We had the fig & prosciuotto flat bread to start and it was amazing. As my main course I had the beef tenderloin with asparagus tempura and potato puree. It was very good. I would say the food was not quite as good as Gordon Ramsey's Steak restaurant but the experience was just as good.
We have a lunch for 6 of us. This review should get a 5 star if we would get our patio reservation as requested. . The  bread, octopus/squid appetizer was really good. raw beef salad was really good and My Scallops lunch dish was amazingly good. Services was good, the ambiance was really nice. it would of been a perfect lunch if we could enjoy the Water fountain show at the same time.. Great!!!!
I was a lucky gal this year for my birthday. My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a romantic birthday dinner at any restaurant I wished to try, so without any hesitation, I chose Olives! Their reviews looked immaculate, the view looked amazing, and the food...just look at the food! It was an absolute must for me.. . View 4/5 - the outdoor patio balcony has the ultimate seats, so make sure to try your luck and get their early (before 5pm). It's first come first served on the patio, regardless of reservations. If you come a minute late, you might get stuck with the back seats on the patio, which are not as amazing as the seats right at the edge of the balcony - the view at the edge is unobstructed from those large umbrellas and super up close and personal with the Bellagio fountains. . . Service 4/5 - When we walked up to the host stand, the woman was busy talking to another employee, maybe a manger? But they didn't acknowledge us at all to let us know that they will be a moment. A couple minutes later, when they were done talking, she asked us if we had reservations - I said yes, and gave her my name. I thought that our first impression of their staff and that whole ordeal was disorganized and amateur. . . After we were seated, the service that we received from our waitress Michelle M. was pleasant and gracious. It appeared that she had read our reservation notes, because she even wished me a happy birthday, which was a sweet gesture. Our water was refilled immediately and frequently with the blink of an eye, our bread basket was refilled right when we requested it and also our tapenade and olives were replaced with a fresh batch alongside it. They even doggy bagged the rest of our delicious uneaten bread from our basket and provided us with a new set of the amazing tapenade, to take home.. . At the very end of our meal, our waitress Michelle surprised me with a complimentary plate of 3 cream puffs filled with mousse. The plate was drizzled with chocolate, some berries, with a message in chocolate that said "happy birthday" and also 1 lit candle. It was a  lovely gesture and we appreciated it so much! . . Ambiance 5/5 - I am in love with the intimate lighting and decor inside of the restaurant. The environment was dimly lit, mysterious, stylish and sexy. Definitely special occasion it up at this place! . . Food 5/5 - There was extreme precision and care in the execution and plating of our dishes. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous and vibrant! Both of our dishes were prepared expertly, seasoned to perfection, and incorporated top notch flavor. . . 1. Complimentary bread basket with black olive tapenade, green olive tapenade, and a variety of olives were all incredible. Each and every kind of bread was perfect alone, or with the tapenade. I favored the bread that had some pops of sweetness to it and the Parmesan crisp. . . 2. Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle with king trumpet, shiitake, oyster & crimini mushrooms, english peas, piquillo peppers, parmesan cream, truffle essence, and lemony pea shoots - $34 - The presentation was exquisite. Was it delicious? Absolutely! The dish was flawless. It was luscious and creamy, the pappardelle was cooked al dente, had a hearty abundance of mushrooms, had an overall great mushroom flavor. . . 3. Atlantic Salmon cooked medium well, with creamy beet risotto, sauteed vegetables, curry beurre blanc, roasted fennel & arugula - $36 - This dish was stunning to look at and they did not disappoint in execution. The salmon was cooked perfectly, moist, buttery, and expertly seasoned. The risotto, was slightly sweet, very rich, and paired perfectly with the salmon. The vegetables were all beautiful, cooked with care and added an amazing texture to the dish. I was a fan of this dish! . . Value 4/5 - Honestly, you have to remind yourself that you are paying high strip prices and for also being inside of the Bellagio (with a view like that) you'll be paying top dollar for ambiance. Total was $80.53 for 2 dinner entrees and 1 ($4.50) coke, including tax. The portions were great and they were very generous with the bread refills and the tapenade. Yet, was the mushroom pappardelle worth $34? I don't think so. Maybe if they knocked it a few down to $25...$28 even, then it would be right on the money. There wasn't any protein besides the mushrooms to make that dish that pricey. But we still enjoyed every last bit of it.
Love love love the carpaccio. Never had anything else and don't want to. You will not be disappointed.
After making reservations before we arrived in Vegas, and travelling to other hotels to eat, we happened into Olives (staying at the Bellagio) because we didn't feel like going any further that evening.  We didn't have reservations but found 2 places at the bar.  They serve a full menu at the bar.  Service was fantastic, and food was excellent.  I had Chilean sea bass on mushroom risotto, and I've thought of it since!  My husband had Beef Carpaccio and was just as pleased as I was.
Very solid meal.  Group of four and started with three appetizers, which was the highlight of the meal.  One in our party mentioned Todd English is known for his flatbread and the prosciutto and fig flatbread was awesome, by far the best dish.  Tuna tartare was also perfectly prepared but did comparable at many other restaurants.  We also had the grilled octopus and squid, which seems like the trendy dish right now, it was good but not a huge squid fan.. . As an entree, had lamb shank.  Again it was very solid but did not take the dish to any new levels.  MOst disappointing was green beans tempura.  The tempura and taste was perfect, but they came out of the kitchen at room temperature.  If they are nice and hot, probably would of moved Olives to five stars.. . Overall, an excellent meal but not earth shattering.
We were in town and were looing for something different.  We also wanted Italian.  While were walking around the shops around 5:00/5:15 and were walk-ins.  Had we walked in twenty minutes later, I'm not sure if we would have gotten a seat.  We lucked out on the patio.  It was a bit warm (June), but well worth it.  We had the Fois Gras (A bit over cooked for us) the carpacio, the scallops and the ravioli.  All were fantastic.  Service was great.  The sommelier was slightly unremarkable, but attentive.  We enjoyed it and would go back.
Not bad, not excellent. Nice patio view (not as good as Mon Ami).  Service is good.  Assorted bread basket paired with olive assortment and 2 types of olive spreads.  I asked for the cheese ravioli in a cream sauce. Server suggested that it didn't make for good flavor.  I chose a different pasta dish. . . Beef carpaccio - $20 Large portion good to share 3 or more people. Overall good.  Arugula in the center over something like cornbread but sticky like rice cake (didn't care for that part). . Butternut squash tortellini - the first bite is excellent.  However it is very sweet.  And if you aren't in the mood for it, it is difficult to finish. I could do with less squash and extra sage would be great. . . For tortellini, carpaccio, sea bass, lobster add on, 3 wine. $205 - 2 people with tip. . In all honesty I've had a better tasting more satisfying meal at much more affordable Italian restaurants.  If I really want the view I would choose French at Mon Ami Gabi over this restaurant.  Decent service.  Just nothing spectacular about the food.
I wish I could give this place more stars because I am a huge Todd English fan.  The view from the patio was perfect.  It felt like our own private oasis in the middle of the Vegas strip.   The service was also good.  The food was good, but not GREAT for what you are paying.  We started with the Beef Tartare.  It was really lacking flavor The black truffle emulsion was really good when you could scrape up a little bit of it just for more flavor, but there was very little on the plate.  I had the scallops and they were good.  Cooked perfectly.   My husband had a sirloin steak which was supposed to have a Cajun rub I believe.  He said it really didn't seem like it had much of anything.  In order to enjoy good Todd English cuisine, next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stick to his P.U.B.
A two person $180 bill for Cheesecake Factory experience with bad service?  Brutally bad, which I never expected.  . . (One star because of expectations based on price point and location.). . What do they sell here - heavily?  THE VIEW.  So, what are you paying for here?  THE VIEW.  The food is almost second.  On their website, what do they show you?  THE VIEW.  They show pictures and pictures of the gorgeous views of the fountains.  Um, you're not sitting by the fountains - not even close and they're super snobby about it, like there's some secret way to get it.  It's bait and switch because you literally have no chance of getting that view here at dinner... yet, that's their main selling point (and people who get it stay longer than two hours).  We checked in at 6:45 and they saw it notated that I requested the fountain view.  The hostess (who never smiled once), knowing it was requested in my reservation, callously said it would be another two hours if we wanted that, knowing we were there for a 6:45 dinner and, what, we're just going to walk around for two hours?  Then I would have made a 4:45 reservation, if that was the case.  Instead... what view did we get?  The view of the planter in the back corner, and windows with drapes blocking any kind of view through the umbrellas outside.  We were laughing about how bad of a view it was.  (I'm attaching a picture in this review.)  . . I hate to keep harping on it because, with sitting near a view of ANY kind, this place just looks exactly like the Cheesecake Factory decor.  If I want to a Cheesecake Factory experience, I would have gone there for 1/3 of the price... for the same views and probably better food.  We were also laughing because of how loud it was, as we were by some interior waiter station, clanging cups and broken glasses... the soundtrack for the little bit of the fountain we could kind see.. . Also, I was completely over-dressed with a suit and no tie.  People are in here with shorts and t-shirts.  What!?  There's no jacket policy?  Or, at least a collared shirt?  It's farm town tourist central here.  I expected this to be along the lines of SW Steakhouse and it's not even close, as far as class.   . . Our waitress was awful.  Just an older lady who tried covering up a bad attitude with a teeth-gritting fake smile.  Her lack of knowledge of the menu was astonishing.  We asked about a couple wines and if it was dry or sweet or whatever and she just kinda repeated what we were saying, like, it can't be both.  Any other place, the waiter/waitress would have brought out a couple samples.  Not with her. . . The food.  I ordered a Greek salad and gnocchi, with a Riesling.  The bread and olives were great... I love olives and they have various kinds and spreads.  All great.  The salad was good, again, with olives.  The entree of the gnocchi?  Sloppy mess. Dry, overcooked chicken.  Soupy.  Random mess.  I ate half of it then just gave up.  Brutal.  How do you screw up gnocchi?   . . Kind of sad when the bread and spread far exceeds the entree.  . . The only thing upscale about this place is price point... nothing else justifies it.  It is NOT a "fine" dining experience.  Trust me, if you want a nice night out... go to ANYTHING at the Wynn because you what you "think" you're getting here... is exactly what you get there.  I've been to a number of places there and all were great, especially with the water view.  Just a different vibe, better service, etc.  The ONLY reason to come here would be the view and there's apparently some super secret way to get it... which I do not know of.  . . Obviously I had, what I assume to be, an "outlier" experience, basically, the worst possible experience one could have but I'd never risk giving it another shot... so there won't be a follow-up review.  I've seen enough.
In town for a conference, and after a great lunch here 2years ago, suggested our group try it for dinner.. . The wait was tolerable with our reservation, but the room was over filled and screaming loud. Services was slow due probably to the crowded dinning room, but Joel was attentive and helpful.. . Come hungry, portion sizes were huge!. . Wine list is on an iPad, which was going dead...a little more attention to detail maybe helpful.. . Lunch experience was much better than dinner.
I can't give it one star b/c the food is good.  Monday night-June in Vegas.  My Moms 70th...every time I am in Vegas I eat here-always good.  My moms 1st trip in 30 years-seemed like the logical spot.  No requests for patio ahead of time-well when we arrived 30 minutes ahead of time for our reservation we were told the patio already had a 1hr  wait???? When I asked how that was possible I was told it just was. We got a nice booth.  Happy.  Asked for a Sommelier and it took 30 minutes though Adam was awesome once he got there.. Waiter-Reimer S, was the weak link. Rude, rushed and 1st time ever I had a bill removed from my hand when I finished signing it -literally.. I would have to say a longtime classic has succumbed to the tourist trappings and it is too expensive to be treated like cattle ...sad. And super bummed we chose to spend this special night here.#nodoovers
This restaurant was friggin fantastic. We went here for dinner and I can honestly say it was in the top 5 best meals I've ever had.. . They bring out several kinds of breads with different olive spreads - so good.. . The service was amazing. They really dote over you and make you feel like royalty.. . The food - exquisite. From the steak to the Lobster Mac N Cheese, we were in heaven.. . The VIEW, OH THE VIEW!!!!! We had a seat right by the window overlooking the fountains...it was heaven. So beautiful. And we stayed for hours, weren't rushed out at all.. . Can't wait to go back. Everything was top notch. This restaurant is excellent.
Not the most amazing experience I've had in Las Vegas, but we went for lunch and only ordered the flatbreads. However, my friend ordered the scallops and said they were perfectly cooked, so this review is mainly about the service. The waitress tended to be unattentive
Olives provided a perfect evening.  The food was exceptional and the outdoor seating overlooking the fountains provided the ideal ambience.  Beautiful!
