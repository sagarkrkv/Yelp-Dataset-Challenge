We waited about 10 minutes or so to be seated at around 10am on a Saturday. Very good selection for the breakfast and brunch buffet. Our server was funny but very busy, but nothing too outrageous. $35 each for the buffet, and $12 each for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Very strong pour on the Bloody Mary. We liked everything we had, and a few things were exceptional. Little savory waffle cones with goat cheese and smoked trout, eggs poached in tomato sauce. Apple sausage, carved meats, the list goes on and on. The desserts looked amazing, but I was too stuffed. My wife had a few of the bite-sized desserts and liked them all. Around $125 for a party of two with tax and tip. A little pricey, but we'd go back.
You just can't can't can't can't can't go wrong with this place.  This is definitely an upper level buffet among standard ones.  It may not be the fine dining experience or the Ritz but for buffet food, it's pretty impressive.. . KEEP IN MIND when you look for quality of food at buffets, you are looking at BUFFET FOOD, not minimal menu nice restaurant food.  REMEMBER, the more you focus your business on quantity, you will lose some quality UNLESS you are that awesome.. . So with that in mind, the seasonal tacos they had by the seafood was incredible!  The mixture of crunch and softness and tenderness from the meat makes this a MUST EAT at this buffet. . . The desserts, after sampling endless varieties, I can only remember what they look like.  Be sure to try:. . 1. That orange, half ball, crunchy crust thingy.. 2. The square mango pudding thingy.. 3. The mini dessert cream cones.. 4. Any of the macarons.. . *There is an ultimate WIN to this buffet, but I'm afraid sharing this advice might not be the best idea.  TO FIND IT, find the smaller sign located just to the side of the cashier.  You'll thank me later.
Wow. My wife and I came here. Their pho station was decent. Everything else mediocre. Not a fan. This review is for early 2013. Maybe they improved.
3.5 stars. $40 for dinner per person.. . I've heard so many of my friends raving about this place so I couldn't wait to try it out, but I was kind of disappointed. Maybe the food that was served the night I came in wasn't their best or maybe because I went to Bacchanal the night before & they set the bar too high? . . Wicked Spoon has an array of food ranging from American, Mexican, Italian, & Asian. I thought the food was alright the night I came in for dinner. Some dishes were really good, & then other dishes were just meh. I think the biggest con for me was the fact that some of the food wasn't as warm/hot as they were suppose to be. I do love the portions that they give you though!. . The best part of this buffet was definitely the dessert! THEY HAD THAI TEA GELATO. & it tasted like legit thai tea too, not some artificial ish. They have a wide variety of desserts ranging from cookies, to cream puffs, to chocolate covered strawberries. You know how some foods LOOK good, but then they don't TASTE good? Well their dessert looked good AND tasted good!. . I would probably give this place another try in hopes that maybe the food they served the night I went wasn't the best that they had.
The best buffet experience in Las Vegas, for sure. Everything is in artfully prepared in small dishes and not in huge feeding troughs. Presentations of each station is good and clean. . . Some of the food was a little off, though. All of the Asian-inspired dishes were either incredibly sweet or incredibly salty (sushi included). The pizza might have tasted good but certainly didn't look edible in the least. The desserts are the highlight. Gelato is P.E.R.F.E.C.T.  Literally, their maker is the best in Vegas. . . The service is also the nicest and most attentive buffet servers and cashiers ever! Everyone was super friendly and as soon as our plates were done they were cleared right away.
Went here for brunch on a Tuesday. Wonderful experience. Diverse, foodie-cultured menu. . . Reminded me of dishes you'd see on The Food Network. Also has a nice array of traditional breakfast items, including eggs benedict, Chinese pork belly, and mac & cheese. . . While most of the other buffets in Vegas tend to be traditional and either excessive or glamorous, Wicked Spoon strikes a decadent balance between old world favorites and new world innovations. . . Cosmopolitan's art house personality definitely influences the menu and ambiance of Wicked Spoon. Can't wait to try this place for dinner.
After my poor review and not liking it the first time, we went back again because friends in our group reaaaally wanted to try it and we were outnumbered. This is more like 3.5stars.. . It was better this time as we really liked the salmon dish and tried the mac and cheese bar where you can customize w/diff. toppings. Also tried the cold cuts & cheeses, tapenade etc.. The food was similar as last but still not outstanding. The crab was already cracked which was great, but they were a bit dry. Do not even try the sushi... the rice was soooo hard and dry (and it wasn't fish, mostly tempura and veggie, cali roll) Asian food was not good almost stale, and the kung pao cauliflower was just ok. . The sides were different, for example instead of creamed spinach, it was creamed leaks. They didn't have the shortribs in the pot which was a bummer. Tried the taco and it was dry. If you don't eat red meat or want seafood, forget about it. . . We had a couple that only eat fish and chicken, and didn't have many choices. (they ate kung pao cauliflower) They had different salads some with tuna and others with boiled eggs. They had a lot of carbs like white rice, brown rice, fried rice, paella, risotto, bread etc. . . I got my moneys worth in desserts (macraons, cakes, choco strawberries and gelato!) Earlier that day I went to Jean Philip Patisserie and choco strawberries were $5+ each and similar pricing w/gelato so you get a great deal here if you stuff your face with desserts and they taste similar. No wait!
We had dinner here last Friday night (5/30). Anticipating a long line, we decided to hit it early -- around 6:00 -- but surprise to find no line so our party of 5 got seated right away. Attendance seemed a bit light for all the hype but that was fine with us. Things did pick up quickly before we left but didn't notice a line yet. The restaurant has a large seating area and they spread a lot of guest out so it doesn't feel crowded. . . Like others have mentioned, the food is pretty solid overall but some dishes stood out while others I thought were just OK. Most dishes are individually prepared in just the right portions and nicely presented. If you want more, just get more. This allowed us to try a lot of dishes and decide which dishes to try again. . . For me, the duck wings, kale salad, pork belly, calamari, carnitas, octopus salad and lamb were some of my favorites.. . Service was good. Our waiter check on us often to clear plates and refill our drinks.. . Come hungry and don't forget to leave room for dessert. I'll be coming back on our next trip to LV.
As a vegetarian, it was completely worth the price! Angry mac and cheese and chocolate covered strawberries were AMAZING. Wonderful attentive service. We went for lunch and the line took about 20 minutes, not bad at all!
Our trip to the Wicked Spoon was our best dining experience during five days in Vegas. Once you get past the sticker shock, brunch at Wicked Spoon will treat you to many great dishes. I won't get into individual foods, because there's too much to highlight, but it's almost worth it for dessert alone. Wicked Spoon has something for everyone, like my youngest son who is a very picky eater.
This is the best brunch experience of a lifetime of brunching.. . As someone with quite a lot of experience in eating nice brunches, this easily took the #1 spot for the best brunch I've ever had. I arrived at the Wicked Spoon on a Friday around 11 am with my significant other. The restaurant is really big with lots of seating, and the entrance was very efficient and swift with getting the customers seated. The inside is decorated tastefully with a casual, modern look. We were happy to have plenty of space where we were seated. . . We also paid for the unlimited mimosas, which with the brunch, was really an incredible value considering the level of quality of food that you are getting here.. . The variety of items was spectacular, and so many of the options were truly original creations, especially for brunch. They offered things such as a delicious risotto, or a creamy tomato gnocchi, and they were each served at the buffet in these adorable mini saucepans. All of the different egg dishes at the buffet were phenomenal. My significant other said that the French toast was the best he had ever eaten, and from its appearance, I found that easy to believe. I won't forget to mention that the bacon was delicious and cooked to perfection. Although I did not try any of the desserts, the dessert buffet was beautiful.. . I was quite surprised that this restaurant received only a solid 4 star rating. This was, at minimum, a 4.5 star restaurant, although I stand firmly behind rating it at 5 stars. Your table received a bottle pitcher of water so that you are never sitting at your table parched and dying of thirst. The waitress was on quick on her feet, and was even thoughtful enough to bring my significant other two glasses of champagne at a time. You are making a mistake if youcome to Vegas and you do not eat here for brunch!
Fine for a buffet, I guess.  Some of the food was pretty tasty and some of it was obviously pre packaged.  Go early because you will beat the lines, but also because it'll give you more time to digest so you can drink through the night. I really looked 6 mos pregnant after I left.
Great food selection but even better service. LISA hands down best server ive ever had. Very hospitable she turned a regular buffet experience into a really great time. Lox pizza is also reallly good.
United airlines gave out buy one get one free coupons on the flight over so we got an amazing deal here.  We came around 1pm for brunch and found out that they start serving the crab legs at 3pm... we literally stayed until around 4pm.  Since we got a good deal we didn't feel as pressured to only eat the expensive stuff and we discovered the congee was amazing.
Great times at the spoon after you've spent a night cheering on guns n roses, visiting the after party, driving by crazy horse, and attempting to garner food at spearmint  (they are not a wild game rotisserie and apparently there is no edible cuisine there). We took on the full. Onslaught of the Spoon, and the 36 scoop gelato sampler.
We went for dinner, the price was 44$ a person, but this is weekend price. . . . The food was really good, there just wasn't a lot of selection. The quality of the food was very good, and tasted fresh. . . The service was on par, they never let me stack the dishes. Someone always came by and took our plates without interruption.. . Overall good buffet, I would visit again
My friends and I (group of 6) went to Wicked Spoon for brunch on a Friday. The cost was $29 per person. Alcohol isn't included (made the mistake and ordered a Bellini at $15 a pop). There wasn't a wait at all and we were seated immediately. . . This buffet was amazing. The presentation was stunning. The taste was incredible. . I ate and ate and ate. There wasn't one person at my table that didn't enjoy their meal. There was so many different items it was difficult to pick what to eat. I tried to sample everything but that was impossible. The different types of food items went on and on. . . The only reason I give it a 5 star rating is because I tried another brunch buffet at Caesars Palace Bacchanal and it was horrible! So I had something to compare it to.    . . Wicked Spoon was an amazing deal. The good was insatiable. . . Seriously if you want to enjoy a good buffet don't go anywhere else but the Wicked Spoon. You won't regret it.
Went here for dinner Saturday night. $52 per person, group of 9.. . Food is mediocre for sure. Definitely subpar..  - Ramen was extremely salty. Made to order, but your selection of soup broth is limited to just tonkatsu..  - 2 pc deep fried chicken wing/drumstick in a metal basket. Avoid this flavorless chicken. Definitely wins the crappy appetizer award..  - Chinese box of pork fried rice - Decent, but nothing to rave about .  - Boiled sauteed shrimp - Was expecting hot and spicy, but got cold and lacking flavor..  - Snow crab legs - Maybe it was due to the timing of the year, but the snow crab legs was disappointing compared to Wynn/Rio/Aladdin's buffet. The size of the snow crab legs were small.. . What tasted good. Miso Soup - Tough to screw this up, but it did taste good. Gelato - Lemon and Strawberry. . Service - GREAT! . . Personally, I wouldn't recommend this spot. Too much hype on yelp. Maybe because it's one of the newer, trendier buffets.
had brunch here about a week ago - food is definitely intricate and you can tell the ingredients are fresh.  salad bar was amazing... savory food was so-so; some of the portioned out food, although very eye appealing, had been sitting there for quite some time, under the heat lamps too long... the 'asian' side of the buffet was pretty dismal - yes, things came in little chinese take-out boxes, but the taste did not blow your mind... nothing i ate was so good, that i wanted to go back again.... the dessert bar and gelato bar were the highlights of the buffet, lots to choose from and all very delicate and easy for tasting.. loved the gelato/ice cream bar..... . overall, for the price $27 weekday lunch, compared to studio b buffet at the m resort ($17, and with MUCH MORE selection including alcohol) - i would rather go for the later, especially if you're driving in and out of Vegas and happened to be passing by M resort..... . but YES, i would go to this buffet again if i was around the cosmo area!
One of the best buffets that I actually enjoy! Cashier was hilarious and easy going as well as our waitress. The buffet had so many food to choose from. It wasn't like usual food at regular buffets. I really like the decorations in the buffet and how they make the food look so good & taste so good. The dessert had so many varieties! There are diff flavors ice cream like thai tea, nutella, & more! The buffet is located on the west side tower. It is $35 a person. . . It was my first time here and next time, I would come back!
This buffet was perfect! I loved how the portions are mostly individually plated already and the presentation is awesome. The risotto is one of my favorites and the gelato station is delicious! You will not be disappointed. They have everything from breakfast to sushi to pasta and pizza. Very nice spread for 30$ a person. I would suggest upgrading to the mimosa and Bloody Mary option for just 10$. It's definitely worth it. Loved this place!
Wicked spoon Oh how you make me so happy... This buffet is not like any other typical buffet... single servings prepared for you,  the dessert bar is huge,  an island on its own. .. Oh and thai tea ice cream YES! Oh the shrimp cocktail!!! Oh the shrimp wheat ball!!! I can go on and on but I won't... You have to come and check it out for yourself... And Maryann Thank you for such great service A++ See you again next time wicked spoon
Was looking forward to this specific buffet for our Vegas vacation. Definitely not disappointed!!! . Super friendly staff, their prime rib was amazing, elegant atmosphere, and their desserts was to die for (personal favorite were the gelato and the macaroons).. Definitely coming back for our future trips to Las Vegas.
WOW! . I heard alot about Vegas's buffets but it was mind-blowing! . Sooo cheap for its quality! . Must Must try. . . The best dishes were: . foie gras, . made-to-order pasta (you can even add Gruyere cheese) . bone marrow, . meat, . thai-tea flavored icecream (how come I can't find this elsewhere? Definitely going to start looking in NYC, where I live). . Anyway this place made my vegas trip 100000000000x better. . Will come back!
It's over priced! Everything is small plates. We were staying mid week and we had a 30 minute wait to eat.
Went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Friday night. Costed us about $80+ with tip of course. Customer service was great! Very friendly staff and we were lucky to have a great server, Tony. . . The food here was so-so flavor wise.  The food was fresh since we arrived right when they opened.  The red meats (steak, roast beef, etc) served were cooked perfectly (medium-rare to medium) but bland for my taste.  I felt the variety for entrees were a bit small.  The desserts on the other hand were delicious!  I think I will go back to try the food during brunch time and see if it's better than dinner.
We went for dinner on a weeknight. Everything I ate was outstanding! The service was also great as my drink never was empty with the attentive waitress. My husband and I were not disappointed and loved the Wicked Spoon. Our only reservation about such a pricey buffet is the selection. We would have expected more vegetable options, and there was little to no fruit available during our dining experience. Luckily, we were not there to be super healthy and filled up on many other items including the macaroni bar and several scoops of gelato. I would definitely recommend this Vegas buffet, and I feel like our money was worth the overall experience.
Aside from me trying to actively avoid buffets, I think it can be a little tricky to give a fair assessment and review of a buffet. I think anytime you have a place that mass produces food at AYCE rates, and especially located by so much foot traffic like the Cosmo/The Strip, you often times have to compromise the quality going down.. . That said I think Wicked Spoon overcomes that. Across the board the food is good, not spectacular, but definitely fulfilling. My favorites are the mac&cheese you can customize as well as the Wicked Mashed Potatoes. But don't follow my advice because you probably don't want to load up on all those carbs with everything else the buffet has to offer! In addition to the food being good, the presentation on the food is particularly stellar, for what thats worth. The serving sizes of each meal item and the way it is delicately placed on plates is so detail-oriented.. . Try to leave some room for the dessert because they are definitely spot on and good for buffet-quality.. . In terms of prices, pay attention to when lunch rates and dinner rates are. During the weekend, dinner rates start at 3 pm and will cost about $41 per person. For kids it comes to $18.
Hello, my fellow Yelpers.. . I rushed over to this place tonight and found myself having only an hour left to eat.. . So, first off.. Let me say that the Crab Legs here are unflavored, but cut and ready to eat. The prime rib and bone marrow here is delicious. . . Beware, this buffet only serves crab legs for seafood and has nothing else, except mussels. . . The best part of this buffet is definitely the dessert section. Granted, if you have a sweet tooth.. This is definitely a place you will enjoy. The chocolate covered strawberries were another delight, except it's only milk chocolate. The macaroons were chocolate banana and were just right.. . This place serves so much rice. Really, risotto, paella, or fried rice.. You name it.. Dinner was $38. Not worth it.. Go to M Buffet for $23.99 instead!
Why was i so stupid that I took my husband here when both of us were sort of.. wasted.... I mean. Drunk.. . I feel like we both didn't get our money's worth.. So.. Lesson Learned. Do not Go to Wicked Spoon and pay about $100 including tip (for two people) when you are Drunk out of your mind.. . From what i recall.... . I did enjoy the following:. . *Prime Rib: Really juicy and tasty... Loved the tenderness and the flavor.. great au jus as well...... . *BACON: it's not the strips okay? They have the actual bacon slab. ---this cured my drunkness right away. Amazing amazing. I was so happy I could cry.. . *Bone Marrow: talk about Cholesterol whatever. This was freaking good.. . *Fried Chicken: AAAAAH MAAAZING.. and they come in cute little silver baskets.. . and oh sh*t. that's all i could remember. I didn't even get any french macaron or anything for dessert.. . But i shall be back. with a better appetite and a not drunk self.
I've been here twice and it's definitely on my favorite buffet list along side Caesar's Bacchanal  and the buffet at the M casino. It's definitely a buffet with more sophisticated options. My favorites are the bone marrow, mushroom risotto w/ truffle oil & braised beef w/ cavetelli pasta! Everything I've tried has been really flavorful and not lacking in seasoning. They also offer items like fried chicken, paella, tacos, crab legs, prime rib, lamb, Chinese food in little take out boxes, and an amazing selection of gelatos/desserts. Minus one star because their desserts weren't as flavorful as their food and it's little pricey on the weekend pushing $50 a person.. . Hours: . Open 7 days. Daily Brunch: Mon-Fri 8:00am to 2:00pm. Weekend Brunch: Sat-Sun 8:00am to 3:00pm . Weekday Dinner: Mon-Thur 5:00pm to 9:00pm. Friday Dinner: 5:00pm to 10:00pm. Saturday Dinner: 3:00pm to 10:00pm. Sunday Dinner: 3:00pm to 9:00pm. . And their pricing ranges depending on the time/day, around $30-55 per person but I believe well worth it!
Wicked spoon is very pretty inside and the selection for the buffet is very big! They have seafood, lamb shank, steak, Asian food, Italian, French, u name it they probably have it. For a buffet a lot things tasted pretty good. Of course not everything was cooked perfectly. It is a buffet after all. My favorite is the shepherd's pie. It was amazing. Their steak is pretty plain. Their veggie selection is not very big, I won't recommend this place for vegetarians. Their desert section is AMAZING!!! It's so big! Their gelato was amazing!!! I just kept on going back for it. . . I think wicked spoon is the best buffet I've been to in Vegas. It's pretty pricey, almost 45 per person for dinner including tax. I would come back again!
I came here an hour before they closed and did not feel rushed at all. Overall they have some good choices but for the price bacchanal is a far better choice. . . I loved the Bone Marrow, Waldorf Salad, Panna Cotta, & Watermelon. It was disappointing that they didn't have king crab legs..just snow crab. Everything else served was nothing to rave about. . . They have a good variety of desserts and I definitely recommend trying the Gelato. They have a large variety with some unique flavors. When I went there was a line to get the gelato. Some of the flavors are really good (Chai Tea, Nutella) but others taste off (Mint Chip). The macarons were stale...the filling was hard. . While dining there was a table nearby that was called to the managers attention. The server paid extra attention to them, often flirting with the group of guys and basically neglected our table. Every single time she came to pick up our plates we had already stacked them for her because she had taken so long that we'd gone multiple rounds around the buffet. . . Be aware that there are better buffets on the strip and think about whether or not you want to spend your money here.
I don't know what all the hype is about but my husband and I just ate here and he got the worst stomach ache ever... and I did not even finish the first plate... It's like any other buffet (watered down, dry, tasteless food ... ) and highly overpriced!! Not worth it and I definitely will not recommend or come back to this place ... Yuck!!!
My favorite buffet! I love the tapas sized portions, it made it super easy to try a little bit of everything here! . Wicked Spoon of course had the usual staples of a Las Vegas Buffet like prime rib, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, pizzas, and a salad bar. There are just a few things about this place that made this my favorite buffet on the strip: macaroni & cheese bar, bone marrow, and dessert station. Wicked Spoon has a section where a cook makes fresh macaroni & cheese just the way you like it with whatever topping you choose, I had bacon, crab meat, mushrooms and truffle oil-so delicious! At their meat station they not only have different types of roasts, but also cooked to perfection bone marrow. If you haven't eaten bone marrow you are missing out. To top off your meal, if you still have room, they have an ice cream bar at the dessert station. There is a chef that scoops your choice of frozen dessert just got you.
The food is good and the atmosphere is nice but it's a bit pricey for the amount of selections they have.
This was VERY ok imho.. Interesting concept ... little dishes of gourmet food ... but it really wasn't amazing or had me leaving saying wow by any means.. Plus my fiance got double charged for this place and is dealing with his bank to get it reversed ... thanks wicked spoon.
Certainly the best buffet I've ever had, and probably the second best meal I had during my entire Vegas trip.. . We visited Wicked Spoon for brunch, and for a pretty decent price (I believe it was in the $35 area), you had tons of options at your disposal from classic breakfast fare to more "interesting" options. How many other places can you get french toast and pancakes with green pea pasta carbonara and goat cheese panna cotta? . . Every dish I had was excellent, but there were a few standouts in definite need of mentioning: don't miss the angry mac & cheese, or any of the pasta dishes for that matter. Double up on the ratatouille, go nuts with the shockingly good sushi, and save room for the full gelato bar with mini-sized scoops to ensure you can run through their stellar selection of desserts. The high rating is well deserved.
Sorry, I honestly tried so hard to love this buffet. It's beautiful, the decor is nice. The staff is great....well except for the two chefs who decides to have a rather heated exchange by the Asian station (please, go fight in the kitchen). But there was very little to like when it came to the main entrees. First, the positives. The cold station/salad bar was great!! Desserts 100% saved the meal. Otherwise, the bone marrow was a huge failure. Season it, serve it with charred crostini and it needed a little something acidic to fight the richness. Homemade bacon, again...season it. One bite just tasted like pure salt. And the next bite tasted like ham. Cure it, smoke it, etc. Crab legs....snow crab? No thanks, not for $47 per person before tax. And it doesn't matter if you serve things in tiny portions...if it still just sits around under a heat lamp, it's still not attractive and doesn't make me want to try it. My advice...throw in the extra $11 and go eat at Bacchanal.
Food is okay for the price, we figured to give it a try with all the great reviews and recommendations. Do not come in for brunch because the selection is rather limited. We'll probably try the dinner selection eventually and find out if this place is worth coming back to.
If you want fresh and delicious make sure to stop by this buffet. There will be foods you've never tried and foods you must try. We went twice while in Vegas because it was that good.
I had very high expectations for this buffet but all in all not the best I've been to. We waited in line for an hour only to find out we had 30 minutes to eat before they started putting the food away. They really should tell people a wait time or have a sign stating when food is no longer served at the beginning of the line. The food was good but not excellent. Service was mediocre due to the fact that our used dishes were still on the table when we had come back with new food. I'm usually not that picky but if I am paying 40 dollars a person I expect the very best. . . Overall I would just go to the aria for their buffet... much better.
The service was attentive, the decor was very beautiful... but the food itself was just ok at best. I really truly wanted to love this place. I even went back again and again to find something redeeming. However, at the end, there was more wrong than was right. I had very high expectations for this buffet and I feel let down. I will not be coming back.. However, the desserts were awesome and were absolutely the star of the buffet... my hats off to the Pastry Chef.
Their desserts are phenomenal. I wasn't too impressed with much else. The bone marrow really is a heart attack. I don't enjoy chunks of fat, I think I'll stick to bacon. For the price, it really is just fair. I paid roughly $58 for dinner. Chow down on those crab legs, they were the best things there!
Not impressed at all. Thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay. I was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us. The waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes, the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity. I mean doesn't she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us? It made no sense and she wouldn't or couldn't explain the theory behind it. After paying this " mandatory gratuity" we couldn't enjoy our dinner and decide to leave. I was really looking forward to the Wicked Spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had, it just didn't happen.
I literally cannot say enough about this effing buffet!!! OMG! My husband and I stopped in after reading the good reviews for brunch one day of our Vegas honeymoon. It was SO worth the hike from our hotel to get there! The service was the best we received from even the priciest of restaurants we visited during our vacation. Right from the start we got some great advice and instruction from the cashier on how to go about enjoying the buffet. Our server greeted us right away and brought us some amazing Bloody Mary's (and even made sure we had to-go cups before we left!). The buffet was unlike any we have ever tried. All of the food was gourmet and portioned perfectly in awesome little serving vessels. It had all the usual excess of any Vegas buffet, but everything was amped up to a whole new level of quality. I'm Celiac and have to eat gluten free and I found so many great options with ease (including gluten free cupcakes- what?!?!) I ate my own weight in mashed potatoes, indulged in some outstanding spicy poached eggs, had 2 servings of the most delicious kale salad in existence and left feeling so insanely full (but not grossly so like you do from so many other buffets). Best. Buffet. Ever. Best restaurant ever! An absolute must for any Vegas trip!
Definitely one of the top 3 buffets in Vegas! Big selection of food and desserts, and good quality. The meats were top notch...especially the house made bacon(cut to order) and the bone marrow....winners! The seafood selection wasn't too impressive and not much to choose from. The Asian entrees was pretty much the downfall of the buffet. But overall,  very impressive buffet!
I would want to give this place a 4 star for creativity in a way i feel is more sanitary but I base my review on flavors, selections, quality. Their selections (most) are in tiny pots and plates (individual servings) instead of the traditional scooping method. Another reason is the quality of the foods are fresh and in the ingredients they use. . . In the salad section and the carving station, the food is great! They serve giant bone marrows that many other buffets do not serve. Well I don't eat it as I got to watch my cholesterol intake but heard is delicious and I can tell as how many of those things I see people grab! When it comes to the pasta and other pot/small plate sections, I do have to say that the food is quite greasy and very salty. Some items were delicious but not too well rounded as I would expect for a classy buffet like this and for the price you pay. With the line that's also over an hour long at times, not too worth it. (minus 1-star).. . The place is quite huge and all the food items are spread out. So selection wise, not too many choices at all. So again for the price you pay, not too happy. (minus-1 star) Also, I don't think they make all the desserts themselves which kind of sucks but they are still delicious!  . . I will admit since I do like some of the selection they offer that no others have, I may come back again. But rarely as again, because its expensive, the line is crazy and for being non consistent in flavors (salty/greasy) this would definitely be a rare or craving occasion.
Seriously the best buffet out there. One thing that's really important to me is that everything is clean. The servers and chefs make sure everything is nice and tidy. The wait staff is great and are always checking in, making sure you have everything you need. . . The food is FANTASTIC! The lamb, salmon, bone marrow, and desserts were phenomenal. Also, every salad I tried was great. Everything tasted extremely fresh and was prepared into little portions so you could try little bits of everything. The watermelon w/ siracha  sauce was a huge hit at our table. The gelato bar is great with some really unique flavors. There honestly wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like (and I tried A LOT of stuff)! . . If you're going to the dinner buffet (the one we went to), I would highly recommend getting there right when it opens or sometime between 5-6, otherwise you might be waiting in a massive line, and we went on a weeknight. Again, really impressed with how clean it was and how swiftly everything moved, even when it got crowded. . . The price was about $40 a person, but it was totally worth it. Will definitely come back for the brunch buffet!!
Four $41 on a Friday night and half-price for the kids it is a little bit overpriced for the quality. I wouldn't say it is such a bad quality however compared to what I did before.  I really like the wings in it's own fryer basket. The chinese box for rice is great too for little kids.. Not many were all HIT items, you gotta pick and choose but overall for 3 or 4 Hit items, the price is way out of the ball park.   The gelato is great, btw, many selections and of course as many times as you want.  I prolly would not choose this again, but if others were so crowded, i might come back. It's more like a B-. That's a passing grade but not really all thaaaat.
No good!!!!!! $35 per person and the food is just not so good and wine is not included.  I recommend M buffet at M resort ,much better for the quality, variety and  price. The M resort buffet includes wine, latte and much better variety and quality!!!!! You wont be disappointed at the M buffet!
Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan is doing buffet right.  Food is made in small batches or individual servings which keeps everything fresh and reassures you that you're not sharing a dish with the last 100 people who came before.  There is a variety of American and International fare, food that is familiar and new and whimsically presented.. . The interior is modern, clean, and comfortable.  Our server was friendly and pointed out her favorite dishes that she didn't want us to miss.. . Put on your stretchy pants and head on down.  Try coming at off-peak times like in between breakfast and lunch or an early dinner to avoid having to wait and look for possible discounts when signing up for an Identity Club Card or coupon books to save.
As far as buffet goes, 4 stars. Tons of variety. You will eat so much you'll start to feel uncomfortable. Desserts were awesome, especially the gelato. My server was friendly and attentive. The line/wait wasn't too bad, but I went on a weekday.. . Will probably try other buffets before thinking of returning. Unfortunately, nothing really stood out as cravable. For the price paid, you can get at least a couple excellent meals off strip.
Some of the worst service I have had in any Vegas restaurant. . . The lady in the front seem to be angry that more people were coming in at 8:45. When speaking to us, she was very rude and had much of an attitude.. . The guy serving the desserts was eating his crab legs behind the counter and when I asked for a scoop of ice cream. He looked at me and said "Sorry we can't serve anymore (This was at 9:10 PM, when they do last-calls at 9:15 PM). I guess he was hungry.... . Our server was amazing though as she was very prompt with our drink refills
Reallyyy enjoyed this place! Food taste so much better than the buffet in caecars palace and price was more affordable. Mac n cheese bar is awesome since you get to decide what goes in your mac n cheese. I just wished that they had a bigger options with the desserts.. . Come early as possible before lunch and dinner rush. Line gets super long.
This is more like 3 or 3.5 stars. I am giving an extra 0.5 starts because of the ambiance, decor, and the presentation of the food.. . When you walk into the buffet it looks stunning and modern. Even the glasses for your water are cute glass cups. We went on a weekend so the lunch price was slightly cheaper at $36.75. I believe that the lunch price ends at 3pm and the dinner price starts at 3:30pm. If you come make it before 3 you can get the lunch price, but stay long enough to 3:30 to get some of the dinner selection!. . The food was presented in a cute manner in a nice petite, delicate manner. Unfortunately the food did not taste as wonderful as it looked. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the food, especially after hearing so many great reviews about this place. Most of the food was edible, it was not spectacular like how some of the past reviews made it out to be. Additionally, the buffet is not too big so there was a limited selection. We waited for the dinner, but when it became 3:30 there was not a huge difference between the lunch and dinner. I am not sure if it was because we went on a weekday or this is how it normally is even on the weekends. My group and I were all excited for crab at dinner, but when we got it it was not even boiled, but cold and way too salty. I must say the risotto was not too bad, probably the best meal, but it would have been even better if it was kept warmer. . . We all though that dessert would save the day after looking at the gorgeous pictures on Yelp and reading the reviews, but once again we found ourselves dissatisfied. At least our server was nice enough to personally deliver macarons to us after we asked her if there were any that day. There was nothing special about the desserts. The macarons were a bit too hard and it may have been  was not a huge fan of flavors as well. I would have liked more variety but they only offered two flavors, one being orange. The highlight was most likely the ice cream. . . I probably won't come back since the food was definitely not worth the price.
This is my second visit to wicked spoons. I have been here over a year ago and I thought the food was delicious and presentation was nice. I was so excited to go back and was VERY DISAPPOINTED in both the food quality, selection and SERVICE!! I was there for dinner, I paid at 6pm and had to wait in a line to be seated. The wait wasn't bad, was bout 20 minutes. We were seated and I went to see what was good. The only thing that appear good was the crab legs. I got about 5 pieces, the shrimp cocktail looked alittle leftover from lunch. There was no cut fruit, except banana and apple. The Asian food items were combine about 10 items. I tried couple of the items and walked around again and didn't see anything appealing and what I tasted wasn't good. I told my server I wasn't happy with the food and he called the manager. The manager said he can ask the Chef to make something. I honestly lost my appetite after 2 bits of bad food and I only had 30 minutes left cause I only had some time till my flight. . I told the manager I only had 5 crab legs, 2 bits of some dish. He was quite rude saying I was here for a hour and could not refund my money, I was technically in the dining area for 40 minutes but I didn't barely ate anything. I didn't feel I was offered good service. I said I'm not happy the food and will be leaving. He just said okay because he DOES NOT care. I never complain in restaurants unless it's something BIG!! Sad to say, Cosmo does not care bout their customers...at least that is how they made me feel. . . Advice: if you don't like something, make sure you complain within 15 minutes. Don't me like me to think to wait around for the server. . . So disappointed!!! I left crying because the manager took 2 minutes to deal with me and  didn't care and made it KNOWN they do NOT care!! So go to the older hotels for a good buffet.
After not eating breakfast and lunch, a four-hour drive, and a trek across multiple hotels to get to the buffet, we worked up an appetite and couldn't wait to eat! There was a small line outside the cash register where you pay first then dine. We opted out of the unlimited drink option which was only $10 more because we were ready to eat until we each had a food baby. Our buffet meal came out to be around $41 dollars per person before tip. This also includes unlimited fruit drinks and soda!. . I was very impressed with the amount of variety of foods they had! It definitely blows any local buffet out of the water, but it is to be expected if you're paying over $40 for a meal! Unfortunately, the food was not mind-blowing. Some dishes were good and some were mediocre. I would skip the Chinese foods they have in the take out boxes completely. The best part about this buffet and probably all the other Las Vegas buffets are their desserts. There are many choices of ice cream, cakes, and pastries to choose from. Overall, the service was decent, but I think buffets usually don't provide much incentives for outstanding performance.
Whenever I hear of these somewhat crazy priced and famous Las Vegas buffets, I always come in with high expectations. Why not right? It's Vegas. And considering how hard money is to come by these days, you've got to be smarter about where and how you spend it. Wicked spoon was not an exception, and for me.... . It lived up to the hype.. . I went in for brunch, and after seeing all the amazing photos posted by my fellow yelpers, I was excited.  Everything was presented well.  The plates/containers utilized to display the individual entrees were so cute. I absolutely LOVED their pork belly! Although we unfortunately came towards the tail end of their brunch, so I was only able to get whatever was left. I think they refilled it one other time, but it was totally gone the next time I arrived :(. Their French toast was also notable.  Next time I brunch there, bottomless mimosas will be a priority. I'd also like to experience what dinner is like here as well.  . . It was definitely memorable, and I very much look forward to my next visit!
Wicked spoon was a bit of a let down. You pay Wynn prices but all you end up with Is mediocre food in small serving sizes. It's more of a gimmick then anything. . . Do yourself a favor, go wait in line at the Bellagio, or pay the price for the Wynn.
This is by far the best hotel brunch buffet I've ever had and my wife agrees! So many item to choose from, crazy. Stay away if you're trying to stay lean for the pool area :-) ... If you're staying at the cosmopolitan make sure you get breakfast included since you don't wanna miss out! Open for brunch between 8am-2pm which makes it perfect for everybody staying in Vegas.
First time here was with a group of 10 people. They had special promo 3 years ago and 8 of us got free pass for the buffet!!! I love their huge shrimp and huge chocolate strawberry ^^ I brought my mom here once and she is in loved with their lamb chop! ^^
Maybe because Bachannal buffet is so above and beyond, having high hope for the almost equally praised Wicked Spoon, I am fairly disappointed.. . To compare with Bachannal, the pluses are. - some deserts are slightly better.  Macarons were not available at Bachannal. - the BBQ and grilled meat, quality and selections are better than Bacchanal.  . - no one rubbing elbows with you in competition for crab legs . - more vegetarian dish selections. . The minuses and misunderstandings. - seafood selections are much better at Bachannal.  They got raw oysters, generous selections of bigger sized peeled shrimps.  While Wicked Spoon has seared salmon, Bachannal has seared sea bass.  Is it not at least a step up or what?. - I came to Wicked Spoon because I thought they serve smaller portions on all the food and in exchange I had high hope for quality.This is where my most disappointment is.  In fact, majority of the food is still served just like any other buffets and not much better quality.. - the desert selections and quality is another disappointment.  They actually reminds me of buffet on a mediocre Carnival cruise buffet, the arrangements are messy. (except the Macarons.). What I thought is so funny are the raspberry chocolate mousse, they put printed raspberries on top the mousse.  Come on!
The food option was great for the most part. Leg of lamb/bone marrow was good and so were the ice creams. . . Unfortunately, I will give it 2 stars because as i was walking around, there were dirty plates on the "clean" plate stack on two separate areas of the buffet floor, And im not talking about dirty plates with smudges. These plates had full on touched left overs on them. Another reason why it's getting 2 stars? My chocolate covered strawberry had hair twirled around the chocolate. I thought my hair had fallen on my plate at first, until i picked it off and the hair literally un-twirled itself around the berry..... . For a highly rated buffet location, i wouldve expected sanitary practices.
Wicked Spoon wicked good. . One of the finest buffet in Vegas. They were one of the first buffet to implement small portions on small serving plates.  It makes the buffet experience more sanitary and less wasteful.. Food quality is great. They change certain parts of the menu often so it doesn't get boring.. I love their ice cream selection.
2.5/5, +.5 for service. . Not so wicked anymore unfortunately.. . Wicked Spoon was the talk of town the first time I was in Las Vegas in 2011, along with the Bellagio and Wynn buffets. However, in my most recent visit, Wicked Spoon has definitely slipped in quality, and with Bacchanal opening the focus is easily on them now.. . However, Wicked Spoon still has great variety for what it offers. I especially like the fact they have the small pots for many of their foods, so it encourages less waste (although people like my dad would grab 10 pots!). Their prime rib and dessert options are definitely on the plentiful side, so I guess if you're more into meat and not into seafood Wicked Spoon would still fit your appetite quite well.. . The price, however, is not worth it especially comparing to Bacchanal. I paid the same price for both, but easily had a better buffet experience a few blocks north. I didn't manage to go back to Wynn this time around, but if their buffet is still good this place will be taken off my buffet to-do list.. . Service was great though. The waiter constantly approached us to refill our drinks, asked if we wanted more, and greeted and said goodbye to us.
This buffet is amazing. I've been here twice now. The moment I walked in, the plethora of options was too amazing. I recommend the meats section, where else can you load up on endless bone marrow, pork loin, and tender prime rib? . . The seafood section was decent as well, although not exceptional compared to other buffets. I do have to give it to the mussels though, the white wine butter sauce they sit in is DIVINE. They also have your usual crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Sadly no raw oysters.. . The asian section is hit and miss. I really liked the pork belly fried rice as well as the takoyaki. The sushi section was abyssmal. There was no sashimi and the rolls are cookie cutter rolls like the California Roll or the Spicy Tuna roll. The California Roll isn't even the delicious kind, it has the unchopped kani (crab) with cucumber. It's pretty much the same kind of California Roll you'd find in a Safeway sushi box.. . But the desserts OH MAN. There are so many options. Apple cobbler, chocolatre lava cake, macarons, an assortment of sorbets and ice creams, and even these delicious dessert cones (chocolate cones with cream filling).. . Come at lunch on weekdays for the best bang for your buck. It will leave you filled up until 10PM (at least it did for me) A definite stop every time I'm in Vegas.
Best buffet in Vegas and probably the country. It's in the cosmopolitan, so everything is new and modern and clean. . . Some favorites were the prime rib, leg of lamb, beef ribs, bone marrow, adobado tacos, fried chicken, and the crab legs. In that order. I had some other stuff too but I kept coming back for these. . . For desert, I must have had 20 chocolate-oreo covered strawberries (they cost like $2 each in real life), some coconut macarons, and a scoop of mango gelato. . . I also had some diet coke (complimentary) to wash it all down, you know, like an American.. . Small gripe is that the waitstaff didn't come around too often, so we were left with a plethora of empty plates.. . Either way, I begrudgingly made the treacherous and seemingly endless walk back to their parking lot, with both an intense feeling of euphoria and self-loathing. One of the best and shameful dining experiences and I will be back!
One star is generous.  But there are no minus stars available.Ssooooooo disappointed.   Let's face it the Cosmopolitan commercials are better. They try to be hip and trendy with exotic food offerings but fail miserably. Dishes are dry and tasteless.  Spent almost $40 for carbs and sone sugar. What??!!!  No prime rib or turkey?  Oh ya mashed potatoes were pretty good and the white chocolate mousse thing okay.  Go to Bacchanel instead
Absolutely loved Wicked Spoon. We got there right when it opened so not much of a wait. Love the individual servings. The food taste freshly made. If you're a dessert fan, you'll appreciate Wicked Spoon. Huge selection of desserts. There is less variety of seAfood than Bacchanals but beside that my favorite buffet in Vegas.
When you're trying to feed a teenage boy there are times when you've got to go buffet. And,  as buffets go,  this one is pretty good. Great selection of small plates with something for everyone. Service was quite good. Don't miss the raspberry macaroons on the dessert bar.
Two lines for payment and tables.. Food was good.. a lot of variety, but nothing which was outstandingly delicious. Felt that only the desserts lived up to the pricethey were charging. Service was very good though and so was the presentation of the food in tapas sized portions.
This place was good but I can't give five stars because I've been to most of the buffets in Vegas. The prime rib was chewy and even though they gave me a rib it was too dry. Our server was a little weird. At one point he stood behind my chair. I really don't like it when servers stand behind me while I'm trying to eat. Happy hour drinks were watered down. Food was good but not outstanding. The desserts were excellent. Luckily we had a 2 for 1 otherwise it would've costed us $82.
Expensive but worth the price.  Went to numerous buffets in Vegas and this is by far the best one.  The quality of the food is way above the rest.  Good selection from your usual buffet choices.  We went during brunch and had a good selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner food.  I would give it five stars, but our waitress was not tentative.  We had to keep asking for refills and ask for our plates to be removed.  But definitely a place I would recommend and will be back for.
Kind of a letdown after reading the reviews, was expecting something much better in both terms of food and atmosphere.. . The food is ok, not really over the top great nor is it bad either - just ok.  There are lots of options, I'll give them that.  Also our server was really good.. . Being at the Cosmopolitan I thought it would have a cooler vibe and atmosphere but it's unfortunately your usual cattle call buffet.
