We came to Vegas for a bowling tournament and we stayed at the rio for the first time and it was horrible! The room that we had smelled like smoked BBQ, I called guest services and they sent someone to ionized the room so it would not smell anymore. They asked us to  leave the room and return in two to three hours. So we did and when we came back it still smelled like smoked. I called them again and informed them that the room still smelled like smoke and they said they couldn't do anything else about it and they did not have any other rooms available. Which was fine and I totally understood. The bad part about this is that since it still smelled like smoke it triggered my asthma at night making it hard for me to sleep. . . So the day of check out I talk to the manager about the situation and he was so rude and he couldn't offer us anything to make up for our stay at the rio. The best thing he was able to do was not charge us for the resort fee. I felt like the manager did not try his best to help his customers. . . Honestly I don't think I will stay here again. . . I usually do not bad reviews but I was very disappointed at my stay here.
On 2/22 we had a company retreat in Rio.  We have reserved 16 rooms and checked in all at the same time, paid all by a company credit card.  There were not only room charges but also other charges like ball room, meeting equipment, beverage, and so on.  While believing we have paid for everything, today 6/6 I received this collection call from a collection agent.  His name is Nelson.  He said that it is reported to credit agency that $72.00 was unpaid.  All the 16 rooms and all the expenses, thousands of dollars were paid, and $72.00 was unpaid???. I paid for it.  Then I called in to the billing department trying to figure out how the mistake happened and trying to find a way to remove it from my record.  The lady in billing department was very rude and talked like I am someone trying to steal their money.  She totally ignore the fact (and refuse to check) we have already paid 15 other rooms with one credit card and all 16 rooms were checked in and out together.  Rio made a mistake and send me to collection without at least trying to inform me.  That event cost $5,000 and were all paid for.  I don't understand why Rio believes that I am not paying $72.00 but have paid all the other rooms and expenses.. This is a bad experience.  If you go to Rio please make sure you get your "Paid" invoice after you check out.  That part was my mistake to trust RIO.
I actually could care less that it off the strip. I love the pizza there, the pools, and the assistance you get when needed. . . Only down side is the rooms are dated. The beds are super comfy though and the rooms larger than most.. . Truly would stay here again. Maybe a suit next time for the upgrades?. . Thanks. Jenny
Clean room in newer tower but no coffee for the in-room coffee machine. I called housekeeping and they said we have to pay for it. Rio wins as the first hotel I have ever stayed at that does not offer complementary coffee. Sham on them!
All rooms are mini suites or larger, comes with a reefer and room safe....We used to get comp rooms with slot machine play... yea it's still a comp room but you have to pay a $20. resort fee plus tax... per day.  still a great deal but other casinos don't charge a resort fee if you get a comp. room.  I needed wheel chair on my last trip, it's not free they charge you daily,  the only good thing is you can take it with you vs. the other casinos will let it to you for free but it can't leave the property.
I play slots at the Rio the service gets worse ever time Im there!. There is service from the cocktail servers in the afternoon. the employees rather visit with each other than take care of the guest. . I played for two hours never got offered one water! Theres no excuse for this neglect.. The severn star guests playing next to me weren't happy either!
So we picked the Rio to try because the pictures of the pool looked awesome.   When we got there I was pretty happy with the room and casino, we went out to the pool and they have 4 total, 1 adult only that is closed except on the weekends.   We bought a football and everyone had an ok time.   When the adult pool finally opened we were all excited, dj, good music, we were throwing the football around and probably 15 people we didn't know all joined in.   That's when the problems began,  there was a lady who was probably in her 60s got mad, the football didn't go near her, but she wanted to lay on her noodle in the middle of the pool and us having fun bothered her, so the lifeguard was cool and Told us just to try and keep it on half of the pool and her to stay  on the other side. She got mad they didn't make us stop and got out.   Well more and more people joined in, about 20 people having fun just throwing a ball around,  someone new threw the ball across the other side of the pool cause he didn't know we weren't supposed to, so the lady gets back in the pool and lays directly in the middle of our side where we are throwing the ball.  Someone throws it and it lands next to her, she gets pissed and starts yelling, the manager comes over and tells us, this is our last warning, my.friendgoes to get the ball and the lady grabs his arm and starts screaming at him!!! So he gets the ball and starts to get out, the manager comes back over and tells him they are Gunna kick is out, huh????? Im sorry I don't think.We are the ones who grabbed anyone.   We watched about 15 people  leave the pool after that,  dead, nothing fun going on.  I wouldn't ever stay here again.  As a business why would you not want people having fun, drinking, not causing any issues, isn't that exactly what you.should want? Instead u allow someone to grab another person and threaten to kick the person who got grabbed out? Go to flamingo, great pool and they like their guests to have fun
I love this place. I was a member here in 1993 when it only had one tower and was a small gem if a place. We recently came back in 2012 and come regularly now. This is a great place, all the food in here is great. Sportsbook is nice and the casino is nice. My wife and I are reminded of our younger days here and it's so fun. I don't know why it is rated at 3 stars. Come on out an enjoy.
Terrible registration service right. 25 guests and only 3 staffers. Manager was no help in speeding line
We choose this hotel primarily because of the location and the fact that they are pet friendly for an additional $75. They must designate a floor to travels with pets, because we noticed quite a few other pups on the same floor as us...which is understandable and good. But the moment we walked I to our room, there was a potent smell of urine. You eventually get used to the smell but definitely not what you'd expect walking in. They do have a couple designated areas for the pups but kind of hard to get to. There is one next to the Indian restaurant...just follow the paw prints. And the other one is through the front of the hotel. . . Our room didn't have any trash cans or a coffee maker. They did have a one cup coffee maker-Kerigue(sp?) but no free coffee cups. However they did have coffee cups in the mini bar, that was impossible to get into. . . Another odd thing about the room we stayed in was, a see through glass from the shower/bath into the room. For a second, I thought I was in a love motel in Korea, since it's common there, but not for a room with two queen beds. . . Overall it was okay. The great thing about this hotel is it can be cheaper but it has the free shuttle to and from the strip and it has an easy exit and entrance to the freeway. . . FYI- if you book through hotels.com, just be aware that they tack on a resort fee that allows you to use the gym and spa (not full services). . The spa itself was nice and have a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. They also have full spa services that I didn't utilize.
Very disappointed. Won't stay here again. Stayed here only for WSOP. Front desk service slow. No coffee in room. Room stunk. Key did not work twice on different days. Filthy head boards. Old pillows. Waited 20 minutes for valet, so we self parked. When we returned to our car, we found a major dent in the door.
I didn't stay at this hotel but my brother, his wife and kids did. The suite they stayed in was pretty nice. Pretty spacious, clean and comfy with a nice view of the pool area. . . The pool area was also another nice thing about this hotel - they have four big ones - one was even heated and a couple of hot tubs. . . My brother and I tried out their new Zipline - it was fun but not intense and I guess a little expensive for a minute ride but it did give you a nice view.. . This is a pretty nice hotel - fair price and I would considering staying here next time.
I stayed here for 2 nights, nice and spacious hotel lots of activity here. The pool is awesome , sports book deli is the best, but its the little things that I didn't like. No free coffee in rooms ! Oh yeah if you book smoking rooms , you'll also be lumped in with dog friendly. Sooo get ready for dogs to be barking or whining while their owners are gambling or have just left them in the room for hours at a time.
I don't know if I will ever stay on-strip again! Normally I stay at the excalibur, and with the resort fee I end up paying the same amount as I paid for an ENORMOUS SUITE at this Hotel! I was extremely impressed by how comfortable the bed was. It was also very close to the Strip, and with the shuttle there was practically no difference. My only grip was the fact that the Shuttle only ran until about 10pm, which isn't really conducive to going out and having fun in Las Vegas. Otherwise, I would probably go here again!
This place is the most dishonest casino I've ever stayed in my 20 years going to Las Vegas I request the rooms non-smoking and guess what we get a smoking room begin to complain downstairs to a manager  she told us that they will spray my room with chemicals and they will not change my room because they don't have any rooms available we have to stay away for 3 hours , when we came back is still smell like a  dead skunk this is not The same Rio that was 10 years ago, now they charge $11  for Reservation plus &25 per day for I don't know what  will never go back to this place there costumer service not exist zero totally agree with previous reviewer Gevorg exactly same thing happened to us
