It my was first time staying in MGM Grand Hotel, so my girls  and  I stayed in a  two queen bed grand room. The first thing a lady would noticed is always the bathroom. I love the newly renovated and will lighted mirror because it had perfect light for getting ready for a day or night out. Also, it was spacious. I enjoyed how the concierge  and the front desk would check on us when we checked in and checked out of the hotel.  I was impressed because when I stayed in Venetian I never had this approach from their concierge or front desk staff eventhough we stayed in a Bella Suite. I gave it a star deduction because when I opened the bedside table. There was two crunched up used kleenex tissues in the first drawer, which I understood that it was hard to spot for the housecleaning staff. Therefore, I called the frontdesk and mentioned about it. When my girls and I were out and about, we asked the housekeeping staff to clean our room. When we get arrive back to our "clean room," I expected that the used crunched up kleenex  should have been taken out because I already mentioned about the incident to the front desk from previous night that we checked in.  When I opened the drawer where the used kleenex, there it was staring at me.  LOL I am not touching that used kleenex because I am fully aware of VRE and MRSA ( you know what I am implying if you are working a healthcare field LOL).  Surprisingly, the housekeeping did not AGAIN spot the dirty kleenex in the bedside table drawers. Anyways, I took 1 star off because of housekeeping. Overall, I enjoyed the stay. Espicially, the Hakassan nightclub bouncers and security staff were friendly because they do look after their guest. I am very thankful for their help! We will be back again. Thank you MGM Grand Hotel
This is my favorite hotel ,been coming here for years, you can always catch me in their sports book, for some reason i win here, it's a cool place to visit, if your a boxing fan, then you got to visit the mgm. i enjoy everything about the mgm, its close to everything on the strip.
Stayed here several times and at various MLife hotels but finally stopped being lazy and got my MLife card re-printed to earn points for all the money I spend in LV.  . . Stayed here recently for MDW - had a good time enjoying the sun and laying out at the pool.  I liked that there are various pool areas.. . Kudos to the dancing DJs - they played great music and they were fun to watch.. . Recommendation - would be nice if there was more option for food in the pool area.  Also, would like if there were more options for non-alcoholic drinks other than a strawberry daiquiri - I was craving smoothies and had to walk back into the casino to buy it.  Considering the pool area catered to family and kids, I think smoothies would be a hit.. . The room was nice - had a queen double.  I liked the fact that Wi-Fi was included - I wish more hotels would include it in the cost of the room - we spend enough already when in LV.  . . I definitely would stay here again when the price is right,. . It was also the first time I flew to LV - normally I drive from Cali but didn't want to deal with the traffic going home. Flying was worth it.
Review based on Stay-Well Rooms.. . I have stayed at MGM three times in the 20 years it has been around. Damn, that's a long time.  I remember when it was a Wizard of Oz theme, complete with rainbows and yellow brick roads. Does anyone else remember that? Well, the yellow brick roads have come and gone, along with that awesome theme park out back.... But who really wants to go to a theme park in 100 degree weather anyways?  Nowadays it's modern with a touch of that old-school Golden Lion charm.  The square footage has only gotten bigger, oh wait it hasn't? Damn, this place is huge!  . Restaurants are bountiful with everyone under the sun opening up shop at this mega-resort..... You have Michael Mina, Tom Colicchio, Emril Lagasse, plus others.  Hell, there is even a Rainforest Cafe. HAHA!  The Buffet is pretty generic, it always was. Yawn! The pool is anything but though.  It's large and complete with a lazy river.  Any pool that comes with a lazy river is golden in my book.  For you twenty somethings that come to Vegas to party, Wet Republic is one the best day clubs in town.  Not as great as Encore Beach Club, but Wynn always does things bigger and better, so that's not really a fair comparison! Hakkasan is here and the prices are so silly, it's hard to take it seriously.  Men can expect to pay $100 for entry on a weekend, and wait up to three hours to get in.  I guess there is a price to pay when Calvin Harris and Tiesto are the resident DJ's.  The monorail out back gets you to places a little quicker, but at $5 one way per person, you are better off to cab it. . The rooms and guest experience is what made my stay at MGM worthy of 4 stars, even though Mirage is an overall better hotel.  I checked in very late and the front desk agent was so helpful and attentive, he even waived my $25 resort fee.  He didn't have to do it, but since I was there so late, he went out of his way to make sure I got value out of my stay.  Very classy on his part.  He even upgraded me to a Stay-Well room.  I had no idea what that meant, but when I arrived in my room, they were sure to remind me. The room had an air purifier, a Vitamin-C shower and many more little touches.  The beds were ok..... Mirage's beds were much more comfortable, but definitely nothing worthy of a complaint.  The bathroom came with a shower/tub combo, but the bathroom was larger than the one at The Mirage.  Bath amenities were on the upscale end and the room even came with a bath robe.  The desk was well laid out and had plenty of USB plug-ins and outlets.  While MGM isn't necessary a top pick when it comes to Las Vegas rooms, a one night refresher in this room definitely puts it on my Vegas radar next time I want a nice room with superior guest service.
Got a suite for my wife and kids on the way to Arizona.  Suite was awesome and my kids loved how big and spacious it was.  The casino was awesome and the kids loved the lazy river.
I've got to say, I was a little apprehensive that Vegas would be a bit tacky and possibly a bit too 'in your face' for me but after staying in the MGM I truly loved the place! The hotel was beautiful, sheek, well laid out and the rooms were stunning with fantastic views. I found American service left much to be desired in many places but every place I visited in the MGM the service was friendly and much faster! I was pleasantly surprised that regardless of allowing smoking the casino maintained a clean, clear atmosphere unlike a few others sadly. The facilities available were great athough I didn't get the chance to use them all! Would definately reccomend this place and hope to stay again soon!
This is one huge casino. I've been in here many times over the years. . . This casino has a great location. You could spend your entire vacation here and never leave the hotel.. . I've seem several concerts here as well. Great venue!
I have not stayed at this hotel, but have visited the casino many times. On my most recent visit, I had a strange experience here. As we walked towards the entrances from the strip, there was a strong feces smell, and upon entering the casino, the smell of cologne or Ax body spray hits you in the face. I don't know why they are pumping this scent in here, but it is gross... I could almost taste it.... ugh. On a good note, I did win here! On a bad note, they had no waitresses walking around to serve cocktails. Also, the casino is just too large and easy to get lost in.... it certainly isn't my favorite place, but I will most likely be back again in the future.
Love this place. It's great for all ages, and don't get me started on how comfortable the beds are. The service is fast and very responsive.
Mgm grand is overated.  Check in takes about an hour.  They charge you a 28 dollar per night resort fee.  The rooms were nice but noisy and loud we were on the 25 th floor and could hear sirens and cars on the atrip.  The a/c doesnt cool the room down enoigh even at its lowest temperture level.
By far one of the best places in Vegas to spend your vacation.  With cheap rooms (esp during the week), HUGE casino floor plan, and delicious food, you won't be disappointed.  I left wanting to stay another week, always helps when you win money :)
This was our first time in Vegas as adults and our stay at the mgm went by without a hitch! It's a beautiful hotel, lots and lots to do inside. We could have spent our entire 5 days in the hotel and still not done everything!   I was pleasantly surprised that no matter how crowded it was it never felt like I was trying to wade my way through sardines. Pool area is gorgeous, we had a great bartender every morning at the lobby bar (i wish i had gotten his name) room service was on point, restrooms were always clean. I swear every time I went in one they had someone attending to it!  Only draw is that we paid $25 for a resort fee per day for wifi that we had a hard time using.
Came here with my friend during the week. We got a great rate on an executive suite and the room was very nice. It was nice and spacious with a large bathroom. Check in was pretty quick and the guy that checked us in was very friendly. The staff throughout our entire stay was extremely nice and very helpful. We also went down to the buffet in the morning to enjoy the unlimited champagne brunch. The pool was very nice and check out was quick as well. I was a little nervous about some of the reviews but my experience was great and would definitely stay here again!
Worst, more horrible, awful service and hotel stay I have EVER had. And I travel a LOT. I'm in Vegas 2-3 times a year and have NEVER experienced this degree of incompetency!. . Ok, now that you understand the degree of awfulness, where to begin:. . I booked and paid online reservation which includes early check in and late check out (for $60-80 extra) because I knew our plane arrived at noon. We waited in an hour long line to be told that rooms weren't available until 2pm and that she "couldn't see" our early check in reservation. We dropped off luggage with bell desk and went to pub for lunch and a drink and to waste the first 2 hours of our vacation. . . At 2pm, I called and was rudely informed that check in time was 3pm actually so I still needed to wait some more.. . At 3:05pm, they finally called to give us our room number. If every single room needed to be available by 3pm, why were we the last to get a room if we had already waited for 3 freaking hours!?!?!. . We get to room at 3:15 and I call for luggage. Told it will take 5-15 minutes and not to leave the room while we wait for it. After 45 minutes, I call back to be told "oops, our ticket must not have printed so your luggage is still sitting here. It will right up". No apology.. . Luggage finally arrives around 4:15 (another hour wasted) and the main handle on the large piece of luggage is broken off!! The bell man doesn't mention this but when I see it and ask him he tells me that it was already like that. Um, NO it was NOT.. . We have finally had enough and call hotel management. Joey, the customer service rep, tells me that she CAN SEE my early check in and out payments, doesn't know why the front desk lady couldn't. SCREAM!. She then offers to refund the resort fees (about $25/day) and 2 free breakfast meals (about $50 value). That is clearly not enough to make up this mess but at this point we are just wanting to get down to the pool and start the vacation.. . After relaxing and partying for two days, we verify we have late check out so that we can sleep in and catch later flight. We do. Yay! Since we got in about 5am, we needed to sleep past the normal 11am-noon check out. Except apparently the housekeeping staff didn't get this memo, or didn't even bother to check because TWICE that afternoon while we were still trying to sleep, they knocked loudly and entered our room. Yes, entered. The MGM rooms did not have a door lock or deadbolt so without jamming a door under the handle, there is NO way to keep unwanted people from just opening your door and looking inside! They did not apologize, just closed the door and walked off. We tried to go back to sleep. And then they did it a 2nd time. Are you freaking kidding me?!?. . We go to check out and guess what has NOT been applied to our bill. The refunds. And the front desk tells me that the offer was for 2 free breakfast buffets, not room service, so she will only credit one of them. Again, at this point, I was so ready to get out of there that I didn't care. . . I will NEVER EVER stay at MGM again and recommend you don't either.
An ok place to stay but I wouldn't stay here again or recommend it to anyone else. They accidentally gave away my room to someone else after I left my laptop and a digital SLR camera in the room. Horrible service, long lines for check-in/issues, internet doesn't work (it won't even let me log on) despite a $20 resort fee which pays for it, huge number of rooms and long walks everywhere. I'm about a 20 minute walk from my car which is in the parking garage.
The MGM Grand invited me back to stay for a night after my sub par experience last year.  They'd improved in several aspects since my last stay.  The staff was much more polite this time, consistently, and the check in process ran much smoother, notably.  The hotel is still a massive, sometimes over-crowded behemoth, and the valet service is still incredibly slow, but they definitely impressed me more this time than last.
Fabulous stay at the MGM Grand! MY husband and I went to Vegas this past week to celebrate our belated honeymoon. From the time we checked into the hotel and throughout the week the service was top notch. I know some of the reviews talk about terrible experiences which would make any traveler weary but we got lucky. It is at the very beginning of the strip so it's a long walk when exploring the entire strip but as it was our first time in Vegas together we wanted to do it all. The pool was great, I liked how he lazy river didn't open until 10:00am making it bearable to get up and get a spot at a decent time. . . The first day we got a daybed for a pretty good price and received great service from Shell. We went back again the second day and again had a great time. The one thing that was a major pain was the cable in the rooms. It continually cut out, who watches TV in Vegas you may ask? We watched TV while recovering from the sun and getting ready for the night and also watched the first World Cup game making it crazy annoying at the most inconvenient of times. We don't have cable at home so it really wasn't the end of the world. . . I wish I knew more about the restaurants but unfortunately the only time we ate in the hotel was drunken late night room service. All and all we had a great time and may check out the Skylofts next time.
I liked the room. The customer service however was pitiful. The dealers were rude, the waitresses were rude. The valet drivers were rude, etc... Makes me want to spend my money elsewhere next time, that's for sure... No bueno
MGM is a decent place to stay if you can get a good rate... Check-in/out is a waiting game, as with any other hotel on the Strip. My room was actually much nicer than I expected, and I especially loved the blackout shades. They really work!... Internet was fairly fast, the minibar selection is good, and I was fortunate to be on a quiet floor.. . Their higher-end restaurants were also better than expected, except for Fiamma- blecch. . Negatives included boring, often rude blackjack dealers, poor cocktail service in the blackjack area, very little shade available at the pools unless you purchase a cabana (and, you know, it's HOT in the Vegas sun... there was also very limited waitstaff working the pools), the room air conditioner couldn't keep my room cool, and huge crowds everywhere. . Overall, if you like staying on the Strip, this isn't a bad place. There are better hotels, and there are certainly worse places
Meh... . Downhill spiral with the nickle and diming. First the check in line is 30 minutes with only half the stations filled. But if you look at the mlife line there are three attendant's doing nothing and the line is empty.. . So you get to the front of the line and they say hello and tell you there are no rooms available and the wait is four hours, but to enjoy yourself in the casino.. So I ask "there are no rooms available?" Not at this time but would you like to upgrade? Sure. 12 bucks.. OK week see you back at three. Wait what was the upgrade for? Oh a nice room. But there aren't any available but if you want a room that is done it's $20.. . . Mlife grants no benefits either unless you blue a lot of cash in the casino.. . In done with the strip and their tourist based hostage plans. From now on its an off strip property.
If your looking to pickup on hot woman MGM is the spot! They also have Hakkasan, the hottest club in Las Vegas. The slot machines don't pay out for shit.
I have stayed at the MGM Las Vegas several times over the past 10 years both for business and pleasure. I always enjoyed the great service, food outlets, and nightlife.  My sister and I recently stayed three nights in The Grand Tower. The two-queen room was great. The beds and linen were nice and comfortable and bless the man who installed the blackout curtains. Upon arrival, I did notice that the toiletries were not new. This included a lotion that was half used. Needless to say, I am glad I brought my own. Housekeeping did a great job over the next few days even organizing our makeup on towels.  What disappointed me this stay was the feeling that I had to beg for service. When I got it, it was wonderful, getting it was the problem. The first night we had to practically stand on our heads to get noticed by service staff in the Lobby Lounge. I saw a waitress at the other end of the bar and we waited about 10 minutes before just going up to the bar and ordering our drinks. The bartender was nice and drinks were great but moved on after not being able to find a waitress again. We found our way to the Centrifuge Bar. Again my sister and I stood there twiddling out thumbs for 10 minutes waiting for a bartender to acknowledge us. Again the bartender was nice and the drinks were ok but we did not want to wait for the service staff to get around to us again. We gambled on slots for a good 45 minutes after and not once did I see a waitress. For me gambling a drinking go hand in hand without one the other is not as fun. I was beginning to think that the MGM just did not want me to drink or gamble and I should just go to bed. The next morning we had an early and long day so I decided to order room service. This is something I have done hundreds of times but the sticker shock this time was enough to say I would never stay at the MGM again. I ordered two bagels with cream cheese, two coffees, two bottles of water and a bowl of sliced fruit. The total came to $92.00!!!! Then when I asked her to charge it to the room another thing I have dome a million times and was told I had to pay for it upfront which to avoid any further delay I did. The gentleman that brought the tray was very nice and the food was as exciting as bagels get but for sure not worth the $92.00. The third night we centered on going to the Hakkassan club to see DJ Tiesto. This is where I say I have 10 years as a nightclub manager in a major city and 10 years as a Catering Manager for a popular hotel chain. Nothing kills me then a poorly thought out nightclub. There was hundreds of people in line but being used to Vegas I bought pre-sale tickets. We got in pretty fast. But then came the 5 flights of stairs to get to the first dance floor area. It screamed fire hazard. A further set of stairs led you to a main room, which is where Tiesto was supposed to play. The lay out was 70% VIP Booths 3% Bar (as far as I could see) and the most cramped dance floor I have ever seen (as of that moment). We stayed for about 10 minutes before we decided to go find a drink, which did not happen since we were corralled back into a hallway that led to a stairwell. We decided to take the stairwell to the hip hop room which had a dance floor the size of a condo living room and at least a hundred people trying to dance. We danced for about 10 more minutes, still needing a drink but with  no bar in sight, we left. Again this room was about 70% VIP booths.  It was almost 1am and I would say 80% of those booths were empty. We braved the 5 flights of stairs out of this potential towering inferno and went to the Lobby Bar. At this point, I just wanted to drink and saw the $70 Tiesto tickets as a wash. We arrived at the Lobby Bar to what looked like 4 waitresses huddled at other the end of the bar. Waited......Waited.... And then just went up to the bar. Drinks were good but at this point we just called it a night. One bright note is that I dropped my phone and Lost and Found had it. The breakfast buffet was eh. We ate at Hecho in Vegas which was pretty good. The pool areas were nice and the whole casino in very clean. I just feel like the gold standard is gone and could pay less to get the same at another casino. FYI New York New York had the best Irish Bar ever. Maybe I will stay there next time so I can drink and gamble on my schedule not the wait staff's.
Grand tower is luxurious!
Love this place the grand rooms are great. Lots of restaurants.  We come here frequently.
I stay 3-4 times in Vegas a year.  . .   Don't expect anything super exceptional here, but do expect to spend your extra cash.  I loved my 2 bedroom-south tower suite, but that was about it.  Valet is good, check in not too bad, express check out is great.  The cocktail waitress service is sketchy, (just not enough of them on the floor).  Sports book needs some personality.  And come on, only 1 drink ticket per $100 bet!  Most places will give you 2 for a $50.  The pool was good.  I had an issue with a 2 for 1 offer for KA (which I received as part of my stay offer).  After 15 minutes the best they said they could do was charge me for the most expensive tickets and then they would honor the 2-1... I laughed.  Nowhere in my offer did it say that.   (Just another example of how this place sucks the juice out of your wallet)   Box office sent me toM Life to see what they could do.  The rep (Jan) was rude and unaccommodating.  Kept telling me they only did 30% off while I tried to show her my 2-1 email on my phone, but of course she didn't want to read it.  She had me speak to someone on the phone who apologized and basically said NOPE.  Finally just had to walk away while Jan was still going on and on...Very scammish.  Stay away from Wolfgang Pucks (that's a WHOLE diff story!)  Tried the "real" fitness center but they wanted an extra $10 per day to use it, and that's on top of the dreaded $25 per night resort fee.  The "fake" fitness center was free but only had cardio equip.  Slots don't play or pay with you (as most of the MLife casinos).   As for stays, this place is a one and done for me.
Well, the wife and I are not pool people.  We love to go sight seeing, not lay around a pool. I understand that the MGM has "an awesome pool setup", but we could have cared less.. . When we got there, they sent us to our room, which was a "modern updated" version, complete with 'open sink area' and glass doors to both shower AND a separate glass door for the toilet.  Immediately we said no!   We called down to the front desk and asked for another room.  Of course it cost us $20 more a night (they have to gig you every chance they get).  . . We moved up one floor and toward the front of the hotel.  The room was more to our taste.  However, the air conditioner had trouble keeping up.  We had to set it on 65 degrees and kept it there all 4 days.  It stayed moderately cool, but never got to ice cold. The tub had issues draining at times, which indicates to me that the hotel is getting old and the plumbing is not up to par.. . Of course there is the $25 a night charge for "resort fee".  Rapists....... . The workout room on the 4th floor consisted of a few treadmills, elliptical gliders, and some other funky machine.  No free weights or machine weights or even a pull up bar.. . The hotel had a certain smell every time we entered from the outside.  No matter which door we came in, it always smelled like they were trying to cover up a musty smell or something.  We went into a lot of hotels on the Strip and none of them came close to smelling like this.. . This hotel is at the south end of the strip, which makes for longer walks to things. Bottom line is we will not ever be staying here again; first and last for both of us.  I guess we can say that we had sex at the MGM without ever having to take our clothes off !!. . . Oh yeah, Mike, who works the crap tables in the evenings, is an a$$hole.  He will talk about you right in front of you.  Unprofessional.
For the last 5 times I been to Vegas in the past 2 years I stood at the MGM 4 times. It feels like my second home , and if I gamble it has to be at the MGM. Love their roulette tables . I know this casino like the palm of my hand. I love that wet republic is here and I can just walk to my room when it's over lol. Love how their Starbucks is open 24 hours .
Well I am about to book a room for July 25-27 at the MGM so obviously I like it there. I have been to the MGM so many times now that it feels comfortable to stay there. . .  However....The last couple of stays we had issues: first issue was when we checked in and got our key, my friends and I went up to the room and when we opened the door we saw 2 people in bed and shoes, clothes and suitcases in the room, apparently the room was double booked. That was VERY awkward and uncomfortable and annoying because that was a long way to carry our heavy bags for nothing. I stayed with the bags on that floor and my friend went down to inform them. They were really nice and apologetic, comped us 2 buffets and sent someone up to take all our bags to the new room. So, I was not too upset Inconvenienced a little but they fixed it.. . The second issue was that the AC in our room stopped working properly and they had to send some guy up to repair it, he could not fix it so they had him come up with a new one and install it....this was all happening during a 2 hour time period when we had to get ready to go out for the night and meet up with friends, I would have rather they just switched us into another room just like ours that we could get ready in without this repairman staring uncomfortably at us while we are curling our hair and doing our makeup. VERY awkward, again. That particular situation was probably not handled the best way but at least we had working ac again.. . So here I am, giving them another chance, hopefully all goes well.. .  The  good things about this place is the pool! And the late night food court right there for when you are too drunk, tired or sore to hunt down food elsewhere at 2 or 3 in the morning. There is always a buzz in this casino all day and night, I like that, it makes you feel like you are part of something.. .  You could walk across the street to New York New York to see what is going on and it almost zaps the fun and energy right out of you....too quiet/not much going on. MGM is a lively casino for a younger and middle age crowd, not the right casino if you are looking for a peacful vacation but who really wants that in Vegas!. . I give 3 stars for now, it is a really nice casino, fun place to stay, more stars will come if my visit in July goes smoothly
Nothing really special to this place. Check in was longer than the lines at the airport.  Rooms were just like any others.. nothing fancy. ..... No coffee makers no small fridge although they can give you one on request. The 2 stars are for the pool area selection since my kids were happy. Everything else inside is expensive. . . Be warned about the $200 security deposit HOLD for property damage. I was told they won't charge me but it's been 4 days since I checked out and still no refund...
Wow. I have NEVER been to a hotel quite like this one. I attended the Beachbody Coach Summit in 2014 (for work!) and stayed here since the summit was on their property. When I checked in, I felt like I was at an amusement park as the line was over an hour long!. . The rooms are pretty big but the entire hotel smells like Vegas. They are people EVERYWHERE.. . The pluses: GREAT pool (I should say pools) and lazy river and meal options everywhere!
Giving 2 stars only because MOST of the staff were friendly. . . I had booked a room over the phone some time in advanced and specifically requested for a smoking room after the concierge offered a choice. When I arrived to check in I was asked if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking again, just to be told all the smoking rooms were booked but "to make up for it" the concierge told me he would put us close to an elevator so we could get back to the lobby to smoke. Got to the room which was indeed close to an elevator but had an unsightly view of rockson a rooftop and green lights. . I asked the concierge at the information desk if at any point I could switch to a smoking room and she recommended that I call during checkout the next morning to see if anything became available. . . My fiance and I are chain smokers so we didn't spend much time in our room. At one point my fiance forgot the card to the room and was locked out for an hour as I was asleep because he needed to go to the lobby to smoke. One staff member was kind enough to give him his phone so he could call me but I was out cold.. . I called at 11 AM and nothing had opened up. I called again about an hour later and the gentleman was kind enough to offer to call as soon as a room became available. I called again a little over an hour later because we needed to meet with family and I had no intentions of spending my vacation playing the waiting game. The concierge told me there was nothing she could do for me and from what she was saying it appeared there was no note about giving me a call as soon as a room became available.. . After spending time with family and touring the strip I came back to the information desk  hoping a miracle could happen and a room became available. The was a glimmer of hope as I saw her write down another room number, but after speaking with the housekeeping manager she told me nothing was available. . . I don't understand why an establishment would even offer a smoking or non-smoking option while booking the room if nothing is gonna be available. When I book a smoking room, I would hope a smoking room has been saved for me when I check in. Are those rooms just on a first come first serve basis? If so, why even tease the guest by offering it while booking the room? I also find it hard to believe that out of the several hundred people that checked out, no smoking rooms became available at any of the times I called.
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #138 - #365. . One word to describe MGM GRAND and that is "MASSIVE!" That's right, this hotel and casino is one of the biggest hotels on the strip and formally in the world until the hotel in Thailand broke the record. This formally housed the, Wizard of Oz theme from 1993 - 1999 and ended it because the studio sold the rights to the movie. The only thing left that resembles the theme is the Emerald skin on the MGM hotel tower. . . Valet here takes forever to park and the registration area is huge! The check in clerk was pleasant and gave the upgrade skit as every other clerk I've encountered. We in the Grand Tower and it took about 5-8 minutes to get to the elevator from the lobby. Our room overlooked Excalibur, Luxor, Tropicana, and Mandalay Bay. The room was completely renovated and was impressed with the furnishings, floor to ceiling windows, comfy beds, and a high tech area to charge your gizmos. . . The casino is just as massive as the hotel and casino you can easily get lost unless you can read the signage. Pool is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel room and is layed out on a grand scale. Sadly, the lion exhibit is gone and replaced by TAP, Studio 54 is now Hakkasan, and they now have a 24/7 cafe, called Avenue 24. . . Staff here are very friendly and most are all smiles. I did have a pleasant experience here it's just too big for my taste. Preferably I would stick with my home base hotel, the Mirage. MGM is nice to visit, I just wouldn't want to stay here again in this ginormous cluster!. . The Mirage FTW!!
I had stayed at MGM 3 times before, and when it came time to book a room, we decided to forgo the cheaper rooms at Hooters or Excalibur in order to have an MGM experience like I had had before.. . We originally had booked a West Wing King through Mlife, but a day or so later they sent an offer to upgrade to a Stay Well King for only $18 extra a night so we took it. . . The first issue came at check-in, although admittedly, it may be my own fault. When I booked through Mlife, I could have sworn it said the resort fee was only $18 dollars instead of the $25 it looked to charge elsewhere. We even commented to each other that we would have an extra $14 to gamble with. Once I upgraded my room, my resort fee said $25 a night, but I figured I would clear it up upon check-in. When checking in, the front desk attendant said he had never heard of anything but $25 being charged. It made us question our own sanity as we were sure it said $18 when we originally booked. But again, maybe we just read it wrong. However, when we got to the room we decided to check it out online, only to find the resort charge was now $28, which only made it seem like the front desk clerk was lying to us. . . The 2nd issue to me was the $200 room security deposit that was not mentioned a all while booking. That would probably be something you want to tell your guests before they arrive, and honestly is $200 the casino didn't get from me as I had planned to blow through all the money I had transferred into that bank account. Well, in hindsight, maybe they did get it from me because I have yet to receive my security deposit back from them. Still waiting. . . The third issue, and a minor one, is the remote control only worked if you pressed the buttons with the force of a thousand men. Annoying yes, but manageable. . . The fourth issue, and probably the most inconvenient and troubling was that our toilet backed up and overflowed onto the bathroom floor for no apparent reason. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. About 30-45 minutes later we had to call the front desk again and ask if they were going to send someone up so we could use the bathroom. They said they couldn't guarantee when someone was going to be up to fix it. Someone finally came about 20 minutes after the second call and plunged the toilet but did not clean up the floor. They said they would send housekeeping to clean it. Housekeeping never came, and the mess around the toilet remained throughout the rest of our stay, which fortunately was only another half of a day. . . . One the positive side, the bed was nice and the blackout curtains worked.. . . We booked at the MGM for the experience, but afterwards we regretted not saving the money by staying at Hooters. We expected better, and MGM certainly left quite a bit of emptiness in our weekend.
I had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off! I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water!!! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!
Great hotel but avoid the Wet Republic Club/Pool portion the employees will try to sell you on. It's a 3+ hour wait in line for nothing but an expensive entree fee, expensive liquor and half of your day wasted. Avoid this bullshit at all costs and just go to the regular pool.
The hotel is massive, and so was the line while checking in.  It was odd because check-in time was 3:00 and we were there by 11:00.  I wasn't feeling well, so after waiting in line for about 30 minutes (not too bad considering the length of the line) we paid $30 for early check in.  I'll note here that the $25 a day resort fee irks me, as your room rates aren't really as advertised if you are charging a mandatory fee.  If you say: "Hey, you can stay at this hotel for free!  Mandatory resort fees are $350/night though!"  Not really free is it?  I was aware of the fee  ahead of time, but I'm just not happy about it, since I did not use their wifi, their newspaper, or even their cardio room or pool.  When we checked in, they reminded us that we had a $50 food credit.. . Our room (New Grand King) had a great view of New York New York and Excaliber (I know not every room can have a million dollar view, but ours was good).  The bed and pillows were great, and the furnishings decent.  There was a bit of a rust stain on the bathroom counter behind the faucet and some chipped tile in the tub as well as the shower curtain looking like it was falling apart keeping the bathroom from looking 100%.  The blackout shade was not in it's track the first few times we used it, but after we figured that out, it worked great.  The partial shade stopped working for us though.  . . When we got our players club card we were told we should charge everything to the room and check with them before checking out to see if anything could be taken off.  We did so, but only losing $200 didn't rate us any comps.  We were asked to sign for the charges to our room and our resort fees, which just had a total, but not an itemized list.  After receiving an email with an itemized list we noticed that the $50 food credit was not taken off.  Billing is closed on the weekends so we will have o wait until Monday to see if it gets resolved.
This was my first time staying at MGM  Grand. We had a Loft Room in honor of my daughter's 21st Birthday. We wanted to celebrate in style and MGM grand didn't disappoint! It was a 2 story suite booked by my daughters fiancee. . . Since it was a loft room, we didn't have to wait in the regular lobby, we had a separate check in and we had our room key available immediately. . . The room was above and beyond what we expected. It was a 2 bedroom suite with a pool table, bar, concierge, living room, sauna and more. It was an unbelievable experience and the service was amazing. Housekeeping was incredible we stayed in our room most of our stay enjoying all its amenities. Absolutely beautiful room...we will be back in August. Thank you!
I have stayed here a few times. The last time there was a ton of construction and rerouting people, it got a little annoying. That being said, average wait time for check in when its busy and not check in time is anywhere from 15-45 minutes. The staff at the desk is always friendly. I usually get the spa suite when I am here and love it to death.  A downside to staying here is the rooms are about a 10-15 minute walk to the pool.  Not a lot of shade, better get there early if you want a spot in the shade.  aside from a few minor things, I would defiantly stay here again
They get zero stars we have had our suite now booked for 5+ months we go to check in and they tell us SORRY you have been down graded!!! WTF what Hotel does this???!!! NEVER book here you don't know what you till you check in!!
I've stayed at MGM Signature but this was my first time staying at the MGM Grand.  I love the Signature and I would recommend their suites over the MGM but if you do decide to stay at the MGM Grand here's a little warning I wish somebody would have told me. We booked a Jack Pot deal through Southwest. We got a West Wing King. So we arrive at the hotel and check in and begin walking to our room and about 10 minutes later we finally reach the doors entering the west wing. All of a sudden we felt like we were in a college dorm. The carpet was grimy the walls gray concrete The rooms have no view and they're extremely hot. Apparently the air-conditioning doesn't work in the dungeon.  Not ideal for sure but we could have made it work if it didn't take what felt like 30 minutes to get from the lobby to our room!! This place is HUGE so from our room to the pool would have been like half a days journey. We paid some ridiculous upgrade rate to move our room to the Grand Tower just so we wouldn't spend the whole weekend walking back and forth. This is one of those hikes where if your left your phone in the room you'd just say screw it.. . 2nd issue for me was the staff. There were at least two pit bosses and 4 dealers that literally made me want to leave tables.  I've never had so many people scold me for my hand placement or talking loudly with my friends. Apparently being a little rowdy in Vegas is now illegal? There were some dealers that were a lot of fun but overall I would rate the staff at MGM at a 6 out of 10. . There are much better places to stay in Vegas and for sure better places to gamble.. . One positive thing I want to make sure to throw in. We rented a cabana on the pool and was very reasonably priced. 800 min food and drink spend. Our waiter Joey was the best. Plus once Calvin Harris came on at Wet Republic they played it over their sound system. We had the best seat in the house. One of my top 5 pool days in Vegas
