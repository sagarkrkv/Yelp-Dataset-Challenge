I had high expectations as I had heard wonderful things but honestly the terrible computer graphics/hologram at the end just ruins the whole show. There were some cool acrobatics but I've seen better in some of their traveling shows.. . Apparently what they were best known for was the vertical fighting scene which is the finale, and since the performer died in 2013 they replaced it with a ridiculous 1980s video game looking thing where you can't even tell what is happening.... . Seriously, if they no longer feel safe doing that then just do a new scene with a normal fight or something. The graphics was just stupid and confusing and made me just feel very disappointed in what would have otherwise been a very cool show.
I've seen several Cirque du Soleil shows and Ka is definitely at the top of the list. These shows are absolutely amazing and unbelievable. The people who make up these shows are incredibly talented and have mind-blowing stunts. The show is entertaining from start to finish and when it was over I wanted to see more. I have a real respect for the acrobats in this show. I have trouble putting into words what I have seen these acrobats do. Their skills are one-of-a-kind.
I love the theater and this is probably my all time favorite show.  Something about the theater being built just for this show ups the ante and the "wall" is just awesome.  This is perfect for 'dragging " the hubby to because it reminds me of all the bad sci-fi movie sets men watch....but don't let that fool you.  It is an awe inspiring, well produced show.  I have seen it several times.  Probably my second favorite theater and production was Lion King in Toronto at the Princess of Wales theater.  Highly recommend.. . Oh, I guess I am unsure if they still cut out the last part.  Some people are still saying that they have changed it.  I guess I am referring to the show prior to the accident.  It is sad, but all of these performers are performing risky, highly skilled acts.  There is an inherent risk.  I hope they are able to work out an appropriate way to replace that act.
Totally one of a kind and beautiful! The costumes and amazing and the movement in the stage is awesome!
I enjoyed Ka a few years ago and chose to rewatch it instead of seeing a different Cirque show because I felt my husband (who has never been to a Cirque show) would enjoy it's thematics. . .  Still a fun show with some surreal moments and bits of comedy mixed into the action.  However I am perplexed by their decision to replace the final battle with a poor projection.  I understand the reason being the fatal accident last year but other parts of the show use the same wiring and harnesses and the main issue really is the poor quality of the projection.  It's out of focus and seemingly low quality, it really detracts from the overall enjoyment of the show.  Honestly it ruins it.  Instead of a big epic finale, you get a long boring bad quality projection that you can't tell what is happening so you just wait for it to end.  I hope the producers of the show read these reviews and find a way to rework the show with a different scene instead of using that awful video.  It completely cheapened the expensive experience and I cannot recommend the show until they make changes.  I would have appreciated a note citing the change to the production before we purchased tickets.
The show is five-stars up until the end. Then, due to the death of a performer in a previous show, they replaced the final battle scene with a CGI video. This completely disrupts the momentum and flow of the performance. It's so baffling that it will compromise all of the previous acts in the show and you will not be able to think about anything else, unfortunately.. . They could have reworked the final battle scene to make it safer but they did the worst thing possible and put a video up on a screen, which is insulting and leaves the audience dumbfounded with no going back. It's very unfortunate because this used to be a great show. I recommend O and Mystere instead.
Good show for everyone.  A lot of action.  People flying all over the place.  Entertaining and full of action.  If you wear glasses bring them because the stage is far off, and you might not be able to catch everything without them.
WOW! I expected this show to be mind blowing but instead got something that barely held my attention at times. The guy that was sitting next to me was so bored he fell asleep for most of the show. There were however, parts of the show that were pretty awesome though, but not enough to feel that the ticket prices are justified. This is not one of the better Cirque Du Soleil shows in my opinion. I've seen better for sure. I wouldn't have been so annoyed by this show, and probably would have gave it three stars if they didn't present the final battle scene on a crappy low budget projector! I mean c'mon now! It could have at least been in high quality! Me and my friend kinda felt ripped off or cheated by that. They should advise you before you purchase your tickets that the final fight scene, which is the climax of the show, will be presented in low quality from a projector onto the stage. With our tickets at 165 dollars a pop, I expected them to at least put together a replacement scene and give the people their moneys worth! Never again.
Thus show was so beautiful and the people are so talented. I can't believe how brave all these people are, I could never put on a show like that. It was fun although I did watch it by myself.
I actually thought Ka was better than Mystere. Both plots are vague and you really have to watch to follow, but Ka was a bit less vague and actually showed progression through the characters, even if the audience was left to jump a few conclusions. . . There was one part though that was just unbelievably ridiculous. They used some video game looking designs and we were basically watching action on a screen. Um, no. But other than that, some solo/duo scenes were breathtakingly beautiful, which is why I'll fork up two stars.. . Funny though, at the end, when the cast comes out,you'll notice that the majority of them is Asian (we folks are good at acrobatics, I guess?) LOL. . I excitedly paid around $170 for two tickets, with front and center seats, but I will definitely not be back to watch Ka again.
I was actually very disappointed by this show! There was not much in the way of acrobatics and I've seen far better Cirque shows and performances. It was a bummer because our group was really looking forward to it. The most impressive part was easily the stage. Whoever designed that stage is an absolute genius! Other than that though, I'd advise finding a different show.
They screwed up. Had seen the show before the accident happened, but now I came to see it again and they totally ruined it. They've changed almost the entire show with very little acrobatics and nearly no battles. . . Not to mention the final "epic" battle which is now a poor quality video projection. They should have removed the show instead of making it awful. . . Shame on you Cirque, seen many others amazing productions and this one just doesn't deserve anymore to be under the Cirque brand.
So amazing! I had never seen a Las vegas show before so I didnt know what to expect and lets just say that KA went above and beyond my imagination! It tells a story that touches your heart and excites the senses. By the time the show was over most of us were standing and clapping like mad and I'm not ashamed to say I had a tear in my eye. If you can only see one show in Vegas make sure it's KA!! You will NOT be disappointed :-)
This was my second Cirque Du Soleil show that I've watched. I very much enjoyed watching Ka. I did come into this with a bigger expectation only because the first show I've seen was O. O has a much larger stage and audience seating and it was a water show. Ka on the other had is more focused on the choreography of martial arts combined with some aerial stunts However I did not walk out disappointed. The story line of the show is pretty obvious. There was not a single second where I didnt understand. I did read some of the yelp reviews and I still dont understand how some people can miss the storyline. They do have a narrator explaining the two characters in the beginning of the show. . . The stage is small and the audience seating isnt quite large however it plays an advantage to the audience because there really isnt a seat that has bad viewing. We had a seat in the back tier but it was still pretty close to the stage. There is no balcony seating.  . . The production of the show I think did a good job. Switching from one scene to another following the two characters was done gracefully and if you pay attention to the scenes, the softer scenes & the more action packed scenes contrast very well. . . Because the production is smaller, it allowed the actors to interact with the audience. They come off the stage and interact with us which I thought was cool! . The staff that helped us to our seats were organized and in character. . . During the show there was a part where it was all video. It is suppose to be a fighting scene and it is normally performed by the performers. However about a year ago, there was an accident involving one of the performers so now they do that scene using video rather than the actual performers. So hopefully that explains alot before jumping into conclusions saying that it was stupid. (Comments from other yelp review) Other than that, the show overall was good and I personally enjoyed it!
This is a tuff review... The first time seeing the show, before the finale was modified, was an easy 5 stars. It was a favorite of mine that i recommended to everyone! However, the second time, after the finale was modified, the show was missing a major component of its core essence... (Last paragraph is the bottom line). . That is a tuff statement for me to make. I do not want to show a lack of respect to all the performers and the separate elements of the show, and i certainly don't want to show a lack of respect to the deceased performer and her family... But the show just is not the same.. . Awhile back there was an episode of Modern Marvels based on Ka. It was very clear, in the episode, that what set this show apart from the rest was the advanced theatre and stage technology. A significant display of that impressive technology, was the amazing finale. This is literally what  lured me in to see Ka in the first place, and i was not disappointed at all! . . Bottom line: Ka is still a really good show, but it hardly stands up to what it was. If the finale must be modified, then i hope it continues to evolve, because the current version might as well be removed all together.
I saw Ka many years ago, when it first came to the MGM Grand, and I have to say, I hated it that first time. I always considered it one of the worst Cirque shows I had seen.. . After many years of avoiding a return to this show, even though my BF had never seen it, I finally caved in and went to an early showing. Boy, am I glad I did.. . The show, like all Cirque shows, has changed quite a bit, and though there are still parts that leave me wondering WTF (like the digital scenes) the show has improved immensely! . . I found myself thoroughly entertained and entranced by many of the performances. The sheer enormity of the stage, the movement, the coordination involved from performers to lighting to movement. It's awesome!
What a great performance! They must have had to practice a lot to get their acts right. . . Every single act was nicely done. I was so sleepy due to lack of sleep (why sleep when you are in Vegas?) but I was fully awake throughout the show.
Visually stunning! Don't go in thinking you will get a full on acrobatic show. If you look at Ka as a musical of some sort, you will not be disappointed. Music is so beautiful and really deserves a lot of recognition. What a great show!
I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one.
Saw several years ago.. . I thought the show was amazing! Loved how the performers ended up being not just on the stage in front of me but also in the wings to each side and in the back of the theater. . . It is amazing the way they manipulated the actual stage itself. Never seen anything like it. . . Would highly recommend.
