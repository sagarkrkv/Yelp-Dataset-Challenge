SO.. DAMN.. HIP!. . lots of eating disorders wearing stuff from anthropolgie taking themselves too seriously. I enjoy people watching here. Best place to watch public break ups.. . maybe if we all hold our breathe and promise not to move away phoenix will become a real city....
Came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. It was in one word; hip. I had a sazerac and the jalapeno bacon mac'n'cheese both of which were fantastic. The atmosphere is very chill and it was easy to find an area to suit your interests. The service was helpful and friendly and overall was a great experience! Definitely worth checking out if you're anywhere nearby.
Great coffee house. Amazing vibe. Food is really good. Coffee price is a bit high I think 4.20 for a small iced latte but it was worth it. I got the Mac n cheese and it was amazing.
I've been going here for three years now. Great coffee both locally and origin based and roasted onsite. Coffee is fresh, staff are polite and informational when it come to coffee. Atmosphere is alternatively fitting for a relaxing cup of coffee!
Delicious coffee & even better eggs! But ladies, don't even think about showing up without your high waisted shorts, your hair in a messy bun or your nerd glasses. I felt out of place a little bit but the coffee and good made up for it!
Awesome place to get whatever fancy coffee or pastry you'd like! Small breakfast menu makes the choices easy. I've never had lunch or dinner there and to my understanding the menu is always changing. They have a full bar as well! I always get the bacon, egg and cheddar sandwich and it never disappoints. My husband always gets the sweet Dutch pancake with their homemade whipped cream - also very tasty. Prepaid to to be patient as the lines are usually pretty long and seating difficult when it's too hot to sit outside on the patio. Employees are all very friendly. Definite hipster hangout - so be prepared for some interesting conversations and facial hair.
Wow. Went here for the first time this morning and plan on going back next weekend! We ordered two bloody Mary's and two breakfast sandwiches. Watching the bartender fix the bloody Mary's was entertaining and made our mouths water! It was the best Bloody Mary I have ever had! The sandwiches were a great choice as well, simple but tasty. The bill came and it was only $29 which I was shocked by. The bloody Mary's were only $8! The quality and the price can't be beat in the valley!
Lux is the place to go to if you're looking to experience Phoenix. You'll encounter a varied amount of individuals that inhabit the midtown area! All of the food I've had so far is great, although it is a bit on the pricier side. I also suggest pre-planning if you are going to study. The internet isn't the greatest  so download any books or articles you need ahead of time!
Great little hang out spot. Full bar, excellent coffee & tea, and great food. Definitely trendy. Good location, right off the light rail. If you're in the phoenix area and in the mood for something different, it's worth it!
Cool ambiance and the quiche was really good! The coffee cake was a little dry. . . My mom and I went and got 2 quiches, coffee cake and coffee and it was $13. Very reasonable!
A lot of people call this place 'hipster', and I suppose there are a lot of hipsters who love this place. But I am, in no way, a hipster, and I LOVE everything about this place. It is incredibly relaxed and the service is exceptional. Coffee is good, breakfast is good, cocktails are the best in town. Tell them what you like and let them make a custom cocktail for you. It feels like you are drinking cocktails in your living room, if your living room was full of interesting spirits and cordials. You will be surrounded by people from all walks of life and everyone will have a great time.
Very cool place. The service was excellent and everyone was so friendly. Haven't tried the coffee but the wine is amazing! Definitely will be back.
This place is awesome.  I've been here no less than 50 times in the last couple years.  It's great for getting a beer/cocktail, great for dinner, great for lunch, and they have amazing/quick breakfast options.  I sometimes work from here for half a day on the free/fast wifi (there's plenty of power outlets in the back room area.  Highly recommend this place.  Well done, Jeff Fischer!
