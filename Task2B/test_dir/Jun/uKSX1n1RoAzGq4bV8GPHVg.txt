If I were able to eat gluten then it might get more stars.  If it were fall and they had their pumpkin soup on the menu they might get one more too....but here's the thing.  We had about five different people wait on us, and we still aren't sure who our official waiter was.  The five that came did so sporadically and would forget and ask the same questions twice and then when the drinks came, they were adequate.  It was happy hour so that's good but the wait was quite long to receive them and then when asked if I was ready for another and I said yes, he came back again another fifteen minutes later and asked the same question.  Um, yes!. . Rather than have a salad, or pay over $20 for an entree, I opted for the black rice dish. Or "Forbidden Rice Bowl" with supposedly 7 veggies, ginger, garlic and sweet and spicy dressing. The veggies were very al dente.  Asparagus and tomatoes being the shining stars of the dish.........altogether it was ok but not memorable.. . For a drink I had the  Santa Rosa;  finlandia vodka, st. germain, pink grapefruit &basil.  It was good. Not the strongest drink I've had in Mid Town Happy Hour but it was good.. . My friend tried the Mezcal Mule; sombra mezcal, gosling's ginger beer, cucumber, agave &passion fruit........and sent it back as unbearable.  She opted instead for a glass of   Walnut Block Sauvignon Blanc, which she said was divine and a Market Vegetable Flatbread which she said was "okay.". . It took a while to get someone to take our money and overall just not that impressed.  My friend did say it is usually packed during happy hour with much noise due to the hard surfaces everywhere......but this Thursday night it was quite dead which did not help to explain the lack of customer service.. . There are just way too many better places to go than to spend $20 on a broiled chicken dinner or bowl of rice.  Sorry.
I recently went on a date with my husband here. The service and good was awesome. Our waiter, Taylor was on point with all his recommendations. From wine to dessert. The atmosphere was very cool. I'm headed back this weekend. I very much recommend this place.
There is only one thing I keep not likening about one of my favorite local bar/restaurant. The fact that tables are so close to one another, especially outside. . . I understand that restaurant wants to make money, but they are pushing a line with putting people seat so close to each other. . . Every time I go there, I can feel guests next to me breathing on me. Little privacy would not hurt so much...Especially when business is always booming and that extra table will not make a huge difference if it is not there.. . For everything else, I give this place 5 stars...Service, food, drinks, etc....
Popped in here looking for a place to eat after checking it out on Yelp.  I had the cheese flatbread, which I found to be so-so.  I also had to try the fingerling potatoes.. YUM YUM.  The outside was nice and crispy.  Two of us split the small order, which was plenty for us.  She had the eggplant parmesan.  Definitely a different take than the standard Italian where it is soggy and swimming in sauce.  This eggplant was very tasty and had some body to it.  Small dinner salad was also a nice addition.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  We came at an off time, so could see that this place could get packed quickly.  Quirky table set-ups inside and out...
This was an unexpected surprise.  Having been to many similar restaurants I had reserve expectations but after everybody started to dig in we quickly began to offer tastes of our dishes to share the amazing food.
Cute place. Very adorable for date night or out with friends. The food is good.... I tried their chicken salad. Really good. Not a huge fan of their pork sandwich. To me the bread is incredibly tough.
Generally, good restaurant.  However, went in the other day and ordered a vegetable sandwich.  i wanted a little protein to go with the sandwich, however, and my server flat our refused.  He would not even agree to bring out a separate, side of bacon for me to put on the sandwich myself.  This was just plain weird.
A favorite of ours. I always end up getting the salmon, which is consistently delicious. Our waiter was attentive & fun to chat with as the dinner crowd started to thin. My husband had the scallops & said that was delicious as well.. . We didn't mind the close tables - it was an opportunity to meet others. If you're looking for something more intimate, this may not be your number one choice. I'm sure we will continue to return & enjoy.
OMG!!!! We saw this place on diners drive ins and dives. And let me tell you it was amazing I had the egg sandwich with fries that had this AMAZING seasoning on them. My fiance ordered a chicken sandwich with a salad and that was delicious as well. Our waitress was great . They messed up on my fiance's order so they paid for our first round of drinks . We will definitely be going back on our next trip to Arizona !!!!
I really liked St. Francis but going on a sort of holiday (Father's Day), probably made it a little less than a stellar experience for me.. . The wait wasn't too painful..maybe 15 minutes for brunch. We were seated upstairs with our daughter-which kind of stunk. The tables are crammed very close together.. They were out of high chairs, so we ended up using a booster seat; not terrible, but not ideal for a short 2 year old.. .  One very cute thing for kids is the toy box at the entrance. It certainly helped distract our kiddo while we waited for a table-so much so that she wanted to keep going back to it.. . Food was really great-I had the baked tomato egg dish, and my husband had the iron skillet pancake. He liked it, but felt it would be just too rich to get again.. One of those "I gotta try it just once" sort of dishes.. . It took a very long time to place our order, the waiter never came back to check on us, and our drinks were never refreshed.. . This place has a really great patio, and a really cool vibe all around.. . Complimentary valet was also a nice touch since the lot is tiny.. . I'll definitely give it another try.
Came here for brunch with a friend. I didn't have a negative experience at all, just thought the frittata and egg sandwich were ok. Nothing to get excited about. The bacon date scone was delicious. The coffee wasn't hot enough but other than that no complaints. Loved the live jazz and the service was good too. I would definitely go back. . . I would love to see them do bottomless mimosas and Bloody's but they don't. That would be my one suggestion :)
I really liked this place. They have fresh baguette and I had the Forbidden Rice which was great! The menus tell you what's gluten free or dairy free. The servers seem a bit rushed but it's good other than that.
Wow has this place come into its own in the past 4-5 years. . I came here a few times for happy hour when it first opened and enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink specials but wasn't bowled over by the menu. . Funnily enough, it was an episode of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives (I know, I hate that guy too, but it's how I get my American food fix in London) that introduced me to what I would later become obsessed with: that cast iron, wood fired pancake.. When it came time to plan my next visit home, I put that shit in my itinerary: Friday, visit grandma and lunch with dad; Saturday, cast iron pancake @St Francis. That's how serious I was about this pancake.. Finally, the glorious day came and we arrived at opening time for Saturday brunch (sneaked past the valet who weren't quite set up yet and parked right out front, too!). Settled on the lovely covered patio with it's grape leaves that let just the right amount of sunshine flow through and got to business.. Bloody mary ($9 ... ouch), biscuits and gravy ($12) and announced to my friends we'd be splitting the pancake for dessert (I needed my biscuit fix, too!) Fellow diners got the egg sandwich ($10 and one of the cheapest option on the breakfast menu) and the eggs benedict ($13).. It took forever for our order to come out. I had to order another bloody mary (considering the price, it was not an easy decision to make), but the air was fine and we had no where to be. Finally, it arrived and was so, so happy. Dreams = fulfilled.. The bill came to a whopping 72 (not including tip!) and they could have been a bit more apologetic about the wait and more upfront with updates from the kitchen, but I'll forgive them because PANCAKE.
The "Pig Dip" is a work of art - and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had... with wood-roasted pork loin, prosciutto, bacon, fennel onion marmalade, dijon, and gruyere on a perfectly wood-fire toasted house baguette. The white fish was cooked perfectly over an olive and mint cous cous. Run don't walk to St. Francis - including for breakfast. Haven't tried the special salmon yet but everything else so far has been amazing.
