Located in the bellagio casino. Went to the 10pm show and it lasted at little over 1hr 30 min for the event. Price for me ordered through they're website was 130 per person. There is some higher prices and lower prices if need be...I took best available at the time of ordering. There is no bad seat in the place even in the far back you can see the show with no problems. I like the event very much for a Circe show. The talent is very good. I would say its and must see show. A++
I saw this specatacular show last night, i would trully reccomened it to anyone, but the only thing i would give a heads up to would be to take a nice coat, because it is insanely cold in there!
Amazing!! What they say about this show is really true! The acrobatics are phenomenal but the set design including the unbelievable pool that basically appears and disappears is like living in a fantasy world. The costumes provide even more visual interest and the music is live and keeps your attention throughout the show. It may seem expensive for a 90 minute show, but the work, talent, and artistry that goes into every second of the performance is worth every penny. We booked the day of the show (on a Wed.) and we got 15% off at the box office for tickets in the front orchestra.
This was incredible!. . Tickets were a bit pricey, but my fiancee and I went to the Bilagio  and found the ticket desk. They gave us an additional 15% off of our ticket if we chose the evening show (I'm guessing they were trying to fill up the arena), so our tickets were roughly $135 each, but it was worth every penny.. . When the show starts they do a fantastic job of getting you involved in the performance (not physically, of course), but you find yourself lost in the show. There's so much going on at one time, sometimes it's hard to see everything, but it's so beautiful and the acrobatics were incredible!. . If you could see only one show in Vegas, I'd absolutely recommend "O"!
Not only was the show stunning, the ushers were great too. When one of them saw my vertically-challenged gf straining to see over the railing, she came over to us and said, "hang on, honey, I'm gonna get you a cushion." She quickly returned with a comfy looking booster seat. That's some proactive, friendly service! . . The show itself was fantastic. It's hard to find cheap tickets to this one for a reason. It was the most impressive cirque show I've seen so far, and didn't have any obnoxious gay jokes like some of their other shows.
THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!. . The tickets are a pricey for sure.. made me think whether it was necessary.. but lemme tell u that it was worth every cent! . . The show is around for two hours, so you may wanna hit the restrooms before..and if you aren't well rested you might feel its a little slow..but i'm glad i wasn't in any of the former situations so i actually got to enjoy every moment of it..( wouldn't say the same for my husband though)... . Such amazing acrobatics seen.. and the risk taken would make your heart skip a beat... Try not missing out any, as there were lots of sequences.. all happening at the same time on different parts of the stage..its a little hard to keep up most of the times... . Oh ..and the music..it was not until the last we noticed the music was live too.. really thought it was some prerecorded tape. .. . So if you aren't in Vegas for much longer, and you really wanna sit and relax for one evening rather than shopping or walking through the casinos.. i would ask you to see the show once.. . . #DontMissOut #WorthIt
This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and I was impressed by the performance overall. There were some crazy acrobatic moves going down that left me in awe. We got amazing center, 4th row seats using our M-Life card discount!. . The only thing I didn't like about this performance was the lack of storyline, and sometimes it seemed like too much random stuff was going on. But it is a circus show, after all!. . I do recommend people to watch this. It's something entertaining, different, and this really encouraged me to watch the rest of the Cirque du Soleil shows.
This is the best Cirque show I have seen.  From the set to the performers, it is one of the best ever.  The water effects are tremendous.  Don't go anywhere else until you have seen this and la reve.  Skip the Beatles until you go here.  You won't be disappointed.
This is my second Cirque du Soleil show and I loved it. Although I didn't fully understand the story plot, I was just fully immersed in all the acrobatics and water action.. . The prices do seem a bit pricey, but you can always do some search online and find random deals for as much as 20% off. So this does help a bit.. . Also, there is no intermission and it's a full 1.5 hours so plan on not going to the bathroom or anything until after the show.. . Some of the "fillers" just didn't fit at all into the whole O experience, but I guess they have to do what they need to do, to get the real acrobats where they need to be. But at least the fillers didn't take up too much time and did not distract you from the main show.. . Overall, it was a great experience. I would definitely do this again after I see a few more other Cirque shows just for comparison.. . Again, go search for some discounts online!!!
Beautiful chaos!   It was spectacular. There were a couple moments where I felt there was too much going on because I couldn't look at everything.  We had great seats. Section 102, row N, seats 14 & 15.  The stunts, acribats, costumes, music, it's all wonderful!   Getting the audience involved, runnning through the audience,  and swinging into the audience. Just a breathtaking performance by all.  The amount of work that goes in backstage, and under water in this case, must be amazing.  Looks like a great group of people working here. The show is almost two hours but seems like only a few minutes. You are mesmerized the entire time. There are floor changes before you even know what's happening. Characters pop up out of nowhere. My favorite may have been the diving group. It was fun, upbeat, and daring. I think there is probably a uniqueness to each time this show is performed. I would love to see it again and catch the differences. A must see at some point while coming to Vegas.  A tip:  get seats more towards the middle. If you go too far to the sides you don't get to see it in its entirety. If you go too far up you lose details (and there's tons).  If you go too far down you may get wet!  We paid in the 180 each range but it was worth it.
I will never forget the first time I went to a Cirque show. It was way back in the early 90s when most people (at least in the U.S.) had never heard of the troupe - including me. I was visiting a friend inNYC and her dad gave us tickets. When I looked at them I thought $120 was an awful lot of moola for a silly circus. As I approached the Big Top in Battery Park I began to understand something was different. I think the show was Quidam (or maybe Alegria). I left memorized and with a bagful of expensive Cirque merch as I was certain I would never see anything as amazing again. . . Now, after having seen countless Cirque shows (both touring and those permanently housed in Las Vegas) I can say that "O" is definitely one of the top 3 Cirque shows ever!. . It's hard to believe that Cirque could outdo itself in terms of creativity; however, they succeeded with "O." So much so that I have now seen it twice and was even more impressed the second time around. . . "O" is Cirque meets Water Ballet. I can't think of any other way to describe it. Amazing acrobatics, beautiful costumes and body paint, diving extravaganza....overall surreal serenity. Think vivid imagery similar to those in the film "What Dreams May Come." Just doesn't seem real...more like a splendid dream. . . The theater inside the Bellagio was custom built to accommodate this very special show. The performers utilize this "circular" theater by performing on the "stage," as well as the rest of the house (keep your eyes open up and down the isles). Somewhat interactive. On both occasions, my husband and I purchased tickets in section 102 in the "wet zone." Fantastic seats and only a few small splashes of water here and there. No worries. And, if you want to spend a little less money, I can't imagine there being a bad seat in the house. JOUIR!
Beautifully done, the water effect can make you sleepy! So be sure to rest prior to arrival. Balcony seats are nice but you lose the effect of the show seeing the "behind the scenes" of the water underneath. A magnificent show that combines Cirque Du Soleil with water in ways that seem unimaginable.
Although it would be cool to sit in the "water" section my husband and I sat in the balcony which is a must for this show. You can clearly see all the water acts from above, which made this experience even better then if we were to sit in the front row. Great acrobatics and amazing visually. Can't wait to see another.
How can you give this show less than 5 stars?  Perhaps I'm just easily amused, but I loved everything about the show from the way they opened the curtain, to the way they closed the curtain.  The price of the tickets compared to other shows, combined with the fact that it seems to be sold out quite often, suggests I'm not the only one who loves the show.  I hear that some people don't like chocolate though, so I guess everyone has different tastes.. . My wife and I had seats that were in the front row in the very corner, so we missed a bit of the show before they opened the curtain because our view was blocked.  I was a bit annoyed at first, but quickly became involved in the rest of the show and the 2 minutes I couldn't see didn't really amount to much.  . . I think the location of our seats in the first row really emphasized how high the aerial performers were and possibly made the stage seem that much more impressive.. . I found every bit of the show to be "world class" as another reviewer said, and since learning that the music was performed live, I am once again blown away as their performance was flawless to my ears.  Because of our location in the theater we could not see the musicians.. . Even after spending several hours on planes earlier in the day, and waking up at midnight Las Vegas time that day (meaning we had been awake for approximately 19 and a half hours when the show started) we were not lulled to sleep as other reviewers were.. . The tickets may be pricey for some, and the $108 we paid for each ticket is not small change to me.  It was worth every penny.  In a town where you can spend hundreds on dinner or a couple of hours gaming, it seems like a downright good valu.  So, eat at McDonalds, stay away from the slots for an hour, do whatever you have to do to see "O."  It will be much more memorable than the steak you skipped to see it.
This is the 3rd time I've seen this show and I literally cry when it ends. . . There is no real theme, and like most circus acts, there is a lot going on. The music, the theatrics w the water and the cast all have this chemistry that practically hypnotizes the audience and raises this show over the other Cirque du Soleil shows.  It's beautifully choreographed. . . Even with this being my 3rd time seeing, the show is always fresh with something new to see. If this show ever closes in Las Vegas, I'm afraid I won't have another reason to return. . . This show deserves 10 stars!
This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show so I didn't know what to expect or how to compare it to the other shows, but it was AMAZING!! Since then I've also seen Le Reve and don't think it's as good as O.. . This show is very acrobatics focused. There is no story but every scene is is like a tiny story, if you will. I really liked the live singers in the booth on the right side of the stage, and the clown scenes were pretty funny too.. . Some parts of the show were kind of creepy/weird but still very cool; like one of those real circuses. There was always so much going on I wish I could watch everything at once, but there are just too many people doing too many different things at once. I guess it is part of the overall effect, though.. . There are a couple of surprising scenes involving "audience interactions", but I won't spoil it for you. The way they open and close the curtains was very innovative and unexpected and fit very well with the whole show. . . Overall I would definitely come again!! So worth the money!. . TIP: find seats near the middle/upper sections. You'll be able to see everything going on on stage and won't have to crane your neck to see the first performer descend from the ceiling!
