This is a free and beautiful sight to see during the day, but an amazing place to stop by at night.  I can imagine many night time proposals in front of this fountain.  This is a do-not-miss -in-Vegas.
This is easily the best free show anywhere.  You don't get much for free in Vegas these days, so it is worth the effort.  Thank you Steve Wynn for your vision and for sharing this with us poor folks.
It's a bit difficult to review this Las Vegas icon because it not only defines the Bellagio Hotel but also The Strip itself, and in a way, the entire city of Las Vegas as the world knows it.  So this review can really only make sense when compared with other cool things to see and watch in Vegas, and their relative "wow factor".. . Watching the Fountains used to be quite a cool spectacle, no matter how many times I've seen them dance. However, on my most recent trip this past week, I noticed that they have turned the volume of the music down significantly, so much so that you can only really hear it very faintly when you are standing right next to the fountain.  Before, the effect of the Fountains used to be really cool because of how loud and deliberately synchronized the music was to the lights and the water jets... But now, it really looks more like a light and water show with music as an afterthought. . . Maybe the neighboring hotels complained about the noise? Not sure, but I sure do miss how loud the music before.
The fountains at the Bellagio are remarkable. They are a must see for anyone who is visiting Las Vegas. The water to the music to the colors are amazing! Anywhere you stand you have a great view and the kids love it.
One of the shining stars in Vegas. To me, these fountains mark the very center of downtown Vegas. They're the 'Central Park' of Vegas.
My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p. . The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  . http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/. . Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!. . Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  . . You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.. . Highly recommmend!
This show was so cool to see at night!!!. The water is almost like fireworks...especially with the all the water lit up with the lights. I also like how the water is synchronized with the background music :) I would totally want to see this show again next time I come!
FREE ENTERTAINMENT!!! Probably the best free nighttime (and daytime) entertainment for tourists. My best friend recently visited and she LOVED the nighttime show -- within an hour we got a great range from the following songs: Elton John, Simple Gifts, The Pink Panther, etc. They're really good at changing it up and of course, the water and patterns move differently according to song.. . Showtimes every 15 minutes. Best views: right in front of them (at the Bellagio), Mon Ami Gabi (restaurant at Paris Hotel), or outside at the Sugar Factory (Paris Hotel). Decent view from the porch at the Sugar Factory store. . . When you come to Vegas, you've got to see this at night -- I mean, it's when Clooney's character in Ocean's had an epiphany. Everyone's gotta have an Ocean's moment in Vegas.
First, some show times and some tips and then I will attempt to be humorous with my review:. . FOUNTAIN SHOW TIMES:. Monday - Friday:. 3pm - 7pm (Every Half Hour....so 3pm, 3:30pm, 4pm, etc.). THEN. 7pm - 12am (Every 15 Minutes...so 7pm, 7:15pm, 7:30pm, etc.). . Saturdays/Holidays:. 12pm - 7pm (Every Half Hour). 7pm - 12am (Every 15 Minutes). . Sundays:. 11am (Every 15 minutes for the Jasmine Sunday Brunch). THEN it follows the Saturday/Holiday Schedule at 12pm. . TIPS:. 1) Stay away from the rapper guys trying to give you one of their CDs with all of their "slammin hits."  This is a scam.  Do not even touch the CD.  Once you grab the CD they then say you bought it and it costs $5.  They are pushy and intimidating to tourists that do not know better.  Just keep walking.  You do not have to be polite to these people....they are scam artists.  They notoriously hide out near the fountains and on some of the catwalks near the fountains.  Just keep walking.. 2) If you want to get a good spot for the show then travel during one of the 15 minute span time frames.  Arrive right before the fountain show ends and wait for everybody to leave then grab the best location to watch the next show.  You will wait for 20-30 minutes in total, but it will be worth it.. . REVIEW:. The show is great.  You can see it all over the strip, but nothing is better than seeing it up close and personal.  There are tons of characters asking for tips with you taking a picture etc.  Be sure to look at the dirty looking Dora.  There is some lady there dressed as Dora and she looks as though she just walked through the desert and decided to make a few bucks at the Bellagio fountains before once again venturing out into the desert....like a weird Vegas Punxsutawney Phil.. . I don't want to sound like a big wuss, but the best song for that fountain show is "Time to Say Goodbye."  Look it up on youtube....it gives me chills, but I have to act tough since my fiance is usually right next to me.  Yeah....I act tough as I accompany her to the Prada store to go bag shopping..... . Kneel before my toughness!!!!. . Seriously though....awesome show.  Do not miss it.  And remember my tips.
Most beautiful fountains I have seen, night show is great, lighting, atmosphere. Def. worth seeing.
Love this place. It's always a nice way to start or end your trip in Vegas. After a crazy weekend for EDC, my fiancee and I just skipped out on the third day of EDC and watched the fountains on our last night in Vegas. It was a nice calm, classy way to end the vacation. Shows are every 15 minutes or so if you are around during the summer at night. Worth watching if you've never seen them before!
The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.. The show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.. I like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.. Great photo ops, not to be missed!
An amazing experience! Free to boot!. . I think they only go in the evening. There are signs posted about when they start/when next one is.. . I have been to Vegas multiple times and always stop to watch the Bellagio fountains. . . The choreography of the fountains to the music is just magical. . . Worth waiting and getting a close spot for.
