I really can't complain since we got an excellent bargain off of hotwire ($31/night), but if I had to pay the original prices based off of the hotels website, I think my review would be much more critical. The hotel lobby and casino are nicely kept, a bit smokey but what Las Vegas hotel isn't. The room size itself was adequate and the bed was comfy.  Very simple, no coffeemaker or refrigerator in the room.  The walls needed a bit of repair, some faded wall spots were very apparent and our bathroom door would not close.  Called maintanence but they did not show up the whole weekend we were there to fix it.  I would rate this hotel a 3/5 and would say it's more of a 3 star than 4 star.  Would stay again if I receieved the same deal.  I would also ask to stay in the Paradise Tower because it's closer to main entrance.  The Club Tower is quite a walk. Lastly, this hotel is one of the south end hotels and adjacent from the MGM.  It is a bit far from the middle of Las Vegas BLVD where all the action is.
My parents who frequent Vegas told us the Tropicana was one of their favorite places to gamble while there so my sisters and I made sure to check it out while on our family trip. Although we did not personally stay there, we did walk over to gamble one night. The dealers attitudes were very off-putting and one of them even rolled her eyes as we put money on the table. We figured that since the crowd in there was a little older they probably didn't want us walking in with our yardstick margaritas and livening the place up a bit. But honestly we were not loud, intoxicated, or distracting in any way and we felt we were treated very rudely and stereotypical. We all lost money and the energy was extremely negative. I will never go there to gamble again. At least not until i'm 50 and i'll be treated mire respectfully i guess.
This place sucks. It took us 3 hours to check into our room. And the dealers were rude and disrespectful. A dealer named KT and some lady dealer was rude to me and telling me to back away from the table that my friends were playing at 5 in the morning. First of all, you took forever to prepare our room when it should have been done at 2 pm when we checked in at 6 pm and then you are going to tell me to back away from my friends playing blackjack. Absolutely ridiculous, this hotel sucks. I would rather spend way more money for a decent hotel then this crap of a hotel. Tropicana sucks! Worst hotel on the strip.
I thought the Trop was great.  The price is on the low end of the spectrum for the Vegas strip, but I thought the room was comfy and pretty nice.  Definitely a step up from the cheap ass Excalibur across the street.  Hilton runs it, and I find that they have a certain standard of quality that holds up.. . The casino is pretty paltry for gambling types, but the location is centrally located near NY/NY, MGM and the Luxor.. . The pool area is awesome.. . My biggest complaint is that the shutters in the room don't completely block out the light, so if you've been partying all night, it might be a little more difficult to get some shuteye.
Sure, it's ok (at best) until you have a problem. The casino is decent, although quite small with not a lot of table games. However, should something bad happen, for example, housekeeping walks off with a couple of dresses, don't expect management to be of much help. When a couple items went missing from our room on a Friday, we were told that we'd "have to wait until Monday for Risk Management to review the claim", instead of getting actual help in trying to track down those items.. . I also realize that this next complaint is probably a common practice, but it's still an unethical one: Be prepared to have a $20 "resort fee" tacked on in addition to what you've already paid when you reserve the room.. --------------------------------. Follow-up: The dresses were found. In the Housekeeping Supervisor's office. After 2 days of me trying to get them to track them down.
The new Tropicana is nice. There are still issues that they need to iron out.. . The new lobby is beautiful and not as kitschy. The lobby is beautiful and white and polished. The previous Tropicana was filled with dust and plastic plants the last time i visited. . . I made reservations for this hotel room for the Future insights conference. Rooms were set at a group rate at $75 per night; making it more reasonable.. . Also, this Tropicana will charge you 19.99 resort fee for the pool, the gym, etc.. . The pool is very nice and beautiful. It's a little dirty.. . The gym is so super tiny and small. It sits on top of the pool area. The gym doesn't have any A/c so making it very uncomfortable to work out. The largest weight here is 45 pounds.. . The reservation desk is a bit on the slow side. Be sure to have your Hilton water number to get ahead of the line. . . If you need to get cheap breakfast the Starbucks near the middle of the hotel lobby is your best bet. They offer microwaved sandwiches. The other restaurant options for breakfast are more expensive.. . Overall, i'd give it a 3.5. I decided to round up because i paid 75 per night.
I had a good experience here at the Trop. We had a super early flight and arrived on a Thursday morning around 7AM. Went to the front registration desk and asked if we can check in early and at the same time upgraded from club tower deluxe to the paradise tower deluxe for $10 extra per night. The lady working at that time was nice enough to take the request and said she would call us if anything opens up before our actual check in time at 2PM. We killed a few hours by getting breakfast and taking a nap by the pool side, which was quite nice. Around 12PM we got a call saying that our room was ready. No complains about the room(926) except that the shower head was a little loose and the tub had a few chips and nicks. My favorite part of the room was the bed, which was nice, big, and comfy. It was much needed for a long trip in Vegas. On the last day we called in the morning of asking to check out an hour later without additional charge. Finally, I was clumsy enough before heading to the airport to leave my wallet on one of the slot machines. I thought I was totally screwed until I went to the lost and found and one of the workers picked it up before anyone else could!!!
Room service disgusting... Never staying here again no robes no fridge and I deff over paid
We weren't too impressed with the  'newly remodeled rooms'. We enjoy the one in Laughlin do wanted to check this one out. They didn't let us know that they are affiliated with a large chain. ( hilton I think ) and then wouldn't giveus the points after we had left. Rooms far in the back and not the best food options. Prices for rooms are pretty high for what you get.
I've come here for years.  It has changed a ton, and for the better.  There is still room for improvement in the rooms, like a fridge, and larger showers.  But overall this place has a resort vibe that I like.  Just enough black jack tables to not be completely overcrowded and the restaurants have all had great food.  Definitely not the new fast paced club scene you get everywhere else,  but not the run down hotel it once was. We'll be back.
I love this hotel. My husband and I stayed here on out honeymoon. We went right after the wedding so i was dressed up and so was he. the check in was very fast and the staff was super friendly. when they saw us dressed up they were super nice and they upgraded our room and gave us a suite. AND they gave us a $50 credit and we got room service with that. that was sooo nice of them. one bad thing is that the rooms are all the way at the back of the casino so u have to walk a lot to get to the room. i think that's it though because the rooms are super clean and they have fast service. they help a lot and most of the rooms are new. the pool and Jacuzzi was amazing. i loved this hotel and i had a great honeymoon thanks to them :D
Kirk's hotel lives on! Kirk has long roots inVegas. Read about Kirk Kerkorkian, a wonderful man. His name comes up sometimes with Meyer  Lansky. Anyway, I booked 4 nights at a bargain. You will not find these amenities on the strip that is  this affordable. The hotel is very generous for people on a limited budget. The hotel is very well managed. I appreciate the resourceful renovation which recycled the old hotel. Alot of these big corporations are bulldozer happy and waste valuable resources. I'm not a gambler either, Mr Lansky told us kids never to gamble....
