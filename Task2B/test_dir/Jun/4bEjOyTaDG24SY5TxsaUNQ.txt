The food I had here was absolutely delicious. Lemon skinny pancake and quiche Lorraine. I expected the quiche to be either a slice or a small whole quiche but it was quite large and came with a lovely little green salad. . . We sat on the indoor patio and didn't have to wait at all on Sunday at 10:30. The service was nice (though a bit slow) and so was the view.
The prices are good, oysters are fabulous, and they are EXTREMELY gluten-friendly.  They even give you gluten free bread while you wait for your meal.  Fries, steaks, seems like everything on the menu either is gluten free or can be made gluten free.  Even the ketchup.  I ordered a steak and it was absolutely mouth-watering.  I am planning on flying back up here JUST for dinner. Service was outstanding as well!
This place is a great location with a nice patio. The food is great quality for a good price. We went there for lunch and had the mushroom soup and baked brie for starters that were both outstanding. . . I had the quiche lorraine as my main course. It wasn't my favorite but still good quality. If I were to go again I would likely order a crepe as that looked very good, especially the seafood crepe my dad ordered had a large portion of seafood with it and looked great.
Tried this restaurant for the first time. Service was okay although we did get a little attitude from the hostess who seated us when we did not like the location she led us to.  She then asked if we had a reservation and we said no.  She then proceeded to guide is to a different table which we liked. Food was okay, nothing too special. I ordered a summer tomato salad which never came. I had the classique steak which was delicious and prepared to my liking. We also started with the chicken liver mousse pate which was also delicous. My partner ordered the beef wellington which had to be sent back because he asked for it to be cooked to medium and it was still red so he sent it back. It came out again to his satisfaction. All in all for me it was a been there done that experience.
This place is great.  I've been several times.  It's relatively expensive.  If you are visiting Las Vegas then you should definitely plan on making reservations and sitting on the patio to watch the tourists and if timed correctly, the Bellagio waterfall.  If you do not have reservations, you could be waiting a long time, however I never have waited more than 10 min.. . I highly recommend the seafood tower.  I cannot recommend the lamb shank.  . . So make a big deal of it and get a bottle of champagne and live it up cause Mon Ami Gabi is really one of those Vegas things that all must do.
All I can say is this...if I was sitting at one of the amazing dinner tables outside and given the choice to either watch the stunningly beautiful water show across the street from Mon Ami Gabi OR close my eyes and eat, I would without hesitation close my eyes and eat. I look forward to the next time I get to go!
I'm giving this place 4 stars only because of the goat cheese dip! It was sooo amazing and it might be the only dish and reason why I'd even think about coming back.. . Hyped up spot so my friends and I decided to come. We ordered .... the trout, daily special lamb burger stuffed with bleu cheese, seafood crepe, lobster roll, onion soup and of course the goat cheese dip.. . Aside from the goat cheese dip everything else was average and not really much to rave about. . . The lamb burger had an over easy egg added to it. But to stick my fork into the yolk only to realize it was overcooked was so disappointing! How can you mess up on the egg thooo!?
This is a unique place with the craziest atmosphere I've ever been in. Located across the street from the Bellagio with great fountain view. . . As we came in to this place with reservations, the line was half a mile long. After a short wait at the bar, we got seated. We start with a disappointing Bordeaux and really good bread. Next the country pate' and the chicken liver mousse pate. The chicken liver pate' was the best I have ever had. . . Now- this is the rub, while trying to enjoy a really good French meal....then what seems to be a trailer park bomb exploded and hordes of spandex clothed mutants rushing through-out the place kicking my chair and stumbling through the place. It's really appalling to try to enjoy good food and see so many rude people. You really can't buy class! What an unpleasant site. These people must not own mirrors! We suffered through the rest of the meal adding French Onion Soup & Grilled Trout that was delicious. . . This Resturant is obviously about the volume without a mutant crowd management plan. It's a shame, this could be a great place.
Went here many years ago, sat outside.  Ordered the flank steak with shoe string fries and it was very good.  The people watching and the bellagio fountains across the street make this a wonderful venue.  Pretty good food for a gimmick restaurant, most tourist restaurants are usually under par in the food department.  Would recommend.  A bit pricey, but expected given the location.
This place is absolutely delicious!!. I wanted to take my parents somewhere nice while we were on vacation and Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint! Our entire dinner conversation consisted solely of mmmm's, omg's and "you have to try this!" I still think about the steaks and mashed potatoes! My mom was even impressed at how their salad was the best dressed salad she has ever had! This was a wonderful dining experience, and I will certainty return and recommend it to all!
God, I love this place. They do no wrong in my eyes. We eat here at least once every time we come to Vegas and I am never disappointed. They go out of their way to offer many gluten free options and even bring out freshly toasted GF bread and butter to your table. The waitstaff is always really friendly, you get seated quickly and the outside patio is the best. . . Given the price, location, quality of the food and service this place will always be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Definitely go if you get the chance. You can't go wrong with the steak, salmon or chicken - all fantastic!
Excellent service!  We went for dinner last week on a Wednesday evening during our Vegas vacay.  Were told it would be a 45 min wait for two for a table on the patio, but after only 15 min we were seated.  The view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was perfect with our meals.  I had scallops and hubby had roasted chicken.  Both entrees were very good.  Since we were too full from the delicious starter bread, we couldn't try their desserts.  We chose this place with the help of Yelp and were not dissatisfied.
As a Las Vegas resident i was lucky enough to eat here a dozen times. Ive taken few dates here and even took my mom for mothers day. Food is always delicious service is quick and pleasant. Prices are just right for gourmet food (especially during happy hour)! I always get patio table because i can watch the fountain show. Defiantly would rate it as one of my top choices for eating out with style. I recommend this pace to everyone including YOU!
AMAZING!! And one of the first place on the strip that fully accommodates gluten free! First the bring out GF bread (which is amazing in itself, one of the best gf breads i have ever tasted) then they have a separate menu that has a good range of options and even 3 gf desserts! They even mark the meals with a allergy toothpick. I had the skate meal and was delicious...mum . . Try get in early for a seat outside, it's truly worth it, aview of the Bellagio fountain at night is beautiful. . . Our waiter was Jonathan and he was beyond amazing, he made the experience so much more enjoyable, we was very knowledgable about everything on the menu. And was patient with us as we took a lot of time to decided! . . Great good for a great price! Would go back in a heartbeat and would recommend it to everyone!
Our favorite place to eat!  Breakfast, brunch or dinner!  Best view on the strip and you will be facing the Bellagio fountain show AND be underneath the "Eiffel" Tower.  You have to try their fresh oysters ( I don't usually like fresh oysters, but these were amazing).  Waiters are super good about trying to accommodate your food.  We are trying to go low carb, and they helped keep us on our diet.
This is my second time coming here. My first experience was good and everything was yummy, though I came for brunch so maybe its different. This time I came with my family for dinner and the food was mediocre but what really got me was the service, or should I say the server. I felt like she stereotyped us from the moment we sat down. She came by and took our orders, afterwards she never really returned to check up on us. We asked for medium +1 but we received a rare steak, we had to flag her down to get it corrected. At the end of the meal she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything but rather just dropped off the check and told us gratuity was already included. I guess for a party of 5 they include gratuity already. I was over this place by then, so we just paid the bill and left. I won't be coming back anymore.
The food was delicioussssss!!!! We had a late breakfast and the service was a little slow but the food made up for it!
Came here for lunch on a Thursday. Left tipsy but unimpressed.. . Service was nice and efficient, and we were seated on the patio overlooking the strip pedestrians. We ordered a few dishes to share--the salmon tartare and the steak au pouvre. Also got a carafe of the frangria since I can't resist anything with rosemary in it. . . The warm bread and salmon tartare with homemade potato chips were probably the highlight of the meal. Although that pickled thing that looks like a miniature watermelon with a long stem and lots of seeds was nasty! What is that thing!? Why do restaurants serve these little devils mixed in with the delicious cornichons?? Gross.. . The frangria, sadly, left a bit to be desired. Although it was not sickeningly sweet like some sangrias, it also didn't have the depth of flavors that the description led me to believe it would have. I couldn't taste the fruits and definitely could not taste the rosemary--which made me very sad. . . The steak was also just okay. The cut was so thin that even though we ordered medium rare the only part of the steak that was pink was a 1cm slice toward the middle. I like my steaks juicy and flavorful, and this place, despite all the hype about the steaks, fell short of that cut. . . Overall it was still a pleasant experience and sitting on the patio watching Vegas life was fun. Just don't expect the best steak of your life, and don't eat those picked-mini-watermelon-w/stems.
Ambiance:. For patio seating there was no wait before 7pm and we ate here on a Saturday summer night. If you want to impress this is the place to take them. Not only you get the view of the fountain but you get to people watch. . . Food:. Highly recommend the Goat cheese like previous yelps said along with the smoke salmon for appetizers.. . The steak was average but the French fries were good.. . We did not try any beverages because of all the fat Tuesdays drinks... Overall the food and the environment along with the service was awesome if your on a budget you can settle with the appetizers.  I plan to return again. Thanks yelpers
My take on this place is it generally draws crowd due its perfect location right on the heart of strip. There is nothing out of the ordinary about the food. Although I have to give a lot of credit to our server for trying absolutely hard to accomodate us despite of the big crowd. Came on a Saturday night with friends so obviously having reservation helped. They serve complimentary bread and butter and some kind of salad that I can't exactly remember the ingredients. The serving size was surprisingly bigger than I expected. I had the chicken grandmere with side of mashed potatoes. It was plain roasted chicken, thought it was pretty tasty but a little dry for my tastebuds. My friends devoured the filet mignon, oysters and bone-in ribeye and they seemed to enjoy it. I also had their onion soup with cheese, which I thought was very unique and tasty. For a group of 6, we spent a little over $200. We enjoyed our dinner for the most part.
Some long-time friends brought us here for brunch after having raved about it for months, so we certainly had high expectations, and they were definitely met.. . Aside from the fact that you have to walk into the Paris to get there, the restaurant is delightfully French-y and the service is excellent. The restaurant was super busy that Saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.. . I had a wonderful quiche Lorraine, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. A tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.. . The only downside was the overall price of the menu. I get that it's Las Vegas and it's on the Strip, but we had just come Le Diplomate in Washington, DC, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with LV's Strip prices. But hey, it's still cheaper than the flight to France!
Always great! On my top 5 in the world list!!
The only reason this is not a 5 star is the prices.  Very expensive for breakfast but it was very good. So good we went twice this stay. Service excellent. Seated right away. Served immediately and food was out promptly. Sat outside sling the railing on the street side.  Great location.
love this place, good food and nice view
Had a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones.  Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.  This will be one of the best French meals you'll ever have.
Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever. Mon Ami Gabi=not such a good night. How do you say hell night in French? Enfer nuit? . . I think a name change is in order. Oh, and your staff is very French too. In attitude.
Love this l place! we had the seafood platter, salad and escargo (excuse my spelling) it was just delicious! When I go places one thing I look for in a place is service and he was an absolute delight I would definitely go back if I lived in Vegas.
This last trip to Vegas I really wanted to eat at Mon Ami Gabi. Everyone I talked to raved about this place. If you comehere early you can get a table outside. Outside is where it's at! You get a nice scenic view of the fountain show at the Bellagio. It's all very romantic.. . The complimentary baguette is yummy! Our waiter was nice and helpful. The food is really delicious. We ordered the Prime Steak Sandwich and the Lobster Roll. Mmmm so good! I would love to come here again but for dinner to try their steak and the scallops. Maybe even get dessert! . . Their pommes frites are cute and a must try.
Sit out in the patio for the amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip. Anything you eat you will love.
Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, located in Paris, in the heart of the strip with easy access to the street. staff was very friendly and professional. Went their for Steak dinner which was cooked to perfection and as requested even though our table was huge with 15 people plus. All food came at the same time with the proper temperature. Waiter was attentive and courteous. Again, we hit Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast the next morning, as you know breakfast is very important in Vegas, and this venue is known to be the place for good breakfast and sure it was. Their breakfast menu is extensive with great diverse options. Had a great overall experience and will be looking forward to the next visit soon. The deserve every star.
I ate here for breakfast two days in a row. The food was delicious, and they have gluten free options! The staff was knowledgable on how to handle my meal, and served mine differently than everyone else's. The staff was so wonderful - so friendly, helpful and pleasant. Both our waiters on each day were so cheerful and helpful! We sat outside one of the days. In the Vegas heat it was still cool with the shade.
Best nice dinner deal in Vegas! Yummy, affordable, and with great portions.
Had a great dinner here with friends on Tuesday night. Loved the goat cheese and tomato sauce with baguette - simple and delicious. Hubby had the seafood platter which was very good. I had the sea bass and my girlfriend had the salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. The service was great, and the vibe on the patio brought it all together. I only wish we could have tried dessert but we had a show to get to...next time! :)
I've tried most of the high-end steakhouses in town and Mon Ami Gabi has best steaks in town.
Good food, decent prices for LV. Love the atmosphere and the service -- great job Mon Ami Gabi!
Almost 4k reviews with an average of 4 stars?!! I was excited to try a few dishes here to say the least. We ordered Smoke salmon egg Benedict, blueberry pancakes and cheese omelet, everything was OK but not what I was expecting from a 4k reviews, 4 stars restaurant. . . I had smoked salmon Benedict which was a little too runny for my taste, salmon was too little and hollandaise sauce was almost non existent. Not sure if I'll give it another shot.
The food isn't terrible, but it is seriously mediocre. The gimmick here are the steak-frites which were nothing special and severely overpriced. The prices for the other cuts of steak are more reasonable. Tables are rushed to be turned quickly, wine selection is poor for being the purported best French restaurant in Vegas, and the atmosphere is very loud. Credit where it is due, the chilled seafood platter and desserts we had were very nice.
I ate here a couple of times for breakfast on vacation and really liked  it both times. The interior is a lot like  an off-the-center of the city Parisian bistro. I have no way of knowing that, of course, since I've never been to France, but trust me. I'm right on the money with this. It's got a really nice inside part. And the outside part is awfully nice if it's not 110 degrees out. . .     The food is exceptional and reasonable for the Strip. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and they were freakin' awesome. The homemade engrish muff, the hollandaise, hell, even the hash browns were spot on and don't usually like hash browns. Good! Throw in a mimosa and you've got yerself a nice breakfast. .      The other time I had muesli with fresh berries. Again, really good. .    I've seen a few refer to this as a tourist trap, but I didn't get that vibe at all. Give it a shot.
Husband ordered corned beef hash with quality coffee. I had fruit and croissant. It was cheaper than back home. What a view on the terrace with gorgeous quality food! It was such a romantic spot. This was Father's Day and the support staff were amazing... Clearing plates, refills, and getting to go boxes. Note: my items were cheeper than most to go places and it's way better!
Such a neat atmosphere. Lighting is rather dark and I saw many older people asking for flashlights to read the menu. They were very accommodating for my mother who has several food allergies. The bacon dressing was very greasy and became a lardy mess after a few minutes of sitting and cooling.
Ate here years ago and had a good experience. Was finally able to go back recently and really enjoyed the food. Make a reservation on Open Table ahead of time to avoid waiting. Their fresh baked bread out of the oven is soooo good. . . Last time I ate a steak (I remember it being delicious), but this time I opted fortheir onion soup and frisee kale & warm bacon salad. Both were really delicious - I was especially surprised by the salad... scarfed the whole thing down quickly! At first glance the soup doesn't look cheesy enough, but somehow I never ran out of cheese. The bowl was so huge, I could only finish half. Service was good & food arrived promptly - no complaints!
The atmosphere is pretty but the steaks were tough. Service was good. Bread, fries, and salad were good. Too bad the steaks were so disappointing.
What a little gem this restaurant is, located in Paris! This is always at the top of our list of places to eat whenever we go to Vegas.  If we don't stay at Paris, this is probably THE only reason we step foot into that hotel. Food is so wonderful, I usually get the Rib-Eye & it is always seasoned and cooked so perfectly!  Price is as good as it gets for the quality of food that you are getting.  Highly recommend this place for a nice and delicious steak dinner!
Amazing place and can't beat the service, environment, view, and price. I had an amazing time here on my date. Will define tally be coming back. One if my favorite spots in the strip.
I brought my parents here for Easter and we all had the Steak Bearnaise - the portion was huge, service was excellent and we were all very happy!   You need reservations - the place gets packed!   A few weeks ago I brought a friend visiting out of town here. Again, the food was fantastic, but it was packed. Make a reservation!
Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorites on the strip. It has a true parisian feel, and a very professional staff. Their food is great, and at good value on the strip, and an extensive wine list. The waiters know the wine as well, so don't be afraid to ask for recomendations. . . Be sure to make a reservation if you're going for brunch/lunch on the weekend, it's a popular spot.
Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I go there every time I visit. . Last visit wasn't as great because the food wasn't as well-prepared as I'm accustomed to there, but maybe it was an off night. That night was also too loud and crowded to hear the music from the Bellagio fountains that I usually enjoy from the outdoor patio area. Regardless, I will be back!. The service was great from our Rhode Island born and raised server! :-)
Very well done breakfast in an aesthetically pleasing place. I felt like I was in Paris.
Did Tao, and Lavo and then Mon Ami Gabi this week. Mon Ami Gabi blew the others away.  The service especially from Carlos And Georgina are out of this world.   The merlot sauce is out of this world.  The only place I always visit when I got to Vegas. Tried to Mousse for the first time... Wow.
Great place for a steak. I try to come every visit to vegas and always get the hanger steak. If you don't make dinner reservations, there's usually a wait. I went solo a few days ago and was able to sit at back bar immediately. The steak was delicious as expected and the bartenders were awesome.
Steaks were delicious.  Fabulous people watching!  We got to sit with views of the fountains at Bellagio so got to enjoy 2 shows during the course of our dinner.
Went for lunch today... 110 degrees outside.... so decided to sit in the conservatory instead of directly on the patio. Still a fabulous view and a few degrees cooler.. Lunch was great!. Escargot was very nice, and the baguette bread dipped in the pesto garlic butter sauce....YUMMY!!!. Lobster Roll and House Special Chicken Sandwich were delicious.. Really like this place... nice food, nice ambiance, good service, I recommend giving it a try.
Really good food at decent prices (for being on the strip).  Not a traditional steakhouse but just as good as many of them.  Sitting out on the strip is very nice at nighttime.
Being an out of towner the dining choices in Vegas is overwhelming, but you probably can't go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi. . . Met with a friend who lives in Vegas and is a total Vegas insider and he recommended this place and we were not disappointed. Let's start with the awesome setting. You have a front row seat of the Bellagio fountain show if you opt for outdoor seating. Now let's talk about the food. The food was fresh, delicious and well presented. Lastly, the prices were very reasonable and the service was great. I'm really happy I gave this place a try, will come back again when in the area.
I made reservations here out of convenience since I was staying at the Paris Hotel, and it definitely did not disappoint. . . Wait - . About 5 minutes on a Saturday night with reservations. There's a separate line that you wait in if you have reservations, but it moves very quickly. I made the reservations only 2 hours before.. . Service - (4/5). Pretty good. Nothing particularly memorable. . . Food - (5/5). Excellent! Their freshly made baguette was excellent, and a great starter (not to mention free)! I had their Filet Mignon Au Poivre Steak Frite, which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. At $31.95, it was definitely a good quality steak that was tender all throughout the meat. We also had the Caramelized Sea Scallops and the special Salmon Salad. My only qualm about the scallops is that it was small in portion, and definitely not filling as an entree in itself.. . Price - $$$ (Including wine). Fairly affordable considering the meal was less than $150 for 4 including three entrees and two glasses of wine.
My friend and I, after a long day in conferences were looking to chill, have great food, ambiance etc. Of course after looking at its great reviews, and me being french, I figured why the hell not! . I had made a reservation earlier in the day since the night before we swung by and the wait was well over an hour. We arrived right on time. The 2 reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is the following:. 1- you cannot make a rez on the patio. 2- the A/C is too high inside! Yes it's scortching hot in vegas right now but food, especially great food, does not like A/C!. Our waiter was great, maybe a smidge too "buddy like", but both of us really enjoyed our food, the fact that we could hear each other speaking and the lack of greatly needed sensory overload. After all isn't Las Vegas a luxurious version of ikea, aka the rat trap. Clearly you can tell Vegas is not my scene necessarily but would recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone, including the typical french man. So thanks to you yelpers in making what could have been an impossible task in finding good dinning a painless and enjoyable experience. J.
My husband and I go here every time we are in Vegas.  The service andfood are worth every penny.  We love to sit on the patio, people watch, and watch the Bellagio fountains.  We enjoy the warm Brie as a starter.  The chicken and steak are so tender and flavorful.  I especially love the steak with the blue cheese sauce.  It melts in your mouth.  You don't even need a knife to cut it.  Some say the prices are high but I think the prices match the quality of food you are getting.
As a vegas local this is one of the only places ill venture to the strip for to have a meal.  The escargot is here is the only place Ill order it, streaks are great... make sure you sub out the pomme frites if your not a fan, they're not normal "french fries" as the name suggests, but rather wide long potato sections (think pickle shape) so you're not traditional, who cares? Do make sure you ask to be seated on the "outdoor/indoor patio"  you won't be outside per say, but dinning out of the old school dining room without having to see/hear thousands of drunk tourists ruining your dining experience.  . its great food without being too uptight.
GREAT VIEW. . . THE BREAD WAS GREAT. . . Hashbrowns, steak, and eggs were mediocre. We could of gotten something else cheaper and more delicious. . . We ordered the prime steak and eggs, and it was horrible. The wait was long, and the best part was the toast.. . We also ordered the steak sandwich with the dip. IT WAS AMAZINGLY delicious. All the juice and onions blended together. I would definitely reccomnend this. . . I would give this place 3 stars, but the extra star is for the great view. There is also an abundance of staff here. and so if you were to come here I reccomend making a reservation for outside seating.
Terrible idea and it was a disappointing meal on the strip I'll never have back.  I don't understand how this place got such good reviews.. . My girlfriend and I decided to come here last time we were in Vegas.  I had high hopes given the pictures and reviews.  Lighting was on the dark side and environment was loud, if you're into that sort of setting.  The bread was good, and that's a problem if that's the best I can say about the meal.  My girlfriend had the steak frites, which was dry and rough.  I went for my usual order of choice at most restaurants, the bone in rib-eye, medium rare.  It came out looking great, and in hindsight, maybe the dark lighting helped.  It was "quite literally" the worst rib-eye I've ever had.  Either I had a dull steak knife or that was one tough SOB.  Trying to chew through that thing and not being successful confirmed that it was the latter.  I thought maybe it might just be that particular part of the cut and continued.  But time and again, every piece I had just added to the disappointment.  The only beneficiary of this meal?  My dog, who got the bone and leftover.. hopefully he enjoyed it more than I did.. . Don't see myself coming back here again any time soon.
Fantastic oysters! Incredible service! Reasonable prices. Great mushroom soup. My only complaint was that my steak was lacking flavor.
I'm not going to tell you anything that the other reviews have said.  Mon Ami is great.  We go there every time we're in Vegas and we've never disappointed.  This time we made reservations on Open Table about an hour prior and got seated at a table just inside of the patio with a great view of the fountains.. . We ordered brie for an app, we both had steaks for an entree, and chocolate mousse and bread pudding for dessert.  Service was attentive was not overbearing and the food was great.. . Great prices for the Strip, too.
Lordie it was so hot and mother was starved and exhausted from walking.  We stumbled into Mon Ami Gabi not by choice but because someone, I shall not name names, needed to void.  . . We were lured in with the cool breeze but for some reason I wanted to sit outside.  It was a mistake because it was scorching hot but also a good decision because we got to watch the water show at the Bellagio at least twice during our meal.  . . I thought the price was surprisingly fair for being a restaurant located on the strip.  We order escargot (favorite), chilled seafood platter, grilled salmon and spinach salad, and of course a glass of wine for me.  The total was slightly north of $100.. . The escargot was pretty good, it was softer and less chewy than other placed tried.  The seafood platter was amazing, it came with maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and salmon tartare.  This dish was shared between three people.  And lastly, we had the grilled salmon salad which was delish.  It had avocado, walnuts, blueberries, and a citrus dressing, so good.. . I will definitely make a stop the next time I visit Vegas.
Great location, fantastic service, amazing bread....the list goes on. . The entrees needs little improvement, but can't complain too much!
I used to LOVE this place.  As a veggie lover I used to love their vegetable platter which is now off the menu and replaced with some pathetic veggie broth thing that I could easily make (and it taste much better) at home.  If you are vegan or vegetarian just skip it and go to the Wynn or Encore where EVERY SINGLE RESTAURANT has excellent vegan options (many with vegan bread and butter).  Now for those people that don't care about veggies I will say the place has gone downhill in general. Last time we were there they were out of duck (so no duck confit at a french restaurant) and I think all foul for that matter.  We told the server we did not like the new veggie broth dish and did not like whatever my wife order in place of duck and she did not offer to take anything off the bill. It is the only time I have ever tipped just 10% at a fine dining restaurant and I haven't been back since.
I had such a LOVELY time here at Mon Ami!!. . I have booked marked this restaurant forever and finally had a night to try!! First off, if you're parking in the Paris parking lot, I had trouble navigating inside the hotel to find the restaurant. Be sure to ask around or you'll be walking in circles like I did... It's must easier if you don't bother driving at all and just walk on the strip bc it's located right outside the Paris hotel.... . Seating was fast and plentiful even on a Saturday night even when we didn't make any reservations.. We decided to sit outside on the patio and for a great view of the Bellagio fountains. What a way to eat dinner!! Dinner and a view!. . I ordered the kale frisee salad with the mussels while the BF ordered the steak with peppercorn sauce. I must say, I'm not much of a meat eater so I'm not a big steak fan but I took a bite out of his steak and it was sooo tender and delicious! Very soft meat and flavorful!! I looked over to my BF and within minutes that steak was gone!! I took a couple of his frites too and I LOVED how crispy they are! Perfectly cooked! My kale salad was delicious! Loved their dressing and huge chunks of bacon with a perfectly poached egg on top!! The mussels were also delicious!! The BF kept dipping the complimentary bread into the sauce even after he finished his steak!!. . Overall, we had a lovely time at Mon Ami! Perfect way to start the trip!
ehh  overrated!!. price was ok, but the food was not. . Our steak was really thin and dry. We requested medium-rare but what they gave us was overcooked... other plates didn't have much flavor.. . One thing I HATED!!about this place was the menu they handed us.. I was sticky, dirty, blurry at some parts... ewww. seriously, they should print new ones and put new covers on it..
This place was fantastic.. one of the best meals I've had in Vegas! The place is beautiful with great views of the Bellagio Fountains which was really nice during our meal. The service was topnotch from the hostess to the server who helped us. I ordered a lobster roll it was tasty and way more than I could manage to finish. The french onion soup was also quite good (a pretty big bowl too). For desert we had the bananas foster holy cow it was so good but way too big.. more for like 3 people. I will be coming back to this restaurant for sure next time I'm in town. Can't beat awesome service!
I live in Las Vegas, and my boyfriend and I LOVE to frequent this restaurant! Great atmosphere, great food, and great people watching!  We enjoy going any afternoon/evening.... we always request to sit on the patio front so that we can have the strip view, and it also gives us the opportunity to see the beautiful Bellagio fountain show as well.... we always have a few beers or glasses of wine while enjoying the Baked Goat Cheese, the Mussels Mariniere and the yummy fresh baked bread!. . I have always had a great time at this restaurant! The service has been consistently wonderful and charming each time we have been.  Would definitely recommend going for anyone who hasn't been!
I am really pleased with this nail salon. They are always very sweet and enthusiastic. Really enjoy this salon and will be a valuable customer.
I loved my dinner here!. . When I found our we were going to Vegas for a work meeting, I did my research to decide where I wanted to eat. Now Vegas has a ton of fantastic restaurants, most of them steak house themed, but I wanted something different. I opted for French. . . Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris resort, tucked away in the front corner. . . After perusing the menu, I went with the crock of French onion soup, the mussels appetizer ( soak up the sauce with your French bread) and the trout almandine. All of it was fantastic! . . I was stuffed but still managed to order a slice of strawberry shortcake to go. This too was perfectly baked and had the light texture that SS should have. . . When back in Vegas, I'll take another trip to Paris and eat at Mon Ami Gabi.
We come to Vegas about 4 times a year. Mon Ami Gabi is a staple for us. We make sure to hit it once for breakfast and again for dinner. Food is always outstanding and it's right on the strip. Bonus: Outstanding view of Bellagio fountains
Excellent French breakfast on the Strip. I had the Quiche Lorraine with a side of the best strips of bacon I have ever had in my life! My beautiful girlfriend had the waffles and a side of eggs. We paired all this up with coffee and macchiato. Delicious and a great price for the quality and atmosphere. Well done!
The atmosphere and service were great. The food was below average.
Was a good food, prices are ok for vegas. The server was a bit stressed out, but otherwise overall good experience. I'd recommend to make a reservation.
Very great place to have dinner.  Incredible location if your staying near Caesars Palace and Bellagio it's walking distance.   . . The Tuna Nicoise Salad was awesome.  Tuna was perfect, the salad was a complete meal.  . . The $10.95 French Onion soup was however not worth the price.   I wish I had saved that room and money for dessert.. . With reservations, you still need to wait in line to be seated.  And the outside wait was 1.5hrs at 8:00pm.
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants for years! Definitely the best french cuisine in Las Vegas but the service is not all there anymore. The hostesses are VERY rude like they are angry to be at work and when we decided to speak to a manager about it he blew us off and was very, very rude to us, kind of like we were bothering him. Don't get me wrong, to date it is my favorite french restaurant in LV but maybe a refresher in customer service would be nice.
Similar to other reviewers, we got a good view of the Bellagio fountain from our table. The Hangar Steak and Filet Mignon were great, loved the brie andfrench onion soup. Obviously, it's a nice french restaurant and the service and food are top notch.  It's a great option for something along the strip. We made reservations via opentable and it was easy and convenient.  Would definitely come back for dinner, as well as lunch, brunch, anything.
Audrey Dorenbaum made me feel like I was her only client.  She worked feverishly to sell my home and help me to down size to a smaller home in Summerlin, Nv
One of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Great view of the Fountains of Bellagio.  Sit outside if you can stand the heat or cold.
don't let the tourist location throw you. terrific French food on the strip without the strip prices.
Friendly and helpful service. Quality food. Love the fries and French bread with homemade butter.
Love love this place!!! My favorite restaurant on the strip!!! Beautiful view of the dazzling Bellagio fountains (if you dine al fresco on their outdoor patio) Incredible ambiance, amazing food, service and wait staff!! The prices are extremely reasonable for a strip restaurant with a prime view!! I highly recommend their scallops, steak frites, and any salmon dish!! Great wine list and desserts!! Good coffee also!! Worth the wait time if you don't have a reservation. Been here numerous times for dinner, but now have to make it a point to come in for breakfast or brunch one of these days. I heard it is fantastic!!
Juicy steaks !!!  Love sitting outside in early summer and watching the people.
My mom and I made reservations same day got the patio and everything from there was amazing. I got the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. even the mashed potatoes were amazing. Of course its vegas and can get pretty crazy during dining hours. But everything was right on time and we in and out. Definitely a place i'll always stop at when in vegas. Our waiter was also helpful and accommodating.
We came here during my friend's bach and I was pleasantly surprised.  I've been to France and had great French food and also bad French Food so I wasn't sure where this restaurant would land.. . I enjoyed the meals here.. . Baked Goat Cheese -- I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but this goat cheese was delicious.  Covered with the tomato sauce and dipped with bread completed the flavor profile.. . Escargot -- The escargot was tender and it was quite delicate but I will never get over eating a snail.  I don't think I'll eat it again, not because it wasn't tasty but because of my reservations.. . Trout Amandine -- I'm not a fan of cooked fish but this was quite enjoyable.  . . All in all, the meal here was great.  Not too pricy considering other restaurants
This place has everything. Great food, great price, and a great view. I recommend this place as the go to restaurant if you have never been to Vegas before. An added tip is to come early and request a spot outside so you can get a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.
I have been coming here for 5 years. and I'm from Vegas. This spot is the best. My favorite restaurant.
