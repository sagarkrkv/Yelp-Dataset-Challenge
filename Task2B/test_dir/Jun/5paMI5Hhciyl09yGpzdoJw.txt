From dropping off the car at "Valet" to "Check In", and then up to our room, the process was quick and easy. The rooms at the Palazzo are not your ordinary hotel rooms, they are five star!  Make sure to ask for a room facing the strip.
I usually stay at the V, but the last time I stayed there the experience was less than satisfactory.  I wrote a review, and the Manager responded w/ an upgrade to a Fortuna Suite at the Palazzo (I paid $129/night vs the room normally costs $199/night).  Needless to say, I was very impressed.. . The Fortuna seemed liked it was 2X the size of regular suites at the V.  In addition to having the standard large bathroom w/ two sinks, separate shower and TV, the sleeping area was roomy.  It had a desk and the closet wasn't right up against the bed like a standard suite.  Additionally, the sunken living room was spacious.  There was a separate sitting area w/ an ottoman.  Lastly, it also had a great view.  . . We were able to check in at the special desk vs general population.  Additionally, the room had not been cleaned by the time we returned from breakfast.  We decided to take a nap before heading out, so the maid had to skip our room.  However, when we left for a pool party around noon, I informed the maid the room was ready for cleaning:  The room was cleaned when we returned in the late afternoon.  I wrote the less than satisfactory experience the last time I was here, because the same thing happened, but the maid didn't clean the room.  . . The V used to be the only place I stay in Vegas, but add the P to the list too.  The suites are spacious & luxurious, and the service is excellent.
One of the nicer hotels I've stayed in. Each suite has a sunken living room with soft couches and a desk which is a really nice touch. 4 stars for how beautiful and new it is, and the fact that they lost our luggage for 2 hours and then tried to blame it on us. Thanks to the Palazzo I never check my luggage at hotels anymore! Would come again, but carry my own bags.
I love the rooms here , very private and very modern with a beautiful view to the strip
paid $120/night using priceline.  hubby used something called a tip sandwich to get upgraded view, no resort fee, and free wifi!    Room was super nice and had no issues with anything (except there was no coffee maker in the room :( ).  . . There is the most amazing walgreens next door to this hotel.  Go there to get your alcohol, water and snacks.  They even have fro yo and smoothies there.  All other walgreens should take note.
Technically I would give this hotel 4.5 stars because our 4 day stay was absolutely amazing! The Palazzo check-in desk gave us no problem nor an extra charge to check in after our early morning flight. . You can't do a girls trip without a fabulous view and the Palazzo offered a great complimentary view (no upgrade charges). Every morning we woke up to the Wynn hotel, two pools, wynn golf resort, and awesome mountain views. We chose the bella suite which offered two comfortable queen beds and a plush L shaped couch in a sunken swanky living room. On day 2 we discovered the curtains were automatic as well as the shades, the child in me found this very cool by the way. . The housekeeping service was five star all of the way! Our room was cleaned to perfection everyday with turn down service.. Be sure to check out the canal shoppes, it offers a variety of high end stores with great restaurants. I found the Palazzo offered a calm scene, a little more rowdy on the weekend, with an amazing waterfall.. The casino was very busy on the weekend, but slower during the day. The crowd is  a mix of cultures who don designer gear, no matter what age.. I have stayed in both the Venetian and the Palazzo and neither will disappoint you!
Check in- 5 mins. . Room- BIG and beautifully appointed with the best bed ever!!. . Parking- easy and fast. . Grounds- AMAZING- the mall that is attached gives way to the Venetian and Gondola . Ride.  The walk through the Venetian was like a stroll in the park on a beautiful day.  . . Location- End of strip and easy access to Freeway and main streets.. . Pools--WOW, WOW and WOW- Enormous pools and so many to choose from.  I . thought the pools would be boring but I was wrong.  They are beautiful and not crowded with a bunch of attention seeking, obnoxious people.  Loved it here.. . Overall- One of the best Hotels on the Strip.  Give it a chance if you like a less crowded atmosphere with elegant surroundings and a great view of the strip.
Finding a Vegas hotel to COMFORTABLY house 9 girls while still maintaining glitz, glamour, and reasonable prices for a Bachelorette Weekend is not an easy feat. After scouring numerous sites and calling various hotels, I came to the conclusion that getting 2 Siena Suites at the Palazzo was going to be the best deal. I have absolutely no regrets.. . We arrived late at night, so the line for check-in was minimal. We had 2 connecting suites, as requested (for an additional fee of course). The rooms were clean, pretty updated (although nothing like Aria or Cosmopolitan), and sleek. Each room had 2 Queen beds, a wrap-around couch with coffee table, desk area, TV, and a huge bathroom. The couch pulled out to makea sofa...easily enough room for at least 2 people if necessary.  My only qualm about the bathroom was that, although huge, the shower stall was see-through. This is fine if you're there with a significant other, but if you're there with a group of new acquaintances, it can be awkward. Whenever one of us showered, the whole bathroom was basically closed off. So, huge bathroom-great, see-through shower-not so great.. . The hotel itself is connected to the Venetian which allows for tons of shopping, restaurants, and nightlife in both hotels without ever having to step outside. The Palazzo is on the North side of the strip, but still near a lot of city's attractions.. . There is a Coffee Bean near the Casino, but, like everything else in Vegas, it is overpriced. Still good to have nearby, none the less.. . Many pools to choose from but if you don't get there early, you'll be searching like a hawk for a lounge chair. If you come past noon and want to sit with you friends, forget about it.. . There's also a 24 hour Walgreens right next door to the hotel. This is not your average Walgreens. They have everything you would need from souvenirs to alcohol to clothes.
We were only outside at the pools here for the Epicurean Affair in May. Highly anticipated event, I encourage all to go next year.  . . All the pool areas were lovely and arranged really nicely. The food event was the bomb and was done very well. . . Food was incredible!
First visit was great.  Rooms are spacious and are a good value.  Second visit we arrived from Hawaii at 732 am.  They had rooms available, but wanted to charge $75 per room (2 rooms) to check us in before 8.  Really? Terrible customer service policy.  So my family and I stood in the lobby (which is empty as you can imagine) for 28 minutes and THEN checked in.  One of the rooms was not clean yet.   Took a little while to get someone up to clean the restroom.  It really annoys me when client service  is not priority. I don't understand how the CSR couldn't look around and check us in.  Room deserves 4-5 stars, check in policy deserves no stars.  Very disappointed.
Love the palazzo have been to Vegas many times and was told by my good friends how they love that property and now I know why! Guest services was awesome, room was fanatic shops and restaurants were out of control! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that pool area is alil dead not too happening for over 25 & over crowd but besides that we would totally stay there again next time we are in Vegas!
If you're going to stay in Vegas, you might as well do it right especially when it comes your hotel. The Palazzo proved to be a stellar choice for our Girls' Weekend Getaway, and it made all the difference in the overall fun that we had. . . Our suite was as spacious as it was impressive. Decked out with a stand-up shower, huge separate tub, double sinks, our very own living room, comfy beds, a pull out sofa bed, dining table, desk area, telephone in the toilet area (also separate from the actual bathroom), two TVs (one in the bathroom, the other in the bedroom), electronic window shades, comfort and extravagance were not lacking. We were situated right on The Strip which made all the difference as we desired to be in the mix of everything and to walk, rather than cab it to our destinations.. . So there you have it. The rooms are lovely. But what about the facilities and overall resort? Gaw-jus. The entrance is grand, the property is massive, and the staff is helpful and courteous. The Palazzo is an addition to The Venetian, another lovely hotel option. So lucky for us, a suite at the Palazzo granted us access to all of its 11 pools. And there really is a pool for everyone. Want to relax with the family? Want to lay out in some peace and quiet by your lonesome? Want to swim with your honey and get some jacuzzi action in? Want to people watch-- beautiful people at that? Want to strut your stuff, party or day drink? You get a pool! You get a pool! And you get a pool! Our group chose the best of both worlds and opted for both fun and relaxation. But the most memorable aspect when it came down some pool action was Tao Beach (review to follow).  Fun! Crazy crazy crazy fun! Great music, decent food, and overall everything that a Vegas pool party should be.. . The restaurant options are plentiful and the shopping options are .... well... expensive. Reviews to follow on these too. The nightclub was fantastic too. Very different feel from the outdoor clubs we experienced the night before, but equally as good- if not better. We had an over-the-top great time. Best of all, it's right in the hotel so no mile walk in your high heels, ladies.. . Lastly, I'm not the type of girl to gamble so the casino was my least favorite. Though large and updated, it wreaked of smoke and we didn't spend much time there. Also you have to walk through it to get around the property. Meh. I did like that they had phone chargers on some of the slot machines. Another way to keep you there longer, but very convenient.. . Overall, the property was everything that we needed and more. Most rooms, like ours, offer a beautiful view if you are a few floors up. And most likely if you get in early enough and ask for one, you shall receive. Of course there are lots of places to choose from when it comes to hotels, but this is a solid choice for a weekend getaway. I'd definitely stay here again.
The Palazzo is my new favorite place to stay in Vegas. The basic suites are big -- probably bigger than my first apartment! I had a great view of the strip and the remote controlled blinds and curtains are a nice touch. Big, comfy beds on the first level, and the second level was a spacious area with a sectional, desk and kitchen table. It was nice to have a gorgeous view and a spacious workspace while I worked on my laptop. Equally huge bathroom with a large glass enclosed shower stall. The TV above the sink was handy while getting ready in the morning.. . The front desk was well staffed and I didn't have to wait more than a minute to check-in unlike most hotels on the strip. The staff was friendly and professional.. . Some of the best restaurants in Vegas are at the Palazzo/Venetian, but they aren't cheap. There are some cheaper options like the Grand Lux cafe, which was OK for breakfast and lunch, but nothing special. You get what you pay for. . . Speaking of what you pay, the Palazzo charges a mandatory resort fee of $15/day that is not included in the base rate. So make sure you factor that in when booking your room.
I loved staying at this property. It was able to accommodate the four of us comfortably. The layout of the Palazzo is relatively simple and  straightforward to get into the hotel room. Our taxi dropped us off at the front of hotel where we walked straight to the registration desk. Checking into the hotel was relatively simple and expedient. We then walked through the casino to the elevator doors. Be careful about which elevator you are taking as each one goes to a different section of the tower.. . We had a corner room overlooking Wynn which was really nice. The electronic shades added a sophistication to the room. The only gripe about the room was the pull out sofa bed. They don't provide a comforter for that particular bed so you have to request it. I had to ask multiple times and they still didn't bring me an adequate comforter which was so disappointing. . . We also used the pool amenities as well. However, when we got to the towel dispensary, they ran out of towels. We were annoyed by this but luckily, we just asked out friend who happened to be in the room to bring some of the room towels until they restocked. There were two different pools, both of them quite shallow. The pool was decent, but felt they cold have made the pool area better. Also, we ventured to Azure which is Palazzo's "equivalent" to a day club. However, I would recommend not going there as we witnessed a verbal altercation between some of the guests and employees which would have made for a good reality show.. . In all, Palazzo was very comfortable. I just wish Palazzo was more centrally located as we ended up taking so many taxi's to get to the south part of the strip.
