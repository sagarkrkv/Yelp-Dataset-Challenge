My brother and I really wanted to eat here because we used to watch a lot of Gordon Ramsay food shows. We had high expectations for this restaurant and we were definitely not disappointed. The food was amazing and the service was also really good! . . I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, which was really delicious! There was a lot of lobster inside the Mac and cheese, which made the price worth it. For dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, which was also really yummy!
this review is really 3-4ish stars. solid food for lunch. . . fish and chips: generous portion of 2 thick and tender (not overly salty) cod filets. ask for the fries to be extra crispy.. . lobster mac n cheese side dish had nice parmesan flavor along with plenty of lobster chunks. . . bangers and mash comes with 3 plump sausages of different meats: chicken, pork and beef. . . sticky toffee pudding was a winner!!
This place was very good. Atmosphere was good and the price was little pricey though the food was plentiful and delicious. We had a god waitress that went through the menu well. The tomato soup is excellent!!!  Thank you
Come on - Gordon Ramsay not being good? I don't know how that would be possible. . Now to be fair - this is pub-style food, true to British form, so don't go expecting Americanized flavor-overload. That being said, the flavors were like simple taken up a notch and the spotted dic pudding was fabulous!!! Divine. Best. Ever.. If I'm in Vegas again, I'd jump at the chance to eat here again!
Gordon Ramsey's in London was one of the most exquisite dining experiences in my life. The "Pub & Grill" was not. It is competent food, served efficiently, in a fun atmosphere. It is a step (or two) up in the quality and inventiveness of the food of Chili's or BJ's, with a more "sophisticated" beer and wine list. They handled our group of 14 even better than expected. It was impressive; Ramsey really does know how to run a restaurant. They messed up some items on our order, and more than made up for it by comping those items and apologizing. Our total bill was around $860, including tip. (~$61/each). If you expect haute cuisine, try one of Ramsey's other places. For well-prepared pub food, the Pub & Grill is a good, but pricy spot.
Loud, crowded & full of energy- not unlike Chef Ramsay! . My visit was at the bar to check out the drink menu for a future visit here. Lots of specialty cocktails & I'm impressed that one, Ramsay Tonic, is gin based.  Bartenders were easy going & happy to answer questions. . Forsake the touristy vibe here & would be a great hangout pre whatever show or event you're heading to.
The food ain't even out yet but Imma do this review anyways. Our waitress seems to be lost most of the time. I asked for some lime/lemon for the water and she never brought it. We have a table for six and it has been 40 mins since we ordered and still nothing on the table yet. Our water needs refilling at this point in time but she just looks at us and keeps moving. I'm so thirsty right now i feel like im about to go drink from the water fountain at the bellagio The chair is unusually high with no backrest in this joint. Better be carefully or u Crack your head when u slip. . . I'll edit this review once the food comes out... . . . The food is OK. Not great, not good, but ok. I expected more from a Gordon ramsay restaurant seeing how they put him on TV and shit. Now i know why he's pissed all the time, it's all shitty. How do you not provide spoons when customers order soup? The rice was stale. The steak was very bitter. The clam chowder is good, but i think i like progresso better. I'll stick with yelps reviews next time. . . Btw, did I mentioned that their chairs are super uncomfortable??
The name alone is worth checking this place out because if any of you have seen any of his shows he strives to be the best and well this place is almost just that. I can honestly say I have never had such amazing service in my life. Not only do they refill your drinks the second they are low but they also know what you want before you even ask its pretty awesome. But besides the great service the food is also really great. I had there lamb burger which was recommended by the staff. I was here for lunch so its unfortunate i wasn't able to try there dinner menu. There prices are sort of high but then again it is Vegas so that is kind of expected. Overall its a great place and well worth checking out.
great cocktails and bartenders, we sat at the bar and had the pork rillete!! amazing-ness!!!
I ate four times at at Ramsey pub and grill at caesars palace during my stay. Great beer selection. The bangers and mashed is excellent. The blt was just ok. The pulled pork tastes just like tuna. The barkeeps were friendly knowledgeable and fun. The prices were were reasonable for the strip. Cheers.
Dined here for lunch on 06/04/14.. . Ordered:. Mini Pub Burgers - (2) sliders with great taste and nice grilled buns.  . Loli-Pop Chicken Wings - I should have been suspect of Loli-Pop in the title. Only ordered 6. Teeny-Tiny Things. Stilton Cheese Dip they came with was incredible!. . Toad In The Hole - Pastry wrapped sausage with a wild and crazy mustard dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was the star of this dish.. . Lackluster waiter.. . Husband ordered a beer. Total bill was $50.00.. . Not bad. Not over the top wonderful.. . I think my husband's thoughts of my becoming a food snob may be coming to fruition...
This is my third visit to the pub, by far the worst food I've ever had in Vegas. I ordered the meat platter appetizer, the pate' was too sweet to eat and there was a sausage that was disgusting. I really thought the revamped fish and chips would be better. One of the pieces of fish was so over cooked was it fried twice? The scallops were only cooked on one side. GR needs to train his cooks again, the whole experience was far below expectations.
Went to Gordon Ramsey Pub about 6 months ago. I was not overly impressed, but thought I would try it again. I am in Vegas often and was looking for a decent casual place. Mini burgers were dry and cold. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good, but not great. I told the waitress of my burger complaint and she did not seem interested. . . Apparently the standard that Chef Ramsey has on his television shows are not the same in his restaurants. It seems to me if you put your name to something and profess excellence, it should be excellent; not just alright.
Just okay and pricey for bar food.  A cheeseburger, coffee, beer and fish and chips were $80 with tip.
Mixed feelings so it's best to judge it by what is it not what you wish it was. . . Its an English Pub. Any relation to Mr. Ramsay is probably a marketing coincidence. . . As a pub it has the usual great beer and okay food. We had calamari - burgers - shepherds pie - all well inexpensive ($15 $17 $23 I think) and serviceable enough. But the same food you would get at the Rusty Gull or Bob's Roadhouse in pointe-de-rubber-boot.. . The staff are cheery and service is excellent. They seem oddly extra happy as they consistently high low five each other quite energetically as they pass my table. . . With the endless supply of options in Vegas there is nothing special about this place that makes you want to go back. So we won't.. . But I'm going to give it 3 stars based on service and prices.
Meh. GORDON RAMSEY'S PUB AND GRILL at Caesar's wasn't terrible - but it didn't live up to the expectations I had for it. Especially after I loved "BurGR" so much.. . We shared some Spicy Bacon Deviled Eggs and those were solid. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and thought it was pretty good too. Other items ordered at our table were a mixed bag. I did enjoy that they had Dogfish 90 and Lagunitas on tap.. . We had a super sweet server, and everything was pretty good. But it wasn't mind blowing enough for me to return to with so many choices in Vegas.. . 3.5 stars. Solid, but overpriced and not spectacular.
My wife originally wanted to go to the steak house at the Paris but once we realized it was going to be About $400 for lunch we opted for the Pub. First impressions nice atmosphere clean bright vibrant. We sat down with our daughter and waited about 20 minutes for a server to come. I was hungry and went straight away for the toad in the hole and the diver scallops I told the waiter I had not had toad in the hole in over 20 yrs. he explained it was not traditional at which I realized it was basically a pig in a blanket. I changed my order to scotch egg and chicken curry my wife had fish and chips. When the waiter eventually came with the food all at the same time I think a quail egg was used for the scotch egg I got scallops instead of the curry. My wife's food was okay at best for $16 F&E but they cost $30. Scallops overlooked. $180 for two and a half peeps with two drinks each. A lot of dosh for bad nosh, Done!!!!!!!
I'm beginning to get the feeling that every celebrity chef restaurant in town is merely a siphon for tourist cash and nothing more. The quality of food rarely ever meets the expectation that comes with the famous talking head promoting it. Gordon Ramsay demands quality on screens worldwide, but when it comes to his restaurants you get what you pay for. High quality does necessarily not trickle down from the mega-bucks eateries these celebrity chefs own.  . . After a decent wait - because these hot spots are always packed - my gf & I took a seat in the back. We were here at an odd hour late in the day, so we decided to just get a couple drinks and split some appetizers. That "couple of drinks" became one when we checked the menu and noticed each signature cocktail was $15 a pop. Now, yes, I know I could've just had something else but where's the fun in that? Still, there's no way in hell I'm going to try getting drunk on $15 drinks. I ordered a Pub Crawl, which was bourbon whiskey with ginger liqueur, lemon, and mint & black tea syrup. Tasted great, would've loved a few more... but not at that price. . . For the apps, we decided on a Scotch egg and the pot pie sampler, which included mini versions of their steak, chicken, and shepherd's pie. . . The Scotch egg was killer. I've had this exactly twice before in my life - the first time was very good, the second time it was two burnt lumps of sausage surrounding a medium-boiled egg. This blew both of those away. I would assume if they can make a Scotch egg great anywhere, it's going to be here. . . Now, the pot pie sampler shows up and it's tiny. Really tiny. Tyrion Lannister's little mitts would make these pies look small, and in my hands they looked like silver dollars. At $24 (which is $8/each), you'd think the serving size would be double. Too bad, because the steak pie was delicious. Chicken pot pie is chicken pot pie, and this tasted like any other chicken pot pie. But the shepherd's pie was kinda rank. It smelled like dirty gym socks and didn't taste much better. WTF? I've had great shepherd's pie before and this was not even close. Lame. . . We grabbed the bill at this point and - HOLY SHIT - $72 and I'm not even full or drunk?!? I don't even have a mild buzz, and I'm already asking my gf where to eat next. If you feel like blowing twice that, go for dinner. Me, I'd rather fill up somewhere else just as good; a place that won't charge me for a fancy name.
Came here to watch the end of an NBA game because there are plenty of TVs and ordered the chicken wing lollipops. The wings were poorly done. They were dry, the breading was thick, and there was barely any sauce coating the wings. I will not be back to try other items on the menu.
"Gordon Ramsay would throw this plate across the room", said one of my co-workers after tasting their entree. . I went here on a Wednesday night with two co-workers, while in town for business.  We all decided to order the fish and chips, but there was little consistency between the three plates.  Both of my co-workers received three pieces of fish, that were barely deep fried.  The batter was very soggy with no crisp or crunch you expect with an order of fish and chips. One of the dishes came out missing the lemon wedge and tartar sauce, which was quickly brought upon request.  While mine were cooked longer and actually tasted good, I only received two pieces instead of three.  The 'chips' tasted very much like Burger King's fries, something you don't expect when paying this price.  A friendly waiter could have made this experience better, but ours wasn't very personable.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, especially with so many other options in Las Vegas.
Long wait ofcourse. I had the scallops it was good. My sister was satisfied with her burger. My brother didn't like the lamb but he liked the dessert, spotted dog and chocolate trifle. We expected better.
I got the Chicken Curry - It tasted like Hormel canned chili. Not impressed. The menu stated the curry was made with yogurt, though it has a tomato base. It was served with quarter sliced pita bread; curry is usually served with naan flat bread.. . Saw three couples sit down and walk out while I dined. Guessing the price was a shock. . . This is just another famously named restaurant with average food, overly priced that tourists end up paying for  #touristtrap
First of all, do not go here if you're looking for a fine dining experience. This is a pub. Expect a high noise level and pub food.. . With that said we had an ok evening. Food was good. A bit overpriced, but good. Best was the sticky toffee pudding (highly recommended) and the salmon with a lovely crispy skin.
the food is below average and bland ! from watching is shows i expected something spectacular, i was wrong, for a guy who likes to tell people on his show that they are terrible cooks he may want to pay closer attention to his own restaurant, i know its not "fine dining" but the prices sure are ! i miss the old vegas whenfood was great and cheap and they made money off of gambling, now corporations own it and they do the bare minimum, i liked it better when mobster ran it !
Not really very authentic if you are English. Fish and chips are ok but not great
We found ourselves here for dinner since one of my companions was too tired to leave Caesar's Palace for dinner. We made reservations and went up to our rooms to rest prior to eating.. . We were seated quickly and were entertained with World Cup Soccer on the TVs around us. We had very attentive waitstaff. There was a nice selection of beer on tap, which made my dining companions happy. We started with the fried calamari, which was yummy. I appreciated that they included the tentacle pieces since those are my favorite. What was pretty gross was the pond of grease that was at the bottom of the paper when we finished our meal. The kitchen needs to be a better job of draining the grease before serving.. . I had the BLT Duo. I wish I knew it was served cold ahead of time. Cold pork just isn't my thing. The pulled pork was more of a pulled pork salad since it was mixed with a light creamy dressing. A thick cold piece of bacon on top was less than appetizing. Minus a star right there. Again, I wish I knew ahead of time that it was served cold. I would definitely not order this again.. . One companion ordered the NY Strip. His comment was that it was much better than the NY steak at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. It came with a tiny portion of fingerling potatoes and asparagus. He asked the server for a piece of bread since the meal waspretty rich. The server said no. He indicated he would need to order the appetizer pretzel bread. This seemed unreasonable as we saw other dishes that had bread. This 80+ year old man wanted a small piece of bread with his steak. Seriously, the waiter should have brought him a piece of bread on the house. It's not like we didn't each order a full meal, plus appetizer and drinks from the bar. They lost 2 stars and a percentage of their tip right there. . . The other companion ordered the curry chicken. It's an Indian curry served with a side of chutney. I thought it was just ok, but my companion really liked it. By the end of the meal he was sweating from the spices.. . One last point: The seating is meant to be like a pub. Each table had different style of chairs and tables. Some were regular restaurant table and chairs, there was also traditional bar seating and other tables that were homey with high backed sitting room style chairs. We were seated on a raised table with high bar stool seats. It wasn't my preference to eat dinner on stools without back support. I wish the hostess checked in with us about this prior to seating, especially considering we had a senior citizen in our party. Minus one star for lack of consideration for any special needs of our party.
We came here months ago while on vacation and both tried the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips. The fish was crispy and not too greasy inside, chips were great as well. They were big portions, we could of shared one order. . . I like the other GR's Steak and BurGR better than this restaurant, but it didn't disappoint.
My wife would say.. Awesome, delicious... go.. . We had the truffle chips "Fries" and the Lollipop Chicken wings for apps, both were great and cooked to perfection.. . The wife had the scallops with clams. Said it was very tasty, i don't eat shell fish so I took her word. They looked very good, seared nicely on both sides.. . I had the Burger with bacon. It was outstanding, the beef was perfect and the chef knows what Medium means.. . Service was great, very attentive and we were seated within a minute of showing up at our reserved time... It was packed on the Friday night.. . We gave it 4 stars based only on the price... If you go, you will love it.
Craptastic service at the bar- But two stars for having Meantime Porter on Draft and tasty deviled eggs. Couldant endure the bar staff any longer so we bailed on this joint after finishing our beers..
Alex, our server is the reason for this low review. . . Service:. . Alex did not have a professional demeanor but rather was condescending in his remarks to our simple order of 2 items - the beef burger and calamari. He commented "3 people for 1 burger, really?" When in reality, we wanted to sample the food & order more if we were still hungry.. . The 5 STAR SERVICE goes to YOUR WATER BOY who was available when we needed to make our order To Go. (We almost missed our flight due to the delay) He was PROMPT, POLITE, and PROFESSIONAL. . . Food:. Tbh, the burger was salty. There was nothing extraordinary about the fries, either. . ALSO, Alex took our order of 2 simple items, incorrectly. . . Summary:. . NO, wewould not return nor recommend this location due to Alex's service, unnecessarily snarky remarks and poor attitude. The food was below average. . . For a great burger go to In N Out, Bin 38 or RN 74 in SF.
We made a reservation for our party of 6 at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill, as we were looking for some simple food prior to attending Absinthe, just outside Caesar's. . . The server was nice enough, although somewhat awkward and not detail-oriented. . . I should have looked at the menu more closely before choosing this restaurant, as there was not much on the menu that interested me. I ended up ordering the mini-pub burgers as my meal. They were OK. One of the girls had the scallops and really enjoyed those as well. But that was about it for the positives.. . One member of our party asked about the curry chicken, which the server said was very good. She probed as to how hot or spicy it was, and the server said it really wasn't at all. . . It took FOREVER for our meals to come, without any real update from our server. Finally, 5 of 6 meals came and the server didn't address the missing 6th meal. Finally, we caught his attention and asked what was going on. Apparently the kitchen missed the 6th order, which happened to be a steak so it was taking even longer to come out. After one bite of the curry chicken, our friend knew it was verrrryyy hot. The server mentioned it also came with a jelly to "cool the spices" and that was nowhere to be seen. She actually looked to be in pain trying to eat her meal.. . My husband had the grilled beef burger, and he said it was just OK. . . To top it off, our waiter put everything on one bill. We had a party of 6, very clearly 3 couples. He couldn't take the time to separate it onto 3 separate bills?. . I'm going to assume Gordon Ramsay doesn't spend muchtime checking in on the performance of this restaurant. We eat out a lot, and have rarely had an experience this poor. I honestly wish we would have just gone to the Cheesecake Factory!
Let's start off that in Caesar's Palace, there is no shortage of food options. Fine dining is as commonplace as a tourist with a spiked neon slushie in a foot-long container. That said... When we chose to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, it was calculated. We were all enthusiastic to eat at this scary, yet reputable chef's restaurant.. . But all went awry when 45 minutes after placing our order, our party was awaiting the APPETIZER.  And the most puzzling part was that the restaurant was damn near EMPTY at the time we ate. Where the dag nabbit was Ramsay with his inappropriate and oft mal-placed British curses and wrinkled forehead to scare the bejesus out of these chefs for a hustle on our order? 45 minutes on a meal in Vegas? You know what I missed? I missed the taxi cab that was going to take me to MGM to see Calvin Harris. Or... I might have missed the end results of the poker tournament at Rio. Or... At least 2 drinks with my cousins from out of  town.  In other words, time is money and in Vegas, time and money is currency. . . Ramsay, you have a 3-star pub and grill. And your name brought us despite the mediocre reviews. I still have a homoerotic man-crush on you, but the service  needs a firm kick in the pants.
A-OK, just like the rating is meant for.  Nothing special for what you're about to pay here.  It's not bad food either but it's just A-OK
Wow!!  This place has gone down hill!  The pretzels and cheese that used to be free are now $10 for three pretzel sticks. When we asked the server, Tayler, why they are now charging for bread he said " we are trying to run a business and people would come in, eat the free bread sticks and then leave".  I stated maybe they should give the bread after the order is put in. He stated "you know our rent is $250,000 per month".  My thought, you can't argue with stupid. They also removed the truffled fingerling potatoes, that was my favorite, from the menu. We ordered fish and chips and sliders. The fish and Chips were $30 and are only average. When some of us were done with our subpar meal the bus boy began removing plates and reaching right over my plate as I was still attempting to eat. I suggested to him that maybe he should wait until we are all done.   Tayler, in all his brilliance, decided to come over and tell us that the bus boy was the best they had, blah,blah, blah. In a nutshell Gordon Ramsay needs to bring kitchen nightmares in to his own place and Tayler, you need to learn that the customer is always right and to shut your stupid mouth.  Skip this place Vegas is full of top notch restaurants fantastic food and stellar service.
On the whole, this place is about 3 stars... the fish and chips however are 5 stars!   . . I got the fish and chips which were AMAZING.  The batter was perfect and the fish was fried perfectly.   The fries were medium sized and also delicious.. . We also got the scotch egg, bangers and mash, and sheperds pie at our table.  All of which were average (3 stars).. . Their beer selection is actually pretty weak although they did have Innis and Gunn on tap which is an amazing beer.   This being Vegas,  there are much cheaper places to drink so I would suggest just getting the 1 beer to go with your meal.   . . Prices were 9-13 dollars for largely mainstream and uninteresting beers.
