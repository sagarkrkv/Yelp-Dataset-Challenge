Such a great place for comfort food. The fried chicken is an excellent southern rendition and vibe is good. I always order the Lo Lo's, which is 3 pieces of chicken prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles... and it's plenty for me. The 'dranks' come in big mason jars are usually don't need to be refilled. It's a team service event and it's always on-point. Mama has done good!  Certainly going back.
Went with a group of twelve.  Six of us got our food after one hour.  The other six waited another 30 minutes for their food.  Everyone agreed the food was excellent, but the service was abominable.  The server never came over to ask if everything was OK.  It took three tries before they got my bill right.  Two other things we didn't like.  The original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms.  They have enlarged it, so the original ambiance is gone.  Also they had a DJ playing so loud that conversation was impossible.  Not likely I will return, even though the food is excellent.
Of course the food is good, there is something for everyone here. If you like good southern cooking, Soul food, then this is a place for you. Fried cat fish, Fried chicken, fried everything.
I am visiting family in Phoenix & they told me about Lo-Lo's.   So I read the reviews here on Yelp first like any good Yelp'r should & I was a little disappointed because I was expecting greatness & it was just good.  I would say a little better than Roscoe's (in L.A.) but not by much.   I've been to other restaurants that use Mason jars... so no big deal. The waffle was definitely good.  The smothered fried chicken was not bad but nothing great about it either...probably because it was luke warm nearing cold.  I ordered the Catfish Beignets as an appetizer expecting that something different...we'll they didn't come out as an appetizer but as a side order with my meal & they were just catfish strips.  I think it gets such great reviews because of the lack of competition.   . 45 minute wait (actually about 30) if you don't want to sit outside.  There's an outside waiting area adjacent to the outdoor dining which is a little confusing.  I'm told the place had really grown, & it does look great.   But at the end of it all... it's just good NOT GREAT!!!
The breakfast was delicious.
Do not bother and here is why.  I have worked in restaurants back in the day in the south and have won a few contests for recipes so i feel relatively qualified to give a review about this.. . Here's what was good:  the service was good and wait staff friendly.  Portions were large.. . Here's what was wrong:. . 1.  Chicken breast was over cooked (dry) and way under-seasoned. This being their main product, it should have been really good.  Big disappointment.. . 2.  Waffle was not at all crispy nor very warm (chicken was plenty hot though).. . 3.  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe (pink).  You do not make fried green tomatoes with semi-ripe tomatoes.  They taste different and the texture of the tomato comes out mushy if not green.  . . 4.  Tea is a Southern soul food staple, however Phoenix water is crappy and the water there is not filtered.  You can definitely tell this in the tea. . . 5.  Sort of expensive considering.. . We also had cornbread and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about.. . What i am saying here is this is an approximation of Southern soul food but it ain't the real deal.  It came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients.  . . Jennifer B.
Fantastic chicken and waffles! Cornbread was perfect and the koolaid was just like as a kid! Fun atmosphere and good value! Would go back!
I came here with a girlfriend and were told the wait would be 45 min.  . . We left for 30 min and came back only to find that we had missed them calling us. AH!. . We let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).. . I did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their "drinks" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.. . I ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  . . The Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. . . We were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  . . The Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.. . We also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it wasBAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.  . . I will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.. . Our waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.. . Normally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)
If you come to AZ you NEED to come to lo-lo's chicken and waffles. The best fried chicken and the best waffles. It also comes with cool aid. Only problem is that it is about a 1-2 hour wait.
Love the fried chicken!! It's cooked just right and with the tasty waffle with a hint of cinnamon mmmmm. I always get the Betty Boob with some kool-aid and today it's grape flavor. Not only is the food amazing but the employees are courteous and friendly.  Can't wait for their Gilbert location to open up, closer to home.
Found this place on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. . . I tried the chicken fried steak and it was awesome. My sides were mac & cheese and waffle. Bothwere delicious. Amazing thing was they offered Kool Aid, several flavors. Have never had that at a restaurant, just as a kid at home. . . Overall this place was great and friendly.
Great service - thanks Jamal & AJ! Great atmosphere and love the 90s & 2000s hip hop music!!! Waffle was good, fried chic was very good, corn bread muffin was huge but could be a touch sweeter and it was a little dry, and the sweet tea is definitely southern sweet! The greens were spicy!! Overall enjoyed it!
By far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The Kool-aid in a mason jar and fried pickles appetizer really made it a unique and tasty dinner.
