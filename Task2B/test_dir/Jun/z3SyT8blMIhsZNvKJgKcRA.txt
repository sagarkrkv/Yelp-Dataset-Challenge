I like it here coz i won some money at the 1cent slot machine.. . And they have a Sex and the City slot machine that's like super entertaining.. . And because it's still nice and huge and i know it's been on the strip for years.. . And the shops.. You gotta love the shops.. . Oh. location is prime.
Ok so I really wanted to love Caesars... and my experience here was not bad. In fact, the guy who checked us in was very friendly and actually upgraded our room . However, I was with a large group of ladies attending a conference, so we had several different rooms and everyone checking in separately . One member of our party was the last to arrive and was given a smoking room when she asked for a non smoking room . She went back down to talk to the people in the front desk and they told her that it was " too bad" and a non smoking room was not guaranteed . She explained how she could not be in a smoking room because of her eyes, nose , throat etc. and asked to speak to a manager . The guy replies " there's no one here higher than me ." Needless to say, after over an hour of arguing, they did finally move her . All our party was on the 5th floor with spacious rooms and a spa tub . She was given a tiny room in a completely separate tower on the 59th floor with only a shower- no spa tub . Also, upon arrival she noticed the phone in the room did not work - nice way to avoid a complaint to the front desk huh ?!. . Unfortunately, it doesn't end there . We attended the last day of our conference , which was IN Caesars and ended at 12. We all asked for a late check out . Everything went smoothly for everyone -except our person in floor 59! She went up to the separate tower to floor 59 to find that they had reset her key. She had to go all the way back down to the front desk and have them reissue a room key ! . . It's such a sad day when a place whose whole existence is due to customer service and they can treat people so horribly !
I never stayed here but I have tried their spa and I must say it's really nice and love love love their spa area. It's cleaned and once your in there you feel like your in a different world then Vegas. I highly recommend this Spa to anyone!!!
My stay at the Vegas Caesars Palace , excellent venue Beautiful in fact , the architecture in this hotel and casino is breath taking , the rooms are also very nice of high class scale I've been in better but the room i was in was top of the line , the service was good considering the long wait time it toke to get my room ready , 3hrs , and the buffet the food was very good but also very pricey $162. for three and they did not accept my $120. food comp not a good way to do business the service was very poor , no greeting and no smile , and i was told i didn't have to wait because i am a VIP but was told this after we waited 2 hrs , and it seemed that all the personal where reading out of the same book of rudeness as if they hated their job . I did meet a very nice young lady in one of the shops going to my room she had a perfect attitude so on my way out at check out time i bought a small bust of Apollo very nice ladies working in this shop , the parking is in the back and a long way to walk but beauty is every where , i did enjoy my stay three nights of exploring .
Never again. My room was filthy; there was a earplug on the floor, mold in the shower a black mark on the sheet and a rip in another sheet. The floor behind the bathroom door was dirty and had hair that was not mine which I found out when the shower leaked literally all over floor and I had to clean it up. The ironing board wouldn't stand up, the alarm clock went off at 6:30 am and I realized while I was trying to turn it off that it was filthy. Housekeeping was nice on the phone and replaced the ironing board and alarm clock but nothing else was cleaned or fixed. They nickel and dime for everything, if you pick something up from the mini bar for more than 20 seconds you get charged. There is a soda machine on the floor but it wasn't working. In order to get to the Palace Tower you have run a gamut of shops with very aggressive sales clerks standing in the doorways calling out invitations to come see their goods, reminds me of TIjuana. I left a nightgown hanging in the bathroom when I checked never to be found again. Housekeeping theft at Caesars?! Wow, it really has lost all its class. If I could give it negative stars I would.
This hotel is huge (just like other hotels on the strip). We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite in the palace towers that had a view of the pool. The bathrooms are clean and the beds are SUPER comfy. Lots of high end complimentary toiletries from the spa. Location is centrally located. The hotel is across the street from Bellagio and the Cromwell hotel. We were also allowed to do a 4pm late checkout! Hotel stadd is very attentive and professional and made sure we enjoyed out stay. Will be coming back here again the future! Just wished that they had more slot machines!
The rooms are great.. The casino is great.. The buffet is worth the price.. The spa is exceptional.. . What I still never got an answer about was the over $900.00 in credit card authorizations that were on my card for over 5 days. We checked out 06/06/14 and I still have one authorization on my card. I am continually told that "it will drop off", "there is nothing we can do about it now", "oh, I am not certain how that came to be.". Our room was comp'd and yes, I understand the original authorization for $200.00 for incidentals and the $28.00 daily resort fee. They were in crazy individual amounts ($134.95, $21.25, etc.). . Same thing happened when we dined in Mesa in this hotel on 06/05/14. We charged our dinner, which was $194.00 before tip. Our bill with tip came to $244.00. Our card was authorized for both amount. The charge of $244.00 was officially charged to our card on 06/09/14. . . As of this morning, the hotel authorization and the mesa grill authorization (for $194.00) are still on my card.. . Really? No one in a multi-billion dollar establishment can explain this to me? Not the front desk, the VIP front desk or the accounting office?. . I say again...really?
Jonathon the "manager" who was early 20's at best had a real attitude.  Lied to us on check in about our room.  Even called security although we were calm and he wasn't.  Hmm. . Not ever would we come back.
There was a new problem daily with my room 1 day a flooded bathroom floor in the morning and the jetted tub spewing out a hairball and stopping in the same eve. The hotel continued to charge me $200/nite and refused to discount my stay. I will never stay here again or book a client. Their is No Hospitality here!
Internet didn't work. Walls are paper thin. guest services checked us out without asking despite a promise for late checkout. Pretty shitty hotel experience despite it's reputation
Gorgeous casino! I cant wait to go back! Beautiful statues and architecture...and who doesn't love the huge mall inside with the sky ceilling!
Went to the pool, as a local and someone working in hospitality im appalled by the lack of service. Waited 20 mins before seeing a cocktail waitress and she said she was going home. After another 25 minutes we had to flag down a server to order a bottle of water and soda. Its almost 7pm and still no drinks. I hope they dont charge the room for something i didnt receive. It wasnt too hot today but if it was july/aug i wouldve died from dehydration by now. This is suppose to be the flagship property of Caesars Entertainment?
Do NOT EVER consider staying at one of the Caesar's Entertainment properties. If you are injured and it is their fault, they turn you over to CCMSI which is their 3rd party adjuster and they NEVER have any intention of repaying you for your costs associated with the injury. My grandmother, my mom, myself and two others stayed in a suite at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas from June 18 to June 22, 2012.. . The morning we were to leave, my 84 year old grandmother entered the restroom and fell into the wall hitting her head. There was water totally covering the floor due to a cracked toilet. She had out of pocketexpenses associated with her testing and follow up care. There is a two year statute of limitations to recoup your expenses. She and my mom talked with the claim adjuster on a regular basis. Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. (CCMSI) first adjuster was Joy Van Riper. She was replaced by Doug Buchanan in 2014. Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.. . We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.. . Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, "That's my job." Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.. . We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.. . So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.. . PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country. Please help spread the word about them taking advantage of the elderly and defrauding the U S Government through Medicare fraud. We will not rest until there is justice for my grandmother.
Requested a fountain view room in the Augustus tower 6 months in advance and still didn't get it. Currently looking at a bunch of run down buildings inside Caesars. Disappointing to say the least...your "checking in" system for first come first serve views is ABSURD. I can request a view 6 months out but someone who books yesterday and "checks in" before me can get it the same way? That's ridiculous.. . Edit after stay- bath tub blowers were broke as well as a lamp switch that didn't allow one of the bigger lamps to light. . Also was unaware that the resort fee doesn't include wifi as we were tried to be charged $15 per day for wifi! This was free for us when we stayed at the Cosmo 2 days prior to this stay. We'll definitely just be staying at the Cosmo for our whole trip next year.
Caesars palace is a Las Vegas icon. It is a true Las Vegas Mega Resort. You can spend your entire vacation at Caesars Palace and never run out of things to do. Still one of the best casino/hotel in Las Vegas Caesars Palace offers unlimited entertainment opportunities.. . The property consists of Nightclubs, Bars, Lounges, restaurants, shopping, gambling, conventions areas, concerts, shows, and much more. There is a beautiful pool area and there is the Qua Spa. The casino is huge and the staff is very friendly. The suites are amazing and they have nice views of the strip. The Nobu tower is a recent addition to the property.. . Everyone should stay here at least once. You will definitely enjoy your stay.
Overall this is now my favorite hotel in Vegas for several reasons.   Location, price, room, and spa.   We enjoyed our stay and will be back in Aug 2014.  Room was clean and great view of strip.  Central location you can walk right on to the strip.  Hugh spa very relaxing, and decent price for room we got.
SO disappointed in Caesar's Palace this trip!. . Our trip was going really well, until one morning! We had spent the night gambling, so we didn't wake up for awhile the next day. When we did wake up, we heard strange noises in our bathroom! I got out of bed to realize, THERE HAD BEEN BLACK GUNK AND GOO SPLATTERING OUT OF THE DRAIN FROM OUR SINK! talk about disgusting! We hurried to remove our things from the area before it had splattered onto our tooth brushes and toiletries! There was BLACK WATER AND HAIR THAT CAME FROM THE DRAIN OF THE SINK!. . SO disappointed in what happened next.. . We called the  front desk to let them know what was going on, and they told us that they would be sending up a mechanic right away! He told us that he had been unclogging the drain from a different tower, which is why stuff was coming up from our sink. He unclogged our sink, then called someone to come and sanitize the sinks. As he left, he asked us if it was okay to move the do not disturb sign from the outside of the room, to the inside of the room, which we agreed to! He told us that if we left that on, housekeeping would probably ignore us.. . By then, we just wanted to take showers, get ready to enjoy our vacation....but 20 minutes later, noone came by.....so we called front desk, and they said they put a rush on it........ another 20 minutes went by...noone came by... THE PERSON ON THE PHONE SAID "YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN THE ROOM" yeah... WE COULDNT EVEN GET READY. WHAT DO THEY EXPECT? US TO WALK AROUND UNWASHED AND UNCLEAN? they might do that on their spare time, but we don't enjoy doing that!! . . . . so we called the front desk and they said after the rush, it usually takes 30 minutes....so we waited 15 minutes, then called back again. . . By then, we were so frustrated because we just wanted to go out on our vacation! We asked to speak with a manager, which she said would call us later tonight, we asked to speak with a supervisor, they were on the phone. SEEMED LIKE ALL THE MANAGEMENT WAS BUSY. Some more time went by, and we were just extremely frustrated. The only reason why I got off the phone was because they had told me that the someone was coming directly to the room. I specifically asked, "SO YOU'RE SAYING, SOMEONE IS COMING DIRECTLY TO OUR ROOM TO SANITIZE THE MESS?" she said yes. it might take a few minutes to go up the elevator, but someone is coming right away" GUESS WHAT. THEY DID NOT. . . WE GO TO CAESAR'S PALACE BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEND HOTELS, BUT CLEARLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.. . I called front desk again, and finally got to speak with a manager. She told me "there should be a housekeeper knocking on your door right now." nope...no one knocked....She told me that she would call back in 5 minutes to make sure someone came. We heard someone outside our door, and we saw it was the manager of housekeeping. SHE TOLD US THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL SHE HAD GOTTEN. we literally called housekeeping 5 times, and she tells me that it was the first call she got. are you serious?! . . The manager called back and said the reason why noone came earlier was because there was a do not disturb sign on the door. ARE YOU SERIOUS!? i told her the mechanic specifically told us to take out off, and he was the one that moved it into the inside of our room.... and she said "the housekeeper said that there was one there, which is why noone came." ARE YOU SERIOUSSSSSS WHAT A LIEEEEEE. if you're going to lie to save yourself, you should at least have a reasonable lie. . This manager was SUCH a joke!!!. . I asked her, why did someone tell us someone was coming right away but noone came? She said "i don't have an answer for that. I can't tell you why noone came". . I asked her if she was blaming us for noone coming because of the do not disturb sign that was not hanging outside? she said "No I am not. That's not what I'm trying to say." Okay...then why did you say your housekeeper said it was there when it wasnt?". . I asked her why the housekeeping manager had said this was the first call when it should have  been the 5th call. She said "the Housekeeping manager is wrong and she had no idea what she was talking about". OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT BEEN CALLED.. . This manager offered us 50$ food credit to caesars. WHAT A JOKE. 50$ WAS NOT WORTH WASTING OUR VACATION JUST SITTING AROUND OUR HOTEL ROOM BEING GROSS, HUNGRY, AND DIRTY! she then offered us 75$. I wanted to tell her to shove it. Have you seen the prices for Caesar's food? LIKE HAVE YOU? WHAT A JOKE. this alsjfl;sakdjfla;skdjfl;kj this hotel has now become a joke to me. . . . . I'll be applying for an M Card now. Thanks but no thanks.. . . ALSO,  the floor we were on was nonsmoking, but our room reeked of smoke, and even had an ash tray sitting on the table...nonsmoking my ass...
Holly crap Cesar would roll over in his grave if he knew what kind of motel in Las Vegas has his name on it. . . I did not think twice about booking a room here due to the reputation, location, and of course The Hangover. I was appalled to discover how disgusting the rooms were. I am not even exaggerating when I say that you would find higher cleaning standards at a Motel 6. This place made The Excalibur seem royal. . . We switched rooms three times because of the lack of cleanliness. Missing sheets, dirty everything, when we had to pick up the phone to call the front desk it was covered in some kind of gunk. They really need to get their act together.
So surprised about the quality of this hotel! Stayed at many of the top Vegas hotels and wanted to try Caesars. Based on the price we paid and Caesars reputation, I was expecting to treat myself to luxury. Instead I got a clogged shower, no shower pressure, and $8 coffees with no coffee maker in my room.  The rooms need to be updated, felt so old and grungy. I agree with one of the reviews that a Motel 6 would be cleaner. I forgot my makeup remover towelettes and used their washcloth to remove my makeup, ended up getting pink eye! One evening, we requested directions from one of the employees to a restaurant. They gave us the wrong directions, and we wasted over an hour getting back to the right location. When I notified management of the person I spoke to, they said it was not their problem because it wasn't their employee, but a person who rented space from them. Super long check in line, and a couple people just cut in front of me. When I asked about this, I was just brushed off. Obviously they have severe plumbing problems based on reviews I see as I'm writing this one. When I complained about the clogged shower and lack of water pressure, their response of course was: "We've never had a complaint like that before"    Won't be going back there for sure!
Pessoal, passei uma semana nesse hotel, simplesmente fantastico!!! Como minha viagem para Vegas era para assistir o show da minha diva Celine Dion, nada como ficar no hotel onde ela se hospeda e onde respira-se Celine. . O Hotel e um encanto, enorme, o teto dele muda de acordo com o tempo la fora, ou seja, se esta de noite, o teto fica escuro com estrelas, se esta de dia, fica azul clarinho com nuvens. . As lojas dentro do hotel sao otimas!!! Os restaurantes que ficam no hotel tem para todos os gostos, desde lanches rapidos ate maravilhosos jantares. Confesso que a recepcao do hotel nao foi a das melhores, pois no dia em que cheguei com a minha irma a atendente nao estava muito de bom humor e foi um pouco rispida conosco, mas logo depois o humor dela melhorou (do nada, vai entender) e correu tudo bem. Ai ai ai o que falar de um belo quarto, com duas entradas para o banheiro GIGANTE do quarto? Nesse banheiro tudo era duplo, duas pias, dois chuveiros, dois vasos sanitarios (em comodos reservados) varios espelhos etc...uma banheira enorme e um monte de toalhas...Sem contar os cremes, shampoo, condicionador e outros "brindes" que o quarto fornecia. A vista era incrivel, dava para ver boa parte de Vegas da janela do quarto, alem de ter um amplo espaco para DUAS CAMAS KING, poltronas, escrivaninha, tv, ar condicionado, armario e tudo entapetado, como ja e de costume nos EUA. Alem de tudo isso, voce ainda tem uma otima localizacao, bem como piscinas e varios tipos e tamanhos...alem e claro dos casinos que o Caesars Palace oferece!!! E nao poderia deixar de falar que como a Celine faz show e esta hospedada nesse hotel, como disse acima, a musica ambiente e toda dela, salvo em alguns lugares do casino, sem contar na loja dela, com um monte de coisa que voce so encontra la!!! E o show dessa mulher gente, foi emocionante, fico emocionada so de pensar. Bom, e isso pessoal, recomendo muito ficarem no Caesars Palace, NAO TEM NADA DE RUIM LA, VOCES VAO AMAR TUDO!!!!
