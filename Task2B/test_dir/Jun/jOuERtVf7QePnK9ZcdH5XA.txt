Great exprince
Don't go!. Two of us went for dinner.  The first sign of trouble was so many different staff came by the table we were never quite sure who our waiter was.  Someone took the drink order; a different person took the food order.  Every single item was brought to the table by a different person.  You might think this would make it a very fast and efficient, but no.  I ordered the cream of chicken soup and a small chopped salad.  My partner ordered the smoked salmon platter.  We each had a drink.  When the food arrived the smoked salmon platter did not have a bagel as it should have.  I tried to flag down our waiter or any waiter and it was next to impossible.  Finally our(?) waiter arrived and we explained the problem.  Fifteen minutes later still no bagel and no sign of our waiter.  I got the attention of another waiter and explained the problem.  Ten minutes pass and no bagel and no waiter.  By now I'm getting agitated.  I manager comes over and I explain the problem of the missing bagel and missing waiter.  I also stated that I didn't think we should have to pay for the platter since we have now been there for over an hour.  He went to the kitchen to check.  The waiter then appeared and said the kitchen had no bagels but the manager was taking care of things. (No offer to reorder just more waiting).  Finally two hard as a rock bagels arrive.  As a "courtesy" the manager removed the charge for the $5.00 soup.(How generous)  We never saw him again.  The whole affair, from arriving at the table to check arrival takes nearly two hours! You bet I paid in cash so as not to have to wait for my credit card to come back.  I think the waiter tried his best.  The problem here seems to be TOTAL lack of management and total chaos in the kitchen.  It was 8:00pm and the place was half empty. The looked to be more than ample wait staff. Two hours for soup, salad and a lox platter???!!!. This place is totally mismanaged. The food wasn't even up to the usual Grand Lux standards. Stay away.
My wife and I visited Vegas for vacation and found that this is the best food on the strip. The meals were large enough to share and I usually never share a meal because I can eat a lot. The food was fantastic and the service was great, we never had to wait to get in, get are food, or wait for the check. My wife and I loved this place so much we eat there everyday of our 3 day vacation. This place was also worth the price and the price wasn't that bad either. We shared the Chicken Parmesan and we paid about $19.00 without the tip and for breakfast we shared the pancakes and sausage for $15.00(also without tip). I would highly recommend this place to eat!
Food : great. Prices: reasonable. Customer service: almost left the restaurant because food took forever. Our waiter was awful!
I love grand lux. I never had a item on the menu I didn't like. Came here late late night and they were out of bread. The waitress brought us a order of fries to substitute. Try the cream of chicken soup. You'll thank me for it
As a gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian it's a rare occasion where I can have a delicious veggie burger WITH a bun. So tasty!!! They even put beets in it so it looks like a real burger. GENIUS. Loved it all. Well done :)
This restaurant has never fail on my Dinner every time I go  with my family the food is always delicious and a great experience  . I'm very happy with Yesterday Dinner was Delicious . The restaurant was very clean . The host,waitress ,and the rest of the staff was very nice specially a Spanish speaker man he took care of Us and made sure we had everything we needed
So good!!!!!!! Very Cheesecake Factory-esque.
I really didn't enjoy my meal or service here, but am giving it an extra star because I think it was a fluke.  We sat in the bar area and the service was painstakingly slow--which can kill a vibe ifyou are just starting your day.  We ordered one burger and a round of drinks and it took forever...so long it almost ruined our vibe...almost...but then it didn't...because let's face it, we are in Vegas!  On to another bar and can't decide if I'll be back.  It's got the makings of a positive lunch experience, so I might be able to forgive the over-cooked burger and slow service.  I'll let you know.
I absolutely love this place. The staff is great very knowledgeable when it comes to suggesting food you will love. You can feel that they know what taste good. The wine pairings are exquisite. The manager is so accommodating  he makes you feel very special. His an awesome guy. When we ate there I heard that he was having a health issue but he made us feel like royalties.there was no way you can tell he was dealing with something ,I wish everyone is like that ,willing to do their work inspite  of anything. Your the best.i will definitely come to enjoy the food and hang out with you. . Love your pastas and bread.
Love this place. Food is always amazing and the service is great. They have great salads and portions are gigantic. Just avoid going here on weekends in the wee hours because you'll be surrounded by drunk, half naked girls and douchy guys that just got out of the clubs. Unless you want to see girls walking around shoeless and guys fist pumping to imaginary bass sounds.
Went back last summer and it was epic! Everything we ordered was so delicious. You must try the Madiera Chicken!!! My mouth is watering just typing it's name. Shrimp with avacado salad and Asian Nachos also both good. Our waitress was first class, top notch. She was extremely friendly and great with suggestions.
I rate this above the Cheese Cake Factory, by 1 star do to better menu. Over 200 items VERY KID FRIENDLY for being hirer end. I had the 7 mushroom burger got 12.00 and was so dam tasty!! There was 8 if us including 4 kids. Kid menu was the only down fall it was short but food was still to at 8.00 per plate. All the staff were 5 star with our drinks never hitting the bottom. We will be back . Total bill w drinks deserts and food for 8 was 171.00 w tip. Good deal for what you get!
The food was great!  . Our waitress was very occupied though, because I had to ask another waitress twice to get her. . We ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and they were delicious!  Crisp, hot and very good flavor.. Then I got the pasta and salad lunch portion.  My pasta was very good. I ordered the Carbonara. A little too much peas for me, but after I picked a few off the top, it was good. . The salad was a small portion of greens on the side, but was perfect since the appetizer filled me up. . I also ordered a Blanco Sangria and it was just a 3 out of 5.  Drinkable, but wouldn't order again.  . I really enjoyed the food, so I am still giving this a 5 regardless of the drink and service. . I will return.
We came here for breakfast and thought it was a great place to eat.  Had the chicken and waffles with maple pecan butter and my wife had a scrambled eggs plate.  Everything was very flavorful and the service was good.  The place is slightly dark but looks a place you want to eat at.  It does cost a little more than breakfast should but eating on the strip always cost a little more.  Wish we came back for lunch to see what other good stuff they had to offer.
I've been here several times for dine in and take out whenever I'm playing poker here.  They have an extensive menu.  Offers something for everyone.  Today I had the chile lime chicken mango salad and the chef made me a custom dressing which was fantastic.  Sorry I forgot to take a photo.  The bread was good also.
I don't recommend this place to anyone. Me and my friends came here because it was one of the the only restaurants that open for 24 hours. I had crispy caramel chicken. Unfortunately, it was poor quality. The staff was friendly; however, it wasn't worth it.
I love this place and the fact that it's open 24 hours. This is my ultimate favorite 24 hour spot. Delish food at any hour! They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner and the portions are huge and good priced. They also have lunch specials till 5pm. They are the same company as Cheesecake Factory and offer similar dishes. I took off one star however, because the last three times I was here, the food took FOREVER to come out even though it wasn't busy. They apologized each time but three times in a row? Not good. . On to food! My favorites are the Avocado Chipotle Burger, Short Rib Grilled Cheese, Pasta Carbonara, Indochine Shrimp and Chicken, Chicken Royale, Pan Seared Salmon, and Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding. I feel like I've tried probably half their menu and haven't come across something I haven't liked. I love this place! Definitely one of my favorites!
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This place is nothing special and the menu choices are almost identical to the Cheesecake Factory's. With all the other amazing food options in the area, why dine at a high-volume food chain?
I've been to the location in Chicago so when it came time to pick a place to eat for lunch we decided to go here - mainly because we were already nearby and the menu looked good.. . There was no wait and hardly anyone in the restaurant but service was sooo slow and our waitress seemed to be in la la land. We asked for water 3 times before she finally decided to bring it and then she just left us there for a good 15 minutes even though we told her we were ready to order when she brought the water. . . We finally order and the food takes forever to arrive. By this time, we've gone through 2 bread baskets and our water but she doesn't come back to fill the water, just brings another one and doesn't answer our question about where the food is. . . When the food finally arrived it was just ok. My friend got the waffles and I got the southwest enchiladas. It all looked good but the portions were huge and the food lacked flavor. We got through about half of it before deciding we were done and once we decided on that, the check took forever to arrive. *sigh*
Been coming here for the past few years always a must! Everything is always delicious, the staff is great. We always come for the buffalo rolls/balls and the Cesar salad is our favorite. Great quality food and quick service.
3.5 stars.. . I constantly stay at the Venetian/Palazzo when I'm visiting Vegas so this has become one of my go-to places. It's convenient (right by the elevators to the suites), it's tasty, and it's open 24 hours. It really can't get any better than that!. . I probably go to Vegas around once or twice a year so I rarely get to eat at Grand Lux (it's LA location unfortunately closed). Therefore, I always order the same thing when I go, which is the Pasta Telephono. I absolutely love it. It's got a nice tomato sauce, with melted cheese and bread crumbs on top. You can get the lunch portion which comes with a side salad ($12.95), but they only serve this until 5pm. The dinner portion costs $16.95. Kinda pricey for a pasta that doesn't even come with any meat. Adding chicken will cost you an additional $2, and they actually charge you per shrimp if you want to add that! I've never heard of a restaurant doing that before!. . Anyways, I can't really comment much on their other dishes. I've tried a few others before and didn't have any complaints. They have a huge menu, including sandwiches/burgers, pizzas, and fried chicken, so you're bound to find something you like. It's very similar to Cheesecake Factory.
Awesome food here! Late night is A-May-Zing!!!!! Try the asian nachos it won't disappoint. Also the buffalo chicken rolls!
I love staying at the Palazzo in Vegas, and the two times I have stayed (both for my birthday), I have eaten at the Grand Lux Cafe.. . Their food is delicious and enjoyable every time!. Their fettuccini alfredo is pretty bomb & so are their buffalo chicken rolls and cream of chicken soup!. . Never disappoints! Also, don't be fooled by the long lines, especially if you are a small party, just go and sit at the bar! There is almost always bar spots available to eat, despite people wanting to sit at regular tables, and I honestly feel like the bartenders are more attentive anyways!. . Pricing here is slightly above average, but nothing mediocre. You are looking at $10-$25 plates.. . Love this place! Can't wait til our next visit and meal here!
This is a great place if you have a large group of people.  Their menu has an incredible amount of variety.  The food is great.  The service is good.  And the portions are terrific.  And for dining on The Strip, you can't beat the price.  Whenever I'm entertaining a large group of people, I recommend this place for those reasons.  They have one in the Venetian and one in the Palazzon.  The one in the Venetian is 24/7.
The restaurant was amazing. The food was great and the service was very quick. I ate a full slab of 12 ribs and I wasn't very hungry. First time coming here and will definitely add it to the list. Pricing was normal but the server didn't really know much of the pricing. Overall I would recommend it to anyone ! No wait and great food, open late too!
As far as Grand Luxe's go this one was  very good. . . We came as a party of 8 on a Sat night and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, not too bad. The waiter came over promptly after we were seated and brought over some water and warm bread. Our orders were taken but then the waiting game began. It took over 30 mins for us to get our food. No one ordered anything too fancy (salads, pasta, salmon, etc) but we watched as tables around us that were seated after us got their food, ate, paid and left. . . Everyone was very satisfied with their food though so I have to still give Grand Luxe credit. My chicken and avocado salad was very good: a large portion, lots of avocado, flavorful salad dressing. Other orders included the cedar planked salmon (always a crowd pleaser, my friend enjoyed it very much), the fried chicken, the gnocchi and pesto, spicy beef, and garlic shrimp pasta. No complaints about the food, the wait to get it was a doosy though.
24 hour cafe downstairs, awesome! Grand Lux is known to be the sister of Cheesecake factory so you'll see similarities in their decor and menu options. . . I tried their Pasta Carbonara during this trip and it was the best Carbonara that I've ever had. It was creamy and just delicious! Their Asian nachos are also on point. They're a little on the sweet side for me but my boyfriend absolutely loves them.   . . Service has always been awesome. They have a grand selection of options to try. Next time I'll try their breakfast options if I stay at the Venetian again.
