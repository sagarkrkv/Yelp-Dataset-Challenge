My husband and I were on a date last 5/31/2014 night at the Windmill location. It took 20 minutes to get our burgers and the veggie gyoza and fries never came. When we got our burgers, I asked them to please get our appetizer (which is supposed to come before the meal) and our order of fries. Not only was it late, but it turned out neither were ever prepared. I told our server, I think her name was Ashley, to cancel the veggie gyoza appetizer, and she rushed to the kitchen I assume to communicate it to the cook. 5 minutes later, someone from the kitchen came out with them wrapped in a to-go box. I had to repeat that I already cancelled that order. (Another communication breakdown or  one that didn't happen?) At this point I was exasperated. My husband who had already finished his burger, was still waiting for his fries (dessert?). I asked him if he still wanted it after a server said: "two minutes." He looked so disgusted that I just asked them to cancel the order. The manager came out with repeated empty apologies, but didn't offer to make it right. If you're a manager and you want your patrons to come back, shouldn't you try to make it right???!!! Instead of offering to comp one of our drinks, she continued to repeat her apologies. THESE EMPTY and REPEATED APOLOGIES irritated me. I'm from Hawaii and so are the owners. There is something called customer service, but I expected more of a Kama'aina service here. People are human and mistakes are made, but make it right. Their mistake in our order irritated me, but it happens. HOWEVER, their failure to make it right is downright disgusting and offending.
I am not a huge burger fan-- but I love Bachi Burger! Prior to our Vegas trip, I made the suggestion to my boyfriend. And after extensive research (not really-- we just looked at Yelp photos), we opted for Bachi Burger over Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. We went right before they opened, so no wait! . . We were seated immediately and ordered some beers. My boyfriend ordered a Guinness on draft and I ordered a White Ale. The White Ale was very light and tasted similar to that of a Blue Moon. . . Now onto the food! We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries since it seemed like a popular choice-- and it was amazing! The oxtail chili, jalapenos, garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of a bed of French fries made for a delicious starter. My boyfriend ordered the famous shogun burger and I, the Miyagi grass fed burger. My boyfriend loved his savory burger which included unagi (eel) and foie gras. My burger was nice and juicy-- both burgers made with beef wagyu and cooked medium rare. Perfection!. . In addition to the amazing food, we had a wonderful server. Great value for the food. Unfortunately, Bachi Burger is quite a drive off of the strip. Totally worth it but not feasible if your only mode of transportation is a taxi. . . We will definitely be back!
This place is really busy yet awesome. Came here on Sunday night and was seated in 25 minutes. . . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: this thing can feed 4 people, maybe even 6. This thing was massive. However, I thought it was just an average dish. The oxtail was there, but the taste wasn't.maybe I'm wrong, but it was too salty for my liking.. . Pork Buns: fatty and delicious! I don't think I even need their dipping sauce. The sauce that was in the bun was perfect. The pork was juicy and savory. . Miyagi-san grassfed wagyu burger: the patty itself was very succulent. The whole burger was amazeballs. Furakake is naturally salty, but it wasn't overpowering in this dish. Like I said, amazeballs.. . Overall, I would come back for the burgers and pork buns. Service was good. Just expect to wait around 20-30 minute wait during peak hours.
First impression last... Yes! Very much impressed first time we've tried this place. So glad we went before we move to Hawaii... Amazing burger selection and the different type os burger sauce are so refreshing; unique and super tasty. The truffle French fries is a winner.  Highly recommended!!!! Definitely will come back sometime again.
I came here because I heard so much about it being one of the best burger places in the US.  The wait was a bit long on a Sunday night (which surprised me).  Staff were very efficient seating people, and the service was great.  After a nice glass of wine, I tried the Mr. Ho burger (Hawaiian).  It was pretty good after you got over the purple (taro) bun, but the flavors did not wow. Next time I will try the Korean version. The sausages appetizer was interesting, and worthwhile if you want some extra meat.  I recommend skipping the salad (overpriced and pedestrian), and the truffle/parmesan fries.  The truffle gravy had no truffle taste, and actually made the French Fries soggy - I recommend the plain fries instead. Overall, the food was good, but not out-of this-world.  However, the bill was - $45 for a burger meal....only in LV!
Overrated. That's all I have to say. But I mean hey this is coming from a southern California girl who would choose to go to In N Out where I can get a burger with extra everything and grilled onions for just $1.75. Just sayin'.
I've come here a few times and I'm always extremely happy. The service is amazing and the whole crew, not just my server says thank you as I left. They paid close attention to details such as refills on my AMAZING plantation tea, everyone should try it. Now the food! I custom make a BBQ burger with bacon, cheddar, and onion rings. The bun is delicious and unique. The patty is big, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. And the rest is just as amazing. I would recommend Bachi Burger to anyone. They truly have the best burgers in town!
Food, outstanding service pretty good when they come around, but they need a bigger place to handle the traffic 20 minute wait turned into an hour I fell asleep waiting that sucked! But glad to see they are kickin  gourmet  burger ass!
Food is great. Service is great.Price is a little high but definitely worth it!We tried angus burger with fried egg and it was delicious!!we also tried sauted brussell sprouts for our appetizer and they were delicious also!. We will return again to experiment something new.if your into an Asian. Spin on burgers this place is gor you!
First time here and I've heard so many good things about it... so I had to try it out for myself! I ordered the Kiki burger (without bacon) and boy let me tell you..... That burger is soooo tasty and juicy! And it had mushrooms, which is another plus because I love mushrooms! MUST TRY! We also got the Miyagi, and that too was so yummy. I love the taste of the furikake on the onion rings! We also ordered calamari and I loved that they weren't stingy with the calamari, it was a big serving to share (there were 3 of us). I'm coming back, for sure! . . Our server was Chris. He's very nice, helpful.. And on it! Thank you!
Came here over the weekend during a trip to the strip for a Vegas Bachelor party and it was as good as the homie said. I got the Ronin burger and it was a fat juicy ass. BURGER! that got my appetite satisfied. Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg . Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli for $12. Not your normal McD's burger that's for sure. I wish they had this in the Bay cause I would come back more often. Only weird thing is after getting the check and pitching in to pay, we came out short $50...strange...maybe the group next to us enjoyed an extra free burger on us.
I have been craving Bachi since the first time I've had it which was over a year ago. . . First time, I had the Spicy Miso burger which was yummy. . . This time I ordered the Miyagi-san Wagyu burger. I ordered it medium, cut it in half, and the first half I had was amazing! Perfect flavors with the meat, onion rings, egg, and furikake. The second half, however, went from medium well to over cooked pretty much. Disappointing...how did they cook a single patty two ways? Ha eh...made my taste buds feel yucky. Wish I ate that cooked side first. But it was still good. . . Two other friends and I shared the Oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer. It turns out it was a good thing the fries came out way before the burgers because I don't think we would have finished it all if it didn't. They were so tasty! . . I'm definitely gonna come back next time I'm in Vegas. Hopefully next time my burger will be medium all the way.
I love this place I don't even know where to start I all ways go in without eating breakfast so I can fill up on the good stuff and omg there is so much to choose from the Thai tea is so good then I get the oxtail fries witch might I say are to die for  I all ways bring my friends in to they get different burgers so we can all share I love the burger buns talk about melt in your mouth And if you have kids mine get the BBQ burger and all ways clean there plate what more could I ask for its  such great food
We came on a weeknight, and there was a substantial wait to be seated. We sat at the bar, and again waited more than 20 minutes before the waitress came and took our order for drinks.  Once we were seated, we ordered oxtail fries appetizer. It was without a doubt outstanding.  We ate every last bite!  We ordered burgers and the pork belly sliders. Everything was outstanding and flavorful and delicious! The service staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and food came out quickly.
Another DDD stop! AND....Another repeater!. . WOW, top 5 burger I have ever had for sure! The truffle fries paired perfectly as well. I will definitely be back and this is a must stop.. . My burger came with bacon and mushrooms and they were cooked so well, I mean sooooo well. I had not eaten mushrooms cooked that way before and it was just perfection!
I would love to give bachi 5 stars.... However they lack a good manager. There's constantly issues that could be a simple fix yet it never happens. Over the last year there has been three different managers that I've seen and unfortunately they all lack being able run a restaurant. If I owned bachi, I'd be very disturbed with how it's ran. So, now newly remodeled, and has a bar that took up at least 30% of seating room... And doesn't serve food... There are some things with this place that may never make sense. But hey, they have a decent burger!
It was good. We felt rushed, but otherwise everything was tasty. The wait was nominal. The food looked exactly as pictured in the menu...that was a welcome surprise.
Bachi Burger has been on my list to go visit/eat in Vegas for a while now and since our family's timeshare is less than 10 mins away, we decided to stop by. We literally  just walked out of this place with my fiance and 2 young sons, one 8 and the other 3, and this is why....We saw how many people were waiting so we decided we'll just do takeout. It took a while for the hostess to even acknowledge us and when she did, she handed me the menu and told me we can order at the bar. Waited and waited...and waited for someone to finally greet me. Surprised how long it took given the fact there were so many waiters walking by, not even a hi/hello etc... FINALLY made eye contact with one of the three employees behind the bar BUT to only tell me that it'll be a 45 min wait for takeout the same as waiting to be seated! WTF is the point of takeout and on top of that, if that was the case someone (anyone) should've told us from the get and not have us wait around. No apology, no nothing! We ended up at McDonalds down the street and believe it or not, their customer service was 100xs better! So so so disappointed......
Ive been here 3 times already. This place is the best burger joint in the world.. I would eat here everyday but too bad I live in california. Everyone eat here!! It's clean, the staff is friendly, nice interior, and awesome food! Okay im going to eat my food now haha
Been hearing about this place a long time now so I went in to try it out, located just about couple blocks from my parents house this lil Asian burger joint is located In a lil strip mall. After seeing and hearing all the good things from people in the area and seeing it on triple d and hearing he's a local boy fro. Hawaii I had to try it. Sorry to say it was all hype. $10-14 for just a burger and it's all pretty much taste the same. Maybe if you haven't grown up around Asian food much this might appeal to you. It was just a lil all to familiar to me
Excellent choice, we had several burgers and ramen for 9 ppls. Also must try the bacon fried rice, was so good. Will come back here but avoid the long wait and come before 11:30 or peak hours.
We have been here several times in the past, food is always pretty good. . However the service is closer to poor. They take a longtime to greet you and take the order. Slow to get refills on drinks and seem like there running around in a panic. Maybe the service would be better when it's slow.
We came here because of DDD and I'm so so glad we did! One of the best burgers ever! I ordered the Mr. Ho's burger medium well ( the waitress recommended it to us, thanks a bunch 4 that)  and it was like heaven! :0 the buns were a purple, bluish color and so soft and Delish, and it was full of yummy flavor l just cant... I also had the Tai tea with bobas, the sweet potato fries, and dumpling appetizers! All were A++ I'm definitely stopping by here to try some other items from the menu next time we are in town!
I hadnever hear of this place, but it was close to our hotel in LV, and had a good Yelp rating. Apparently it was featured on a cable food show. My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday evening around 6. When we arrived, seating was available, but shortly after being seated, the place filled up and there was a line at the door. We ordered the Bachi Pickles, and found them delightful. My wife had the BBQ Bachi Angus burger, and I ordered the Ronin Burger. We split an order of Sweet Potato fries fixed in the Parmesan Truffle style.The food was served in an appropriate amount of time, and it was hot and delicious. The portions are quite large, but the food was so good we stuffed ourselves. . . Our server was friendly, competent and knowledgeable. Although the restaurant was full, and there were families and kids, the noise level was not overly loud. We were able to carry on a conversation without straining to hear each other. It was a very happy and fun experience, and we do plan to return when we are in Vegas again. Highly recommended.
We were visiting Vegas for a girls weekend and my roommate suggested this wonderful restaurant before catching our flight back to Colorado. Everything we had was delicious! We had the fried chicken, oxtail chili fries, ramen, kalbi burger, and a few other things to share with a table of 4. . The oxtail chili fries were surprisingly sweet but still had a good kick. The kalbi burger was bomb and I had to eat it the next day due to the ridiculous amount of food we ordered (still flipping delicious). . The ramen was good but not out of his world. Good hearty portion that hit the spot. . . It was so delicious that I returned to Vegas 2 weeks later with my boyfriend and requested that we eat here. I ordered the miyagi burger this time and it was amazing and definitely a good sized burger. Highly recommend and will return the next time I'm in Vegas! We were exhausted and hungry after driving 11 hours and there was no line and we were seated promptly.
Never wrote a review before but this place is so good I had to! The Oxtail chili cheese fries and a Kiki burger were the best! I've never been happier eating a restaurant burger. This place is a must if you're craving a burger in Vegas.
I took a friend to Bachi Burger, I've only been there one other time and I just had the oxtail fries (which is highly recommended). This time I ordered their truffle fries and their Kiki's burger. Their burgers are hand crafted just for you! Let's just say it was the best burger I've ever had! Also, Nick, our food server was The BEST! Very friendly! This is the spot! Can't wait to go back!
I heard about this place through triple D and since I was in the area, I thought I'd give it a try! Wow, am I glad I came here! The food was absolutely amazing and the worker staff was super friendly from the moment you walk in. . . The pork belly buns are a must if you get the chance to visit! They blew my mind and everyone else's who had the chance to try one! If you're looking for a savory burger, try the spicy miso burger, but if you're looking for something unique, try the Banh mi burger.
Best burgers in Las Vegas! The Miyagi Burger and Truffle Fries are a must! The customer service is always great.  There sometimes a wait... but it's well worth it!
This is the most amazing burger I have ever had!!!!!! We went twice in one week. And if I could eat burgers everyday I would eat baci burgers. It's so good that it's ok that it takes a little longer than most restaurants and there is usually a wait no matter what time of the day or what day of the week. Get there early before you are super hungry. But wow is it uniquely good :)
The first time I visited Bachi Burger, there was a 2+ hour wait around 7PM. We needed to head back to OC sooner than that on a Sunday evening, so unfortunately we didn't get to try it out until Cinco de Mayo/Fight Night weekend 2014. We went straight there upon arrival in Vegas around 10PM-11PM. My boyfriend was certain he spotted professional boxer Mickey Bey enjoying a post-fight burger.... . A couple of us ordered Hitachino beers imported from Japan. At $9 each, I could have done without it since the burger was actually pretty filling. But when in Rome/Vegas, right? The Real Ginger Brew was light and refreshing, but not the most outstanding ginger beer I've ever had. I'm just glad that it was 8% ABV.. . My boyfriend ordered Sweet Potato Fries $4.50 done Truffle Parmesean style for an extra $1. It was seasoned with sea salt and came with yuzu citrus aioli. He definitely couldn't finish them, so if you are very hungry it is a good value for an appetizer.. . He also ordered the Banh-Mi Burger $11, a Vietnamese-style burger. It definitely tasted the way a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich would taste in delicious, beefy, burger form.. . I ordered the Kiki's Burger $11 with a fried egg for an additional $1.50. I was very satisfied with this burger because it was a spicy and sweet tastebud party, but I could have done without the egg. Our server was talking it up, I feel like maybe he was just upselling me on the beer and the egg (tips for higher tax/tips haha). There was plenty of bacon, but of course I saved it for my last bite. I would definitely order this burger again, sans fried egg.. . The buns at Bachi Burger are extremely fluffy, but once you start eating it will flatten out. Overall, the food is delicious and made with good quality ingredients. I am looking forward to the next time I come to Vegas for another yummy, fluffy-bunned fusion burger!
My husband & I went here today for lunch. Very crowded, busy day waited 20 minutes for a table and 35 minutes to get our food. My husband ordered a burger with grilled onions, cheese. Burger came with raw onions not grilled, he was told by server that he needed to order caramelized onions. Plus the staff disagreed with him about grilled vs caramelized onions. I guess they've never heard the customers always right??? I ordered mixed seasonal salad with free range chicken. The salad came and it was arugula, radicchio, sliced carrots and 4 cubes of chicken with skin on it. When I questioned the server I was told can I get you anything else. The kitchens been slammed today. I said no just charge me for the side salad. Not worth the wait!!!!!!. If you have to wait then the food/kitchen service suffers......
This was my first time at Bachi Burger. I came around 5:50 with 3 of my friends, and the hostess said our wait was going to be around 25 minutes. We walked to the bar to wait, and less than 5 minutes later, we got seated! Awesome. . We got seated and our server introduced herself as Aubrey.. . I ordered the Bachi Fish and added grilled onions and roasted garlic. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries with added garlic and fried egg (because I can't get the oxtail fries - I don't eat meat). So I made my own version sans meat with drizzled chili garlic aioli lol. . . My friend Mike L ordered the Shogun Burger (with wagyu beef and unagi - $25 burger!) He really liked it and thought it was worth the amount he paid.. . My friend Stella K ordered the Spicy Miso Burger, which our waitress highly recommended as her favorite burger, and she added grilled onions. . . My friend Ritchie J ordered the Miyago, which he really liked too.. . When our food came out, our waitress Aubrey fucked up our order and brought two bachi fish burgers, when we only ordered one... My bachi fish burger had no garlic either, although I specifically said to add garlic. Once we were almost all done with our burgers, my friend's spicy miso burger came out... How could our waitress get her order wrong when she's the one who recommended the burger? ... Horrible service. We also ordered the pork buns, but when my friend's miso burger came out we asked where our pork buns were and she hadn't even placed the order!. . The food was good, but the service was shit. If I ever do go back to Bachi burger, I wouldn't go to this location.
One waiter was very rude. I didnt hear him ask for my plate so he hit the side of my arm to get my attention.
Not sure what the hype is about but they make good burgers. It's a bit expensive though the decor is nice.
Simple short review. You can't go wrong here.  You get what you pay for. Order different burgers and fries and share with friends.  . It's a popular place.  Be prepare to wait a bit.
The burgers were sooooo perfect. My friends and I came here and tried the ox tail fries, truffle fries, pork buns, kiki burger, miso burger, ronan burger and black and green burger. Allll so delicious!! From those burgers the miso and ronan was the best!! Also had the salt and Carmel milk shake. Service was quick and efficient.  Definitely coming back here again!!
Very unique burgers off the strip. It's very ironic but I usually only come here after late gym sessions since they're open late lol. I am very mixed with this place, there's some items I really love and some items that I really hated.. I really love the different options and burger combinations but some of them I feel are seasoned weird and kind of a mish mash of flavor. For example, I really didn't enjoy the crusty crab, black & green, or kalbi burger but I seriously LOVED the kiki and ronin burger. All of them were cooked perfectly and looked beautiful but something about those first 3 burger's seasonings were a little off to me.. Their truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries are alright, both of them are extremely overused in almost all specialty burger restaurants, and they didn't make them in any different way, so nothing special but still tastes good.. Their boba was also the worst I've had, very grainy with hard tapioca pearls, however their red velvet drink is quite amazing! . So as you can see, I'm very split, so three stars!
Whenever I go somewhere new, I look up DDD's in the area to try.  Bachi Burger came up, and even though I don't remember seeing them on the show, I wanted to try it.  . . It's a little confusing because there are more than one locations in the area. I went to this one, which I think(?) is the one that was on the show.  The location is in a nondescript strip mall.   I got the pork belly steamed bun appetizer and the bahn-mi burger.  The port belly buns were good.  Pro tip: be careful if you bite in to the bun, the strip of fat at the back of the pork will all come out as one chunk that you can't bite through.  Consider cutting it with a knife or eating the whole thing in one big bite.  It comes with a hoisin type sauce which is quite good. . . When I ordered the bahn mi burger, the waiter asked me if Medium was OK.  I asked for medium-rare at which point he warned me that the burger contains pork and shrimp, but they will make it medium rare if you want, so I did.. The burger was very good.  Portions appear small here but are quite filling.  It comes with fries which are also very good.. . Nothing knocked my socks off, hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  I think this place has the potential to be 5-star (perhaps I caught them on an off-day).  I would come back and try more entrees in the future if I come back to the Las Vegas area.. . My waiter was young but was on the ball and on top of things.  The waitstaff refilled my drinks competently.  There is a parking lot in the strip mall so no issues with parking.. . Pro tip: if you see Bachi from the road, you will be tempted to park on the wrong site.  The entrance is on the inner-side of the parking lot.  I parked and walked in but was on the wrong side of the restaurant and had to walk through it to get to the greeter station.
I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but something they did in the beginning irked me so much that I spoke about it even after we left.. The wait time was said to be 25 minutes for a party of 3. It ended up  being about an hour wait, but that wasn't the worst part. There was a party of 2 sitting at a table made for 3 or more... when there was a table for 2 that was open right next to them. So guess where they sat our party? Yes, they sat my party of 3 in the table made for 2 when they could have easily moved the party of 2, who just got their waters, to our table. It bugged me so much that I had to take a star away from them...  . . BUT the food made up for that silliness. . . "Kiki Burger" Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli (Got the info from their website) BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Everything about this burger was so right. The way the beef was cooked (order it medium, it's the best that way) down to how the buns were toasted. The mixture of the bacon, sweet onion and mushrooms were just heaven in my mouth. Seriously, the best I've had. [$10-11] . . I ordered the "Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries" thinking that it would be enough for one person. I was so very wrong. It took 3 of us to take it down (still had left overs). Definitely a great combo too. It had an egg on top & the fries were crispy! Loved it as well! [$11] Service was on point & the place was very clean... Great experience here. Definitely will be back when I get back to Vegas. It's "a must have" for me now.
I have found THE hamburger place in town!! The ratings and reviews are spot on!
Heard about this all the way from Hawaii had to check it out. If you not used to the hear wait in your car, there is always 15 to 20 min wait. Got seated pretty quickly as I was greeted by all staff members! Had my favorite beer Hitachino! Almost ten dollars but worth every penny. Tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and roasted pork on bun. Fantastic. For the main course was miyagi burger and kalbi burger, on point like island flavor Alan wong's American fusion. A must try at least once in LV...
This place really is the best, I've come here twice and there's always been a line but in both cases the wait was much shorter than expected. I've never waited more than 15 minutes here even though I was given 40+ minute wait times. Service is decent, food comes out inconsistently, we noticed tables after us got served before we did, etc. The food definitely makes up for everything bad that could ever happen here. You have to get the oxtail chili cheese fries, it is sweet and savory and the fries are so good. I would definitely recommend the Ronin and Kiki burgers. I've also tried the Miyagi-san and spicy miso burger - they don't stand out as much as the Ronin does. If you're feeling adventurous, upgrade to a wagyu patty, you can taste the difference. I love the food here and I make it a must-visit spot every time I come to Vegas.
One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!. It was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.. Service was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,. The menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.. For starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!. Onion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!. Kids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!. I had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy . Not a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno.. Much better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime Vinaigrette. Basically 3 veggie burgers in one.. The breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!. There was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!. My husband had the The "Banh-Mi" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. . Portions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.. Can't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!
Saw Bachi Burger on the Food Network so I really wanted to try it and overall very satisfied!! :). . Ordered:. . Ronin Burger (Medium done): yummm, juicy and flavorful, the citrus aioli sauce made it very sweet. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: loved this!! Very flavorful and perfect amount of cheese, don't mix the whole thing though, gets soggy quick!. . Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (Medium Done): You can really taste the batter of the onion rings in this one! Flavors are a good mixture and do not overpower .. tasty!. . Service is great, but then again I went at 11AM when they just opened :P, plenty of parking available.
First off let me say that they have a remarkable parking lot, which is where we waited for about 40 mins to get seated, the anticipation I had was that of waiting for a ride at Disneyland, I was mildly disappointed. By the way it looks like a starbu&* convention in the parking lot with the fancy cars and the few overdressed people looking to flex their culinary lack of taste or perhaps they are just herd follower's I don'tknow, didn't ask either way there is a slightly pretentious feeling in the air there..   . Ok, on to the table and food, let it be known that their service is EXCELLENT!, their server's are great, even if the flamboyant gentleman did forget my saracha hot sauce lol. They were quick almost instantaneous with the pre dinner drinks, which came out almost as if they had somebody behind the corner who already knew what we wanted, appetizers took about 10 mins, and they would have been worth a 20 minute wait, all of our guests reported they loved the appetizers, in fact one said he would just forget the burger and order the chicken appies and the fries for pick-up and head home, they were that good. NO compaints there at all. * I cant express how great our waiter was, and their staff even tho he did forget my hot sauce request*  They give SUPERIOR customer service..  .   About 15 mins or so after the appies came out our main course ala burgers arrived, in all their pretentious arrogant glory lol, with their glossy buns and spike stabbed thru the middle, initially I thought "so this is what those perfectly presented and prepared commercial burgers look like in real life", they looked like Hollywood props, very shiny, looking it over I had to chuckle lol, I ordered it well and it was cooked perfectly once again, if anything they are consistent here, the burger was too sweet for my tastes, it didn't deliver the punch to the palate that I was expecting but it was very OK, nothing stood out at me or there was nothing singular ingredient wise I could say I liked about this particular burger, you know eh, it was ok, it looks way better than it tastes. I cant honestly give a superb recommendation for this place because it just wasn't worth the price, its a 6 dollar burger at best with a 15 dollar presentation. Yes it does look great, but for all that flash it needs more bite. I've had better at local pubs for way less. The truffle fries were on a 1-10 scale a solid 8, very tasty as was their chili fries. .    . Maybe its the hipster crowd herd following thing that makes this place appear better than it really is, or I guess people just have mediocre taste buds but Bachi burger didn't do it for me, cant say that I will return unless its for appetizers to go.....  Get out there and eat Vegas , explore and report =) be well.
This place is always packed, we came in and asked for a table for 4.  We were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  When the time was up, they called our name and sine the other 2  people in our party were not present, we were told we could not be seated...I asked why stating we were going to order drinks and appetizers until they arrive.  We were told no, because in case the other 2 did not show up, they did not want to waste a 4 top for only 2 people, REALLY?. . So we had to wait another 15 minutes which I was not happy about but the wife was.  My money spends just like everyone else and to refuse me a table after waiting almost 45 minutes will definitely make me think twice before I take my money back to this place.  . . I know they won't care as they are busy and get the business anyway, so loosing a few customers probably is not important to them, the treatment I received as a customer though is important to me.. . The food here is good and it is sad they treat people the way they do, but I guess when you have good food and a consistent crowd, you forget that without customers, your business is nothing.
Went here last week. This place has been on our food bucket list for a while now. We had the oxtail fries, miso burger and the pork bun appetizers. . I was disappointed in the fries. The sauce had a weird sweet taste. It would have been good had they omitted whatever they put to make it sweet. I split the burger with the hubby, and while it was good it wasn't anything special. . The pork buns were yummy, but this seems like one of those "trend" foods that everyone is trying to do. You really can't go wrong with these and they were good. . Service was good, I would probably go back and order other things to try.
Service is poor. Twice here. Called and left take out order and hour later still waiting? $42 for 2 burgers and 1 fries. Think I'll pass next time. Better burgers with better service out there
Went here for my birthday for my first time. Sooo good! Friendly service. Delicious, quality burgers. Nothing like it. The place is a little small and pricey, but it's okay. Their fries and pineapple ketchup is super yum!
Great food. Absolutely shit service. If you come in and order a To-Go about 8 people walk by and look at you like you're and inconvenience. The food is the only aspect of Bachi and Shoyu Ramen keeping it afloat. Only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the guy who finally helped was awesome and made up for it...
Kalbi burger was bangin..... . Anna the waitress....cool as the other side of the pillow..... . Check...a little high for what you get but whatever. . Peanut Butter/Choc shake....i dont know if its worth $6 bucks but its a damn good milkshake
I was in Vegas for work and picking up my boss at the airport so was looking for a good lunch spot off of the strip.  I read some great reviews of Bachi Burger on Yelp so was excited to try it out.  I sat at the bar and it was easy because the wait for a table was a little bit.  My waiter was really friendly and gave a full explanation of the menu and his recommendations.  I ended up going with his favorite which was the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and the fries.  I loved the pineapple ketchup for the fries as I had never had that before.  The burger was delicious too.  It was massive and I didn't think I was going to finish it but I devoured it.. . Unassuming spot in a strip mall but great burgers!
In all honesty, I was not expecting to love this place so much. I love burgers, but had not heard much before trying the restaurant. On the same trip to Las Vegas, of course this was another one on the list for me to try. And I am so happy I did! I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :). . The three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.. . The first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!. . Kiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.. . Would highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well. Want to go again soon!
