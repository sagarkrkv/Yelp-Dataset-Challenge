Delicious breakfast. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Eggs fresh and their sourdough is crazy good. My only little criticism is the breading on my steak was a little oily (I get my gravy on the side ... yes, I'm one of those). Hubby had the grilled cheese with bacon ...to die for! Next time I'm trying the shrimp and grits.
If you blink you will miss it. So in that essence it fits the "hole in the wall" category. The parking however doesn't seem to be a problem since there is a lot if street parking all around the empty neighborhood. Inside the restaurant is a whole different story... It is alive with all the sounds of hustle and bustle coming from the open kitchen area and the echoing sounds of the warehouse style seating area coming from all the seated patrons. In short it's loud in here, definitely lively but wouldn't suggest this place if you are planning on having a conversation. The service is amazing so much so I thought at one point I had three servers since more than one person came to check on us. Now to the food. I ordered the downtown egg Benedict and there famous pancake and my husband had the two egg special. The plating of both were beautiful and the portions were generous but the flavors were not very memorable. Overall from a score of 1-10 I give  this place a 5
After seeing Anthony Bourdain dine here I drove directly to Eat after landing from So Cal. It was during a workday and found metered parking for a hour/$1.00.. . I was solo and sat at the counter which gave me a view of the chefs in action. Started off with a tasty satisfying cup of Joe. For my main entry, I had the pancakes, chicken sausage and added two poached eggs. The pancakes were some of the yummiest I've ever had. The chicken sausage went nicely with my medium poached eggs and the service from my waiter was friendly and spot on. Overall satisfied!. . The menu is southern influenced so I'm looking forward to returning and trying the  shrimp & grits or beignets.
The lovely chef was sitting outside as we walked up... Service, ambiance, everything was WONDERFUL. The pancakes are beyond words, and I'm a waffle girl. Simply the best I've ever eaten anywhere. Bar none the best brunch in town.
Wow I would highly recommend this place.  My friends and I started with the cinnamon strawberry biscuits and I never would've thought cinnamon and strawberry went together but they were amazing.  I then moved on to the pancakes. I can't tell you how amazing these pancakes are. They were so thick yet fluffy and they had a crunchy outside just like at home, amazing.  My friend has a BLT and it was fantastic it had avocado and the bread was thick and delicious.  It's a wait but it's worth the wait.
Back again last week Nd Happy to report they still rate 5 stars! I had the special of Prime Rib Hash.  Watch out the Regular Stack of Pancakes would have fed my wife twice! Nice location a short walk from all the glitz of Fremont Street Experience.
Great food. I absolutely love this place. Had the shrimp n grits and will be back again. Quick prompt and attentive service.
Excellent place off the strip. Good for couples, families, friends--especially people out of town looking for something without a slot machine in it, and yet, with delicious, local food.
My wife and I had a great experience here.  We enjoyed the ambience, food and the service.
I was excited to eat here because of all the Yelp raves about it. It's about 10 minutes from the strip and parking was easy (meter parking). Also the name of the restaurant is in a cool stylized font with the whole period thing at the end of the word eat--just makes you want to eat, right?. . I went with the Huevos Motulenos which I honestly didn't like--I'm not sure why so many people are nuts over this dish. I feel like the salsa just doesn't go well in a main course. It was an interesting concoction of food items I've never really had together but I wish I had gotten something else. I wanted to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich but they only serve it Monday through Friday. Their pancakes are huge.. . I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't because were somewhat duped into buying an appetizer. So, you know how lots of restaurants give you free bread before your meal? Our waitress asked us, after serving us water, "would you like some biscuits?" Well, to us this sounded like pre-meal free bread so we said yes. What she really meant to say is, "would you like to start with an appetizer called the 'cinnamon biscuits, warm strawberry compote'?" The money wasn't the issue, but the trickery into ordering more on the menu. She might as well have started by saying, "would you like to start with the Dom Perignon?". . The staff was very nice/efficient. I recommend checking this joint out if you want some breakfast off the strip. Is it worth taking a taxi here? No. I really only went because I had my car. Albeit, this is a decent breakfast eatery.
WOW! Just WOW! I love this place. Located next to the container park in downtown this little breakfast/brunch restaurant serves great food. The service is quick and they give very generous portions. I had the corned beef hash with two poached eggs and sourdough toast. It was great! The corned beef was tender and cooked with some potatoes and onions. It was delicious. The decor of the restaurant is very industrial but it is very cozy. Good food, good atmosphere, nuff said.
This place is a wonderful addition to downtown LV! Came here for brunch before a Saturday matinee. The atmosphere is a great blend of cozy/hole in the wall. Service was quick and the food was so flavorful! I recommend the Downtown Benedict and the chicken sausage with homemade strawberry compote.
I had bookmarked this spot because I saw some rave reviews about it a while back. Finally got around to eating here on my last trip and now I'm wondering what all the fuss was about. It's good, but nothing I had made it rise to greatness. Although, to be fair I didn't exactly order the most exciting thing on the menu. . . I got eggs. Two scrambled eggs, to be exact. And they came with smoked bacon and chive potatoes and toast, which was of the rye variety. All of the above was sufficiently cooked and tasty. None of it was particularly noteworthy, though I will point out that I give props to any place serving rye bread. If they really wanted to get on my good side, they'd serve pumpernickel or squaw. . . My gf ordered something called a "skinny jenny" which was pretty damn good. I don't know why they give it a girly, low-cal name that makes it sound like a dish catering to women. I would have ordered one, too, if it had a moniker that sounded more unisex. My eyes wandered right over it because it sounded like some health food thing tailored for girls trying to keep off the pounds.
We were looking for a good breakfast joint near downtown vegas and pulled this up on yelp. Decided to try it based on reviews and we were not disappointed! I ordered corned beef hash which was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. It came with 4 slices of amazing sourdough toast. My husband ordered the eggs benedict. The potatoes were ok (they needed a little salt), but we both loved the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was light and delicious! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the limited menu choices.
I live in the NW part of Vegas, and it's not too often I'm downtown early enough to catch some of this awesome food I've been hearing about from this hip, cool place called (eat.).  Since today was one of those rare days, I stopped in! . . Overall, great place! Not sure I'd go out of my way too often to dine here, but I will definitely be back. . . I had the breakfast sandwich (oops, I forgot the name, but the menu is simple).  It was a ciabatta bun, egg, applewood bacon, feta, and truffle oil sauteed mushrooms.  Served with a side of fresh cooked potatoes. The flavors were awesome, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients....and some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever tasted (usually I won't eat them)!. . The service was great, and the staff is friendly. Every server said hello to me or checked my drink refills at least once while I ate. Not everyone likes that constant attention while eating, but I loved it. It was my first time there, but I felt like I was a neighborhood regular! WOW! What an impression...kudos to the staff!. . Parking in the area is kind of a hassle and you will usually have to pay, but it's not too much of a big deal.  I also might like to see more variety in the menu options, but I'll have to see if the menu changes on my next visit to (eat.).
Fun place to go and the food is average, but there are lots of choices.  Went back once, but will probably wait for a while before I go back.  Omlette House is still the best!
The best breakfast place in town!!!! Good food, good vibe, and amazing atmosphere! Downtown is the place to be for breakfast!
Yay! I was so happy to finally get to try this place! I'm so happy to see it doing well! The place was busy last Monday during lunch, full with very little wait. It is a casual breakfast/lunch joint. Breakfast ending at 11am. :( The BF was sad about that, he wanted to try the Chilaquiles. Which I think did say on the printed menu at the restuarant but that's not what we were worrying about at that time...it was what are we going to choose!! . . I had the free range chicken sandwich with fresh mozz, tomato and pesto mayo on ciabatta. So yummy!! You can get house made chips or potato salad and 'a really good pickle'. The waitress, who was nice and attentive, asked if I'd rather have the tomato salad, why of courese I want the lighter option!! The tomato salad was good! Cherry tomatoes with fresh sliced garlic, balsamlic dressing, basil...simple and yum! However, I wish it was not served in such a big bowl because it made the portion look super tiny. . . The non adventrous food eating BF had eggs, home fries and bacon. You can't go wrong. Their home fires are big pieces where most diners are smaller and end up mushy(but still yummy) I liked the stability of these yummy nuggets! . . I also of course love that they serve coffee from my friends at Colorado River Roaster!! SO glad to see more resturants serving their delicious local roasted coffee!. . We'll be coming here more often on Lunch Date Mondays, as it is super close to the BF's work! Yay! BF approved!
Love this little restaurant !  Started with strawberry/cinnamon busquits. So yummy with compote strawberry on top.  I had amazing scrambled eggs, like what did they so to make it taste so good!  Then a pancake that was the best I ever ate.   Moist and fluffy on inside crispy on outside. . I forgot to mention the coffee is outstanding .  Service was great.  Cool local feel.  Would go back for sure.
I came to meet a fellow co-worker for a Sunday breakfast and we had heard so much about this place.. The hostesses were friendly and genuinely gracious.. The menu was fun in its wording but the descriptions of their offerings were inviting.. When we received our breakfast, the portions seemed more than adequate, when my co worker and I were done eating, we were definitely more than satisfied!. Imagine down home cooking with an upscale flair.. Even the atmosphere felt like I was amongst a large family gathering.. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone!
Went to breakfast here with a friend and really I'd love to give 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4. The service was ok although everyone seemed bugged at us asking questions like do you serve alcohol (no) do you have peanut butter (no) is there anything off the menu (no but then yes when asked about an online advertised eggs Benedict) my friend got the eggs Benedict it had spinach and applewood bacon (delish) I got the chilaquiles so good! Very clean flavor pallets and we also had a short stack to share FYI way too much food none of it was finished but all was really good! I don't live near down town so won't frequent but won't be top on my list either.
Loved the decor and the vibe. Great breakfast/brunch spot downtown. It's fantastic to have a place in Vegas that isn't a touristy breakfast spot and it made me think of breakfasting in other cities I have visited like San Diego. It's great to have a unique little culinary treat to add some culture that isn't a gut-busting breakfast buffet or a greasy spoon (nothing wrong with those if that is what you are looking for). . . The coffee was amazing. It was one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a while. I ravenously consumed the shrimp and grits and it did not disappoint. The flavor combination hit the spot.
When you're in Vegas, it's hard to stand out as a restaurant because there are just so many amazing places to eat!  The competition is so great that you really have to be something to stand up against the glorious buffets, gourmet foods, and restaurants run by world famous chefs.  Even so, eat. blew me away!  It's located very close to downtown Vegas so is perfect for those who want to avoid the crowds on the strip for a bit or those staying in downtown. Think comfort food, with a delicious twist!  A very, very delicious twist.  . . I had the Truffled Egg Sandwich which was by far, the most amazing sandwich I have ever had.  With every bite, I just wanted to melt.  I liked it so much that I didn't want the ciabatta bread to tone down any of the flavor, so I forgo the bun and ate just the inside like I would a scramble.  Then, I ate the bread separately because I realized that some of the flavor actually soaked inside!  The Corned Beef Hash and Cinnamon Biscuits with Strawberry Compote were not as wonderful as the Truffled Egg Sandwich, but still were both divine.. . I would like to add that when eating here, I was incredibly full, so I know that I wasn't enjoying my food simply because I was starving.  :P
Don't understand the high ratings. Atmosphere of the place is cool but the food is lacking. Mix flavors that should not be mixed and dishes lack the right type of flavor. I got the huevos with red and green salsas and both of the salsas themselves lacked flavor but then there were all kinds of random other things in the dish which just didn't fit. And I wouldn't be as disappointed if it was a cheap breakfast place by for the hefty price tag of this dish it is not worth what you get.
I think this may be a little local find that we stumbled upon. Staff was quick, food was excellent, menu had good choices enough for me to want to go out of my way next time I'm here and pick something else on the menu. Thanks for a good breakfast/lunch!
