Pretty much got hustled again, $83 cover charge just to be way too uncomfortable by how overpacked it is. Pretty much chest to chest everywhere you go in the club. How dare people say it is the highest rated club when you can't even move. Terrible...just terrible...
Hakkasan is actually a pretty nice club. It has 5 flights of stairs, which for heels is probably a nightmare, especially as they are black and without lighting. . The other complaint is that they wont give water, only $7 Fiji bottles. The 2 dance levels are a nice design and while its busy its not too crowded.
I'm going to have to give this place a three, and that was probably because my expectations were really high and had just gone to XS the night before. Given that this place was so hyped and expensive to build I was expecting a bigger space, or at least crowd control to prevent the shove fest on the dance floor. I was just trying to dance with my girlfriends and was pushed around the whole night. Just couldn't take it and had to leave early. Luckily we didn't have to wait in any of the lines and were taken straight to the elevator to go up.
Hakkasan is an incredible experience. The place has so much eye candy with everything that is going on around you, that it would be very difficult to not be entertained. . . we grabbed a table at the venue with bottle service and let the vibe of the environment come to us. Sure enough, within a few hours of getting to the event, we were having a blast. . . My only issue was the latency in getting us in, even with a table reservation set up. unfortunately, it still took 45 minutes. Outside of that, definitely an awesome experience!
Drinks are a bit pricey for regular drinks at $14-$20 (per), but it's Vegas sooo.. As for the club, I'd give it a B+ experience. If you want to get on the dance floor, it gets really packed once the headliner starts his/her/their set (get there early). Good looking ladies and guys are pretty chill. I do feel for those who are annoyed by the stairs because once you have a few drinks, it does become a struggle/annoyance.. . Overall, I think this place drives good business because of who has a residency there. I'll be back as long as that continues!
We came here again (against my better judgement from my last review of this place), but this time I was hoping the experience would be better getting bottle service. Alas no. We had a group of 8 ladies. The waitress looked like Kim Kardashian, beautiful. Too bad her attitude didn't match her face. She was rude to us the entire night, and I watched while she poured drinks for all the guys around and ignored us. Maybe she's the type of girl who feels more comfortable around men, maybe she didn't like the fact that we were women and thought we wouldn't tip her well, who knows. There's a mandatory 40% tip anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter whether she's nice to us. Last time I get bottle service here, what's the point? When you spends thousands of dollars, you expect a little ass kissing, not attitude. "Calm the f-- down", not exactly what I like to hear from someone paid to be nice to us.. . Let's face it, bottle service is for guys so they can hope for groups of hot exhausted women to come in, rest their feet, flirt for a drink, and maybe more. Women get bottle service so they don't have feel obligated to converse with creepy men just to sit down somewhere. We don't want men pretending to like us so they can have a place to hang out, we just want a place to call home for 3 hours, a place to dance without getting spiked in the toes, and amazing customer service.You would think that deserves some props from a woman who probably wishes she were somewhere else "if she could just save enough money..."
Went June 2013.  We were 6 guys.  After being told we needed girls (nothing new) to get in, we found 8 girls and brought them back.  Some dude in charge, I guess the manager, took them all and brought them inside.  We didn't care as long as we got inside.  We eventually did.  Big place, expensive, of course, and the main floor was EDM music.  None of us are really into that so we were pumped when one of us found out about the hip hop room.  We spent the rest of the night there.  Good times, don't remember much.  Back in Vegas this weekend and we'll be back.
As long as you get on the guest list via promoters you shouldn't have to pay the entrance fee. But it is Vegas, so be sure that there are more females than males in your group. Drinks are also expensive inside, so either pre-game or buy alcohol at on the bars inside the MGM. Don't worry that line to move inside goes fast, just be patient. . . But those stairs! Oh my goodness, they are killer!
Went to Hakkasan for Calvin Harris! Was originally on the guest list but we had a whole situation about that. We originally thought that our cover fee was waived but when we got to the cashier, she told us that it was ~$30? per person. Then we had a whole dilemma with the bouncers and in the end, he allowed 4 of us to have free entry. So in the end, we each paid around $17. It was pretty worth it because seeing Calvin Harris at a show is already around $50? . . The club itself is really nice and I absolutely love the interior design. It's definitely one of those higher end kind of clubs so drinks were really expensive. The workers are amazingly nice and it was just a great experience overall. We got right in front of the DJ booth and that night, we all decided to wear red and coincidentally Calvin Harris played "Summertime Sadness." Our friends also became friends with the security that was in front of us and allowed us to put our shoes right under the DJ booth. He was really nice and overall, just a great night.
This was actually my first time at Hakkasan and from my first experience, it was okay. Because there are two dance floors it made it comfortable for people to listen to whatever kind of music they want to listen to because there was a hip hop dance floor on the bottom floor and the main dj on the top. I spent most of my time at the bottom dance floor because the music was soooo loud on the top floor. Both of the dance floors are pretty small too. I feel that the space is mainly catered to the people who get bottle service, which is not many because if you get bottle service downstairs you would have to stay there. They also do not give you glow sticks that usual night clubs do in Vegas. . I guess I can't complain because I got in for free because I was with a bunch of girls and we had a promoter. But one thing about that was we had to wait in line for a hour just to get in, because they said we had to be there by a certain time, but they just made us wait. . . One thing that annoyed me was that there was NOOOOOOO place to sit, unless you got bottle service. Which was ridiculous because not everybody gets bottle service when you go clubbing and for you to not let customers sit down because they didn't have bottle service is annoying and it really did not make me want to go there again. Every time someone was sitting on a ledge of something, security would come over and tell the person to get down. Even in the lounge area there were no seats. There were just tables where you would stand with your drinks. . . There is also no water fountain where you can get free water. You have to buy small SMALLLLL Fiji water bottles for $9 and hope that will last you the whole night.. . A lot of my friends have hyped up this place up for me but currently this place has only disappointed me.
I came down to Vegas for a Bachelorette weekend. One of the places I wanted to take the Bride to Be was Hakkasan. She has never been there before and Above and Beyond was playing and We were super excited to go see them. We got in contact w/a promoter who said he'll take care of everything including a comp table. We arrived there, got in and was placed pretty much on the back wall all the way to the right table behind the dj. It was amazing! He said he was getting us 2 bottles for free, we were ecstatic! There was another group table next to us with a bachelorette party as well :). . The place was great, love the light shows, overly crowded esp dance floor. . . So the reason for the 1 star. The promoter told me we are seated in a prime spot and he asked for gratuity. I was thinking sure, our cover entry fee was waived and we didn't mind paying gratuity for the bottle service girls and we were getting 2 bottles. The first bottle came out, we were dancing and having fun, and the promoter KURT BENZ came up to me again for gratuity. So the girls and I gave more than $200 and I said "Gratuity for the girls" and he replied by saying "No, it's for me" and he pocketed the money. My first thought was "How odd" I thought it would be for the bottle girls. So within 20mins we prob finished more than half of our first bottle and then was told someone bought the table so they scooted us out. I get it, no prob. He told me he would find my girls a new table, and to text him in a bit. We did and i text him back, he simply replied by saying no tables now, give me a sec and he would postpone the time to text him. Mind you, We don't mind mingling w/other ppl at tables or partying next to guy/girls, sharing is caring :). Looking around I noticed there were tables in the back not being occupied and would've been fine if it was not around the dance floor as long as We got to see Above and Beyond.. An hour later looked back at the table we were at and saw No one occupying that section. So i text back KURT asking luck on tables? He NEVER replied back that night.. . We ended up going to Light which was way more fun. The promoters at Light takes care of you regardless if you have a table or not.. They want repeated customers. . . So next day, saw another Hakkasan promoter and he said he'll give me a comp table for my group, I told him what happened the night before with Hakkasan promoter KURT BENZ and he apologized on Hakkasans behalf... Within 3-4 hours I got a text from KURT saying he has a comp table for me . Ummm No thank you. He left a nasty taste of Hakkasan in our mouths.  . . Hope things like this doesn't happen for other party goers of Hakkasan... . Thanks and Good vibes!
We booked a table on the main floor and after our dinner we were escorted to the elevator and taken to our table. Our floor was just EDM so I went to the hip hop floor which had some throwbacks and some current. The crowd is really diverse and I'm glad we got a table. Our waitress stayed with us most of the time and they made to continue to replenish what was out.
My girls and I were headed down the Strip on our way to get some good ol' Earl of Sandwich when we were flagged down by a Hakkasan promoter. He did his usual opening bit, asking what we had planned for the evening, and we answered honestly that we had been offered free drinks/entry at Tao, XS, etc. and were planning on stopping by as many as we could manage in six-inch heels.  . . "Don't bother!" He cried. "Let me tell you how this works." He then proceeded to give us a twenty-minute rundown of how he used to work as a promoter at TAO, how much TAO sucked and how much better Hakkasan was. He also said that he could put us on the "VIP Guest List" if we were there by 11, but couldn't promise free drinks because the club was popular enough as it was. Fair enough. . . So we ended up ditching Tao (the free drinks, and our free table) twenty minutes into the night to head to Hakkasan. We got there at 11 pm sharp and saw a line wrapping around the building and going out the back door. "Good thing we're on the VIP list!" we said. Funny story - so was everyone else in line. We texted our promoter, and he wasn't even there! He was at XS and he told us to just get in line. . . It took us about an hour to get into the club, and it was so packed that there was no room on the dance floor to do anything but shuffle around. We ended up leaving after half an hour because we were so underwhelmed. The funny thing is that if the promoter we met hadn't boosted our expectations so high with his lies, we might have actually had a decent night there. By then it was too late to get entry into any other club, so we ended up going to Tao and having a great time. . . Not crossing this place off my list completely yet, but doesn't bode well that literally the high point of my experience at Hakkasan was when my friends and I ran to get mozzarella sticks at the Rainforest Cafe to eat while waiting in line. . . Rainforest Cafe: 1, Hakkasan: 0
I've gone to dance festivals/gigs all over the world so I know what I'm talking about - this is the worst place for dance music in the world. Overrated djs spinning shit music (Hardwell simply is nowhere near the best DJ in the world; Tiesto isn't in the top 50; Steve Aoki sprays people with champagne); 1000 dollars for a 500 dollar table; paying 1000 dollars and not even getting a table in the Dance Floor area - no that costs 4000; tiny dance floor that you can't move in; dickhead bouncers; pretentious idiots wearing suits - sorry lads, you're supposed to be topless with glow sticks and whistles, dance music is about raving, so full of drugs you don't know where you are, not trying to look like you're applying for a job.. . Maybe people from the US won't understand, but if you're Europe, and grew up on this genre, stay away, this is the worst arena I have ever, and will ever be to.
Over crowded, it had two levels, hip hop and edm type music. Both floors were crowded and the elevators to go down do not work unless you ask security so we stood there for a good 5+ minutes until security apologized.  Overall, it might be a club you could visit during the week but weekend is too crowded and it has too many obnoxious people. . . If you get free entrance- be aware the drinks are super expensive. . Midori sour-16$ each. Vodka and red bull- 20$ (kettle one vodka) each. Adios- 18$ each. . You maybe free, but the drinks are crazy expensive
Went to Hakkasan's on Sunday night, it was packed! After going to a lame party at the Venetian, then a lame party at Treasure Island, my friends and I decided to take a cab to MGM at midnight and go to Hakkasans for better luck. We had met a promoter named Drew on the strip earlier that day and he was great! Glad we took his advice and got put on the list because it TOTALLY saved the night! . .  When we got there there, there were so many long lines, which we took a relief (it must be a good party, if there so many people trying to get in). We were VIP so the line we had to wait in wasn't that bad. We waited in line for a little but the line moved rather quickly and we ended up getting bumped to the front line thanks to Drew and got in free. It's huge but I like that it has different levels and different rooms. The dance floor was crowded but when the party is good, that's to be expected. Didn't have to wait long at the bar for drinks- they were expensive but I wasn't the one paying ;) Also, it's Vegas- drinks are pricey everywhere! It was a good time! Good DJ, good drinks and I like the area where they have the high tables set up and the music isn't AS loud because you can chill out and have a conversation and re charge. Nice place, will def go back!
This is one of the best nightclubs in Vegas.  We went on a Friday night and it was packed.  I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance online to avoid the long line.. . Pros: They have two different floors, lower floor is a little more chill and not as crowded.. . Cons:  definitely very pricey, especially for guys, upper level was insanely crowded.
The club is very nice. We went last Saturday in a big group of about 20 for a bachelor party. We had reservations and bottle service. I really think it was overhyped. None of us went down to the main dance floor but that's ok because looking down, it looked like A LOT of dudes and not many girls. The music is loud and mostly techno/EDM stuff, which is very popular these days in Vegas. . . I thought that people were gonna be dressed much better, but lots of untucked, wrinkled shirts. The girls looked great though.. . It was nice that we were escorted to our table. But 5,000 dollar bottles of Grey goose for a relatively empty club? Not that great. I was expecting tons of gorgeous ladies, but it was mostly dudes and lots of non-American girls.
Sorry but this club is amazing. We didn't wait in those several miles-long lines. Just paid the reasonable entrance fee up front with our group and had an amazing time. Saw Calvin Harris spinning on the main floor, but what I enjoyed and LOVED the most was the hip hop floor. That mist steam machine is amazing, whoever the DJ was for Friday June 6 really knew how to rock the dance floor. He played all the right songs, my husband and I had the best time at this place and have considered this place as our favorite night club. . . Hakkasan, we will be back for you. . . Btw the drinks here suck. You will get diabetes from the amount of sugar and syrup they put in there.
Watched above and beyond here. Their music was amazing but the club was not. I had such high expectations based on their publicity.. . It's like Sutra in Orange County x 10 in douchiness.. . CONS: There's no space to dance on the bottom floor. Everywhere is occupied by booths. You cant dance in front of booths (too crowded and bouncers keep pushing). You cant really dance behind the booth bc theres all these ppl dancing on top of the areas behind the booths. Theres no view of the DJs ANYWHERE unless youre right in front. I hung out with some people in a private booth upstairs. What was sad is that these kids paid close to $3000 but they were stuck in the cornermost space. So while they had awesome privacy and no one crashing into them, from their booth I couldn't even see the DJs or see the cool visual displays. How lame! Oh yea, the opening DJ Fergie also played the same generic crap over and over until 1am. Yawn.. . PROS: bought tix in advance and barely waited 5 mins in line. . . Conclusion: I will never come back here.
Did he just call me ma'am?. . What is this thump thump thud fist pump I hear overhead?. . Who is this guy with an angelic halo?  And why are people so in awe of him?. . What?  $19 for each well Vodka Red Bull?  I'll take a water on the rocks please.. . Let's start from the beginning.  I was able to get on the guest list, not because I'm cool (I actually really am though), but because it was a Thursday and there were heaps of promoters spinkled up and down the strip.  I felt quite special walking into the club and bypassing the regular folks.. . For all the hype, this place was a lot smaller than what I imagined.  It appeared to me that there was one main dance floor, one off to the side, and an upstairs area suitable for some restricted dancing but mostly standing. . . This is a cool place if you're into EDM music,  enjoy being stripped of your personal bubble, and like rubbing elbows and eardrums with the young and beautiful. . . IDK, would I go back?  I think I'm past my prime and my bedtime.
Hakkasan in the English language actually translates to, "Billion-Mile-Walk-Through-Casino" or something along the lines of that. Now I don't have a problem walking to where I need to get to when I'm in Vegas, mainly because you can have a drink in your hand the whole time. But if you've got women in your group with you, those heels begin to betray their owners after a quarter mile because let's be honest, looking sexy comes with a price with those heels.. . The nightclub itself is a very, very nice venue. The interior is sweet, the lights and lasers that have made non-EDM acts at Coachella look like crap are all there as well complete with massive confetti and cold air blasts. My only gripe with Vegas is the lack of dance floor at the several nightclubs this city has to offer. When I go to a nightclub, I want to boogie, not blow thousands of dollars to have people stare at me while I get presented bottles (I would recommend bottle service to those who haven't tried it, it's just something you've got to experience at least once. There's nothing wrong with stroking your ego once in a while to make you feel awesome, justbe polite about it). . . Now because this place is the new, hot venue in Vegas with the exception of Drai's reopening, everybody and their mommas and her church friends want to go to Hakkasan. They spend millions of dollars on a massive marketing campaign to display their roster to the public, and their talent is pretty top notch with some heavy hitters (Calvin Harris, A&B, Hardwell, Tiesto). With this, also comes about a 25-33 percent increase in prices all-around from drinks to entry. If you're going to complain about Vegas having 20 dollar drinks, than you probably should've never gone in the first place honestly. This place isn't cheap, they expect you to drop hundreds if you don't have a booth, and you might even have to fork over a couple hundred just to get in if you didn't get a pre-sale ticket or arrive with a small army of girls.. . The reason they got 2 stars is because this nightclub has a miniscule-sized dance floor, booths that dominate the views of the DJ booth, and beyond that, you're just kind of shafted because you've spent a couple hundred to get in and have a drink in your hand. You have no views of the DJ you came to see, even worse, the view is just of people celebrating at their tables. IF you're getting table service, this venue is awesome. IF you're just visiting, make plans for another place because it fails hard. Nobody enjoys leaving Vegas with a bad taste in your mouth. Get your mind out the gutter folks.
Huge line even though we were on the guest list, not worth the wait. Once we got inside it was so packed (well the first floor) we couldn't even get to the dance floor with how full it was. Upstairs was ok but just edm  music gets boring. Doubt I'll be going back to this club again.
Never have been so disappointed in a bar/club/venue in my life. I spoke with a member of the Hakkasan staff, named Josh Karate, Friday afternoon, to ask about how to purchase pre-sale tickets for Steve Aoki the next night. After talking for a few minutes, he added my friend and I to the staff guest list and we were told to come around 10:15 and we'd get right in, free admission for me, and reduced for my friend. WRONG. We got there at 10, spoke with a security guard who said, "Sorry, staff guest list is the same as promoters. One line.Get to the back" which was well over 1,000 people long, out the door to the casino and around the building. The "guest list" line was longer than general admission! . The problem is that they hire promoters to stand on the street and put everyone and their mom on the guest list. We waited for two hours only to move a few feet and eventually leave. After planning my trip to Vegas around seeing Steve Aoki, I could not have been more disappointed to not even see the club. Hakkasan should teach their employees not to lie to customers simply so they look to be the most popular club in Vegas. I wouldn't recommend ANYONE spend a DIME here.
I wrote a bad review in the past for Hakkasan but recently went back and witnessed a huge improvement! I now love and support this nightclub. Very fun environment, they do not let too many people in to the point where you cannot walk like XS does. Bartenders are very friendly and totally love their job, respectable hard working people run this club. Highly recommend! On a side note, be aware that this club has different levels and many stair cases.
I can sum it up in 1 word-Horrible. First floor is tiny! Drinks are crazy expensive and not very good. The guest list is a joke! They made us wait an hour outside for no reason. Music was decent and the atmosphere was borderline douch-y but ok if mind your own. . . There are too many good places on the strip to go back to this place...
Been to nightclubs and festivals all over the world, including Ibiza. This place has the tiniest dance floor ever and is nearly impossible to maneuver through. The only thing that was a saving grace one time was that my girlfriends promoter set us up at a table by Tiesto and no douche bags were allowed. . . Great line up of djs, and the bottle service girls are very friendly. Just wish it would accommodate more people.  XS and marquee win.
Hakkasan is located inside the MGM grand. I was on the GL so we went to the GL line and it was free before 1am, so we had to hurry our asses there! We made it & it was free, thank god! Anywayyys, bouncers were nice and they made our transition inside the club pretty smoothly. Once we got in, I immediately noticed how SMALL it was. The dancefloor was sooooo tiny! :( When I finally made my way over, I could barely move/dance. It was literally body to body ... and this was on a day where there's NO ONE famous dj-ing! So imagine how bad the crowd would get if Tiesto or Hardwell was up there .... I wouldn't wanna be there! . . But that's all I can really say because I got super messed up and I can't remember anything else. Only that I couldn't dance at all because there was no room and the parts where it's kinda open, the security made you move :(
They pack this club way too tight to make it possible to have fun. Couldn't move once I got in. Far to packed to have any fun near the DJ. Too small of a dance floor for the amount of people they allow in. Cool to see a first time, but would never return. Unless you are buying a table for thousands of dollars, I don't see how you could enjoy this.
Hakkasan, your DJs and your venue is what makes this club. Otherwise, I prefer everywhere else other than here.. . The venue is beautiful. Although it is troublesome (all those damn stairs), that dome like roofish top with all those lights make the venue pretty awesome to check out. . . There is a hip hop lounge called the ling ling room if EDM isn't your thing. There's also occasionally the hip hop lounge open which is a bit more chill if you wanna be away from the craziness. FYI drinks costs an arm and a leg. I think it costs more than Light and XS!. . But my main hate for this club isn't any of those things. As I do like the venue and I do like the DJ. I'm even very fond of my host.... . It really just takes ONE guy. And that one guy is the same guy me and my friends always deal with. Its the guy that works the table line and checks you in for your tables. YES, THAT GUY. He has no order, he just lets his friends in and then makes everyone else wait HOURS. I get it, if i'm late an hour or 30 mins to claim my table, sure i'll wait an hour, my fault. But are you freaking kidding me!? When we're there 30 mins early... and you still make us wait an hour!?!? There's plenty more stories I can put up, but then you'll see 5 more paragraphs of my angry rantings.
Best sound and scene in Vegas right now. Crowd control needs to be better and let in better "talent".
The worse nightclub I've ever been to that I had to write a review for. Unless you buy bottle service or on the cramped dance floor, you will not have a view of the DJ anywhere you are. I understand they're running a business, but charging $9 for water is ridiculous. You aren't even allowed tap water. I'd recommend not coming here unless you buy bottle service because this nightclub is inferior compared to many of the other options on the strip.
This is what I emailed to the management of Hakkasan. No response....... . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. . Subject: Hakkasan: Pursuit of Hapiness. . Dear gatekeeper to my happiness, . . I was visiting Las Vegas for the Labor Day weekend, and came to your club Hakkasan on Saturday night to see one of my favorite DJ's, Calvin Harris. . . My excitement was soon tarnished by the misfortune of being targeted in what appeared to be a series of professional iPhone thefts (don't worry I followed Fergie's wisdom, "Big Girls Don't Cry"). Around 12:30am, I realized the zippers on my purse had all been masterfully unzipped without my noticing. I have luckily managed to travel through some of most dangerous pick pocket areas in the world (looking at you, Barcelona) without ever having a theft before, so I know that I was not simply being careless. This craft was so ingeniously perfected that I wouldn't doubt the theft ring includes Calvin, with the thieves planning to target people when Calvin says to the audience, "Put your hands up!". (Just kidding Calvin, let's be friends). . . Luckily, I'm a very "what goes around, comes around" type of person and was able to enjoy the rest of the night to the best of my abilities (minus the creep that decided face-touching was appropriate stranger behavior). After all, this situation was not life or death, and the kind thief managed to leave my ID so I could still get into clubs the next days. I thought that was very thoughtful of him/her! I also am not one of the many people trashing your club on Yelp for this disaster. Everyone deserves a fair chance to make recompense, right? That's me putting good Karma vibes your way. . . Everyone I spoke with (Las Vegas Police and your nice bouncer staff) on the way out of the club informed me of your contact details so that I could share my story, and hope that your desire for good Karma would be enough to help compensate me for the situation. . . My contact details are below and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon, friend. . . Kind regards,. . P.S. Buying a phone out out of contract is a buzz kill, right?
I had the worst experience here ever. Prior to attending we spoke with Rob Chu originally from New York and he invited us to be on our way. Wegot there and spoke to Rob on the phone and he instructed us where to go in line. We waited in line and spoke to a bald African American man and he said he called Rob, we then waited for 3 hours and Rob comes out then tells us we can't get in because they won't let anyone in after 12 am. DO NOT GO TO THIS CLUB AFTER 12AM on Sundays BECAUSE ROB CHU informed us that they don't let anyone in after 12AM
Be prepared to take 3 ID's and a credit card with you because apparently these guys don't know how to identify their customers. We waited for almost an hour because 4 bouncers kept on insisting that my friends ID wasn't hers even after she answered their questions and showed them her credit card which by the way had another picture of her.. . So after that whole unnecessary ordeal (the guy was just being a douche) we went to another club and guess what, we got in. Been to the majority of the clubs here in Vegas and never has this happened. All I can say is the staff here better get their heads out of their a** and realize people aren't going to look exactly the same on their license, especially after it was taken 4 years ago.
The bouncer with the Mohawk cornered me and harassed me last night. I was sober, he wouldn't let me walk by... He let tons of guys and other people walk by and he held me there for over 10 minutes. Everytime I tried to move he would grab me and tell me not to struggle. I had to run to get away from him and he chased after me until I found another bouncer who helped me and got him away from me. I was in tears, it was a horrible experience. I have never been treated this way. I am filing a report right now. Beware..
Lol lots of hate at this club in the reviews. To be honest, if you embrace how Vegas works, there's nothing too out of the ordinary about Hakkasan. It's not your usual city club. I've had more trouble trying to get into a club in Houston than in Vegas. Play by the rules and you'll be FINE. Gentlemen: wear leather shows, slacks, or nice jeans (darker the better), and something with a collar whether its a shirt or a blazer. You have to look the part and you won't get denied. Remember they're trying to promote "upscale, trendy, nightlife" not "#brolife" Ladies, you have so much freedom with what you can wear so I don't think I need to comment on it. . . As for drinks, hell yeah they're going to be expensive! It's VEGAS. A red bull costs 6 bucks from my hotel and a mini bottle of goose (50mL) costs $12. So it's gonna be pretty bad when you're trying to buy drinks at a club. We were pleasantly surprised with a round was only $72 (3 Long Islands and a Patron shot).. . Now on to playing the game, the dance floor is reserved for VIPs, people picked by promoters, or people who have money for the bouncers. If you are none of these three then you can't get to the dance floor. Bam, hang out on the decks. Lol it's actually nicer there I think. We were on the main dance floor and it got pretty balmy pretty quickly. I was praying for the CO2 jets which weren't coming soon enough.. . Anyway, embrace Vegas. This is how it is at every club (unless you go to the smaller ones that aren't packed to the brim) so don't think Hakkasan is completely evil. . . I had a blast and would definitely come back.
We arrived early expecting a long guest list line and we were right.  The line was long but it moved unlike some other clubs.  Half of my party had to drop out of the line due to too much sun at the MGM pool.  We arrived in the club about midnight and it was already packed.  It was kind of hard to move around and the bars were about 2-3 people deep.   Beers are ten dollars each, holly cow, but thats about he price at most of the mega clubs.  . . So why the 4 stars?  Once your in,  if you want to be in the crowd you can easily be there.  If you want to stand out of the way a bit, there are places for you, just explore the club a bit.  The dance floor, VIP areas and DJ booth are all controlled pretty well by the staff.  The best part of the club though is the energy and the music.  If you like EDM and high energy dance music this is the place.  If you keep up on the latest mixed and beats you are sure to hear lots of it here.  . . My only recommendations would be to make the club larger and or have it open more nights of the week.  Although I was ok with the crowded club I am sure there were lots of people who waited in line much longer than me to get in.  An hour or two in a vegas line is a lot of time when most people are only there a couple of nights.
I wish I could rate this place with 0 stars. . . Came here to see Hardwell and W&W for EDC week. My host put me under a guestlist and said to come by 10 because we had a group of guys. The rate they told us was $75 for males and 0 cover charge for the ladies. We got there before 10, and asked the guys with the suits with the mini ipads about the rates and they had said the same. fast foward 2 hours and we finally reach the front of the line to only be told  guys were $170 and ladies were $66. . . ....are you serious? We could've just bought tickets, but the host personally said that he would put us on guest list and we would be able to get in with no problem. . . Anyways, we were trying to make a decision to pay the fee or not, another guy in a suit with the ipad in his hand shoved us out of the line yelling, "step off the line if you're not paying". Uh, hello. You clearly see us discussing if we want to pay or not. Not even a half second later, the same guy grabbed me and threw me off the line telling us off. Where is the professionalism? TRAIN YOUR STAFF PLEASE.. . After what I went through with the staff,  I don't think I will ever come here again.
There is a reason this venue has only 3 stars.  The door guy, Brad Stiles, made it apparent to my girlfriend in table reservations that he was going to ignore her.  We had a reservation under his name from another host that is very prominent in Las Vegas.  He left us out for 2 hrs, then said sorry for giving away our table and to blame our host. Then he said he will give us free drink tickets... Uh no thank you. You gave away our table on purpose!!! We waited patiently and he blatantly ignored us.  He was a D*ck.
Not going to lie, this club pretty much exceeded my expectations on clubbing for the first time in Vegas. We showed up a bit late but didn't have to wait in line for very long. Before we could even pitch about knowing so and so to get on the guestlist, the manager handed us the slip to get in. Which makes me lol of how shallow these Vegas clubs are but I'm not complaining. Nervo was playing & they were awesome! It was too jammed packed so we had to go downstairs where they were playing hip hop to find a bar. The cost of alcohol is ridiculous!! $35 for two shots of vodka?! But I guess that's Vegas for ya! The music at both levels were pretty good, the atmosphere, everyone was having a blast! Two thumbs up from me for this club
This club is the worst club we have ever been to. My sister got her phone stolen and the security and bouncers here seriously have no idea what is going on. Nobody knows where security is, nobody knows where lost and found is. This was one of the most frustrating experiences ever. I heard many people have lost or have had their phones stolen here before and now my sister has experienced this herself. Do not go here unless you want your stuff stolen.
Went to this club on a Thursday night because my cousin got us om the guestlist.. . We got there at 945 but we didnt go in till 1040, which I notice the guestlist line is also combine with general.admission, so dont expect to go in right away.. Went in yo the first dance floor which they play house music, the dance floor wasnt big at all for a well known club.. The second dance floor wasnt even a dance floor, it was mostly lounges for ppl that are getting bottleservice. Ur pretty much dancing in a small aisle with ppl consistently pushing u trying to get thru.. . Both DJs were horrible, I had high expectation for this club.... . I had check out Drais (Cromwell hotel) the Saturday before, no long lines, big dance floor outside patio with awesome view. Go to drais!!. . I will definitely not recommend hakkasan to anyone.
Came to Hakkasan and see NERVO the other night and had a blast! Unfortunately these bouncers think they're better than everyone and play Mr. Macho; hope karma bites them in the ass. Thankfully there was this one bouncer, Sean Maguire (aka the tall guy with the mohawk)  who was seriously one of the coolest most down to earth bouncers I've ever met. I greatly appreciated his kindness when I wanted to go to the front of the DJ booth to take a couple pictures. People should learn from him.
Last night my friend and I went to Hakkasan at yhe MGM where we were also staying as guests.  We definitely were not treated as guests by any means at Hakkasan.  We paid one if the employees $2500 cash at front of line to get a table.  After being seated at table,  we were approached by a waitress who asked us why we were at the table we were escorted to. Then security came up and said we were at the wrong table and no other tales were available.  They basically kicked us out of seating area.  Then security said the most we can do is get you some comped drinks while we figure this out. They said "wait right here" and then NEVER came back. We tried finding this security guy the entire second half of night and couldnt it was so crowded. We lost $2500!!! and were shunned aside like garbage. Nice..... completely ruined our nite and rest of weekend.
Visited hakkasan recently to see dj tiesto.  I have been to lots of Vegas night clubs and was initially very excited about this place.  Then a couple of things happened.  I won't focus on the standard super long lines or the $17 well rum and cokes I bought.  Or the fact that like many others here my friends cell phone was stolen.. I'm more interested in the things at this club that can cause danger to life and limb.. . 1.  They would not serve tap water at the bars.  We were told we would need to buy $9 bottled water.  I told them my friend was ill and they still would not serve it.  So we left the club (knowing we would not get back in - no re-entry).  I was able to get a glass of tap water at centrifuge across the way - when I asked for a second one some manager said "while hakkasan is open we can't serve tap".  This I extremely dangerous in a setting where there is an obligation to stay in the club given the no reentry policies in the setting of capacity overload.  There were no obvious water fountains as well. I'm currently reviewing the state statutes regarding the serving of water in restaurants and bars in Nevada and will addend this review for those who are interested.. . 2.  The club was way way over capacity.  This is more dangerous because this club is very poorly designed.  The dance floor especially on the main stage on floor 4 is difficult to access safely and the way the club is designed there is no question in a fire or emergency people would get trampled and die.  It's like a maze, and there are a wall of booths between the bars and the dance floor with only a few winding ramps down to dance floor on the sides of the booths.  With so few access points people get shoved.  When my friend was not feeling well I tried to exit the nearest stairwell near one of the winding ramps with an emergency exit sign, I even told the bouncer at that stairwell it was an emergency and we were leaving and he forced us to navigate through the over capacity club to the main stairwell.  Im considering emailing the fire Marshall at sfm@dps.state.nv.us. . You might consider it too. . . I love Vegas clubs but none is worth losing a life over.
Absolutely love this place! Went in March!  This was my first time there.Tiesto was there and it was nothing less than amazing! Music was great with different rooms to choose from with hip hop and house. The VIP booths are Large and Have a ton of security which is great. The bartenders were super friendly and make great drinks. We didn't have to wait in line which was awesome since the line was a million people long. Most everyone was dressed to impress with some exceptions. This place was one of the highlights of the trip! I recommend experiencing this place if your going to Vegas, It will probably be one of your most memorable nights to say the least!
Don't believe any promoter who is trying to get you in for a cheaper price because there's no way this club will get you in for that price. Read other reviews and you will see similar experiences occur. We came to see a night Steve Aoki was playing and the promotor said it would be $40 for guys and girls in for free. The line was ridiculously long this night. When we finally got to the people with iPads they told us the same 40 for guys and girls free. So we were like cool that sounds good but once we got to the booth they said guys 125 and girls free . We had to pay since we got to the booth around midnight and it was to late to go elsewhere .overall don't believe any promoters cuz at the booth they make u pay another amount !
Saw Calvin Harris on Friday night and Tiesto on Saturday at Hakkasan Nightclub at the MGM this past weekend. I bought my tickets online from the website Las Vegas EDM Event Calendar. The order was processed by WantTickets.com. I was so glad I got the tickets in advance. Why? Because apparently if you pay for them in advance vs. just having them waiting for you at Will-Call  you can bypass 99% of the people in line. We walked up each night to see 100's of people waiting in lines for VIP, Will-Call, Guests, etc. and we walked right passed them and into the club. . . The club is like a cavernous maze covering multiple floors. There are elevators and ramps inside, but stairs are everywhere. The main floor where the DJ is is one level and then you go up to a Pavillion and there is a club in side a club up there. Anyway, you can just wander around until you find a spot that suits your mood. Unless you get table service you'll be standing - same as most clubs. We opted to stand, not worth table service unless you have a good group or have lots of cash to burn. . . As far as the patrons, there was a mix of age groups each night but skewed south of 40 with a heavy concentration of mid-20's to mid-30's. For reference we are 44 & 49. Like any EDM club, the place is packed, loud and filled with heavy partying. The bar is 4 and 5 deep it may take a while to get a drink sometimes. We had a great time. . . http://electronic-vegas.com/vegas-edm-event-calendar/. . https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203891810597249&set=a.10203864061223532.1073741886.1280702242&type=1&theater
