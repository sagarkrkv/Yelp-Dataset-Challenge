The service and the food was excellent.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  We were a larger group of 7 and the waiter was exceptionally attentive. We gave the waiter a target price per person and he ordered the full meal for us from appetizers, to entrees, to desert and the waiter did a great job!
Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.. . As a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, . . Food was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like.
So let me start by saying we went for happy hour, when seated at our table we asked about happy hour but had to sit somewhere else, bar or "lounge" we sat in the lounge. Ok, that is not a lounge. It's a waiting area with a few small tables and I felt awkward sitting there to eat, but whatever we came for the food, I let it go. Mojito is awesome. Recommend it. We ordered a small order of oysters (just two $5 each) to me that seems a bit extreme as I have gone places where I can get a half or a dozen for a better price. But they were really good and presented nicely. Food was good, our first order came out pretty fast. Our waitress was working the bar as well, so after out first order finished, we waited about 10-15 minutes for her to come back, she was busy, I was trying to be patient. Only thing that saved it is she was very very sweet and remembered our large orders with no second guessing it. Food was good, just seemed pricy for such a small quantity. I love my yellowtail and jalapeno, get it everytime I go for sushi, there plate only had two pieces, when usually I'm served a lot more pieces. Again, very good. But it left me wanting more cause there was so little.
"Professor in the Mist". . Pretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. Eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. Yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. I wish I remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, I was much too smitten to remember such a detail.. . Dad ordered his usual Scotch and Mom and I opted for plain water. As we looked over the fare--a Japanese/South American type blend--I kept stealing looks at The Professor. She caught me a few times but neither of us cared. Both of us smiled, in fact. It was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. That aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. A raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. Perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.. . Anyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from The Professor my dad finally settled on sea bass(miso) and Peruvian corn with a side of roasted vegetables. Mom went with a single samba roll which contained Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. And as for me, I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with purple mashed potatoes. . . The verdict?. . Perhaps everything was fine. I never really know when with my parents. Their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. You can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. To wit: Dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). Mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. Kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). And me? I always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so I think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a Large Plate I wish there had been more bird and buds.. . Eventually The Professor laid our check on the table, and Dad swiped it up before I could, although I must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. He gave his usual 15% tip and we departed Sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of The Palazzo Hotel/Casino. . . I guess we might have had a nice time there(I can't really be sure) but this much I do know: Mist or no mist, The Professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....
You can't go wrong with their appetizer and small dishes here. We particularly like rock shrimp tempura (crispy outside and extra soft inside!!), tuna tataki, agedashi tofu!. . We ordered the popular miso sea bass large plate, but we think it was ok not that special. . . We really don't like japanese wagyu tobanyaki 2oz because they use coconut cream which makes everything way too creamy and heavy. I don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too. . . However, their dessert is awesome! We LOVE their Peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! Don't let the name fools you. It may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special. They somehow use chocolate crumble to mix with chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream and cherry sauce is perfect combination!!!! Would come back here again for the dessert itself.
Definately one of my favorite spots to eat when I come to Vegas!I would NOT trade this restaurant for anything!!! Service is incredible, everything here is delicious, my favorite is the Peruvian corn with Sea Bass appetizer and Sushi!!! A little pricy but you definately get what you pay for!!!
Have been coming to Sushi Samba for 6+ years. Always enjoy the happy hour. Yaz and Megan are like old friends and fantastic bartenders. This year I brought my team of 10 and sat in the restaurant for the first time ever. Isabella "Bella" Mostrous greeted me an said that she would take care of everything. I told her we had one with a shellfish allergy, one pregnant and Muslim, her husband, and a vegan. She nailed it!  No one had any issue and the food was fantastic. My boss was the one with the allergy and she took special care not to cross contaminate the food. The next day I kept getting compliments. It was a memorable experience. That's what you want in Vegas, a memorable experience. Jason the manager also got in on the action and treated us with a cool tower of strawberry drinks. He even made sure to have 2 non-alcoholic ones for us so all could enjoy. I just can't say enough about tho place. Go and enjoy.
This place is overrated. The sushi is just okay.
My friends and I went to Sushisamba to celebrate a bachelorette party. We were very excited to try this place since it had been recommended by several friends. We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately. However, after 15-20 minutes, no waiter came by to introduce themselves or get our drink order. Long story short, several managers came over to apologize, brought over a round of drinks and dessert, and made sure our every need was looked after. Our waiter, Mike D, was extremely friendly and helpful too. Some of the girls in the group had special dietary needs. He made this a priority and ensured all the food came out properly. Also, some of the girls in the group did the tasting menu and Mike D picked out some amazing dishes! I would definitely recommend doing the tasting menu since you get a sampling of so many different items. Overall, Sushisamba had amazing food and service and really made it a memorable experience for our whole party. We would definitely go back again! Thanks Mike D!!
Expensive for sushi since the rolls are $25 and they are pretty tiny. Yet, the impeccable taste always has me coming back. The tuna sashimi with apple is a must along with the A5 pot stickers. I had a bunch of rolls and the sea bass skewers. I'm sure I had more but I just can't remember right now. Everything is pretty good. This is my 3rd visit to this restaurant. $150 for 2 without any drinks.
It is very difficult for me to express how amazing my dining experience was at Samba Sushi. The waitress was super fun and helpful. We went there with the hopes of experiencing a "one of a kind" dining experience and we had just that. Our waitress (can't remember her name because it is Japanese) was really wonderful we told her to bring us some exciting options. She guided us through the menu and helped us choose some great options. We had a fifteen piece Chef's choice that included mini crabs, foie gras, caviar, oysters, and some other types of fish. Absolutely delightful. It was the perfect blend of tasty and adventurous. After the first plate we began to get very intrigued about the food and decided to order a selection of sashimi dishes which was also phenomenal. I have never tasted such amazing fish in my life. Having spent nearly $180 dollars on a meal for two, I was more than satisfied. We'll worth the wait and the price. I can't wait to eat here again in the future!
I have been dining at Sushi Samba since it opened the doors in Las Vegas.. . The food, servers, and overall experience of this Restaurant is "Impeccable".. . We usually ask our server to order our food items for us at a minimum spend of. . $50-70 dollars.  We have never been disappointed.  . . Make sure you order the Sea Bass, and Kobi Beef Taco's.  If you are really in the mood . . to have your pallet infused with flavour order  5oz"s of the Kobi Beef.  . . For drinks  a must have is the Mojito's.  . . Enjoy!
Chilean sea bass.  Amazing.  Green envy roll.  Amazing!  Little fish tacos with onion foam- not on the menu- fantastic!  this is always first on the menu list when we come to Las Vegas!
I came here with a group of friends last weekend. The restaurant itself was pretty cool, but the sushi wasn't the greatest. It's definitely expensive, and I've had WAY better sushi at restaurants that are a third of the price. . . When we were there, they were having karaoke night. No one even got up to sing, and some employee was circling the restaurant trying to get people to sing. . . The cocktails were good, but very expensive. I paid $14 for a cocktail that was maybe 5 ounces.
I came here with my friends a little late night. The hostess wasn't the friendliest person in the world. Long dark hair, boots.  We sat in a booth and weren't greeted right away. Waited at least 10 minutes for a greeting or a waiter. Before we even got water the manager Jason personally took our drink order and recommended his personal favorite menu items. It was nice of him considering our initial experience. Our waitress who I choose to keep anonymous was never as attentive.
Food is great.  High end sushi.  Josh the mgr hooked us up with a few apps on the house.  Bad part:  Our server was terrible. Christy or something like that.  She needs to go work at Denny's with an attitude like that.  Won't be going back.
Our foody friends really like this place so two weeks ago we decided to make a visit before seeing book of moron. Early Saturday evening andwe pull up to an empty bar, grab two seats and wait and wait until the bartender gal comes over. Get menus and again wait to put in drink orders.  Asked her a couple questions about the portion sizes and got a useless response. So anyways we order a couple of Tapas,  and like 20 minutes later- our filet ordered Medium rare shows up sliced and medium well ! Really like we weren't going to notice ? Sent that back, waiting another 15 minutes for its replacement which was very tasty. Our other Tapa was an eggplant dish the size of toothpicks, again tasty but crazy $$ considering that a whole eggplant is like $2- So long story short we ran out of time to experiment with any other dishes and had to run to the show on basically an empty stomach after dropping $70- What a joke..
Everytime I stay at the Palazzo, I must eat at Sushi Samba.  Although it's definitely on the pricier side, it's really worth the money.  And hey, you're in Vegas, and you can't be cheap in Vegas.  When ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  Because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly Japanese and Brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  Although I tried both, I prefer choosing from the preset menu. This way I don't get something I don't particularly enjoy.  . . Out of what I've tried so far, my favorites are the Sao Paulo roll, the sea bass antichucho, and the garlic butter scallops.  The Sao Paulo roll is a wonderful combination of scallops, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  The sea bass has a miso glaze and comes with Peruvian corn.  The scallops are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.  But they're basically their Peruvian bay scallop on a half shell, smothered in this delicious garlicky butter reduction.  Can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu!
I should mention the one star rating is primarily based on two factors:. . 1- the Kumamoto oysters they served were bad.  Like old and spoiled bad.  It took half the remainder of my dinner to get the taste out of my mouth from one of them.. 2 - No Brazilian beer.   I ordered a Brazilian lager and 10 minutes later was told they were out of it.  I then ordered a South American Pilsner and they were out of that.  I then decided not to drink.  After mentioning the oyster quality to our server, the manager asked what they could do.  Well, they found that Pilsner they were out of.. . The sushi was decent, but not exceptional. The Brazilian fish stew was rather boring, the coconut rice, beans and quinoa about average and the grilled eggplant not so good.  I was hoping for the eggplant that Sensei can deliver.. . Tables are very small for the larger number of dishes and it's extremely loud.. . I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion.  I haven't been to Peru, but feel that Brazilian cuisine is about as good as  English food.. . Perhaps I would have liked their Wagyu beef, but at $32/oz. and the seeming lack of kitchen talent, I decided not to try it.
Are you staying at the Palazzo? Scratch that, are you staying in VEGAS ? Wait no--- Do you live in NEVADA ???  This place is a MUST. I've been 3 times now and cant wait to go back. Is it a little expensive? maybe, but  you're in Vegas... Listen this place has it all-- The staff is amazing. They go above and beyond here- you get what you pay for- they are fast with the food- the drinks are AWESOME. HUGE Props to the restaurant manager Jason. Very professional- checked in on us often and even made some recommendations that were jaw dropping. I understand that this is what a normal place should be like but coming from the industry myself- many places aren't. The music was upbeat- the bartenders were having a great time with their customers at the bar-- All in All, I love this place. I cant stay in Vegas and NOT come here. Ask for Ryan as your server- Tell Jason that I sent you :) . . Thank you Jason and Ryan for the great time- another amazing Vegas trip with our friends and good memories to last as long as we can remember.
Been to Sushi Samba Las Vegas a few times in the past couple years. About a year ago brought a group of clients there and the service and total experience was horrible !! The waiter left halfway through the meal and the staff totally forgot about us . I swore I would never go back . Returned to Vegas back in May . The clients wanted sushi. I figured the service was ok before that experience give it one more try. Then I met Vanessa Gonzalez . Im a designer and bring clients all over the country for dinners . This dinner was one of the best I've had . She was phenomenal !! Her recommendations were top notch . The service was unreal ! We loved the whole experience so much we returned a month later and was even happier. I asked for her of course and she outdid herself .  She is the reason i will be a frequent customer at this restaurant .
This place is one in a million! From start to finish the service is excellent! The food was to die for! It was my second time back and my husbands first time! The restaurant manager Allen Holmes brought us out a welcome back dish, they were these amazing seasoned and cooked scallops! To die for! Our waitress Stacey was a doll!  I will absolutely be back every time I'm in Vegas!!!
Before our night out on the town, we needed to fuel ourselves with some yummy food. To take the guess work out of trying to figure out what everyone wants, we went ahead with the $50 Omakase dinner.. . Our waiter went around the table & asked all 8 of us our likes & dislikes so the chef can come up with our own custom menu. My favorite dishes of the night were the Grilled sea bass skewer & the A5 Kobe gyoza. To show the attentiveness of the restaurant: 1 of our friends cannot eat spicy food so she got her very own portion of filet mignon instead of the spicy beef skewers.. . In additional to the delicious food & great service, we also got a round of pina colada & our bride-to-be got a beautiful chocolate dessert.. . We had a wonderful dinner followed by a fun night of show watching, dancing, & boozing. Whether you are with a big group or only with a few good friends, this is a great place for a delicious & creative meal.
Really amazing place. My friends and I went there for lunch randomly (I wanted to watch a world cup game) and we were pleasantly surprised. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and the food was fresh and delicious. I got the brazilian feijoada dish (basically black beans, meat, and rice) and it was filling and tasty. We liked it so much we returned for dinner the same evening! Highly recommend.
