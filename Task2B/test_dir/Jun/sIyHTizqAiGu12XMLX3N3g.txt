Is this place better than Wicked Spoon? Probably.  But would I come back, probably not.  We came on a Tuesday night at 8:30pm and yes it took an hour.. just to enter.  The only time you should wait that long for food, is if they are handing it out for free. People talk about great service, ours was craptastic to say the least.  . . I always believed you shouldn't pay gratuity up front, so that your waiter would be more inclined to work for their tip.  Having no cash for a tip after, I decided to leave an up front 20% tip ($20) to our server.  And sure enough we ended up with one, whose only responsibility mind you is to clear plates and make sure your drinks are full, who loved to disappear for 15 minutes at a time.  On one instance, my gf made eye contact with her and waved to her to come, she completely ignored her and walked away.  ??????  This may have been an anomale since it was my first time, but the 5 times I've been to Wicked Spoon, i've experienced above average service.  . . Other than that.  The only disappointment, was that there was no bone marrow which is the only reason I would go to Wicked Spoon over this place, well plus it usually takes less than 10 minutes to be seated.. . The Oysters were good, crab legs were salty from preservatives. theres was this white saucy shooter with salmon that was awesome. Brisket was salty. dolmades good.  tabouli was meh, wicked spoon's waaay better.  asian section here WAY better than wicked.  salad bar not so  much. menudo had NO tripe, wth.  deserts were real good, I would say tied with wicked.. . Again at $51 per person, a bad first experience with our server and an hour+ wait time, i'd just go to Wicked Spoon if I really want to eat a buffet.  The selection here is BETTER don't get me wrong, but seriously, that wait time just to eat... . . PS:  right before you enter, there are two lines that go left and right.  THERE WAS NO SIGN to direct large parties to the right and smaller parties to the left.  My gf and I went right, and about halfway in, some lady with a camera tells us we were in the long line, which extended our wait time by another 10 minutes.  At $51 per person, you would think they would have enough money to make a sign.
Not worth the $53.99 on a sat night. I mean if there's gonna be a price hike on the weekend then at least complement it with higher quality food. I really didn't see anything that would have justified the price. There was no lobster, rib eye, foie gras, or brontosaurus. It was said they had King crab, but what they actually had was a blend of snow crab and small king crab legs that were the same size as the snow crabs. They did have some miso glazed seabass which saved them from a 2 star rating. . . The best part of the buffet was their dessert bar. They had frozen mochi, macarons, cake pops, chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato, and great toppings for ice cream. Presentation of all these were very exquisite.. . Although the dessert was awesome, it isn't what I would pay $54 for. You would think for the 2hr wait and another hr to get seated, it would be life changing but it's far from. You still see the Chinese food, corn on the cob, pizza, tacos, and other ordinary offerings you'd see at Hometown Buffet. If you want to experience this place, I'd suggest coming on a non-fri or sat night.
If you're in Las Vegas, you must check out this buffet. It's the B-O-M-B. Pricey, but worth it. It's over $50 bucks per person during dinner. Arrive early or grab a reservation ticket in advance to avoid the long wait. . . Like any other Asian, I love crab legs at a buffet. It's the best way to get my money's worth. Having said that, I hate how most Vegas buffets slice the crab legs down the middle. It actually makes it harder to get the meat for us crab enthuiast. At least they warm the legs up in boiling water prior to serving, which can be requested at the Italian section. Jumbo chilled shrimp? Yes!. . This place even serves pho, which is actually not too bad for a buffet. It's not OMG amazing, but it's excusable. Try it out yourself and you'll know what I mean.. . You'll hate yourself if you're seated next to the dessert section. It's that good. They have unlimited mochi ice cream. Yes, unlimited. No joke. Not as many flavors as last time, but I'm not complaining. I was content with the green tea and vanilla options.. . Check this place out. I recommend it. Although I was not as excited coming here my second time, the buffet is still hands down a great eat.
This place is amazing. They have everything you could think about wanting to eat. The hard part is restraining yourself. Come with plans to stay awhile. Some of the best items are made to order so keep that in mind as well. The price is very steep for the vegetarian crowd. At 68 bucks it's really not worth it, but when you're in Vegas and you have to buffet I would definitely come here. The service is top notch as well.

Referred to as a "crown jewel" by its new executive chef and purporting a "feast for the Gods" a visit to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet comes with certain self-appointed expectations and although prices have crept upward since the sprawling space opened to the public I can only say that my $47.50 Saturday Brunch, complete with bottomless champagne, was worth every cent.  Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more "American," one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.. . Slightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although "Gods" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.
i'm not sure how you can find out the prices without calling caesars palace. we paid $54.99 each for a non-holiday sunday dinner. lots of vegetarian options. crab legs were adequately defrosted. nigiri and roll sushi were passable--excellent by buffet standards. i think this has surpassed the wicked spoon in terms of the best vegas buffet, with bellagio and wynn close behind.. . highlights:. mushroom polenta. beet salad...ok, hard to go wrong with this one. mochi ice cream...ditto. do it yourself congee, with all the toppings...dried pickled radish, 1000 year egg, fried garlic, wonton strips, green onions...the whole shebang! . . for those who care, the carving station included:. individual lamb chops in a sweet marinade. prime rib. brisket. chicken sausage. another type of sausage. . bathroom was outside and fairly small--this was annoying.
I was very impressed with the buffet. They offered warm crab legs that are split in half so this I definitely a plus. Their sushi and dim sum was really good I had so many dumplings! The have a good variety of meat selections, ranging from prime rib, to chicken and sausage. The oysters were also very good and bigger than at other buffets. You get what you pay for and this is defiantly worth it. Dinner is about $60 a person but you will definitely be happy when you are done
Since opening 2-3 years ago, Bacchanal Buffet inside Caesars Palace has become the premier buffet location in Las Vegas, and it is definitely my first choice!!. . I am pretty sure Bacchanal Buffet has won "Best Buffet in Las Vegas" each of the past 2-3 years, and it is for good reason. Caesars spent over $17 million renovating and decorating the space for Bacchanal, and it looks absolutely gorgeous inside. The presentation is spot-on, and even the tables, chairs, and surrounding decorations are very impressive. But who goes to a buffet to see nice chairs? Not many people, so let's talk about the food.. . First of all, I recommend going for dinner, but come early, because the line can get pretty gnarly. Even though it's $54.99 per person, it is well worth it! There are a few key items that you MUST get: 1) Alaskan king crab legs (and get them steamed), 2) freshly shucked oysters, 3) peeled tiger shrimp, 4) ribeye lollipop, 5) lamb chops, 6) fresh-made tacos, and 7) chocolate-infused souflee. These 7 are the MUST try's if you are a first time visitor.. . They also have a wide assortment of great Asian, Italian, Mexican, BBQ, and seafood dishes, and the largest dessert spread you will probably see in your entire life, unless you are royalty in a foreign country. The food is very well-prepared, and made extremely fresh. They are served in/on very modern dish ware, as well, adding to the impressive presentation.. . My only complaints are the following:. . 1) The line can be over 90 mins long, which is a little ridiculous for a buffet. I've seen people leave just because of the line. It doesn't create the best experience, but it's tough to justify that wait when you can go elsewhere.. . 2) The price is $54.99 for dinner, which is rather steep. This is a once-in-a-while splurging type of experience. It isn't an everyday "where do we go for dinner tonight?" type of place.. . 3) The waiter/waitress service isn't that great. Each waiter/waitress takes care of so many tables, and it takes forever to get drinks and to get the tables cleared of old plates, etc.. . In any case, we will be back to Bacchanal next time we are in Vegas. Super miss those crab legs, oysters, ribeye lollipop and lamb chops. This is no ordinary buffet - I guarantee you'll love it!
The best buffet I've been to, anywhere and everywhere. High-class super premium quality in both food and presentation. Love the oysters and peeled jumbo shrimp. The fresh Mexican juices/drinks was a nice surprise -- especially the Horchata and Tamarind. Cold and warm steamed crab legs, Chinese including Peking duck, and an authentic Italian offering (with cheeses and salami) round out an internationally eclectic menu that seems to have been designed for a top notch non-buffet restaurant.  Amazing dessert selection. Fast efficient service, including self-pay kiosks while waiting in line. I highly recommend this place -- pay the extra $10-$20 and enjoy a truly one-of-a-kind buffet! A+ 5 stars ******
Bacchanal- rated #1 buffet of Las Vegas. We decided to try it on the first day first meal of our weekend trip to LV. Found out no oyster for lunch. We waited 3 hrs to get in for dinner with oyster. Luckily. We went in at 2:30 ish and paid for lunch price but getting dinner dishes right by 3 o'clock. The selection wasn't that versatile. But mostly high quality stuff. So other than what you can get at every buffet, I mainly ate a bunch of cold crab legs, cooked crab legs and whole lot of oysters. The oysters are huge and fresh. After all the seafood and sweets, it is totally worth the money even for a girl like me who can't eat that much. . Last but not least, we got there sat afternoon, no line no wait!!!!. P. S. The bf was surprised not only the standard prime rib but the smoked brisket. I Donno what's the big deal about the brisket but he was impressed. . Another note. Be prepare for five hours of food coma!!!!!!!!
Hands down the best buffet I've ever eaten at! I pretty much died & went to food heaven.. . It's a bit pricey, $50 per person for dinner, but it's so worth it! (At least for the amount of food I ate, anyway).. . You could taste the freshness of the seafood. I felt that they had a huge selection within each area of food that they had. Their selection of food ranged from American, Mexican, Italian, & Asian. I felt like the ethnic food they offered was pretty much authentic tasting. It didn't taste 'Americanized' if that makes sense. I don't know what else to say about the food except that I pretty much tried every dish that they offered & I loved each & every one of them!. . The desserts were really good too! Loved that they had a gelato bar. & the best part was they had green tea cookies the night I went. Not only were they green tea cookies, but they were red bean-filled green tea cookies!!. . I can't wait to come back!
I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:. . Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber. Smoked salmon & cold shrimp. Steak & egg. Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots. Fried chicken and waffles. Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange. . There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.. . The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.. . On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.. . The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.. . I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.
WOW!!!! That's all i can say. Im a big guy 6ft 305lbs so obviously i love to eat, and this buffet is hands down the best in town for selection and quality. It is a little on the pricey end but for what you pay if you can eat that much its well worth it. Multiple kinds of meat from steak,chicken,pork,sausage and many many more all ready to cut and serve. When i wenti did not eat the whole day before going and def got my money's worth. I would recommend this if you are really and hungry and want to enjoy an array of good quality foods.
Awesome buffet. 3 years ago I saw a few signs that said Spices Buffet at planet hollywood was voted the best. So we tried it and it sucked. Then 2 years ago I saw signs that said Bacchanal buffet was voted the best. But was hesitant because I was lied to before with the Spices Buffet.  This year I see they're still ranked at #1 so decided to try it. IT WAS AWESOME!!!. . I had about 8 glasses of different juices. Strawberry, Guava, Jamaican, and mango! The food is very good also. The buffet is well organized. you have to check in at the terminal and they let you know what time to come back.  We went on a thursday around 8:30pm and had to come back at 8:50.  It was pretty crowded. After that it only took about 5 mins to be seated.
The only buffet in Las Vegas that is worth the hype! Delicious, fresh and authentic cuisines from all around the world.  If you love Italian charcuterie, you will be in heaven, and this from a girl who normally prefers bread above all things! Fabulous service, but do yourself a favor and stop by the kiosk to get a seating time at least 2 hours before you think you'll be ready to eat, they'll text you when your seat is ready (or you can just show up at the appointed time).
Amazing, high quality buffet! Definitely recommend you try the tacos which are prepared fresh to order. Service could have been a little better in terms of refills and condiments.
The best buffet in Vegas so far,  get the ticket at 5:00, just wait 10 min, you can get call to pay for dinner.. The food inside has variety choice and dish are just delicious, each portion is small that you don't need to worry that waste the extra food.. The crab leg was cut well, you can enjoy it easily, the oyster is fresh and sweet.. The dessert taste great, especially their Macaron, very chewy.. We will definitely come back if the rate still good next time.
Had lunch here on a Friday and in terms of buffet food, the food here was pretty darn good. . . Started out with a seafood plate of king crab legs, shrimp, and oysters. The crab was my favorite--the meat was sweet and delicious!. . Then moved onto a charcuterie plate that was decent but nothing to write home about. . . Next got some congee at the asian food station. Grandma would have berated me (such cheap food! Waste of stomach space!), but it was so good. . . Then came the tacos--get the pork. . . Then a return to the king crab legs and some more shrimp cocktail.. . Finally some truffle mushroom soup (so surprisingly delicious!) and this amazing parmesan cheesy cracker crisp thing...noms. . . Oh and I'm not really one for sweets but the green tea creme brulee was on point. . . Overall, lots of options for everyone. The boy got lots of the meats--wagyu beef sliders and prime rib cuts. Those were also pretty dece. Quality isnt as good as you can get at some restaurants but it's certainly the best quality I've ever had at a buffet.
I never eat at buffets  but when I do....  I'm highly disappointed and disgusted . So much variety,  yet not one delicious dish.  I love quality,  I guess I will have to be content with quantity.  But I won't,  I refuse to conform to the masses.. . The wait time here for dinner after 3pm ranges from hour and a half to three hours.  You get a ticket stamped with a time to come back at.  Once you're in,  you are seated and then you can join the frenzy of other dinners trying to grab the "best of the buffet".  The best probably being the crab legs and oysters. Or the California rolls (they call it sushi) or a mosh posh of pasta , Mexican ground beef hard shell tacos,  Chinese chop suey or overly mayo clams.  U pick your poison. . . When everything is said and done or half eaten you're left with a full belly of despair and dissatisfaction. .  . Next time family or friends come in from out of town,  they're on their own if the suggest we eat at a buffet.
Starting to go downhill.. . 2nd visit in May 2014, one of the hosts was really rude to us.  As was one of the cooks at the meat carving station.. . 3rd visit in June 2014 someone needs to regulate the lines.  and the food wasn't as good.  the meat was terrible.  brisket seasoning was subpar.  and the prime rib was really dry.. . Pho, Tacos, Sliders, Crab Legs, Beef Chow Fun were all good.
Absolute best buffet I have EVER been to. Rated number 1 for a reason. I went here with my parents on Friday night around 7 pm and we only had to wait in line 15 minutes. Yes, it's a very pricey buffet, but everything in Vegas is expensive. A bottle of water can be $3 there! I've been to many buffets in Vegas and they don't come close to this one. Plus, I'm a very picky eater (unfortunately), but there was so much food that I loved. They have brisket, prime rib, sushi, fried rice, crab legs, shrimp, baked potatoes, lots of bread, deli meats and cheeses, made to order tacos, Mexican rice, salad bar, grilled veggies, and SO MUCH MORE! The dessert selection is just beyond amazing. I've never seen so much dessert in my life. I wish I could've tried it all. I did try the coconut macaroon, ice cream, cheesecake, and chocolate covered strawberries. All very delicious, but I must say, the strawberries were my favorite. . GO TO THIS BUFFET! It's worth every penny!!!!
I have gone to a lot of the Buffets in Las Vegas and this one blew my mind. Excellent choices, great quality and above all, excellent flavor. I went during the Memorial Day Weekend with family and friends and although it is expensive, I can understand why. They had so many choices for everyone that at first I was overwhelmed. There are alternatives for the big eater, the vegan/vegetarian and the diet conscious. The food is cooked at each station in from of you so you know it is fresh. The seafood station was incredibly good. Also impressive was the Steak/BBQ station. They have also Mexican, Italian, Asian and Greek stations. There is also a soup station. The dessert area is also impressive with lots of high qualitychoices. Overall, it was an excellent experience. Highly recommended.
Came on a Thursday night around 8:00 pm.  Probably waited less than 20 minutes.  Compared to how much food costs in Vegas in general I think Bachannal is a excellent deal.  The crab legs and shrimp cocktail were really good.  The oysters on the other hand were pretty bland.  i really liked the wagyu beef slider but it does fill you up.  Also there was a polento thing with truffles which was crazy good.. . After eating here,  I was really glad i didn't buy the Buffet of buffets.. i could not imagine eating anything else for at least 24 hours.
After reading USA Today's review ( http://www.usatoday.com/experience/las-vegas/best-of-vegas/vegas-buffets-five-to-find/1991653/) that this was the best buffet in Vegas,  I decided to give it a shot.   The review deemed this place unique,  but I would not totally agree.   The venue is beautiful,  and not your typical "stuff your face fatty" environment.   It's nicely finished,  and gives you the feel like you are in a bubble.   That's really where the uniqueness ends.   . Service is par for any buffet, so don't expect anything better than the service you get at an Old Country Buffet.   The staff was friendly though,  but it would have been a huge WOW factor if they knew our names,  even a first name woukd have WOW'd me.   . . The food selection is nothing all that special.   I really expecter a better quality and variety than what was there.   Don't get me wrong,  the glutny of US culture is well represented and the sorority girl types will have to pull the trigger a few times if they want to try everything that fancies them,  but it didn't meet my WOW expectation.   I expected more seafood, meats,  and non typical buffet foods.   When you dedicate 10% of you buffet to pizzas that are not all that great,  then you lose me. . . Suggestions:. 1.)  You can really up the service here to get an edge.   . 2.)  Go less typical pizza and be inventive.   Have some deep dish pizza,  goat cheese,  and other unique stuff.  . 3.)  The Chinese food is insulting,  and is really just Chinese-American take out.   How about authentic Chinese food? . 4.)  Seafood was below par,  and Atlantic City's Borgota has you beat hands down.   Yes Atlantic City!  I hope I woke you up on this one.   How about some Lobster meat for $60?  . . Compliments . 1.) Loved,  loved,  loved the brisket!   This is some of the best brisket meat a I have ever had!   It's easily in the top 5,  and probably top 2.  Can I get that recipe? . 2.)  Dessert bar was awesome... You can't go wrong with any selection.   Great unique style and different flavors (i.e.  Green tea creme brullette).   . . In the end,  I don't see what makes this the best buffet in Vegas when compared to other buffets across the country I have been too.   If this is really the best,  then I probably won't try others (realize that I am writing this while eating breakfast at the Wicked Spoon Buffet).
Downgraded to a solid 4. Wynn and Cosmo outdo here now. They ran out of King crab, so they served whatever was left from day before an blended in a very few pieces with the snow crab to fool the customer (doesnt work) and then they ran out completely. This was for Sunday brunch early morning.
Decided to try this place out since Wicked Spoon has always been the go-to spot.. . Wrong decision but at least now I know. . . The decor is really nice. I like the comfy chairs. . . Service: hm..my water stayed empty til the end. . . Food: average for the price of $44 for brunch. No real stand-out dishes. The hargow was terrible. So fake. The sweet buns were good. I love bacon so the breakfast area with bacon was cool. Hashbrowns were tasty. Sushi was sushi, not bad. Mac n cheese shouldn't get messed up, but they did, not that flavorful. I think my fave dish was the au gratin potatoes, it tasted like there was truffle cheese. I don't know because there was no label. I was expecting more macarons too but no luck. Dessert was sub-par.. . It was an experience... I'll stick to Wicked Spoon next time.
I got in right away since my party was already inside but they waited less than 20 min on a Friday night, maybe it was a slow weekend.  I went straight for steamed king crab legs.  I believe this is the only buffet that serves steamed king crab legs?  Let me tell you, I won't be eating refrigerated cold crab meat ever again in Vegas.  It's ridiculously delicious when warm and dip it in butter.  Too bad they only serve you one plate at a time!  After many plates of crab legs, got a plate of oysters.  They were pretty good, they could have done a better job cleaning/rinsing so they won't be so gritty.  To finish my meal, got a plate or two of prime rib with au jus, I thought it was little too salty for my taste but good none the less.  I didn't try every single thing they offered since I was too busy filling myself with crab meat.  I got my money's worth just from king crab legs.  Yum!
THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAV BUFFET! . . PRICE: $$$$. -breakfast $20+. -lunch $30+. dinner $50+. You are paying for an awesome buffet with so many different stations with unlimited, quality food. It is definitely worth it!. . WHAT TO TRY:. -red velvet pancakes. -hand made dim sum. -pho. -baked to order souffles. -oxtail soup. -fresh oysters. . and can't forget: DESSERT:. -hand made crepes topped with fruit and other toppings. -sorbet and gelato. -macarons. -creme brulee. . Only downfall is the wait! Expect an hour or two wait in line . . . but hey, you're in Vegas . . . its expected!!!
Buffet of all buffets. . Ive tried a lot of buffets in vegas, but no one ends up giving this experience. The food is high quality combined with a personal touch from every chief behind the counter. Since buffets are a mandatory "Vegas thing" u might as well try this one to get the best. Pricing is a bit steep and they are slowly raising it, but i would say its def. worth it. . . Go there a weekday before 6:30 to dodge the line or end up waiting for an hour or two. Weekends are crazy and you should try be there before 5:45 to just stroll in, and watch the line explode behind you.. . This one is also included in CET 24h buffet pass, but its only available for a additional fee.. . Remember that you dont have to go big on a buffet. Go there early, enjoy the food and experience a good buffet without value seeking cravers!
I went to the Bacchanal Buffet this past Friday night. It was NG. I really do not think it is worth what I paid. My husband and I have heard how great the buffet was. We were excited about going to try it because they claim they are the best buffet in Vegas. We paid $116.73 for two. Alcohol is an additional charge. We had two glasses of white wine for $18 including the tip. The total bill was about $135 for two people.. I saw a dirty, disgusting spot on the chair when the host seated me. They switched the chair for me when I pointed out the problem to them. However, they simply swapped it with a chair from another table.. . The food selection was low. There was an Asian section. Chinese dishes were typical cheap American Chinese food. Crab was soaked in a heavy soy sauce starch gravy.  There was a couple of dim sum. The fillings of those dishes were not fresh, skin was on the thick side. On top of that, they really did not taste that good. Japanese food included a few typical rolls and they were mediocre at best. My husband tried the pizza, he said it was all right. If you like cheese, you will not find any good ones here. The selection was poor, and they were old and cheap. I tried yellow cheddar, white cheddar and Brie, and that was pretty much all they had. . . Italian assuage was OK. Sea bass was terrible. They were cold and old. Crab legs has nothing special to mention. Dessert was just OK. I have had better ones somewhere else. I am disappointed about them. They said the buffet included soft drinks, but that does not include latte. I chose the coffee at the end of the meal. It was not that good at all. I believe it was cheap coffee. . . Overall, I believe they have cut corners. The ingredients are on the cheap side. Believe me, there is no such thing as dishes made to order on the spot. It turned out to be false talk that they have been putting in people's ear. I truly regret going there. I ended up eating some cheap (at a high price) food that I normally do not eat. My definition for this buffet is "cheap" ingredients + American cooking techniques + fancy name ( I am looking at you BACCHANAL) = TV dinner in Caesars Palace . I HATE IT. If you do not believe me, please go find out by yourself. . if you need any advice where to eat in Vegas (and it probably won't cost as much as Bacchanal Buffet) you should try "Joe's Stone Crab" at Cesars, "Social House" for Japanese food in Crystal and "Sushi Roku" in Caesars (with a great strip view) is good to me, along with Mon Ami Gabi in Paris.
They deserve to be called the best buffet in vegas. Probably the only buffet that I consider to be worth the last penny! We came on a Saturday which is typically champagne brunch so a little pricey at $45/person. Nevertheless, my take is still way cheaper compared to going to a fancy steakhouse. The carving section had prime rib, beef brisket and hot links, and were all a hit. They also have a full-on mexican section, which I find unusual but the tacos and guac were spot on.  Great for kids because they have pizza, mac and cheese, and french fries, and they are not fast food quality. The desserts are phenomenal! Especially the caramel flan, green tea creme brulee and gelato. Since it's champagne brunch they serve champagne or mimosa but you could also get regular juices or soda. The servers are fast and friendly.  This buffet is quite a handul folks and there are too much postives about it.  The only negative I could think of is the big line and long wait (average 1 hour), but still not a deal breaker for me.
8 trips to Vegas, and I finally make it to Bacchanal, and it was just about everything I hoped for. The price is steep, with lunch prices comparable to other well regarded Vegas buffets' dinner prices ($34.99 + tax/tip for lunch), but even so I would come back here every time and not think twice.  As per usual, I came about 15 minutes before the dinner switch over (no line on a weekday afternoon), and got to try the best of both worlds at lunch pricing.  . . Highlights:  The brisket, goodness, was the best brisket I have ever had.  I have yet to visit Austin, so I reserve the right to retract this, but it was the perfect combination of tenderness, smoke and seasoning.  Pad thai was also really delicious, and incredibly spicy, which I like.  Other fantastic offerings include wagyu beef sliders, peking duck, sweet potato and truffle tater tots, and rack of lamb.  In fact, a combination of all of the above would probably make my last meal if I face the electric chair.  The desserts were quite varied, from made-to-order ice cream sandwiches, cake pops, green tea creme brulee, crepes, shaved ice and every cake-y dessert imaginable, although I'm not sure anything was super memorable.. . All in all, absolutely the best buffet I've tried in Vegas.  For comparison, I went to Bellagio's weekend dinner the following afternoon and it didn't hold a candle.  I make the cross-country flight to Vegas almost annually, and the chance to relive Bacchanal is one of the few things that entice me to keep the streak going.
I would recommend this buffet to those with an expensive palate. It is usually 50 dollars but because it was memorial day weekend it cost 70. Was it worth it? Yes and no. They use premium ingredients. The seafood bar had lobster claws, the burgers were made from kobe beef and the crab legs are sliced in half which meansNO FIGHTING WITH YOUR FOOD. When you take all that into consideration you can easily eat your money's worth. The buffets is separated by different regions Italy, Mexico, etc.  They had some amazing Mexican soup with tripe and some other odd bist of the animal but it was flavourful. They have an actual pho station, fresh sushi, gourmet meats balls. Whatever you want it is hear. I still wouldn't say it was the best buffet I've ever been to because there was nothing that really stood out to me that I craved after I left. I just loved the fact that they offered things a usual buffet wouldn't offer. You can tell that every station but effort and into their food and it was not rushed. The wait times are absolutely ridiculous (3+ hours) and the customer service was POOR they man who took our payment was not that pleasant and our waitress was nowhere to be found. We had to practically beg her to take our plates because she NEVER did it without a reminder. If this buffet was usually 70 dollars I would not recommend it. For 50 sure but it's a onetime thing. I wouldn't come back. I saw that they had shaved ice cream unfortunately by the time I was ready for dessert they has already started closing the dessert station.. . P.S THE WASTED FOOD AT THE END OF THE NIGHT GETS DONATED TO PIGS..not even people lmao
My first review on Yelp goes to Bacchanal, because they are just that awesome all around in what they do contributing to the buffet scene in Vegas. :D. . First off, the prices. Yes it is expensive for a buffet, especially if you come here for dinner ($50.99, $30 upgrade if you choose to do Buffet of Buffets), but you are not going to regret spending that amount of money once you see the vast diversity of food they have to offer. . . Second, the food. Nowhere else on the Strip can you find the vastquantity and quality of food that Bacchanal has to offer. I've been to many other buffets on the Strip, and none comes close to the titan of buffets that is Bacchanal. Some of the highlights: . . -The seafood selection alone is worth the price of admission. From the fresh oysters on the shell, juicy king crab legs, succulent chilled jumbo shrimps (get it with their horseradish sauce!), and even oyster shooters, it was something truly to behold and enjoy. . -The meat selection is pure heaven. The big ones: their brisket:  perfectly smoked, seasoned just right, and quite literally melts in your mouth. The prime rib was juicy and tender, and with the au jus, nothing comes closer in terms of buffet quality prime rib. . -Dessert: my goodness I didn't even know such desserts could exist under one buffet roof. The made to order crepes, selection of sorbet and gelato flavors, creme brulee, cheesecake pops, berry cobbler, and UNLIMITED MACARONS will certainly make your experience at Bacchanal a sweeeeeet one that you won't forget. . -Some other buffet standouts worth trying: wagyu beef sliders, lobster bisque, oxtail soup, lamb racks, sweet potato tater tots, and the fresh fruit drinks in glass bottles by the meat station. . . Overall, if I were to have a last meal, it would definitely be at Bacchanal. I have no regrets putting down that much money for what I got, and will be coming back for as long as I come back to Vegas. Bacchanal, you have my heart and appetite for life. :)
Decided to try Bacchanal due to all the hype about it being the "best buffet" in vegas. Definitely not the case to me. As others have stated, Bacchanal really didn't 'wow' me. Seafood was decently fresh, there was a noodle stand, meat was not impressive and very much a let down, sushi was distasteful, but the desertswere great..      I don't know how long the seafood was sitting out for, but the shrimp's texture wasn't very good. Otherwise the crab legs and oysters were fine, pretty standard. The meat was a big let down for me. The lamb was extremely dry, and definitely not seasoned enough, same goes for the prime rib. Simply no flavor which is unacceptable. .      Desserts on the other hand were great, lots of variety, the pandan tiramisu definitely took me by surprise, and their gelato wasn't bad either. .      Overall this experience was definitely not worth the dinner price of ~$55, I would most likely go back to Wicked Spoon instead, where food was unique, consistent and fresh.
After having been there half a dozen times more since their opening, I feel an update is warranted. I had to dock a star because I feel their quality & offerings have gone down enough. Albeit still a great buffet, Bacchanal has already started cutting back. A few worth mentioning are the Tomahawk 30 day aged prime rib eye is only offered after a certain time for dinner. A wide variety of mochi ice creams were added to the dessert station about a year ago that I absolutely loved. But now it's been cut back to a couple selections & cookie gelato sandwiches were added.. On the plus side, there doesn't seem to be massively overloaded lines anymore.
It's the Mercedes Benz (AMG edition) of buffets. Gee golly bob did I leave full! My group came at 8:15 am and didn't have to wait in line. I repeat. NO LINE on a Sunday morning. Go figure- everyone else was probably happily sleeping in after their night of raunchy debauchery. I'm not judging because I was there once. This trip however was more food focused!. . For $50 ($40.99 but ball parked to $50 after tax and tip) you get bottomless mimosas or champagne with your meal. The hostess gives you little finger protectors so that you can pick up all the hot plates without scorching a finger or two. They were adorned with the "Bacchanal" logo so I took mine home as a memento :). . The decor is fabulous. My favorite thing being the chandelier made out of wine glasses.. . The food was.... Money. From the prime rib to the crab legs, fancy salads, delectable Asian dishes, fried chicken and dessert items. I mean, seriously? If you're picky you are bound to find something to wet your whistle. Even the sushi was pretty g-double-o-d GoooOd.. . The things that kept me from a 5 star review (minimal, but hey- it's my review buddy!) were inconsistencies. All agreed that the croissant on the ham and cheese sammy was better than the stand alone version. More buttery and crisp! How can that be? Dunno.. The crab bene (or was it lobster) lacked it's featured protein and turned cold once I got back to my table. This occurred with a lot of the hot breakfasty items so I skipped them after my first plate.. . There are way too many choices on the Vegas strip, but try Bacchanal at least once just so you can say you've had it!
Hands down has the most choices and variety of dishes and dessert ive ever seen. I suggest not eating for the whole day to prepare lol. lunch price is a lot cheaper, i think something around 35 dollars compared to dinner 55? They have a lot of seafood for the seafood lovers, and tons of meat selections, prime rib, lamb, pork/beef ribs. Skip the carbs though, itll make you full fast. Desserts are plentiful, tons of sorbet flavors and the list goeson. note, those little things they hand you at the beggining are for picking up hot plates.
This is the best buffet in Las Vegas. For years I have thought it was the one at Rio, but that's simply because I had yet to try this one. I always thought it was too expensive to pay upwards of $30 for a buffet, but I went for the breakfast and it was cheaper for that option, so I bit the bullet. They have all the staples of a breakfast buffet like eggs, bacon, and sausage. But where they really set a new high bar is in the rare choice selection they offer. This is the first buffet I've seen with a whole section devoted to cheese. They also had a juice bar with the type of juices you see at a Robeks or Jamba Juice. Then there was the dessert section that was impressive like none other. Since I am diabetic, the sugar-free section was a welcome sight. There was at least 10 different options of that variety. I sampled three of them and didn't want to hurl like I normally do with sugar-free fare.. . The service staff was also really nice. I got multiple refills on my Diet Coke and never had to wait too long. Me and my girlfriend were also seated in an intimate corner which felt like a private dining area because of the comfortably clothed chairs with arm rests which differed from the wooden chairs in the main dining area.. . I have a feeling this will be the only buffet I eat at in Las Vegas ever again.
This buffet was highly recommended to me as the best buffet in Vegas. I did the Spice Market Buffet the night before so this was definitely a big step up.. The service was greatand the line moved fast. They do a cheesy buffet photo that they try to sell you later for $25. I think this really downgrades the experience. . . The highlights for me were the hot and cold crab stations, custom made taco station and asian noodle soup station. The dessert station has chocolate covered strawberries and macaroons, which I thought was very unique. They also had delicious juices and drinks at the Mexican station. . . Overall, I think this is something everyone should experience once if you can. It's very expensive at $50 per person base + tax + tip, which makes it $65 per person (if you are Canadian the exchange makes it over $70 each, which could be a nice meal somewhere else). If you eat a lot, you can get your monies worth. However, I'm sure the majority of people don't so it's mostly for the experience.
Ok well... I absolutely love this place and this will be my to-go place every time I go to Vegas because it was worth every penny for me. It costed me $55 on a weeknight and was a little heartbroken until I saw the place and food. . . The buffet area is very big. It made me so happy that when I turned every corner there were more foods available. The decor of the place was beautiful. It costed them $100 million to create 'the bucchanel' and I think that they did an amazing job. There were big round tables and booths available. . . I ate the crap out of the cold crab legs. That with butter was OMG. The shrimp was very juicy and FAT. I have never seen a shrimp so fat before. my friend made his own carnita truffle fries because the buffet had all the ingredients available (guac, truffle fries, carnitas, salsa, cheese). . . I ate 8 legs of lamb. So good!! The prime rib and brisket was a bit too salty for my liking but I loved the lamb. . . The desserts were beautifully displayed. Too bad I'm not a sweets kind of person but everything looked so pretty I just had to try everything (and I did...no kidding..) yummy creme Brule, chocolate covered strawberries, cake pop, pudding tart (my favorite because it wasn't too sweet), cookies, and macarons. Loved the lemon and strawberry sorbet.  . . I suggest coming early dinner or 2 hrs before closing to avoid lines. I didn't have to wait because we came late but there were plenty of foods available.
Everything you'd expect from a high end casino's buffet: Huge selection, decent quality foods, and overpriced admission.  I'm not saying that it was a bad experience; On the contrary, I enjoyed my visit.  But to me, in the end the food doesn't justify the price.  I'll elaborate.. . As I mentioned, the food selection is quite extensive and diverse.  It seems every major nationality and ethnicity is represented somewhere in the buffet.  I'll use my gluttony as an example: My first plate consisted of asian-style stir fry and meats, with rice and an Asian soup.  My second plate was build-it-yourself tacos, with middle eastern style doughy stuff and meats.  My third plate was typical American, steak and trip-tip with potatoes and corn. The dessert section is fairly large too- lots of gelatos, cakes, and other sweet treats.  Overall, most of the food quality would range between very good to excellent.. . Now, even though the buffet is tasty and diverse, I still have a few negatives I can't quite get over:. Price- The buffet is great, but it's quality isn't much different from other buffets on the strip.  For example, the quality equals that of Planet Hollywood's buffet, and PH comes in at around $10 cheaper per person, with a shorter wait time. Which leads me to my next point.... Service- If you come during meal times, you're going to wait.  Unless you're a VIP, you wait to pay and wait again to be seated.  From the time we got in line until we got seated took about 40 minutes, which is kind of crazy for a lunch.  And after you're seated, if you're thirsty you are at the mercy of a server and must wait for beverages and refills. Which in our experience, was very lacking and slow. I went through two plates of food with an empty drink, and only received a refill when I flagged down a different passing server. . . So in conclusion, the food was very good and the selection was great.  The price was steep and the service lackluster.  Next time I do a Vegas buffet, I'll probably try somewhere else where the cost is a bit more in line with the value.
You can't escape Vegas without going to at least one buffet. The question? Which one? If you're like me and you come to Vegas once a decade it is all a wild guess though Yelp is of course a blessing. That being said let me take the guesswork out for you and just go to The Bachannal at Caesar's Palace. Had lunch there and my girls were beaming after they left. As you would expect a whole lot to choose from. Definitely eat the waygu bed sliders. Everything from the Asian section was awesome which to me says a lot about the quality. The had a to order taco bar. Shellfish bar. The BBQ section brought a tear to my eye. Sausages. Prime rib. Brisket that you would sell your soul for. The carver at the BBQ station was so nice too. He was smiling away chatting the entire two hours I was there. Wait. Did I just admit I was there for two hours? I swear I didn't eat the entire time. 90 minutes tops! Every dessert under the sky including made to order shaved ice but you have to ask. All there is a little sign in the dessert bar.y daughter saw it got some and loved it even comparing the quality to stuff found in Hawaii.
There was so much hype as I anticipated my arrival to Vegas because of this buffet. It wasn't even about the endless sunshine, unlimited booze, or the crazy escapades that were to come in Sin City. All I cared about was the buffets. Inner fat child fosho.. . I got in here right before dinner time as it was a tad bit cheaper, PLUS there were unlimited mimosas included (major YAY). . . Reasons why Bacchanal stands above the rest:. - SO much food and variety, you don't know where to go next. - Tons of options for meat- prime rib is a must, lots of sausages and other meats galore. - SEAFOOD, all I really did was go to town on the crabs and shrimp, my favorite was the crawfish though. That was a pleasant surprise.. . Just like other buffets they have a huge selection of each ethnic cuisine and they spend a lot of time and thought executing their selections. If you need to decide on which buffet you're going to splurge at, I highly recommend this one. This is where you want to agonize in pain after because of how full you are.
I am a big buffet eater and I have, I was so impress with the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace. My family and I went there for their weekend brunch and it was amazing. By far this is the best buffet I've been too. It is an upscale buffet and you get your money worth. Plenty of selections, servers are nice, its clean, awesome atmosphere, modern and most of all FOOD is so GOOD.
Never again. Chef brought strawberries and drop it on the floor. Picked it up and places it back on the display. Gross!!
Um, yes please! This is now mine and hubs' favorite buffet in Vegas. Really top notch stuff going on here. We made sure to get here early like around 5-6pm so that we could avoid the lines. They say there's a 2 hour limit, but they don't really check so if you get there early you can "stay as long as you want". . . Before I start to talk about their delicious food, I'd like to comment about the service. I saw that a few Yelpers complained about not getting enough attention - no one checked on them or refilled their water. Well, this was not the case for me. The busboy waited on us and was super attentive. It was great that he pitched in since we barely saw our actual waiter. I think our waiter was too busy with all the other tables he was in charge of. Water, tea, and drinks were a plenty for us and our plates were promptly cleared! . . The food. OH THE FOOD! . . Before I grabbed anything I walked around to see what kind of foods they offered. So much of everything. I was impressed with their Asian selection. It's not the best, but it's a few notches higher than what other buffets offer. Also, their cheese station!! DROOL~ So much seafood! . . To get my money's worth, I avoided the Asian, Italian, and Mexican stations! I only hit up the seafood, meat carving, and dessert. I did try some cheese though because I couldn't help it. I also got a scoop of veggies just to be healthy. . . Crab legs and oysters were fresh. They had some miso glazed seabass which I got several plates of. Really yummy! The lamb chops were really good too. Everything was high quality and well made like you could get at a fine restaurant. . . I would probably make a whole meal out of their desserts if I could. Everything I tried was tasty but not overdone. The pandan cake was my favorite. . . This is now a must when I come back to Vegas!. . Weekend dinner was $58.
As we were brought to our table we were told where everything was and I was excited about all the choices.. . First, I went to the seafood area and chose the shrimp, roasted red pepper bisque, and the miso glazed cod. The plump shrimp was the best of the 3 but with the shrimp being straight on the ice it tasted soft and semi water logged. The roasted red pepper bisque was flavorless and tasted more like a tomato soup. The miso glazed cod was cooked well but was luke warm and the wasabi mashed potatoes accompanying it were also luke warm which made the outer layer hard. Next, I went to the italian station and got the meatballs which were nicely presented and the penne carbonara. The meatball tasted fine but the tomato sauce was overly sweet and made the entire dish taste artificial. The carbonara tasted nothing like a carbonara, pasta was overcooked and it reminded me of the quality of pasta I would have tasted from a Souplantation. A few more low points were the sashimi being warm; pretzel rolls being dry; corn chowder crusty on top from it being luke warm; brisket more fat than meat. The one positive thing I will say is that this buffet has solid and well done desserts. I had the carrot cake; beignet; churro; strawberry cheesecake ice cream; mint chip ice cream; cheesecake pop; chocolate ganache log; oreo chocolate mousse. Carrot cake was moist and cream cheese frosting on top was nicely done. Beignet was also nicely done with it being freshly fried and warm. Churro was tasty but was more soft than crispy. Chocolate ganache log was my favorite; you could tell the chocolate was of high quality. . . Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality and execution of the food especially the hot items. The only reason I am even giving Baccchanal 2 stars is for the thoughtful/tasty dessert items.
Easily one of the best buffets in Vegas and one of the newest additions. I was waiting and waiting to go try this place and finally had the opportunity to do so, but of course it was done with a hangover.. so I want to try to give this place the best review I can under the circumstances that I was in. I tried a bit of everything even if it meant a few bites of one thing and a whole bowl of pho. Yes, pho.. and it was good too! Probably the best thing there that day, and it cured the hangover but I still didn't eat much of the other stuff. Everything was really high quality though and explains the price of the buffet. I would definitely like to go back and try it when I am "normal" again.
I was at the buchannal for lunch this Monday and the wife and I have a horrible case of food poisoning. The one dish we both share was the Pozole. If anyone else experienced this please post. What a horrible way to mess up Father's Day.
Wow. Looking for a good meal with luxury? Look no further. Fresh small family style servings in Le Creuset pots. Love their napkins, crab, fried pickles. I didn't like the Mexican food station. A tip: when it's busy ask to move your table towards the pool when there's an opening. Also, tip them at the door...
The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars is incredible! When I saw there was a two hour wait, I didn't get discouraged, I thought to myself this place must be phenomenal to have a price that high and a line that long. Let me tell you... worth every penny! Bacchanal is what happens when you give world class and classically trained Chefs millions of dollars and tell them to go for it. Best buffet in Vegas!! . I always do a walk through before plating up. At this price, I skip the easily ascertainable food (pasta, salads...etc) and go for the premium. The seafood was on point! Delicious crag legs, shrimp and the oysters were outstanding! Also, they had a BBQ station in the middle of this elegant and sophisticated restaurant. I've been smoking meats now for a few years back home and these smoked meats were tender, flavorful and succulent. The smoked brisket (ask for the point and not the flat) was mouth watering delicious. Everything there was top notch. This buffet could give fine dining a run for its money. And if you are a fine cheese person, you're in luck. The assortment of cheeses was quite impressive. The decor and the service were also excellent. I plan to visit Bacchanal many more times!
So this place opened since my last visit in 2011...and holy damn why wasn't it open earlier??? The Strip needed a place like this!. . Bacchanal has easily the biggest seafood options out of all the buffet restaurants in The Strip, ranging from oysters to mussels, clams, crab legs, crab claws, lobster bisque, etc. They also have various cuisines ranging from Italian to Indian to Chinese in the far corner, and also have great dessert displays that are only rivaled by the one at Wynn.. . Thing is, stuffing on seafood alone would already make your $50 charge worth, and quite honestly that was the true highlight of this buffet. Top scores also go to the prime rib, lamb racks, shrimp dumplings, siu mai, and most of the dessert options. What would make this place 5 stars, however, is an increased variety of fruits, and much less salt/oil in their soups as they were way too salty.. . Bacchanal is one of the busiest buffets on The Strip, so do expect a bit of a wait. There is a way around though: Pay $15 more and you can bypass the line completely. The other option is to be a party of between 4 and 8, as parties of 2 generally have a 30-45 minute wait during peak times.
The only Buffet worthy of 5 stars is the "Seafood Buffet" at Deer Valley in  Park City.  Bacchanal makes a solid effort but falls just a bit short when it comes to the high end shellfish.  The real star of any so called high end buffet.  Staff is a tad arrogant ... Maybe it's the hoards of mid-westerners in the "New Balance" running shoes.... Lot a sweat pants in the house as well.... Apparently you need to come prepared.. As you enter the 25,000 square foot feed lot you see the crux of all the excitement... The Crab Leg station.... 9 deep and 6 wide it's truly a spectacle of gluttony!  I'm thinking of a new reality tv show..... CRAB LEG WARS! VEGAS!!!! It's a literal frenzy ... All for an average snow crab leg that yields a thin flavorless reward .... Oyster Shooter are in tomato juice... Tip grab some extra cocktail sauce and reconstitute your own version (ala Brophy's).. Without droning on about this and that I'd say just go and experience it once it may be Heaven or it may be Hell.... You decide!?!?!?. . Secret super tip for normal people... Make it your first and only meal of the day at 2:30 pm.... Line will be shorter and price skyrockets at 3:00 pm.  They also won't rush you when you get inside.... We stayed for 3 hours!!!!!. And ask for Jo's station she's amazing and oh so pleasant!
They claim that this buffet won top awards for the past 2 years. Go anywhere but here unless you're willing to ruin the rest of your vacation. Besides being one of the most expensive buffets on the strip, don't be surprised if you become seriously ill for 2 months following this meal.. The management takes no responsibility for their improper treatment of the food they serve.. We witnessed the handling of raw food next to cooked food.. We were forced to spend the last 3 days of our vacation in our room, sick as dogs.. We are still sick, 2 months later, and our doctor now has us on massive dosages of Flagyl along with Cipro. These drugs are not easily tolerated and it should not be necessary to have to go through this.. If you had a similar experience please call (800) 696-6699 or their insurance campany @ (866) 446-1424. They are wise guys!!!!!! We would avoid this buffet at any cost.
This is an amazing buffet.  The stations are fully staffed and constantly replenished.  There is not a long wait inside for the higher-end foods.  There were about 6 or 7 different styles of food from Latin based, Asian and southern.  The brisk was outstanding and any choice on non-alcoholic drinks from fruit juice to Arnold Palmer included.  The desert options ranged from small pieces of delightful pies to handmade ice cream.  We ate for the entire 2 hour limit that we were there.     . . I am one that will 9/10 times say no I will not go to a buffet.  I do not like little hands touching near my food.  This buffet is setup where a lot of things to grab are individual.  . . If you are a diamond rewards member from Total Rewards, it is the best way to go.  There is no wait in line and you get great seating and service.  . . Can't wait to go next time!
There is soooooooo much to choose from, I was full just LOOKING at what they had to offer!. . First things first, there's a huuuge line / wait! When I went, they gave us a ticket & told us to return in an hour ... so we had to kill time by gambling. I suggest to go earlier than when you plan on eating so that you don't have to wait for too long.. . But wow, there was a great selection of desserts including ice cream, crepe station, cakes, cake pops, cupcakes, etc etc. the list can just go on forever! They also had taco station, soups, salads, and even guava juice!!! Oh! And the waiter even brought me over this peach green tea .... AMAZING! I kept ordering this over & over again.. . I would have to say that they get really busy so you might not get as much attention from the servers as you want, but just be patient!. . Aside from that, I was full within 2-3 plates but I kept forcing myself to eat more because they had soooo much selection! My favorite was the shrimp cocktail, king crab legs, and all the stations that they had. crepes were good but a little bit too sweet for my taste and also cause they don't use fresh strawberries. they used the can kind :(. . We went for dinner on a Monday, which was $55 a person! Pretty pricey, so you better pace yourself before you get too full too fast!
Vegas is known for their awesome buffets and Bacchanal is one of the newest and is definitely one of the best. So much choices, so much food....KING CRAB LEGS FOR DAYS!!!
So. much. yum.. . First, I thought this was very reasonably priced for the breakfast buffet.  I think it came out to $25 each.  And we ate SO MUCH.  #fatties. . The place is so big that I actually got lost at first and couldn't find the way back to our table.  There's so many different sections.  I actually got a little annoyed with my friend for taking the first things she saw.  Does she not know how to work a buffet?  You have to scan the whole place first to make sure you can fit all the good stuff in your stomach.  And there's a lot of good stuff.  So skip the typical items.  Go for the Thai dishes, the impeccable sweets, the fro-yo/ice cream, etc.  I can't imagine what they have for the dinner buffet!. . Every station was kept well stocked and the employees were hard at work.  Servers were friendly as well.
What are you looking for? A beautiful glasshouse filled with gorgeous furniture and  lounge music? Well, that's exactly what you're going to find.. . Setting: The setting, atmosphere and service definitely is one of the best I've ever encountered. . . Seafood: You can expect to see a glass cube of crab legs cut half open, or an ice mountain of raw oysters. Sounds exciting, right? That quite sums up what is to expect in terms of their seafood. . . Desserts: This restaurant offers much more in terms of desserts including but not limited to gelatos, crepes (and creeps) and deliciously, rich chocolate strawberries. . . Aside from service, Bacchanal buffet offers many, many good things to customers except for anything great. You want lobsters? You're not going to find it here. If you think you have an insatiable appetite, I think this might just turn your world upside down.
Let me do you a favor and save you any argument on your next venture to the Strip of what the best buffet in Vegas is. It's here.. . Yes, for breakfast it is a little pricier than the Rio or pretty much the other options. But it is 1000% worth it. They have everything here. You've got the American breakfast basics...and the Mexican breakfast basics...and the low-carb basics. There's Asian fare (including donuts I haven't had since in China). There's an entire section of charcuterie and cheese (it's phenomenal cheese). They have pressed juice. They have mini everything. They have sugar free and sugar OD desserts. There's a ton of places to sit. It's divine.. . When my boyfriend and I went, we went about 30-45 minutes before they switched to lunch. So, we got to try the breakfast AND the lunch options. I would have eaten more (there were these awesome looking sliders and soups) but while the mind was willing, the body was not strong enough.. . I feel this will be my only buffet in Vegas from here on out. My only regret of coming here is not having a big enough stomach to cram in everything I want to consume.
I may be the only person on Earth to think this, but crab legs are overrated. Seriously, everyone I ever see at a buffet piles plates high with these things, and it just takes up space and uses a ton of energy for such a small payoff. Call me crazy! . . But if you are like every other buffet attendee, there are plenty of crab legs for you to hoard, along with other popular buffet fare like prime rib, sushi, and creme  brulee. They also have some more original offerings, but to be honest after spending more than an hour there I couldn't really remember anything I had eaten. I think that's why I'm not a huge buffet person to begin with! . . The ambiance is luxurious, conducive to large groups, and the waiters are very attentive about drinks and cleaning up your dirty dishes. There are several spread out stations including Asian, Italian, meats of all kinds, and of course the precious seafood. Funny enough, one of the favorites of my group was the pho broth. Who knew?? I think the desserts were really underwhelming and next time I'd just stick with a little gelato and call it a day.. . If you love going to buffets and stuffing your face, you'll definitely enjoy Bacchanal. But if you're anything like me you might want to consider if you'd rather spend that $60 on a delicious regular meal or maybe at the slots!
The expectation coming into this buffet was 1) good quality food and 2) endless quantities of it.. . My results?. 1) NOPE. Only the miso sea bass was worth having beyond a second serving of. . 2) SURE. I was able to indulge in more mediocre food after regurgitating it into the porcelain toilet conveniently located outside of the eating area. . . Now I'moff to figure out how to get the most out of my money while I'm still here...
Hands down best buffet in Las Vegas and best on the buffet of buffets.  Worth the up charge.
On my third trip to Vegas, I went with my Partner In Dining. He's the one who chose this spot to eat. . . Everyone always raves about Wicked Spoon. Well, move over because the Bacchanal just took the wicked out of your spoon.. . The best time to go is 30 minutes before lunch ends. That way, you get the lunch price and still get the dinner food. That's what I learned on my trip following this one.. . The first thing that caught my eye was all the fresh juices! Guava, watermelon, mango, tamarind, horchata, orange, and jamaica. WOW did that keep me hydrated. But, be careful because they you'll get full.. . The Bacchanal has the following sections:. Seafood: Oysters, crabs, shrimps, clams, and some other hot food items. BBQ Meats with all the Southern side fixin's. Tacos, made to order with every kind of salsa you could imaging. Cold Meats & Cheeses + honey comb. Italian pasta/pizza. (if you want your crab legs boiled, they can do it here just ask!). Salads. Asian/Noodles/Sushi/Dim Sum. Desserts/Ice Cream/Sorbet. . Seriously, pace yourself so you can eat everything.. . Lunch is around $35 a person, and dinner is closer to $55.. . Definitely worth it to eat here after a night out on the strip and your alcohol soaked liver is crying for help.. . It's well air conditioned so bring a light sweater/jacket so you can eat comfortably.. . Until next time, don't forget your ID!
they have an amazing presentation on their desert. It looks very pretty and delicious. I love the "Mountain Macaroon" Crisp and not too sweet . Lamb for me a little bit sweet, love the concept of Alaska Crab leg cut in half, so much to eat.
I give it 3 stars cause they tried. Nothing was any better than most of the buffets in town. Yes its all nice and pretty. But come on. For $120 for 2 people you should get more. The cracked crab legs were very small. Only tiny slivers of meat. Not worth it. Seems like you get more doing it yourself. And for everyone to rave about the brisket. You must not be from texas. It tasted like a roast. Im not trying to talk any of you out of eating here. Somethings were real good. Like the scallopped potatoes. Not $60.00 good. But good. Just go in thinking its just going to be ok. That away you wont feel disappointed.
(WEEKDAY DINNER REVIEW ONLY) I am sorry but half of the photos on yelp are now false..they've brought the buffet way below the expectations that I had looking at all the photos, but be wary. I came on a weekday. Monday, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN THE BELOW QUALITY EXPECTATIONS.. . 1. Desserts- Only about 2-4 plates of each type of cake and their was no such cheesecake, which from the reviews was amazing but sadly their was none :( and tried a carrot cake..guess it was old or something it tasted so dry..I mean..wow. I'm sorry for being fussy Guys xD..but I was really looking forward for "A BUFFET WORTHY OF THE GODS (the motto)". 2. The way foods were served in mini baskets, mini pots, mini bowls. Nope. After review and review about the grand opening month with cute signature miniature bowls/pots/baskets, which I came to look forward to :3. But. Those fried chicken baskets? Those cute sweet potato tots in baskets? Nope. First of all their was not a single fried chicken ( I didn't mind anyway but just pointing out for those) and no such thing as tater tots in a cute basket..same with the ginseng chicken soup. No pots as pointed out in photos... 3. (Subjective) I'm not very fond of the taco station, dry meat. 4. Fresh fruit juices, trust me guys this was really fresh before and now it's not... Overall in was way below these expectations I had but it's my fault for reading all the good reviews xD..haha..sorry for being fussy again! But where their is cons their is pros :3. PROS- . 1. OMG. Divine sweet crab legs oh my dear lords as in most and nearly ever buffet in Vegas when you usually steam boil the crab legs they turn all..ugh and bland.. But these were deliciously sweet even after being boiled in hot water which I love them steamed and to those who don't know how, bring a plate to the Italian section and their is like these huge colorful pots, just put a plate on the counter and they'll give you bunch of cut up crab legs now people might think it's a con for it to be split, but at bacchanal I don't know how they do this but it doesn't taste dry up at all so don't worry..but I can speak for every day here... OVERALL..Guys I totally think this place would of been better if I went on a weekend so..I'll see c:
I have been here 4 times now and do have to say, I would have given this place a 5 but after I have watch the quality start to go down  and the prices go up as well, there is no way I would come back here again and my friends follow and trust me being known as (again) the buffet queen. Especially big casino's like this that pulls in so much revenue, they had started something great. Keep it up! But when prices go up and quality goes down, I see greed. I eat A LOT and I mean A LOT and I am very observant. So any changes, I would usually notice. The lines used to be much longer but not anymore, doesn't that tell you something? Obviously, I'm not the only one who notice it. Here are a few things in a flash:. . -   Before they had choices of snow crabs and king crabs with pretty equal amounts of both. Now they mix it up where there is 80% snow and 20% king as some people would not notice the difference and just grab anything.. . -   They still have the ginseng chicken soup which is delicious and used to come in individual small pots. Not there is a big pot for you to scoop in a big bowl yourself.. . -   A lot of their soups are SO SALTY i can't even swallow it and had to spit it out.. . -  They used to give you actual towel hand wipes which they now save and no longer give them out but this one isn't a big deal as I'm rating on food not napkins.. . -  They used to have better sushi choices and even caviar which they no longer serve unless I went on a day they just didn't have it.. . -  They used to serve fresh squeezed OJ in tiny jars which they don't anymore but they do however have aqua fresca's instead. . . All in all. I will give credit that they do use higher quality food and ingredients such as truffle in some of their cooking etc. and the only thing I DO have to still give them credit on is the desserts. For all you who love desserts, I LOVE the dessert selections here!!! I would eat a whole plate of dessert alone!! But is it worth spending almost $50/pp here, maybe not but in rare occasion its still ok.
I went here during a Thursday night for dinner and was quite frustrated with the waiting time. But I was patient and boy do I not regret it. Food was absolutely delicious. It was the best buffet I have ever been. The variety was infinite and the food was cooked as if grandma was in the back making it from one of her secret recipes. This buffet clearly has its ducks in a row when it comes to chowing down. This isn't your standard prison food buffet. This is definitely a full force working kitchen with actual chefs. Food never is sparse and you can eat all you want. Oh and the best part? They have gourmet cheese for you to nibble on. Delicious!!!
Hands down the best buffet in Vegas.  I have been to Wynn, Bellagio, Aria and Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan.  They don't compare.  Bacchanal has oysters, crab, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, lamb, italian, american, you name it.  The wait can be long, but they have kiosks where you can grab a ticket and come back at the time on the ticket.  In my opinion it is well worth the extra $ and time.  If you aren't a big fan of asian food or sea food, you might not get your money's worth, but the meat selection is incredible.  I have gone on a week day and on the weekend.  Both meals were excellent.
I waited in line for 3 hrs and all I thought was "really, that's the best you can do, caesar's?" Other than the fancy decor, the pretty plating, and the cute juice bottles, I was bored. The food was normal, the selection was bare, and the price is ridiculously expensive! Definitely a "one time, did that" kind of place. I really felt like I was paying for the atmosphere than the food, and for $50+, I'd rather not. I found myself get up only twice for more food. Meh.
It's pretty good. Tons of food choices and there wasn't a line for us. Loved the sugar free cheesecake. Definitely worthy!!
For the price meh. They do have a huge selection of things but seems like a buffet is a buffet. Nothing is great -just lots. Most people are into lots so if that were the case then this is wonderful. I don't eat tons of food in one sitting, so I guess I am looking for that one item that'd wow me. Which is hard to find at a buffet since the food is sitting there under a warmer. I like buffets since I can have a smidgen of everything but if it's this pricey then I want at least one wow.
Tonight I want all of you tonight. Give me everything tonight. For all we know we might not get tomorrow. Let's do it tonight at...BACCHANAL BUFFET! - Pitbull (give me everything). . It's been a long time coming but I finally got to try this place! I'm not a big fan of waiting in line for buffets and Bacchanal (part of Caesars entertainment group) is the only buffet in Vegas that I can't get a front of the line pass for (we had a falling out on my part about four years ago lol) The day finally arrived andit was already confusing lining up here. You take a ticket and you can come back when they text you, but the line that you come back to looks like the same line that you would wait in line for even if you didn't take a ticket? Sigh I was so confused LOL. . Foods that I was looking forward to:. 1. prime rib - it was alright but couldn't find horse radish sauce and also was the only meat at the carving station that I was interested in. 2. sweet potato tater tots - oh oh oh haha the only buffet that I know of that has these tasty treats. 3. warm crab legs - they serve it to you and will give you as much as you want, we had a lot of these!. 4. dessert - the cake selection was a little disappointing and the macarons were really too sweet. . Foods that I hoped to like but didn't:. 1. taco bar - cool concept with a chef making it in front of you but the meats were salty. 2. fried rice - so sad if you mess this up, thus i was so sad. 3. dim sum - they do not have an asian chef back there, I'm convinced!. . Foods that surprised me:. 1. fresh juices - I wanted fresh watermelon juice but it wasn't in season; there were like 6 to choose from and I tried like 3 of them and all good, including mango and strawberry. 2. ramen and udon - you feel almost silly to fill up on noodles at a buffet but these had great texture. 3. congee - add in the egg and it was flavorful. . I think this is a buffet that's still worth trying if you've never been here before. The food selection is diverse (I think I expected more) although you would probably only go back for seconds for a select few. I was disappointed that dessert wasn't up to par with Wicked Spoon or the Wynn. Even if the ladies are disappointed with any buffet, at least they'll leave happy if the dessert is yummy...
Bacchanal, I wanted to love you - I really did. You were actually one of the places I was most looking forward to when visiting Vegas for the first time in my adult life after all the publicity you've been getting. However, I was a bit disappointed unfortunately.. . Don't get my wrong, the food was good. I actually quite liked their macarons. However what was offered overall, just didn't seem very exceptional. When I think about the cost of admittance, I felt like I could have gotten better elsewhere. . . I just couldn't justify spending over $50, on overly salty food. . . But with that said, the next time I'm in the area, I'm willing to give you another try. Perhaps brunch? Bottomless mimosas!
I really don't know what the hype is been here 3xs and each time it's just reg buffet food nothing special. Maybe the glass cup decor but it's just a reg buffet with nothing that stands out
Pros: . . - Good food. - good selection. - comfortable chairs. . Cons:. . - inefficient staff causes long line to get in. - spotty table service. - carpet not well cleaned/maintained. - "Express pass" is a joke and waste of money. . Bottom line: good food, but not worth the long wait in line.. . My girlfriend and I make it a habit to try one high-end buffet every time we come to Vegas. We had heard and read good things about Bachhanal, so decided to try it. We went on a Sunday night about 7:30, figuring the line wouldn't be so bad. Wrong!!!! We got there only to see a long-ass line that reminded us of a popular nightclub. There is a little machine where you check in and it gave us a ticket that told us to return in 77 minutes to be seated. Or, you could pay $20 apiece to skip the line. We decided to do this, but I was pissed with the result as we did NOT get to skip the line- instead they just place you in another line with people who came back after waiting their 77 minutes. What a ripoff. The dinner price was $53 apiece (before the $20 express charge).. . Anyway, after 30 minutes of waiting in the express line, we were finally seated. I was appalled at what we saw- open table after open table. Several were not cleaned yet which told me their bussing service is lacking. It also was very clear that they either don't care about people in line or are purposely making them wait there as nightclubs do very often- to make it look like a "hot" place that everyone has to eat at. Either way, it's disgusting.. . There was a great selection of food- seafood, Chinese, sushi, American, Italian, and a small salad bar. They also had a huge dessert bar with an excellent selection. We especially liked their sea bass (with wasabi mashed potatoes and Bok choi), the sweet potato tater tots, Asian green beans, king crab legs, shrimp dumplings, and custard dumplings. . . Our server was ok, but would sometimes disappear for lengths of time. Plates were cleared quickly, however. My girlfriend noticed food on the carpet in several areas. Disappointing given the stature of the place and the fact it wasn't even full ( don't get me going on THAT again). . . Overall, we liked the food, but were disappointed with other aspects of our experience. We think the buffets at the Wynn and Cosmopolitan were better and were about the same price. We would come back to Bacchanal, but only if there were no line (or a very small one).
Bacchanalia, a festival of merriment and libations, a riotous tribute to Bacchus, the god of wine and ecstasy. Intoxicated revelry, drunken orgies...the Romans had it good.. . Contemporary visitors to Caesar's Palace aren't so lucky. They must queue up before indulging at the Bacchanal Buffet by checking in at the self-service kiosks. A piece of parchment with a wait time will be dispensed. . . At 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday, our wait was CLVI minutes. That's fancy for 156 minutes, which is, in other words, 2 hours and 36 minutes. Within an hour and a half, however, they delivered a message that our turn was up, at which point we were allowed 15 minutes to come claim our spot.. . The price for dinner was LVIII dollars and some change. You're better off not deciphering that. For those who put in the effort to understand it, you'll probably want to know, was it worth it?. . If you just want to load up on typical buffet foods like crab legs and prime rib, you can be satisfied somewhere else and pay less. The draw of Bacchanal is their dishes, prepared with the attention you may find at a fine-dining restaurant.. . Many of their selections come tapas-style, on a tiny plate or miniature pan that you take with you to your table. They even provide silicon finger tabs so you don't burn yourself as you grab. The seabass on wasabi mashed potatoes was outstanding as well as the shrimp on grits. . . As for seafood, crab legs were available hot or cold and cross-sectioned for easy extraction. Raw oysters were offered but only half-shucked, and they weren't that meaty. . . Dessert items were hit or miss, but the chocolate-filled beignets were exceptional, and the chocolate macarons were on par with the ones from a nice bakery.. . Although the price and wait time may make the gods gasp in dismay and tumble out of Mt. Olympus, the quality preparations would satisfy the pickiest of the pantheon. The god of wine continues to inspire cult-ish gatherings, this time in the name of refined gluttony.
The brisket is sublime. Head and shoulders above any buffet. Fresh, hot, and flavorful with lots of variety.
We paid a $20 premium per person to skip the fucking line and are still waiting after an hour in line.  Don't give a fuck how good food is not coming back
Service was good, but they closed off the food 30 minutes+ before they were scheduled to close at 11:00 (closed off the food at 10:20-10:30). The service was great though, but kinda bummed about how quickly they closed.... Food variety was okay for what we paid,  $110 for 2 people plus tip.
***This place doesn't deserve ANY star, but I'll put one on in order to complete the review***. . This place is effen bullshit!!! They would schedule a reservation one minute before they close. We arrive there on time and they announce they cannot serve us. Their excuse is that it's a computer glitch and they are sorry they can't serve us. Since when do computer glitches make it the customers' fault? NOT OUR PROBLEM!!  Us customers schedule our time before and around the reservation. What is sad is that they can only comp for the next day.  How's about giving us a comp for 20 mins or our next Vegas visit?  Also adding insult to injury, we came at 9:59pm and Yelp says they close at 11:00pm!! WTF is that???. . The food is maybe "labeled" the best buffet in Vegas but definitely the WORST customer service!!  All they can say is SORRY SORRY SORRY.  Call me a WAAAH-MBULANCE!  Sorry is never the customers fault!. . What a way to ruin the tail end of a Vegas vacation.
One of the best buffet places I have been to, and I've been to a few in Vegas. One word of advice though -- come here during the week as during the weekends they jack up their prices for "Champagne brunch". You're forced to pay 20 dollars more whether you want to or not. . . However, with that being said, the food here was so bomb and there were so many different selections. My friends and I came here at 12 pm and literally stayed until 5 pm, slowly making our way through each course. Anything that you wanted, this place had, from king crab legs and crab hollandaise to sushi and pizza. There was a big island of desserts in the center of the restaurant which made for a perfect way to end the meal. . . Even though it was a buffet, you definitely got the feel that you were at an upscale restaurant as the decor is beautiful and the service was great. I got my money's worth by filling up on those bottomless mimosas! . . Definitely a must try on your next trip to Vegas.
The decor and ambiance is upscale however overall the buffet was mediocre. . . The selection is mostly carbs. I went on Sunday for brunch. At $50 per person after tax, this buffet was not worth it for those who don't drink. One perk that I did like is that the king crab legs were cut in half. . . I had high expectations based off the numerous reviews and 4 star rating. No point in getting a Total Rewards card, you'll save a whopping $1.
I went here expecting it to be amazing. It was just ok. Here we go..  the guy who was working the carving station was rude as hell. Big black dude named Thomas (I think ). There was only one customer (me) at the carving station and I just stood there as looked over at me but ignored me. Didn't even say "hello" or "I'll be right with you." Left me to wonder whether that was the actual carving station or just a display window and the carving station was located elseware. I asked him, "Is this the carving station and he said, "Yeah." I said, "ok can I get something?" He said, :"uh huh."  I felt like I was inconveniencing him. Our table was just a few feet away from the carving station and he called people out who were in line with a very loud, shrill "M'aam" or "Sir". And kept saying it until they acknowledged him. Hmm seems like he wants to be acknowledged but he doesn't reciprocate. Would never allow someone like that to be client facing. . . Now the food:. Fried duck - amazing. Better than what I've ordered in fine restaurants when the duck is the entry. This was crispy, juicy and not overly fatty. . BBQ pork (chinese style) - superb. Not dried out and very flavorful with a slight sweetness. . Prime rib and lamb chops. Wonderful, except they were served at the carverie by Mr WonderNOT. . . Our servers Esteban and a very sweet girl whose name I can't remember. They worked well as a team and made us feel very much at home. . . The restaurant was rather chaotic. It was about 5pm on Sunday night. I've been here for brunch and we came early in the morning and it was outstanding.
I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. . . Based on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.
There's no their defined "ticket rules" in any forms of instruction. So by the time we have waited for 30 minutes to get into the buffet. The lady in the front desk just said "oh , u need to press the machine for ticket and get into the line AGAIN" . Maybe it's just the "Excellent service" they can provide.........
Really good. Most amazing buffet I've ever had. Not quite 5 stars because during seating and serving the staff seemed confused about who to seat next and what line was for which people. Overall though it's definitely worth checking out. Like after you haven't eaten for 3 days. Tacos, thai, italian, meat cheese and fruit, bbq, seafood, this mushroom soup was knocked off the chart though. Gotta try it.
Bacchanal is, hands down, one of the best of the best when it comes to Vegas buffets.  Every time I've eaten here, I've left with an incredibly overstuffed and happy tummy.  You know that saying, quality over quantity?  Well, why not quality AND quantity!  Bacchanal has them both!. . They have all types of foods.... Starting from the front of the buffet. Seafood: crab, oyster, prawns, mussels, clams, fish. Carving station: prime rib, all kinds of sausages, different cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, pork. American: BBQ style foods, corn, mashed potato, hamburgers, mini hot dogs, sweet potato tater tots, scalloped potatoes, etc.. Mexican: (I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I don't quite remember what was here but there was a huge selection of dishes!) . Bread bar: tons of breads, multigrain, buns, corn bread, soft bread...but why waste precious stomach space on bread?. Juice bar: adorable glass bottles filled with strawberry juice, hibiscus juice, horchata, mango juice, guava juice (I really wanted to take these cute bottles home, but you're not allowed to.  So sad). Italian: pizzas, meatballs, pastas, etc. my favorite was the cheese, dried fruit, and cured meats station!. Salad bar: again, why waste precious stomach space on salad?. Asian: sushi, rolls, build your own ramen, build your own udon, building your own pho, dim sum and dumplings, sticky rice, Chinese dishes, etc.. . Don't forget to go around the corner because there is another section that you don't want to miss out on.. . And last but definitely not least....my favorite......drumroll...... THE DESSERT STATION!!. So many cakes, pies, chocolate covered strawberries, homemade marshmallows, cake pops, pastries, cookies, brules, tarts, cream puffs, a whole freezer of ice cream flavors, build your own crepe, build your own ice cream sandwich, Bubbies mochi ice cream (yes, correctly!  They fly over Hawaii's own Bubbies mochi ice cream!!). Tip: when getting dessert, first go to the regular food area to pick up a plate because those are bigger than the plates at the dessert station.  That way, you can get more dessert every time you go up!. . All in all, I ended up eating 9 plates and drinking three juice bottles (2x Asian food, 2x Italian food, 2x meats and other random dishes, 1x American food, 2x dessert).  I think I stretched out my tummy to a whole new level after eating here but once I started eating, I just couldn't stop!  You can really do some damage here since everything tastes so good.  Come hungry and leave happy!   Incredibly, wonderfully happy.
The food we had at Bacchanal buffet (Caesars Palace) was truly and completely worth every penny. The bacchanal buffet is voted as the best buffet in Las Vegas. They offer......hold your breath.... more than 500 dishes to choose from. We were in a foodies wonderland. I remember having tasted almost everything. They also had an impressive spread of desserts. With so much to choose from, you will definitely leave the place happy and satisfied.
Probably one of the more expensive brunch buffets in Vegas at $45 a pop, but the quality was overall on point.  I would recommend to not come in a big group of ten like I did or you will have to endure a two hour wait..... They do have an option to skip the wait time if you pay $20. Yea we weren't willing to wait that long so F IT!!! :)  . . The sushi selection is very lacking to only salmon and tuna so I was a bit disappointed in that since that's usually where I head to first when I hit any buffet.  I do give them points though on their dim sum selection which actually wasn't that bad.  It wasn't as bad as other buffets that serve packaged frozen crap.  Siu mai and ha gow were not that bad at all. Cha siu was bombskis tho.. . I probably devoured two plates of snow crab legs, about half were on the salty side and the other half on the sweeter side.  Yea I know it's not great for cholesterol but I never really get a chance to eat it that often, so no bigs!  The shrimp were ok, they did have a slight smell to them but not totally offputting.  Our group stayed for a while past the brunch hour which was rolling into the dinner time so they were putting oysters out on the half shell as well!  I could only eat about 3 since I was so full by then but from what I could remember, they were decent as well.  Not the best but none of them made me sick.. . I tend to stick with the proteins and stay away from all the starchy carbs so I can't comment on any of the pasta/rice dishes.  The prime rib was cooked well but the quality was no more than select.  The wait for the carne asada isn't really worth it either. It was good but not ten minutes in line good.  . . I think the desserts were somewhat of the redeeming factor of the meal since as I said before, we stayed during the transition from brunch to dinner.  So macarons and chocolate dipped strawberries were on the menu as well as the breakfast type dessert pastries as well.. . Our waitress Patty was outstanding and made the experience much more enjoyable.  She was constantly around refillling our mimosas and stayed around to chat with us from time to time and crack jokes.. . I would put Bacchanal on level with Bellagio and the Wynn buffets so definitely worth a stop before leaving Vegas.
After hearing this was the BEST buffet I decided to take the time to check it out. They have the new ticketing wait system which worked out well. The wait was only an hour for lunch on a Monday we put our name down then went and had a drink at the bar a few feet away and the wait went by fast. The lines to get food were very long it kind of sucked but what do ya expect. . .   The food was good I loved that they had oysters I don't remember Wicked Spoon offering oysters ever at lunch time. Overall though Wicked Spoon was a much better buffet. Wicked spoon has a much bigger selection of everything and also offers unlimited drinks for a price which Bacchanal does not. The food selection was ok nothing special. The crab legs and Sangria were quite tasty though I will say. Service was also very slow.. If you're deciding between this and Wicked Spoon.. go to Wicked Spoon!
My friends and I purposely didn't eat all day in order to arrive at Bacchanal hungry. We got in line only to get told that they were at capacity and to come back in an hour. Tummies grumbling, we wandered Caesar's Palace in search of alcohol. Because 1) why not and 2) Vegas. We hopped back in line tipsy and starving at 9:30, paid, and waited to be seated. By 9:50 we're finally being led to our table when our hostess says, "By the way, all the food gets taken back to the kitchen at 10:30." Most people would be annoyed about this, but my friends and I looked at each other with expressions that screamed CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.. . It was a mad dash from there. We attacked the buffet from all sides, bringing back 3-4 plates at a time and trying not to stumble due to our otherwise empty stomachs filled only with alcoholic slushie. Our table was straight up insanity. Plates on plates on plates. "Ooh what's that? That looks good! Can I try some?" Forks and spoons with morsels and tidbits of food were flying left and right. Who knows if we even ended up with our own silverware. Bacchanal staff did a great job clearing plates and keeping our waters topped off. They saw how quickly we were eating and kept up. I seriously felt like a 6-stomached cow shoveling food into my pie hole as fast as The Flash.. . Eventually we slowed down, leaned back in our chairs, and put our forks down. Checked the time: 10:10. My friends and I sped-ate through Bacchanal in 20 minutes!  It was probably disgusting and disturbing to watch but yes I'm proud. Bacchanal is huge. If you want it, they have it. Filet mignon, king crab, a noodle station, gelato, and creme brulee. Crawdads, sushi, lamb chops, macarons. Cookies, cake, brownies, risotto, brisket, truffle potatoes, soup, paella, and charcuterie. It's a Beauty and the Beast-sized smorgasbord, the only thing is the dishes don't dance.. . So maybe we didn't get to savor the flavors of what we were eating, but Bacchanal provided a super fun buffet experience I won't forget. Great selection, beautiful layout, and a roaming photographer! I suggest you take a bite of everything they have and don't worry about the waste (no extra charge). Ah, Vegas. Land of excess. Burp.
Having read the raving reviews and having seen the consistent 4 stars i was really excited to try this place. Unfortunately I found the service to be sub par and the workers unfriendly. The food was mostly too salty. The only plus side is the oysters. Overall I felt like I paid way more than I got from this buffet. . . There's other buffets that are cheaper and in my opinion have better tasting food.
Not worth it anymore.  No tomahawk ribeye.  Raised prices.. Got a rude host and meat carver one time.. . And the meat was terrible one out of the 3 visits.  Really dry prime rib.. . Tacos were really good one visit.  And just okay the second visit.
In my opinion, if there is only one buffet you gonna try in Vegas, this is it.  selections and quality are excellent.  . . Frankly, I am surprised by how comfortable the environment is here.  People seem to hang out for a long time.. . One draw back is that the wait can be Disney long.  We went in a Monday afternoon at 3pm.  The wait was at least 30 min.  Cannot imagine what the line would be like at prime meal time or on weekends.. . The lining system is interesting.  You use a kiosk to put your cell number and get a ticket that shows your wait time.  You will be texted when it is close to your turn.  Then you will stay in line, pay the cashier and be seated.. . Since the wait can be long, go to the kiosk and grab a ticket early is important.
one of the best buffets I've had! . . My friends and I come to have lunch before we hit up edc,  and the line was super long. They had a touch screen monitor in the middle of the line where you can reserve a spot for your party which was super convenient. It prints you out a receipt telling you how long your wait shall be and when to come check in at the front desk. Our wait time was an hour so we had time to gamble and walk around Caesars. . . An hour has passed and we come back and it's already dinner time and prices but luckily we got to pay lunch price and still eat the dinner food! So happy they were able to accommodate that for us, or we got lucky :) lunch price was 38 bucks and dinner I believe is near 60?. . They had a HUGE selection of food. This is my second time here and I still get lost! Lol I'm a huge sushi fan so I went straight to the Asian food area and grabbed 10 piecesof salmon and tuna nigiri and half a roll. I think I made my money worth in that one plate already lol try their salmon! It's in the seafood area. So yummy. There are some dishes that aren't the best, but there are some where you keep coming back for more. You feel like you're in heaven when you're getting dessert. Chocolate covered strawberries, mochi, macarons, cheesecake etc etc. Ahh! I miss this place. . . Service isn't too bad either. Clearing up your empty or unwanted dishes and refilling your drinks. Come try this place out!
Can't express how amazing this dinner buffet was!  Spending the same amount at another restaurant would only get you 1 dish & a glass of wine.  Here it's all gourmet, & as much as you want of whatever you want!  Awesome cheese, great crab legs freshly steamed, beautiful & delicious desserts!
In terms of a buffet, this is by far the best in quality and selection. It's located inside of Caesar's near their casino. We went on the Friday of a busy weekend at 11:30am and waited around 30 mins. We had an extremely large party (16 people) but they were quick to accommodate us.. . Upon being escorted to our table, I quickly went to scour the variety of options they offered. Dim sum, Chinese, Mongolian bbq, salads, assorted fruit, fresh Mexican grill/tacos, American comfort (mini red velvet pancakes, wagyu beef sliders, mac n' cheese, scallop potatoes, sweet potato tots, cheesy broccoli, brussel sprouts), pasta, sushi (rolls, salmon and tuna nigiri), ramen bar, cheese platters, pizza, prime rib, brisket, assorted sausages, turkey and a seafood bar (crab legs, oysters, clams, grilled salmon, and cocktail shrimp).. . Like with any buffet, I skipped the Chinese and salad section and headed straight towards the meat and carbs.. . I was able to grab the last of their breakfast food, mini red velvet pancakes, to start off. Sadly, this looked better than it tasted :( It was a tad dry and lacked flavor. . . Their truffle mac n' cheese was really good at first but quickly got too heavy for me. . . The meats are worth salivating over but I preferred the brisket over the prime rib because of the fatty flavor. The sausages were also tasty!. . My boyfriend tried the dimsum and was surprisingly impressed. The sushi was bland and not worth getting.. . We thought the seafood bar was delicious! The stars were the huge pieces of shrimp with sauce and the oysters. . . Closing with their amazing dessert selection, we tried a little bit of everything: green tea creme brulee, green tea cookie with red bean filling, green tea tiramisu, flan, cookie pops, and ice creammm!! The desserts were pretty good, just wish we were able to try a few more items . . Overall, we loved everything and had a great experience. Lunch was around $33 but after gratuity, we paid $45. This buffet is worth it and would recommend if you're in Vegas.
Location: Caesars Palace. . Tip: You have to check in at the Kiosk! Don't just stand at the end of the line. . . Also, don't be fooled by the ridiculous "estimated" wait time. I checked in at the kiosk at 3:30 pm and on the receipt it said: "estimated seating: 7:45 pm". I was in disbelief because all the yelp reviews I read said at most the wait time would be two hours and thirty minutes. I double checked with the tall asian manager with glasses and asked him several times about the wait time. I asked, "Is this a good estimate? The line is pretty short, and we don't have time to wait for four hours." He assured me the estimated time was pretty accurate so I should def consider paying the $20 express line option. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and paid the extra $20 for a grand total of $76!. . I got a text notification about one hour and twenty minutes later letting me know that I was at the front of the line and I would need to come back to pay (if I hadn't already) . Basically I got hustled... Four hour wait my butt, I only had to wait an hour, no need to go to the express line! Shout out to the Asian manager with the spiky hair for hustling me! . . Food: Enormous selection of food! You start with Chinese food at the back of the line. Everything was excellent save for the shrimp "dumplings". If you're the type that looks for good asian food at a buffet, Bacchanal is perfect for you! They had the leanest pork belly I've ever had in my entire life. The shrimp shumai was also very good. The fried rice was also very tasty. . . There wasn't really a "Nice" selection of Japanese food. The California roll they made was very good though. . . NOODLE OPTION: FINALLY a buffet that offers UDON Noodle soup, PHO, AND RAMEN! I have never seen that before and I've always wondered how old I would have to be for someone to make a smart business move like that. Bravo Bacchanal. . . Italian option: Looked appetizing, but didn't have the patience to wait for that section of the line! . . Meat option: If it's bulking season for you, this is the buffet to be at. The BEST prime rib I've ever had in my entire life. No joke. The lamb was also amazing. They offer BBQ ribs, turkey, and a huge freaking bone with a chunk of meat.. (Not sure what type of meat it was, but let's say it was a buffalos leg. Jk.). . Soup selection: My wifey tried all of the soup selections and she loved every single one!. . Juice: don't skip over the juice! They had a little section with glass juices and they tasted wonderful. I loved the pineapple ;) and mango option! Make sure you don't fill up your stomach with juices though.. (Another smart business idea). . Carne asada tacos at Bacchanal over King Taco. I'm not even kidding.. . Fish: I can't remember every fish I tried off the top of my head, but the salmon was fresh and baked perfectly! . . Seafood: Sadly, they have this section at the start of the buffet line so you'll have to wait till you get to the front to dig in... I'm not a huge seafood fan, but my wifey does. Being the man of the year, I stacked a plate full of KING crab legs, oysters, mussels, AND JUMBO shrimp. You know a buffet is on another level when they offer jumbo shrimp. The oysters were fresh and simply amazing. My girl has very high expectations for seafood and Bacchanal exceeded those expectations. . . Desserts: My wifey loves her desserts and there were so many options to choose from... Cakes, macaroons, ice cream, ice cream cookie sandwiches, basically everything.. Basically, top selling items from well known dessert places all put together.. . Everything at the Bacchanal was amazing. The only negative was the misleading information by the manager working that day. A little shady that he urged us (group of five) to pay the extra $20 to go through express on a Monday afternoon w/ barely any people in line... Five-Stars for everything else.
This buffet is simply amazing! I've been here twice and have not been disappointed. They have so much high quality food to choose from. I suggest starting from the back and work your way towards the front. Make sure to try their crab legs & ask for them to be steamed. . . My little tip for going to for dinner without paying the dinner price is to go just a little bit before 3pm (when their lunch ends & dinner starts) and pay the lunch price. It might be a little early, but just don't eat a big lunch before you go. :) . . And don't skip the dessert! They've got a giant selection of dessert to choose from.
this is pretty darn close to what my dream buffet would be!. . 1. awesome seafood selection. 2. endless choices of delicious food. 3. amazing atmosphere/service. . I highly recommend this buffet to anyone visiting! I've had the chance to eat at Wicked Spoon and between the two I would pick this buffet for its variety. The food quality at wicked spoon is better but definitely the selection here is spectacular. It's a bit more expensive by a couple of dollars but worth it. . . I came here with a party of 16 for lunch and they were able to accommodate us pretty quickly. The wait wasn't too bad, the line moves quickly. It's a very open buffet, you can actually see the Caesar Palace pool as you're dining and the entire decor is very modern. Their service was great, the servers cleaned up the plates often and made sure we got our drinks. It was a little bit slow sometimes but I thought overall it was great. Their food selection was immense. They had everything from fresh seafood, barbecued meats, sushi, chinese, dim sum, salads, breads and cheeses, mexican, american, mediterranean, desserts, and more! I managed to try a bit of everything and enjoyed almost everything I got. Definitely the best thing was the crab and fresh shrimp they had. They were rather large pieces too which was nice! They also had delicious clams and chowders. Their desserts were great, they have a nice variety of sweets.. . I would love to come back again! I think for the price, selection, and quality this buffet is my first choice in Vegas.
This is the best looking and best laid-out buffet on the strip. The food was uniformly good. I gave only four stars because it is more expensive than all the other buffets, and I thought the Bellagio's food was slightly better.
Bacchanal is the best Vegas buffet on the strip HANDS DOWN!  Be prepared for the wait though... and the hefty price per person, of course.  We waited around 45 minutes on a Tuesday at 9PM.  They were at max capacity at one point too.. ON A TUES!  $50 per person for dinner.  . . They have it all from seafood, american, pizza, mexican, asian, sushi, bomb-ass desserts, and more.. . My favorites were:. . -The oysters on half shell.  They were so good! WTF?! Buffet oysters can be this good?! They didn't have Tabasco which is a MUST for me with oysters but their cocktail sauce with lemon made up for it. . . -Steamed Crab legs.  Although other places steam the crab legs for you... It comes already steamed here - so you don't feel like you're bothering the workers.  . . -Juices.  In the mexican food section, they serve fruit juices in little glass milk bottles.  I thought this was so interesting.  They have tamarind, hibiscus, strawberry, mango, and horchata.    . . -Lamb & Beef Ribs were SO GOOD!  The texture and seasonings were ON POINT.  I was pretty disappointed with the prime rib though... Maybe it was an off-day?. . -I am asian so I had to try one of their noodles w/ broth.  The guy recommended the Ramen broth so I got it with the udon noodles.   IT was SOOO good.  Reminded of a traditional Korean beef broth called sullungtang.   It is not miso based.. . -Desserts: They had gelato, ice cream sandwhiches, cake pops, macarons, macaroons, freshly made crepes, and assorted cakes & cookies.  All were yummy.  . . Other Vegas buffets usually have 3-4 really good dishes.. I felt that at Bacchanal, EVERYTHING was either pretty good or REALLY bomb!  Ugh.. I gained almost 5 lbs this Vegas trip and BACCHANAL is definitely to blame.  T.T
Hands down one of the best buffets I've ever had! The high quality and endless choices will leave you very satisfied! It has everything you can imagine, from Chinese to sushi..Mexican, Italian, huge salad & cheese bar to the different varieties of meats & my personal favorite the seafood selection. I had to go back for seconds and thirds for the oysters & crab claws! I'm not a big dessert fan but wow, the choices they offer here made me into one! The unlimited macaroons to the crepes was probably my favorite to name a few! Def worth the $50 for dinner!
Since my cousin was coming to Vegas for the first time, we decided to go to a buffet. We heard that the Caesar's Palace buffet recently opened (in 2012) so we decided to go. It's been a while since I've been to Vegas, but it's pretty cool that they have the queue machines now so you don't have to wait in line for hours! The price was $51/person.. . The thing I liked about this place was that there was a huge variety of cuisines/foods, and they're actually pretty good. However, the service killed it for me. Our waitress was horrible. However, I saw the other tables around us get a different waitress and she was super attentive. Because of this, I was a little annoyed. It took a while to get her attention to get utensils or drinks. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, and it wasn't that good. It wasn't fruityenough or alcoholic enough. . . Afterwards, I went to the dessert section and it looked amazing, but didn't taste that amazing. It was good that it wasn't too sweet though. However, when they were boasting about how they have "souffle made to order" I was disappointed that they said they "ran out". When it was like 7PM. I don't think that they really ran out, rather that they didn't have it at all.. . Overall, I thought the food was good, but I really don't think it's worth $51/person.
Was there today and overall it was a disappointment.  If you are going to try it based on hearing "it's the best buffet in Las Vegas" do lunch at around 2:30 pm.  (Lunch time pricing ends at 3:00pm) It is not worth more than $38.00.. I went for the seafood.  The quality is not up to standard. There was no king crab leg, and the large crab legs they put out on the seafood cold bar for dinner (Switchover is around 3:30 where they put out more items for the dinner bar) The crab legs were skimpy and FROZEN, not thawed out. (Maybe that was punishment for budget conscious people trying to get a dinner buffet, at a lunch time price, because they might be thawed out by 8pm for the mid dinner crowd. The crab legs that were a little thawed out were waterlogged.  The "shrimp cocktail" was yellowish, and waterlogged as well.  The mussels were not fresh, and the salmon was not fresh. The buffet (with the exception of the meat counter) had a hard time keeping the hot food from being cold thus the food is not maintaining the right temperature, which might be the reason people reported getting sick from the buffet in other reviews. From the time I got from the buffet, to my table, my pork ribs were cold.  They give you this rubber grabber for getting your dishes, as they warn you the dishes are hot, but I never used that thing. Dear Bacchanal Manager-- Save money, from buying those things and invest in the seafood part of the bar. As far as the desserts go, they are cute, but tasteless, with the exception of this dark chocolate mini cake with a raspberry on top, the fruit toppings and the creme brulee was good. My first experience of gelato was in Italy, so this gelato paled in comparison. The prime rib was the best thing on the bar, so I got my money worth on that and the sushi rolls were decent.  Save yourself some money, and do not pay extra for this buffet, it's not worth it.  (If you read the other reviews carefully they did state the quality went down, so be sure when you are looking at the photos look at the year the photos were uploaded).
This was my first meal of the day and everything tasted pretty great up until I got sick. I started with the cold sea food, worked my way to the hot foods, then barely made it to dessert because I guess the oysters weren't fresh enough and I swear I thought I would spend my entire EDC night in the porto potty. . . Cold sea food: . -Crab claws were still a struggle to open even if there was a premade crack, so I only attempted to eat 1 and the effort was not worth the tiny morsel of meat in there. -oysters tasted ok but made me sick. -ceviche was kinda skimpy with the seafood. -the salmon and tuna nigiri tasted like it's been sitting out for too long. -miso seabass was really good . . Hot food:. -lamb was over seasoned and super salty at least when I had it. -the sausages weren't  spectacular because it tasted like any other sausage I can get from costco. -the pork was dry . -king crab legs were pretty good and meaty. -pho broth was surprisingly delightful compared to all the weird pho at the other buffets. -the truffle in the tiny cute pot was very delicious I highly reccomended . . Desserts. -flan was super milky and creamy which was great. -best macarons out of all the other buffet macarons because it didn't taste overly artificial and still maintained the chewy texture. -I wanted to try the gelato but the oysters I ate earlier didn't settle too well with me
BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS! My family and I are extreme foodies when we go to Vegas on vacation and we have tried pretty much every single buffet. This one beats the Bellagio, the Wynn and the Wicked Spoon.  Everything is hot and the hospitality of the servers is incredible. The passion they have is exuded in the food they create. Wish I could just live there lol
Ok buffet but unfortunately I do not think it is worth the price you pay.. . I will go through this review station by station.. . 1) Asian Station: All of the food was decent enough and tasted like your run of the mill Chinese take out.  They did have strange pouchy things with meat in them that were ok.  Maybe I was there at a bad time, but the food tasted old.  My fiance liked it, but she is Asian.  Getting an Asian to like Asian food is like getting a dollar bill into a stripper's g-string (it isn't that hard).. 2) Carving Station: Brisket was very very fatty and tough.  It seemed very rushed as though they didn't have time to cook it properly or to trim the fat.  The pulled pork sliders were very good though and actually the highlight of the entire buffet.  But, the brisket was a disappointment.  I walked up to the station and said "I want some brisket" and the guy gave me a rectangle of lard and fat.  I then said "no...not lard...brisket."  Yeah...it was that bad.. 3) Pizza Station: The pizza was actually decent.  It was cooked in an actual pizza oven, and honestly I ate the pizza more than anything.  My fiance thumbed her nose at me thinking I was a peasant eating something so juvenile like pizza.  I needed to remind her that she did not have air conditioning until about 5 years ago....so I think our degree of class is about even at this point.. 4) Seafood Station: I heard there were crabs here and I was looking all over for them at this station.  No crabs....it seems the crabs were served later.  Instead they had crawfish, which were horrific (I am cajun) and some oysters (which I am not crazy enough to try).  You want to try raw oysters at a buffet then be my guest, but I will not pay for your investment in 2-ply toilet paper.  . Then....suddenly....the crab legs are served!!!  People jumped on them like they had "hot and cold runnin blondes" in them.  I do not know what that saying means, but I hear rednecks say it when something seems good.  Anyway, I grabbed some crab legs.  They were cold.....like iced down cold.  Weird, but I like cold seafood...and they were already cracked open for you.  Pretty cool.  Holy crap these things were full of salt.  Tons of salt.  That is all you could taste from these crab legs was salt.  Certainly this was a mistake right?  They couldn't be this salty on purpose could they?. . Big disappointment, but probably one of the better buffets on the strip....which is a sad state of affairs.  Go here if you want to experience a buffet and are starving....that is the only way you will make your money back.  Apparently I lost some class street cred.....thanks Bacchanal.
My advice is go REALLY hungry.  The food is incredible and there are MANY different varieties of it.  I've eaten all three meals there, and you definitely get more bang for your buck at lunch.  It is expensive.  It's about $35 for lunch.  You'll pay more than that at most good restaurants in town and for much smaller portions.
I usually don't like going to buffets, but when you are in Vegas you gotta try one of the buffets there.  I heard from multiple people that Bacchanal is the best, so I had to try it.  . . The decor was just beautiful especially for a buffet place.  This place is really big and spacious.  You don't feel like a sardine like other places where they try to pack as many tables back to back.  . . The food was good.  I don't know if I'll come back here again, but it was definitely a good experience eating here.  There were lots of variety and stations to catered to certain types of foods, like Asian, Italian, and American.  There was a giant dessert section, it was the bomb!  So many different kinda of desserts that'll you'll want to try it all!!!  One thing that I didn't like about the desserts was the gelato.  I thought it was dumb that they served it in warm bowls!  Like by the time I got back to my table the gelato was half melting and I was probably like 20 feet or less away from the dessert station.  Food over all was decent.  I kinda thought there would be more types of food going into the buffet, but after walking making my rounds, there were as much as I hoped for.  They had a meat craving station, so a chef is craving meat right in front of you.  I wanted to try the ribs, so when I got it I wasn't expecting it to be so big!  It took up my whole plate!  When I went to eat it I felt like a lot of it was fat.  Also the only utensil they will give you is a butter knife!  That butter knife did nothing!  We asked for a real knife, but they said they aren't allow to give us any.  So I didn't even want to try ordering more of their pieces of meats at the craving station cause it was so difficult to eat.  I liked a few of the foods in the Asian section.  . . By the way this was for lunch buffet.  It costed about 40 before tip.  Overall not bad.  If you r in Vegas, it's a one time must try.
I didn't think selections were that great for the price and I really didn't like having to wait so long 10-15 mins on the line before getting to first selection on seafood line. I actually prefer bellagio.
Oysters and seafood best. . Best tasting. . By gar better than Wynn but decore isnt all so great
One one the best buffets i ever tasted. The line was crazy long but worth it!! So much food to choose from, not just any food TOP NOTCH quality food! I'm so glad I choose to have my Birthday dinner here, because it was one of the best things I did while visiting Vegas!
Fuck this place, came in at 5pm just to wait till 8:30pm and get turned away?  That is bullshit, not just for my party of 5, but for the crowd of people behind us. We pretty much got told to go somewhere else for my brother-in-laws birthday. I will forever recommend everyone I can, to avoid this place.
I was excited to eat here more than I was for the reason I came to Vegas in the first place. So to say that it was just a little disappointing says a lot.. . Priced at 35$ (or was it 39..) for lunch, I was so happy when I arrived and there was no line. Once we saw that, me and my boyfriend went in for lunch even though we had planned to get a number for dinner. I started off my plate with brisket, pasta, little burger sliders, and scalloped potatoes for my meal. I was sad that they didn't put out the little baskets of tater tots and chicken strips that I see all over the photos on yelp=(  the brisket was delicious, nice and juicy on it's own. The men behind the counter were the sweetest and definitely didn't skimp out on sizes! When I ate the scalloped potatoes....my mouth died. I love carbs, so the cheese and potatoes were so darn good..... It's soft but not too over powering with the cheese. The burger slider was eh... Didn't taste at the standards it should have like the brisket and other things I tasted. The pasta I tried was bland, I don't even remember which one it is that's how much I enjoyed it. . . DESSERTS: I took two rounds of desserts, ONLY because the little plates they put them on wouldn't let me get all of it at once! The mint gelato was amazing...it's crazy how it comes from a buffet but the taste and texture is nothing but high quality! The green tea cookies and chocolate chip cookies were super soft and tasteful, I got an extra handful towards the end to take with me as I left=) The mouses and cupcakes were ok, a little too sweet in my opinion but texture and presentation was beautiful.. . Overall, I would definitely come back! Hopefully my expectations are met when I come for dinner next time.
LOVE IT!!!! Best buffett in Las Vegas.... quality is amazing!!!!! Food is awesome, I cant wait to come back....
I treated my bridesmaids to brunch after they planned a fun and unforgettable bachelorette  weekend for me back in May 2014.  Price for the brunch buffet was a little pricey at $45 per person but wow, Bacchanal offered a pretty amazing spread!  I got my fill of the crab legs and the craving station and a little bit of everything else. Desserts were yummy: gelato and chocolate-dipped strawberries were my fave.  Quality of the food was great and brunch included free flowing champagne or mimosas to keep the party going...
Overhyped! Seafood is good but meats are well done & full of fat/ grizzle. Dirty dipping cups stuck together. Serious lack of service - plate racks were left empty, drinks slow to be refilled & dirty plates stacking up at my table. Then they took our dirty plates & silverware! Took 5 mins to get us clean silverware. Won't go back.
Not impressed with the food. We went there on a Saturday night and the place was so busy. We paid $54 per person. We thought there will king crab legs but guess what?  No king crab legs, only snow crab. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down compared to other Yelpers who posted pictures and reviews.  The lamb chops and the prime rib were tough and the sushi quality was the same as the supermarket. The oysters smelled fishy and the stone crab legs were hard to eat.  Some of the Asian hot dishes were good (roasted duck). Where were the individual fried chicken baskets? And the Mexican corn on the cob? This place was just like any other buffet now but more expensive. Yes, there were plenty of food but will not recommend anyone to go there unless you like spending money for lots of bad food.
My all-time favorite buffet in Vegas, hands down. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this buffet. The choices are just superb! There's so much selection and they all taste amazing. I wish I had a second stomach just so I could eat even more. . . What's great about this buffet is that they have choices that people will eat. There's not many bizarre dishes that you'll wonder if you'll like or not. Their sliders are a must have. Their seafood selection is to die for. Oh the succulent Alaskan crab meat, oysters, clams...just absolutely amazing. . . Their dessert menu consists of a variety of gelato flavors, puddings, cakes, cookies, pastries and even a crepe station! I can't wait to be back in Vegas so I can have this buffet again!
So good, I mean it! So Good! I had poured over Yelp days before visiting Vegas trying to figure out if trying the buffets would be worth it, and even if I did try them which to go to. . . I finally caved and convinced Brandon that we had to go to Bacchanal. We went for lunch and even though their full selection wasn't available we were extremely happy with our meal. We both found plenty of items to love and I think I made the mistake of eating filling sushi first (pesky rice) which kept me from eating more of the delicious brisket. . . The best items I had were the sliders, prime rib, brisket and for dessert lemon sorbet. If I could go back I would just fill up on those items. (But everything is fantastic) It was one of those lunches where we ended up so full that we couldn't even think of having another bite, and weren't even hungry for the rest of the day. . . Writing this review I wish I could go back right now and experience it again!. . On top of the amazing food we had an amazing waitress who was very friendly and offered her advice on some of her favorites and was quick with drink refills and checked in on us many times throughout the meal even though the whole restaurant was crowded. Great service!! . . If you're in Vegas or trying to plan out your trip do not miss this buffet, even though it's expensive it is well worth it!
mmmmm  Big Buffet.. great food.   I have already recommended to others.  Not much other to say... look at all the reviews.  there all good!
"I'm usually not the Buffet type, "BUT"...... I'll make an exception for this one!" If I come to a buffet and have to wait 2 hours to get a table, "It had better be great!" Lol. "You better believe that this buffet was worth it!" . Allow me skip the part where I waited 2 hours to get in. It was a weekend, during dinner hours, at Caesars Palace, and on the famous Las Vegas Strip. So, Yes..."I understand that part "VERY" well when it comes to dining!" However, "I was there to dine!"  Upon entering the buffet, I notice the setup....."GREAT!" That's not what got my attention though. What got my undivided attention was the food displays. "Fresh, well presented foods!" I'm in food heaven? Fresh juices in individual glass bottles, oysters served on the half shell, displayed on a bed of ice for you to choose, desserts fit for royalty? "Maybe!" This is how a buffet "Should" be. Oh, and did I mention the fresh crab legs that are cooked right in front of you then pulled from the steamy pot then onto your plate????  "I'm sold there!"
