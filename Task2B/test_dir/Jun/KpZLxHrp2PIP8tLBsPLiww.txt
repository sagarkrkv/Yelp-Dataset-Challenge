I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE AT THE MGM SIGNATURE SUITES!!. . I came to vegas for M fest and to catch up with some friends, whom I haven't seen in over a year.  I was really excited to stay at the MGM signature due to all the fabulous reviews, plus I got a discount through my credit card travel services.  I booked the Balcony Deluxe Suites, for only one night (and thank god we only stayed for 1 night).  . . I show up to the hotel and the gate security was very kind and cordial, I ended up arriving to vegas 4 hours before our 3pm checkin, but concierge was gracious enough to hold our bags till our time came up.  . . We come back to the hotel after our lunch to find that the nearby convention crowd were all staying at the hotel.  It literally took 1.5 hrs to get to our room on the 3rd floor, because the lines to the elevator were so DAMN long. The concierge told us to lounge in the lobby or by the pool until the lines die down.  The convention crowd was like a sex and the city woman gathering.. I have never seen that many women in my entire life and they were all chattering in unison.. it was so strange.  . . I finally get to my room and... there's no FUCKING BALCONY.  I specially paid more to get a room with a balcony and my room was just a regular room..  I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from just waiting in the elevator line.. I brought this issue up during my checkout and all they did was WAIVE my $28 resort fee.. WTF can you FUCKING REFUND ME THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO ROOMS??! .. I have talked to my chase travel services and the hotel will not do anything about it!! Their customer service sucks ass.... I recommend you stay at the other hotels like Paris or Cosmopolitan. . . I'm disappointed!
Stayed at the signature sweets this past March and the place was impeccable. We had a corner suite on the 19th floor. What an amazing view! The room was huge with a full kitchen (pots and pans available at the front desk) two bathrooms, both with beautiful glass showers and the one attached to the bedroom included a jacuzzi tub, THREE sinks and two vanity areas. Lots of space for everyone to get ready and if you happen to be staying for a while, theres no reason you won't be comfortable kicking back at the hotel for a few hours each day. Plus we had access to all of the pools (5-10 i lost count including an adult area at mgm grand) even at the MGM Grand, all of which included outdoor bars. We really enjoyed our stay there.
Was not pleased with the valet service during my stay there. My car has air suspension and i could clearly tell that it had been messed with. I would have never left the car with them that low. I raised the car so they could drive it easier. I was not happy to see that had been touched. . . Next girlfriend and cousin found Cockroaches in the lobby and in the hallways. If you dont know what im talking about here is a link to what they look like:. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cockroach. . I got a handicap room when i did not ask for it. So i did not get the private toliet on its own. I got a smaller tub. and i got a bulky sitting area in my shower. I did not ask for this!. . Finallywhen we checked out on sunday i was welcomed with over $100 in resort fees. This was not part of my invoice when i booked online with their website. What was funny is that there were 3-4 people also checking out at the same counter i could all hear them complaining about the same thing i was! I feel that this is a bait and switch method of squeezing a couple of extra dollars out of you. Not happy with my experience at a MGM hotel in las vegas.
I have stayed at The Signature a few times now and overall have no major complaints, I have only stayed in the one bedroom balcony suites which are a great size and well appointed considering the reasonable prices. The location is a bit inconvenient especially if you are trying to walk out to the strip through the MGM. However the monorail is very convenient for getting to other casinos and out to the strip and not too far of a walk from the Signature towers. Access to MGM main pool and lazy river is another plus. I will continue to stay here on trips when a condo sized space is necessary.
I just came back from a 5 day trip to Vegas and the Signature did not disappoint at all! It was my first time staying here and I can honestly say it was a fantastic experience and I do plan on staying there again. From the moment we checked in Sherry Crudup took great care of us. . . Price wise we paid through a second party (not really sure how that happened - someone else in our group took care of it) and all I can say is it was steal for the amount of time we were there. There were 4 of us and with the regular bed and sofa pull out we were all comfortable. BTW.. I never thought I would say this but the sofa bed was utterly amazing and comfy - I chose to sleep in it every night rather than alternating with the others for the bed. . . The room was spacious and clean and we had a kitchenette which I highly recommend - we were able to have breakfast and lunch daily and only go out for dinner. Saved lots of $$ doing this. We were in Tower 1, on the 33rd floor, the views were great. I did hit the fitness center 2x during our stay and was happy with the abundance of towels, fruits, excellent equipment and cold water. . . Location wise you do have to realize that you are NOT on the strip but do have to walk about ten to fifteen minutes to get to it. If you are fine with this then it really is not a big deal. As soon as we got there we went to the Walgreens on the strip and stocked up on any other food we were missing. I liked that this hotel shares the MGM amenities so going to the lazy river is as easy as flashing your room key and you are in. . . All in all i am really happy we decided to stay here and highly recommend it to everyone!
I really enjoyed my stay at the Signature this past week.  The hotel is located slightly off the strip, but is connected to the MGM Grand by an air-conditioned walkway.  I wanted a quieter hotel, with less noise and partying, and the Signature delivered that.  The valets were much quicker than at the MGM Grand, and the hotels have their own private pools and fitness centers.  . . My only complaint was that I booked a 1 bedroom suite, and when I initially arrived, I was put in a handicapped suite with no Jacuzzi.  After I called down to the front desk about it, they moved me to a different 1 bedroom suite with a Jacuzzi and a beautiful view of the strip.  The room was really well appointed, with a huge sub zero fridge, nice TVs and comfortable furniture.  I wish they'd put a couple of patio chairs on the balcony because there's no where to sit out there without dragging the chairs from the kitchen table.  And I also wish they'd use different pillows on the beds, or at least offer a mix of pillows, because the ones they use are way too squishy and offer no neck support, but that's nit-picking. . . Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, and I'd definitely stay at the Signature again.
Favorite hotel so far in Vegas as far as the rooms go. Very classy. Private driveway with huge double door gate to enter the hotel, reminiscent of a mansion. Free valet! Love that they have kitchens in all the rooms. Really nice jet bathtub as well. I've stayed in a regular room, a suite, and the penthouse suite...pleased with all of them. :) No long lines to check it. Reasonable price for a a nice room. Customer Service is also great, when they heard we were staying for my brother's wedding, they upgraded all our rooms for free.
We've done Vegas many, many times staying everywhere. First time here though. Room 33188 closest to elevator and ice machine in tower 3. It's the furthest to the main MGM property but not a big deal for us as gaming was just a small part of our stay. Great gym here. Newspapers are not on your door like other resorts but in the lobby. Room itself is impressive especially as we got it for $90 using the old fart discount (AARP) and they never asked for a card. Was so impressed with the stay wanted to extend 2 more nights. Bad timing as a large group coming in. They offered me one more night $220. Came back later and it was $180 but they'd do me a deal for $140. Thought I was in a car dealership so offered them $120. A side trip to the manager and deal done. The place is impressive. Hope you get a good deal.
I would have to say this is one of the best hotels in Vegas as far as service and value.  I have been staying here with my family for the past four years for at least a week at a time.  The check in process is simple and fast.  I have yet to wait more than 5 minutes to get checked in.  As far as the value, I think its great for what you get.  The towers are a bit off the strip so it cuts down on the drunk and crazy (not that there is anything wrong with that in Vegas) crowd of the hotels on the strip.   I only say this because I bring my two kids with me and I like the family atmosphere The Signature provides.  . The rooms are excellent, clean, and comfortable.  It is worth the money to get the one bedroom suite for the balcony, full kitchen, and extra space.  Well, I can go on and on about this place but you just have to experience it one time and you will be sold like I was.  . Make sure you shop around for the best deals and if you are a M life member the rates are always better (Sometimes you get $50 bucks free for room service)
Stayed here with my hubby and two little ones. Stayed in a one bedroom suite. It was big which works great! My big issue with this place is the cleanliness. I found a condom wrapper next to the bed but what took the cake was a pill next to the night stand! Thank goodness I always scan hotel room because I could not imagine if one of my little ones got a hold of that who knows what pill and put it in their mouth! Very upset about this! I wrote this on the customer review but never heard from them.
So the look of the room I was very impressed at first with the look of the room very cute then when I turned on my air on high the smell of vomit was coming out of the vent absolutely awful! The smell seemed to finally go away then the last day my girlfriends and I were there I noticed on the underside of the comforter was a huge yellow mustard looking stain and some brown stains if I hadn't pulled it back I would've never noticed then I examined the sheets and the bed had to sheets on it and both were dirty with random stains I pulled all the sheets off the bed and on the mattress cover I saw hair that was clearly not me or my friends and we didn't sleep on the mattress cover so it couldn't of been ours an what absolutely disgusted me was the pubic hair on the cover absolutely disgusting!!!!!!!! And when I wanted to check in only an hour early and the rooms were supposedly already ready they charged 22 dollars just to check in an hour early which was ridiculous. And when I let the front desk know they weren't apologetic and the maid service manager only said I'm sorry and thanks for letting him know! I will not be staying here again! Seriously to not change the sheets nasty!!!!!
We are currently staying at the signature. This was an annoversary present from a family member, who prebooked and payed. Anyway, the did hit us with additional resort fees and taxes, no idea why this was not includable in the prepay. The huge tub had hairs in it! Bathroom floor was cleaned, but thegrout has funky stains. And the coffee and tea selection (for which we pay, among other things, the resort fee) is eay sub par. . . Yes, it is a nice place. Bed is comfy, it has the usual anemities i am use to and expectin this price category. But all ofthe above make me not going back here after this stay
This was the second time we stayed at the Signature and we were again not disappointed.  The room was lovely, although they could update their TV's since they are pretty small in a space that could support a larger one.  We had a balcony suite with a great view of the strip and background mountains.  These rooms are nice if you are staying more than a couple of days as they have kitchenettes if you want to cook in your room and not spend all your hard earned cash on the many great restaurants in Vegas.  Located behind the MGM Grand, you will do a fair amount of walking to get to the strip without a cab or personal vehicle.
I have had better experiences at other hotels with less stars.. . Parking: Valet service is nice and you do not have to worry about finding a spot and walking to the hotel, but this is the only option you have for parking. They only had a couple of valet attendants to work and it took up to 20 minutes for them to retrieve my vehicle. . . Room: The room was clean and the bathroom was large. The room did have a mini refrigerator, microwave oven, and a stove. The room felt like a mini studio apartment. The bed was not of the best quality,  it was hard and springy. One of the worst nights of sleep I have had in Las Vegas, I awoke the next more with tremendous back pain. The next two nights I slept on the couch, which was still uncomfortable, but I could a least i could get some rest. The walls are on the thin side, I was able to here the people next door and people in the hallway talking as they walked down the way. I had no maid service for two days and had to call the lobby for extra towels and toiletries, which they brought up quickly. . . Pools: Since the Signature is part of the MGM Grand I was able to use the MGM Grand pools including the lazy river. The pool area though is a party area with loud music and rude people, so be prepared. Back at the Signature pool area, the concrete is very slippery and I witnessed many people falling. I even fell when I took off my sandals and the guy at the bar noticed and said I was cut-off, I was not even drinking. . . Overall: Maybe 2 star

If you don't want to stay right on the Strip, the Signature Towers are a fantastic choice. The rooms are very nice - albeit I wish the bathroom lighting were better for applying makeup. They have balconies which I love. . . Tower 3 is the farthest from the MGM, but is right on Harmon so if you want to walk up to the strip you can go out the back way, up Harmon and within 10 minutes be up at the Cosmopolitan. Tower 2 has the Delights Bistro. Tower 1 has it's own Starbucks with no lines which is great as the one in the MGM food area always has about 100 people  in line. Tower 1 also has a 24 hour business center - it's basically two computers and a printer but just fine for printing your boarding pass. They all have a check-in desk and valet parking as well. . . The Towers are connected so you don't ever have to go outside on your way to the MGM or the Grand Pool Complex. The walkways between towers feature the moving sidewalks to speed you along. Each Tower has it's own pool area as well. The Tower Pools are way more chill than the big pool area so depending on your mood their's a pool for you.. . The only downside to the rooms is the small TV with the cruddy picture. We didn't watch much TV so we survived, but the TV set up doesn't really fit with the rest of the room. Our room had a nice under sink fridge, a microwave, sink and even a stove top range. We had a deluxe suite on the 20th floor (#815). We had a great view of the strip skyline. There is ample storage in the room for an extended stay as well. It would have been nice to have some wall hooks to hang wet suits and towels on. They have an i-Pod dock radio, but it doesn't work with i-phones. So if you want to play music through it bring a regular i-Pod. . . I really enjoyed out stay here. We didn't need to leave at all. We went to Hakkasan two nights, the Grand Pool Complex Lazy River Pool everyday, ate at the restaurants in the MGM and Towers. The airport is no more than 10 minutes a way max. . . I liked staying here better than my usual Palazzo - better price, easier to get around and not insanely crowded everywhere you go. We'll be back for sure and the MGM Signature will likely become or go to/regular hotel in Las Vegas.
