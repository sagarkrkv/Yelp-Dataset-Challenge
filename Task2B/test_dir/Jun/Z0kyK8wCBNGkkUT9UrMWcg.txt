This is one classy joint and the meals there will not disappoint.. . For appetizers we ordered Oysters on a Half Shell. This was my first time eating raw oysters on a half shell, I was a tad hesitant at first, but I read about them and was excited to try them.. . When the oysters came out to the table they had 3 different choices of sauces to douse your oysters with: One sauce contained red wine vinegar with chopped onions, 2nd a cocktail sauce, and side of freshly grated horseradish, of course a wedge of lemon.  . . The first oyster I partook in, I only added the lemon juice and horseradish. With little hesitation I shucked the oyster in my mouth the cold, slippery mollusk hit my tongue like a wave from the ocean. I slightly chewed and swallowed, I LOVED IT!. . The next Oyster I ate, I put some of the vinegar sauce on it, as well as some cocktail and horseradish, and a splash of lemon juice.  This oyster was slightly bigger and different than the one I had prior, I think this was from the east coast.  Anyway, I shucked it, chewed it, and swallowed.  This was so delicious, It was almost like tasting the sea breeze, and the after taste was of melon. Kind of like the taste of a watermelon rind. I was shocked to have tasted this, because I wasn't sure my taste buds were to detect it.. . For dinner I  ordered the 16 oz Prime Strip.. . My friends ordered one 16 oz Lobster, and the fish of the day which was Flounder.. . As for the sides: Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin, and Asparagus.. . The waitstaff serve you each individually asking if you would like each side, and they place the sides on your plate at the table.  They melt the butter for your lobster at the table as well.. . The prime strip melted in my mouth, so tender and juicy, I didn't need any sauces or anything, It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The waitstaff waited for us to take the first bite and asked if everything was prepared to our liking before leaving the table.. . The side dishes were out of this world! My favorite was the lobster macaroni and cheese.  It was so delicate and delicious.  The flavors all combined perfectly and was unlike any other macaroni and cheese I had eaten before.. . The asparagus was crunchy and fresh, lightly salted with almonds and olive oil.. . The potatoes au gratin were cheesy and creamy, definitely one of the best sides to have with a nice juicy steak.. . I tasted my friends flounder with couscous, it was so fresh and flaked off in your mouth like it was meant to be there all along.. . You cannot forget the mouth watering Lobster tail that my other friend had.  So juicy and meaty. The butter paired with it so well, it was like a velvety blanket of love.. . For dessert the brought out a 7 layer lemon cake for my birthday! The most moist cake I have ever eaten. My taste buds were in heaven and I couldn't believe all the wonderful things I was tasting!. . I cannot wait to go back to Del Frisco's again!. . BTW order a lemon drop martini, they are amazing there.
I swear I reviewed this place.. yelp are you removing my reviews?!. . well here we go again then!. . I am a very very picky steak eater, I love steak and am pretty hard to impress.. . but, the steak here impressed me. I honestly forgot what I got since it was a while ago but I remember it being amazing, I do remember that I added the peppercorn extra for a few dollars and it was totally worth it. cooked and marinated perfectly, steak melted in my mouth!. . the sides on the other hand were not so amazing, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and the corn tasted like it was from a frozen bag BUT the point is this is a steakhouse so you come for the steak, not the sides (or that disgusting wine I got) I wanted to try some new wine so I asked for a recommendation and they were very helpful (can't fault the service for how the wine tastes right?) but the wine they suggested tasted like cough syrup! :(, . . but keep in my with my disappointment in the wine and sides.. I still give it 5 stars? that's how good the steak was.. service was amazing as well! definitely will be coming back when I'm in vegas :)
Ordered the veal porter house and my girlfriend ordered the filet mignon. Both steaks were amazing! The best steaks I've had in a long time. If you like Ruth's Chris, this place tops it. Service is great as well.
Went to this place as a group dinner (for bachelor party). . . Parking is valet or a private lot. We took a limo there so not sure how much valet is. It's a pretty big restaurant, i think the capacity was around 500. Hosts/Hostesses were polite and courteous. They also have a pianist playing in the main lobby area. Decor is just nice. Nothing too crazy or fancy but just fancy & nice enough. . . We got the 32 Oz Wagyu beef for the groom and rest of us got the Prie-Fix menu with the 16 oz upgrade (Prie fix was 49 and you add $12-15 more for the upgrade, not a bad deal if you love meat). We all got different side items (creamed spinach, corn, crab cakes, shrimps, lemon garlic scallops). Crab cakes were delicious as mentioned by other reviews. I liked the scallops and the creamed spinach. I don't think the mashed potatoes were that great but some of my friends seemed to really enjoy them. . . The Meat, obviously is the main focus of this place (being a steak house). All the meats were cooked real well. It was seasoned well and the the portion size is pretty damn huge so come hungry and ready to devour. I had a hard time finishing my plate. Service was impeccable as our waters were constantly being re-filled and tables being cleaned. . . It is definitely on the pricey side so I'd recommend coming here for a special occasion.
Wow, great steak. I ordered the american wygu tomahawk ribeye. And we also ordered the 1/2 pound king crab. We should have ordered the full pound half was too small. Everything was great!. The service was incredible from the hostess that greets you at the door to the team of servers that take care of you at the table.. For dessert we itdered the banana bread pudding. It was delicious just wish i had a little more ice cream. . The wife got the vip martini and she loved it.
I am a foodie and a fussy steak consumer.  Having worked for a couple years in the high end restaurant industry I'm extraordinarily critical about service and standards.. . Del Frisco's is the finest steakhouse I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.  This place is head and shoulders above the other pretenders.  If those other steakhouses even dream about competing they better wake up and apologize.  Any fan of the competition has never eaten here.  That's it.  End of story.. . I never visit a city with a Del Frisco's without stopping by.  I have converted many non-believers to the mantra that this is the best steak and restaurant experience they have ever had.. . Treat yourself!
I was a little disappointed, considering the high reviews and the namesake of the restaurant.  Here's why:. . The PROS:. 1) THE STEAK:  we got the signature Double Eagle cut medium rare.  It's true what people say - that the steak are a little undercooked than you're used to - HOWEVER, the steak is so gorgeously cooked, it didn't bother me at all.  The steak had a lovely crust on it with great seasoning, and the inside was a little undercooked but the steak's flavor and tenderness was so good that it didn't matter.. 2) THE CHOUX CORN:  Really interesting twist to creamed corn.  It's cooked with bacon bits and poblano pepper bits.  It's just a tad creamy - not too decadent, which is a nice change because the steak was very decadent.  . 3) THE ATMOSPHERE:  The place is really nice - lots of mahogany wood and glass.  It also smelled of cigar which gave it that Vegas/baller air to it.. . The CONS:. 1) Our seating area:  The hostess sat us next to a table with 2 kids in their party.    We were obviously a couple trying to have a nice dinner, but the 2 kids were so noisy and whiney - it killed the mood until they left after we finished our appetizer.  I wish they were cognizant of what kind of dining atmosphere a couple would want.. 2)  The sides:  lobster mac and cheese - unfortunately the lobster was so fishy, I just took a few bites and was over it. No offense, but Mastro's lobster mac and cheese still takes the crown.  The dish was also not cheesy - it was creamy but I'd like to see strands of melted cheese getting pulled as I spoon it onto my plate and into my mouth.  The spinach supreme - I usually love bacon.  I seriously do.  This dish had half bacon, half spinach/sauteed onion.  I was expecting bacon bits accenting the dish - I wish they asked me, "would you like some spinach with your bacon supreme?"  =(. 3)  Service:  She was good but she didn't ask us if we were here for a special occasion or if it was our first time here.  It was our anniversary and it was indeed our first time, but I'm not going to mention it if she's not going to ask us.  I feel like if I do that, then I'm asking for a dessert handout - which I'm always welcome to, but I'm not a beggar.. 4)  Dessert:  She recommended the lemon cake and the chocolate mousse.  We went with the mousse.  It was good but we were so surprised at how dense the chocolate mousse was.  It was way too rich, so we started eating only the fluffy marshmallow top instead.  They have sorbets but no ice cream variety - only vanilla - that was really disappointing because we expected at least a variety of basic ice cream from a fancy place.. . Overall, the steak carried the stars to this rating.  The steak is truly amazing, amazing enough to visit an off-strip restaurant, but unfortunately everything else fell short.  . . I don't think we'll return but we were glad that we tried it.
Amazing steaks and even better customer service without the inflated prices of steakhouses on the Strip!  Del Frisco's ranks up there as one of my favorite steak houses anywhere!. . My friends and I did a side-by-side comparison of the 22oz Bone-In Prime Ribeye ($56) and the off menu 32 oz " American Wagyu" Long Bone Ribeye ($90).  Both were excellent and came out a perfect medium rare.  So much glorious beefy flavor I could hardly contain my excitement!  The flavor and quality was very similar to the bone-in ribeye at Mastro's which is my all time favorite steak.. . Honestly though, I could not tell the difference between the Wagyu and the regular bone-in ribeye.  The Wagyu was supposed to be more marbled, more tender, more flavorful-- hence the higher price tag.  But if not for the Wagyu having that ridiculously long bone, I would have never tasted a difference.  Unless you have money to burn, I would recommend just sticking to the regular ribeye and saving some money.. . I can't say enough about the customer service.  Everyone from the girl who took the reservation, to the hostess, to the servers were all super friendly.  Our waiter in particular was very knowledgeable about the menu, from the steak, to the seafood to the booze.  Their blitzkrieg method of bringing everyone food all at once is awesome.  There were literally 4 people at our small table cleaning up plates and dropping off food all in one fast fell swoop.  And speaking of booze, I highly recommend the VIP, a pineapple infused vodka cocktail.  Delicious and refreshing.  Get a pitcher because you're gonna want more than just one.. . The only part of Del Frisco's that disappointed me was the sides.  We got garlic mash, sauteed mushrooms, and creamed corn.  They were all acceptable, but nothing really stood out.  Mastro's has their black truffle gnochi.  Lawry's has their creamed corn.  I think Del Frisco's lacks a signature irresistible side dish.  This is probably the only thing that prevents this from being a true 5 star review.. . 4.5 stars rounded up!
This place is a little off the strip but is and aaammmaazziinggg steakhouse. Possibly the best I have ever been to. They have plenty of parking in their own private parking lot.. . On to the food. I ordered like a three course meal of some sort. First was the salad. I got the wedge salad with avocado ranch and it was delicious. Then I got the filet cooked well done but it was a tad red for me. Luckily when they bring out your steak they ask you to cut it open to make sure it is cooked to your liking. If it is not they happily take it back for you and cook it longer. The steak was juicy tender and delicious. For the sides I got the lobster mac n cheese and creamed spinach based on the recommendation of our server. The creamed spinach was so gooooddd. You must order it. I will probably get two all for myself next time. Since it was my birthday they brought out a complimentary slice of the lemon cake. It was also very delicious and should definitely be ordered by everyone. It is super moist and has the right amount of frosting. It just melts in your mouth. . . The service here was awesome. I think our servers name was anna or something and she was so nice and funny. Definitely come visit this place if you are in vegas.
Super disappointed with my experience tonight. We made an 8:30 reservation, waited till 9:05 and still not sat, nor were we approached about the unnecessary wait considering we had a "reservation". The hostess staff is completely clueless, and worthless.   Kept telling us "a couple more minutes" when clearly that ran out awhile back.  I appreciate honesty, and truth.  You can't control the course of the night, but can tell a guest when they are clearly 45mins from being sat.  Otherwise, management needs to be re-evaluated.  The restaurant gets one star only because the bartender was amazing and sensed we were annoyed and did what he could to keep us interested.  Only heard wonderful words about their steaks, but will not return to Confirm because it is RUDE to not honor your guests reservations.  I don't care how good your steak is, it's garbage if the experience before or after is subpar.
I love Del Frisco's.. . This is my favorite steak place in vegas.  The service is always super friendly, and the steaks are not as pricey as you find on the strip.. . The bread is amazing.  They have specials off menu, as many steak houses do, and the Bone-in Filet was the highlight of my night.. . If you fancy a drink, their old fashioned is on the mark.
Heard about this place because of its great Yelp reviews so decided to check it out.  There is a good reason it has 4.5/5 stars with almost 800 reviews. It is a very chill yet classy setting inside. I like the fact it is off the strip so it isnt overly crowded and touristy but yet it is still busy.  Everyone was very friendly from the hostess, to the bartender to the server and the manager also touched down at our table after the meal. . . We got the seafood/shell fish appetizer to start that had crab claws, crab legs, oysters and shrimp which was a bit expensive maybe for the size of the platter but overall great quality. They could have maybe threw an extra crab leg or claw on there.  We also split a wedge salad that was on point. . . For the main course we both got the lump crab cakes in lobster sauce which were amazing. Some of the best crab cakes we have had in Vegas. Im sure the steaks are great too but we have been shying away from red meat as of late.  . . It is a very nice establishment and you should dress accoringly not your shorts, flip flops or tank top kind of place. . . Overall a great experience and we will visit again sometime!
This was our first time to this location of Del Frisco's.  The restaurant was empty (and its SAT night...hmm....) other than one table for two in which they seat us right next to that table......and by the back area where all of the servers hang out and talk LOUDLY.  The service was not great as the only other table that came in was a large party of 12 which they shifted tables and put them right next to us.  So, our server completely abandons us and goes to help them. (Why not one of the other 20 servers standing there talking?????)  I had to finally flag down someone to get our check!  Food was ok, nothing spectacular, just OK.  Too many other fabulous steak and seafood places to go to for the same price point such as Mastro's which I highly recommend.  MUCH better ambience and top notch service there at Mastros! Del Frisco is an outdated, stuffy feeling place and for what ever reason, it smells like the sewer in there but it may be just the old carpet.  DEFINITELY needs updating.  There are too many other great places in Vegas to go here again...not for us!
