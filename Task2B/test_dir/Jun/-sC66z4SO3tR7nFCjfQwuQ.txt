This place is awesome! Everything tasted fresh. If I have visitors from out of town and they ask for good Mexican food, I will take them here. I am still eating and I couldn't wait to write the review. My only complaint is that they need a new bar manager. The drinks were not very good. Margaritas were not great. Bloody Mary's were just okay. Overall, really good. Boom! Finally found a good Mexican spot.
We came here last evening to celebrate our anniversary and we had a great time.  . . Sure, it was 106 and we had to sit outside, but the food as always, was great, outstanding and delicious. Now where's my Roget's?  Just read my original review from last year. . . And, who would sit through a cool Arizona evening (LOL) as we did, on our anniversary, ifthe food wasn't delicious?  . . We have tried almost everything on the menu, the fish taco, the shrimp, the Carne and everything is good.  But we comeback for the Carne Asada.   You've got to try it!  Their tacos are very good, but we much prefer the Burritos and highly recommend their white sangria. . . Expect to spend about $25 each for a three course meal including drinks, excluding tip. BTW, those are Happy Hour prices, which run until 6 pm including on Saturdays.  Most items on their menu are $1-3 off.. . So Four and a Half Stars, up from Four.. . Enjoy!
One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. The tomatillo salsa is so good, I wish it was served with all their dishes. The prices are awesome, especially during happy hour.
Went for lunch and based on some hype my group was excited to try the guacamole and margarita's. The group I was with all agreed that the drinks were not good, the bartender needs to revisit the drink list. The guacamole was just okay, the chips were pretty greasy. We really enjoyed the $2 quesadillas and the carne asada tacos, homemade corn tortillas! which were excellent. Will give a second chance.
This place was fantastic, best shrimp and tuna taco I had in a long time. . Service was great and so was atmosphere. . Breakfast menu looks great can't wait to try.
I mean they have the best tacos I've had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is great and their drinks are great. Slightly overpriced for a street taco but still good.
They have the BEST salad I've had in my life!!  Ensalada Cortada. Multiple ingredients that go perfectly together. A good happy hour, good local beers on tap and solid for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bartender, Christie couldn't have been more helpful and delightful. I love this spot!
I have been here once before and was impressed with everything about it but when I brought my fiance here, it was terrible. We were seated right away and our drink order was taken and brought quickly and then we waited another 15 minutes before getting up and walking out. It wasn't busy, 4 other tables were sat and already had their food. We watched as the 2 male servers passed by us multiple times barely glancing at us and going to chat with the tables who already had their food. The last straw that made us walk out was that another man came in and was sat and brought a menu and the waiter waited right there at his table to take his order then immediately went to punch his order into the computer. The only thing that kept me from asking for a manager was the fact that they didn't make us pay or the coffees we ordered AFTER the fact that we announced that no one ever came to take our order.
I love the tacos here along with the guacamole. The guac has citrus fruit chunks in it that give it a sudden sweet taste. We had our friends bachlorette dinner here.  Margaritas recommended ;)
Polo Asada was really good! Service was superb and the drinks had all the love of a great bartender!
The only thing I disliked about this place was the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. It felt like the server just didn't want to serve us, or maybe it was her last table and she was done for the day. We sat down she brought us our drinks and we never saw her again. We waited finally 30 min to ask someone else if we could order. We could also see our original waiter sitting down chatting and counting her tips. The food was amazing and the pork belly tacos are a MUST try. I've worked as a server before so I tried not to get too angry. I would try this place again but if service is this bad I will just ask for it togo.
Service has really gone down in this place.  You have to ask for your coffee refill and they did not bring all of my breakfast at one time had to wait 5 minutes for my tortillas and by that time the eggs and chorizo were cold.  Not a good experience which is sad as the food is usually great and it's one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Looks like it might be time to find a new one
I very rarely give a bad review but I HATE being ignored... I tip a lot . . Big mistake, huge.. . Ah, well I'm off to find another place to spend my $$ :)
I have to echo a previous comment, this place has gotten worse over the past year or so. Friends and I would love coming here for lunch - great food, good service. The past three times I've been here I've been really turned off. We were seated on the patio and waited well over ten minutes to even get a water. Our server constantly ignored us (had to waive him down to get coffee and soda) and we waited well over a half hour for breakfast burritos which came out cold and bland. I'm planning on avoiding this place from now on, which is a shame. This used to be a local spot I really enjoyed
Do not go alone! Food prep takes forever (28 min for 3 street tacos) making for an awkward lunch. The waiter I started with was inattentive and unhelpful. This was interesting because there were 5 customers and 4 waiters when I got there. A waitress ended up performing the first waiter's job.. . I was fairly hungry, so the food part of the meal should have won me over easily. It didn't. The fish taco was the best and it was only okay (try la santisma for better). You can get better carne asada and pork tacos at any one of the 1000 taquerias in Phoenix.. . By the time I was done inhaling my food (nearly late for work), I went to pay my bill at the front because nobody was around to get a bill to my table. The original waiter came to the register and said "We got busy."  I am sorry you had to cover 5 tables instead of two sir. I hope my tip went to the waitress that was actually able to serve me food (I left a note with that instruction).. . I know one bad review won't change the public perception on the restaurant, but I do hope that Gallo Blanco can take note of a couple gaps in their operations. Time to create a better working staff organization model that is not so overwhelming to the waiters and cooks.
Killer tacos and awesome guac. Live this place. Great prices for happy hour. I want to try the burritos next time. So very good!
