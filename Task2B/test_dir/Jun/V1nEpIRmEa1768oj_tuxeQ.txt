I absolutely LOVE Cibo,. I used to live downtown and remember when it opened. So quaint, so delicious. I live in the North valley now and miss my walk over to Cibo. Anytime I head downtown I make a stop by Cibo! Try it, you will love it!
Finally tried this place, and I definitely get what all the fuss is about!. . I really like the atmosphere at Cibo. I was gonna say it's a "cute little place" because that's how it feels, but I think it's a lot bigger than it actually appears (as I was leaving I noticed that the patio really does have a lot of seating). It seems like there's a lot of separatelittle rooms each with a few tables, which I kind of like because even though this place gets busy you still can carry on a conversation with your party without feeling like you have to shout over loud noise. . . As for food, I can honestly say the calzone I had was one of (if not THE) best I ever had. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to calzones, but the one at Cibo isn't quite as "heavy" compared to most places (the crust surrounding the cheese & meats is thinner), but it's HUGE & very filling. The lighter crust (& cheese) doesn't make you feel like there's a huge rock in your gut when you're finished even thought you just finished something so mammoth (and yes, I did finish my calzone). The other people I was with all had pizzas & they all found them to be yummy. I should note (and I'm pointing out my own stupidity here), the calzone at Cibo is listed on the menu w/the pizzas (they only have one calzone listed). The pizzas at Cibo all have special Italian sounding names. I actually thought I was ordering a pizza called the "calzone" and planned on sharing it w/the others in my party who were all sharing pizzas. I was a little surprised when I got an ACTUAL calzone (I know, silly me). Anyway, my friends had more than enough pizza to share with each other and I ate the whole calzone myself!. . My friends ordered a couple of desserts, which I didn't plan on trying, but decided when in Rome, why not! I had a couple of the donut ball things dipped in nutella (sorry, don't know what they're actually called), and they were heaven. A couple other friends split whatever the crepe w/fresh fruit & whipped cream is called, and well, I probably ate at least half of it. So, yeah.... . The service at Cibo is a little slow, but it gets crowded so that's understandable (I was here on a Friday). Our server was very friendly & helpful, though. I'll be back!
Very nice ambiance; however, I was not crazy about the service that was provided. . . Our server was really uninterested to be there, didn't seem like she cared at all. She has handed us two different manus and soft drinks were priced diferantley on both.
My favorite Phoenix lunch spot. Food is served quickly, always consistent and fantastic. Always. I think the staff are wonderful and friendly, their iced tea is so delicious. Being vegan, I either get the cous cous salad or the vegtariano without cheese. That sandwich is sooo good, and if you happen to save half for later, it tastes great afterwards too. . . I love love love Cibo. Best patio, delicious food, friendly staff. Best of Phoenix for sure.
LOVE CIBO. Arugula and fungi pizza is my favorite.
The meat and cheese board is out of this world, and a great way to start the meal. Layer on top-notch pizza after that, and there are few places that compare!
Love this classic downtown location! Perfect for a friendly happy hour, quick take-out, visitors from a far, or a romantic date. Service is always friendly.
Pizza was great. Got 2 pizzas with one type on each side(4 types). Sausage, spicy pepperoni, the Preston and potato one and prosciutto one. Prosciutto was the best then sausage. Watch out the spicy pepperoni will be too hot for kids. Crust was amazing. Green salad was good. Big portions can feed 2 adults per pizza.
Decent food, nice patio.
Margherita pizza with baby arugula and prosciutto added after cooking...appetizer plate with cannellini bean substitution (a few years back)...crepe suzette....Cutest patio ever and great small bar where you can eat on your own!!!
The service and atmosphere were so bad that we left before we ordered anything. So my score is not based on the food, which I hear is delicious. . . We were seated behind some obnoxiously loud lady who was over-explaining to her friend how poorly her coworker taught K-12 chemistry...and was getting almost everything wrong herself (I have a PhD in molecular genetics, so the convo was like listening to nails scraping a chalkboard). That's neither here nor there. Our bad experience was enhanced by this.. . So barely being able to hear myself think, I try to order a drink. The cocktail selection stinks for a place that appears to have an open bar. Plus, the waitress wasn't very helpful at all. She offered the peach bellini and then quickly retracted when she noted that they were out of the peach ingredient. Really?. . Then trying my best to speak over Loud-Talker explaining that all you needed to demonstrate "splitting atoms" is two styrofoam balls and a toothpick...nuclear fission with toothpicks...I asked the waitress if they had anything akin to an Italian soda, or maybe a soda/ seltzer with a splash of vodka and some flavor. What I figured was a simple request was impossible at Cibo.. . We left as Loud-Talker proclaimed that grade school kids don't need to learn chemistry, just general science...and we wonder why AZ's 8th graders rank #45 in the nation in STEM topics.. . All in all, our waitress was aloof from the moment we sat down. She was either spaced out or just had no people skills. Having the atmosphere ruined by Ms. Loud-Talker was our own bad luck, but I still give this place one star for the poor service.. . We left and went to The Vig next door. That place rocks.
great place.  however, it did not meet my personal taste buds.  my friends and their co workers love this place and give it five stars.  the patio is super nice on a nice weekend afteroon - when the weather is cool.
We have been countless times for but lunch and dinner and have always had a wonderful experience.  The food, ambiance, and staff are incredible.  Actually, the pizza is the best I've ever had.  The Margarita is a tried and truebut my new favorite is the "La Noce".
Great environment outdoors especially and lots of interesting people.  The food is fantastic never had anything that wasn't great!
Reboot Technology Services. . I have taken both my laptops and cpu's to Drew.  His turn around time is quick and the work done is always top notch.  My computers are VERY old and he keeps them running.  He has a back-up service as well.  I would not take any of my computers anywhere else.
Ah-mazing! I love this Phoenix gem! It's my go to for celebrations, a place to take visiting guest, date night, night with the girls, all occasions! Prepare to indulge and do not count count calories.  You're eating quality ingredients with remarkable flavors.  The Barrata is superb! Smooth creamy Barrata with aged sweet balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of prosciutto on toasted bread is a must! Pizzas, oh the pizzas...are made in a wood fired oven and offer the perfect toasted yet chewy crusts. I highly recommend the Diavola if you like spice.  You can always add a touch of coolness by adding ricotta cheese. Secondly I recommend their Salsiccia con Potate. Baked chunks of seasoned potatoes with sausage and mozzarella. . . All desserts are wonderful, great coffees and homemade creamy lemoncello.  . . Notes: Sunday brunch is offered with a slightly different menu. They also serve chorizo that is remarkable! They serve a pizza much like the Salsiccia con potate with pesto & onions.  Sounds strange but it's delicious! . . Homemade pastas served only 2 nights a week. Check their website. Currently it's Wed & Thurs. . . Only beer & wine; except at brunch where they offer Bloody Mary's. . . Bon Appetit!
Awesome music , out or inside atmosphere the food and dessert are fabulous ! Yummie. . Waiter give excelent service !
It seemed to take too long for the pizza to come out, but it was good. I liked the atmosphere but the parking situation sucked. I had the nutella crepes for dessert and quite honestly they are a distant second to crackers and company's crepes. Not impressed enough with the overall situation to come back.
this place is awesome. best pizza in town.
