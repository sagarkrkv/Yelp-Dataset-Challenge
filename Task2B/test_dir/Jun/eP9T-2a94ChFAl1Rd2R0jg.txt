What an awesome hotel with a great staff and quite laid back atmosphere. The ambiance of this hotel is second to nun. They have a free shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace witch is great and runs every 15mins. Also, right next to fashion show mall! This hotel doesn't have a casino so you don't have to deal with the loud night life of Vegas and can relax in a 5 star hotel and enjoy life but your steps from or a free shuttle ride away from one. The rooms are very clean, spacious and I would recommend the one bedroom suite. Full kitchen two full bathrooms king bed and pull out sofa. Make sure to book trump if coming to Vegas!
More like a 4.5 stars. (5 for room & 4 overall hotel) Stayed this Friday & Saturday night and got it off hotwire secret deal for $138/night. Our friends also booked a room and paid over $200 booking directly through the site. . . We got a handicap accessible room and we liked our room better. It had more space and flowed better. They had a heavy glass (textured so not see through) door for their main shower and one for the toilet. Also a huge window overlooking the strip by the tub. We had a huge walk thru shower w/seat (can fit several people), no window or glass doors in our main bath. We had a sectional (w/pull out bed) while they had a 2 seater sofa bed. They got 4pm check out and ours at 11am.. . Pros:. - 2 bathrooms (technically 3 showers since there's also a shower in the huge spa tub) . -very comfy beds & clean. Hotel lobby also smelled nice. - bedroom/main bath is enclosed, and separate kitchen/living/2nd bath so we were able to have people drink/hang in our room while kids slept in the other. . -2 big tvs and 1 in bath mirror. -TONS of storage space and space in general. -full size subzero fridge, microwave, stove, oven, dishwasher - basically more than what we needed for a wknd trip. - free shuttle to caesars palace & wynn . -not too crowded, non smoking, no casino (good for us w/toddler). . Cons:. -valet only. Shuttle ends at 12am for cesars and 2am for Wynn on Sat. and 12am other days. -The walk to the strip is doable but ee passed dirt, and no sidewalks some parts and darker emptier at night. Maybe better to cut through the mall during the day. We survived w/2 strollers, but rather not do again. . -no dining options after 10, and since we arrived at 10:30 and just valeted, and nothing  close by, only option was room service. Room service was good but pricey.. ($17 pizza, $13 bacon/eggs/hashbrowns etc)  . -we didn't have a problem with noise, but you can hear the train nearby so may be a problem w/light sleepers. -small pool. . We'd stay here again if we can get a rate under $200. We loved our room, but valet only, no late dining options, and a bit further walk w/stroller is a bit of a hassle with us. We also had to wait for another shuttle since had 2 strollers & couldn't fit
We had such a great experience at the Trump! For the people who are complaining that there isn't a casino - did you do ANY research on the hotel when you booked the place? Hell, even Hotwire lists that it's a resort, not a casino. We really enjoyed not having to walk through the smokey casinos to get to our room. The Trump was immaculate - so clean and smelled so fresh. . . The Saturday we opted for a cabana rental which was so cheap. We paid $150 for the entire day and that included an air conditioned cabana with a fridge full of water and sodas, our own daybed outside of the cabana and a waitress. The staff was really good and we always had a drink in hand. It was well worth the price, especially considering just how expensive other cabana rentals are at other hotels. . . All in all, we think we found a great gem. It's a little off strip, close to the mall and they have a shuttle that can take/pick-up to Wynn and Caesars. I think we will for sure stay here again for the price, the service and the overall experience.
Very nice if it is just the 2 of you.. . The suites do not have more than one bed (the pullout sofa bed does not count).  The pullout bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept on.  You would think that a place with the name Trump on it would invest in more comfortable sofa beds, especially in a city where more than two people usually share a room.  . . They do however try to accommodate you by bringing up extra cushioning for the bed but it does not help, you can still feel the metal bars digging in strange places of your body while trying to lay down. Which therefore makes it impossible to fall asleep, unless you're blackout drunk.. . The rooms however are so nice and the bathrooms are fancy as all get up.  The rooms have kitchenettes (Trump was actually going to make these condo's before turning it into a hotel) and the bathrooms have little TVs.. . The location of the hotel is right after the Wynn and right before old school vegas starts (i.e.  the sahara, fremont street, stratosphere, etc.). In other words, ONE HELL OF A WALK.. . There is no casino here which makes this very classy and less noisy.  The elevators are extremely fast which can make you kind of woozy if you are inebriated.. . PLEASE TRY THE CLUB SANDWICH AT THE POOL CAFE! It is so delicious!!. . Itis one fancy, classy, beautiful hotel.
I love the Trump in Vegas. No Casino. I love that! Quick walk to elevators. No Smoke! Half block to the Strip. Free shuttles to either the Wynn or to Ceasers, every 20 minutes! Rooms are amazing with full kitchens. Bathrooms are amazing with seperate WC, jacuzzi tub and seperate luxurious shower. Only bad thing is that the pool closes much too early. It is a beautiful pool deck with huge pool and two whirlpool spas. Keep it open longer! At leat until 10 PM! But no, it is usually closed by 7 PM. Friendly staff. Happy hour isn't much of a discount but you can't expect cheap drinks from the Donald.
I've stayed here many times and always get the best service here. But this time was the best one so far. Ethel at the front desk was wonderful. It was around 10 in the morning when my boyfriend and i arrived. I was there for a lighting conference and my boyfriend had just flown in from Rome the night before and we were both really tired. In fact we had about 2 1/2 hours of sleep. I was hoping there were rooms available by the time we got there, but none were. Ethel however was able to convince me to upgrade our room. I normally wouldn't have agreed because of all the expenses i knew we would have next few days, but she was very nice and friendly and even have me tips on a few things here and there, like the rewards program and such that i agreed. I don't regret spending the extra money to upgrade. Our one bedroom suite was amazing (I've stayed in one before but never really got to enjoy it since my friends and i went clubbing a lot), but this time my boyfriend and i took advantage of the room and the amenities the hotel offered.. . The valet people were very nice and welcoming, they always remembered who i was. Houskeeping, Lilliana, was great. I think she could tell that my boyfriend and i had a bit of OCD, so when we came back after an afternoon out by the pool, we saw all our toiletries lined up like perfect little soldiers.. . The hotel is not on the strip but isn't far from it. There's no casino, which i prefer and no smoking. It always smells good and the staff is always friendly. I look forward to staying here again.
The Trump is a classy hotel. Not only is it in a good area but it is one of the few hotels on the strip that is smoke free and doesn't have a casino inside which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Although the good thing about this is the whole hotel smells like suntan lotion which is a lot better than smelling cigarette smoke! . . I was offered a great deal with the trump were I had to go to a timeshare meeting so I got a killer deal on a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms are huge! Mine had a king sized bed, pullout sofa bed, living room, kitchen with subzero full sized fridge and freezer, and 2 bathrooms. The master bathroom was enormous and even had double shower heads which I fell in love with and there was also a washer and dryer. The trump also offers shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace but I found it was just easier to take a taxi since every time I tried to use the shuttle it was a long wait. Overall I highly recommend the Trump! I will be coming back in the future.
I live in Las Vegas but if I want to get away from it all I check in to the Trump.  Its elegance, service, location, pool, spa, food and ambiance transports you to a delightful staycation.  You have the Fashion Show Mall across the Street, the Wynn and Encore within walking distance, concierge service, shuttle service, beautiful suites, great room service and a fabulous spa tub in a room with a fridge and hot plate.   There is a train track near so expect some noise and bring your own bubble bath.  On line Trump has specials all the time for discounts at the hotel, spa or upgrades so keep a look out.  No smoke, no slot machines and no bad service.
This was my 2nd and my wife's 1st trip to Vegas. I was a little skeptical after reading some mixed reviews. But, we weren't disappointed -. A True 5 star experience. As soon as you enter the hotel, you know that it's a beautiful place. Our check-in was very smooth (11 pm). Paul at the front desk offered us a complimentary upgrade. I was delighted to know that we got a one bedroom suite. We loved the strip view. The rooms were clean and beautiful. The bathrooms were nice. The beds were comfortable and the best part was the staff.. However, I think they should offer self-park services. I didn't have any issues with the Valet parking, but, sometimes I thought I can use self-park. The TV in the bathroom mirror was great. The LG TVs in the bedroom/family room could use an upgrade.. There are no casinos in the hotel, but We are no big gamblers. We really liked the fact that we didn't have to walk through the casino to go to our room.. We stayed in room 5926 (59th floor), and I loved the experience.. I realize that the hotel is one block off the strip. But, we had a rental car, so we didn't have any issues. Also, the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to Wynn & Cesears Palace every 15 minutes.. overall had a great time, thank you Mr. Trump for such a wonderful experience.
Great location and hotel - just not as perfect as previous visits. . If you want beautiful, spacious room in a smoke free hotel in the northern Strip this is the hotel for you.  I LOVE the location - on the strip but not ON the strip.  The Fashion Show mall is right across the street so all the shops/restaurants of the mall along with the Wynn/Encore, Venetian/Palazzo, Ti and Mirage are all a short (mostly) air conditioned walk away.. . That said...everything was just a little off this time.  I usually visit for a longer than 'normal' stay and in the past when checking in I would get,  'I see you're with us for some time...can I offer you an upgrade' or 'I'm sorry, but we're fully booked over the weekend portion of your stay so this is best room available.'  This time, nothing.  And while the breakfasts are usually uniformly wonderful I had an off breakfast this time - the Eggs Benedict came back hard poached.  And previously when I put the 'housekeeping please' light I've always come back to a cleaned room.  This time I put the light on and left at 9:30 then came back at 3:00...to an unmade room.  At base, nothing horrible...just not the perfection of my previous visits.. . Lastly, if you are travelling with younger guests, you should note that the hotel is no longer allowed to serve breakfast to people under 21 in their restaurant (because there is a small bar in the back). As an alternative, they have set up a 'to go' breakfast station in the lobby (and of course offer room service).
It's a very nice hotel at a affordable price. The rooms are very large, with lots of seating as well as a massive bathroom. The mini kitchen is a great add. It even has a blender! Make sure you buy your own water though because the hotel gives you super tiny bottles. The pool and fitness centre are both quite nice. The shuttle to Caesars was helpful and ran frequently. It ended at 12am though, which made it hard to catch the shuttle after a late show. .   . Some people complained about rude valet and front desk staff, but I found everyone to be really friendly and helpful. The only downside was the train. I was on the 28th floor and the train was still super loud. But who comes to Vegas to sleep right?! . . This is a great hotel for anyone who wants to stay somewhere nice, but not pay nice hotel prices.
Nice place but lacks a casino if that's your thing. Stayed in the two bedroom suite which is basically a studio and one bedroom with a common foyer connecting the two. . . They have a small gym which is actually pretty nice even though it's small. Pool is nothing special just a big rectangular pool. . . Staff has been very friendly and always accommodating. Didn't try the restaurants or room service. . . One complaint is they only have one kids channel. Kids get bored if they're stuck in the room. . . Overall it's a very nice place but don't expect all the ambiance of a casino.
I enjoyed staying at this hotel. It was clean, rooms were spacious. Hotel does not have a casino and this is exactly what I prefer. No smoke smell permeating the building. Staff were helpful. Just be sure not to attempt to sleep on the sleeper sofa. It was so uncomfortable with springs jabbing into you. Requested a room change and received a room with 2 queen beds, which were very comfortable. Also, mandatory valet. No self parking. The hotel entrance is right across the street from the mall. The location is pretty good, even though it's slightly off strip.
My review is more of the 4.5 star variety, but in an effort to be positive on Yelp I am bumping my rating up to five stars!. . My girlfriend and I stayed at the Trump for two weekend nights in June of 2014. We got a pretty good deal through the Priceline name your price feature but on that same token you don't know what hotel you're going to get when you do that, so when we got the Trump I was unsure what to expect. I did my research and saw the same complaints: far from the strip, no casino and bad parking situation. After my stay, I was again reminded how unreasonable certain people can be when writing reviews on Yelp, because our stay was truly fantastic. I can say without a doubt that the Trump is the nicest hotel I've EVER stayed at -- and I've stayed at the Venetian.. . From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. Lots of being addressed as "sir" and lots of smiles. We went to the pool on our first day (the pool was nice -- nothing extravagant like Caesar's Palace or the Venetian) and one of the pool employees asked us if we want to sit in the sun or shade and then set up the chairs with our towels tucked in and even gave us advice to show up early the following day, Saturday, because of how busy it can get. On our last night, I got back from Treasure Island, where I went to play poker, at about 2 a.m. I went to the front desk to ask about the late checkout situation since I knew I'd want to sleep in and the desk employee said "the latest I can do without charge is 2 p.m." Wow! Good luck getting that late of checkout for free at any other high-end Vegas hotel. I also asked if I could get another comforter and one was sent up to my room within 10 minutes. It goes without saying the room was amazing -- the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was amazing in itself (huge shower and bath tub, TV in the mirror) and the kitchenette was cool, though we never really used it, except for the coffee maker (free Starbucks coffee was a very nice touch).. . As for the complaints:. 1.) "It's far from everything" Then you know what? If you're looking to roam the strip for hours at a time on a nightly basis then this place probably isn't for you. My girlfriend and I liked the fact it was off-strip because we're over the strip craziness and it made for a relaxing and quiet stay, while the strip was still close enough for us to easily meet up with our friends staying at Caesar's Palace. On that note, the free shuttle to/from Caesar's was nice (we never used the one to the Wynn), and it runs every 10 minutes or so. The one time we used it it was returning from Caesar's (we decided to take a cab there -- about $10 with tip) and we didn't have to wait for the shuttle to get there and it was a quick ride.. 2.) "But there's no casino!" You're in Vegas -- there are plenty of nearby casinos. Treasure Island was my nearby choice for my one night of gambling, and it was less than a 10-minute drive and under a mile away. I drove, but you could certainly walk or take a cab. Again, it's Vegas...your options are plenty! I personally liked walking in to a hotel that smelled nice and not having to walk through a smokey corridor with degenerate gamblers to get to my room, but maybe that's just me.. *Also, the loud freight train some people have complained about never bothered us, but then again we were on the 49th floor...we were also facing the tracks though, so if we were on a lower floor it might have been a problem, because we could definitely hear the horn at times, though it never woke us. Translation: get a higher room!. . The only reason I'd "downgrade" it half a star is because of the valet only situation. Yes, I knew this after getting assigned the hotel in the Priceline match and, after doing my research, I made sure to have cash on hand at all times for tips. That means that if you plan on taking your car to go out frequently -- and you might have to, given the location -- then be prepared and bring cash. I consider myself a generous tipper and have no problem tipping, especially in a place like Vegas which is so service-oriented. However, having self parking would be a nice option seeing as how pricy doing valet a couple of times a day can be. It almost puts your guests and valet employees in a weird situation, because guests might not always be inclined to tip since they're being "forced" to valet and it's technically part of the resort fee, and in turn the valet employees -- whose livelihood is dependent on those well-deserved tips -- might get upset, and somewhat understandably so. At the end of the day, frequent tipping, even a couple of dollars each time, is MUCH cheaper than taking a cab to/from strip locations. In the three times we picked up the car, I tipped $2, $3 and $4 and never did I feel like I got lesser service because my rental car wasn't fancy or the tip was comprised of singles.. . In summary, I highly recommend the Trump, but do your research and make sure the particulars of the hotel work for you!
Absolutely loved our stay a The Trump... . It is NOT on the Strip.. But..it's across a Nordstrom. And that for me is a total Win.. . It does NOT have a Casino.. . It does NOT have the gross carpet.. . It does NOT have the indoor cigarette smell. In fact.. as you walk into the lobby.. you are taken to a world of SPA smelling heaven. Like really. Whatever that is.. I want it at my home.. . Such a relaxing smell that makes you enjoy your little home away from home awesome.. . They do have a nicely equipped Gym; and a decent sized pool.. . It could be a little bit hard to find space to lay in by the pool; but we always get lucky that we find a spot.. . Loved their pinacoladas. Hated their Chips and Salsa. Like.. awful salsa. Ew.. . The pool only goes up to like 4ft i think so that's not too cute. But i mean.. i think people use the pool just to look cute and not swim; right?. . The bed was heavenly... Customer Service is great.. . They do have a shuttle to the Cesar's Palace and the Wynn I think.... . Loved the marble flooring in the lobby.. . Near the Fashion Mall..
This is my second time staying at Trump. I like the fact that it has no casino and it's a nonsmoking hotel. A major plus was the courtesy shuttle to and from The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and Wynn Las Vegas. The hotel is not on the strip, but strip adjacent. It is across Fashion Show Mall. . . We booked two rooms and it was convenient that they were connected by a small foyer. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious, with a spa tub. You don't even have to go to the pool. There's also a TV in the mirror and a phone next to the toilet. Perhaps it's for someone who runs out of toilet paper?
This was my first time staying at this hotel & it will definitely NOT be my last. This place is absolutely amazing!!!! It was our home for 3nights. There is no self parking just valet which is great cause it's free. The staff is very welcoming & helpful. When u step foot inside, you smell like you're inside a spa. There is no casino inside so u don't smell the smoke. Complimentary bell service. The room was spectacular!!! Definitely a fancy stay. The bathroom was huge. His & hers sinks. Jacuzzi tub. TV in the mirror. Big shower. The bed was super comfy. There's a kitchen. Came equipped with cookware & silverware. Room service was really quick as well. The pool was great as well. Not the usually crowded rowdy group. Ideal for families too. Oh! Complimentary water & Starbucks coffee/tea.
I stayed at the Trump International this past weekend. The hotel is very nice and most of the staff was wonderful. Rooms were beautiful everything was clean and fresh. A little further from the strip then I thought it was but they have shuttles and it's an easy walk to get to Wynn or Encore.  So the reason for only 3 stars:  . 1. No outside food or drink at the pool. Well I can understand the policy, I don't have to like it. For one, last year I stayed at the mirage and they had no issues with this.  Second, one morning I saw two girls with McDonalds cups at the pool while I was at the gym. . 2. The dryer in the bathroom didn't go to high.  It was either medium or low. I don't know if that was just mine because luckily one friend brought her own, so I didn't bother to call the front desk about it. . 3. This one is kinda scary.  I ordered a drink while at the pool Sunday afternoon.  When I was almost done I notice something sliver in the drink. To my amazement, it was a staple.  I'm still trying to figure out how it would even get in my drink. I didn't see my waitress so I took to the employees passing out towels. They were very apologetic and the girl took my drink to the bar manager.  She came back and told me that they were very sorry and that they were making me a new drink and comping my drink from our bill. She assured me the waitress would be out with my drink soon. I didn't want to make a big fuss because I'm in the travel industry and I know things happen. But i could have been hurt if I accidentally swallowed that staple and, to top it off, it took forever to get the new drink. Seriously, I thought I was pretty nice not making a bigger deal but to take forever to bring me a new one just kind of annoyed me.
This is another great hotel that is smoke free & away from casino crowd! Everything in the hotel is Golden!! Which makes you feel like a million bucks ~ if only I have a million dollars! Enjoyed the room & and the room service. Staff are all really friendly and helpful!
Overall The Trump is a very nice hotel. They don't have a casino so it's great for us nonsmokers who don't want to walk through a cloud of smoke to get to our rooms.. . The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The king size beds are very comfortable. I loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the jacuzzi tub. The bathrooms also have a separate shower and toilet.. . Room service is polite and efficient. And to is guests services; having lost our room key several times, they were very nice about bringing one up or making us a new one.  . . My one complaint about The Trump is that cell phone reception is nonexistent! There were 6 of us on 2 different floors and all different networks and no one had reception. I don't know how this is possible in 2014. That's the only reason we won't be returning to this hotel.
Trump hotel didn't disappoint. We were greeted with kind employees and that continued all week. The room was very nice, clean and spacious. Shower was huge. . . I dropped 1 star because of the uncomfortable pillows and the train whistle early morning but neither took away from the experience. . . Pool was nice but get there early for a lounge chair. . . Did not try the restaurants but did try the muffins and fruit at the coffee stand and they were great. . . We didn't mind the lack of casino as this led to a much quieter and smoke free lobby. I would surely return.
