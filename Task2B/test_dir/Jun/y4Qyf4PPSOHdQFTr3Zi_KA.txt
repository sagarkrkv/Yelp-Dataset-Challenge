Nice pools.  Buffet is very affordable and high in quality.   The location is what lost it a star.  Far from the strip, near red rock hiking.  But, if you came to vegas to hike you really don't know how to hike.  The many pools here make this place rock.  It was sad that pool closed at 3pm on Saturday due to a concert and normally closes at 6pm. Also sad, no late check out. Gone by 11a.
There is a few things to like and a lot to hate about this place. . . Good:. -Movie theater is nice, easy to get to, and has self-service kiosks.. -Bowling alley is nice, large, and there is a bar that serves quick drinks.. -The casino itself is probably one of the cleanest and nicest looking casino so far in Summerlin.. -Nice pools.. . Bad:. -Terrible, terrible, terrible public relations. If you could get away without ever having to interact with any of the employees, you will be far better off. . -The general attitude here is "if you don't like it, leave." They are not hurting for business, and have no interest in keeping yours.. -I have spent a fair amount of time gambling at Red Rocks, Rampart, and Suncoast. Of the three, Red Rocks was by far the worst (pay out wise). At first I chalked this up to coincidence, but after 2-3 years the results are always the same. I don't gamble here any more. . . Finally, when I got married last year, we reserved a block of rooms here for our guests, since it was the nicest looking Casino near the wedding venue. Big mistake. The whole thing was a huge headache, with them being rude to our guests and constantly adding "fees" that they had forgotten to tell us about before. If you are getting married out in Summerlin, I highly, highly, highly recommend you look else where for a place for your guests to stay.. . To sum it all up: they act like you should feel lucky to be there and not that they should be lucky to have your patronage.
I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately my check-in experience left me very disappointed and pretty much skewed my whole impression of the place towards the negative side.  Mercedes helped us and was pretty unfriendly, unprofessional and incompetent.  My family and I were here for a wedding and had reserved two rooms with two queen beds which I had specified needed to be next to each other.  These reservations were pre-paid and supposed to be guaranteed but it turned out that they "ran out of double rooms" which was a big disappointment and very inconvenient but would've been easier to accept had Mercedes been more apologetic - she proceeded to try and say that I did not in fact reserve a double (said with attitude), so I had to show her my printed out reservation which clearly said "two double queens" and then when she realized she was in the wrong, gave a bit more of the attitude! On top of that, she could not put our rooms nearby- in fact they were 20 rooms apart!!Unbelievable!! Totally inconvenient since I was traveling with two young children and two elderly grandparents.  To make a long story short, the front desk is really where the first impression is made.  When you have incompetent, unprofessional people working there, it just makes the whole establishment look really bad! The service throughout the rest of the resort was hit or miss and always slow: you either got someone really helpful (the bellboy) or a complete idiot (waitress at the pool), there's no consistency or high standard for great service here.  The room itself was nice and spacious, however not ideal when traveling with kids: no locks on bathroom door, mini bar and snack bar that's very easily accessible to kids (you get charged for just picking something up) and no kids' channels on TV.  The casino wasn't very impressive- no one was really hitting anything, there's not a great variety of machines, and good luck trying to get a drink! I could go on and on about all of my disappointments but lets just say that I will not be going back here.  I'm giving two stars for the few individuals that actually were trying to do their job well.
AmazinglyBeautiful, but the pool girls who automatically get 18% gratuity, suck a** when it comes to service....
I am a regular; not a big gambler here, but I like the Military Monday promotion.  I also like the movie joint, the bowling alley, and the restaurants.  There is also a nice spa attached and a night club, and a pool.  The pool is nice!. . Parking has never been an issue.  Inside secret, go to east lot/garage and not west.  East always easy to park, west almost always hard.. . Great locals place with lots to do.
Can I say amazing customer service?!?!  I am soooooo impressed that Jason remember us from over a year ago.   I love great customer service!!! That is always a plus on my list!  Brad is off to a great start too!  Stay tuned... It's only 130pm more details to follow!!!!!  Thank you for cabana service.
We visited Red Rock Casino and stayed Sunday June 1st through Wed June 4th.  The trip was booked as part of a Southwest Airlines Vacation package. The price for two with airfare and room was 1K total.  We rented a car at the airport and had an easy drive to Red Rocks on 215.  We went to the hotel entrance at the back of the property to the east- where they have valet. . . Karen checked us in at registration. We requested a smoking room ( along with another couple traveling with us) they did not have two rooms for smoking but offered to move us the next day when a room opened up.  The smoking rooms are limited and on the 19th floor only- at the far end of the building.  Since the primary elevator is on the east end on the hotel building it is a longer walk to the rooms.  If you do not have a smoking preference try to ask for a room near the elevator. We asked for a room with the red rocks/ pool view. It was nice.  The other side has views of the strip which were pretty at night- so you can not go wrong with either choice- but ask for a higher floor. . . To access an elevator you use your room key and then press the up button. Nice safety feature. . . The rooms are beautiful and clean. A variety of pillows- hard and soft. Very deep tub and nice walk in shower. There is a scale and hair dryer in the room too.  Each room has a door bell! Inside the room you can press a button to signal of maid service or a do not disturb that displays on the outside door bell.  We did not use or disturb the snack bar contents or refrigerator so no extra charges.  We packed a folding cooler and brought in some pop and liquor in our suit case that we bought at a store before going to the hotel. They do not permit outside beverages coolers or cases to be brought in.  There is an ice machine room about in the middle of the hotel on each floor.  The safe in the closet was easy to use and convenient to store valuables and cash.  . . There is a pool only elevator about half way in the middle of each floor. It goes down to an entry to the pool area. At the pool area there is an attendant that asks for your room key and swipes the card to insure you are a guest.  You can also access the pool through doors from the main elevator on the east side and from doors along the edge of the casino and food court.  Food and beverage ( except their Starbucks drinks) can not be brought to the pool area.  Note- a faster way to get to the end rooms during pool hours is to cut across the pool and take the pool elevator to your floor.  The pool closed at 6pm. We went down one day and found shaded areas on the east side before the sun came over. It did not get too hot until after the sun came full over the building.  We bought some beverages at the Sandbar.  The server told us the gratuity was added to the charge. A virgin pina colada was  only $6 and very yummy. As it was mid week not a lot of families at the pool. . . We at several times at the food court. Easy and inexpensive. Rubios has excellent fish tacos and enchilada dinners. Fat burger rocked- wonderful burgers!  Ate at Panda express- always decent. Villa Pizza was just so so- pizza and calzone bland. Aunt Annies pretzels has pretzel dogs.  We also ate at Feast buffet for breakfast (6.99 with players card) and Lunch (8.99 with players card).  Great value, selection and quality! The breakfast was outstanding- so much variety. Hint- walk the entire buffet including the center salad area before deciding what to eat.  You will be glad you did ! they even had cream of wheat grits and oatmeal!! Hot and fresh- made to order omelets- lunch had carved ham, turkey, pork- bbq chicken- lots of international choices and save room for a piece of pie or the toffee pudding. Outstanding!  There is a special line for hotel guests so the wait for the buffet is much less than for the walk in quests. We did not have time to visit the other restaurants but they looked very nice.  We did not visit the theater or bowling center but they looked very nice and were busy.  . Gambling- they had all but my favorite game Let it Ride. Sort of a bummer. We played $5 Mississippi Stud. Several slots- Kitty Glitter- electronic craps and event did a round of bingo on the Oh so easy to use electronic machine. you buy your cards / package at the bingo sales counter- get a machine- enter your receipt number and walla- All your cards and marked automatically as you play with the best cards showing in the screen. When one number from a win it beeps and if you win it chimes a song ( but you still must yell bingo and raise your hand). Plus two free drinks are included from the bar area for each session.  We had a blast trying this and you can play for an hour for a $20 spot- more if you like!. . Service was efficient and friendly- The resort has a nice vibe- open- clean- classy.  Yes- it is off the strip but only about 20 minute drive away. A wonderful place for families and couples- not a party spot. We will be back!!!
Yelper Travis V is correct, this hotel has poor public relations. I booked 4 rooms for my family and extended family. Two of these rooms were the suites. 1 star for customer service and 4 stars for all the amenities you can do here.. . I phoned twice ahead of time to get rooms on the same floor. we arrived at 2pm our rooms were not ready until a few minutes before 6pm! Also we were not given keys to the pool when we arrived and waited 2.5 hrs and only 1 of 4 rooms was available. . . One of the rooms that was ready had a broken shower spigot. Then another room came avail so half of us moved to that room which their shower drain smelled like a sewer and had to be unclogged.. . When our suites were finally ready at nearly 6pm the room smelled bad. My 1 yr old & 5 yr old grand kids opened the master room drawers and found condoms and the table tops were all dirty which we didn't want to touch anything. I immediately called and asked for a front desk manager. A lady (forgot her name) answered and I explained what happened, yet she wasn't apologetic and I told her to send someone up to dispose of it and re clean the room. Granted by this time we had moved rooms twice already and we were all exhausted. . . Housekeeping manager Miguel (who seemed pleasant) and another lady came to remove the items & said they would get back to me on room change but never did. It was about 6:30pm by the time we unpacked 4.5 hrs after arrival! . . Another manager named Deno was very pleasant and made things right on our bill. Besides all the bad luck we had at this hotel it has a great bowling alley, movies, restaurants, and a great kid friendly lagoon style pool area. This place has it all and you don't even have to leave the area. However, bad track record for customer service.
Staff at the sports bar provide an excellent service.
Great place to be...very friendly staff. Always have something to do from gambling, dining and even watching the latest movie. Got to check out the pool during the warmer it's wonderful and the bowling alley worth checking out. I would bring my friends and family here in the future.
I never actually stayed here overnight but came visit others who had rooms. I was here last year for my brother and his wife's wedding. My parents, brother's and several others were staying at the Red Rock Casino. I was pleasantly pleased with this hotel! This hotel tops off many of the bigger hotels on the strip. It was clean, modern, and up to date. The interior decoration has a very clean look. I went in the next day to the bridal suite and it was much bigger and spacious. They had some pretty nice restaurants also. I would definitely recommend staying here if you drop in at Vegas. it might not be near the strip but it's worth the price, sleeping in a lofty and comfortable hotel!
Decent hotel, but worst check out experience in a long time. Prime time and you only have two people at the desk. Seems a little absurd. In room check out not working = fail.
There is a definite problem with the hospitality  staff.  I'd say 20% of them are great the other 80% don't give a crap.. . The Casino is a bit cheesy and cookie cutter.. . The rooms are decorated and designed nicely but the bones of the structure are poor.  Heavy doors which slam shut, two feet away from each other.  When your neighbor comes home at 3am, your door will rattle as well and wake you up.  The hotel check in area was also difficult to find.
Years ago I booked a room here at the Red Rock and I had a great night.  One that I have never forgot.  Red Rock definately added to the experience and I wouldn't hesitate to book another night there.. . The resort is located in the Sumerlin area and so you're not going to get the riff raff that the strip has.  Sumerlin is where Sun City is and that where a lot of well to do retirees live.  Now if you're looking for action, then yeah...  It's out of the way and you'll be disappointed it's so far away from the strip (about a 20 minute drive away).  However, the drive to the strip isn't grueling.
My favorite local casino. Hands down. . . So much to say!. Movie theatre, check! . Yard house Restuarant, check!. Some bars,check. Salon, awesome!  Love Michael Scott!!. Pool, beautiful... Although you have to be a guest to go..  Boo. Concerts, Sand bar, awesome!!. Then steak house, T Bone Streak, fantastic!!. . Love this place. Another reason I don't leave Summerlin!
Based just on the movie theater ... I love this theater. So clean and spacious. Great seating.  Will def be comming here more often
Beautiful Casino. I haven't stayed at the Hotel, though I have heard from those who have that it's gorgeous. . . The Casino is spacious, has many many many good games and good table games, with friendly dealers. Good Bingo room, brightly lit, well attended. . . The Buffet is EXCELLENT with well prepared, good food, and good variety, also. . . A Five out of Five from me!
This was my second stay out at the Red Rock and for those looking for something off strip, you cannot go wrong here. The rooms are comfortable and I absolutely LOVE the huge soaking tub with TV. If possible, ask for a Red Rock view room and be sure to spend an hour out at Red Rock one morning.
First things first: do not stay here if the strip is where you desire. Yes, they shuttleyou there and its not far, but this place was made to be a resort you don't have to leave. And man, I had no problem there. Having been to Vegas before, this was by far the best place to stay at. The resort is gorgeous; the pools are beautiful, the restaurants are amazing, and the place glitters like Emerald City. Sure, the bars close a little early during the week, but there are so many activities to do and places to eat and congregate, a week there was not enough. Come here to get Vegas, but relaxation too. You will not regret it. It is pricey, but see below! LIVING SOCIAL gave me an amazing deal, please look into it!
1 star for clean rooms and a pretty resort. Unfortunately, that's where it stops. Staff is unaccommodating.  Due to an emergency, I needed to check out 24 hours early. Their policy is, a three day notice prior to cancellation. My entire stay was 3 days, there was no way of knowing that I would need to check out early, therefor I was charged for a day that I was not there. This was not a week end day!  They are understaffed, my wait to check in on a Monday, was 35 minutes with only 4 people in front of me. The other issue was, I called the concierge for much needed info, I was left on hold for 10 min each time on two attempts. The 3rd attempt I was told she would call back....she did not. There are plenty of casinos that treat their guests well...this is NOT one of them.
When visiting Vegas, I always like to spend a little time off strip. Catch up with old friends who still live in Vegas and catch the last rays of sun before I have to hop on a plane to head back home.. . What I like about Red Rock is the down time I get to enjoy. I spent most of my time by the pool. Sometime at the bowling alley, a little time playing Bingo and considered going to a movie, but we had an early flight and headed to bed. There is no lack of things to do and it is one of the few places I think it would be alright to bring kids. . . Played some poker here too, it's a very local scene, so players know each other pretty well, so the game can run very loose aggressive and showdowns often involved one weak ace vs another. Hmph. . . The hotel is very clean, the rooms are nice and modern with a great view of the pools if you go for an even number room. Super comfortable beds, a nice oversized bathtub with a small TV for keeping up on soccer matches. :)
love the place
Great stay and amenities.  Biggest annoyance was long lines for check in and if you wanted to check out and get a print out long lines.  Hire people that will expedite exit and entrance would be my only comment...then it would have been a perfect stay.
I was very disappointed by the poor customer service when checking into the casino. Having purchased a Groupon promotion that was supposed to include a $50 resort credit, I was denied the $50 resort credit even though I read the terms and fine print to the manager which had no minimum stay requirements. Don't purchase this Groupon if you are expecting a $50 resort credit. The registration desk manager obviously doesn't believe in customer satisfaction.
STEGGS AT RED ROCK CASINO & HOTEL.. . Steggs = steak and eggs. It's seriously the best place to get a medium-rare steak or country fried chicken with a side of crispy hash browns and toast for a price of $6. The portions are huge and they cook their dishes to perfection. . . BTW they make their own strawberry jelly! That's right, they give it out with your toast in a small little jar. So cute.. . It's a great get together for large groups, because their steak and egg menu is at night so there is NO WAIT. . . I'm always here with my buddies during summer. You know we're just a bunch of broke college students getting hungry in the middle of the night.. . The only catch is AT LEAST one of your friends MUST have a rewards gambling card to get accessed to the steggs menu. You get the rewards card for free and you don't have to gamble. If you show that your table has one rewards card, then your whole table gets the cheap menu.
Stayed here for one night. As a local we have never stayed at a local hotel. The opportunity came up for a free room so we did it. We would absolutely do it again!  This hotel was perfect. The room was amazing (16111)!  Great view, clean, great amenities and a fully stocked refrigerator. The pool was great and the restaurants were great too. Couldn't have been happier.
Always have been happy with red rock until this time. I don't think they are used to having large groups of people or being fully booked. Although I have been here for seminar and it was a very good experience then. This time I had to line up 3 - 4 times at the front desk to check if our room is ready despite fact that they already sent a text it is. On top of that the lady front desk who was just being helpful was reprimanded by Juan, male front desk for being helpful.. . Anyways 3 long lines and 4 1/2 hours later - we got our room. Not even as little as "sorry for the inconvenience". Too bad I always enjoyed red rock and just one incident/person will turn it completely around!
This was a great place to stay....I am happy we upgraded our room....It was beautiful and well worth it.....Loved being able to see a chick flick because the movie theater is on site.....Gaming area was clean and the dealers were nice......The pool was huge and beautiful.......We will be back
Our stay was 5 nights in June 2014. My rating is a 'soft' 4 stars. Overall our stay was a good one. We travel to Las Vegas often and have grown tired of the chaotic tourist trap of the strip. So off the strip we go....I liked the far more mellow tempo of RRR.  We had a rental car ( you're crazy if you stay here without one) so visiting the strip or downtown was quite easy. Valet service here is top notch and very appreciated! I like the casino very much with its current and varied slot choices...and for me they were loose and fun! The food choices as well are varied and good..from food court to high end choices.  I personally liked the Grand Cafe and found it priced right and good service. The room we were kindly upgraded to was stylish and had a good view of the canyon. It was mostly clean with minor missed areas and the housekeeping came early each day. Always tip your housekeepers...they earn it. The bathroom was very nice with robes and soaking tub. One complaint or warning I would pass on is the incredible distance from the elevators to the last rooms down the hall...literally the longest hall I've ever experienced. .so ask at check in where your room is in relation to the elevators! The other minor but worth mentioning concern was the abundance of children at the pool...we simply are not that kid friendly and found all the screaming and splashing to be a bit much...but also understand they have a right to a good time. Food and drinks at the pool were good and above average. Staff throughout were helpful though perhaps some, just some, of the waitresses at the pool were pretty much more concerned about their looks than with quality service.  Overall a good experience staying here and yes we would recommend RRR to those looking for an off strip change of pace.
