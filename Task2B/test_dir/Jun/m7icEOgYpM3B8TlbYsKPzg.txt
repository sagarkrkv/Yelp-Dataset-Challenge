I thought this show was OK. Have seen a lot of better shows. The comedy was pretty funny, but I almost felt like it was a mishmosh of stuff put together. At least I could say I saw it.
Extraordinary! In true Vegas fashion, this adult show offered something appealing to everyone. It included exciting, sexy, powerful, and seductive performances, even tossing in a comedic spin & interacting with audience members. Loved it!
Of all the Soleil shows I've seen, Zumanity is my favorite.  It's definitely a "date" show and I wouldn't go with family, for sure.  It's the most crowd-interactive of the Soleil show's I've seen and the balance between dance and acrobatics is good.  It's not as mind blowing as other Soleil shows but overall, it's worth going too for a great time, a good laugh, and to kick off the Vegas mood.
This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and it was great....there wasn't much of a story line but other then that I was thoroughly entertained. The performers were fantastic! All of the characters had so much pizzazz . I went to school for theater so I really, really, enjoyed every aspect of the show. The nudity was nothing wild, it was fitting. It was funny, laid back, fun and I LOVED when theybrought people from the audience out on stage. It was so liberating and free, GREAT show!
Excellent show that is not for kids or childish people.  If you don't have an open mind or shy away from nudity then you will not like this show because it is a burlesque show.  Enough said.
Great show! This was our first cirque du soleil show and we felt it was unique and entertaining. Yes it was risque and yes they probly went a bit too far a time or two, but it's a show. It's supposed to illicit feelings and entice people to imagine =) . . Overall we had fun and it actually encouraged us to watch 3 more cirque shows (and counting).
Well, the wife thought it would be a good show, and for the most part it was.  We had seen the Cirque du Soleil Beetles Love the night before, so we were disappointed in the amount of acrobatics that were in this show.  Just a lot of nudity and sexual innuendo stuff.
I had been told to stay away from the Zummanity show multiple times.  Generally, people tell me that it's full of lame humor and light sexual innuendo only exciting to 19 year old Mormons.  . . I didn't find this to be the case at all.  The show was terrifically funny; and like any Cirque show, it was a feast for the eyes.  The reason I like this show so much, and recommend it, is because it's exactly what I wanted it to be.  I wasn't looking for a strip show (Vegas has plenty of those).  I was looking for a celebration of the human body as a form of art with mild sexual undertones.  Imagine seeing those sculpted Cirque performers going through amazing feats of acrobatics, only more beautifully than ever (and basically naked).  It was a wonderful, classy, and adult experience.  . . Don't forget to get 30% off with them M-Life card, and also I recommend sitting up close and center.
It was an interesting show... I think i should have seen it before Absinthe, i had higher hopes. I expected more acrobatics, almost none. There were some parts that were very funny and some acts that were filler and could be replaced by something else.. . Save your money, see something else.
I'm sure many people are going to be completely blown away by how "sexy" and "sensual" this show is, but in my opinion the acts were very hit or miss... mostly miss.. . My date and I came to conclusion that this show is tailor-made for middle aged couples who are trying to reignite some spark they lost while they're in Vegas by going to the "sexiest" (and cheapest) Cirque show in Vegas. This theory was supported by a couple of acts we witnessed. One in particular, featured about 6 muscle men trying to watch "the game" on an old big screen while a woman dances and writhes on top of and in front of the TV to get their attention. It was kinda of disgusting. Yes, a reality for probably a lot of people (heeeyy middle aged couples who lost their spark), but can't we move past this and elevate the show to something better than a sexist stereotype about men vs women? . . Other acts were alright but I couldn't help but laugh over the narration and weird background white noise music of orcas mating and women with a European accents whispering "sssssenssssual". . The comedy acts were great, probably because they weren't taking themselves too seriously (and "sensually") at that point. The one act I appreciated was the rope aerialist (but the overdubbed moaning was a bit much). . Overall I would recommend other Cirque shows and other variety shows over Zumanity, but if you are unfamilar with erotic movies or theater, blush when someone says arreola, and your one desire while in Vegas is to ignite that lost spark with your spouse while saving some money and seeing topless women in an "artful" way then.... proceed.
This show is just what it says it is Risque!! It's not your typical cirque show either!! It was great. We laughed and laughed. As usual there is more than one thing happening on stage and you want to catch it all. They include audience members which was absolutely a hoot!! There is not a bad seat in the house either. Do not feel pressured to by your tickets at the box office. You can get them for half the price on line. This is NOT a show for children or people whom are offended by sexual content. We both thoroughly enjoyed the show and I would go again!!
it was sexy.  it was funny.  it was a good time.
Went with a pair of out of town friends on the locals discount night, and had a blast. In brief; The show's fun.. . It's sort of a cabaret style show, with a lot of different small acts tied together with a thread of "hehe, aren't boobies fun." Every segment definitely won't be 'sexy', for everyone, but I think it hits a pretty nice "medium". There's plenty for whom it would be way beyond risque, but my group found it tame but visually stunning. It more "eludes to sex" than emphasizes it, which is what I would expect from an artistic circusy interpretation of that. They also make an effort to elude to kinks and quirks of all different flavors, but all with the same "rating". So they evoke BDSM and schoolgirl fantasies in equal measure to...different(?) results. Our friends were shocked (!) to find out the host was a cross dresser, for example, and my husband and I were more amused at his discomfort than we'd been shocked by anything in the show.. . As with a lot of extremely low yelp reviews, I tend to see the low reviews of this show following a "We did not understand what we were walking into, so our expectations were WAY off." . It was about what I expected; a pretty classically art-house allusion to the good the bad and the absurd about what happens when humans sex. If you go expecting porn, or serious theater or a wacky madcap rom-com...you're gonna be disappointed.. . Pros:. - Gorgeous acrobatics, some very cool acts, and some visuals that have just stuck in my brain like skull-geckos.. - Fun night, if you're a fan of cabaret style shows, and ready to laugh at taboos. Some acts will intrigue, some will make you laugh, some will probably turn you on at least a little, and some will just be boring or unmemorable or possibly scandalous depending on your crowd. . - Find out if your friends are racists or prudes! Guaranteed conversation starter! Or ender. Forever.. . Cons: . - A bit spendy, even at the locals price.. - If you're not a fan of cabaret style shows, and want to love the whole thing, do not waste your money, you'll have favorites and less favorite skits. . - Definitely not the most "over the top" of the Cirque shows; it's smaller, shorter, and again, a cabaret. If you want lots of flying and leaping and stuff, go to Ka. Want music and dancing and choreography, hit up Love. Want to laugh and let your dinner settle, talk about the show over drinks, and then shag when you get home? Bingo. Know what you're getting into.
