Me and my friend had seen this place on Yelp and had decided to go for dinner. When we got there it was very busy, but we waited less than 10 minutes and got a seat at the bar. We got the all you can eat and the service was very efficient and fast (espically for how busy they were). Our server was very sweet and funny and kept our waters refilled continuously. She even recommended us a great appetizer (the seafood salad is a must if you like raw fish). The sushi rolls were fantastic and tasted fresh. For the price that you pay for the all you can eat on top of the service we received and the quality of the sushi, this place was fantastic.
Hands down my favorite AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. I have to go here at least once a month. Dinner is something like $25 to $26 dollars but includes everything on the menu, including appetizers. There are a few things you can only get one order of however. . . One of those things is the "seafood salad" which is a must have. If you like Sashimi, you will like the seafood salad. Don't let the term salad scare you. It is literally just a plate piled high with different types of raw fish covered in either a spicy or a creamy sauce. No vegetables to be seen. I also recommend the "no name roll.". . Overall the quality of the sushi is pretty good. This is a place I would go and order food A la carte. The fact that it is all you can eat is incredible. If you haven't been here and like sushi, do yourself a favor and try it out.. . My only two complaints are long wait times (it is a medium size restaurant, so popular times are usually pretty packed) and drunk homeless people (it is located in kind of a sketchy strip mall, so if you are outside waiting for your table be prepared to be accosted by people begging for money or drunks mumbling to themselves).
This place was pleasant, service was fast, and unlimited sushi. Super awesome good stuff!!!!
If I could give this place more than just five stars I would. I don't live in Vegas but every time I'm in town this place is a must and I don't mean on just one day/night. I mean on a couple, if not several times while in town. Stop searching for a good sushi spot and go to Yama! Off the charts amazing. AYCE top notch sushi for $22! Not a limited menu either, their ENTIRE menu is offered- apps, sushi, sashimi, dessert! Oh, except for your drink of choice... Unless you like water from Lake Mead w/ a side of lemon if you're feeling fancy, then that is free. . . Some inside info & tips: . -They do not take reservations and the secret is out for this gem, so expect a long wait. . - After the waitress thinks you've had enough food, you'll notice she'll start to disappear.. Just learn her name and then she'll have to respond! . - Make sure you double check your bill. On a couple of occasions my bill has been incorrect. . - This place is VERY small and kinda crammed- Not very good for kids. . - You cannot go wrong for any of their specialty rolls- all are amazing!! . - DON'T leave without trying the Seafood Salad!!!!!!!!
Being from Hawaii I know my sushi...and this was great sushi.  Not only was everything fresh but I couldn't believe the price.  This was all you can eat sushi for under $30...more like closer to $25.  There is no way that you would be able to find this kind of quality of fish in Hawaii for all you can eat for this price.  It's not only sushi that's on the all you can eat menu, they have edamame, chicken, beef, tonkatsu, tempura, SASHIMI. Say what?  All you can eat sashimi?  No way! . . Of course you can also order off of their regular dinner menu also which is very reasonable.  . . If we lived in Vegas I would be going there every month.  If you are a vegas local, I would highly suggest you try this place at least once.  It's a great place for all types of groups, families, couples.  Parking...free and plenty of it.
This is a gem of the place if you're like me and you hate going to begas for business.  . . A very short cab ride from the strip, away from the glitz and over produced everything in a little mall is a pack sushi place with an all you can eat menu (don't order too much, it'll cost extra) . . In short, this place is excellent.  The fact that it is very affordable with a wonderful selection is just an added bonus.  We'd been tipped off to this place by a cab driver and that was the best thing about my week long stay.
This place is pretty incredible. I may have come in at 3 pm on a Wednesday, but the wait was less than 2 minutes and the wait on my food was also amazingly short. Almost all of the fish was terrific (shout out to the salmon). The only mediocre food I received was the albacore sushi and even that wasn't bad. The staff was ATTENTIVE and checked back often to take away our used dishes. Whenever we asked for something (ponzu sauce, more water, more food, etc) it arrived quickly. The only complaint I have was that sometimes good we didn't order arrived at our table instead of the table that ordered it. Luckily we all had the all you can eat so it didn't matter much. Overall, pretty fantastic.
This is my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. Quick turnover rate. Good selection of sushi and non-sushi items. No real time limit. I almost always order the sashimi salad and short ribs. You can also have the salad with the sauce on the side. My friends do that in order to keep the sauce for dipping other sushi in. Personally, I just like being the one to decide how much sauce I want in my salad. I've been here a handful of times already, and I'll likely continue going.
This has got to be my favorite sushi place yet!  Coming from Cali, this place is a must whenever we're in town.  The first time I came here was summer '11 & things haven't changed one bit!. . This past weekend, my bf and I arrived from a long drive and decided to start our trip off with some delicious sushi.  Although we love to eat, our tummies cannot take that much food... but this time we decided other wise.. . Lunch buffet for $20/each -- best choice we made this whole trip!. . The rolls we decided to order this time were:  spicy sexy roll (we LOVE spicy foods and this roll in particular will leave your mouth on fiyah!!), you the man too!!, snow in vegas (this one was ehh... the sauce was too sweet for our tastebuds), strip tease (super yummy), Philadelphia roll (x2) and a salmon skin hand-roll.  I also got two orders of miso soup for myself & he got an order of muscles and gyoza.. . The food here is amazing & service is pretty good as well.  Can't wait to go back!
The absolute best sushi place in Las Vegas. From food quality to service and ambiance they have it all. Order the seafood salad spicy, you won't regret it.
We saw this sushi place on yelp while we were visting las vegas this past weekend and thought we would try it since it had great reviews and we were looking for some great sushi without the high dollar price!. Let me tell you when we found tjis place it looked very uninviting from the outside but once we got it .it was soo packed and noticed lots of business men inside eating so that validated us to stay.. We ordered AYCE for a fair price of 24 dollars and you can choose anything on menu including desert.. Every roll we tried was delicious and very fresh!. We sat at sushi bar and service was good .We will always stop here for sushi when we visit vegas its a must!. Highly recommend just get there early or you will be waiting for awhle.
Great price for fresh sushi. We sat the sushi bar and the service was awesome. It was $25 per person for all you can eat for 2 hours. You can order anything on the menu! Yum
Absolutely the best ever. I wish I could go back. Their spicy salad is awesome and their number seven rocks. Always look forward to going back. Last time I was there I got stuffed. They need to open a restaurant in Phoenix. I would be a huge support.
This place is awesome.  The all-you-can eat seems like a great deal, but I honestly haven't done the math.  The ability to pick and choose whatever roll you want and to constantly have food being brought out to you is nice, however.  Furthermore, the quality of the sushi here is better than anything in Chinatown (obviously), and tastier than pretty much everything in the city.  My one word of advice is this, try the white tuna roll.  Personally, I don't love tuna, so I was skeptical at first.  My friends kept telling me how incredible it was, so I decided to give it a try. Wow.  It is unlike anything I've ever eaten before, and just the thought of it makes my mouth water.  Also, try the No Name and Son of a Beach rolls.  They're the best! Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
This spot is a must do when I visit Vegas. The all you can eat option is inexpensive compared to other all you can eat sushi spots I've frequented. . . The seafood salad is available once per person and is delicious. The nigiri is fresh and the portions are large. The rolls are also tasty and fresh and the variety is awesome. . . Things to keep in mind... It's about a $15-$20 cab ride from the Strip depending where you're coming from. Also, the wait here can be ridiculous, although the line does tend to move quickly.
Great service, great food! I come here often and have never been disappointed. They have a good variety of specialty rolls and good quality for an all you can eat spot.
This is the spot for sushi while you're in vegas! Place is always packed and the service is FAST no matter what you order. . . AYCE is under $30 and open the whole menu, not just sushi. The only downside is it could take a while to get seated when it's the dinner hour, but it's well worth the wait!
My Favorite Sushi Place in Las Vegas!!!... I go here any chance I get, I live on the opposite side of town,  but it is definitely worth the trip!!... they're always busy, so prep for a lil wait!!!... but if you like sushi it's worth the wait!!!...
This is my eastside Vegas sushi pick.  Mainly if I just need a quick uni fix.  It's a bit tight quartered inside and sometimes there can be a wait to get seated because of it.  Decent, polite staff and quality sushi.  The price is moderate.  AYCE is fair and the "mandatory AYCE rice-fill" is not as aggressive as most other All you can eat joints.  Avid sushi goers know what I'm talking about.. . Recommended. -Hamachi. -Uni. -Yellow tail. . Not impressed. -dynamite. -soft shell. . Good spot for sushi lunch.
So today I went here and eat  the food was ok. :\ Not exactly cause there was rude service. There was this supervised I was really disappointed cause she try to kick us out. She even made us eat or we will pay I know that the rule and it's ok when she tried reminding us she said it in a rude way. The last time I ate there I stopped eating there for like 5-7 month,  the last time there she did the same thing. This time she did the same thing again but now worst she as if we were the half and half family **** she. She not allow to say that.
I was going to give this place 3-4 stars, the service was mediocre but the food was actually pretty good. But then I saw the Sushi chef start throwing pieces of fish from the fridge on to his cutting board. In the process I saw him drop a piece of squid on to the floor. After he finished throwing the rest of the fish on to the cutting board he thought he was being slick and picked up that piece of squid walked over to the sink and started rinsing it off...... but I saw him do that, he turned around and we locked eyes and he knew that I caught him being shady. He quickly returned to rinsing off the fish and quickly threw it back into a bin inside the fridge. And then he quickly beelined it into the kitchen.. . Gross. This all happened as I was on my way out of the restaurant. I'm hoping that didn't happen to any of my fish or your fish for that matter.
Long wait to be seated. Once you're seated, you may end up using some other customer's back like the back of your own chair...or worse, you could be seated back to back with a BABY IN A HIGHCHAIR! I've never been seated so closely to other patrons. That takes away from my experience in a restaurant right off the top.. . The sushi was good and tasted pretty fresh. That waitress was somewhat hard to understand, she appeared to be very, very shy. Luckily, in this restaurant any of the waitstaff that passes you by will refill your drinks or place another order for food.. . I know someone who was followed out the door for not leaving a tip. His waitress ran outside and yelled "was the food not good, was the service not good?!". I've never heard of this happening anywhere else before. And to my recollection, he stated that the answer to one or both of those questions was "yes".
I hate the service takes forever to be seated, a part of the store was dark but still okay to sit in and they wouldn't let us sit there so we waited an hour to get seated. They said they did it for customer satisfaction but ur service is already horrible.
Hands down best overall sushi place inLas Vegas.. Service is a little slow because the place is always packed but you can't beat the variety and flavor and freshness of the sushi rolls.
Ahhh Yama sushi! There's plenty of fish in the sea and after all the sushi restaurant searching in my hometown i've finally found you! Yelp may not be a dating site but it sure connected me to you! ;) i love you for 3 reasons! A. I can afford you! You're a cheap date in so many ways! You offer me not only quality but also quantity! Let's face it we all need quality relationships but A LOT of it. B.) you're delicious!  Im not one to usually order rolls at a sushi restaurants but you have many rolls i'd well i'd roll with. Your NO NAME ROLL tickles me in all the right taste buds! Finally C. I love that you offer so many tasty appetizers to excite me before the rest of the goodness comes out. It may be safe to call those appetizers foreplay. ;) You offer HAMACHI KAMA! My fav, most places make you pay extra so i thank you for that. All in all i see this relationship going places and that we're going to make it!  although i do wish u weren't so busy sometimes! I constantly have to wait for you in a line but you're worth it and at the end of the day, There's no drama for my mama either, only YaMA for my mama. see you soon my love!
"This place is great!" All you can eat for $20, "YES!"  I had three servings of the Harry Potter! Lol. It's that good!!!!!! If you want good, fresh sushi....."Go here!" Hole in the wall location....."Big Taste!" The sake is good too. :-)
