when in Las Vegas, you shouldn't expect good, quality foods. however, you SHOULD expect to pay an outrageous amount for low quality, tasteless food. I really don't understand how this restaurant received a 4/5 star review. maybe everyone is drinking or already drunk so they can't accurately make a review. a plate of flavorless pasta will set you back $25 before tax. the service was fine, no complaints on that part. the food was so terrible that no matter how good the service could have been, it still. would have been a horrible experience. do. yourself a favor and go to Walgreens or CVS and buy a styrofoam cooler, gets drinks and snacks to keep in your room so you don't have to go out every time you want something to eat.
After a long night at Hakasaan.  We came to eat here, yes it was 5:30 in the morning so we were 1 of 3 tables.  The service was ok, he took a while to check back for our drink refills.   The food was just ok.  Nothing spectacular.  The food was overpriced but I expect this in Vegas.  Overall just ok.
Good food although we ate light. Had a specialty drink that was great. Told the waiter how much I enjoyed it and he came back with a printout of the recipe. Prices in casinos are always inflated so it obviously isn't going to be cheap but we still ate cheaper and better than senior frogs
I'm gonna be honest - I ate here after a night of drinking, britney concert, gambling and more drinking. With that said.. the pizza was amazing!! Also, the service was spot on considering it was 2am.
We dine here and pay by our MGM resort credit, which is very good experience for another famous Chef is Las Vegas.. . The restaurant is casual and service is also warm. Don't need to make a reservation and  the dress code is also casual.. . Nice try for Wolfgang and we enjoy the dish and drink we order.
The food is great, second time we ate here while in vegas and I must say it was just as good as the last time, not to mention the service is great very friendly staff that makes you feel right at home. Next time you're here try the crab cakes and chili glazed chicken wings. Oh and can't forget desert try the creme brule.
I was hesitant to eat here, as the menu just didn't sound that appealing, but the husband was adamant about coming here, so we did. I am glad we ended up here! The service was outstanding! Very attentive, friendly, and filled with great recommendations. I had their pineapple mojito at the recommendation of our server and it was the perfect amount of herb and sweet.... very good. It was 12$, but hey, this is Vegas.... that was kind of a steal. For lunch, I had their soup of the day... a Thai coconut chicken soup.... it was sooo good. The best part was the tender mushrooms, and I don't even like mushrooms! The husband had a club sandwich, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. It came with a nice salad that was lightly dressed. Lunch was a bit pricey at about 50$, but considering I got a drink, this wasn't too bad. I would come back!
We were looking for a nice place to eat before a concert and I'm so glad this was suggested. It was a great bargain for the excellent food and service. Four of us shared 4 dishes which were all excellent. I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo served over polenta, the balance of creamy texture and spice was amazing. The rigatoni with sausage was comfort food perfected. I didn't try the steak skewers, but my friends that had it, loved them. The last dish we had was a pizza with prosciutto, feta, basil and olives. It was rich, but delicious. The service was friendly and efficient.
From the first time I tried out Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill out of convenience, I have been back multiple times! Wolfgang's service and food have been consistently good, which seems to keep some regular customers over the weekend. . . The bar is a one of the best seats in the house! The bartenders are always on top of everything where my water was always filled and the dishes were always ready to be peppered; top notch! Wolfgang is a nice restaurant, but still casual enough where they have items priced from $15-30 (including pizza, sandwich, pasta, fish, and burgers). . . -Dishes-. . Linguine Pancetta with steamed clams: My go to dish at Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill! I always order this dish when I drop by Vegas. It's flavorful and the balance between the clams and Pancetta makes this dish buttery good. . . Cesar Salad: Visually pleasing and tasty with the right amount of dressing.. One of the best Cesar Salad I have ordered, nom!. . Burger and Fries: Burger layered to perfections; juicy meat with fresh buns! The fries are 'to die' for as well; no stale fries!. . Tortellini Short Rib with Squash Puruee: This dish is a balance of the sweetness from the squash and heavier sauce versus the Short Ribs. It's great! This dish is a slightly lighter than other, which is a great option for a smaller stomach. . . Overall, great food with chic decor inside MGM!
I came here on vacation with a bunch of my friends to get away and we decided to go to Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill. Unfortunately, one of my friends got sick with the flu on our trip, so he wasn't able to eat most foods. We went to this restaurant and were fortunate enough to have Bradford as our waiter. We were casually talking to him and told him our friend got sick and he decided to give us chicken broth to go for him to help with his flu. Bradford was so thoughtful and caring! I will be sure to come back here and I hope to have Bradford as my waiter again.
Natalie and her partner "the 70's porn star" were awesome last night behind the bar!  The food and drinks were perfect!  Natalie gave her recommendations and she was right!  The tuna tartare was fresh and tasty, the spaghetti w/meatballs was freaking awesome, and my wife had the veggie pizza that was very fresh and was cooked perfectly!!!  The customer service was perfect!  Both bartenders really seemed to enjoy talking to is and it made the experience perfect!  Thank you
The service was good and the place has a nice ambience to it. The food is good but nothing really to boast about. I had the linguine with grilled jumbo shrimp and my bf had breakfast sandwich. The serving size is quite generous but I find that both dishes are overly salty.
Wanted to try this restaurant being as we were in Vegas and Wolfgang Puck is a renowned chef. My experience wasn't bad by any means, but after having been to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR restaurant the night before, this place fell short of my expectations. . . I got their linguini with shrimp, which was good, but for the restaurant I was in and the price I was paying, I would have wanted something that blew me away. This dish did not. My friend got their fish with a side of pasta, and her fish was a little on the dry side. We had to ask for bread a couple of times--it wasn't automatically brought to our table. The ambience of the restaurant was ok--a little too floral for my taste but you could tell it was an upscale place.. . I did like our waiter--he was friendly and helped to customize my friend's order so that she got the pasta on the side instead of the veggies, and he didn't charge her extra. . . I would say there are too many other restaurants to try in Vegas, you wouldn't be missing out on anything passing over this place.
I've been wanting to try a Wolfgang Puck restaurant for a long time, and it definitely did not disappoint! I came to the MGM location on a double date during lunch time, and they have a pretty extensive menu at the expected price range. . . I ordered the white pizza, which was topped with ricotta, caramelized onions, garlic, chicken, and spinach. I loved that the pizza was not overly creamy, and the ingredients were just the right amount to not overwhelm the thin crust. My boyfriend had the burger, which had a hefty patty that was cooked perfectly. The seeded bun was a nice touch, and the shoestring fries were crispy but not oily. My best friend had the chinois salad, which was also an extremely generous size. The flavors were great, and the dressing was not too heavy as to overwhelm the veggies. Her boyfriend ordered the fish and chips, breaded to the ideal ratio and revealing perfectly flaky fish in the inside. Overall, we had a really satisfying meal that didn't overwhelm our stomachs and left our tastebuds happy!
Great place to dine when at the MGM. Good pasta and average pizza. A bit costly but it's ok.
