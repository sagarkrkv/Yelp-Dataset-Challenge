So when I heard Chinese Mexican fusion I expected something different than what it was. However, I wasn't disappointed when I saw the menu. It's broken up into Mexican style dishes and Chinese style dishes. Our server said it was similar to a "tapas" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. I ordered the Mexican asparagus and the Chinese Dancing Eggplant. The asparagus was amazing and I devoured all of it. Honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. The eggplant wasn't really what I expected. It's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (I forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). The eggplant was not the texture I expected. Was hoping for something I would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. The taste was okay but I couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. We had them bring chips and salsa for the table and both were really good. I ordered the classic margarita and was not disappointed. If I ever make it back I really want to try the margarita flight, as a friend did and said it was amazing. Our server was great, answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations around the table that were raved about. He had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!. . My gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, I had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which I was really excited about). I wish I would have ordered the tacos because they looked really good. A friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost ordered off the Mexican portion of the menu.
Overrated and pricey!  I wanted chinese noodles but got soup instead.  The mexican dishes were very bland.  I immediately got a stomach ache from the food.  Paid close to $90 for four small plates for dinner.  My feelings hurt more than my tummy.  Gave this two stars because the service was good at least.
Salt foam margarita was very good.  After we ate there, I was dreaming of the dim sum.  I have been eating shu mai and BBQ pork buns my entire life and those were the best I've ever had.  The pork and scallop shu mai are so juicy and flavorful, it's crazy.  They gild the lily with gold leaf on the scallop one.  I think they have a tasting menu to try as well, I cannot wait to go back here.
Food here is really, unexpectedly good BUT the portions are tiny and can be pretty pricey.    I don't think I'd eat here again just because spending $6-7 for one taco (no matter how good it is) just irks my practical side.  On the other hand if someone else was footing the bill I'd try everything here :).
I have been here a couple times with work colleagues and have always had good meals.  I was there recently again and we shared a variety of dishes.  They had a special noodle dish the night we were there.  It was one long continuous noodle with pork belly and veggies.  It was very tasty.  We also had tuna tartar, Mongolian beef, chicken lettuce wraps, queso fundido, some tacos.  Probably a few other things.  Everything was very tasty - nothing too spicy but definitely flavorful.  The guys had the salt air margaritas and loved those.  This is definitely a great place to go to share food and try lots of yummy things.  I definitely will be back.
carnitas taco and the pork belly shrimp dumplings were perfect. good service at the bar. would definitely come back to try more.
Nice, artsy experience. Bartender interesting to watch invent a new cocktail. Beautiful presentation. Delicious Guacamole and Queso Fundido con Chorizo.
We had reservations for a party of eight after seeing a show at Cosmo. The love for food was strong with the servers of China Poblano, they were passionate and very educational about their concept. Everything was fresh and flavorful. . I highly recommend anything with their amazing corn tortillas! And their mole was delicious, the chocolate pepper creaminess was melt in your mouth amazing. . Go and try their small plates, take the advice of the staff.
Holy Moly Guacamole!!. . I LOVE hot food, AND being indoors!!  This place has them BOTH!!  China De Mexico (as it's known to me and my friends) is hip, is hop, is what's happening!!  Now I've never eaten there, nor have I been, I'm on a fixed income and live very far away.  But I know what I like and I like China Poblano.  But if was able to eat there I think it would go a little something like this:  "Hello waiter, may I come indoor and order hot food?"  "Ce Senor, would you like the chop sticks?"  "Yes, my new best friend, I would."  . And so on.
Creative food but okay quality.  Very small quantity. Great service. My favorite is the lobster taco. But probably won't come back.
This is what food is about. A perfect confluence of cultures and flavors. Fresh, fast and varied. The menu hits all the sweet spots while still being inventive. Definitely order an item from each category: taco, dim sum and noodles. Our favorites on this visits: Chilorio de Res (taco: short rib, Padilla negro, cumin, cilantro) and Dan Dan Mian ( wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce/peanuts). . . The aesthetic of place: surreal mixture of Hispanic meets Asian. Funky and fun like a street art house. . . Come and enjoy...as we have, did and will. Do.
My first unpleasant dining experience in Vegas. . . Service was great but what's going on with the food, the pricing, and the portions. . . The food started off great! Chips included with the chips and salsa were delicious and fresh. The chipotle salsa not so much. . . Thee 18 Monk Noodles was fine. Noodles were very good but the soy sauce was way overpowering. . . Mongolian beef wasn't great either. Actually it was terrible besides the fact that the Beef was cooked perfectly and served over romaine lettuce. The sauce was overpowering and not pleasant at all. . . The tacos are expensive, bland, and contain little fillings  . . Tinga Poblana, Carnitas tacos are very bland. The only thing you could taste is the corn tortilla. . . We also had the spicy pork noodles. The sauce was not good at all and made me not want to continue eating. . . Overall a very expensive, bland and unpleasant dining experience. . . I would strongly suggest you not waste your money here.
I didn't try any of the Chinese food, the tacos were tasty but overpriced in my book. I wouldn't come here again.
We stayed at the Cosmo a few years ago and have wanted to try this place ever since.  We walked up at about 6 on a Sunday night. They said they could seat us right away at the bar.  After a long day of traveling we were ok with that.  The bar stools are wooden so a little uncomfortable.  We started with the chips and salsa which are fantastic.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita and my husband ordered a coke.  The margarita was some kind of "air" margarita so it was different but good.  For our entrees we ordered the "when pigs fly" which are pulled pork type dumpling rolls, carnitas taco, another beef taco(can't remember the name) and a beet salad.  Portions are a bit small for the price.  That's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  It was all delicious and service was good!
Service is awesome, atmosphere is nice ,but the food is not. always thought restaurants in hotels like this food should be great but not here. We had Dancing eggplant don't know why for some reason its so freaking salty i do hope who even prepare this knows how salty this eggplant is i know they said it has soy sauce but i didn't know they will just pour soy sauce in it. We also had Gan pung ji chicken its as salty as the eggplant. The only thing i did like is their chips and salsa tasted fresh. Their vegetable fried rice like they said its good give it a 2 stars. sorry but i will never suggest wasting your money here.
Terrible: courses arrived at different times (explanation was that there are 3 kitchens so of course we should understand), the advertised shredded chicken came in big pieces including cartilage and a hunk of boiled skin (explanation was that the chef says the skin adds flavor), lots of unnecessary fat in the dishes we ordered, and all this with high prices.  Go somewhere else.
If you read my review of Jaleo, you will find that I love, love, love Jose Andres and everthing he touches. China Poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where I want to eat (I mean, it IS pricy, so I only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) Everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. . . Yes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the Cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). Yes, the portions are small. Yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). . . We always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?). . --. Favorite items:. Guacamole with chips and salsa - $15. Handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. Bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging. . Viva China taco - $5.50. Rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. Bypass if you do not like foods with "weird" textures. . . Lamb Potstickers stuck on you - $12.88. Pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. Must have. . Dan Dan Mian - $12.88. Love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. Could be spicier. Have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so I could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. Must have. . . Don't Be Jealous - $11.88. This is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup I've ever seen in my life. Definitely meant for at least 4 people. Not a traditional hot and sour soup. Is pretty thick. Very good. . . Discontinued items?:. They had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. It did NOT look appetizing but was DELICIOUS. It looks like a frog with red warts on it. I no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, I recommend it!. . They also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. Tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. Sprayed with tequila. You are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. I no longer see it on the menu, though. . --. Drinks:. Salt air margarita - $14. What fun! Yummy, boozy fun. . Blood orange chile pequin margarita - $15 / glass. Yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! . --. . Not such a fan of:. They always push the 20-vegetable fried rice because Johnny Iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show "Best Thing I Ever Ate." I find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.. . Dancing Eggplant - really pretty! I don't really like eggplant in general, though. . --. . Cons about the restaurant itself:. The restaurant is literally right outside of Marquee. At lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. At dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. Luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. . . The chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. I'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. There are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.
First of all, this place isn't really fusion, it's Chinese and Mexican side-by-side. But that's okay. The Chinese food was definitely better than the tacos we tried (which were good I'm from California and my standards for tacos are very high). This place is worth it for the Chinese food. The Dan Dan Mian was to die for. Our dumplings were excellent too. I would go back for the Dan Dan Mian alone! . . The ambiance is good. Festive, and the decor is interesting to look at. I do wish more of the seats had backs on them, though.. . Service was excellent.
