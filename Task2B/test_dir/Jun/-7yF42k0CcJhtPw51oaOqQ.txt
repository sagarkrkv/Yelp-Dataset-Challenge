One of the best Hotels in Vegas. Unlike others who are deteriorating with age, the Bellagio is still a beautiful, vibrant hotel. The fountains and the indoor gardens are awesome. Two of my favorite things in this city, in the same hotel. Awesome. The rooms are very nice. Some of the nicest I've stayedin. Lots of time went into the decorating. If you want a nice, clean, respectable hotel, this is a great option. This and the Wynn are my favorites.
We stayed at the Bellagio many times and this time it was not worth my time or money.. I would like everyone who reads this review to be aware of the rooms on the 4th - 11th floors the odd number rooms facing the dumpsters and the truck cleaning machine.. The hotel had a crew of workings all hours of the night dumping beer cans and bottles in the dumpsters. It was extremely loud.. We stayed in room 7079.. The truck with this loud whining would start at 6 am and finish about 30 minutes later.. Please ask for a different location
This is a high class hotel but a little bit old. Vintage Style(?). Staffs are very helpful.. Good size room for 4 people. Don't forget to ask the fountain view room. Buffet is reasonable price $33/weekday, $39/weekend for their food are very fresh.
The Bellagio is a very well updated hotel right in the middle of the strip which is why my boyfriend and I decided to do our staycation from our anniversary here! First, the parking garage is easy to maneuver around and the lobby isn't too far from the garage. We were staying on a Sunday night and the figured the line to check in wouldn't be too bad. Well, we were wrong. Their system was down. Which is understandable. I don't mind waiting but when we finally got to the person checking us in, I tried to be friendly and spark some conversation considering she was probably having a bad day due to the system being down... No response. She just clicked away at her computer. Alright, so I guess it was a REALLY bad day. We got our keys and our room was a little ways away.. No big deal if you aren't lugging around a lot of things but we had a lot of stuff so it was kind of annoying. There was security checking to make sure you had a room key before going up which was nice. When we got to our room, it was nicely decorated but not entirely clean. There was still some hair in the bathroom and the bed linens didn't seem to be changed. There also wasn't a mini fridge in the room. I have never stayed in a hotel where a mini fridge wasn't standard. There also weren't any outlets in the bathroom.... Uhm what? The walls were also super thin. We could hear everything around us. The Bellagio is supposed to be one of the nicest hotels on the strip but it is subpar.
Only reason for 4 stars was my 35.00 bacon and eggs!  I make good money and I have to tell you.  Some things feel like to much. Lobster I get. Steak I get...... Hmmmm Beacon & eggs? . . Plus tons of passing through traffic from other hotel peeps. Feels like Disney Hotel. Great if your up for stopping and taking peoples pictures. Hey sometimes I like the kids and family picture day feel :).   . . The Hotel is very nice and people great.. . . . Verses the others? . . Aria: less crowded and better priced food, cool vibe. the Venetian: Has cool vibe and bigger rooms . Wynn: Dull feeling.  To stuffy and staff not as nice. Caesar: Up beat and like the feel.  Nice remodeled room and great location. . Hey I go a lot :)
Horrible horrible front desk service and Manager.  Azi was curt, rude and completely devoid of understanding  of the fact that I was given very bad checkin information on the phone by their staff.  I will never choose to book a room here again and the only reason I'm staying here tonight is because my husband is attending a conference.
Beautiful room, sparkling clean, fabulous view. Lots of bells and whistles. Staff were marvelous. Picasso restaurant vegetarian dinner was fantastic. Pricey.
I have been a regular guest at the Bellagio twice a year for the past several years.  I have always looked forward to the environment and amenities that it has, but over time I see things slipping and I now need to reconsider if I will try another resort.. . The buffet quality and selection has decreased.. . I have always been granted at least 30 min late check out, but this time I was told the hotel was sold out and extending  was not possible UNLESS I wanted to pay for extra hours.. . One of the things that has drawn me to the Bellagio was that I felt that the hotel did anything it could to make my stay comfortable.  Now I see it more interested in drawing crowds an making money.
This casino is just beautiful...that is the best way to describe it! They had a really cool display with a huge bird house with cute little finches inside. Then all around it they had flower sculptures of birds and snails. Absolutely gorgeous!
Had a really great stay here and after seeing other supposed high end hotels on the strip, I'm glad I stayed here. I'll mention the amenities and restaurants here that I used. First I had booked a room that faced away from the fountains because you're never in your room anyway, and when you are, you just want to relax and sleep and not listen to lots of noise outside. The standard king room was very comfortable, quiet, and restful. Nice large bathroom with two sinks, glass shower and jacuzzi tub.  I asked for a lower floor so I could be first on and off the elevators. The pool area gets pretty busy by 11am but still possible to find a spot after that. I wouldn't say that the pools had a real party atmosphere to them, but more relaxed. The gym was very big and had a lot of free weights, machines, and cardio. I ate breakfast twice at the Jean Phillipe bakery and I highly recommend the Forest crepe. I also ate dinner at Fix which was good but expensive. All the food and drinks are overpriced but that is too be expected. All the staff I spoke with were professional and polite. I would definitely stay here again.
Nothing more to add other than its a Vegas casino, a nice Vegas casino. Yes, there's still smoke, and men in tank tops, and hookers. You want to avoid all that? Don't come to Las Vegas. . Service is quite good, restaurants are nice, the pool is fun. I can't speak to the gambling...that's not my thing.
This is a classy hotel but in my opinion mostly for couples or middle age up people.if you want to see a young crowd, stay at somewhere else.. If you stay at Bellagio, try to get the fountain view room and enjoy the amazing show day and night.. The room and bathroom are big and comfortable enough even if you want to spend the whole day in the room.. I was really disappointed about the restaurants of the hotel.. For a classy one, I was expecting to have some nice dining experiences but I can say they were generally the worst of my trip..
Although our view of the fountains were spectacular, I found the room to be dingy, old, and small, compared to the Wynn or Encore.  Also, since we were taking the red eye back to Boston, I paid for an extra half day until 6pm on a Friday.  At 5:45, my daughter and sister tried to get into the hotel room, and it was locked - our keys turned off!!  The security guard could not reach a manager, and would not let us in to get our luggage, even after I showed them my receipt and my ID.  I was furious.  I called the front desk several times before I got the "on call" manager.  She apologized, and refunded my fee for the half day.  Meanwhile, she said we had a limo ride to the airport, all taken care of "just go to the bell man out front; they have your name".  Needless to say, when I went there, they had no idea what I was talking about, so I again tried to reach a manager in vain.  It is apparent that one hand has no clue what the other is doing in this large hotel; God forbid, if there was an emergency in a room - they wouldn't let you into your own room!!  We ended up taking a cab to the airport.  The manager did call me again after I reached the airport to apologize for a second time about the lack of communication.  You can always walk by the fountains; I do not recommend staying here if you are used to first class service and excellent, modern accommodations.
I came for Vegas for the conference and had my 2 year old baby. Bellagio provided me with a crib and all babies bathroom accessories. That was nice. Unlike other hotels on strip, there was no sigar smell. The only what I didn't  like was that there was no coffee maker in the room.
Horrible service. First and last time here. Checked in and was promised a room with a view. The lady at the front desk offered us a complimentary bottle of champagne which didn't come. Our "view" is of the parking lot. Asked to speak to a manager who was very curt and rude. Didn't apologize for the mix up. I'm sorry as a guest I bothered her. Next time stay at Caesar's. A bit older, but much better service and views.
Having stayed at many hotels on The Strip in Vegas, I'm going to throw out there that the Bellagio is my favorite.  It's classified as a "5 star" hotel, and I think they mean it.  The rooms are so comfortable, elegant, and modern.  There's so much to do in the Bellagio including food, shows, the casino, the pools, etc.  The Bellagio has the best restaurants in Vegas; Three of them (Le Cirque, Picasso, Michael Mina) are Michelin star rated (and worthy of the rating).   I've also been to the Yellow Tail, and it's an amazing sushi spot. The Pool Side Cafe is great for a late morning brunch while recovering from the night before.  . . The Bellagio doesn't have the swanky, young, and modern feel of the Cosmo - another hotel which I love.  But, every time I'm stumbling back to my room, the Bellagio feels like "home".  The location can't be beat either, and the staff there treats everyone like royalty.  I can't recommend this hotel enough.. . PRO TIP:  If you want to stay at the Bellagio, I HIGHLY recommend you use Hotwire.  If you use Hotwire and do your research to pick the venue with the right amenities, then you have basically a 50-50 shot of landing either Bellagio or Aria for $100 a night (a steal).
The plan was to switch away from M life resorts and establish a relationship with Wynn and/or Caesars after a so so trip to the Mirage last month. That was until a last minute trip with a 92 year old friend looking to scratch something off his bucket list with a trip to the Bellagio and the O show.. . The Bellagio was just amazing. From the hotel, the atmosphere, the welcoming friendly staff, the fountain, the super clean beautiful room with the awesome view, the cafe, the conservancy and the O show. Gambling was good too.. It was so good that I'm going back with the family in 2 weeks to spoil them too.. . I wish I got more names to single out some great staff. There was the young lady that checked us in and took special care of us. There is a very nice and the best beverage server at Bellagio with the purple highlights in her hair( liked her hair, let her keep the purple ) Maryann at Petrossian lounge is a sweetheart and Reatta the usher at the O show is the real star of that show. If more people were like her the world would be a better place.
I was attracted by the grand water fountain when driving down Las Vegas Blvd ~ what a frontage! I was really impressed with the ceiling design at the lobby but not impressed when I entered my suite. The room is ordinary and maybe needs a design update. The cafe next to the garden is a Must Try!!
BUT A long list of things I that weren't great. *booked 2 rooms at the same time...however we ended up in two different towers and there was "no way" for us to be closer. *no help with luggage- so you walk thru the casino and tourists areas which dodging tour groups and struggling with luggage. *wifi was horrible. Although we paid $28 a day in resort fees half the time the wifi didn't work. *cleaning products were left in our room by staff. *not enough seating in lobby. Checkout time is 11 and we weren't able to get a late checkout... So spent an hour sitting way too close to each other on couches that weren't comfy. *venitlation system is horrible- casino reeks of smoke (so after walking through it so did I) . *room ac wasn't great. Always seemed warm in room. We paid quite a bit for these rooms and truthfully don't think it was worth it:(
I was so excited to come to the Ballagio.....I WISH I NEVER CAME....The noise from the nightclub was crazy.....I was up from 1am to 4am listening to a DJ, music, and screaming....I was on the 17th floor and it still was loud as heck....IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUIET....DON'T COME HERE......We planned on staying 2 nights but decided to check out and go somewhere else...CHECK OUT WAS A NIGHTMARE.... . Johathan needs to learn to quit yapping and check out/in customers.....I waited 40 minutes in line and he only got through 2 people checking out......TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. . NO FRIDGE IN THE ROOM.....Had to keep our drinks cold with ice.....WHICH WAS LIKE A MILE AWAY.. . Make sure you bring lots of money if your thirsty.....$5.00 for a coke.....Way overrated....If you want to check out a REAL HOTEL for the same price? CHECK OUT HOTEL 32 AT THE MONTE CARLO......Way better than this place
I've been to 5 different hotels in Vegas and thought I'd give this one a try this I've heard lots of good things and because the view of the fountain would be nice.  I originally booked a Fountain View room and when I went to check in, I had asked the receptionist if she could make sure we have a really nice view.  I was so pumped up to get to the room that when I looked outside the window I was so disappointed.  I did not realize Bellagio had a 2nd building on the side and the view was not what I was expecting.  If I wanted a side view of the fountain, I would have asked for that or go to the COSMOPOLITAN and pay less and have a nicer and newer room.  The should advertise our room as SIDE VIEW FOUNTAIN ROOM.  Quite a disappointment. . . I will most likely keep away from this specific hotel for a while... I had an issue with their Roulette table scamming me.  I sat at a $25 table and asked for $1 chips.  Thedealer said this is a $25 table and I had to have $5 chips.  That was a lie because I've done it before at other casinos.  This was a cheating way to get me to waste my money.. . I've decided to stick to a 2 star rating, however, overall the service wasn't too bad.  I had some issues with their Jean Phillipe Patisserie charging someone else's room and the supervisor messed up and didn't refund properly... I am still dealing with their Guest Services for all the issues they put me through.  Having to speak with hotel and MLIFE is a bit annoying since they are separate departments.. . Concierge was extremely helpful with assisting me with my tickets for the Cirque show because we had to swap something.  The buffet had amazing service.  . . Bellagio is rating quite high among the other hotels (5 diamond/star?), however they had failed to provide that experience to me this time.
