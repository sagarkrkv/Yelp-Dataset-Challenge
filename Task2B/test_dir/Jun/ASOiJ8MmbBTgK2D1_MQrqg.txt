The view from the restaurant is amazing. The service was pretty good, but the food was on another level. A very good restaurant for someone who wants to explore
Came here for dinner with my wife for our first anniversary. I ordered the char-broiled Filet Mignon, Rossini Style. Regrettably I ordered it medium (old precaution from other restaurants), but it was still excellent. It was very tender and tasted excellent. My wife was also very pleased with what she had ordered.. . Overall it was a very good meal and a wonderful romantic atmosphere.
We'll all I can say is that I was really looking forward to this place which only lead to a colossal disappointment.  Dinner for two was 320 bucks.  Beef Wellington and filet mignon.  Sure it was good but truth be told, if it was 150 bucks and I had no expectations, I would give it four stars.  It tasted fine and the experience was fine. . . For 320 bucks, nobody wants "Fine" therefore I give it only two stars.. Food. - 3 (Ruth's Chris is way better and half as much). Service - 5. Price - 0 . Atmosphere - 3 (loud for such a pricey place). View - 5 ... Sit on the glass facing west if you can, you'll see the bellagio water show
Service A+. View A+. Food A. . I was very impressed with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant experience we enjoyed last night.. From the moment you enter the elevator to the middle of the faux Eiffel Tower you are treated like princes and princesses.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and our waitress was fantastic. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, honest in her recommendations and did her best to meet some of our more food restrictive diners.. Our table had an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains which made every 15 minutes a treat.. . We started with a fennel parfait compliments of the chef.  For an appetizer we shared a seafood treasure chest of lobster, crab leg, oysters, shrimp and a seafood salad.  For an appetizer, a single order of the seafood appetizer will be enough for two to share.. . For dinner I enjoyed the beef wellington, light and flaky with an earthy mushroom flavor and beautifully cooked so it cut like butter and melted in your mouth.. . We also tried the Rabbit which was surprisingly tasty, flaky but moist.. The crab salad was also well presented.. . The restaurant was able to accomodate the special requests for a picky eater in our company who has several allergies.  When they couldn't, they were quick to inform her of the reason and other options.. . I have to say I was very disappointed in the kids menu.  Although reasonably priced and with crayons and a kids coloring menu, the options were pasta with butter or marinara, grilled cheese and chicken.  I mean this is a beautiful, top food restaurant and you can't get more creative on your kids menu?  So many restaurants sell the kids tastes short but I would have gladly paid an extra couple of dollars forher to be able to add shrimp or chicken to her pasta, or have a fish option.. . Other than the kids menu, it was a fantastic dining experience.. NOTE: This is one of those places where you pay more for the location and view so the prices will be high.  It is also one of those places where it is worth the price.. . NOTE 2: Although I was there with my family, this would be a very romantic date spot.
The 1 star is a review for our lunch on Friday, June 13, 2014. . . Went here for lunch with a friend! I only have one complaint-- our server, Rafael A.! . . Rafael was very unprofessional, unfriendly, and boring!  We always say "Thank you" and not even a single word of "You're welcome" is mentioned! He did not even bother to ask us how our lunch/food was. He just ignored us the entire time ! . . Anyway, the view is breathtaking ,. Food is great, and other staff were nice!. . Last time I went here was on my birthday dinner with my boyfriend! Everything went great! It was wonderful, especially when my boyfriend surprised me with dozen of roses and one whole cake made by their executive chef!. .  Oh  and our server, John was awesome---- way better than that boring, incompetent, Rafael!
Visited the Eiffel Tower restaurant over the weekend for our 1st year anniversary. Very romantic restaurant overlooking the strip. Our view was the fountain at Bellagio.  Food is delicious and customer service is beyond outstanding!
Great french food and the somelier will give you perfect advice for the best pairing within your budget and tastes.
The food here was very good, I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off, but very good.. . The service was excellent, very attentive staff kept our drinks filled and frequently checked in on us.. . As others have noted, you're paying for the views of Vegas strip mostly.  I think the experience is worth the price.  But don't order drinks. $20 for a cocktail is away over the top, when you could put that $20 in slot machine downstairs and get free drinks.
Food was good but not necessarily what I consider over-the-top as their prices reflect. Definitely paying for the view which is pretty awesome. Biggest complaint we had is that there is a dress code for men and that doesn't seem to be advertised anywhere. Women can pretty much show everything but guys better have on long pants and socks or you'll be given a pair to put on. The socks were new. We all hoped the pants were laundered in between wears...
After posting my review I was contacted and reimbursed for the dinner portion of our visit. This was an acceptable resolution.
Excellent food . Excellent service. Spectacular view. Alix was our server and she was awesome
I was very excited to eat here for our 2nd year anniversary. When you arrive (reservation require) the first thing you see is the kitchen, then this amazing bar. They sat us down in a table right next to the window where the Bellagio waters were our view. I started of w/ the warm lobster salad and I loved it! My bf has the smoked salmon and it was very tasty as well. For our entree I had rack of lamb and he had a steak, for my taste I did not enjoy it very much. For dessert I had cream brulee and he had this caramel apple something. Over all the experience and the view was amazing but I cannot say the same for the food. So just be prepare to pay big bucks for the experience and not so much for the food.
Great food and great customer service. Tried the Halibut with asparagus on the side with Pistachio souffle as the dessert. It was all DELICIOUS! My husband had the lamb with creamed spinach and ate everything (well with my help on the spinach bc it was really good too lol) I will definitely come there again when I have the chance.
