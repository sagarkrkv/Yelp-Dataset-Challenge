Russell from the Bell Desk was Incredible.. He was so friendly, apologized for an unusually long wait to have our bags brought up, and stayed with us for a few minutes to go over all of the amenities and features of the hotel.. . It really set the tone for our entire stay! . Hopefully heis valued as an employee, he is really a shining star!!. . The hotel really has become my favorite, all of the staff went out of their way, the rooms were clean, really nice (especially the suite) and the restaurants were phenomenal.  Not to mention Cirque de Soleil "one" plays there.. . Don't consider staying anywhere else.
THEhotel ranks as my 2nd worst stay in Vegas, and trust me, I've stayed at about 15 of the strip (or near strip) hotels.. . All I have to say is if you're reading this close to today's date DO NOT STAY ON THE 26th FLOOR. And soon, don't stay on a few floors below this. They are slowly renovating the hotel from the top down... 24 F*****G 7. What hotel renovates for 24 hours and has guests on an adjacent floor? Yep, that means drilling, scraping, banging, and every other horrid noise was going on all-night-long. . . I was staying here for work and had no patience for the lack of sleep I encountered. I called the desk several times in the night, especially between 3 and 4am (pretty reasonable quiet sleeping times, right?) and got nowhere. I was offered free breakfast for the troubles. FREE BREAKFAST?!? First of all, my work conference was feeding me so this was useless to me, second of all, this does not solve the issue at hand here. When asking to move to another floor they told me that it was sold out and they couldn't move me. That night in the middle of the night, fine... but they even said over the next two days it was not likely they could move me. This makes zero sense. There are plenty of times in the day when rooms open up, why couldn't they move me? On my 5th or so call I made progress with a new front desk receptionist and was told I could move at some point that day. First issue solved (after getting 1.5 hours of solid sleep before a 9 hour day of importantmeetings..... great). I was also appalled that when a room opened while I was at work (they would only hold the room until 5:30pm for me) they wouldn't move my luggage for me. What hotel won't do this? I've been to countless places who will do this. I gave permission, I begged, I lost.. . Aside from the construction disaster and poor customer service, this place is renovating for a reason. There was something crusty (I don't want to even know) on my bed frame and stains on the comforter. This was one of the most uncomfortable hotel beds with paper like sheets and one of those comforters you just want to throw on the floor and never touch again. Carpet was extremely dirty, and the room stunk. I can't even describe the smell but it was pumping through the AC and it was just awful.. . The room was spacious and a "suite" which is nice, but when it comes down to it I'd rather have a nice clean closet sized room than a giant, loud, dirty big room. The bathroom was the nicest, cleanest part of the room, though there was an old guest's used toiletries in the bathroom - so not the most thorough cleaning seems to be done here. Even after turning on every light switch and lamp in this room it is insanely dark- like can't even see in your bag to find something dark.. . You can't pay me to stay here again.
This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The room was amazing as well as the customer service. We waited in line for check in for over an hour and thanks to our patience, they upgraded us to a suite on the 12th floor with a view of the mountains. Everything was perfect and super clean, and I'm a clean freak so when I say clean, it was spotless. Every day during our time out, housekeeping would come in and clean up the room again. I never once saw my own mess reflect in the room. On top of cleanliness, the room was very quiet and I'm a light sleeper. It was a rather long walk to do anything in the hotel such as the pools or restaurants, but frankly I prefer to walk and have the rooms quiet. The places to eat are amazing, but very pricey, as with all Vegas restaurants. The beach pool and lazy river were well worth it as well. We stayed at another hotel after our experience here, and it didn't compare or even come close to my standards. We will always look to stay here when we visit Vegas.
not worth the price.. The Spa is great and quiet, but rooms are just ok and a distance from the pool casino, etc.. Will stay in Mandalay Bay next time
Very disappointing. The view from 4-914 is of nothing. The room is old, the TV is from 1998, the furniture is falling apart and the rug is a new level of nasty that I have not seen in a while. And I got to pay extra for this upgrade!. . Not to mention that I just got a 120 volt shock from the light switch on the wall. That was a nice surprise. . . Needless to say, I will not be coming back anymore or recommending this place to anyone.
impromptu family trip. even though i made the rez, i didn't realize i got THEhotel at mandalay, rather than booking rooms at mandalay bay. . . pros:. - big: all the rooms are suite style with a living room area and 1/2 bath in the front, separated from the bedroom and full bathroom. the 1/2 bath is always nice when you have lots of people staying in room. - separate lobby: THEhotel has it's own separate lobby and entrance. this is super nice since you don't have to walk through the smoke filled casino floor to your hotel room. the elevators are right off the lobby entrance so again, you don't have to trek through the entire casino to get to your rooms. - beds were super comfortable. - both rooms ended up being the disabled room, so there was a roll  in shower, and a bathtub in the bathroom. . . cons:. - the name is CONFUSING AS HELL. you can't just say "THEhotel" you have to keep adding @manadalay bay. can you imagine being drunk and telling the taxi drive that you're staying at "THEhotel"? . - at the far end of the strip. i was with family, so i wasn't really partying or anything, so it wasnt a big deal, but it was a bit of a hassle to get to other hotels since mandalay bay is only connected to luxor (i think). you'd have to drive to get anywhere else. it's really a minor technicality, but keep this in mind if you like gambling/visiting multiple hotels. . would i come again? sure.
I am concerned    I have stayed in The Hotel in the past  and for the most part was satisfied, issues always handled by staff promptly,  Last February the room was a bit ragged but I understand renovations are under way. In Decemeber we chose to stay at the Mandalay.  We arrive in three weeks and if things are as bad as some of the other reveiws I see here perhaps i should be rethinking our stay........Have the rooms really become this rundown? Is housekeeping this inadequate?   This is a special surprise trip for my Hub and do not want to spend the time dealing with issues.
One of my favorite hotels in Vegas. The rooms are pretty nice..  Love the shops, the clubs, the pool.. There is lots of great restaurants in the shops.. Last time I went and stayed was for a UFC event.  It was weidman vs silva.   They also had what I think was called "UFC fan expo" going on at that time.  Ran in to Jon "bones" jones in the lobby...cool as hell.  Even came to my room and chilled for a while.  You never know who you might run into.

I just returned from a two night what the heck let's go to Vegas vacation.  I was in a King Suite with a view of the strip, but where the hotel is located, your "Strip View" is basically the sand and the Luxor.  There are better views in Waco, Texas.  You are so far away from it all, I felt like I was in another city entirely.  If you are with your kids, or love your significant other, a lot, then this hotel can work.  But they pay 6 to 5 for blackjack, every time I sat down some moron would hit a 15 with a dealer showing a 5, beers are $7.03, I know it's Vegas, but really, make it $7.00.  I will say this, the staff is amazing, I will just never stay here again, for any reason.
I was very happy about how nice the guest room was and all its amenities!!! Had a great time with my family here.  Even though our room was not available, they looked for another one right away...And we brought our dog too...extremely dog-friendly place!!! :)
Loved it here! My fiancee and I stayed here for the first time and we will be coming back! Check in was a little bit of a headache but that's understandable as it was a very busy weekend (EDC was happening). . Room was on the 10th floor, view wasn't much but didn't matter to us as we didn't come to Vegas to stare out the window. . . Room was nice and clean, as were the bathrooms. Some of the channels on the bathroom tv didn't work but there were 2 others that were working just fine. . . Ordered room service and the food was awful. (Panini and club sandwich). Food tasted like rubber and fries were hard and cold, but we were hungry and ate it anyway. . . Other than those few little things everything was great. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Definitely conning back- just not ordering room service.
We stayed here (february 2014) when the family decided to join me for a conference that was being held at Mandalay Bay. Yes, it is a quick walk to the casino, food court and convention center but it is well worth it in accommodations and ambiance. The rooms are suites with a separate bedroom and small living room. There is a writing desk in the living room which comes in handy if you are there on business. There is a half bath when you walk in to the room which is perfect if you have guests. the second bathroom has a toilet closet, separate shower and oversized whirlpool tub with a waterfall-like feature. There is a scale in the bathroom that sounds unimportant but really came in handy making sure all our luggage was under the airline travel limit. This is not the cheapest option on the strip but very classy and luxurious. We would definitely stay here again. We had an option to pay ahead for quick check in and this was worth it when we got in at 1 am from an east coast flight.  Our only bad experience was when we got to the hotel, the valet parking for Mandalay Bay was closed so THEhotel valet was the only one open and overwhelmed. It took a long time to valet and for the bellhop to get our luggage up,to our room. Other than this initial "hiccup" which was not fun as a weary traveler with 2 kids in tow, The pool was closed which was a minor disappointment but we live in Florida so we could swim when we got home. Our room was clean, comfortable and stain free unlike other reviewers comments. We did not encounter any construction issues or noise. Overall we had an extremely enjoyable stay.
