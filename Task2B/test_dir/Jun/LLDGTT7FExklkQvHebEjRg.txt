Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab has been around for 100 years. That should tell you something. Awesome steaks, great crab stuffed shrimp and above all the Stone Crabs. I have been there a 1/2 dozen times and they always meet my expectations. The Somelier could use a bit of a peronality adjustment for the gratuity they charged, but that was a small negative.
Wow, this place is really great.  Of course, it is pricey but definitely worth it.  To save some money, you can order off of the Bar Menu selection.  This is what the people in my party did, and the food was no less delicious for it.  To start, the bread was quite tasty.  For dinner, I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries for regular (at no additional cost).  Joe's serves this sandwich akin to sliders, with three small sandwiches on the plate.  The tenderloin was excellent quality, and the bread it was served on was phenomenal.  One other person in my party ordered the Ribeye Sandwich, also from the Bar Menu, and was able to substitute a salad for fries.  This sandwich is served on a sub-type roll.  A very good quality sandwich as well.  We ordered grilled asparagus as a side, which I would say was the only disappointing part of the meal.  It's not that the asparagus was bad, but I feel they charge too much for the quantity given.  When it came time for dessert, the waitress explained they are all homemade.  I had several questions, which she patiently answered and described in further detail the desserts I asked about.  She also explained that each dessert is large enough to share, and they also have "half sizes" not listed on the menu.  I decided to share the Chocolate Fudge cake, which was heavenly.  The other person in my group had the Key Lime Pie, which was not a portion large enough to share, but was described by them as the best they've ever had.  I was thrilled with this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.
Been awhile since I've been here, but I just remember the burger with white cheddar being fabulous! Unfortunately the last time I came I wasn't able to order one since they had sold out for the day): Just goes to show how delicious they are.
Went on saturday evening with family.  Frankly, was disappointed.  Service was slow.  Food was ok, but I've had way better for the prices.  They never came to clean the crumbs off the table, never refilled our water, took the bread off the table to refill, never returned.  Filet was supposed to be midrare, came out cold and raw.  Ahi tuna was supposed to be seared, came out grey and completely unseasoned.  Gave the sides to the wrong people.  Took 20 minutes to get a beer at the table.  The wine came in reasonable time.  In short, if you want good service and great food for these prices go somewhere else.
Our waiter was probably overworked but we sat down and nobody came to get our drink order for 30 minutes. Then another 10 minute wait for the drinks and food order. Dinner was mediocre, the food didn't taste very good to me. I'm gluten free and had a lot of problems with the chef and the gluten free cookie they have. I'm pretty sure there was cross contamination because today I'm feeling side effects from eating gluten. It's probably a good restaurant on a day where they aren't super busy but our service was awful. I suggested this place because of the reviews and I was sorely disappointed.
Had stone crabs of course and oysters on the half shell.  The oysters were so smooth and chewy.  Service could have been better, however they were super crowded.  My husband had a filet and was very pleased.  I had Joe's scallops and they were quite good as well.
It's getting better each time.  Way to go Joe's!. . June 9th.  I wanted the surf and turf with the bone in filet rather than the petite and king crab legs instead of lobster.  No problem!. . The steak (m-r) was tender, tasty and indeed 16oz.  It was not the very best I've had, that distinction is firmly held by Kinzie Chophouse in Chicago.  But this was very, very good. (A-).  The king crab was also great.  Expertly cracked, plentiful and served with drawn butter. (Also an A-).  We had onion strings as a side.  OK, but I recommend something else. (C).. . My wife had the fish tacos and they were very good. (A-).. . We were seated immediately without reservations, so no issue there and our server was attentive and very helpful in getting me the off the menu combo I wanted. (A).
We enjoyed a great Fathers Day lunch...love the sliced steak sandwich with fries...added sauteed Broccolini & ended with Blueberry Pie...AWESOME!
Our family of 7 went her Friday night to celebrate a birthday. The food was excellent. We had calamari and spinach stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. They both were excellent. The steaks had excellent seasoning and flavor. My steak was one of the best steaks I have ever had before. I highly recommend Joe's to anyone that likes great food and service. Our waitress was outstanding. She was friendly, helpful, and attentive.
Delicious and fresh. I've only eaten here once for lunch, but the food couldn't have been better. Great service , too.
Disappointed. . We have been eating at Joe's for years, and it's always been one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas due to the excellent food and service.  My husband proposed to me there in 2010.  We went there last week (on the 4th anniversary of our engagement).  My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said "tell your waiter" (which we did).. We arrived at 7 p.m.   We were rushed to order.  Our food arrived within 5 minutes (we were having cold crab legs and hot sides).  It was faster than McDonalds.  We were never asked if we would like coffee or dessert and the anniversary of our engagement was totally forgotten.  We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m. 30 minutes after sitting down.  There were many empty tables, so the rush was very weird. Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.  Won't be back any time soon
Joe's is one of the best seafood spots in Las Vegas. Starting with the bread basket and ending with the desert, everything was excellent. The lobster was huge and the server cracks it open for you. The bone-in filet was awesome and I was not expecting a steak this good at a seafood place. The claws, tails, and crab legs were also top notch. The servers are very friendly, as is the staff at the door. Overall great experience. You must go here if you enjoy seafood.. . They also have private rooms if you want to bring a large group there. I was recently there for a bachelor party and it was a very nice set up.
Chilean sea bass is hands down the best I have everhad , the king crab didn't disappoint , make sure you get it cold not warmed it's different but great , everyone's desserts were fantastic , banana creme pie , blueberry pie , and key lime pie !!. . If you make reservations and sit in the back restaurant you want the older server named john , fantastic server and gives you that old Vegas feel !!
oh my gosh i love their stone crab claws, it is so fresh you can taste the sweetness from the crab meat, and we ordered the raw oysters, they have different type of oysters but now i can't remember their name, but must try the smaller one, oh my gosh you will feel like you have taste the heaven, i always though that big oyster is the best, not until the waitress recommended me to try the smaller size one, and realize they are actually the best!!! i love their clam chowder, and i love their chilean sea bass.   there's many more dishes i would like try, but since i live in L.A., when i have a chance to be there, my top choices are still their stone crab claws and oyster :)
HORRIBLE!! Made reservations here for 7:00 3 weeks ago for my 21st birthday dinner. Called the restaurant to verify our reservations and the hostess confirmed us for 7:00. Arrived at 7:00 to an extremely RUDE maitre d' named Tim who told us our reservations were at 6:30 not 7:00 even after we told him we confirmed earlier. He rudely told our party of 10 we would have to wait. After waiting for about 30 minutes and the employees making absolutely no acknowledgement of their mistake our party decided to leave. I find it unbelievable that the maitre d' did not even apologize and nobody in the restaurant tried to compensate for their mistake. I would never return to a restaurant with such rude employees!
Just had my birthday dinner here and it was wonderful. They had run out of stone crab since it's not peak season, buy that did not lessen our enjoyment of our meal at all. . I ordered a selection of oysters to start and they were all delicious, my boyfriend had the crab bisque which was divine. For dinner I had the rib eye which was cooked to perfection and he had the Chilean sea bass, which was also incredible. Topped off with key lime pie and a complimentary brownie ala mode it was an fantastic dining experience and the service was great!
We went here in a pinch, after Celine Dion. We had talked about making reservations somewhere but ended up winging it. . . I've been to the Miami location and Chicago (is it even there anymore?). SO had never been. . We ordered Pacific crab claws (completely disappointed that there were no stone crab claws...why do they keep them on the menu when they don't have them?) which were pretty good with the traditional mustard sauce, the 12 oz filet medium rare and the spinach. . . The filet was the winner this night. It was cooked well and the seasoning salt that accompanies it was delicious. . . We really liked the crab claws, they were tasty. We just wished for traditional stone crab as SO had never had them before and they are so hard to come by.. . The spinach: frankly, I make better sauteed spinach at home. . . I loved that they had Albarino and Sancerre by the glass. The wine list was nice and not exorbitantly marked up like everywhere else in Vegas. . . For dessert we had peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. It was standard. . . Joes reminds me a lot of Ruths Chris but add crab and minus some of the more delicious sides like sweet potatoes. . . The service was excellent, as expected.. . All in, it was $160 for two of us, splitting the filet, crab, 1 side, 1 glass of wine, a soda and ice cream. Pretty reasonable for Vegas!. . Its a great restaurant if you aren't looking for the most favorite meal experience of your life  which you can also find in Las Vegas by just trying out your most favorite chef's restaurants. . . Great late night option after a show at Caesars.
Always a PLEASURE eating here. My husband & I live in Vegas, I've worked on the strip for MGM resorts international for 11 yrs n We Lve this place!!! Last night (6-29-14) our server was Ethani she was AWESOME! It was my husbands b-day n even though the host would not move us to a bigger booth cuz we were squished n expressing 2more might join. We were not accommodated. Even though we were staring at a 1/2 round bigger booth that never got sat r whole duration Ethani made us feel comfortablen she knew her menu. She made my husbands b-day(which was def. repaid in her tip. Thank u Ethani!
Try the Chilean Sea Bass with the miso glaze and bok choy.  It is absolutely amazing...almost divine.  I also had the BLT wedge which had two thick slices of tomato...It was probably the freshest tomato I have ever eaten.  Very sweet and perfectly firm...I could have ate the tomato by itself!. . Everything here is top notch, the service, the portions, the quality of their food.  It's a can't miss!
