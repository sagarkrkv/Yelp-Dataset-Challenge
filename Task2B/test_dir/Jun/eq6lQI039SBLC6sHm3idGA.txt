If I had 30 dollars left and I had a choice of buying a pizza pie or going to marquee, I would choose the pizza life everyday. Shoutout to the grandmas out there. . . This place is spot for a pricey oily slice of indulgent vegas goodness.
Great little hidden gem that's open when you need pizza the most. It truly is hidden without a sign, but everyone knows where it is -- just ask. . . Hangover cure. Late night snack.  After Marquee destination. . . Definitely has an old school Brooklyn style ambiance to it.
I think the cheese pizza was great.  Because of it's popularity, there's probably a high turnover, so they probably keep bringing in the hot pies.  As for the other pies sitting there,they don't have that hot out of the oven taste.  The pepper and pepperoncini pizza was not good at all.  Not as hot as the cheese, and the taste of the pepperoncini  kills that pizza taste.  So for the taste itself, one great slice of the cheese, and one horrible slice of the combo, and factoring the high price ($4.75 for the cheese and $6+ for the combo, it was a little disappointing.  Stick with the cheese slice, and you'll be happy.  It's pretty good, but I don't have that urge to go back.
A small, unadorned pizza kitchen hidden in plain sight across the elevator and down a hallway lined with album covers, Secret Pizza has some of the best pizza that I've had.  Not gourmet by any means, but just the right amount of oiliness to each slice and just the right amount of crispiness to the crust, combined with the cachet of its secretive location (even the take-out pizza boxes are plain white without any markings), all make Secret Pizza a worthwhile detour to the Cosmopolitan.  And while $4.50 per slice is generally pretty steep, it's not all that surprising considering the place is in one of the newer, luxury properties along the Las Vegas Strip.
It's in a "relatively" easy place to find. The wait times are usually super long. But it's the cheapest/best food you can probably find in Vegas. There's also a nice pool table outside, so if you come with friends, you can hang out for sometime.
The secret is out, it (sadly) seems as if everyone knows about "Secret Pizza" and the proof is in the line. It took two tries during my last visit to Vegas to get my favorite slice because both times the line was all the way down the hall. That being said, it was totally worth the wait! If you are looking for delicious, New York style pizza this is the spot. The white pizza is absolutely outstanding but I'm also a fan of the traditional cheese pizza. There aren't tables here, so be prepared to eat standing at the little bar area or take your order with you. It's great for a "quick" (depending on the line situation) lunch or late night bite!
This place is amazing!! Go to the 3rd floor. There's a small hallway with vinyls on the wall. Go in deep. You'll find the MOST incredible pizza!!!. . Get the white pizza.  It looks like there's nothing on it. Or you might look at it and think it's too much cheese.  Dont think about it, just order the damn slice. Ask for it to be toasted just a bit longer.  It'll be a slice of heaven.  Promise.. . Oh and the parmasean cheese in the jars on the counter? Add that. It's not the traditional cheese powder,  this one tastes fresher and isn't as dried.  Oh and that green spice jar next to the cheese jar?  Shake a bunch of it on your white pizza.  You'll die of happiness.
An hour wait for a whole pie? Sorry, not worth it at 3:24 a.m. . . *I'll up my review to 4 stars if someone gives me a free slice RIGHT NOW. . . Also, drunk chicks are THE WORST.
I don't know exactly why I like this pizza so much.  I thought maybe it was psychological, because of the pseudo-"exclusive" nature of a place called "Secret" Pizza, and maybe the retro-80's pizza joint setup, complete with checkered pattern, a Galaga arcade cabinet, and pinball machines.  So I took some pizza with me back to Cali for lunch on the next day.  Also made sure to call up SP to find out the temperature to reheat my slices (450 degrees F).  Even reheated in the toaster oven, the slices were still really great.  Just taking a wild guess that maybe they put olive oil in the dough?  . . The only down note I'd have to give this place is the price for a slice ($5 is on the pricey side).  It's not out of line considering the location of this place, but I guess the fair value of a slice of NY-style pizza in a casino hotel in Vegas is $5.
I went looking for this place after seeing the reviews on yelp.  You do have to look. Very good pizza.  Very friendly staff.  They recommended the white sauce with meatballs.  I was not disappointed.   Cool vibe with all the album covers on the wall.   I would go back.
Cheesy, gooey, greasy goodness!! Doesn't seem like this place is all that secret, there was a constant line going. Location is on the 3rd floor. Coming off the elevator just turn right and head through the decorated hall full of vintage Italian record art. Slices are enormousand the "pie" slices are beyond thick! I had the white pizza and it melted in my mouth so deliciously. After the marquee day pool party go fatty it up at secret pizza, you won't regret it!
Personally the hype is not real... Perhaps it was extremely over-hyped up, maybe it was because I 100% sober haha. Idk it wasn't worth $28.50 for a pepperoni pizza. I live in Vegas and if you live here or visit I still think Verrazano Pizza and Rocco's Pizza are the best and waaay cheaper. . We got the traditional pepperoni pizza and maybe that was my mistake because I hate salami pepperoni. If I happen to ever go back, I will try one slice of the raved white pizza. . The price at Secret Pizza is RIDICULOUS... but what do you expect??? Vegas + Drunk people = Strip prices
A little hard to find but definitely worth it. The white cheese was awesome! One of the best pizza ive had in vegas.
Pizza was good but the draw of this place is that it has no name, no menu, no pricing, is tucked away in a corner down a hallway, and simply serves slices of pizza on paper plates and beer or soda in solo cups. So simple. So perfect. Caters perfectly to the needs of the club goers at the cosmo looking to satisfy their late night munchies.
The wait was about 30 minutes for this place on a Saturday night, considering that awesome late night urge to consume pizza after copious amounts of drinking and debauchery.. . My friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.. . PS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck.
This is my go to las vegas drunk spot. I've been to this place every time I've been to Vegas since that fateful day we accidentally stumbled into the eclectic hallway with records all over the wall. Seriously, I went to this place every single night the last time I was in town. The wait is always crazy...but I always leave satisfied. If you can get the pizza with sliced meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta you are lucky. Thats my favorite. You can get it with garlic too. Its probably not worth all the time I've wasted waiting in line for a slice...but its a Las Vegas staple for me and my friends. A little on the expensive side but hey, it is on the strip. I will def be back.
Found this on Yelp and said, "What the heck we should give it a try." Boy, was I happy I did! The most amazing pizza in the world! The crust is thin and crispy... Pepperoni has so much flavor... A little spice in it. We asked the concierge where this place was located and they would say because it's a secret! Loved going on a hunt for this place. Overall I totally understand why this place has amazing ratings! Tip- there isn't really much space to sit down so we lounged right outside the restaurant! Thank you Yelpers for this awesome find!
Taste: 4. Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5. Atmosphere: 3.5. Service: 4. Bang for your buck: 3. . Ahh secret pizza i remember when i first stumbled into this gem drunk roaming cosmo wondering where everyone was getting this pizza. So after many failed attempts and countless run in's with people asking where i can get a hold of this pizza i found it down a long narrow hall way. Now if you have ever been to NYC this is as close as your gonna get to NYC pizza at least in Las Vegas, simple; thin crust and very flavorful! Atmosphere is normally drunk ass people wondering around outside the 3rd floor of the cosmo; this place is hidden in the back down a long narrow hallway by all the high end restaurants very hard to find unless you ask someone and even than it took me awhile. Service is fairly quick get in, get your pizza and get out but when its the end of the night 4-5am its packed so be warned !! Overall if your on the strip craving pizza late night snack this is the place to go if you can find it haha and well it reminds me of NY
The New York in me loves Secret Pizza. It really does. It's probably the closest I'll get to having a NY slice (that doesn't mean that their pizza is spot on though!). . Why 3 stars then? Well, I went on a Tuesday at around 1:45 in the morning and stood in line for 30minutes. Not too shabby. I wouldn't say that they were extremely busy and they seemed to be well staffed too. Thing is, it was DIRTY. The parmesan, oregano, chili flakes and garlic powder was scattered all over their counter tops as if they were having a party. I don't mind dirty when you're slammed and short staffed but there was absolutely no excuse for dirtiness that night. Especially since there was an employee stuck to her phone in the corner. She didn't even TRY to crouch down so that no one could see her. . . Not to mention the fact that the guys there didn't seem too enthusiastic about being there. I know that I wouldn't want to be at work at that time in the morning but, come on. At least be a little pleasant? Anyway, if I didn't have to consider their employees they would've been a solid 4 and a half stars.. . Don't let my review scare you though. Pizza dough was crisp and the small burns that it had was still enjoyable. There was a good amount of cheese and, was perfectly melted. Pepperoni had that juicy yet still crispy feel. Their Blanca slice was OK. Nothing too special but you definitely see and taste the ricotta. . . I would definitely go back since the pizza's great. I just hope they step up their customer service.
It's good pizza.
My husband and I proclaimed to our friends that we were starving around midnight on a Wednesday while playing in Cosmo. So our friend tells us to go to the 3rd floor (it is the third floor, right?), walk passed the pool table, down a long hallway to get the BEST PIZZA.. . I must say I was intrigued and would have never found this place on my own.. . Pizza was good. Crisp Crust, Cooked all the way through (Hey, I live in DE, where no one can commercially cook a good pizza besides a handful of places!), cheese bubbly and alittle burned (just the way I like it!).. . Surprisingly a great place to eat. Simple Food. Who would have thought you could find such a thing in Vegas!
I am guessing this place has such high scores because it a pizza place that is great if you are drunk. Actually, it's even better when your sober. I don't think you can get a better slice anywhere west of the Mississippi. Trust me I have tried. I don't really have a favorite so try what looks good to you. I promise you will like it. Only downside is the line and wait if you to get a full pie. This rates as easily on my top 5 best pizza places I have ever tasted, if you can find it.
Probably one of the best pizzas I've had so far. Had the ricotta and mazzo pizza. Thin and packed with flavor. Even though it's a bit on the pricey side, it's all worth it. The wait for a whole pie was around 15 to 20 minutes. No biggie.
The Best pizza in Vegas. Try the white one. Also beer on tap.
Wow. If you know Vegas well.. You know about the secret location to this place. The name at this location isn't "secret pizza" it doesn't have a name period. It's located at the 3rd floor of the Comsopolitian hotel!! They have different flavor pizza! You can order a whole pizza and I will be ready within 30 mins after you order it. You can't make phone orders.. From what I remember! If your at the marquee day/night club.. I recommend this place!!! A++++
Good pizza, especially late at night.  It's not the best in town, nor in the city center (the aria pizza place is better imo) but still good enough.   Call in or get in line early, because it can sometimes be over 1/2 hr wait.
Love the pizza but gave it a one star for the customer service lady at the register was rude
Great pizza for anytime of the day. . . Quick tip: . Get the pizza and hangout outside of the secret pizza spot, people will constantly ask you where the place is and you'll feel like a boss.
The concept of this place is cute. I had a hard time finding this place because the location didnt state the name of the pizza joint. It was literally a long hallway I had to walk through to realized I ended up at the "secret pizza". The pizza has a thin crust so the pizza was more on the crispier side. A slice of pizza is about $8 from what I remember ( hey it was 1 am lol). Oh... they open really late and for being in vegas... it's a hugeeee plus ! I would say this place is a novelty mainly because of it's name and the secrecy of the location.... it's on the top floor of the cosmopolitan and at the end of a long hallway... but you didn't hear that from me :x
Get there early, it lines up quick!. . This is definitely no secret anymore.  You have to be looking for it, but more people know about it these days than not.  The pizza slices are pretty fresh and a good size, however they are not out of the ordinary.  I can get this same style pizza, similar flavors, same price and quality in San Diego at over a dozen places.. . I would go again, as long as the line is not too long.  Its a good spot to check out for sure, however I don't know that it really lives up to the hype.  Its typical.
Best pizza I have had besides in Chicago or New York of course. Barely any seating , but we take it out by the billiards and sit in the cozy couches.
Finally found the secret pizza spot! The line gets long, especially after 3am when people are stumbling out of Marquee. The pizza is fresh and really good. I can eat 2 slices at most, and I'm a small girl. Get their white pizza or the sausage/pepperoni pizza. Grab a seat outside on the 3rd floor. There's always seats.
i have to come here every time i'm in Vegas because .....  white ricotta pizza.  white ricotta pizza.  white ricotta pizza.  white ricotta pizza.  white ricotta pizza.  white ricotta pizza. SOO GOOOD.. . if you don't have time to pick up pizza later again during your trip, order a whole! Cost/Time efficient :)
Two words, White. Pizza!  I strongly recommend that after your drunken fun at Marquee, you hit up this secret pizza spot.  The white pizza has three or four different types of cheeses and is smothered with roasted garlic spread.  Nothing can top this for post drinking nomz.  The only downfall is that they don't have different sizes to their pies that can be ordered.  A whole pie is 28".  Which was enough to feed three guys and still have leftovers for two others.  This is a must have when in Vegas.  Run, don't walk!
I. LOVE. PIZZA. . This place never disappoints.  They're fast, it's cheap, and it's open until 5AM--awesome.  . . I've been here a few times, but I'll write about my experience last night.  My cousin and I were out on the town, having drinks, and people watching on the Strip.  At around 4:00am, the munchies started to kick in lol--I thought of this place! OMG, the line was crazy long.  Marquee had just closed, and a bunch of drunken kiddoes singing EDM songs filled the long hallway that lead to the pizza.  So my suggestion is to go there before the club closes avoid the lines, buy a fresh pie (~$28; ~$5/slice) and a cold beer, and take it to the couches outside of the restaurant and JUST. GRUB.  It's the perfect way to end (or start) a night ;)
While the novelty of getting a Sicilian or thin crust slice at 4:00am is great, this place is a bit pricy. The NY style (thin crust) was my favorite of the two. Food is GOOD!. There is no where to sit in the small place. There is some seating out by the pool table just outside of the record album hall you go through to find this place. FYI it's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. I didn't see any signage for the place while walking through the casino. After all it is TOP SECRET.
Secret Pizza, Ratchet Pizza...Tomato, Tomahto. . . For a place deemed to be a secret, it sure had a ridiculous long line of sunburned drunkies with the munchies. Not surprising, being in Vegas and all, but man, that place was dirty. There were only two workers manning the fort, so I guess cleaning their oily, crumby countertops wasn't a priority.. . I don't know if their pizza was mouthwatering by its nature or because I just stumbled my way from Marquee Day Club. Regardless, I remember my mushroom pepperoni slice being crispy with a gooey satisfaction. Not too satisfying though, to be worth $5. I really wanted to try the white pizza that every yelper seems to rave about, but they only had three selections available: pepperoni, mushroom pepperoni, and sausage pepperoncini. It would have been a sad sad day for any herbivore.
I haven't had pizza in the longest time ever because my diet's pretty low carb, but in vegas it completely went out the window! Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :). . Normally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!. . I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.. . FYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.. . -It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem!. -It's more of a go in & grab a quick slice place, there aren't chairs for you to sit
