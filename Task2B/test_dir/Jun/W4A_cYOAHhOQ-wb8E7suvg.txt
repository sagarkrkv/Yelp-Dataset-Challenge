Great show, 75 min went by so fast... very entertaining
My husband and I decided to watch this because of all the great reviews, but that was the biggest mistake we ever made!! Granted, there are no bad seats, you have a great view from anywhere, but that's about the only positive I can think of. I literally wanted to walk out in the middle of it. There was nothing special about it...the dancing was laughable andguys with light-colored wet tights leave little to the imagination.  Waste of time and money.
Hubs and I have been wanting to see O for a while, but people said that Le Reve was a better show. Listening to the advice of others, we decided to catch this show on our recent trip to Vegas. I purchased tickets online to avoid the hassle. Sure I could've bought tickets from those booths on the strip but that involved getting up early and waiting online, and not knowing what the price of the day would be. Better safe than sorry! . . The show is at the Wynn and if you've never been inside that hotel, you must! It's beautiful and clean. . . First of all, this is "NOT" a Cirque du Soleil show but it was written and produced by an the same person who did O. . . We were in the 2nd row from the stage, Yes, that's the splash zone. I was worried that we would get splashed, but after reading some reviews on Yelp it didn't seem that bad. Now I can come back an testify my experience. Note, at the beginning before the show starts they have a fogger/mister running so it's quite humid but not like a rain forest. During the show I got splashed like 2 times by a performer getting in/out of the water but nothing that ruined my clothes. . . I would definitely get those splash zone seats again because I enjoy being close to the stage to see the performers faces and those tickets are the cheapest! . . About the show, it has everything! Acrobatics, dancing, magic, comedy, a story line I could follow, and hot men! They also allow you to take photos during the show which is nice. Just remember to turn off flash.
One of my top two shows in Vegas. Great theatre, incredible cast and a wonderful production.  A treat for the eye!
Seriously one of the best shows in Vegas!  As a Las Vegas local I've seen countless shows on the strip and throughout the city and Le Reve is hands down my favorite!  . The Various artistic elements they use add so many layers of depth to the show, from aerial acrobatics, water performances, dancing and music as well as an interesting story line to the show, make this my favorite show in the city. I always recommend friends and visitors to see Le Reve!
This is by far THE best show I have ever seen in my life! There is so much going on in all directions of the stage, you don't know where to look at! The performers appear from under water , the ceiling, the stairways, etc. Lighting is beautiful and all the stunts and performances really do make you feel like you are dreaming... It is a pricey show but after you go see it, you will understand why. I've seen this show once and I already want to go see it again. If I could give it more stars I would! MUST SEE SHOW!
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #148 - #365. . When I first saw Le Reve - The Dream back in 2007,  it was one of the best shows I've seen with Mama Mia being the second. I recently when back to watch Le Reve with my friend Ian and heard that SteveWynn made a few changes here and there. Since he bought the rights to Le Reve, he has gone into a tweaking frenzy with Le Reve. He also likes to make frequent changes to his resorts Wynn and Encore.. . But anyways, the best seats are in the middle of the venue with the cheap seats being in the splash zone and the VIP seats located in the top features a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a screen showing the back stage of the show. . . This show is amazing and a sight to see if you're into the Cirque type of shows with the acrobats and story telling. I noticed throughout the show, they have way more dancing the before and less action. The entire set is designed like no other stage in Vegas with mostly water all around you. . . So get ready to watch a show full of chiseled abs, synchronized swimmers, lots of dancing, the tree scene and water raining down from the ceiling. I prefer Le Reve when it first started and now it's just dancing!
This was my second Cirque Du Soleil show and kind of already had an idea of how I expected it to be. Let me tell you, it was not how I expected.. . This show had a lot more dancing, choreography and dramatic theatrics than I expected. From the very beginning, the show was intense in terms of the dancing and music. There are definitely less acrobatics than O, and since this show has a storyline, it centers around the story/dramatics more than flips and gymnastics stunts. It's not to say that there are none, but less frequent and less intense aerobic stunts than O.. . This story is about love, fear, good, bad, and inner conflict. There were some acts that were very clear in their theme, and some that were not. Overall, the story was a little hard to follow but you get the gist of it at the end. I think the creators just wanted to include as many relevant themes as possible in a 1.5 hour show. . . I really enjoyed the magic and live doves used in this show. So unexpected and mind blowing!. . The seating in this theater is arranged in a circle with the stage in the center, so really any seat you get will be a good seat. Be aware though, that the first couple of rows in the front will get splashed slightly when the performers get lifted into the air and/or flip their wet hair around. . . All in all, I liked this show but I don't think it's 'the best' Cirque Du Soleil show in Vegas.
Amazing choreography, costumes, etc - just plain impressive too. The stage/pool is in the round and the seating is very vertical so I can't imagine there's a bad seat in the house. Great for my 9-year-old kid, who proclaimed it the Best. Show. Ever. (And this is a kid who got her classmates to practice Wicked for 5 months on the playground, because she was so obsessed - hope she doesn't try to duplicate this stuff!). . I saw "O" at the Bellagio about 12 years ago, so a direct comparison is tough, but I'd say this is pretty close if not better.
