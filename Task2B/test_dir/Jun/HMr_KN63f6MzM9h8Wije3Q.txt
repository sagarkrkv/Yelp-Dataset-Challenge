Stayed here for 5 nights with a group of friends. They were able to put our rooms close together so it was very convenient. . . This is a great middle of the road priced hotel. The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfy. There is a wide variety of stuff to do in the hotel and it is a great location if you want to do stuff at that end of the strip. . . I didn't use the gym but my friends did and it wasn't anything special but met their needs.. . My girlfriend also recently stayed here and used the spa. She says it is overpriced for what you get. The spa at the venetian was a similar or cheaper price and had many more amenities.. . It is also convenient in that it is close to the airport and the parking is also easy to access.. . The wi-fi is also included which is a plus.
I hate to admit it, but  I've lived in (the real) NY for over half a century.  I even had 2 children in Manhattan.  I have been uptown, midtown and downtown and have a real sense of NYC. . The indoor mall in Vegas, gives you a sense of the downtown area of Manhattan and it was nice.  Upstairs was a roller coaster,  which we did not go on.  The Brooklyn Bridge was built, but taped off. There was a Pizza Restaurant there, I cannot recall the name, but their pizza was clearly forgettable, don't order it.  We bought a hat at one of the street vendors, but after being in Paris, this was truly a disappointment.  I would not recommend this as a site seeing destination.
Good visit - good staff.. . Fluid flow of arrival to room to casino & eateries.. . I enjoy a good craps game . . . Perhaps not highly recommended here just do to the lack of reminders to new players of table etiquette ( seems more like they need players over experienced players ). . Poker room - again go elsewhere . . . Just no to little game here. . Blackjack - play here ( roulette was also good ) . . . $ 5 blackjack & clean tables . . . Pluses. . Rooms are comfy - staff accommodating - good location. . Would return - given the competitive nature of the casino's needing customers it does reflect the stay was better than expected
I was there for a convention and had a very bad experience.The room was so dirty I couldnt believe it, there were hair all over the bed spread and dust all over the room.The bathroom had no ventilation and the room had the smell of sewer at all times.I dont get it the hotel was built only eigtheen years ago not fifty years ago how can there be no ventilation in the bathroom.. There a few good things there the black gentelman who is called the Sax man was great,the hotdog place and the shower head.. I will never go there to this motel like place again.
We really enjoyed our stay here.  We had the basic room.  It was comfortable, attractive and well laid out.  The shower was powerful.  Bathroom make up mirror with lights was a plus.   Everything was clean and well taken care of.  We will be back.
Checked in on a Friday afternoon for a one night visit. . . Pros: . early checkin was FREE before 1. Comfy clean beds. Not too fluffy pillows. . Good location. Lots of dining choices. SO many places to drink beer. Nice view from strip view room. Pool was fun. Good AC. Roller coaster . $50 beverage credit! How did I get that??. . Cons:. Shade at the pool comes w/ a cost. . Longest hallways ever. Good luck finding your room if you're drunk. . The non-stop flushing of our toilet. Had to jiggle the little ballcock (hehe) thing every flush so basin would fill. Eww. . No mall type place like Caesars or PH
Hotel room was nice and clean. Staff was friendly. Check-in was fairly simple. Used MyVegas Rewards so our cost was low. Housekeeping was respectful of our do not disturb sign. . Paid a fee for amenities which included wi-fi. It was slow and often did not work so the fee went to nothing we used basically.
In a word? Disgusting.. . They allow prostitution and move you when the "activity" in the room next to you becomes "excessive."  . Long story short: I was in Vegas for 737 training and had to be in the simulator at 0630.  The "activity" in the room next door was obvious and at decibels.  Phoned security twice and they told me to my face that "there is nothing about the behavior in the room that should concern you, however we're going to move you.". At 2:30AM the valet arrived and I was moved. . . Done. Never again.
No. Just... No. . . Yes, the free wifi rules (with a $20 resort fee per night) and yes the dueling pianos are awesome ($5 cover just to stand inside, $15 if you want to sit...) but the pool is minuscule & has NO SUN (!!) until noon, there's very little people cruising the strip on this side, the food is mediocre and their customer service sucks. Hard.. . At 6:45am the morning after we checked in a strange man walked into our room, using a key & turned on the lights. We are two ladies passed out after a long day of getting to Vegas & had the hell scared out of us. Probably scared him, too. . . I call to front desk, obviously very upset & confused and she tries blaming it on me saying it either didn't happen or we must have left our door open & he randomly walked in!!! She checks the computer saying no other keys have been made for our room & insists it was our fault. Then she suddenly puts me on hold for 5 minutes because he came back down to the front desk saying exactly what I said. . . She offers no apologies, no making it up to us, just says it rarely happens & we can get a new key programmed. Like that makes a difference. Wow. When I ask to speak to a manager, she says she is one. When we ask for a room she says we have to wait until 9am to see if there is anything available. I ask if she'll be on at that time and no... I get to explain this all to a new manager. . . Very very very unhappy with New York New York.
Me and NY-NY, I don't know.  It just wasn't as smooth as it should have been or as smoothas pretty much anyplace else I've stayed in Vegas.  The keys stopped working because they didn't program them correctly.  The wifi's download speed ranged from 0.14 to 0.36 mbps, which is sort of useless.  The cable TV went out one night and they blamed the cable company for that.  The alarm clock was so weird that I had to download the manual to learn how to set the alarm.  After 3PM no one works in the business center but when you call, a message says someone will call you back even though no one is there.  And the room could have been cleaner.  There were empty shampoo bottles in the bathroom and garbage behind the nightstand.  The good news is that there were no bedbugs.. . I'll stay somewhere else next time.
Clean rooms. Good selection of food & stores. Convenient location. Nice amenities. Quick elevators. Loved the Zumanity show. No complaints other than the smell of smoke (which is in all Vegas casinos) & lack of drink servers on the casino floor. Would stay again.
Excellent place to stay, especially for the money. Booked on Priceline for about $60 a night. We were very pleased with our spacious and comfortable room. We had a great view looking toward the western mountains. Our room was clean and well appointed. I would have liked to see a microwave in the room or at least a refrigerator but there was an ice machine. The beds were super comfy.
For all it could be, I feel the New York - New York is completely hit and miss.  As for entertainment, food, and hotel, it's pretty good compared to other casinos on the strip.  As for casino play, I feel it just falls flat compared to others.  I've stayed here before and was impressed with the hotel features.  I've seen Zumanity and have eaten at a couple of their restaurants and liked those as well.  But in the end, it didn't seem as alive as other casinos and for that, I'd say it's A-OK!  Not a place I need to go to each time I'm in town, but worth going to if you're in a casino hoping mood.
Good place to stay if one has m life account. Pool is whatever however awesome pizza and now hershey candy store in premises!
I stayed here overnight as a flight home wasn't available until the next morning.. . With that, this review is specifically about the front desk person and my room.  I didn't utilize any of the many restaurants, food areas, games, etc..... . The front desk person was incredibly nice and super understanding when I explained I wasn't there for the "Vegas" experience.  I just wanted a quiet (quiet enough) room.  . . The room I was in overlooked the roller coaster which was fine.  I heard it and the screams of people for a while.  The alarm clock has a nice sound effect feature.  I turned up the ocean waves to block out the outside noise and all was well.  Otherwise it was a standard room.  It was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was fine.  . . Overall, I had an "a-ok" stop over on my way home.
This hotel charges $22.50 each day for a resort fee even though you don't use the gym or the pool. Their player, comp benefits are terrible. I played for approximately 4 to 5 hours and most of the time it was at the maximum coin-in level. When I went to the booth to try to get a comp slip for a meal they said I only accumulated $10.59.
Now this is probably my favorite Las Vegas hotel. I know I'm going to get lots of hate from "true New Yorkers," but NYNY Is the hippest hotel on the Strip!!!. . Pros:. -Home to Zumanity, the "Erotic Side of Cirque du Soleil": go as a couple, go with a group of girlfriends, hell, even go with your bros. This is the young, sexy show you can't miss. Yes, some call it a little "risque," but in my opinion, it's a tasteful topless show paired with stunning acrobatics. Hello, girls dancing in a large bowl, anyone? Or the sexy Antonio the Gigolo? Or what about the lovely drag queen host. College kids, please please please see this show so those awkward families finally GET A CLUE.. . -Home to the NYNY Rollercoaster: I've never been on because I'm a wimp, but it's definitely something that's attracted all my friends. And if you're not a coaster daredevil, go play in the upstairs arcade while your friends scream their heads off.. . -Home to America: Such a lovely restaurant to get brunch or lunch. Locals: 10% OFF!!!! Not that's a steal for locals on the Strip. I love their poached salmon and eggs, and their cocktails are pretty "inexpensive" for the Strip ($12). Also, grab a cronut or choose from their wide selection of donuts for an afternoon delight.. . -Home to Coyote Ugly:Opens after 6 pm...did I TELL YOU NYNY was the youngest, hippest feeling hotel? . . -Or if Irish is more your speed, head on over to Nine Fine Irishmen. . There's plenty of other restaurants and bars. My friend and I were catching Zumanity and we saw all these dancers giving a performance on top of Poker tables...wild.. . There's a few specialty shops, including Stupidiotic, I LOVE NEW YORK, Swatch, Starbucks, etc.. . It's unique because it's one of the hotels that feels light "night" even during the day. There's also a Banksy-esque mural by the quick eats places and plenty of other things reminiscent of New York.. . Finally, I know that many college age or 20 somethings will complain that NYNY doesn't have a major nightclub, or any nightclub for that matter, but with this amount of energy, would you even need one? Save the clubbing for amateurs, and just enjoy a slice of the 2nd best city in the best city.
The parking structure is filthy, dirty gross. Don't wear your nice shoes. Wear rubber boots over them cause you're walking thru shit.. . That's why I like Bellagio and Wynn the best. He cleans the parking structure.. . The beds are great. Room is small. Wifi is a little slow. I had to call the tech to log me on.
Perhaps I stayed too long.... Was recently at NYNY for 9 nights for work reasons and figured any of the big name hotels on the Strip would be just fine.  Sadly, by the end of my stay I had a little collection of less than favorable remarks for my Yelp entry, not the least of which was the fact that they didn't change the sheets on the bed until I left a note with an arrow pointing at what looked like some previous guest's dried nosebleed stain that the maid was I guess trying to ignore - Ewww.  On to better topics.. their premiere steakhouse.  On my first night, I sat at the bar and ordered a wedge salad, glass of Cabernet, and a filet. The wine and salad were fine, but the steak was so overdone that when the bartender came to ask how it was, she answered her own question by saying "oh that's embarrassing."  She had the host come and take the hockey puck away.  When the host brought a new one he said it was the least they could do because after all, they ARE a steak house and should be able to cook a steak. Yep.  Okay, so everyone has an off night, and I figured maybe since I was sitting at the bar, they didn't make their best presentation... several nights later, I thought I'd give it another try.  Came back to hotel from work, stopped at hostess stand and made a reservation for a couple hrs later and requested to dine this time at a small table - went and worked-out, showered, got dressed for the evening and came back to start it off with a lovely dinner.  They put me all the way back in the furthest room in the darkest corner.  Not exactly the right way to make a single diner feel comfortable or ever want to come back!      No problem, because there are a few other restaurants in NYNY.. none that are spectacular, but lots of street vendor hot pretzels and pizza slices, so you at least won't starve.  My fave dining experience was the night I went to the upstairs bar at "9 Fine Irishmen".  The bartender Dave made me feel welcome, suggested a great salmon, poured a good glass of wine and made conversation - I even enjoyed the Irish band that started playing at 9pm - a really fun evening! . As far as the staff at NYNY goes, there were some interesting inconsistencies. The front desk folks, players club folks and concierge were all fantastic - accommodating, happy to assist, and competent.  The duds were at the pool and Starbucks.  The boy at the towel stand wielded his "one-towel-per-customer" policy like nobody's business.. which would've been fine if it hadn't been perfectly alright to have two towels the day before and the day after, so I don't know what his story was.. But the Starbucks ladies are not to be missed!  They are the rudest, slowest, most unenthusiastic bunch of Starbucks employees I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!  Each morning, I left my room a good 15 mins early to get down there and stand in line to watch the slow progression of guests get manhandled by these women.  Monique or Monica even told me one morning (after the players club employees had trained me to use my players club card with every purchase in the hotel to get points or comps) that she had already entered the number.. she hadn't even looked at the card, so just to entertain myself I walked over to the players club desk and inquired about whether my Starbucks purchase had registered on my card... nope.  They of course made up for her laziness (and untruthfulness) and gave me credit for the purchase.  So if you want to feel like Piper Chapman in an episode of "Orange is the New Black" standing in the food line in prison, make sure to stop by the Starbucks each morning during your stay at New York New York!
Maybe I'm being a little too harsh because the first time I stayed in Venetian, and that was a godly awesome hotel. This one isn't bad, but...I definitely enjoyed Venetian more (and I believe this place was only $50 less or so).. . I liked this hotel in terms of accessibility. Compared to Venetian, this is the heart of The Strip. Since we depended on public transit, we wanted a hotel close to the express stops, and this was one of them. This hotel is also close to the airport express route, so I didn't need to transfer at South Strip (or takeone of those unreliable hotel shuttles). I also liked the whole "New York" feel, but I only really felt it in the main floor, with the whole Little Italy/Greenwich Village feel.. . The rooms, for the price we paid, were decent at best. I can't complain much considering the beds were very comfy and everything went relatively smoothly in terms of checking in and out, and they even offer complimentary computer access for boarding pass printings! However the rooms were only about 40% the size of the Venetian rooms, and for $50 less I somewhat rather pay a bit more for a larger hotel.. . The wifi was also quite weak sometimes. Without the ethernet plug, the speed felt like dialup at most times.. . hotels.com is your friend when searching for Vegas hotels. Honestly most are the same, but this hotel is good for what its worth.
When I stayed here my room was much cleaner and much less inexpensive than Mandalay Bay.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  My room at Mandalay Bay was dirty and the elevator doesn't work probably and the escalator was broken.    Did not have any problems at New York New York.  I watched the Zumanity Show here.  Nice theater, wasn't too crowded.
This is based on our one night of fun here at the NYNY. Service was polite but a bit slow at the front desk when checking in, but whatever, we were in Vegas!. . Instructions to the 'correct' elevator were incorrect, leading us on a wild goose chase to find the right one. The entire time, there was no one working there who was roaming the corridors for us to ask. When we finally found it and got up to the 7th floor (2nd and 3rd night of EDC), the ENTIRE path from elevator to our room (deep on the right side because the rest of the floor was booked with EDC goers) REEKED of vomit, weed, and alcohol. On top of that, the smell was strongest at 3 locations throughout the hall, one of which was near our doors. When we tried to enter the room with our keycards, our rooms could not/would not open, and we were forced to wait outside in the putrid smelling air for service to get to us. We requested to switch floors or rooms in the hopes there would be one without the smell, but were informed we would be charged to upgrade - where's the customer love?! The rooms themselves were alright - just enough to get by.. . All in all, it might've just been because of EDC that these events unfolded but when I come back to Vegas in the future, I'll be avoiding NYNY - maybe the Aria or somewhere more baller/customer friendly?
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #135 - #365. . Start spreading the news!. . I remember the old New York New York commercial playing back in the 90's when themed hotels were in. NY NY was one of my favorite hotels in Vegas back than because of the various sky scrapers, Yellow Cab Rollercoaster, fake streetscape, and the water shooting from the boats. Sadly that was removed because of the water shortage. Even the Bellagio fountains had to cut back on their shows. . . Rating this hotel resort would be some where between Monte Carlo and the Mirage. Above average is what I'd describe NY NY hotel. The casino is full of action and the drink waitresses are plentiful, if you tip them more, they'll make your drink stronger. . . I remember the Coney Island Arcade and now the rid half of it to make way for some convention space. The pool is meh, about as average as the Paris and Luxor pool. . . Rooms here are average and clean. I loved looking out to the strip from the Broadway Tower and looking towards MGM, Tropicana, Luxor, and Excalibur. Beds and furniture were clean, bathroom could use an update. Location wise, it's in the center of the south strip next to the MGM, Monte Carlo, and Excalibur. Just recently they opened Hershey World but didn't have time to try it out. . . Themed hotels are what gave Vegas it's tacky image and made it a sight to see. Now corporations are removing the facade because they think it doesn't generate enough revenue. . . NY NY will always be on my list of hotels to stay in Vegas and the price won't hurt your wallet, except for the ridiculous 'Resort Fee'.
First the bad aspects.. . Choppy and sporadic internet connection. Not bad if you surf, but terrible for streaming live radio and slow for all other uses. Internet is charged in the Resort Fee. RF is about $21. per night so this is not free or comped, though many guests never use it. I record radio shows and had problems with this connection. The connection was strong, so that was not the problem. . . Bathtub was slow to drain. My wife had to wait more than five minutes for the water to drain after my shower.. . Long walk to our room, on the floor. Because of the building layout, there is a long walk to some rooms from the elevators. . . Every day, the drapes were opened by the cleaning staff. The first day. it was 106 degrees outside and pretty hot in the room because of all the heat conduction that came through the exposed (closed) window. After that, I made a point of closing the curtains and the room stayed cool. . . Now the good points.. . Great elevator service. Six elevators that moved rapidly. Short waits and rarely crowded. . . Great hotel location. Especially for RTC local bus service,many routes on the cross street (Tropicana) and no transfer to the airport (Route WAX without a transfer). Also WAX going west on Tropicana was a quick ride to downtown Fremont Street along I-15.Runs about every twenty minutes, with times posted and kept to its schedule, while I was using the route.   . . Fabulous Times Square Bar with two piano players. Great party every night. Be sure to request Piano Man, it fits this bar perfectly. . . Also, across Tropicana Ave. is a free monorail that stops at the three casinos south of Tropicana. Mandalay Bay has one of my favorite buffets. (Careful it is not cheap).
Me and a group of friends just recently had the BEST experience here last week (EDC weekend). Saturday morning in particular at the pool, the staff was the absolute best....Eddie I believe? Great guy, he defenetly made our weekend after dealing with a small problem we had.  They defenetly know how to treat their guest with the best service!
The rooms are nice enough, but were very warm, and no lock on the bathroom door. It beats me why anyone would want to stay here or anywhere near this part of The Strip. Congested and the prices suck for everything! The internet stinks here too. Then these greedy jerks charge you 20 dollars a night plus tax for it. The casino itself stinks too! Terrible paying machines, and not a good variety. Do yourself a favor and stay downtown or a casino a little ways away from The Strip.
This review is solely for the casino, not the hotel (have never stayed there), the restaurants (Sporting House is good, haven't been to anything else), or anything else on the property.. . I have what can only be considered a horror story from today. I was playing $5 blackjack, and a girl who hadn't played before asked what she should do in a hand. The dealer (who I will not name out of respect for his/her job) was no help, so I gave her advice. Suddenly, said dealer accuses me of "telling my players what to do.". . There are a plethora of issues with that statement. For one, I did NOT tell my fellow player what to do. She asked for advice, the dealer refused to give her any, and I helped her by explaining a particular aspect of basic blackjack strategy, as thousands of low-limit blackjack players do every single day across the country in casinos like this one. Secondly, since when do blackjack players belong to a dealer? I object heavily to the insinuation that I, or anyone else at the table, belonged to the dealer in any capacity. Thirdly, it's a $5 table, and a friendly one, not some high-roller table in the back. Relax, for crying out loud. Dealers are supposed to promote a good gambling atmosphere where guests have fun, and this one went out of his/her way to destroy said atmosphere.. . I left New York New York today for the last time and will not wager any of my money there again. There are other places in town that actually put a priority on their guests having good experiences. I'll be spending my money at THOSE places from this point forward.
