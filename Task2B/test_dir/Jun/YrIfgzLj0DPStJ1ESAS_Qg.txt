The food is phenomenal and the flavor is beyond excellent.. Hot n juicy all the way bay bay
Went to HnJ near Decataur for lunch on May29, 2014.  Coming from Hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in LV that we like to try.  We last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to HnJ (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central C-Town).. I guess you can say that my wife and I are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  We lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  So in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'Hot n Juicy' sauce, medium hot.  Add to that two potatoes and two corn and one bowl of rice.  Talk about plenty of food for two people!?  Our server was Joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  Joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever.. Wife ordered a coke and I ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  In good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  This was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, I don't think that I can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  I would definitely order that again.  My wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  As you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  Also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  Definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. For us on this visit the food was definitely five stars.. But I must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  There was another female server and one male server - and I can't help but observe people when I'm out dining.  They both were like our server Joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your HnJ meal a great experience - great food and great service.  We've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day HnJ was tops.
Whoa. Just whoa. I had lunch with a friend here and my stomach was feeling a little funky to begin with. First mistake. . . Service was really neglectful. We had to ask to get our beverage refilled 4 times (we actually only got one refill). Also, we didn't get gloves and it was impossible to flag down someone. . . The "hot and juicy" sauce is disgusting. It's ok (thought kinda overwhelming) going down and horrendous when you're REEKING of it for two days after. That's NOT how Louisianians eat their crawfish.   The only reason this place didn't get a 1 is because of the peel-and-eat shrimp. They were fantastic and reasonably priced.  If I ever go back, I know not to expect much for the service, order two drinks from the beginning, ditch the sauce and get only shrimp.
Disappointing.  The hot and juicy blend was very diluted. Had no flavors what's so ever.
Well I have been hearing about this place and I usually go to the Boiling Crab but decided to come here to see what the hype was all about. First off I should give 3 stars for the service because it could have been better...but they were friendly and apologized about it. . . The food on the other hand was great!! I ordered 4 pounds of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, and dozen oysters. The only complaint was that the oysters were some of the smallest I have seen recently. There are a few sauce options when ordering the crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and crab. I ordered mild with everything mixed together. It was really good. I love crawfish and sometime if they are not cooked right its difficult to peel and these were not they were perfect. . . They played dope music...well according to my liking it was old school hip hop and R&B. All in all had a good experience and would definitely come back!
I love the food in this place I've been here 3 times. But all 3 times servers was terrible. Food was great the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of my servers. Last time I went we ordered rice and it took 45 minutes for the rice to finally be served on our table and everyone else got theirs, we spoke to 3 servers to get a rice. A simple rice. And when we order our servers never seem to pay Attention.
Yummy!!!!!!! I loceeeee thier hot n juicy sauce with their boil shrimp it's so good and so spicy!!! I'm not really big on crawfish at all so I never really eat it or order it when I go there.
Great service and great food. Very friendly even after the volume of people they deal with on a daily basis. Pro's
I was in Vegas with some buddies this past weekend and made it out to Hot N Juicy.  I got a pound of snow crab, pound of shrimp, corn, and potatoes in the hot n juicy medium sauce.  Everything is fairly priced and cooked to perfection.  The sauce is super tasty.  I don't think you can ask for much more.  Ditch the strip and get out to this gem.
I've been looking for a good crawfish spot in LV. This location is small with a small parking lot so come early! .  . I came around 1 or 2 pm and was greeted by a friendly, fresh faced girl who sat us right away. They didn't put our bibs on for us unlike a lot of places. (it gets kind of uncomfortable having a grown adult help you with your napkin ) they offered gloves to avoid the garlic smell stained to your hands for days!. .  We ordered a pound of King Crab and a pound of shrimp with medium hot n juicy sauce. I would say the medium sauce is definitely on the mild sauce so I would go higher if you like a nice kick. The crab was good but one leg seemed like it had been cooking a little too long. The shrimp were big and fresh. . . All in all, this place did well and I will be returning
Wife and had the shrimp and king crab legs....SO good! Gives boling crab a run for their money! The music that they play is awesome too. This will definitely be one of our must-do's every time we go to Vegas.
Fun place to try out. I found the shrimp was a lot better than the crawfish. You just don't get enough meat from the crawfish. Overall the food wasn't really my cup of tea.
Sooo good. First time eating at a Hot N Juicy and must say I will def be coming back. Service is a bit slow, but the food makes it worth it. We ordered the hot n juicy mild seasoning on the crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs and it was delicious. Mild was a bit spicy so I wouldn't go spicier than that.
