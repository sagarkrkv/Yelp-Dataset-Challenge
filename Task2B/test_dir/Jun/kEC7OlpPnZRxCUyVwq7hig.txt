This time around, since we were in Vegas to see Guns n Roses at the Joint, we just decided to stay at the Hard Rock. We have never stayed, but been in the Casino and all and really loved the vibe. I do like the small Casino, the Joint, Vinyl and many of the restaurants, but the rooms are only so-so.  . . First, let me note that I did use miles to get a free room (Casino Tower - King Size Bed).  Nothing too fancy, just your basic room.  We were offered a $25/night upgrade for Queen size bed with a pool view (which didn't seem like much of an upgrade) or a suite in the tower for $50/night (that was a better room, but since we were in for long nights a suite didn't seem worth the money). So we declined the upgrades and got our booked room.  We did arrive early, but the room was not ready and was not available until 3p.  No biggie. We pre-registered (so we could just pick up keys) and they texted us when theroom was ready (which was right on time). . . When we got to the room, it was nicely decorated, if not basic.  Big King bed,  good size TV, chair and a simple bathroom (shower/tub combo, single sink and toilet).  We had a view of the roof with all the A/C units (had to be the worst view in the place).  . . The good: . - Spacious room. - Very comfortable bed. - Was actually very quiet. - Decent size TV with lots of channels. . The bad: . - The cable on the TV went out several times and many channels just didn't come in at all.. - The bathroom smelled like rotten eggs or a sewer (GROSS), looked cleaned smelled terrible. . - The shower had a nice rain shower head, but the drain backed up and couldn't keep up, so you ended up standing in ankle deep water during the shower.  . - Housekeeping was in the room next to us when we left at 11a, but knocked at our door at 5p to clean (after we had come back and were in for a nap), really annoying. We just got towels and they never came back, no maid service while there.  . . So in short, the bad outweighed the good.  We weren't there long so it wasn't a terrible stay, we were out so much it didn't matter.  Still one would think they could get their sewer system and housekeeping in order, that isn't asking much.  I am not sure I would stay again. I certainly wouldn't stay in the Casino Tower.  The rooms definitely lacked, but the Hard Rock itself is fun!
The good;. 1.  Atmosphere is great.  Music is great on the casino floor.  Has all of your basic casino tables and slot machines you would want.. 2.  The rooms are big and nice.  I stayed in the HRH tower with a couple of friends and there was plenty of room, 2 beds and a couch which I was able to use as a third bed and it was comfortable.. 3.  Pool is nice and has beverage waitresses.. 4.  Guns and Roses concert was amazing.  Any concert there should be really good.. . The bad;. 1.  Its not actually on the strip its a few blocks away so you will have to walk or drive to the strip and park in one of the other casino's parking garages.  On Friday night we got stuck trying to get out of the parking garage for an hour because of traffic.. 2.  I was quoted one price when I booked online.  When I got there it was about $150 more because resort fees and taxes were not included.  Was not happy about this and feel it should be included in the original quoted price.
The Hard Rock Hotel is a strange beast - you get a decent enough hotel experience although the atmosphere is a bit wonky and obviously, you won't be that close to the Strip either. . . You'll be paying for a mid-tier kind of hotel and if you're not familiar with the Hard Rock Hotel brand, you'll be getting a lot of rock-and-roll references throughout the hotel.  However, when I was there the last two times, the music was a bit hit-or-miss and the room decor was a bit all over the place.  Something to be aware of.  Rooms were also a bit of a mess.  Try to stay in the newer Paradise rooms rather than the HRH basic ones.  Although the newer rooms were still a bit dark with low water pressure for the showers/sinks, at least they were bigger and more spacious than the older rooms that were even darker and cramped than the newer ones.  Additionally, the food was a bit spotty as well.  Culinary Dropout is probably your go-to-place here.  . . The entertainment is also a little bit all over.  Body English isn't what it used to be compared to the other hot nightclubs in Vegas and some of the bars are a bit hit-or-miss.  The pools in the summer are nice though with enough variety and dayclub space for partying.  The best part of Hard Rock is still probably the Joint and the adjoining musical venue.  Even though the acts themselves may be all over the place, the venue rocks out (no pun intended) with great acoustics and a terrific stage.. . And of course, the final issue is that you're not near the Strip here.  There is a daytime shuttle that has a terrible schedule of going back-and-forth so your best bet is to drive or taxi it up.  Heads-up. . . The Hard Rock Hotel is a bit hit-or-miss for me but at least has enough amenities where you'll enjoy some part of it more than others.
ATTENTION FAMILIES: Hard Rock Hotel is a decent place to vacation with your kids, but there are a few things to be aware of. Most importantly, if you plan on heavily utilizing the swimming pool, be sure to ask for a room near the Nirvana Pool. Otherwise, you will be trekking the long way through the casino floor in order to reach the sandy waters. The pools close very early and open late. My kids are swimmers and were disappointed when we had to leave the swimming pools before sundown.. . The room was nice enough, but the refrigerator was stocked full of sundries we never used. It would have been great to have someplace to store all of the leftovers from the big portions of food. It would be great, also, if the rooms did not have the obnoxious sensor-filled displays of goodies like $8 candy and $5 waters. They really ruin the chic decor of Hard Rock's hotel rooms.. . The dining at HRH was great. We ordered room service one night and it arrived fast. The next, Fu did not disappoint with Asian cuisine. Finally, Mr. Lucky's 24/7 had good eats at a decent price, but the real win was getting breakfast anytime.. . Finally, what I enjoyed most about HRH was all of the memorabilia from great musical acts. I would recommend this place, but visitors should beaware of the daily resort fee that brings up your daily room rate quite a bit if you're not expecting it.
Loved our stay! We were here for the GNR show at the Joint 6/7/14. We stayed in the Paradise Tower and it was excellent. 2 sinks, a stand up shower, huge king bed that was so comfy. Very cool decor/wallpaper. Loved the room. Room overlooked the 4 pool areas as well! Got room service for bfast and it was VERY expensive. $55 for two breakfasts and small pot of coffee. BUT, must say it was good. Casino is great. Pink Taco was decent and Mr. Luckys was packed but gave you huge portions for a good price. My husband and I are in our mid 30's. I would say this is definately a younger, 20 something crowd that hangs out here do to the pool party REHAB. Not a place for kids in my opinion. Besides the younger, crazy crowd...everything was fine. Good customer service everywhere which surprised me and not very many long lines for anything. I would stay here again for sure. Nice to get away from the crazy strip area.
- Great place for the late 20s/early 30s crowd.. - Parking is convenient, not a maze to get from car to casino/hotel.. - Main drawback is that it's off-Strip and a stand-alone major casino in its area whereas the Flamingo off-Strip cluster has Palms & Rio (and the minor casino Gold Coast).
My favorite casino to stay at. They have the bestatmosphere. Though it's a bit smaller than other casinos, this place is amazing. Try it out if you want to feel 21 for awhile.
I am a frequent Vegas visitor and have been to this casino/hotel numerous times.  I thought maybe last time that it was an off-day, but tonight makes me think this is more common.  I went to go valet and the guy said he could only valet cars for people staying at the hotel.  He asked for a room key.  I'm thinking maybe it is a full house tonight or something, right?  The entire casino was fairly empty.  There was no concert playing; no special event.  No Vegas hotel has ever turned me away from valet.  I even had the $$ in my hand to tip the gentleman.. . Getting inside to the casino was another story.  There were heavily intoxicated folks blocking the doors and no staff at the hotel were around to take control and let people come in without being hassled.  I know it is Vegas and I get that it is party city, but it is a turn off for me for no hotel staff to even have them move to the side to catch a cab or whatever they were doing.  . . The gambling was just eh this time but the customer service was even worse.  The dealer I had was amazing and she, in not so many words, said that this was an issue there and that a lot of tourists and locals are turned off by the customer service before walking through the door.  I appreciate her honesty and enjoyed my time at the table.. . I don't think I will be spending my hard earned dollars here again.
I stayed here a few months back. The only real downside to this hotel is that it's not really within walking distance to the strip. However, we got a deal online for a discounted room, and the room was SO nice, especially for the low cost we paid. . . We had a mostly pleasant experience with all of their staff except for one bell man. When we pulled up to valet check in, this man was really rude to us and said that we weren't allowed to bring ANY outside food or drink into the hotel, which I found VERY odd. I've been to Vegas many times and I've never had this issue. Regardless, he said we could "sneak" in our alcohol. So we put all our alcohol into our luggage and bags, and had him take in all of our bags. When we were in line to check in, he storms up to us with our cart and starts almost yelling at us, saying that his boss saw him sneaking in alcohol for us and that he could lose his job. He then took all our items off the cart and handed them to us while we were still waiting in line. Super weird and definitely put a damper on our start to the night.. . So other than the issue with the bell man, we really enjoyed our stay here. I think it's worth the $10 cab ride to the strip to stay here and save some money!
I normally never write reviews of establishments. But i'm incredibly baffled at how the Hard Rock Hotel did business. I will DEFINITELY NEVER stay here again! (Read further to avoid being SCAMMED). . After I checked out of my room. I thought everything would be fine. I asked the front desk was there any additional charges added to my room, they informed me that everything was fine. The next day I see a charge on my account for $150 and I found that very weird because when I checked out they said everything was fine.. I called to see what the issue was and they informed me that there was an extensive cleaning fee added to my room. I again found that odd because I pretty much cleaned up the room when I left. My mom taught me better then to leave any where you leave trash.. The Hospitality manager sent me photos of what they claimed was our room. Basically someone dumped out all our trash cans, and sprinkled it all over the room. There was a broken iron board on the floor, and a list of things wrong with the room. I was shocked because that was NOT the condition I left my room in. I wouldn't have even been able to even get out of my room if I had left it in the condition that they claim. Long story short, they refuse to refund me. Even though they agreed with me that the room looked odd and it was most likely not the condition I left my room in because I would not have even been able to get out!  . . lesson learned: always take a picture of the condition you leave your room because apparently hotels like to SCAM you. As if staying there wasn't already expensive enough! Definitely telling all my family and friends to NOT stay at this hotel. I came with a group of 5 and we are all doing the same thing. This is the most ridiculous thing i've ever had to deal with from a hotel by FAR. Unbelievable.
Our stay at the Hard Rock was just ok.  The room was just ok.  Pink Taco was just ok.  Rehab was just ok.  Nothing that would bring me back in the future.  . The rooms are already looking worn & the paradise tower is fairly new.  We did have issues with the TV, and they did come and fix it fairly promptly.   . My previous visit to Rehab I would have given 5 stars. It is now on Saturday & Sunday, so we went on Saturday.  Just not the same fun.  Paid a good chunk for a daybed & the service was really lacking.  I guess I will stick to the smaller day clubs from now on.  The pool on Friday was ok which was probably the best part of our stay.
I stayed at the HR June 15 and 16, 2014 and unfortunately it was a regrettable experience.  The hotel has become a bit shaggy and worn with a commensurate lack of  concern for customer service. . .  i checked-in at 2:00 pm (their regular check-in time begins at 3:00 so granted, i was early) and was told my room wasn't available and in the very same breath the desk clerk asked if i wanted to upgrade to a corner room for another $40 per night extra.  I figured "what the heck" and agreed to the increase/upgrade.  Bad move.  The upgrade was anything but.  I did get a "view"but it was of an empty lot housing a few dozen bedraggled palm trees and and unvisited parking lot reserved for maintenance vehicles/staff.  Next, the room was not fully serviced and there were no cups, amenities, etc.   I had to ask the cleaning staff three times for a cup and three times i received nothing.  I also waited until the next day at 6:30p for the room to be serviced for the first time since I had checked in.. . In any event,  this place is truly between a "rock and a hard spot"(chiasmus intended) and i would advise fellow yelpers to avoid it and opt for the strip hotels for a first rate experience.
Just got back from an awesome three days at the hard rock. Stayed in the paradise tower on the 10th floor and my room overlooked the rehab pool.. Here's the rundown:. Get a cabana worth every dollar.. Do not order smart water mine was 15 dollars a bottle. Total rip off. Get a rehab cup and get that refilled for free. . Go to mr luckys and pink taco both are awesome. . Service was excellent in the whole hotel felt safe everywhere.. Don't worry if your not 25 you'll still like it if you can appreciate rock and roll. I love it and the music playing was a bonus.. Awesome hotel I'll be back.
I arrived late... 7PM last night. Had booked 'best room available' online through bookings.com (Huge mistake) should be called 'bookings.not!' . Asked if upgrade was available when I arrived at the hotel and for an additional 30.00 a night I got my 'upgrade' ... I didn't care about the price.. I wanted the nicest room they could provide me with. The view was beautiful!  I put my things in the room and left for dinner with my sister in the hotel  (150.00 for two at the hotel steakhouse.. No drinks) Came back to my room so tired... I went right to bed. . Woke up this morning and in the morning light realized my room was disgustingly unsanitary and I had just slept in it...It had never been cleaned from the previous 'guest'. There was blood in my bed... I saw this first and thought I was hurt.. Realized it wasn't mine and started looking around  there was dried 'cum' on the ottoman, right next to cocaine on the floor and table(see pictures). The room was disgusting but I had clean towels and soap? I had several managers come to my room and they agreed it was disgusting! Promising to do a 'deep cleaning ' because they were 'sold out' and could not provide anything nicer. I told the manager I would be back late so they had plenty of time to clean it. When I got back my bathtub was still disgusting and at midnight had to have soap scum cleaned out. This happened in the HRH Tower... Nicest area available!!!! I hope I don't get sick :( . Strongly recommend if you are staying here to check your room for unsanitary conditions !!! I took pictures...
The Hard Rock belongs off the strip back where nobody can see it. For a place that has been remodeled it sure has gone down hill fast.. . The service is terrible. The staff is rude, especially the security. The security staff acts like you are bothering them if you ask them a question. The cashiers in the cage  are extremely rude, but not as rude as the valet attendants. The dealers are cool and so were the cocktail servers.. . It does not matter how the rooms are, because the staff and the management is horrible. So, I do not need to review the rooms because I do not recommend that anyone should come here. This place used to be one of the best spots in Vegas to hang out and party. What a shame.
I was in town for the investor relations conference earlier this month and got a great deal on a suite in the all-suite tower here. I really didn't feel like staying at the Bellagio and with the deal I got I knew at the end of each conference day I would have something to look forward to. My only complaint is the smoky casino but that is how all casino floors are. Once you go up the elevator its no problem though. The style of the room is slick modern and moody. Huge flat screen. Really nice bathrooms. Comfy couch. I like how the tv was available to watch in bed or on the other side of the suite in the living area. Lots of cool touches and not super feminine or macho so it works for couples.
I was not super impressed with this hotel. If you are into the partying scene, then this is for you. I came on a business trip and each time we go to Vegas we try to experience a new hotel. When we arrived in our room there were disgusting greasy handprints on the headboard of each of our beds! GROOOOSSS right?????  Overall our room just felt dirty. There was what looked like dried up vomit in the bathroom next to the toilet paper. One word...disgusting. When we called to tell them about or room they just said they would send up housekeeping to assess it. When she got there even she was disgusted and sanitized both headboards completely. The shower constantly flooded so we would have a pool in the bathroom, who need rehab if you have your own personal pool in your room I guess. I would not recommend this to anyone. . The only positive was that our room did have a nice view of the strip and the pools were pretty.
This past weekend, I was in town for a convention that was at the Hard Rock, tho we weren't staying there. . . My fiancee and I went to the Circle Bar and opened a tab while we waiting for the expo to start. Once it was time for us to start heading to the expo we told the bar tender we want to close out our tab. He then comes back and says "we've lost your card"- I'm dead serious. . . He had charged/ given our card to a woman on the other side of the bar. Flag 1, he obviously didn't check the card as it was a mans name on the card. . . He comes to us and says he will call security. So fiancee calls our bank to cancel the card, for all we know she could try and use it. Bartender tells us there's no need to cancel he's going to walk through the casino and try and find her. . . Security comes and tells us they are going to look for her. Meanwhile we are now late for our convention and missing a speaker talk. . . Bartender came back and said he can't find her. Security asked us to write down our information and they will call us. . . About an hour later the bartender comes into the expo and says he has our card. Well that's all fine and dandy- it's already been canceled so the card is useless to us, he then said that he would comp our drinks until 5 at the bar. . . Needless to say that this was a huge headache. I understand accidents happen, but this is pretty bad. Obviously he wasnt paying attention, and when handling peoples credit cards he should have! Never staying here!
I haven't stayed at the Hard Rock for a year but was eager to go back. I've been pleased in the past with their friendliness and great service. Unfortunately, the service has declined dramatically. Our room in the HRH tower was very nice (none of the cleanliness issues mentioned in other posts) but that's my only positive. . . Our check in took 35 minutes and when we reached the window there was no apology or acknowledgement of the long wait. There were, however, lots of reminders that outside food and beverage are not allowed as my water bottle was getting the stink eye. Really? Seems rude and disrespectful. The next morning I went to the coffee shop and paid $7 for 2 coffees. There was no real sugar at the counter. When I asked the "barista" for sugar, he gruffly said they didn't have any. I stood there dumbfounded. I eventually went to the diner and got my own. Later that day, I ordered a margarita with salt at the pool bar. BTW, don't expect a waitress to take your order either by the pool or while in the casino. The waitress told me that she didn't have salt for my $16 margarita. Tamara was very giving with her attitude, however.. . Overall, my stay was disappointing. I felt like a nuisance, not a valued guest. Oh well Hard Rock, it was fun for awhile...
I've had a couple of visits here, and while I'm usually not into big, swanky, franchised properties like this, I gotta give 'em a 5 for the players club alone.  They've always been good about comping 2-3 nights any day of the week with just a little bit of play, and there was one visit where they honored my accumulated comp dollars and points from a previous visit four whopping years beforehand.  I've never seen any casino anywhere honor points for that long of a duration.. . I've stayed in a couple of the standard rooms, and they were nice, but it's always been a situation where I wouldn't ever pay money for them, as they're usually quite expensive if not comped.  I've never really checked out the bars, restaurants, pools and other amenities.. . TIP:  Don't move, consume, eat, drink, or touch anything in the refrigerator, wet bar, or snack tray, because you'll be charged outta the yang.  Usually a good rule to follow at any casino hotel that has these things available.  There was one visit when I wasn't thinking and completely cleared out the refrigerator to make way for my personal beverages, and it took a good hour on the phone with the front desk to get the $275 charge reversed, plus about a good 2-3 weeks for the funds to return to my debit card.
Where to start... This hotel really needs to read up on the basis's of customer service. While thinking about my resent stay at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Casino and Hotel I decided to give you my top eight reasons to not stay at this motel. Here we go.... 1. It would be quicker to take a taxia restaurant and have dinner, good conversation and enjoy a delicious desert then wait for your car at the Valet.. 2. Explain what a "non smoking" room means to Hotel guest registration. 3. Entering your hotel room without any type of drinking/water glasses and then asking house keeping for them and waiting four hours for delivery. 4. Attempting to order room service and then being placed on hold for 20 minutes. 5. Walking downstairs to Mr. Lucky's restaurant and trying to place an order for take out and then being told no. I said what? They said I would have to sit at a table, order food and then have it boxed for take home... Are you kidding me..... 6. Calling house keeping to clean the room and having them never show up.. 7. Having drinks and gambling with trailer trash, drunk morons. 8. Bad service, bad attitudes, bad smelling and a really bad experience . If your looking for a great hotel experience in Las Vegas stay at The Aria just up the road on Harmond.
As far as food goes I give them a thumbs down.. the small cafe they had inside the hotel was busy and didn't have many items that were on the menu. The 24hr cafe was okay, nothing out of the ordinary.  However I did enjoy my stay! The beds were super comfy, showers were good, and the pool was amazing! Definitely one of the better pools I've seen! It had warm water, real sand and wasn't too deep. Plus the bathrooms were located near by, and the bartender brought the drinks to you at the pool.
It's pretty easy to sh*t on the Hard Rock as it's best days seem to be behind it, but it's really not a bad place to stay. You can scoop up an HRH room for around the $100 mark most weeknights and they hold up against any room on the strip. The $22 resort fee (per day for wifi and gym use) is a crock, but it seems unavoidable these days. I mean, $66 for three days of net/gym? Lame. As i mentioned the HRH king suite happens to be a nice room. Decorated well, large bathroom, couch, 2 tv's.... it's a comfortable stay. I found the staff (valet/bell guy/front desk/bartender) to be nothing but professional and helpful. . . If you can stand the occasional youngins running around, the HRH can be a nice staycation spot. You have Mr Lucky's for a quick bite (24/7), drinks at both center bars, Nobu, Pink Taco, 35 Steaks + Martini and you can catch a show at the Joint (or always see the Diceman at Vinyl). Nice room and things to do? HRH, I have no qualms with you.
