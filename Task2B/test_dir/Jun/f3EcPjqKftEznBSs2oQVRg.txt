May/17/2014, we got the roof top patio. It was a great service. As later on the night more & more people there, but we have our own privacy. We had a great time. . We have the right to access most of the dance area in the night club. Cool place, good experience.
I went to try this night club out back in sept '13.  Honestly, the bouncers that night I went, I BARELY got through the entrance because they thought my ID was a fake. They checked my face and my ID like 5 millions times and I told them i have the freaking dimple to prove that it's me and HELLO IT WAS VEGAS!! What am I going to do? Not wear any make up going to the club just to prove to these bouncers that it was MY ID. Oh, and They told me to smile just to see if I had that dimple. I was irritated at this point because they spent so much time checking my face and id and then indirectly accusing me that it was a fake. THEN get this, they didn't let my cousin in because they didn't believe it was her. They made her  do everything from rewriting her signature, where she lived, her birthday, etc. . . THEY STILL DIDNT BELIEVE HER. I told them that she was cousin and how is it not possible that it isn't her. They then got those scanner thingys for the ID to make sure the ID wasn't a fake or a stolen one. Then they have like 3 other bouncers check her and after like 10 minutes of this nonsense, they told her that we can get out of the line or they'll take her ID if we try to fight it. OBVIOUSLY, we got out of line because WHAT WERE WE GONNA DO IN VEGAS, IF MY COUSIN GOT NO ID ON HER. Ugh, i was beyond angry by the time we turn around and started walking away, and they had the nerve to be smirking as we left.  So much for a great first experience at this night club. . . NEVER going to try to go to place again. I'll just stick to XS, which the bouncers there were FAAAR more nicer and better than those at PURE.
I wish we would have gotten in to give a true review but how good can it be when the doormen think they're working the door of Marquee or something.....  Too soon??. . I know the drill- bring more girls than dudes, make sure they're hot, be patient, don't act like a douche.  Check.  Still nothing, they said they were sold out and when we turned around to leave they said, just to the guys "well lets talk about this..", code for give me some money.   I get the whole grease-the-doorguy-or wait-in-line thing but after they turned down $50 for the whole group we left.  Something about some celebrity I've never heard of being in there.  They need to remember that some aspect of their job is hospitality.
This was our last stop on party tours both times that my friends and I did it and this was not a good club. There was hardly anyone dancing and the music wasn't that great. The drinks were way over priced and the club closes pretty early. Unless it's a free event again, I won't go back to this club.
