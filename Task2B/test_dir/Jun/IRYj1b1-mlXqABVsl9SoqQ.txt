Tacos El Gordo. The Lengua(tongue) Fries  1/2 order is the best bang for your buck. 6 bucks! . Tacos are decently size, a little high on the 2 dollar side cause im a cheapskate, however 3 tacos will make you content. . . Most tacos 2.00 a taco, tongue 2.25, line is a huge mess, order first pay later. free guac.. . GUAC IS FREE, ASK FOR THAT $%^. Cow Brain taste exactly like monkey brain, soft and fatty. I love tongue, but the way I cook it it tends to be more chewy like you're eating ligaments. I felt as if they kind of over cooked it but im sure thats just how they prefer tongue. Cow head just taste like any other meat. I should have tried the spicy shoulder pork, oh well next time!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The food is the best classic Mexican food I have ever had. I wish we had more of these in vegas. I tip every time I come cause the food is great, the people there awesome and everything is jist great. . . I always always get the adobada tacos. Usually I get 8 just for myself hahah. Its really good stuff. I love tacos el gordo
Memorial day weekend and this place was awesome!! Best bang for your buck after a hard day & night of partying... We got there about 3:30-4am on a Friday night/Saturday morning and it was SLAMMED with lines out the door!! Be ready to wait cause people are ordering 5-10 items at a time because drunk hunger and affordability. Just be ready to know what to order and "STAND IN THE CORRECT LINE"!! Enjoy....
I think I have just discovered another must stop by place in vegas now after a night of drinking. We got here around 12/1 and the line was out the door so we waited well over 40min for our food but it was well worth it. . . Something new that I haven't seen at other places.. their Adobada is very delicious and flavorful. These are street taco size so I'm sure you will be able to chow down on more than 3 tacos. There are so many of their other stuff that I would like to try next time... like their fries? Yes please! Lengua Fries to be exact!. . Free Refills, ample seating, decently priced delicious mexican food. I don't think theres more that needs to be said.
I ordered one ado ads, two lengua, one casa asada with pina colada drink cost only $10.27. Excellent food and I went at 11:45am, it has no line.
Early in the morning or late at night - it's always a good time for Tacos El Gordo! I eat a lot of tacos, probably too many tacos, and this place is my gold standard for taco measuring. Great authentic tacos, plus they have free guac (take note, Chipotle) and delicious quesadillas. People literally sit outside of this place waiting for it to open in the morning - it's that good. But don't be fooled, they may open the door but you still have to wait another 40 min or so to get that taco goodness in you because they still have to finish cooking it all so all you can really get when they first open the doors is a drink. It's a tease. Plan accordingly.
Been here many many times every body I have ever brought has loved it here and they have came back best tacos and I'm Mexican so I should Lol
While looking up cheap places to eat that were good in the city I found this place.  Thought the reviews were by fanatic fans but nope!  . The ambience isn't the greatest but to see your food prepared right in front of you and see what they do was a highlight for me.
Hm, not sure why this place got such high reviews...maybe because most people were tipsy when coming here?  Well, we came here sober cuz we wanted really good tacos and read all the rave reviews.  I told myself and my bf (who was the one who wanted to come here) that driving in Vegas traffic and waiting in this extremely long line better be worth it.  Well sorry my friends, it was sadly not!  It took us about a half hour in the line outside to get to the line inside, lol.  We ordered the spicy pork tacos and a quesadilla and both were just ok - I've had a lot better elsewhere.  Apparently the spicy pork tacos are supposed to be kickass here but for me, they were only meh.  Have you guys ever had really good tacos??!  My theory is that there's not many good taco places on the strip and that's why all the rave reviews?  Who knows, but I'm definitely not coming back here again...
The best tacos I ever had! The tongue taco was my favorite and costs about $2.50. There are three different lines to stand in to get the food you want; However, the lines move fast.
Delicious tacos! Great prices! FAST service!! This place was packed when we went a d the line ZOOMED! It was awesome food too. Carne asada fries were bomb!
This was my second time at Tacos El Gordo--and it was just as good (although more inebriated) than the first. . . Came after spending the night with Lil'John at Surrender. We got the pork shoulder, carne asada, tripe, and tongue. The pork shoulder was my favorite--some bits crispy and some bits very juicy and flavorful. I think we inhaled those tacos within minute (granted, they're sized to be about two large bites). . . Great way to end a great night out, or in the words of Lil'John, YEEAAAYYYUUHHH.
I would recommend this place to anyone who can speak Spanish ...and anyone who likes Mexican food . place feels authentic enough where I felt out of place but nice enough where I was able to order without being too judged.  FYI me and my gf was the only Asian in fact I think the only non mexicans there.  I couldn't really understand what they were telling me but I just said yes to whatever.  They have 3 stations and you just kind of tell them what you want. Portions are small but cheap so you just orders a bunch. The Mexican version of dim sum I guess. The place is open late but can look pretty intimidating if you during the late hours
I love this place, but they need to expand because sometimes it gets a tad busy. However, in the wee hours of the morning, as you're exiting XS..it is quite a pleasant waltz over to grab some al pastor fries to help you KO for the evening. . . Just..so..noms.
YUMMAYYYYYY.. . SOOO great for drunchies. It's literally across the street from the Wynn/Encore, so super easy to access. The best part is that the food is DELISH and CHEAP!. . There was a short line when we went, on a Thursday night around 1am (I know - I'm old now, can't hang!), but well worth it! Yummmmmmmmsssss.
While in Arizona visiting the Grand Canyon I searched for some places to eat because we were staying in Vegas for the week. So when I saw this place on yelp I immediately yelped out and told my mom we must try this place. I was rushing her to get back to Vegas so I could try it. Good thing they close at 3:00 am because most places closed at 9:00 pm and this was one of the only ones open. When I got here I had to have some carne asada fries and a al pastor taco. So after ordering I sat down with my family to eat. Oh heads up the Jamaica drink mixed with sprite and fresh squeezed lime juice is amazing. So after we ate, we decided to just sit a little while and people watch. Well around 12/1 o'clock the crowd started coming and lines were out the door. After a while we left. But overall the food was good and the prices were reasonable. Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Very good ambience. Loved the place
Ok I gave this place a try again and definitely liked it more the second time around. My friends love this place so I had to go again. I probably had a bad first experience because they didn't have the fries. But this time they did and we got it with adobado (probably spelling it wrong but am too lazy to look it up right now haha) and it was so good! My friend and I killed the fries. We came after ebc so we were hungry and ready to eat! Definitely disappointed that they don't have orange bang anymore and still think the line structure of this place isn't the smartest but I would come back again when I'm in Vegas.
The best tacos I've ever had!!! Almost as close as the tacos from TJ. The best LENGUA tacos!!!!  Recommendation: Lengua tacos with a side of roasted chiles. DAAAAALICIOUS! !! . . NEVER MISS GOING THERE FOR TACOS WHEN IN VEGAS!!!. . Worth $2 a taco! !!
Loved it! Tacos taste like the ones I would normally order in TJ. Lines are crazy, separate lines for different meats but move pretty quickly- know what you want when you get to the front of the line. The tamarindo candy at the register is also very good!
Tacos El Gordo is located near the end (or beginning of the strip, depending on where you enter), right next to Encore, sort of across from Circus Circus, and nearby the Riviera Hotel/Casino. Although it's a pretty unassuming location, rest assured you are in the right place.. . Although we drove here from our hotel, I was able to find parking pretty easy. Your mileage may vary of course (we arrived around 9:00 PM). . For new patrons of Tacos El Gordo, things can be a bit confusing. There are actually three (3) different lines going. Two feeding into the restaurant from the outside and one on the inside which is closer to the restroom.. . The two lines outside serve:. . 1) Carne Asada/Chorizo. 2) Adobada (marinated pork). . The line inside serves:. . 3) Everything else. . One of the staff members does come out from time to time to remind people which line to get in - if you are here for the carne asada, it's the line all the way to the left of the restaurant (typically the longest line). . After waiting about 40 minutes, I ordered 12 Carne Asada Tacos to share with my group which came with onion and cilantro, non-spicy red sauce, and a generous helping of carne asada and guacomole. I only decided on 12 because if they were really that good and I was still hungry, I did NOT want to get back into that crazy line.. . Refills are free with purchase of a soda! A definite plus for me.. . Tacos El Gordo also takes credit cards, another plus!. . The Carne Asada tacos were truly amazing. Featuring flame grilled steak and fresh ingredients, this is the perfect food to have anytime or right after a night of dancing and drinking. I think I ate at least 10 of these tacos.. . Tacos El Gordo is definitely popular for good reason. Whenever you see long lines it's one of two things:. . 1) It's awesome. . or. . 2) It's overrated. . I'm happy to report that Tacos El Gordo is awesome and then some. Cheap and delicious food, free soda refills, and takes credit cards? This place is easily a winner.
The only thing that would make Tacos El Gordo better is if they served beer. Luckily you can grab one across the parking lot. . . We ordered 9 steak tacos & I'm ready to die of happiness. I can't wait to go back & try the adobada tacos & fries.
This place was recommended by a friend when I moved to Las Vegas.  The food is consistent, and everyone I have brought here LOVES it!
The tacos de asada were bomb! The guy preparing them was super fast and funny and got the line moving fast. Would definitely recommend. Love to come back and try the tacos de lengua as well. Great snack on the strip while shopping!
I always come here whenever I visit Vegas. The prices are a little higher than most taco trucks, but I would gladly pay 50 cents extra for some good quality tacos. I've also tried sesos tacos here; never tried brains before but they were actually not that bad.
Can I just say something? THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER TASTED!! My love for this tacos is humongous lol! I'm serious though this place is my first stop when I get to Vegas. . . I think the Adobada(spicy pork) tacos are the best ones! I kid you not I eat like 5 of these ! Haha anyways their fries are really good too! This place is good & it's cheap!! At first if you're unfamiliar with this place everything is going to be confusing! They have 3 separate lines for different kinds of food. Anyways this place is amazing & I recommend it (: !
I got 6 adobada tacos, and let me tell you they were some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I consider myself a taco expert. Fresh corn tortillas, pico, and the meat is cut right in front of you. The only down side is the wait is stupid long, I waited about 40 minutes, it also seemed like one of their kitchens were closed. Other than that these tacos are amazing at $2 a pop!
I went to this place on Wednesday and it was packed I thought the food was gonna be good well... I was soooo wrong I ordered a "quesadilla" with meat it was a soft tortilla (the size of my hand) with cheese and meat and on top of the meat they put a burned tostada I have never seen a quesadilla prepared like that and it didn't even taste good it had no flavor. My cousin ordered some tacos and the tortillas were  stuck to the paper they put them in  Worst place I have ever been to.
Back when I was a ye lad, my family and I used to go to Tijuana, Mexico at least 6 times a year. We would stop at this taco stand named Tacos El Gordo. It was some of the best tacos I have ever had. And my first time having a mula (it's like a small sandwich of tortillas with cheese, guacamole salsa and choice of meat). I always wanted them to be in the states. . . I came to Vegas a few years ago and I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd, I can't believe my eyes! Tacos El Gordo! I immediately stopped and ordered my tacos.  Wow! Tasted the same as the small stand in Mexico! And they hand make their tortillas. . . It's in a small plaza passing the Encore. Parking is sufficient. Outdoor and indoor eating areas. You have to order first and then pay. Your wait is a while, but well worth it! You have to stop here and eat!
Delicious authentic tacos.  It's just anorth of the Encore hotel
Tacos are yummy.  The al pastor tacos are my favorites.  Service is painfully slow.  If you want a taco asada and taco al pastor, you have to stand in 2 lines.  You will easily spend an hour and a half in line.  So for that reason, this place fails.  Probably won't be coming back unless its at an unusual hour to avoid the lines. So the verdict?  Great tacos, but not good enough to spend hours standing in line.
my new favorite drunchies place when I'm in vegas! as a first timer, it can definitely be overwhelming with the large swarms of hungry/drunk people and the confusing line situation (theres different lines for what type of meat or food you want). although the wait was kinda long, it was entertaining to watch the cooks make the tacos. the legit taco chief was seriously throwing guac/sauce in the air and it always landed in the tacos PERFECTLY. i was in awe! the tacos are decently priced and are bursting in flavor. my only regret was not ordering 10 more tacos
Hands Down the Best Tacos in Vegas!. Perhaps even the best tacos in the west. There are other locations, like the one in San Diego, but there is something special about this place. The taste is very authentic, from the hand made tortillas, to the meat, to the fresh salsa and guacamole. If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back. . . Only issue is the line / crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while. But there is a PRO TIP here... offer the guy in the alpastor line a nice 3 dollar tip and ask him to order a few asada tacos for you... works every time ! (Of course this only works in spanish... but it works).. . besides the huge lines, this place is the best... even after waiting 20 minutes... I still give it five stars, cause there is nothing like it... best place to eat in Vegas : )
The absolute best tacos in Las Vegas! Get the pork with some pineapple. Mulas are my favorite. It's an open faced quesadilla piles high with meat and salsa. Go ahead and throw some money in the tip jar and enjoy the VIP treatment. This place does it right on every level!
The line was crazy when we came here on the Thursday night before EDC weekend. You have to order different tacos at different sections of the restaurant. The first line to the left when you enter the doors is for beef tacos, the line on the right next to it we got the spicy abodaba taco, on the corner of that on the right is the lengua taco, and then the carne asada fries on right of that section.  Confusing but you'll probably see it when you enter the restaurant. We ordered half a carne asada fries and it was definitely enough for two people along with 3 lengua, 1 beef, and 1 adobada taco. The tacos ranged from $2-2.50 and the half of carne asada was only $5. We also ordered a horchata which was good too! Seatings are outdoors and we found seats pretty quick but it was so humid sitting outside. Will be back since it wasn't too expensive compared to other restaurants on the strip.
I can see why this place is so popular. The price for the quality of food is unbeatable around the strip. We went here during dinner time and the line was out of the door, but luckily the servers worked REALLY fast. There were different lines for different orders, so I suggest figuring out which line you are standing in before blindly standing behind someone. Overall the food was good, but I wished they had some grilled onions to enrich the flavor.
Great food that was worth waiting for! Long lines but tables continually becoming available so there was somewhere to sit. The chefs are fascinating to watch!. Don't go here for a romantic dinner as seating is mainly outside on the pavement - more of an eat and go place than somewhere to linger. However for great food at a great price this is hard to beat!
There are a lot of taco trucks in LA, but I have to admit, this place is so delicious! Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant.. . I almost always make a trip here when I'm in Vegas. It's super close to the strip, so the drive is not bad (assuming Las Vegas Blvd doesn't have any traffic). However, parking can be hard to find if the plaza is super busy.. . My favorite is the Adobada (spicy pork/pastor) tacos for $2. The Carne Asada fries are also really yummy. They're $10, but HUGE, enough to share for 4-5 people.. . I always want to try other items, but I'm always craving the Adobada that I forget to!. . FYI, the water from the soda fountain tastes weird.
Hands down the best tacos I've eaten, aside from the other Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.  I was so happy to discover that this place was walking distance from where I was staying.  There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it. . . Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.  .      1. Carne Asada and Chorizo .      2. Adobada.      3. All the other stuff. This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!. . I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos. The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.  . . If you want the best cheap eats on the strip, I don't think you have to look much further than Tacos El Gordo.  . . Food: 5, Service: 4, Ambiance: 3, Price: 5
Cheap good tacos is why my husband and I come here.  We splurge on lunch and come here for a quick bite before a show.  I have to say the quality of their meat is pretty darn good it's not all full of fat and gristle.  We tried a variety of tacos and a mula which is a quesadilla with meat. At $2 a pop you can't go wrong. Seating can be a problem sometimes it can get pretty crowded, they also have outdoor seating but with the heat I prefer the ac. It's a noisy hole in the wall but I like those kind of places.  It is clean,tidy and we at least make 2 stops here while in Vegas.
The line was an hour long to get our tacos, probably because of EDC. The tacos were decent, but not great, and certainly not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone an hour! Each kind of taco has its own line, so if you want different meats and are by yourself, you're screwed, or even if you have 1 other person with you and want several different meats, you're still screwed.. . Also, they put guacamole on the tacos, which drowns out the taste of the tacos. I've been to Mexico many times and they don't do that there. California also has a large Mexican population and they don't do that there, either. Some places put chunks of avocados, but not guacamole.. . Maybe these are 4 or 5 star tacos for Nevada, but these are jus average for me. In the SF Bay area tacos are much better.
Best authentic tacos I've ever had. So tasty & really cheap. Anything with their adobada meat is amazing. I recommend adobada tacos with extra creamy green sauce and adobada fries! A half order of their carne asada or adobada fries can feed probably 3 people. They're usually not too busy whenever I stop by, but you never know how busy they'll get since it's right at the end of the strip. Customer service is usually great. The parking lot is kinda shady so lock your car doors. Other than that, I think this place is awesome.
Decent tacos, piss poor restaurant.  . . Lunch line was 45+ minutes.   They have 3 lines which is incredibly confusing.   No help from any employee, which would help the line move faster.    . . Outside, in the 100+ degree weather there are no fans, no misters, no service.. . Tacos were like $1.40-$2.00 each, and not worth the wait.    I'd much rather pay $15 for 3 tacos at CABO WABO that are made with much higher quality ingredients and taste a whole lot better.
For all my Mexican homies, one word: BOMB! Only bad thing, no booze sold here! But, you can bring your own! Lovely thing about Vegas!!!!
Two stars for extreme inconvenience. The food was ehhh. I've had better asada fries at home. The layout for this place is just plain stupid. There's different lines for different meats and if u accidentally get in the wrong line, because it isn't really obvious that u have to stand in a certain line for specific food, you may be turned away and asked to stand in a much longer line. It's ridiculous. We sat inside and every time you need to refill your drink or get napkins, whatever, you have to fight through people waiting in lines. After you order and get your food, it's then you go across the room to pay for it. They're asking for shady people to walk out the door without paying. Whoever designed that place needs to never design another establishment.
This one star is because if how I was treated there. After walking in the heat with a group of friends we stopped in for food. No air conditioning!! Just hot air blowing, and in Vegas this isn't a good thing. . . I started to feel very lightheaded waiting for a log time in the huge crowd to order. There was no drinking fountain in site and I had to ask three people for a cup of water, because I could feel that I was going to pass out. They said they were out and I asked if they had ANYTHING to put water in, a lid, a chip tray, and they said no, and refused me anything even though I told them I was going to pass out and saw a stack of cups behind the counter. . . I found a chip tray and drank from the fountain drinks water tap. By then it was kind of too late. I had to find a seat and try to chill out because I was on the verge ofblacking out, my vision was blurry. So, never going back.
I had to update this down one star because I went the other day around 10-11pm on a Thursday night and wasn't expecting it to be busy, but of course it was. I didn't mind waiting in line at all because the line was just up to the door, but the biggest problem was... the line wasn't moving for at least 15-20 minutes. I was standing in the same spot for the longest time and it didn't look like anyone's order was coming up. Usually, they can get people their food pretty quickly but not this night. Some people were complaining because each line was for different kinds of meat and so groups had to split up into the different lines so they could get carne asada, adobada, etc. and waste time going on every line. There needs to be a better system for that because if someone is by themselves on busy nights and they want different kinds of tacos, are they supposed to wait in every single line and let their food get cold? . .  I still enjoy the food here and will most likely come back but this is what I experienced recently the other night.
Was looking for something quick to eat.. I have a great love for street tacos, so while looking on yelp I came across this place.. Some on the best damn tacos ever.. My Favorites: Adobada (Spicy Pork), and the  Carne Asada tacos.. . Come early to to avoid the long lines and stay away from coming at lunch time, because you will be sorry!!
Tacos were good, the system of getting your food was so unorganized! Not worth the hour wait!
When they offer tripe,  brain or tongue tacos,  you know the place is authentic. But go for the spicy pork  adobada tacos. Came for two,  ate four.  The carne asada with prickly pear (Taco Azteca con nopal asada)  was also very good.
The food here is amazing. Service tho... Really need to be improve. The guy on charge to make the Adobada fries was rude, I had an special request and he called me abnormal WTF?? After all he did not make my special order the way I asked for and told me that I will have to get in line to get another fries. . . Great food. . Horrible service -0
My lengua was not fully cooked and honestly gross. The ordering is very weird and annoying. I'm not one to complain a lot, but the food is not worth the hassle of ordering and paying at a seperate part. Especially cold food.
