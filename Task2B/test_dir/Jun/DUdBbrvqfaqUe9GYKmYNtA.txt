A cut above the sleazy downtown hotels, but they close the pool at 7 pm. Never had that happen at a marriott. Room is mediocre. If the convention was not here I would not stay here and next time I will walk from another hotel.  Inside restaurants are mediocre that we have tried.  Staff generally is foreign and does not speak English that we can determine. . . Find another place to stay. There are many other better options.
I wish you could give half ratings on this website. I'd give this hotel a 3.5. . After visiting vegas a few times, I finally decided to try out The Mirage. For the most part everything was GREAT! Checked-in with a girl behind the desk. Her name was Ashley. SUPER SWEET GIRL!! She took off our resort fee of $56 for choosing to stay at the hotel. I had asked for a room with a view when I booked this hotel and got what I asked for. Room service is great!! (overpriced but you expect that in every hotel). The staff were very prompt and friendly. LOVE the hotel's atmosphere. The pool is a good size and there is a lot of room to spread out with your group. Food and drink service around the pool as well. VERY CLEAN considering all the drunk people everywhere with their beer bottles and whatnot.. .  I only really have two complaints about the hotel.. 1. ROOMS- The rooms aren't as big as the pictures perceived them to be. The air conditioner was also in an awkward spot in the room, which left most of the room very warm. I wasn't expecting anything HUGE in terms of size, but I was expecting a little more space to move around. The bathroom was also a little on the small side. My biggest problem with the room was the door. IT ONLY HAD A DEAD BOLT. Most doors that I'm aware of have both a door lock and dead bolt lock. I think if they took the time to update the rooms, this hotel would be outstanding.. . 2. RUDE GIRL WORKING AT REVOLUTION- I didn't get her name, but she had what most girls would call a "constant bitch face". Didn't spend anytime in revolution but had asked her for directions, I was very unimpressed with her bitchy attitude, I reported her at check-out. SORRY YOU HATE YOUR JOB SO MUCH HONEY. . That being said, if I were to stay here again, id probably go for a bigger room.
We went to the Mirage on our trip to LV, but we didn't stay there.    We had their deli sandwiches and they were wastefully huge, and we didn't order the large sandwich.  The service was wonderful.   . . On another occasion we had lunch at the California Pizza Kitchen, but the service was the worst.  The waitress was not available, didn't care if our drink glasses were full.  It took 25 minutes to get her attention or the bill, but she was on target to pick up the money!  I would never, ever go back there.. . We also went there to see Kathy Griffin, who is hysterical.  She seemed a little scrambled, but the show is one not to miss.  I'm glad we went.. . We also went to the Mirage to see the dolphin and white tigers.  We got our AARP discount and enjoyed it.. . I am happy where we stayed, but the Mirage is a definite place to go.
I agree with Kelly H.  If there were half stars, The Mirage would get 3.5 stars. But, they don't deserve a 3 so I will upgrade them to a 4.. . There is a special place in my heart for The Mirage.  I have stayed here, at least 20 times.... I used to come here with my family at least once a year, sometimes twice.  Even though the place is still as magnificent as it was in the 90's, bigger things have come and taken its mojo.  The hotel itself is deserving of 4 stars, hands down.  They have one of the best pools in Vegas.  It's large, covered in palm trees and it even has a waterfall that takes over one of its pools.  The casino is large and spacious... A great mixture of table games and slots with a decent poker room.  Back in the day, Mirage's poker room was THE room, but now Wynn, Aria andBellagio fight for that title.  The restaurants have all been updated for the most part and seem to be going the Celebrity Chef route (Heritage Steak and Morimoto, opening late 2014).... California Pizza Kitchen is still there though, and it's just as delicious as it was 20 years ago.  Way back when I remember The Mirage buffet being the BEST in town.  I would go with my family and have the best turkey and mashed potatoes, chocolate eclairs while my mom had prime rib and crab legs.  Times have changed and they revamped their buffet into Cravings.  Although not bad, this place isn't what the buffet once was.  The food is very generic and having dined at other buffets within the MGM Mirage resorts, I feel like it's the same food. I would much rather spend the extra $10 and go to Wynn Buffet across the street.  . . OK....Onto the rooms....... . There are two room types, a standard room with either a pool/strip view, volcano/strip view and a view of the west side of town (nothing)..... The standard rooms come with either a kind or two queen beds and a shower/tub combo. Having a shower/tub combo combined with a tiny bathroom makes this room completely outdated, no matter how comfy the bed is (more on the beds later!!) The water takes a long time to drain and the water pressure from the shower is almost non-existent. If you decide to close the door, expect the bathroom to be a steam room basically. Very hard when you're trying to get ready! The other room type is a Tower Deluxe Room on the 25th-30th floors. These rooms come with only a king bed but have a shower and separate bathtub, with a slightly larger bathroom. These rooms are pretty awesome and definitely deserving of 4 stars. What makes the rooms at The Mirage GREAT are the beds. The beds are one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The best beds in town are the ones at Aria & Wynn/Encore.....Bath products are upscale Aqua Lime and rooms come with an iron, safe, blowdryer and a desk with a comfy chair, for you business professionals. Wi-Fi is on the slower side and resort fees are $25 a night plus tax. The gym is large when compared to other hotel gyms, but not as nice as Aria or Wynn/Encore. The overall theme is that The Mirage is not as great as its more modern rivals, but still magnificent after all these years.My advice, stay in a Tower Deluxe Room and ask for a strip view room. If that costs more or around the same price as Aria, Wynn, Encore, Cosmopolitan or Mandalay Bay...Stay at one of those properties instead.
I like this hotel for one thing.  The location is great and the hotel rooms are Hilton-quality.  Its a great launching pad for a night on the town and have enough space to spread out when you crash at an affordable price.  The room quality is consistent and definitely more on the affordable side given the central location on the Strip.  During the downturn, we stayed here for $39 over the weekend one time.  It was amazing!  The prices are nowhere near that now but its still reasonable.  The only affordable place I like here is BLT and the discount for the in-house show "LOVE" is a great deal.  The pool is large and hardly has anyone in it since everyone is too busy sunbathing in the huge rows of chairs.
Loved my anniversary stayed at The Mirage, manager Zachary upraded our room to a strip view suite (25th floor). I would definitely recommend this resort yo my friends and family.  It's just perfectly located,  plenty of activities, the pool is great and the volcano show is a most.
My 3 friends and I stayed at the Mirage for my friend's 30th birthday weekend in Vegas, and all of our were impressed by what a great option the Mirage ended up being! The location was perfect - right on the strip, and about a 15 minute walk to the Bellagio, Cosmo, etc. We had a room with two Queen beds which was roomy and clean, nothing fancy, but perfect for what little time we were in our rooms. I had stayed at The Cosmopolitan Hotel the last time I was in Vegas, which was stunning, but Mirage was a great mid range option.. . I was initially worried it would be more of an older crowd - and while there were definitely a lot of middle-aged people staying there, there were also quite a few younger groups around late 20s early 30s for Bachelor parties, birthday parties, etc. . . The service was great, and the hotel was easy to navigate - it didn't take half an hour to exit the casino or a long time to wait for elevators at all (unlike the Cosmo). . . We got an Air Canada vacation package which included flights and hotel, and this hotel is a perfect option for those who are looking for a centrally located, clean, decent hotel at a reasonable price. . . Definitely recommend this!
Pretty much everything about this place is awful. I stay on the strip a lot and this is my first time here. Let's star with how crappy this place is:. . 1) Cable is constantly pixelated and watching TV isn't possible unless you want to watch a constantly stuttering show.. . 2) The worst internet ever, practically non-existent. The few times I could contact in the room page loads were so slow it took minutes to load a simple web page. I called several times and they couldn't fix, speed test was .08 Mbps. Finally they moved me to a so called "Internet Room" which supposedly had a router in it. It worked in the new room but was still very slow, speed test was about .4 Mbps. Barely passable to do basic web browsing. Apparently they are aware that there internet sucks here and have special rooms set aside for people that complain about it. Cable TV was even more pixelated in this room.. . 3) 5-10 min wait times whenever I call the Front Desk.. . 4) 5 min wait time when I called Room Service. Then they tell me they can't give me what I wanted because there supposed 24 hour kitchen isn't all working. Then they tell me I can't put it on my room because there systems are down. Then they call back 15 min later and say what I ordered also isn't available. I Finally told them to cancel the whole damn order.. . There's probably more bad stuff that I can't recall at the moment.. . What was good about it:. . 1) Checking out and getting the hell out of there and never coming back.
We stayed at the Mirage 6/4-6/9 recently for our wedding we didn't get married in property but the service was amazing and everyone was extremely helpful and friendly . Will definitely be staying there again! Great food options in the casino and the Paradise cafe out by the pool is great as well
I stayed at the Mirage last week for my first trip to Vegas. It's a beautiful hotel and it's in the PERFECT spot. I love the part of the strip where this hotel is located. You're right in the middle of everything. They have a great pool, the "Secret Garden" is a cute little activity (not worth $15.00 but it'scute). They have great service, everyone is super friendly and helpful. They have lots of food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their club 1 Oak is SO MUCH FUN, especially on a Saturday night!!! Wow, it's what partying in Vegas looks like in movies, it's amazing! I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage and would definitely stay there again!. . Can't forgot my FIRST impression of the Mirage, when you walk in, you get hit with this amazing smell, I don't know what type of air freshener or whatever it is that they spray or have circulating in there but it smells SO good, it's like stepping in to heaven. Loved that.
Love the Mirage! Always clean and the pool is beautiful.  Highly recommend it's in the center of the strip and has a free monorail over to TI. Some have complained that the pool is not deep but I enjoy it anyway.  Has a relaxing bar, coffee shop, sandwiches,  pizza and burgers something for everyone.  It isn't the flashiest Hotel but is beautiful and relaxing. Try It You Will Be Hooked!
SO disappointed in my recent stay at the Mirage.. . I had stayed at the Mirage in April with my mom and had a great experience-- no issues, quiet and clean room-- no problems.. . I stayed at the Mirage with my boyfriend on June 4th and June 5th. We redeemed free rooms from our MyVegas account, and the night under my account was the 4th and his was the 5th. They charged us separate security deposits for each night. My boyfriend was refunded his immediately; I am still trying to get my $100, 10 days later. . . I have called the Mirage on the 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, trying to get my deposit back. I was given the run-around by different people each time I spoke to someone. First I was told that it takes a week to get my money back. When over a week had passed, I called again and was told that the reason I didn't get my money back yet and my boyfriend had was because different banks take different amounts of time to refund money. We have the SAME back and the SAME type of account so I knew this was not the case. When I explained this to them, they said well just wait and you should get it back. I called back the next day and was told to call back tomorrow to speak to the head cashier, who had already gone home for the day. I called back this morning and FINALLY got ahold of the head cashier who said "We already released the money back to you. Your bank won't give it to you for some reason." I was like, "That doesn't make any sense. I was told to talk to you because you are the person who authorizes charges to banks." She said, "Well I do, but I'm not doing that for you. You need to call the bank yourself." Thanks a lot bitch! . . Anyway, I called my bank and was told that the Mirage NEVER issued me my $100 back, so the bitch I spoke to today was clearly lying to me. I had to open a dispute with my bank for a $100 that the Mirage is apparently refusing to give back to me.. . The stay itself was disappointing as well. EVERY DAY we were woken up by screaming neighbors and the maids yelling in Spanish at each other down the halls. When you are out until 3am, do you really wanna hear people yelling in the hallways at 8am-- ESPECIALLY the people who work there?! What a joke! . . I would seriously caution against staying here. There are so many great places to stay on the strip that there's no reason to waste your trip here. It wasn't even worth it for the free room for all the headaches these idiots have given me. You would think that a hotel that has been around forever would understand how to refund an incorrect charge but apparently not! Stay at the Aria. Everyone was so nice and courteous and we got our security deposit back the next day. I will definitely not be returning to the Mirage ever.. . UPDATE: After being on the phone for nearly two hours, we cleared this up. They somehow gave my boyfriend an extra $100 instead of giving me my $100 back. if anyone else has an issue like this, speak to William, a manager at the front desk. He is very helpful and warm individual!! Thanks William!!
This casino is kind of jungle themed ... with all the plants and fish every where. Loved the Beetles show here and the volcano show! I really want to see the tigers next time!
Was having a great time until I realized they house six captive dolphins. Was shocked...they are literally in a swimming pool. Really sad. No thanks i'll stay elsewhere next time.
My boyfriend and I chose this hotel because we loved the lobby, but our stay and the rooms were beyond disappointing.  After staying 4 nights and 5 days we will definitely not be staying there ever again.  Long story short, the rooms were disgusting and our 4 nights there we were given 3 different rooms and NOT comped for how inconvenient our experience was.  Also, we were not able to talk to the manager at all about the problems we were having either.. . Issue #1: check in was ok. We were given a room that didn't look over the strip, just the freeways.  We asked for a strip view so we could see the volcano show and what not, but it wasn't a big deal.  On the surface the room seemed fine until the next morning at about 6am we were woken up by a waterfall coming out of the bathroom light fixture. Not just a little water but a full on waterfall that was loud enough for two very hungover and tired people to be woken up by.  We had to call the front desk twice (in about an hour period) and then actually go downstairs to have a maintenance person come up and check out the issue.  After waiting about 2 hrs for it to be "ok'ed" by someone we were told that it was also completely safe to take a shower and use the lights in our bathroom. We were told it was probably a broken pipe from the room above us and that as long as they didn't take a shower that we wouldn't have an issue? cheap, but we were both on vacation and I didn't want to ruin it.  After we showered and started getting ready all of our lights short circuited (probably because water and electricity don't mix), even thought according to the Mirage everything was "ok".  this is when we requested our first room change. NO way did we want to wake up again at 6am or have electrical problems in a resort room.  Sorry Mirage, but if i wanted waterfalls and no electricity I wouldn't have spent my vacation in Las Vegas... BEWARE, don't let them book you in room 5066. . Issue #2:  later that afternoon when we returned back to our room we had a voice mail from the front desk letting us know that we needed to change  rooms to another on the 4th floor right below us (forgot the room number). we had no help with our luggage but I was just happy that they listened to our complaints about the leak issue and relocated us. BUT the room we were relocated to had BLACK MOLD EVERYWHERE in the bathroom.  Immediately after walking into the room we noticed the very dank/musky smell the room had... at first we thought nothing of it, maybe it just needed to be aired out... It wasn't until my boyfriend and I started having headaches and becoming nauseated that we discovered the black mold issue. Not only is that beyond disgusting, it's also dangerous! We didn't get another room until 1pm the next day.  . . Our final room was 23033 and it was pretty good. the plumbing worked, and there was no black mold .  The room itself looked like it needed to be vacuumed and there was hair everywhere in the bathroom,  BUT those were doable for us.. . . FINAL ISSUE! Mirage never comped us for the 2 failed rooms that we had... they waived our "convenience fee" ($28ish i think).  Other than that we had to pay IN FULL for the waterfall room and the black mold. The front desk never let us talk to the manager directly, just worked as the middle man, so we never got to express our concerns.  DEAR MIRAGE, you lost a customer!  We would of responded differently if we were not ill treated and actually refunded for YOUR disgusting rooms.. . But FYI, the employee Juan Martinez was very polite and professional. . . our stay from from June 12th-16th
This was our first time to stay at the Mirage. We were very happy. During check-in, Margo, was training a new guy. Do to the training it may have taken 3 minutes longer to check-in. However, Margo made it worth wild. She has a great personality, was teaching the new guy how important it is to take care of the customer. I'm sure Margo could write the book on customer service!! All of the Mirage employees were very helpful and friendly. The pool was awesome. Free parking was a big plus!! There is a Starbucks inside!!!! The hotel needs to add a coffee pot to the rooms. I love Starbucks, but can't go there in my underwear. We will return.
It's getting old. The room smelled oldy. The Parking structure is dirty. The buffet is great.. The Mresort is the best!
DO NOT STAY HERE DURING EDC. First off, the pool is nice but super boring, no music at all. Had a horrible experience with the bell desk, who treated me like annoyance and not a paying customer after I lost my credit card and tried to receive it
This years trip was just OK. Seams this hotel is hit or miss, but not consistent with atmosphere, friendliness of staff and room selection. CPK is always good, the buffet is getting real good again, pool is still great and the secondary smaller valet staff is excellent. Other than that, it was just OK.
This is our 4th year in a row coming to Vegas for EDC week in June. I've stayed at a few different hotels ranging from a suite at the formerly known PH Towers, South Point Hotel, Suite at Treasure Island, Stratosphere and now Mirage. I'd have to say that without a doubt the best overall experience I've had was at the Mirage. I do think their rooms are a tiny bit over priced for the week we were there however. The hotel itself has nice amenities and we loved the pool (The do need more servers at the pools however). We tried most of the restaurants inside and the only one we did not like was the Carnegie Deli. The Carnegie Deli is a huge blemish on this hotel. They are very disorganized, slow and the foot options just don't all really make a lot of sense. We tried it last year and gave it another go this year and had almost identical bad experiences. As for the rest of the hotel the rest of the staff was always friendly and we had no problems. . . The beds in this hotel are down right amazing! I think we are going to order one of their pillow and comforter sets they sell in the hotel shop. . . Our biggest complaint would be the night club. Each night we returned to our hotel there were always some very unsavory individuals lurking about that had just left the club. One night a man was making very inappropriate gestures at my girlfriend making her very uncomfortable. Other nights there were just people being really loud and obnoxious coming from there, making her and I both a bit uneasy. We would love to see a dance music based night club in there. . . Great job Mirage, I think we will be back!
I was very fortunate to get an incredible deal on my room, so was able to enjoy it for a few more days. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the bed, the room itself, the bathroom, and the amenities. If this is the "regular folks" room, I can only imagine the others.  . I must say was very disappointed to find the snacks etc which are placed in the room, are not free.  Six dollars for a bottle of water..... yep..... wonder if that is how they make up the difference in the price for the room. Why bother putting them in there- I buy my own and for much less expense. Note, if you lift an item, it automatically gets placed on your bill. SO watch those kiddos, and if they pick something up- call the desk immediately so they can verify. Do the same if there are any items missing from the selection. . Nightclub is a problem. The crowd extends well into the lobby path making it difficult to maneuver through. Also some pretty freaky looking folks hanging out there. I was traveling alone, so waited for crowd to get to elevator before getting on. It's Vegas- I trust no one...LOL.... . I received one free meal with my stay. Big disappointment. The salad chef messed my salad up and insisted I take the one he made- he made it with blue cheese and I cant stand that stuff- and I was clear about that from the start, another chef stepped in and corrected my order. I also  ordered the prime rib, it was cold enough for grease to set in on the bottom of it, and little lumps of fat in the broth. What the heck happened here? Anyway, free or not, I will be off the strip at some nice steak house next visit.  Their buffet is right expensive, definitely not a good bang for the buck.
Throughout my 5 day stay here, I was locked out TWICE because THEIR lock was broken. I called the front desk using my phone to tell them that my card key was not working and that I was locked outside my room. They had told me that they would send someone up to my room and that it would take about 10 minutes or so for them to come up. 10 minutes passed, and then 15, and another 20.  I was sitting outside my room for a whole hour frustrated out of my mind because I was on a time constraint. In the end, the person they supposedly sent never came, but luckily for me, I had a friend staying at a suite on the 19th floor. When I came back a couple hours later, we went straight to the guest services to tell them again what happened and they moved us to a different room while they jumped the lock and got our things for us.. . Two day after the incident,  I requested room cleaning three times within the same day, and every time we got back to our room (after two or three hours) it was not clean. Called them up another time to express my frustration with their services and they apologized and they finally sent someone up to clean our room. . . After my experience here, my advice to you is to stay at another hotel/casino. The service here is terrible.
My boyfriend and i stayed at the mirage for two nights and absolutely loved it! The staff was super friendly, quick check in, crystal clean room, valet parking was easy as can be. the view was upgraded upon arrival so we had strip view and could watch dolphins swimming in the morning. the casino had a lot of classy people no bums. security was awesome and i felt really safe. cant wait until i stay there again!
Very nice Las Vegas hotel. The hotel is enormous, with about 3,000 something rooms. I know that doesn't even compare with some of the other ones, like Caesars or the Venetian. Check-in was extremely fast. It's sort of a long walk through the casino to get to the guest elevators, though. Hotel has a great selection of restaurants. A great location, right next to Caesars palace and across the street from the Venetian and palazzo. The pool is great and huge, but gets crowded and also there are usually many people having drinks on the edge. The volcano show is really something else! Definitely try to see that. Great stay, and would recommend to anyone. Great job, Mirage!
