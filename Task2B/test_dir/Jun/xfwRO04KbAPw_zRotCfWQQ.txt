Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict? Mouthgasm. No need to explain. I live in So Cal... Take me back please :(
I have been to hash house many years ago. I was pleased to see they are growing but not always a good thing. I recently paid them a visit on June 1 at the location on Sahara Las Vegas.I was seated outside with my wife , as it was very busy and we took first available seat. Wait staff outside was a little overworked. My wife ordered an omelet and it came ten minutes before my food. No butter or anything for biscuit and by the time my food came hers was cold. My main huge complaint is I ordered the chicken and waffles beautiful presentation nothing more cold everything chicken cold waffle soggy just bad in every way did look awesome but horrible to eat! Very disappointed as we drove from the Red Rock Resort and could have picked anyplace.
Had breakfast.  If you are looking for huge plates of food with an enormous amount of calories, then you will love it.  Unfortunately I'm just not into it.  The food is kinda just slopped onto the plate with long spears.  And I get it, it's the quintessential Las Vegas thingy these days, moreis better, and if that's your thing, then you will love it.
I used to go to the one at the M resort and really enjoyed everything about it...the food, the view at sunset, the portions!! I will miss it being so convenient but its worth the trip to go to the other one.
Looked extensively for a local breakfast place and decided on Hash House A Go Go based on the fact that they had biscuits and gravy. Of course had to order it - very tasty!Nice peppery gravy atop a split biscuit that was decent atop grilled mashed potatoes which I didn't even try because there was way too much food. Could barely make a dent - I would suggest you go in groups of twos and split one dish!. . My friend had the bacon waffles which she said were okay. Not enough bacon - just two slices over four waffles - she said she had better elsewhere. I didn't even try them. I was too busy digging out the few pieces of sausage in the gravy! I don't even think I got through a third of it.. . Why so many stars? Because of how nice our waitress was - everyone working had really good senses of humour - and the sheer fun of watching the huge portions that went by!
I honestly think this place is truly overrated. I've eaten her a few times and it's always packed.you have to wait and I just think they don't put love in the food anymore. One thing I hate about these types of restaurants is that they get so much hype and once it goes big they forget about what kept bringing you back in.they start slacking on the quality and just becomes mediocre. Maybe I'll come in when it's not busy hoping for better food
The food is delicious and the portions are extremely large. I ordered the grill cheese sandwich, my friend ordered the meat loaf, and other friend ordered the sage fried chicken which was on man verses food. They barely made a dent in their plates. This place is good. I recommend sharing plates or you can use leftovers for lunch or dinner.
I'm not a fan of giant portions and I generally try to stay healthy. That being said, I'm addicted to Yelp and try places against those ideals when I feel it's worth it. Visiting here wasn't my pick. But it wasn't nearly as bad as reviews here led me to expect.. . 20 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday around 11AM, pretty standard.. We were seated at a cocktail table in the bar area and I really liked our server- Kelli?, lady with spiky hair and friendly, casual demeanor like a female Guy Fieri.. . BF ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, and highly suggested that I order the Kokomo meatloaf sandwich- so I did, with the house salad for the side instead of fries.  Portions for both are enormous and we could have easily shared just one dish, but wanted to try more than one dish. And now my guy has dinner to take with him to work tonight, so it all works out. $30 and change before tip.. . Fried chicken and waffles- chicken is actually pretty moist and flavorful, waffles weren't bad but also weren't my thing. Accents of fried leeks and some roasted peppers made this better than I expected. Didn't go overboard with the maple syrup.. Meatloaf sandwich is hefty- ate about a third of it and had my fill of the flavors. Liked the tomato sauce, felt the mozzarella taste was masked by stronger flavors but the texture broke up the meat and bread a bit. Heavy and rich, even if you're hungry, split it.. . Ultimately, my careful picking at each dish and my hungry guy eating what he wanted (damn his metabolism!) only made half of each meal disappear. While many reviews here indicate that the kitchen is more focused on quantity than quality, the flavors weren't bad but given the gigantic portions, easily get redundant. . Best to come with a group and share a few dishes.
I've eaten here several times and the food is fine. But the last time we went to the one on the strip the waitress copied my credit card and sold the number to someone on the internet. Needless to say we won't be going back.
Definitely an experience coming to hash hash a go go for the first time !! Our server Stephanie was very nice and attentive... The honey butter biscuits are off the chain !! I ordered the chicken and waffles and they were on point. !! So crisp and as you probably already know there was half a chicken on the plate pretty much !! I'm a Vegas local now so I'll definitely be back to try something new !
Pace yourself. All portions are enormous! So delicious and fresh you really feel bad leaving anything on the plate...but, it sooooo much food. You can seriously order one and share with friends.
Food here is just a novelty. It has no taste. I had the sage chicken, eeehhh, not much flavor. Uncle had chicken pot pie, no flavor either, plus the crust looked like a flying saucer on the side of the plate. If your going to get anything order breakfast. They can't ruin that right?
Excellent......Too much food for the average man...!
Huge portions and great food, but the only downside is they charge a fee to share.  Or at least last time I went they did.  Kind of a bummer.  How can you put 4000 calories on a plate and expect people not to share?
My family and I ate dinner here for the 1st time today after our daughter's high school graduation and it was awesome.  We arrived there close to 5pm and the place was not crowded at all.  No waiting, we were seated immediately and the wait for the food wasnt bad at all.  Our server was Kara and she was awesome.  We told her this was our 1st time there and she told us about the menu ans details about the sides and also gave us suggestions on what we should try and she was very attentive..we didn't have to ask for anything.  To begin, we ordered an appetizer...the fried green tomatoes and OMG...they were so delicious.  We also got a bowl of the biscuits and they are to die for...YUM.  My husband had the chicken & waffles, my daughter and I had the chicken pot pie, my son had the 1lb burger with bacon and my youngest daughter had the portabello mushroom burger. Everyone said their meal was delicious.   Be prepared for HUGE portions.  The 5 of us each had a leftover box to bring home...we will eat that tomorrow...lol.  We really liked this place and we will definitely go back.   Especially for those fried green tomatoes.
I've eaten at this location and a couple of others around Vegas.  . Last week stopped by for breakfast, had the Chorizo hash, was a little surprised that the food came out before the drinks, and I had to ask for some butter for the biscuit that came with the meal, but the food was very good, hot, and very good flavor. . In general, good food, and good service, I'ld say it has been 2 out of 10 times a fault in the service - worst case they forgot to have a runner bring out the food, it sat and was cold when it came out (they cooked new food, had it out quick and took some of the items off the bill). . For the food side, one friend who got the burger with bacon and mashed potatoes on the burger was a very strange combo.  I had a Thanksgiving turkey meatloaf that missed the mark for me (way too sweet).  . . Over all, it has been a good experience, and it's a place that I try to get to when I get to Vegas.  Just be careful on the weekends, it can get rather busy
Alright, let me be honest about Hash House A Go Go... its pretty meh.  The food was fairly bland with the exception of the blueberry jam (which was perfect), the biscuit was too dense, the eggs were scrambled up with both bacon and cheese and still managed to lack flavor, they used avocados that were very far off from ripe....  The seasoned potatoes were fine I guess, but nothing special.  . . The portions, yes, they were ridiculous.  So huge I'm fairly certain three people would have been full from a single meal...  Some find this a good thing.  I could care less and would have been MUCH happier with a much smaller portion that used better ingredients to make tastier food.. . Also, our server could best be described as terse.  I'm sorry that 45 seconds after sitting down I am still reading the menu, but when I order water (instead of the $14 "BLT Bloody Mary") you do not get to roll your eyes at me.  I probably would have ordered the $12 bacon-free bloody mary a few minutes later if you'd managed to not look annoyed the first go-around.  . . Overall, Hash House A Go Go is not my kind of place, and failed me impress me in the slightest.
I voted 4 stars because i came in just for a latte. If i was voting for food, 5 stars. If i was voting for service i vote 5 stars for the manager chris, but 3 1/2 stars for the bartender who made the lattes.  We ordered carmel lattes, being that we are spoiled san francisco latte drinkers we are desperately looking some place who makes good lattes. (Las vegas is over satuated with starbucks and once you have REAL coffee SB doesnt cut it any more...dont get me wrong SB has its place aka fraps). Well the lattes here to be warn makes you feel that you didnt get your cups worth. Its $7.50 for a carmel latte, and trust me if it was awesome I would gladly pay AND come back often, but the espresso beans here is not yummy.  The cup is filled to about a bit less than 3/4 which instantly makes you feel cheated. Not sure if its their practice, but just a warning of feelings.  And the Plus the amount of carmel and milk this bartender combined did not make it a creamy just well not sure how to describe.  However after mentioning this to the manager chris, we were immeadiately taken care of. We were not made to feel guilty one bit . In fact his customer service was perfect  ! He's a real asset to the company! Now I havent tried the bartenders alcohol drinks, but shes definately not a latte maker. Her personality made you feel if you questioned her about her drink making skills she would instantly tell you to f$@& off hahaha! So overall come for the food, skip the lattes.
This place is delicious and you definitely get an abundance of food. I recommend sharing or being prepared to take food home because they literally bring out plates that are towering with food. It gets really busy on the weekend so be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait.
It's not often i award five yelp stars to anything; however, this restaurant is a rare find by any standards.  The owner/designer/chef were geniuses at creating an experience for the senses.  There is a Mid-West/Italian fusion thing going on in the menu which works on different levels. A rosemary springs impales a stack of potatoes andegg gallettes, chicken in olive oil is incorporated into a hash...well you get the idea.  . . Another interesting element is that each dish is conceived architecturally, a feature that would normally be reserved for  a top Michelin-rated Parisian restaurant.  Food items such as toasted raw pasta straws, herbs in their natural states, etc., give delight to the eye, if not to the palate.  . . Form then moves on to function as the familiar flavors are juxtaposed in unusual combinations which subvert our expectations in a way that would make Andrew Zimmer wax all the more eloquently about the dish being"over the top"!  Lest you think you will push yourself from the table still unsatisfied, let me assure you that each dish would easily feed two or three light eaters. The wait staff were equally well trained and friendly (a Midwest trait to be sure!) which only added to this delightful experience.
Expect a long wait during breakfast/brunch hours with poor service. The food was fantastic, but we waited 30 minutes to be seated and then another 20 to get our food after it was ordered. They brought out of meals for the three of us piece by piece, where more than one our plates were cold. Even still, the food was good.
This food is so good.  Huge portions. We go here with a large group of friends at least once a year.. The  chicken and waffles are so good!   The chicken is cooked with sage.. I just found out I am allergic to sage, but i will risk it for one bite of this yummyness.!. . Go here if you like to eat large portions.  If you want to split a meal, go for it. If youjust wanna be amazed at how much one person can eat, GO HERE!
Wow!! First off I have read great things about this place and bad so was a little worried but.....it was absolutely awesome. First of all the combination of flavors put into the dish is crazy, different, and scary at the same time but definitely good!! I had the champagne super nova which is an alcoholic beverage and you could keep the glass it came in for 12.95. It was so good! I ordered the kids bacon waffle for only 5.95 and I the portion fed 2 kids. I had the chicken fried Benedict... Huge portion so filling, different,and amazing. They call it twisted farm food which fits perfectly! Service was great and prices I thought were crazy good for the amount of food! . . Went back for a second time ordered the chicken and waffles and that was awesome too. I think they also have one of the best and strongest mimosas ever!!
Mediocre quality of food in huge All-American portions. Kind of disgusting. Lots of people love it though... This place is always packed with dudes chowin down on breakfast food.  God bless the USA!
We ate here passing through Vegas because we have family who live there and can't stop talking about this place. We ended up going back when we came back through town! We did this because Hash House A Go Go is wow. Yes the portions are enormous but the food is also really good. I think it does what it is trying to do extremely well. Next time we are in Vegas we will go back. The atmosphere is fun and they have a great kids menu. We love this place!
Customer Service=Awesome. Ambiance=Relaxing . Food=Good. . Food=Big portions which i love cause Im  a big girl... Only could finish half.  Tried the Man vs. Food fav. Chicken Sage benedict.  Cisual appealing with a lot of things going on in the plate.  Tasted better than average but wasn't all that if you know what I mean.  Loved the earthy taste with sage and all this other things that I don't usually eat haha. . . Customer Service=ACA-Awesome! That's why i pushed the stars to 4... When we first stepped in, they were so friendly and not giving us attitude cause we came in 30 min before closing. Weu weren't rushed or anything like that.  I love the customer service!. . Ambiance is spacious and relaxing.  Upscale farm scenery.  Was a little dark so couldn't really see the decor.  . . Will come back for more!
It's ok.  I think they survive more on presentation, big portions, and name recognition than actual taste of food.  There are a bunch of better breakfast/brunch options in Vegas in my experience.
Good food and good service.
(Breakfast) No turkey products :( Not everyone eats pork.
Good food and huge portions I would give 5 stars if they didn't put bacon in everything (goy vay!) I always get the apple pancakes and they are so good!
Man....I love this place! Large portions and the prices are cheap! I got thr chicken and waffles! Biggest chicken n waffles ever! It was awesome! I tried finishing it, I was close though haha. The fried leaks were awesome and the bacon infused waffles....what the Fuuuuuuuuu no way I died....lol it was bomb
UNBELIEVABLE PORTIONS!  If you want more bang for your buck, this is the place to go.  The quality and freshness of the food is second to none.  And normally I can get two or three, sometimes four meals from one entree there.  If you are hungry, this is the place to go!  The Service is good too.  However, be prepared to wait, especially at peak eating times.  They have other locations in town that aren't as busy, but this one definitely has the best food and service.
I have a love hate relationship with this place. While I generally love their food, this is the second time I've gotten sick from it. My second to last day in Vegas I ended up laying in bed all day with a stomachache that resulted in vomiting and a lost day of vacation. I I think next year we might just have to skip this place.. . . The food always tastes great, but someone in our group has gotten sick every year from eating here. The wait times are horrible, and our waiter was kind of meh. After we placed our order it took about 30+ min to get the food. The food doesn't taste good enough to justify the risk of food poisoning and the long waits. . . We will more than likely not be coming back, which makes me sad because there is so much potential.
A plate for one looks like it's actually made for two. If you like to bring home leftovers it's definitely possible to do so here. I tried the chorizo hash with the grapefruit mimosa. My mom tried the steak,egg, and potato that they had as a special on Valentine's Day. She tried the tangerine mimosa. Both mimosa's seemed to be lacking something. It was almost as if they were watered down or weakened in some fashion (in the flavor department). . . The food, on the other hand, was fantastic. Chorizo can be really oily and rich, but the chorizo hash was well balanced in flavor and not greasy at all. My mom's steak was tender and the eggs were fluffy and cooked just right.. . Parking downtown has never really been a breeze, but if you use the valet parking on the side of the Plaza building, you should be fine.
I was insanely drunk at 9am when I came here. My group was loud and obnoxious, but the staff remained professional and kind.
I tend to go to Hash House as my go-to "Oh god we're starving we just off the plane ehhh I don't know what I want, what do you want, I don't know, what do you want" Frustration Ender when I've got Friends and Family visiting, and at that it excels.. . They have beer if it's ridiculous family, and coffee if the hours are atrocious, and the menu's huge enough to please any crowd I've thrown at it. I've been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the Plaza. . . Pros:. - You will never leave hungry. The portions are gargantuan. My father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak and potatoes measured in pounds, please. He's the only person I've ever seen casually finish a meal at HH. Just back from a early morning hike at Red Rocks and ready to eat a bear? Eat here.. - The food's delicious. I've had the Chicken and Waffles a few times, the Chicken Pot Pie, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. The Chicken and Waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. Yum.. - Mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. You feel welcomed. I reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. . - Great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. . - Price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. A bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at Egg Works; which means I'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. That Chicken and Waffles is usually Lunch, Dinner, and lunch the next day for me. As long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, Hash House is a great deal. . . Cons:. - You will never leave hungry. Holy balls there's a lot of food. If your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from Europe and have never heard of the Doggy Bag this place will give you pangs. . - You can definitely eat yourself sick. Be aware of your tummyfeelings.. - Both locations are Popular, and they can get busy. And I mean really busy. Saturday morning around brunch time? Call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. This is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. Settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. If you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.. - I can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups. Anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and I feel like you'd be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but I've honestly never tried it.
I'm a bit of a foodie but I have to say that this place is pretty whack. Way too much hype, way to pricey, and portions way to much. I couldn't even tone down the portions. Food looks good coming out, but there's no flavor. I love eggs Benedict & I thought this twist wouldwould be cool but biscuits and mashpotatoes? I couldn't get a poached egg upon request. No flavor from the entire meal. This is not my first time going there. I've tried @least4 times. Customer service is horrible. Don't waste your time and money
Big portions.  Big portions.  Big portions.  . . They wait time for the lunch hour was about 30 minutes.  We had a group of 8.  The waiter was good and attentive.  Gave us refills when we needed without asking.  Came by and checked on us multiple times.  The food does take longer to cook but the waiter let us know before hand that it would take longer and kept coming by to check on us before we got our food.  The service was 4 stars.. . The food was 3 stars.  Our group order multiple items on the menu from the meatloaf, scramble, to the sage chicken.  I had the scramble and it was good but just above average scramble.  Nothing to rave about.  But my brother had the sage chicken and he could not finish the plate.  He said it was only ok.  My brother-in-law had the meatloaf and complain it was too dry.  So maybe avoid the meatloaf dishes.
