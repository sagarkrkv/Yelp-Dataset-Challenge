Summary: Food is crazy good! Service is fast! Environment isn't too bad either.. . Food:  Are you kidding me? Literally everything that comes out of this kitchen is great! Great attention to detail. . . Service: Pretty good service. Nothing extremely unusual about the service, except that it is fast!. . Environment: Environment is alright. It hasn't been consistent the two times that I've been so I can't comment too much. . . This place is getting a 5 star because the food is unreal!
Awe man, I used to eat here consistently for a solid 3 years. The health code fiasco wasn't something they ever recovered from. Plus they messed it up twice now. Great job guys! Not my go to anymore, sadly enough. They opened up a Taco joint where they used to be. Not bad! Worth checking out.
