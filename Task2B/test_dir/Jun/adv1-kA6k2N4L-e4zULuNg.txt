Great laid-back, casual place to be where you don't have to worry about the headaches of the strip. Best of all, everything is reasonably priced...
Here is the "old Vegas" experience .Dirty, smokey, and the smut of the earth (not in a good way). My friend insisted that Fremont Street was so much better than The Strip. I dunno. Neither places are exactly where I would want to take my kids for a stroll, but there was something particularly carnival-like and scary about Fremont Street. . . Sometimes there are free concerts there. That's cool. I might go back for that. The giant canopy / overhead screen is pretty dang awesome and is something to behold. Other than that, I am not craving another visit. . . I think that everyone should give it a visit. Quite a few people like it. I didn't.
Fremont Street Experience is what Sin City is all about! It's loud, bright, and sinful! This place comes alive at night. The Viva Vision is an arch ceiling that shows music videos. What makes it special? It's operated by 12.5 million lights and 550,00 watts. Every hour, it shows music video. The crowd tend to gaze up and dance to the loud music.  Fremont Street Experience covers only two blocks, but it has a lot of attractions. There are a lot of street performers. From Michael Jackson to a light strip tease, this place is hot! It's just impossible to leave this place without awe!
Freemont street experience is awesome, I totally liked it. This is where it all started before all the hype they have in Vegas. Downtown Vegas was the beginning of the craziness and it's still a nice place to visit, drink, and gamble! A little bit more old school with some stuff and the crowd is a bit more of old people as well. A lot of locals come to this area. Downtown Vegas also reminds me of Hollywood, you got people in the middle putting on side shows, people dressed up as celebrities for pictures and street kids putting on a dance show. What I like best was the zip lining! It's a must if your visit this area!
Been coming for years and the changes in the recent 3 years have brought on really nice changes.  It's in a the midst of a face lift. Excited to see what this place will be like 5 years from now.  It's cleaned up. They've brought the green friendly element into the area.  Installed more things for tourists to enjoy like the Zipline over the Freemont Experience walkway. Some of the hotels have updated and remodeled. They have food trucks during holidays and special occasions.  Added a few more stages for performers and Dj's.
As most locals will tell you this is the place to go. I personally prefer Fremont Street over the strip. Many interesting people dressed as "characters", cheap drinks, and inexpensive food will definitely help stretch your entertainment dollar. Of course going in the evening will allow you to see the numerous music performances on the giant screen covering the entire street!. . During the summer you will always find live music and if it gets too hot you can duck inside for some cheap gambling!. . If you're new to the area or visiting and you want your picture taken with the numerous "characters" you find downtown or on the strip be sure to give them a buck or two... That's how they're making a living.
I'm a huge researcher and almost didn't go due to the bad reviews but I'm glad I went to see for myself! This is the experience I was expecting out of vegas! Bright lights, flashing signs, crazy flamboyant street walkers and side shows, people everywhere!  Yes I agree this is no place for children but in my opinion Vegas isn't for children anyway :/ take your kids to the lake or SeaWorld or 6 flags or disneyland!
Fun for the whole family! Well, to each his own... amirite? My boyfriend and I arrived at the wee hours of the morning (2:30 am - 4 am) on a Saturday/Sunday and the place was still bustling and surprisingly lively. There were an array of people ranging from tourists, locals, young, mature, couples, groups of friends, peeps riding solo, wild and loud (and even sketchy), down to the people watching types like ourselves. We even saw a bunch of youngins (ages baby - 5) with their parentals - it's freakin 3am! But it looked like everyone was having good ol wholesome fun watching the street performers sing and dance. . . We were both very entertained by the free flow street performer group that sang that night. There was a huge crowd of people circled around them. They did a great job energizing the crowd and getting people to dance. . . We enjoyed waking the street lined with shops, bars, restaurants, bright neon blinking lights and classic casinos. Overhead, I couldn't help but stare at the zip liners flying by (drunk and screaming). I'll admit, I waited until the next group flew by so that I could get a good snap shot of them and share with my friends on instagram. Seeing them dangle drunk and lifeless at the end is pure entertainment.. . We were completely magnetized and immersed in the whole old town Vegas vibe. The history of the casinos pulsed through our bodies as we walked into each one and explored. The deep culture of the city here is ecclectic and exuberant. Not to mention, we both felt that they did a good job maintaining the casinos and keeping them clean. . . In regards to safety, we saw many groups of police and casino security everywhere (on bikes and on foot). We even saw a group of friends break out into a fist fight with each other, but that didn't last too long - It was rather comical. Other than that, the people there were friendly and having a great time, making our night there a unique and fun night to remember!. . I would definitely recommend coming here at least once in your life, if you have never been and see it for yourself. Definitely worth seeing old town Vegas in all of its new town glory.
A must see attraction while visiting las Vegas they have live bands and a light show over the crowds.  Also theres a zip line which is only 20 bucks.  300 lb weight limit.  Deducted a star for overall cleanliness and another star for the various street performers and pan handlers there.  One guy was jist standimg there in a thong,  I mean the guy musta been 50.  I wonder if anyone took a pic of that.
Had a great time and there are several places to grab a cold beer -$2.50 for a 16 oz can. Plenty of casinos and food in the old area and with 3 stages and zip lines there is plenty to do. A little cooler under the canopy too!
The Fremont Street Experience has turned into a dump of nothing more then street beggars, drunks, homeless and thieves.  Not children friendly at all as it is very dirty with a host of inappropriate street performers.  There are so many other places to spend your money!. . I will never go there again.
Fremont Street is awesome! So much going on in one area! There was music performance each day I was there (3 visits). So many street performers. Man in a bikini, "nuns" with their boobs out, hip hop dance cruise, etc. There's also the zipline! And the famous light show on the ceiling. Seriously, your Vegas trip is not complete without a stop here.. . Don't forget to stop by Binion Casino to get your picture taken with $1,000,000. Free and barely any line! Takes 10 minutes to get the picture even though they say 30 minutes.
I've experienced this twice now and this recent time wasn't that great. The first time everything seemed to come to a stand still and everyone enjoyed the show. This last time I don't even think all the lights turned down like they did before. Hardly anyone seemed to realize the show was even happening.  Not as neat as I remember.
Most people I'm sure like this place. Some I'm sure hate it. Not for kids at night anyway. . I had great time. Very interesting place. Like Hollywood and Vine on steroids. Some things some would call inappropriate, gross and distasteful but I knew what to expect and had a great time.
The Fremont Street area has drastically changed in just the last 2 years since me and my husband's first visit. At that time it was super cool, still under construction, had the zipline which we rode (but nothing compared to the now SlotZilla setup), covered light shows, live music, street performers, cheap buffets, and great odd casinos. It was a true feel of old Vegas and we both decided the next time we visited LV we would stay at the Golden Nugget and take a cab to The Strip if we wanted to see a show or something (didn't happen). . . Anyway, Fremont is still all that...and more...getting borderline Disney now. :(  Packed on a week night at midnight...I guess people finally got word. Changes: At least three new casinos; another remodel to the Nugget - this one so vast the interior was almost unrecognizable; more chotsky-type tourist shops; tons more people; a few bucks extra for a beer on the street; and a lot more security.. . I am hesitant to say anything really great about it because I don't want it to continue to grow to the point where it's no longer "cool." So, the Fremont Street Experience sucks. So NOT worth the $25 cab ride. Just better off staying on The Strip. More to do and much more fun. Really, trust me...I always tell the truth. [OMgosh, is my nose actually growing?!]
This is great place to go with your friends and drink and have fun. whether we are just walking around drinking our own cheap beer on the street or to go to insert coins to get drunk and kick some ass at video games, this is an awesome time.
I love going here its something for everyone. I love going to have to live band and people watch!
