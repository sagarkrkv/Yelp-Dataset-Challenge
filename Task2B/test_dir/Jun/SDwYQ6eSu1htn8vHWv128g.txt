Enjoyed the dinner, but valet brought back my car with a ripped off rear view mirror.. First response from valet was we weren't responsible.  The dinner was fresh tasting, but above put a bad taste in my mouth.
Whats not to LOVE! A valley staple, and a must try anytime you are in the area
great bruschettas!
I liked the bruschetta.  It was fun sitting outside and enjoying the atmosphere.  Very trendy.  It was nice enjoying a meal while catching up with my girlfriend here.
Best bruschetta in town. Quirky, affordable, delicious wine selections. Perfect location. Postino's is my go to spot for a first date, to catch up with girlfriends, or for a later post-work drink and snack. . . I've never had anything that wasn't delicious there (the food and the wine are excellent). A+ across the board.
It is a very nice place but they kinda have you waiting for a little long after you're sat down.
went on June 8th with some girlfriends. we sat at end of bar due to 25 min wait for table.. Waiter had a condescending way of saying "you are going to eat here"?  . Then later everyone got food except me, he said I did not order and I know I ordered first. The girls were confused about what to order so I also helped them choose and he said he thought I was sharing with them. He asked if I wanted to order, first I said no and then decided I would.. Here is what ticked me off ..he said" I thought I would step back until you realized the stupid thing you said" I couldn't believe he would say that and from then on his service was absent.. food was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ....
Having lived at the Central Postinos last year, which was my home away from home, I ventured East hoping for the same experience. Well, while it was okay, I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus" Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad, our old fave, lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK, I am exaggerating, but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new, not skilled, whatever but come on, this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it, which I know is an easy fix, but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and decor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training.
I came here a couple times when I had a client in the area and I wish I had a chance to go more! We tried to go once during their happy hour one night and it was packed with a super long wait so we ended up not being able to stay. You could tell it was definitely the place to be. The bruschetta board was awesome and their salads are great too. The service was great, and they really want you to have the right wine that suits your tastes. You can even taste a little of the wine before you make a decision to choose one. I've been collecting wine corks for art projects and they gave me a whole wine bag full of them that I could take home with me. That was pretty awesome. I am definitely coming back to this place the next time I'm in Phoenix and definitely recommending it to my friends who visit Phoenix too!
my friend and i used to come here after hiking camelback.  you can't beat an excellent sandwich and sald w a crisp pitcher of beer or sangria.  we love the patio and the atmosphere along w the live musician they have on a sunday afternoon.
Superb customer service during our dinner at Postino Arcadia. There was not one person who was not smiling, friendly, helpful or customer focused. The host was busy when I came in so another server immediately jumped into help and seated our party. She then went and got us waters immediately while we waited for our server to come. We started with meal with the olives and then both had salads. I had the Hannah's Field Salad - Kale, quinoa, Fuji apple, apricot, toasted almonds, pecorino stagionato, and pickled red onion with apple cider-mustard vinaigrette. It was quite tasty, a little dry so maybe a splash more of vinaigrette, and the quinoa was cooked perfectly.  A nice blend of flavors and textures throughout. The place has a very nice wine, beer, beverage and cocktail list and you can even take a bottle of wine to go. The place looks like a converted gas station and they have outdoor seating and various seating areas inside.  Note:  Valet parking is $3 upon leaving.
Postino is delicious, reasonably priced and fun.  The only bummer is they don't have a full bar.
Monday and Tuesday nights they have a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. You can't beat that.  The bruschetta alone is normally $14.. . The servers were all very knowledgable about the menu and gave us great wine recommendations.
Great food. Unfortunately I haven't been back over here because it's so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation. I wish they would do something about it because I miss going there
I absolutely love positno! Has a very nice Ambience & Service is always great.  Great spot for a date or girls night out! Such a nice selection of wines. The only downside to this place would be that they don't have many options or dairy free or gluten free! Other than that it's a great place to sit and grab a glass of wine!
Great atmosphere and good food.  I had the roast beef panini and it was average, but the other stuff we ordered from the menu (e.g. bruschetta) was fantastic!  The service was outstanding.  Very relaxed place.
Postinos has some of the best bruschetta I've tasted. its a classy little bistro looking place with really good lemonade as well.  its not too expensive but its definitely not cheap either. I would recommend this for a lunch type of place but not too big of a dinner,
LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. . . What a great place this is! I mean wine and bruschetta? You can't get better then that!  . .  On Mondays Tuesdays they have a bottle of house wine and a bruschetta for $20!! What a steal! The only down side those days WILL be busy but it's totally worth the wait! (And you can start drinking your wine while you wait. They have little tables you can stand around or sometimes areas you can sit!)The outside patio at night is to die for! But it can be a bit noisy! . . Wonderful "girl night" get together spot!
Postino Arcadia was better than expected on a recent  visit.  On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh andwine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.  This was a great improvement from my last visit.
Great apps, wine and beer.  Can get a little crowded, so get there early in the evening if you can!
