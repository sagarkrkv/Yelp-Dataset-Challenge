Disclaimer: I am by no means a steak expert or a fine dining expert. I am a regular every day person who enjoys good food in a good environment with good service. I expect to receive a good experience based on what I pay. My credentials have no culinary background and I cook at home probably 3-4 times per week depending on how busy my work schedule gets.. . That being said, I had an amazing time a CUT.. . Food (5 Stars): There are a variety of steaks to choose from and the most expensive being the Wagyu beef, an amazing marbled piece of beef with fat infused in that allows the meat to melt in your mouth. I ordered the Rib-Eye wagyu beef which was a full 8-9 ounces of beef. Our group also ordered the sides that you can share: Creamed spinach, white asparagus, Japanese mushrooms, and potato fingerlings. All of these side orders were amazing. My favorite had to be the creamed spinach with the sunnyside egg on top. It complimented the steak well and I could've had more of it.. . Here comes the steak: a juicy succulent piece of steak charred and cooked to perfection! About half way through the steak, my friend said "It's so rich that I feel nauseous." Itwas so good and for those of us who have not been able to experience really good food on a regular basis, it can definitely be overwhelming. I would eat this steak again and again and again. I felt really full afterwards, but not sick to my stomach. It was majorly satisfying.. . Service (5 Stars): The waiter were great. They brought out cheese bread sticks, foccacia onion bread, and the pretzel bread that all went well with a great piece of cheese. They also joked around with us because I have this obsession with mayonaise. Overall, a friendly group that waited on us very well. They even included a little mini dessert for us which included a mini macaroon and chocolate bar. . . Bottom Line: It's a hefty price for fine dining, but it was worth it for the food and experience!
I give five stars for the food and two stars for the service which I guess averages my rating out to around three and a half, so since yelp doesn't allow half stars and the service was really an experience ruiner for us, I'm downgrading my rating to a three, which is really disappointing that bad service can ruin a delicious meal this much. . . So let me start with the food. Hub's and i had spent the last week hiking our butts off in some of the nearby national parks and wanted to treat ourselves to a delicious steak dinner and since we'd been meaning to try Cut for a number of months now and could never manage to get a reservation we decided it was time to pre-plan and give it a go. The food was mouthwatering - a choice of warm breads to start (my favorite was the pretzel bread), the appetizer, steak tartare, served with a quail egg and mustard, was so amazing we fought over who got the last bite! Our entrees, fillet mignon's for the both of us, were cooked to perfection and accompanied by creamy wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes with large chunks of smokey bacon  - to die for!! . . Service was disappointing and at times rude and dismissive, bordering on offensive. Upon arrival (we had a reservation) the hostess ignored us, we were sat in the corner of the restaurant right next to the kitchen even though the restaurant had many empty tables and upon asking to be moved were told they could not accommodate us, our waiter was dismissive and inattentive and even forgot our order and had to return to us and ask us to repeat it, our sides were brought out quite a while before our steaks and were almost cold by the time our steaks arrived and to top it all off the table next to us was fawned over and provided very attentive service by the same server. Now, I don't expect perfect service everywhere I go but when your paying $400 for a dinner you expect the service to be at a certain level - after all, in restaurants such as this, your not just paying for the food, your paying for an experience. . . There are too many amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas to deal with bad service and we will be taking our business elsewhere in future.
During my buddy's bachelor party, we decided to dine here for one night since we were staying at the Venetian.  We had originally made reservations for a party of 8 but later realized we didn't count a few people.  Luckily, Cut was able to accomodate us but instead of being in the dining room we were now seated out near the bar.  Service was as good as the BH location and the delicious parmesan bread sticks didn't disappoint.  After ordering a few bottles of wine for the group, the appetizers began coming out.  We ordered the bone marrow flan which didn't seem as flavorful as I remembered it being.  The beef carpaccio didn't disappoint!. . Ordered the prime rib eye http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#qwXO8aGWOqPqCo1jU93GWg along with a few sides for a few of us to share .... creamed spinach w/ organic egg, mac n cheese, and the sauteed mushrooms http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#hG1z92uuzB-O4bI1KQUGUA.  As with the location in BH, Cut has a tendancy to overcook their steaks so since I like my steaks rare, I order it black and blue.  Mentioned this to the other people in our group and a few listened and a few didn't.
Exquisite!  I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Cut at the Palazzo in Las Vegas. It was by far the best meal I've ever had! The ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the sauteed spinach was perfect and the warm blueberry upside down cake was delightful! As if amazing food wasn't enough, the attention to detail and genuine interest of the staff made my experience even more grand. I could use every superlative to describe Cut, and it would still be an understatement. Truly an amazing dining experience.
Went to the Cut last weekend with my gf. We made late reservations on a Monday. Want busy at all when we arrived. The service was absolutely amazing as we always had 2 to 3 people waiting on us. The presentation and thorough explanation of the meats before we order was very helpful and informative. Although prices were a bit steep, that was expected. The food was amazing! Steak was cooked to perfection. The sides were on point and my drink was made exactly how I ordered. Only issue was they ran out of the alcohol I wanted but that wasnt a big deal. Definitely going back soon! One of my favorite spots in Vegas!. . -Joe
I'm torn on Cut.  Some of my experience was great, other parts less than great.  . . One example were the servers.  Some were outstanding -- clearly of the standard you would expect in a high-end steakhouse, let alone one associated with Wolfgang.  Others were of the caliber you might find a Sizzlers.  Not that they were bad or rude, but more of the "I'm here to bring you your food.  Here it is.  Now shut up."  We would go through stretches of time wondering if anyone was coming for a drink order, next round, and so on.  The people who brought out the main course were top notch.  They knew their craft & wanted to make sure we were happy.. . Next less-than-positive:  What's with all the nickel & diming?  I'm $70 for a steak.  Do you really have to charge me a dollar for a sauce?  I mean, seriously.  When I visit fast food in bad parts of town, I get why they charge $.50 for extra sauce.  But here?  Seriously?  . . And no refills on soda? I guess that 12 cents they have to spend on syrup for soda would really set them back otherwise.. . Last complaint:  Of course you can request your steak at the standard raw/medium/etc., but I was surprised I couldn't get my steak "rare plus."  Given I find that in less prestigious steakhouses, I was surprised they wouldn't do it here.. . All that said, the meat itself was on par with what I would expect.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but very, very good.
As a local and a loyal Delmonico diner for almost 10 years, we decided it was high time we tried CUT: and I really liked it! The food was good, the presentation was imaginative and the service was some of the best at any restaurant I've ever been to. The atmosphere is very modern but not uncomfortable. (Ask for a booth as the regular tables and chairs looked not-so-pleasant). . . The prices are pretty high but the quality and presentation makes it (almost) worth it. Don't expect to get out of here without paying at least $200 on a dinner for two. We had 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 glasses of wine and 2 dessert and our total check was around $275.00 (before tip). We didn't go for the crazy expensive meat, just the "regular" filet mignon and bone-in ribeye. The steaks were good and the wood fired cooking gave them a nice flavor. The steaks come with a few different sides of mustards (I've never seen that before at a steakhouse). . . As others have noted, I found everything here to be extremely salty. It was like somebody knocked over the salt bowl into the food. I had the squash as a side and it was coated in salt. The steak was crusted with salt. The steaks came out with a small bowl of extra salt and a spoon! The butter for the bread is topped with salt, as is the bread itself (pretzel and foccacia is where it's at, ya'll)! If you are looking for a salt lick, this is the place for you. Next time I am going to ask them to tone down the salt in my food, it was almost unbearable but not to the point of making the food inedible.. . The wine list is abysmal but we were told the corkage fee if you bring your own wine is a very steep $50 (that's what the French Laundry in Napa Valley charges)! Luckily there were some good options of wines by the glass -- we opted for the Hall cabernet for $19 a glass. Totally worth it.
All I can say is WAGYU!!!! Melt in your mouth deliciousness with great selection of house made sauces to pick from. I prefer their meats to the other high end places in town. A beautiful restaurant, great service, and fabulous steaks!!! This is my favorite steakhouse on the strip. Plus it's not crazy loud inside so you can still hear the people at your table.
As far as high end steakhouses goes, Cut is one of the best. Order your steak rare to medium rare and you will have a fine meal.  What brings me back to this place is the kobe steak sashimi.  No gastronomical adventure in Vegas is complete without this dish.  If you're a carnivore, it is not to be missed.  If I could eat only one thing in Vegas, it would be this.
The service was great. However the food was much less impressive. We both ordered filet mignon medium rare. The steaks were overcooked and I saw some pink, but it's more like medium than medium rare. The steaks were also dry. I have had much better steaks elsewhere. The side (we ordered potatoes) was also just so-so and nothing special about the cocktails neither. . . CUT just didn't cut it!
The steak, apps, and sides were all delicious. However the rude service provided by the manager was very disturbing to say the least. The food runners brought the steaks out and mixed the steaks giving the me the medium well steak when I ordered a medium rare steak and giving the medium rare steak tosomeone who ordered medium well. When we told the waitress she brought the steaks back to be corrected. The manager then brings out the medium well steak to show us and pretty much "test" our integrity by asking if this is how we wanted it cooked. He then proceeded to try to tell us that this is a medium rare steak when the steak was definitely not as rare as the steak that everyone else was eating. We came here to enjoy a great meal, however this manager ruined our experience. We will definitely never be coming back EVER again or refer this place to anyone.
Just an FYI. If you make a reservation through the Yelp App - that's through OpenTable.com - you will not receive the points on Open Table. It's that tiny little disclaimer that no one tells you about and I found out after reading Open Table's website. I think that is ridiculous but that's a whole different topic in itself.. . I've eaten at Cut while at a Bachelor party but eating with a group of guys is obviously different than eating with your lady who doesn't really eat steak. The service was remarkable - from the hostess to the multitude of servers. Our server brought out various cuts of meat and informed us of the process for each one. You could tell the server really liked his job because of his enthusiasm for each cut. . . I ended up getting the Petit Filet, a ton of sides and a nice Gin cocktail. We also ordered some wine and their sommelier brought out a new wine machine that pokes a hole into the cork of the wine bottle so they wouldn't have to open up the entire bottle for one customer. We were their guinea pig (or they said) and it was her first time doing a table side opening. It's an interesting concept but if you do not have an open bottle to compare the two, the whole thing is kind of pointless. . . Besides the steak, their seasonal corn was probably the best thing on their menu. The server highly recommended it and I would so as well. Their corn was so simple yet so flavorful (only flavored with olive oil, salt & pepper, sugar). I would probably pass on their creamy spinach and it honestly did not need the egg on top. . . It was a very nice meal and I would definitely come back.
Wow.. make a reservation.  Pretty pricey BUT   the food was great.  and the service was outstanding!      You definitely pay for what you get... you do pay a lot but the service was fantastic.   It's not a casual place.. it you take a casual approach to this, you won't fully appreciate it.
