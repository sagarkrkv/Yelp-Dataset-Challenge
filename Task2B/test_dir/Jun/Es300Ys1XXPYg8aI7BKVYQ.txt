Great atmosphere with the indoor and outdoor space. The overall layout of the place really works, as the option to roam outside gives much needed breathing room throughout the night without having to leave. People are friendly, there's lots of space (relatively speaking) to roam around and meet new people. Good music. We danced here all night. It was a lot of fun.
Went here with my girlfriend to see Tiesto during the winter. We pre-bought tickets so we immediately got in. That should be a given but some of the other clubs make it difficult to get in even with tickets (ex. Chateau Nightclub at the Paris). . This club has a cool setup with it being half indoors and half outdoors and the dj booth built in to the wall in between.. . Very cool club and they do a good job of free pouring drinks so they are not as expensive as other places.. . Make sure to get there early though if you want to dance without feeling like a sardine.
More a 3.5. Definitely the nicest venue I have seen for a club on the strip.  Loved the indoor/outdoor option.  Stayed outside most of the night, it was a mild night around upper 70's or low 80's but it was a bit windy. Reason for a 3.5, the music was terrible!!!!  It was all techno, and maybe I'm just not a fan of that type of music.  The drinks were pricey around $15-$18 per drink. The outside gaming was a great option for people, but the tables had a high minimum of around $25 per hand. All in all I see the appeal to this club.  If I get in for free again like I did this time. I might go back.
Buy pre-sale tickets.  Once you show it to the bouncer, you skip EVERY line.  I've never gotten into a club that fast before.  It only took 5 minutes to get into the club.  Now, the bar line, thats a whole different story.... . Since the last time I came to XS years ago, the music and type of dancing has changed a lot.  Its much more of the EDC crowd so its not much of the traditional "grinding with a girl" anymore.  So much more jumping up and down and telling the person next to you how awesome the (insert celebrity DJ) and (insert B-rated celebrity next to him) is.. . The venue size-wise is really big and the grand entranceway makes you feel like an A-lister.  And the pool area gives guests a breather from the hot sweaty mess that is inside.  Warning though, the last few times it was cold and windy out there.  On the plus side, there's a bar and some gambling tables in the pool area in order to hang out for a little bit and not fight with the bar line inside.  We got table service outside last time but we probably wouldn't do it again.  All the girls got really cold sitting down in their thin dresses.  The solution was either a boyfriend or more alcohol, both of which was fine for the guys.  . . Only thing I can knock on this place are the creepy wall fixtures.  Reminds me of Han Solo frozen in carbonite.  But instead, all naked women looking like they're in pain.
I don't see what all the Hype is about XS Tryst or Surrender, they're all pretty lame to me. XS does have all the newest and popular Dj's perform there such as Calvin Harris Steve Aoki Will I Am Lil Jon Avicii and Hardwell. That's good if you like that kind of music, they don't play rap or hip hop so you won't have worry about any ratchetness. 80 percent of the girls that go here are ridiculously hott !!!!! The other 20 percent are old decent looking  rich cougars lol. The one thing that really pissed me off was when   I went to the bar to get my drinks for me and my girl and my card was declined. I was like WTF I just got paid how the hell did my card get declined. I spent all the cash I had on me buying my homie some drinks and leaving tips. I asked the bartender to try the card again and she said no. I gave her the drinks back and said ok  forget it I don't know why my card is being declined, I had a couple thousand in the bank so I know I was good. She acted like I was trying to pull a fast one and called security over to the bar. I explained the same thing to him but he didn't give a shit either. So he tells me and I quote " normally we kick people out for trying to buy drinks and the their card declines but imma let u slide my N***A just don't come back to the bar." I was like first off I am not anybody's N***a I'm Cuban u fuck and second why do I need to be told not go back to the bar obviously I understand that my card isn't working why would I go hang out at the bar. Just because the  Wynn is full of Rich white people doesn't mean that you have to treat other people like minority scum. At the end of it all my card started working when I went outside the club to use the ATM to get money out. Chase Bank said their system went down and some people were unable to use their debit cards. Not returning to this club that's for sure.
Hands down, this is probably my favorite nightclub in Vegas so far. . . The breakdown: . . Venue: I am so glad XS has both an indoor and outdoor area, which means more room to breathe!  I am so glad I do not have to be gasping for air anymore! Personally, I like the outdoor area a lot more because there is more room to dance and people are also allowed to stand in the shallow parts of the pool which provided my aching feet with some relief. Darn those heels....  During my second time here during Memorial Day weekend,  people actually jumped into the pool with their clothes on and they did not get kicked out of the club so if you are down for that than be my guest but don't  take my word for it because I am not for certain if this is acceptable or not!. . Drinks: Both times here, my girls and I got free complimentary drink tickets so that was awesome! On top of that, they were redeemable for any drinks that was up to a $20 value so say hello to the AMF's and Sex on the Beach! . . Music:  I have seen Diplo and David Guetta here. I cannot really comment much on Diplo because I probably only stayed an hour or so that day but David Guetta is definitely good at what he does. I literally dance until his set ended! . . Okay, after reading through this review you are probably wondering why I did not give this place a 5-star review  right, well the reason behind why is because during my first time here I was almost punched in a face by a drunk guy, some drunk girls trampled my feet causing  bruises that took forever to go away  and on top of that I had a bouncer shove me so hard that I fell back onto my friend, definitely did not appreciate that SIR!!. . Overall, a really nice club when I am in the outdoors !!
First of all LOL at "AJ S." review from June 3 about how his card was declined because Chase bank went down LOL! Anyway, place is awesome but I have some complaints I want to air anyway. Bartenders are terribly slow and most of them are bitchy. I think they are slow on purpose and they move with zero urgency when the bar is 4 people deep all the way around. If you are a bartender there and youre not bitchy or slow than this doesnt apply to you. Im only talking about the 3 that I encountered. Twice it took almost 30 minutes to get a drink. Bouncers up front and outside are not bad, the ones inside were rude morons. If you bounce there and are not a rude moron than this doesnt apply to you. Im only referring to the few that I observed. Saw a black lady security guard shoo a bunch of girls from a blackjack table as if they had no right to be in there. Listen honey, people pay big money to come to XS and spend even more on the inside. Treat them with respect.
Although our promoter told us we are free entrance, he failed to tell us that we were free for outdoor lounge club scene. Not the actual club inside.. . But it was still very good and wild. There was a lot of room and we got to jump in the pool without getting kicked out. . . Overall, it was a very fun experience.
Staying at the Wynn, you would think they could treat us decently. The Asian door guy is SO rude and miserable. Two hot girls we didn't want to pay a cover on a Sunday night for an hour and were already on the guest list, politely asked if it could be waved because we are hotel guests and were told 'there is the exit, leave.' by the door guy!! What horrendous service!
Its been a while since I've gone to XS but I swear that this place never fails!. . I'd say that XS has the best night swim experience! During the summer time they have a night swim on Sundays. My most recent experience was to go see Skrillex on their opening night. They have giant floaties and the water is warm. The pool is good in size and it doesn't get over crowded from my last experience. Gotta go to these night swims! It's better than being in vegas hot weather for those beach clubs without any shade and getting sunburned if you have no bottle service. BOO for sunburns!. . My more recent trip to XS, we had a table going into see RL Grimes. The crowd is always welcoming. I'd suggest if you want somewhere to sit to pick up bottle service. But otherwise XS is one of the better clubs and one of my favorites behind Light. The decor behind the bar consist of bodies of women. Also, I don't get stepped on so badly at this club either because its roomy enough.
One of the most beautiful venues in Vegas. Went there on a Saturday night when ZEDD was performing, it was an amazing night, crowd is energetic, and pool side is perfect. Their sound and light systems are near perfect. Line could be long if you don't have reservations but it's the norm for Vegas and for one of the top 10 Dj's.
Definitely the best club I've been to in Vegas. Went on a Saturday night to see Zedd dj. It was packed, inside and outside. The male-female ratio was pretty even. Drinks are pretty expensive, unless you're a gambler under the patio, then it's kinda free, lol. We didn't wanna stay inside the actual club so we went out and found a spot to the side of the stage. It was PERFECT. Better to be outside because it was hot but cool breezes, it's not super crowded like inside and the view's just better. Some people were swimming/dancing in the pool, it was nice! A lot of girls just took off their heels and stood in the pool and danced, lol. The only lame thing is that, they don't have their celeb DJ come out until like 1:30. But since we got into the club (VIP style :) at midnight, we didn't have to wait too long. In the super VIP area around the stage, you know the area that costs like 50 thousand to get, Steve Aoki was there to support Zedd! It was dope. Two super hott djs in one area! . . Overall, the whole night was pretty fucking dope; getting into the club VIP style (through the back), gambled and went on a winning streak, free drinks all night, and had great spots outside to see Zedd and Steve Aoki.
I think a 3.5 star is fair. This is by far the most elegant club that I have been to in Las Vegas. Everything is so upscale and very classy. You have the option of being outside or inside. During my visit I was outside, the wind was kind of blowing at night but a few drinks will keep you nice and toasty. There is a gambling section outside but you have to be a high roller to play. . . One of the downsides to this place is the music. Waaay too much edm style and house music. Can't really get your freak on to some hip hop or rap jams.. . Very cool place, great vibe, drinks start off around 15 bucks. I got in via a promoter so hecut me a deal for 40 bucks for me and 40 for my buddy (dude). My girlfriend was able to get in for free and another female friend of mine got in for free as well. Normally the cover is 50 for dudes and 30 for girls. Find a promoter and get the hookups.
Craziest and best club in Vegas, enjoy the club scene and have your own space .
Been going to XS for three years now and I'm confident to say that this is one of the best clubs in the world. I've been all over the world and have partied in all the hot spots including Ibiza. Great layout, draws a classier and very HOT crowd. Plenty of room to dance and the night swims during pool season are EPIC. . . I just hope they revamp their dj residency. Avicii is old.
Amazing place. Love the outside/inside aspect of it and it's luxury venue makes it an awesome experience. Top Dj's in the world as well.
My husband & I are in our 40's.  WE HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT!!  It's even a Tuesday night! Friendly Staff,Dance floor fills up fast and like any Vegas club it gets a little pushy shovy on the floor but not real bad.  The bouncers were great and just kept moving people around insteadof standing in the walk ways.  The guards/bouncers do a great job and are all friendly.  If any girl feels shes being bothered by a guy or she's had too much to drink or needs to leave the club, the guards will help the girl out no problem and with respect.   To me it was a crazy fun night and guys were good for the most part (but when they get drinking too much just stay close the the outter edge of the dance floor and the guards will help out you as long as you alert them to an issue.  Otherwise they have no idea you don't like something or your being bothered. . . All in All it's  A REAL FUN CLUB
The most elegant and luxurious venue I've ever been to. Major Lazer played on Sunday night and the crowd went wild. Our bottle service promoter, busser, and server were all very professional and helpful. Even the security was friendly!. . Gentlemen, this club has really fkin hot girls. . Ladies, the men that come here look a bit old...
Of the many clubs I had went to, this is one of my few favorites. Almost every bachelorette party, this would be a stop even my own bach party was here and I had a blast! What I love most is the outdoor pool area. You are allowed to sit on the beds (first come first serve) that is on the edge of shallow water and you would see most of the girls take off our shoes and dance in the water without bouncers yelling and pulling everyone out etc like other places probably would've done. For ANY women wearing high heels....this is heaven!! The only downfall is DO NOT fall in or jump into the pool. Its already nice they allow people to sit on the beds (without additional charges, like many other clubs) and put your feet in water but if your IN your also going to be OUT! Sounds mean but I can totally understand its a safety and security issue. . . Inside the club can be extremely crowded so being able to be outdoors to socialize or catch a breath with the same type of music also playing nice and loud outside is definitely a place for me. So, I LOVE this place. Staff are extremely friendly and tries to help and accommodate. Unlike other places I have been at, there are absolutely no where to sit unless you buy a table/bottle service. Pretty much a feel as if, "no money, too bad...either you stand all day or you can leave so we can charge another person to take your space in the club" kind of thing. Not here. Almost every club will be crowded no doubt but because this place has plenty of seating and space....you will always have a space to stand/sit and breathe.. . On the dance floor, I would constantly see bouncers doing their job directing traffic and other employees running to the dance floor trying to clean any wet areas, pick up bottles that were thrown there etc. Unlike another hot and popular venue I had went to, bottles would be everywhere and people would trip on the wet floors but with all the bodies rubbing against you in every corner, it will hold you up. No one would clean the dance floor. Why, because they would not have made there way in there as its WAY overcrowded. Which all you see is a herd on the dance floor and not the dirty floor with bottles anyway. Which tells you something. Safety issues and a total fire hazard.. . So of other clubs I have went to, I LOVE this place and definitely a club of choice! Just talking about it,  I miss this place already!
Great dj got here around 1:00 am left at sunrise . People were getting in the pool at 4 am in the morning so much dancing and great memories . Avicci keeps u going with energy . Always wanted to see him live now I have .
Absolutely the WORST club I have EVER been too. Service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity. I love going out but I will not be returning here.
I love XS, fun place, always has good DJ's...however I hate how recently they have been splitting the indoor part of the club from the outdoors...it was def way better when u had the freedom to go between the two areas freely, let's not forget a lot of people r there to have a good time and meet people. Very very crowded, one time I even left 10mins in to Avicii's show (whom is my favorite artist)..so if you know me you know that's saying a lot. With that being said, I still enjoy this place and always seem to find a way to have a good time!
Came here on a Saturday night at about 11:45 PM. Through Instagram, my friend started communicating with a club promoter (Dexrod_LasVegas) and us girls (4 of us) got in for $20 each with VIP service once inside through the promoter, as long as we would consistently tip the (mostly female) servers. . . So, there was no line and we entered the venue quickly.. . The indoor area is spacious, the lighting is dim and flattering, the outdoor area is also spacious- and has a pool. The view outdoors is pretty: you see the Encore hotel and lights illuminated against the night sky, and the pool water just reflects all the lights and glimmers in-between your bare, resting toes freshly nude from the heels you just tossed aside - I wore stilettos this night and, never again! . . Altogether fun night, Lil' Jon was DJing, and the stage was positioned on a threshold where the stage is halfway indoors, and halfway out. We would migrate from dancing indoors to outdoors and vice versa. Many good-looking ladies and gentlemen were here: some were celebrating bachelor and bachelorette parties, while some were just celebrating! Cheers.
Been here a few times and always had a good time. If you plan on going hit up Bobby Yeadon for table service. Responds to you and is up front about  prices.
Came here Monday night for a post EDC party with Skrillex and Diplo DJIng. By far the most epic of times, people were everywhere, pool was filled with hot girls, actually the whole place was filled with hot girls. Like model quality. It was surreal, Diplo played for hours, Cuba Gooding Jr. fell asleep standing up while Pauly D was laughing on. What a place, if you go to Vegas you NEED to go here.
Ok, who doesn't like XS? There is nothing to complain here. I came on a night where I didn't like the headliner (Lil' John), but I still had lots of fun. When there is a huge pool outside, you cannot complain. And when there are people jumping into it with their clothes/dresses on, that is even better! Let me just say this club is huge. Compared to Marquee and all the other clubs I've been to so far (Hakkasan, Light, Tao, Tryst), this has to be my favorite so far. . . They have enough room indoor and outdoor so that you don't feel to cramped up like how it is at other clubs. And what do you know, Lil' John plays EDM. That's pretty funny in my opinion, although he doesn't transition the songs that well. I've had a whole argument with my friends whether Lil' John is good or not, but that's a whole different subject. . . Overall, my experience here was great. I would definitely come back again.
I guess this place could be fine if you're just going for a night dancing in vegas. I would definitely not buy tickets to see any of your favorite artists here. The dance floor is small and surrounded by tables. Everyone at the front tables stands up on the back of the booths so you can't see who is performing. This is a typical night club in Las Vegas with douche security guards which is something that everyone has to deal with out there. . . We bought tickets to see Skrillex, Diplo, and RL Grime then staked out a spot nice and early. The whole night we had an asshole security guard constantly telling our group to move over even though we weren't blocking anyone and the complete opposite side had people standing in the walkway and dancing. He also kept yelling at girls that were getting up by the poles to dance saying they were blocking his friends tables view even though they were behind him. He should of yelled at the table in front of his friends table but I guess they don't like girls dancing? Just lame. . . Ok for going out fora night, you'll regret paying to see a show here though.
Get there early or else you'll never get near the dance floor. I definitely e joyed the vibe. Audio system is amazing, security was kind, drinks are pricey but that's Vegas for you. I did like how girls got in for free and even got a complimentary drink.
The most dissatisfying experience I've ever had in Vegas. I came to celebrate my 22nd birthday with my best friend. We were confirmed for the guest list, but we were promptly held up by the ID checkers, who claimed that we looked nothing like our photo IDs. They proceeded to ignore our offers to show our credit cards matching our IDs, and called a bouncer over. They gave our perfectly legitimate IDs to the bouncer, who also looked them over, then glared at us and shoved our IDs to us, saying "don't ever come back here using these again". Needless to say, my friend and I were upset. We attempted to talk to someone in charge, but they all looked away uncomfortably and said that whatever the bouncer says, goes - unless we happened to be carrying our passports. Neither of us have EVER had this happen to us before, so of course we were not carrying our passports with us. The manner in which the staff treated us (completely legal customers) tonight was atrocious and offensive. The fact that they rudely dismissed us as if we were guilty was infuriating, as we had done absolutely nothing wrong.
One of the Best! Love this place, Music was great! House Music mostly or at least the night we went. Went in March right before the pool parties started =/ ugh Just another reason to go back I guess! If your going to go here find Yaseen! He is a promoter there and took care of me and my girls when we were out. Walked us in, got drink tickets and a table. He's super nice and promotes at a few other places which is helpful since your gonna wanna hit a few different spots. By far one of my favorite clubs...
First time ever clubbing with my fiance who isn't really a party person and doesn't dance, so I was expecting us to have a good time not a GREAT time. And that's exactly what we had a GREAT time it was so much fun and you feel so welcomed there. The club is So beautiful! And good looking people too! We both can't wait to be back!
Xs is one of my favorite clubs because it's so pretty and spacious but over the past few years the club has been a sell out. They pack in way too many people than they should and the headliner djs don't even come on until 2am and even then their set is only a couple hours. . . If you get a chance go on Sunday nights in the summer for their night swim!
I went here this past Sat night with a girl friend who goes to clubs all over the USA.  We both agreed this club is over hyped and very unsafe.  Plus the music experience is average.  The lead DJ was DeadMau5...he was horrible.  Music wasn't dance worthy and have no clue why he even has a fan base.. . Here is the unsafe part.  It was so over crowded that people on the dance floor couldn't dance.  People were literally crammed onto the floor and couldn't move.  The same thing happened in the other public areas.  It is a fire trap waiting for a disaster to happen.  Then a large fight broke out and really destroyed the mood.  This club is not worthy or representative of the Wynn brand.. . I agree with my friend that a club which has a  clientele that fights should never get our money. Wynn really needs to re visit their club operations before a real tradegy occurs.
