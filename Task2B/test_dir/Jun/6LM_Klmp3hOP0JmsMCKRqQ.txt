Can't complain, too much. Stayed here two nights.. . We had a pyramid suite.  It was quiet and well kept as far as I could tell.  . . Minus the dirty glass on the deck of the soaking tub.... . . Huge Sidenote:. **I am not a gambler.  We did our fair share of poking our heads into other casinos: Excalibur and Mandalay Bay are on either side of Luxor , we also stopped into Caesars Palace.  We were only staying for two nights, which was more than enough time to get the feel of the Strip (meh...). . **Excalibur's lobby/casino looked like a glammed up Knights Inn--super goofy/campy/goth/dark. . **Mandalay Bay had a great restaurant that we had lunch at (Border Grill) BUT the entire casino/lobby/shopping area SMELLED like someone farted, lit a cigarette and then sprayed Coconut body spray to cover it up!!! How nasty is that?????. . -Anyway, unlike Mandalay, Luxor smelled like heaven.  I got very little ashtray funk walking through and whilst playing penny slots   . . -Staff members were incredibly helpful/friendly. . -Prices were your usual inflated ridiculousness for one of the world's largest tourist traps  . . -Who cares if there are three-thousand Starbucks in the lobby/casino.  I am not paying $5 for a tall anything
Rooms definite in need of upgrade.  It's old and very dated.  Things are falling apart and I was in the Tower.  It's construction gut time.  . . Staff has a "your here because it's cheap" attitude.  Check in process, casino floor staff, drink servers and housekeeping all have it.  . . I made the mistake of the buffet one morning.  That was a wasted experience.  Food was at least hot.  Bland but hot.  But it was the service attitude that ruined it for me before I even sat down.
Oh my god. Still waiting in line to check in over an hour later. This is a joke, right? Thank you Luxor management.
The personnel were great. They were very friendly and accommodating. Our room however was not very kept up. The sink drain leaked, the wardrobe cabinet had a stripped knob, the center light didn't work, the tv had no high definition, the wired internet was not free and the elevators were limited on the higher floors so you had to walk quite a ways. The self park was also quite a distance. You would think a place that freely takes your money would have a more updated environment. The restaurants were over priced, and the food wasn't that great. We tried the buffet at the Rio and it was much better (the seafood buffet) than at the Luxor.
It is a great hotel for the price!  It's quiet on the room floors with great showers and comfy beds.  It's much better than other hotels in the strip fire the same price.
Arrived Monday,  quick check in and then we got up to our standard room.  After settling in I went to turn the TV on and it wouldn't come on,  I diagnosed the problem to an unplugged cord.  As I went to plug it in I spotted two syringes laying behind the center,  the wife called the front desk to inform them and they moved us to a suite room.  . Suite room was much nicer and we had no issues with the room except during the heat of the day the a/c couldn't keep up.  Will say several times the door lock acted up but once I informed the front desk they repaired it.  Internet,  I could never get the network to go,  so why charge a fee for something that doesn't work?  Irritating! . . We were without our kids on this trip and I don't think I'd bring them here as I think they'd get bored as there isn't much here to keep their attention.
For all the tough reviews on the Luxor, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the hotel was quite nice inside the lobby. Gaming machines are the same everywhere and the food is always going to be mediocre at a Casino. The room I was in was a Pyramid Suite and it was very large, especially for the rate. The hot tub was nice. The bed was comfortable. There was a good size fridge in the second sitting room. The bathroom was also bit, but you needed to have arms the length of a gorilla to reach the toilet paper, which was really my only complaint. They need to get WiFi.
Booked two rooms for my mom and aunt. The rooms were fine, staff was bad and  good. We had one big problem with the reservation, which left a sour taste in my mouth. I had the call recorded and that saved my mom the extra sixty seven dollars.  Besides that I can't say too much positive, as the hotel needs some upgrades, and the buffet was not provided as promised. Finally the pool was filthy. I like the RIO pool way better. The Luxor needs work, as does the staff, and wait to check in.
Took another trip to good old Las Vegas. What can I say it's my fav getaway spot and it's an hour flight. Too easy. Anywho review time. . . This time I stayed at The Luxor which was a long time coming because I love Egyptian things and the theme is my favorite one there. Based on some of the reviews I saw I did not know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Despite it being one of the older places on the strip I still enjoyed it very much. Time to break it down. . . Check in: . I arrived in Vegas about 5:00 so the line to check in was very long since it is a popular time to check in. I thought I would be standing there forever but it moved very quickly because they had plenty of people working to accommodate the line so that was a plus.  I originally booked a standard pyramid room but upon check in the guy checking me in upgraded me to a room in the east tower for free so of course I took it. He asked me if a room on the 13th floor was ok just in case I was superstitious or something and I am not so it was ok. I thought it was nice for him to think of that and ask though. He was very polite and he checked me in quickly. I was happy with that process. . . The Room: . I stayed in room 13307 and honestly it was a pretty standard room but it was a nice room. They stayed true to the theme which I like. That's part of the fun for me., The bed was very very comfortable. Huge fluffy pillows which I love and the sheets were very soft. The bathroom was a very nice size and it had a separate tub and shower which was cool. The water temp and pressure in the shower was good. No complaints there. . It was pretty hot there so I used the AC alot and it worked great. In fact at times I had to turn it down or off because the room got so cold. Overall I enjoyed the room very much and was pleased with what I got. . . Customer Service:. I ordered room service on the first night because I was beat and I got that quickly but the food was just ok though. It was the steak sandwich with some coleslaw. The coleslaw was nasty and the sandwich was so so but I was so hungry and tired I just ate it and went to sleep. Before  could order room service I noticed my room did not have a menu so I called the front desk and they sent one up promptly. The customer service I received at the hotel when I needed it was good. . . The Pool:. I was not too impressed with the pool. They have two pools but one you have to pay to be in and there was like two people in that one. But the free pool was so crowded and there was barely anywhere to put my stuff I almost should've went to the paid area, The water was pretty cold but once you got used to it it was not so bad. I did not stay very long. . . Casino:. The casino was like any other. Very easy to get lost in this place but fun nonetheless. I played alot of blackjack and for the most part the dealers were cool. There was one that pissed me alot though. She tried to say I asked for another card when I didn't and had the nerve to yell and raise her voice to me. I would not budge and they ended up taking my side. I loved the part where she said they could review the cameras if they needed to and I told her to bring it. I said yes let's review the cameras so they can see that I put my hand forehead and did not put my hand anywhere near the table to signal that I wanted another card. I knew what I did and I knew I was right so bring it. I loved how the cameras were no longer something she used to threaten me after that.  I just find it unbelievable that she spoke to me that way and would not own up to her mistake. Then when the relief came to the table she starts talking shit to about me to her in Vietnamese thinking that I don't understand what she is saying, By the way she was staring and the hand gestures toward me she was making I could figure it out. She was very very rude and should learn that when someone puts their hand on their forehead that does not mean "hit me" She needs to get another job that does not involve people. Other than that moron I had a great time in the casino. One rotten apple did not spoil the bunch for me. Only regret is I did not get her name and make a formal complaint. . . Other:. There are alot of restaurants and plenty of stores to get the little things you need throughout the casino. There is a food court up stairs if you are looking for something fast, cheap and easy. There are two little convenient stores called Essentials and 24/7 that are open 24 hours for your convenience if you need anything. They have Starbucks as well. So basically anything quick and extra you might need is at your finger tips here which is great. They also have alot of shopping here as well if you want to get gifts or souvenirs. . . Overall I really enjoyed my stay here. The price is great and I just like this hotel and I will definitely be staying here again once I get through my list of places I want to stay. If you are looking for a good room for an inexpensive price then stop by her
I stayed 3 nights at the Luxor with my wife and 8 year old son. We drove up from Laughlin, so arrived at check in at 1 PM. Check in is a 3PM. It was Wednesday, so I figured there would be a room available, and there was. But the Luxor's policy is you must wait until 3PM, or pay $20 to enter room early. Paying for late check out I can certainly understand and have paid in the past, but I have never had a hotel charge to enter an otherwise vacant room a couple hours early in the afternoon. We paid the $20, no big deal. . We went into the room and found the internet was a 20 foot long crinkly wire that came out from behind the TV. No wireless internet. I had not seen a wired internet since my last hotel stay in a 3rd world country. Luckily I had my trusty laptop, but our Ipad was useless except for our 8 year old being able to play a game. . The flat screen TV was inside a closet with large doors that opened outward only 90 degrees. Which means you must sit directly in front of the TV to watch it, or the doors are in the way. Why not just remove the doors?. As others have mentioned, there were pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. Perhaps the cleaning staff keep a jar of them to sprinkle around for ambiance, I don't know. There was also some kind of yellow chunky stuff stuck to the wall next to the toilet. . My wife brought our 8 year old son to the pool. About 108 degrees outside. You want shade? Another $20. The room itself is inexpensive, so no big deal.. Worst experience was when my wife brought our son back to the room from the pool. Her key would not work. She called me to come to the room and try my key instead of going downstairs with our son and waiting in the check in line for a new key. I was eating at the Excalibur and had just received my food. I told her to keep trying and I would hurry eating and be there as soon as I could. I ate fast and went to the room. Pretty long walk. When I got to the room, my key would not work either. We went back down to the long check in line in the lobby. We waited in line again and at the counter we talked to  a receptionist who was apparently having a bad day. She told us the keys would not work because we had mishandled them and thus demagnetized them  She strongly suggested we should have known better and had we not been so careless with our keys, we would not have suffered this inconvenience. . When I asked her if it was then all our fault, she said she would not talk to me anymore since the room was reserved in my wife's name. She then asked me "Who are you to this woman? Are you even with her? I'm not talking to you." Maybe she thought my wife had just met me on the Strip.. We then asked to speak to a manager. We were directed to the front desk manager on duty at that time. The manager was very polite and apologetic. We got our keys straightened out and had no more key problems. She even comped us $50 to use at the buffet.. I would have given the Luxor one more star had the first receptionist not been so rude and surly. . The Luxor was the least expensive hotel on the Strip when we checked. But next time I will spend a little more and hopefully get a better hotel.
I stayed here last weekend with a few friends. It was for a bachelor party, we got a suite and the adjoining room in the East tower. . -NO WIFI! None. Unless you're in the main lobby, there is zero WiFi in The Luxor. . -Suite bedroom AC was busted making it literally too hot to sleep in. The staff changed our room which was kind of them. . -All furniture felt it was one heavy sneeze away from breaking. . -TV's were old and showed static-y channels. . -Several beaten up things around the hotel: broken elevator buttons, cracked glassware, rickety elevators, stains on walls, broken door locks, etc. . -Located on the South end of the strip. If you feels like leaving that area, it's a pain. . -Seriously rude valet service. . . I have stayed at worse places, but barely. The Luxor is no longer the pinnacle it used to be, and refuses to advance like many other hotel / casinos around it. For the price you're paying, go for the Mid-North (near Treasure Island) part of the strip; same rates,  closer to popular areas, and in better shape. The only reason this didn't get a 1 star is because the main staff were very helpful and courteous.
I was between a 3 and 4 star review here. . . Location in South Strip is pretty nice-- everything is pretty walkable. I haven't stayed at Luxor since I was a kid, so I didn't remember much of how the rooms were. We only ended up with a room on the 4th floor with a poolside view. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The people with me complained that the pillows were toobig so they ended up not using them. They were fine to me!. . Room itself was just a bit loud. They had the window cleaners working at around 7-8am (which is too early for Vegas!) and the ropes kept hitting the window, so it woke us all up. Additionally, the music from the pool traveled up so we could hear it on the 4th floor. . . Overall, I think the room was pretty spacious, but I don't think they did an amazing job of cleaning since some trash we accidentally left on the floor remained there after the cleaning. Room ended up being around $60/night for 2 queen beds, so for 2 nights, we each only paid $30. No wifi (free wifi for guests in public areas). . . Not the most glamorous hotel, but I would say it's of great value.
Not 5 seconds after stepping into the Luxor, we had what seemed to be an extremely helpful lady come to us and ask if we needed help. She ushered us over to a counter where another lady began hammering us with an offer to stay free for a number of nights later in the year, all they needed was my credit card. I don't like to be rude but she wouldn't take no for an answer. We finally just walked away in disgust. If I want to stay at a hotel I will ask YOU, don't start badgering me with supposed FREE offers.
I have stayed at Luxor many times in the past, but am now writing my first review. They have definitely did some remodeling and upgrades since the last time I stayed here and it looks a bit different than before all for the better especially the lobby.. . The check-in was a quick process with not much of a line and the gal who checked us in wasnice and even gave us an upgrade to a tower room. The checkout process was even quicker with an advanced iPad system in the lobby done all by yourself without having to wait in the long checkout line.. . The room was spacious and was kept clean. It isn't as fancy as the Wynn or Bellagio, but for what we paid for it, it was worth it. It even came with a decent view of a small section of the pool. The room was very quiet and I never heard any of neighbors from either side.. . We spent a few hours at the pool and it wasn't too busy since it was very hot mostly the whole day we were there with temps in the 100's. Good size pool for wading in, but too small to swim in.. . The have a newly remodeled food court area with nice looking store fronts plus new choices from the last time I was there.. . The real downside is that they don't have Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only in the common areas like the food court, lobby or pool. They also have a time limit of 48 hours for you to log-in if you stay at the hotel. Not good if you stay longer. Otherwise great hotel to stay in and wouldn't mind coming again in the future.
Deutlich besser als sein Ruf! . Das Luxor hat keinen besonders guten Ruf, nach den aufwendigen Renovierungsarbeiten sollte sich dies aber andern. Tolle Auswahl an Shows, groe Poollandschaftzund gutes Preisniveau. Lage ist auch ok, wenn auch nicht perfekt da man eher am Ende des Strips ist. Freundliches Personal und weniger als 10min vom Flughafen entfernt.
Location location location. You can walk to many if the near by casinos- several without even going outside!! We always stay in the pyramid rooms which are very nice with super soft beds. Check in is a pain in the ass though. Check out is east with several different options. The pool is nice abs relaxing but nothing to write home about. No lazy river or anything. Lots of good places to eat abs the coupon book is awesome. Chris angel show is NOT good but jabawakees is AWESOME.
We just got home from our relaxing Vegas Trip and stayed at Luxor and loved it. We always stay at this hotel and have never had any problems.There was no lines to check in and we were there at 7:30 pm on a Friday evening and check out was just as easy. The room was clean and the beds were really comfortable. We went to the pool and paid $70 for 2 padded chairs with umbrella and were in the private pool which was awesome. Anyone who rents a cabana, or padded chairs gets the use of the private pool, which is not crowded at all and the best part there were no kids in there. There are kids allowed but most people are not going to bring there kids in because you have to pay. So by paying you get a relaxing day. I see all these negative reviews and I really think people just love to complain about anything. So I would definitely recommend this hotel. We already booked for the Labor Day weekend
Nickel meet the dime.. Because the two work together in here..Just for starters not related to property the fare should be 13 not 25 if the drivers use rip off  freeway.Tell them go on paradise blvd.Rip off alert. One early check in fee 20why? Two pool charge for this subpar pool..divided apart.The pool offernothing to justify that.Three 25 resort fee. No wifi.. No free newspaper. Spa use 15 a day ..Place is the biggest waste of concrete with use less artifact wannabes,Room in the tomb section pyramid.Ride to the room takes so long limited access.Other choices consider them cause this place was left behind? Updated argued with staff over the rip off resort fee  charged for it.Consider other properties.The place is like we charged you such a low rate your going to get nickel  and dimed.  But they charge according to demand and demand is lows..All time low is dividing a dirty pool and charging for a part. You leave feeling ripped off, but dispute the early check in fee and the get nothing resort fee.And after you check in check the room for dirt and filth over all the cast darkness..
My boyfriend and I recently ventured to Las Vegas for an entire week and stayed at the Luxor for the entirety of the trip. Unfortunately, the stay was disappointing. We were initially in awe over the enormity of the place. It looked really impressive, both from the outside and inside. . . When I first booked our hotel through Expedia, I requested a room with a nice view. Shouldn't be too tough, right? Mountains, sunrise, sunsets, the pool, the strip... there's a lot to choose from, and really, we aren't picky people. So, we get up to the counter to officially check-in, and I got specific - I requested a room viewing the west, so we could see some nice sunsets. Or at the essence of one, at least. With no words uttered, the woman gave us our room information, keys and a little coupon book, and we trekked through the casino, toward the elevators, and headed to our room. Well, we ended up having an unfortunate view of some air conditioning units, and ductwork. Joy. The rest of the stay was just rough. There was a Wheelof Fortune slot machine outside our room that we could hear clear as day through our door (even three floors up), which was unnervingly annoying. Why the choice was made to put one random machine in the middle of a mostly empty hallway, I'll never truly know. Using up the real estate, I guess. I've also read multiple reviews regarding customers getting free upgrades to Suites and such, and we had no such luck... even after staying there for a whole WEEK. No compensation of anything, no in-room wifi (weak), no coffee pot in room (I could kill a man for some hot tea in the morning), and a ridiculous resort fee of $22.40 per day for extras we never used like the fitness room, incoming faxes (gee thanks, 1993), daily newspaper, etc. I was also a little disappointed with what the actual room provided for us. Usually, when staying at a hotel, they provide you with a book or handout that includes important numbers, hours, directions, room service menus, or channels. I mean, I've gone to places where this thing is a literal novel. Our room had nothing. I'm sure our hotel offered room service, but apparently, I'll never know.. . The pool was refreshing though (even if the "free" portion of the pool was only 3  1/2 feet deep... not really used for swimming, but rather wading around). Still lovely on the hot days though. And the drinks served at the pool were awesome, albeit expensive. The beds and pillows were also nice, and housekeeping seemed to be on point (we always saw them busily working from room to room).. . When I go on vacation, I like to feel like I'm really getting away and my hotel room is part of the experience. On a day-to-day basis, I'm usually totally focused on keeping my own house clean, organized, and comfortable... it's nice not to worry about it for a little bit. So, when I feel like I'm getting nickel and dimed, or like I'm just one random customer in a sea of others willing to pay "better" money, it's disappointing. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back...
It's getting dated quickly. The decor is reminiscent of 1993, the year the hotel was built. No wifi in the rooms but there is a cat 5 connection.. The pool is amazing but make sure not to take a picture of the staff, (grace) or you may find security asking you to delete the picture. C'mon, it's a pool , semi-naked bodies all over and a staff member doesn't want to be photographed?. Overall it's not a bad deal for the money, but there are newer hotels on the strip. Slots were tight, boobs were amazing. We might try it again .
The pyramid in the middle of the strip was pretty cool. Cool architecture and statues. I liked the Score sports exhibit inside...and I met a bass player for some metal band and took pics with him lol fun times!
my family & I  travel a lot to Vegas and this is our #1 hotel.Lets start of by food,they have a variety of food in their good court but I've tasted the McDonalds and it tastes awesome so does Starbucks!The rooms are okay to me,the bed is comfy they have a nice quality TV what more to ask for?It's at the end but you can walk to Excalibur then New York New York and start things off there!The parking lot is old but at least it's not dark.Elevators are good just the one on the parking lot is creepy.I love the Egyptian designs!The service is fast and nice! I love the Fact it has attractions inside.The pools are nice just the fact the pool that is cooler gets to be VIP like last time I went it was for everyone!It's also connected to the Mandalay Bay stores!I love this hotel and Recommended it !!
We stayed here for five days while visiting family in town.. . I have no complaints at all, it was a great stay!. . I did book online at hotels.com, and that was cheaper than the front desk price, but I assume everyone can find a price they are comfortable with one way or another.. . We got a room with two queen beds, on the 28th floor of the main pyramid. The room was super spacious, which is always nice. The bathroom had a nice big shower, but no tub. I'm not sure if other rooms have tubs or all of them only have showers.. . The wi-fi is free with the resort fee, but only in public areas, not your room...I guess I do have one complaint, but it didn't cause any issues, just not convenient.. . All the staff we interacted with was friendly and helpful.. . I would definitely stay here again!
Place needs to be renovated. Badly. . . don't get a room facing the pool, you'll cook if you have to go back to your room in the afternoon for any reason.. . No wifi... WTF?. . Maids left a cleaning brush and used wash cloth in the room after one visit.. . I will NOT be staying here again. Now i know why it was dirt cheap.
We won't be back.. . The bass from the nightclub passes right through the rooms in that partof the structure at sufficient volume to prevent sleeping.. . We are 8 floors up and I may as well try curling up to sleep on the dance floor.. . The room was only slightly cheaper than Venetian and Bellagio. Shame on me for trying to save a buck.. . Predictably there were no other rooms to move us to until the next day, and the receptionist made it sound like a very familiar problem. They probably get many complaints a night about this.. . I feel its a shady business that would attempt to pass off such uninhabitable accommodations for 300 bucks a night including the taxes and fees. And no wifi, nor the bed type you booked.. . Caveat emptor.
I dont know why i see bad reviews on here especialy when it comes to paying fees up front. That never happened to me and i made my reservations on line. I was able to get a Pyramid Suite with a 4 person tub next to the slanted window and a seperate living room for $92 a night. Add the fees and stuff it is more expensive. But every hotel has those fees. . . Our check in was at 10am.....WOW i paid an extra $20 for that and it was sooooooo worth it. I hate checking in at 3pm at other hotels. . . Our room was big and over exceeded my expectations. I had the time of my life this week and had so much fun. . . Except for the EDC people everything was perfect.. . Thank you LUXOR. Cant wait to go back.. . Zeke
Would not stay here again. NO coffee maker in room! Had to walk about half a mile in the morning, in my slippers, to get coffee. Called the desk to ask for a coffee maker; wouldn't give me one. . . Prepare to pay double the pricesfor a cup of coffee at the Starbucks. No refrigerators in the rooms either. You can do a lot better in Vegas I'm sure.. . No free wifi in room either! In other words, this hotel is about 10 years behind every other hotel.
Pretty horrible stay a couple months ago at the Luxor. We were put in a first floor room right next to the elevators, which was bad enough, but then at like 4am that night a huge fight breaks out at the elevators / in front of our room that results in security being called. . . I complained at checkout and they were nice enough to email me an offer me a stay in an upgraded room for my next trip to Vegas to make it up to me. However, a couple months later, when I tried to claim the offer, no one replies to any of my emails. What a horrible place. Avoid.
Heading to the Luxor this weekend and have stayed there several times in the past.  Coming from the hospitality business myself I'm very aware of how powerful Yelp can be for a business.  Most of these negative reviews are coming from unreal expectations, it's common sense that older hotels will have more wear and tear and not offer state of the art amenities.  . . A 1 star review for no coffee maker??  Come on people, grow up and stop being such pussies.   Then go downstairs to Starbucks, they make a better cup than you do anyway.. . Are there nicer options out there for hotels?  Absolutely but not at this price.  You're not staying at the Luxor for luxurious spotless rooms, you're staying there because it's on the strip and cheap.  It probably needs a renovation but once that happens, people will probably complain about the "new, higher prices".     Sometimes even when you win, you lose...
Stayed here during EDC weekend. Pros were it's cheap and right on the strip. However, my room didn't have a microwave or a mini fridge. The AC I have at home was better than the one in the room and guest services were really slow. THERE IS NO WIFI IN GUEST ROOMS. You have to go down to the main floor for that which is absolutely ridiculous. They gave my friend an ethernet cable in his room. Cell service really sucks too. They have an ok gym though and a big outdoor pool. You can get to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay easily through the walkway.
The room was not cleaned - the bathroom was filthy and the floor was not vacuumed. Found an eyelash and several sequins on the floor. There was also hair in shower and bed. The toilet was not scrubbed. Had to ask for housekeeping to come twice and finally the third time housekeeping came. Even after housekeeping attempted to clean the room, the shower still had the hair in it.. . Good thing I brought my own Lysol travel spray to sanitize the shower, toilet, fixtures, TV remote and the bed. We tried to get another room but guest services said they where over booked.. . They have no WiFi services nor coffee pots in the room, which I found out that coffee pots are reserved for the suites. Definitely will not ever again conduct any kind of business with the Luxor.
My parents' touring agency booked us at the Luxor during our stay in Las Vegas for about two nights out of seven/eight days, and I am here at the hotel as I type...  I'm impressed of the decor, and I am pretty sure most of these statues and paintings are replicas of the real artifacts....but I digress.  It is still a very pretty place with its own charm.. . However, I'm a little disappointed that there is wifi only on the first few floors (Lower Level, Concourse), and no free coffee maker with packets of coffee most hotels tend to have nowadays.  Hence, minus a star, but I'm not going to make too much of a big deal about it unless the service happens to be really bad...I mean come on, d'you expect every single hotel have a butt-washing toilet like one of the hotels I stayed in when I was in Waikiki?  Of course not.  Not every establishment can afford that.. . And the other reasons why I rated it this way as well....it is mighty convenient to have trams to connect  to Mandala Bay and then from there to the stop located in between the other side of Exacalibur and New York New York.  Save me and my parents' tired feet after sitting on the coach bus for nearly half the daylight hours, trekking through rocky passes in the Grand Canyon, and explored three casinos (Luxor, Excalibur, and NY NY).  A little round-about if you ask me, but it is still a time saver.  Would have been a perfect 5, if there were wifi amenities in my room.. . One little thing I forgot to mention....while the rooms were great, the bathroom design is a little...well...stifling.  Not as respiratory problem, but I meant energy.  Poor circulation of energy. But that's just my opinion.   Then again, some rooms might be a little different.
Stayed at The Luxor recently for a conference. I disagree with many of the negative comments. I stayed in a tower room and I thought it was very clean and up to date. The hallways were a little noisy in the night, but that is to be expected. . . Check in was really easy. I walked right up. I was a little early (1pm), but they were able to accommodate me right away.  . . All the meeting rooms that we used were excellent. The food and snacks that were provided were very good.
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #137 - #365. . Oh how I heart the Luxor, especially the powerful beam at night. Quarky Vegas still lives! It's south strip location isn't convenient towards the center strip, so you'd either have to walk a long distance or take a cab. The sphinx is one of the only marks on Luxor that keep it Egyptian other than the pyramid.. . Check In was quick and the clerk was very friendly. Our room was in the prymaid so we had to walk a long ways towards the corner of the prymaid to get to the inclinator (elevator). Walking to the room was fun just looking at what was left of the Egyptian theme and the inclinator was shakey! We were on the 23rd floor and had a view of the atrium. Breathtaking view of the atrium and where you can people watch 24/7. . . The room was just bland. More like a notch above Excalibur and on the same league as Ballys and the Flamingo. There was no wifi so I had to use my AT&T network but I heard they plan on adding WiFi soon. Welcome to the 2,000's!  . . Pool here is not luxurious and just as average as the hotel room. Food options are ok with the food court and average buffet with no wow factor. It's also connected internally to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. If you're too tired to walk, they have a monorail that connects to all three resorts. . . What I'll miss most about the Luxor is the spitting camels and the water ride. The positives are the Carrot Top, Bodies Exhibit, and the Titanic Exhibit.
I was looking forward to my stay at Luxor because I was entranced by the promise or diagonal wall windows in the pyramid and the pyramid shaped shampoo and soap people talked about.. . The window was cool, but there was no pyramid shaped soap.. . The room was clean, non-smoking, and two queen beds. Just what we asked for. One thing I didn't like though was that even though we didn't have the do not disturb sign on our door, the cleaning service never came by during our stay. We had to call and ask for new towels and cups, etc.. . But they promptly responded. . . The location of the hotel on the strip is just okay.. . I would stay again, but it's not my top choice.
Where to begin:. . Pool area would be nice but no shade and you are charged for every little thing out there.. . Rooms are a similar letdown.  No wifi, irons that don't work, bathrooms that look nice but are lacking maintenance, and AC units that run nonstop and still can't manage to get the room cold.. . Casino floor is small but otherwise ok, although certain areas actually have a raw sewage smell to them.. . Only bright spot is the staff who have been nothing but nice.
I gave the Luxor one star only because you couldn't give a negative star review. I called and asked if a early check-in was available. The lady said yes. When I arrived the lady at the front desk didn't even check her computer and said nothing was available. I told her I had just called and she then decided to take the time to check her computer. She charged me $20.00 for an early check-in and gave me a room on the 2nd floor. When I entered my room there was a dirty towel on the floor left behind from the previous guest. YUCK!. . Absolutely terrible! Rooms that  haven't been updated since the day the Hotel was built. The A/C did not work in the room so I called the front desk. They said they would come fix it, don't know if they every showed up, however my room never cooled down. When I checked out I had charges on my room that weren't mine (they did fix that).  Do your self a favor stay else where even if the room is comp'd. Thanks Luxor for a terrible stay!
There was nothing amazing about this hotel. Food court was pricey, rooms were average, and the pool water was freezing! I personally would not stay here again. However I did like how they held our bags before our check in time. They also give you a little booklet with coupons for the shows and such they have in the hotel, but wasn't much of a discount.
I haven't stayed on this end of the strip yet, so it was fun to see what this hotel had to offer. Though I was only there for a max of two nights, I did get a chance to walk around to check out this hotel. . . Casino-wise, I'm really not very helpful with because I'm not a big gambler, so I couldn't tell you if it was "good" or not. It seemed pretty typical to me. I liked there were a lotof options of things to do here (Criss Angel, Bodies, Titanic and Jabbawockeez are all in this location) and that there's a food court upstairs for some quick, cheap eats if you wanted. Other than that though, nothing really stood out to me at this hotel.. . Same applies for the rooms. I thought they were okay, but at the same time, it is Vegas, so most time spent is out of the room, right?! :) If I was at this end of the strip, I may stay here again, but I'd probably want to check out other locations before staying here again.
Review based on an overall experience.  I have stayed in a Tower Deluxe Room in the East Tower, a Suite in the East Tower, and a Pyramid Deluxe Room.. . Last year I was playing Blackjack for 4 hours at Luxor and since then I have been getting free rooms, basically at my disposal.  The perks of being a Gold Member with MLife.. . The rooms at Luxor are average size sat around 450 sq. feet. They come with all the basic necessities: somewhat comfy bed, iron, safe, bath amenities, tv.  There is nothing great about these rooms, but at the same time there is nothing bad.  The bathrooms are bigger than the ones at The Mirage and have a separate tub/shower.  This is one thing that makes these rooms better.  But what MGM and The Mirage lack in the bathroom department, they make up for in swankiness.  Luxor's rooms are blah. The decor is old, the carpet is blue and the overall feeling you get when you walk in is.... When are they going to renovate?. . Oh, and there is no W-Fi inside their rooms.  Ethernet cords are available. (Pssssst, wanna know a little secret?  There is Wi-Fi.... Only in select rooms in the West Tower. They are currently testing out their Wi-Fi). . Their pool area is pretty basic.  A couple of small pools and cabanas that are basically tarps protecting youfrom the sun. Please don't waste your money.  Nobody at the Luxor pool cares that you have a cabana.  The restaurant choices at Luxor are pretty slim. Their Mexican restaurant "Tacos + Tequila" and Asian restaurant "Rice & Company" is way overpriced.  There is a food court that has the usual places... Pizza, chicken fingers, burgers. Nothing special.  A few Starbucks are scattered within the property. . . There are a few shows at Luxor, Jabbawockeez and Carrot Top. I wouldn't waste your time and money on Jabbawockeez.  I was a fan of theirs on America's Best Dance Crew, but apparently they are only entertaining performing in 3 minute segments on TV. Watching them for 1.5 hours was a little too much of the same thing over and over again.  Carrot Top on the other hand is hilarious.  I saw him years ago at MGM but I'm sure he's just as funny at Luxor.  I would definitely recommend Carrot Top to those who are familiar with pop culture though.. . Overall, I don't think I would go out of my way to stay at Luxor.  Having the room be free is a nice perk, but I would prefer to stay at Monte Carlo as it's more centrally located and the rooms are a little more updated and modern. . . If you're able to get a good deal ($50 or under), don't mind walking to where all the action is, and are too drunk to care about what your room entails, then by all means, get your LUX on.
