If you pay for a strip-view room, look before you settle in.  I settled in and didn't look out the window until the next morning to see an alleyway and parking lots.  Our room was facing The Mirage was our main view with W Reno Ave outside the window.  They have a new owner that is tightening up budgets.  The Employees will tell you all about loosing out (except for the unions).  Customers are paying for the bottom line too!  Don't let Him take advantage of you like he did me.  I will Avoid for the price I paid.
This was a great place to stay!  We found a hotwire deal for this place for about half of the usual cost.  I honestly have no complaints, other than a somewhat bland buffet, but even still, we had a 2 for 1 which the front desk gave us.  No big deal.. . Free parking (if you're from LA you'll understand how nice it is to park your car and not have to pay!); check in took 5 mins; nicely themed casino.  Was much nicer than I thought it would be.. . The beds are SUPER COMFORTABLE!  I can't remember the last time I had such a good night's sleep.  The rooms are super nice and modern.  Nice shower with an oversized tub.. . It's not the newest or flashiest hotel on the strip, and as long as you don't expect Bellagio levels of luxury you will not be disappointed. . . The one thing that I'd like to note here (and another thing I loved about this place), is that it's not ridiculously crowded like most of the other casinos.  Because there is no mall, etc. attached to it it is not nearly as insanely crowded as other properties.  This I loved.  It is certainly busy, but you aren't "over it" in 2 hours.  Walking around Caesars, The Venetian, Cosmopolitan (admittedly nicer hotels) I got tired of quickly because there are always people in your face.. . Would definitely stay here again!. . One bummer:  The pirate show has been permanently discontinued :(.
Stayed here May 17-19 for my 21st Bday with my boyfriend. The lobby is beautiful, I looooooooved this hotel. We checked in and they gave us a complimetary bottle of champagne since it was my birthday, which was so nice of them. They treated us like gold. The room was really nice and clean. We have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. We ate at this restaurant that was in our hotel, which served the best pho ever! Had a great experience in Vegas. I wouldnt have spent it at any other hotel.. Will definately stay here in the future :)
Great location, reasonable rates, and the room is clean and decent makes TI an option for next stay in Vegas.. . First of all TI is walking distance Wynn, Venetian, Mirage, Caesar's and other major properties.  Unfortunately, you will probably go there for gaming because TI offering is not that great.  Same for food (see reviews of buffet).. . Rooms are ok, nothing fancy.  Small TV and the toiletries are good quality.  Resort fee is steep at $25 per night.  Fitness room offer free bottled water and fruits. The room includes mini refrigerator and safe.
Summary: Was really happy with the hotel. Stayed for one night in a room with two queen beds-- the room was clean, well maintained and spacious enough for the three of us staying there. It had a bucket for ice, a nice bathroom, a safe, a mini fridge (hidden in the closet), ironing board and iron, nice flat screen tv, and a bunch of space if you need to unpack your luggage in drawers. We had a room which looked towards the lonely Trump Hotel up north. Other than that, the hotel staff were friendly enough, the casino was pretty standard with all the usual gambling tables and slots, though we didn't really gamble much there. . . Location: The hotel is located at the northern end of the action on the strip, across the street from the Venetian and the Palazzo, and down the road from the Mirage and Caesars Palace. I personally wouldn't book a hotel any further north than this (ie Circus Circus or Trump) if you are planning on walking around throughout the course of your stay, or else you'll be taking a long long walk to get to the fun.  . . Downsides: It is a bit of a trek walking from the self serve parking lot to check-in, so best to have wheelie luggage. We visited the pool which was okay, they seemed to close a lot earlier than people had hoped, as everyone was disappointed when they were told they had to get out. Also, apparently they no longer have the pirate show out front, didn't really care to inquire further, but it would have been cool to check that out.   . . Price: We booked about a week and a half in advance and got a room for around $110 for a Saturday night through orbitz, with a coupon code. I've also heard that trying the $20 cash trick when you check in will get you an upgraded room, but as we weren't planning on spending that much time in the room so thought we might as well spend our money elsewhere. You also have to pay a service fee at the hotel, which covers internet, and random other amenities that no one cares about, which is $25. They do gladly offer late check out, if you are too groggy to get out on time, but it will cost you $40 extra.

My boyfriend and I just spent the last four days at Treasure Island. The room was nice and updated. I was a bit concerned we wouldn't have a roll-in shower, since they won't guarantee any of their rooms. We did get a roll-in shower, but they gave away the king room so we got a room with two queens.. The view was spectacular, but with the view came the noise of the party pool. Which club music was blasted from 12pm- until the pool closed. Which was unfortunate when we wanted to relax by the pool, but couldn't because the music was so loud I started to get a headache just stepping out into the pool area. . The hotel has ended their pirate battle and has gotten rid of almost all if their pirate theme. Almost all of the hotels have gotten rid of their themes.. Overall the stay was fun, but it's very different from the Vegas I remember.
We've stayed at a few hotels on the strip and I have no complaints about TI. We stayed in in a standard room with King bed.  The room itself was spacious and clean. The bed and bedding were clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was large with and nice shower and huge mirror (plus a magnifying mirror to do your makeup in!) There was a mini fridge in the closet, a huge plus if you're storing leftovers or keeping drinks cool.  The hallways were clean and quiet. We didn't have any issues with noise. Temperature was well controlled. We had a view of the strip and the pool.. . The pool at TI is nice, shallow, meant more for schmoozing than swimming. There was a DJ there that afternoon, playing top 40 junk I didn't recognize, and all the frat boys and girls were partying it up like 1999. Had plenty of lounge chairs for catching some rays (responsibly, with lots of sunscreen of course).. . Overall, a pleasant stay; check-in and check-out were painless. The only gripe I had was their Siren Show that happens at night in front of the hotel. It's been drained and cancelled indefinitely. That was one of the reasons I'd been excited to stay at TI. Bummer.
Room is quite small. Dimming lightning even with all the lights on, Interior design is kinda odd. Low ceiling made the room seen smaller. Flooring in the toilet is cracked. Wifi is including with the mandatory resort fee, claimed to be "high-speed" but when in room it's rather slow compared to my 4G LTE. Asked for a couple wine glasses and extra towels got CHARGED for $5.41 for in-room service. Please note rollaway bed is extra $30+tax fee. Out first time here and will be the last
The pirates show is gone forever :/ found that out after staring at the ships for awhile and then asking someone lol . This is an older casino without much pizzazz :/
I was really surprised how nice the room and bathroom was. The front desk attendant was very sweet and accommodating. I will for sure come back.
We saw a Groupon for TI and decided to skip the groupon and to just pay for the room. There's a reason it's so cheap. We got in, and it all seemed okay...until we went to go to bed. As soon as we turn the covers down, there's blood all over the sheets. This was at about 11:45pm. My husband calls down to the desk and, very nicely, asks if someone can come up and change our sheets because we'd like to go to bed and there is blood on them. Instead of them just saying yes, they ask him a million questions first. So they finally send someone from housekeeping up... Over an HOUR later. She knocks on the door at 1am, and while she is changing the sheets her walkie-talkie is on very loud and they were screaming and talking obnoxiously over it. Thankfully she turned it down after a few minutes. After that, I was very uneasy about sleeping in the bed. Bottom line: there are plenty other hotels to stay at, I wouldn't recommend this one.
We've stayed at a few hotels on the strip and I have no complaints about TI. We booked 2 rooms with pool view.  The room itself was clean and roomy. The bed and bedding were clean and super comfy. The bathroom was large with and nice shower and huge mirror (plus a magnifying mirror to do your makeup in!) There was a mini fridge in the closet.  The hallways were quiet. We didn't have any issues with noise. Loved the fact that I did not HEAR the air conditioner like other rooms I have stayed in.  The only complaint was I did NOT get a pool view - instead it was a roof top view :(. . The buffet for dinner was WAY pricey and I can see why they give you a 2 for 1 coupon.. . Would recommend to friends and family.
We had our wedding at TI. I'll review the wedding chapel and salon separately. We booked our reservation through one of their reservation agents and chose to stay their because their wedding packages were affordable. We booked a NON SMOKING Tower Suite and the two adjoining rooms next to it. I reconfirmed a few days prior to our arrival. The weekend we were there was the EDC music festival (Google "Electric Daisy Carnival" and you'll understand what we had to deal with). We were prepared that it would be nuts in Vegas. As a "courtesy" they opened up check in at 1pm instead of 3pm only to find out later they CHARGED us $25 for "early check in" (we called after we got home and had it removed). At check in "Evelyn" informed us that we had smoking rooms. We told her that we needed nonsmoking. She said, "That is a request not a guarantee".  We tried to explain to her that we were having our wedding there and that we were told by the reservation agent that we would get nonsmoking for all three rooms. Evelyn offered to waive one day of the resort fee ($25) for the inconvenience of having a smoking room (we stayed 5 days).  We went round and round with her for 20 minutes and her response was the same: "That is a request not a guarantee". At this point I said, "I'm getting married here. I chose YOUR hotel to have my wedding and we haveguests traveling to stay in those rooms." Her response: "We have over 1600 people here this weekend." During this entire exchange my husband and I remained calm and courteous despite our anger and frustration at the situation. We did not yell, swear or disparage Evelyn.  My husband asked for a manager and she said, "I'll get her but she's with another guest so you will have to step aside and wait for her." As my husband was speaking to her and calmly expressing our frustration Evelyn was running her tongue along her front teeth, looking at her computer monitor and messing with her hair. My husband knew that she had crossed a line with me and knew I was about to lose it, so he sent me out into the lobby to calm down.  Later, my husband tells me that while waiting for the manager she told him that "only my manager can make these changes." If that were the case, why did she not offer the manager in the first place? When the manager finally comes over, she was courteous, professional  and had been working on resolving our situation. Evelyn never told us that the manager not only knew what we were complaining about but that she was actually working on resolving the situation. The entire check in process took 45 minutes. I'm only giving TI a "3" because our introduction tainted our entire experience at TI and had it not been the fact that our wedding was there and the EDC festival had booked up Vegas, we would have left. We encountered two other awful employees: a snotty waitress in the Breeze bar and the rude man running the TI Bling shop (we had forgotten the cuff links and he tried to sell us a pair of $100 sterling silver ones. We went to Macy's instead and got a pair for $50). Since we had friends in for our wedding we tried to get tables in the different restaurants for all of us to be together. Kahunaville, the Breeze Bar, and Gilley's BBQ each asked for a credit card for the entire group if it was over 8. That was a very frustrating request. . . With all of that being said: Our Tower Suite was wonderful and large enough to have our reception in it (30 guests). We each had our own bathrooms large enough to get ready for the wedding in. Other than those encounters, the rest of the employees were pleasant, helpful and accommodating. . . It's unfortunate that some of our experiences were so extreme they did not outweigh the good experiences.  I probably will not stay here again. Considering the amount of money we spent in TI, there's a lot of other competition on the strip and we could have stayed across the street at the Venetian for the same amount of money we spent at TI.
Ok, where to start.  3 friends and I were in town for a festival and booked a room at Treasure Island hotel via booking.com.  On booking.com, we paid an $20 extra to have the option of selecting a king sized bed or a room with two queens.  We needed two queens because we had a total of four people.  I even specified in the comments section that we absolutely had to have a room with 2 queen beds.  .      We get there, only to find out that they've taken the liberty of booking us a single king bed despite our requests/reasoning for a double.  Elsi, a front desk rep, proceeded to tell us she would speak to a manager to see what she could do.  In comes the assistant desk manager from Hell, Nichollete Pelcher, riding in on her high horse, letting us know that she will "take care of us" and only charge us an extra $30 a day to upgrade to the two queen beds (even though we had all ready paid the up charge once through booking.com).  I was stuck, I couldn't do anything, I had to pay it or not have a hotel room.  The front desk experience with Elsi and Nichollete was about the worst customer service you can provide and will be the main reason why I'll never stay here again even if I was offered a free visit..      Some other general comments about the hotel.  The area near the front lobby smells like ten million cigarettes have been smoked there in the last week.  The air conditioning is constantly freezing in every common area of the hotel.  We had to have our room temp set on "Heat, Fan, Hi, and the temperature halfway up in order to get the room to 72 degrees.  The food selections are really bad.  You could pay half the price and have the same experience at one of the trashy strip hotels in Vegas.  Read the other reviews.  Yelp does not lie! Do not trust a business with only 3 stars.  I should've known better!
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #136 - #365. . Argh! . . I remember when Treasure Island opened back in 1993 with the free battle ship show between the British and the Pirates. Of course, the pirates always win at Treasure Island. . . Originally, Steve Wynn wanted to build a second tower to the Mirage. He later decided to make it a separate resort themed for kids to keep the Mirage kid free. The location is in a prime area next to the fashion show mall and walking distance to 5 star hotels like; Wynn, Encore, Venetian, and Palazzo. Room rates won't break the bank but you do get what you pay for. Rooms here are just average and not luxurious as the Mirage. More like a step down.. . Pool here is oh so small! It's about the size of Ballys for this size of resort and it can get overcrowded, making it hard to find a pool lounger. The casino here is very active and they still have the pirate theme in the casino. That's what makes Vegas unique. . . They've made some changes over the years like:. . -Sirens show and removing it for a a shopping center. -Expanding Senior Frogs. - Changing the Treasure Island Marquee to something with less character and more blandness. -Remodeled hotel rooms. -Removing Mutiny Bay (Arcade) for Kahullaville. -Removing the pirate throughout the casino / hotel
I got his hotel when I booked through Hotwire. Check in was super easy and I wasn't required to pay the hotel fee which was super awesome! The room was nice. Not the biggest but it fit 3 people pretty comfortably. My only complaint and only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because it smelled like someone took a huge dump in the bathroom before we got in there. Maybe it was housekeeping. I mean if you gotta go you gotta go I guess right?
Nice hotel with a great location. It's not the fanciest hotel, but that rooms are nice. The hotel is located on the strip and within walking distance to a lot (like the mall). You have to show your room key to get into the elevator bank after a certain point in the night, so keep it on hand. We could see the pool from out room and it look ok, but not too exciting to re opted for a pool party elsewhere. . . We had dinner at Gilley's and the food was pretty good. The manager came by and talked to us for a while. We also tried the breakfast buffet and they have quite a selection.  . . The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful.
Alright, so everyone wants to go to Vegas and stay in the modern, beautiful expensive hotels, i.e., Cosmo,  Planet Hollywood, Aria, etc., but don't get too caught up in the excitement of it all because Treasure Island is still pretty nice and about a third of the price. . . It has a great location (right in the middle of the strip with restaurants, stores and hotels everywhere), pretty good rooms (genuinely the most heavenly comforter I've ever slept under) and good prices. . . We stayed in a room with a strip view, which, as we found out,  is both a curse and a blessing. Yes, we saw the amazing night lights and had fun watching the crazies stumbling around with their foot long Fat Tuesdays. But, we also heard the "Sirens of TI", their (oddly seductive for an initially kid friendly hotel) pirate show outside the hotel...every night...multiple times... Had it stuck in our heads the whole trip--not the worst thing but also not the greatest. . . The hotel itself is kinda meh--go somewhere else for dinner, but the as far as accommodations it's a solid choice for a Vegas trip that won't break the bank.
I've stayed here a few times and gambled here quite often. The rooms are very clean and modern. They do need to work on their check in though on busy weekends. It can take forever to weave through the lines to get your room.. . The restaurant options in this place are sort of pricey. You can't really get a meal for less than $20 here. My suggestion is to head over to the Mirage on the free tram as their options are a little less, but not by a whole bunch.
