I had a hankering for pasta and Lavo hit the spot. After parking in the Palazzo and trekking it to the Venetian, did I realize the Lavo is in the Palazzo.  My suggestion is park in the Palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into Lavo. They do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nights. . . After three weeks of low carbing, pasta was the only thing on my mind. With a plethora of Italian restaurants off the strip, out of all the reviews, Lavo seemed to fit.  I chose to sit out on the patio, despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93F outside. With EDM playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip, it gives Lavo a very trendy feel.  . . They start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm. Paired with a red dipping sauce, it melted in my mouth. What was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once I began to devour the little bites of heaven. . . On to the entree.Spaghetti carbonara had my name or should I say my stomach written all over it.  The plate looks deceptively small but once you dig in to the mound of pasta, you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion. The spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint. It was rich in flavor and solid meal all around. It's not the best I have had but considering the location and the ambiance, Lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.  . . I finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but wow, what a surprise. It wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste. I had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose. . . If you are looking for a trendy Italian Las Vegas hot spot, Lavo will not disappoint.
Beautiful trendy place, ambiance is great for a dinner before going out in Vegas. Food was good as well.
Zero.  I have eaten here before and the food was pretty good, but here's my story.  My wife and I were looking for somewhere to eat.  We walked in about 4:45, when they opened at five.  I told them we would be right back at five and wanted a table for 2.   Since I couldn't wait in the bar for 15 minutes, I told them that I was going to walk around the corner, grab two wines and be back at 5:00.  . . My wife and I got some over-priced glasses of wine ($40) in the Casino bar and walked back at 5:00.  The male manager stood there and gave me this look of disdain and in a snotty tone said "You can't bring in any outside drinks.  You'll havethe pour them out."   . . I just started laughing at him.  Really?  Are you the effing TSA?  Pour out $40...for you?  You just saw me 15 minutes ago, it's not like I am sneaking in with a case of beer.  What if I brought in my own expensive wine bottle?  Do you not have a corking fee?   . . NEVER again will I walk through these doors.  They lost a $400+ bill.  We hopped in a cab and went to Olives at Bellagio and dropped $450.  Patron - 1.  Lavo- 0.  . . Crappy service, begets a crappy response and something posted forever on the internet.
If you're looking for traditional Italian comfort food then this isn't the place. If you're into loud music and nice decor with okay food then you're looking in the right spot. A lot of the menu is seafood based and leaves little options if you're not into that. My wife had Spaghetti Carbonara which was not bad, but wasn't anything to write home to Ma and tell her I found a replacement for her Rigatoni Carbonara. I had the Cavatelli at the suggestion of the server (after discussing not having a Pesto based pasta) and it was less than impressive. I think I could have had spaghetti and meat balls and been more pleased. Both entrees were heavy on the salt, with the Cavatelli being so much that I could barely finish it. The table was uncomfortable to sit at. The base is so large that when you pull your chair up to it your legs have to sit outside the edges of the table itself. In all, it was okay, but for a $70 meal for two, I would have expected more. I guess we have been ruined by so many great menu choices from The Hill.
Firstly,the place is great. Very sexy and a cool patio. Plenty of seats to lounge at in a large group. The food and the drinks were tasty, but the SERVICE...where do I begin...The place wasn't very busy when we arrived at 9 on a weeknight. The bartender was rude and acted like we were bothering him. We sat outside in the patio and it took FOREVER for the Asian server girl to greet or offer her serverness. She was rude and standoffish. I made a comment to another server about getting the manager and she quickly changed her tune, but the damage was done. The Treasure Island show can cancelled due to wind advisory so that was a bummer too. We went to the lounge around 10 and it was drab and lifeless. I realize it was early in the night for Vegas, but the Trance music was meh. The bartenders up there though,  we're a 180 from the ones downstairs- nice, approachable, talkative, respectful, attentive... But the vibe for the place just wasn't there for me that night. I will likely not go back unless there's someone majorly cool as a guest.
Went here last Wednesday.   I ordered what I was told a popular items: Kobe meatball with ricotta.  I also age chicken parmesan with a dice of Pene pasta.  For desert their oreo malt.  I spit all of this with a friend.  Thr meatball was so salty we both could not eat it.  The server could have cared less when he asked why we did not eat it.  The chicken was bland and basic.  Finally the malt.  My fault here because I guess I did not read the menu clearly because was mini size with a plate of deep fried Oreos.  I thought it was just a oreo malt. . . All in all I will never go back.  Too many othet choices in vegas with much better food.
Delicious Lobster Louie Salad. Dinner comes with delicious garlic bread. Waiters and Waitresses are friendly and have great customer service. Elegant place to have a nice Italian dinner. Kumil Kandahari
Terrible service and they can't efficiently handle a party of 11.  . We had reservations for 7:30pm on a night that we needed to leave by 8:30pm to make a show.  We told out waitress this and she said no problem.  My wife ordered a soda from the waitress and it never came.  They put us at the end of the table, right where the walkway for the wait staff was.  Two out of three of them bumped into my chair each and every time they went past.  I scooted in as far as I could go.. . The menu is al a cart, so get ready for Vegas food price gouging!  . . At 8:32pm, our food still had not shown, so we left.  Went to the show and had pretzels and beer.  When we left we went back to the Ventian, but not to LAVO.  Not EVER!. . Had a good late night meal at Grand LUX Cafe.  Good food there!
Honestly expected more.  The food was mediocre at best and WAY overpriced.   First time ever that I've paid for extra bread.  Service was ok.  Nice atmosphere.  Chef wouldn't add spices I requested.  Blandest tuna steak I've  ever eaten.  I make it better myself. Add $40-$50 for water and bread.
We had a great time dining here. We set a reservation and decided to sit outside.. . Their garlic bread wrapped in foil was amazing! It also came with a red dipping sauce that went well with the bread.. . We ordered the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass - amazing and perfectly cooked, not too crispy on the outside and melted right in the center. It came with heirloom tomatoes and crispy portabella mushrooms. My wife ordered the Center Cut Filet - medium. Cooked well and had good flavor. We also had a side of the Thumbelina Carrots, which were enough for two - good flavor with the gorgonzola and shaved beets.. . Our server did a good job and it was a great dining experience overall.
Decided on LAVO since it was probably the closest place to eat in our hotel. So glad we did! We got sat right away, were greeted by our server ( who btw not only was awesome but very handsome) . They are also dressed very nice with suspenders. The coffee there was great. And i' m super picky as I drink coffee everywhere I go. Brunch was also awesome, they served us different breads-pastries while we waited for our meal which was delicious to say the least. Everyone there was super nice and even stopped to converse with us. I would definitely go back again. 5 stars on my list.
