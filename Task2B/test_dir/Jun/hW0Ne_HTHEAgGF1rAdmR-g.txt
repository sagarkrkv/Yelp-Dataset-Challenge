This airport is always easy to navigate through. Lots off good restaurants to choose from. Very efficient & well maintained!
Great house burger! Server - Jennifer- was Awesome!! . A little pricey for AZ. Also, I didn't appreciate the F-Bombs coming from the kitchen area as it got closer to 8pm and they were cleaning up.
Love this airport.  Even at night, it's busy, don't be fooled.  Also dress for it, at 11PM it's 99 degrees still. Terminal 4 isn't busy, but the others will be due to red eyes east.. . If you need a ride, no family or friends will come out, find the people in blue at Super Shuttle.  Awesome and reasonable! . . Welcome to PHX!
This is based on service/TSA.  Stupidest employees ever!  We asked information if there was a starbucks by gates A and she said yes and there is none. Glad they have an information desk.  . . They have a line allocator at the security check who puts everyone in one line and leaves 3 other lines with nobody in them.  Then they opened a new xray machine. Awesome right?  No!  They opened the new xray machine in a line with nobody waiting in it and that the long line cant get to. So the scanner was just sitting waiting for anyone to come by.. . I hate this airport!
Having been stuck here many times, once with a baby for 5 hours I can say it's not a bad airport to be stuck in!
Love this airport, very clean and fast security lines. Make sure to check out Blanco for your pre-flight beverage.
This is my favorite airport.  Perhaps I am biased and maybe my familiarity lends to the fact that I think it is easily navigated.  Each area is clearly marked with clear directions to each area.  The fact that it has free wifi is also a major reason I like it so much.
This is a pretty large airport. The SkyTram is awesome and very convenient. It connects to the Phoenix light rail, which makes it easy to get to Downtown. It is more than just a typical tram. It is great for viewing the airport and fun to ride. . . There's a ton of different dining options. It is very likely that you will find whatever you are craving here. There are plenty of signs to navigate you around. Overall, it is a fairly easy airport to get in and out of.
I flew from Reno to Las Vegas via US Airways and had layovers in Phoenix for nearly two and a half hours both times. I remained in the same terminal I landed in, and I got a lot of walking in to see what was around me. I didn't take the tram or anything. There are a lot of dining options like people say on Yelp. Also, I got to meet some people on my flight from Phoenix back to Reno, so the slogan about a friendly airport is true.. . The only inconvenience that I see is that if you are going from US Airways to Southwest in the same terminal, there is only one pedestrian bridge going from US Airways gates A and B to Southwest's gates. The good news is that I saw electric carts with passenger benches that were giving people rides, so I would take advantage of that if your layover is very short.
My main gripes about this Airport are many fold:. . If you are renting a car after arrival, you need to catch a bus to get to the car rental area, 6 miles away.  Once you arrive there, you will be hit with an airport surcharge fee for car rentals at the airport, even though you had to get a bus to get 6 miles from the airport!  . . If you are renting a car to go to the Grand Canyon, you must drive completely through the city and suburbs, as the Grand Canyon is on the opposite side of the city, compared to the airport.  You'll have to make that drive twice, a second time to return the car -not a fun drive in the afternoon rush hour, with road signs directing you to the airport, not the car rental!. . If you are going on the light rail system to downtown Phoenix, you will also have to catch a bus to get to the nearest light rail system stop on the very edge of the airport, but not within walking distance.  Undoubtably the taxi companies vetoed any light rail stop in the center of the airport, so they won't lose business!. . If you are returning a car, and taking a taxi to downtown, you have to return the car to the car rental area, take a bus 6 miles to the airport, and then catch a taxi to downtown.  No taxis at the car rental area!   . . On the positive side, the airport is only about 7 miles and a $22 cab ride from downtown Phoenix.  . . I don't know why they have the word 'harbor' in the name of the airport, as the ocean and harbor is at least 400 miles away.  They should have named it Desert International Airport.   It is what it is!
The women checking boarding passes at terminal 4 on Wednesday morning was so RUDE!!!!! She did not smile or say hello when I approached her.  She just said "scan it" referring to my boarding pass on my phone. She grabed my id looked at it and handed it back then said "ok" dismissing me. Not a great way to start a trip! This is not the first bad experience I have had at this terminal so I am noticing a common theme, poor customer service.
i love this airport.  Was here for 3 hours waiting for a connecting flight few years ago.  They have shuttle service running throughout each terminals.  A lot of open space but many food and stores.  Also checkpoint was a breeze.
The international airport in Phoenix sucks balls! All of the employees are rude and don't care if you have a problem, as for U.S airways, they screw up you seating on purpose to try to get you to pay for better seating.
I use this airport 3-4 times a year, I'm happy with it. I always park in economy and use airport shuttle to get to my terminal. $9 a day is ok with me, it's easy to get in and out without too much fuss. There is a shuttle that circles both the long term parking for East and West Economy that will cycle around all the terminals; don't use these if you are at all in a hurry because you will find that the path they take, must be derived from some calculation from corporate offices and one of basic simplicity. Just yesterday we were picked up, and rather that drive to the parking lot next to the terminal, West economy where we were parked, they drove past the entrance to West economy parking and away towards the next terminal; since it was going to take 20 minutes to loop around to our stop or longer, we got off and walked to the car. So if your trip is over, hop on the tram, enjoy the A/C and relax until your at your row in parking. If I were alone I would have stayed put.. There are times when I have 9am flights that the security is consistently at it's slowest going to California, to the point where I'm at a panic. However, since I know that's about a 30% likely and I've never missed a flight it's a minor gripe  in an overall successful process. I always get to the airport an hour early, so take that in mind if you don't. There have been 2-3 times at TSA where we are all in a panic wondering if we can remain civil to the process any longer. I don't know how many times the TSA end of the line steward will yell out, to go to another terminal C TSA for NO waiting. Man, if those employees aren't busy then move them over here!. The post TSA food choices are OK, nothing that exciting;  Wendy's, Subway and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Since i'm usually taking morning flights I'll always grab something from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf as my post TSA survival treat. The airport and parking is always clean and the staff have always been very courteous and professional.
Pretty nice airport.  I like how the terminals are set up and all connected.  The area by my gate was really crowded and didn't seem to have enough seating, but everything else was good.  And I love the views of the desert mountains from the terminal.
Generally nice airport to fly in and out of. Only issues are the immense size of it, honestly from check in/checking bags to TSA and then on to your gate can take almost 20 minutes walking alone, and then you have to add TSA time. Sometimes they're rather efficient, but sometimes they only have one lane open for a huge line of people. Hit or miss with them. . . Apart from the walking and the TSA time, the airport is really nice. Very clean and well maintained, lots of amenities inside as well. Baggage claim is also a huge area, and, likely due to the sheer size of the airport, it takes a while for baggage compared to other airports.
Traffic wise, the absolute hardest airport to navigate. Good shops, good food stops, but don't get flipped when being dropped off or you'll miss your flight.
I hate this airport. In many, many ways. Parking is the devil...picking up people is awful..getting stuck in that never ending loop of hell that goes around and around the airport is awful...I dread having to come here. . . If you use it as a connection, it's fine...but getting dropped off or picked up is not.. . I was picking up a child- the father went in, a staff member gave me complimentary 30 min. parking for a lot...drove to the lot, got lost on the way...tried to get out and the pass was void. Has a massive line behind me trying to get out..had to jump out of my car to get an attendant who told me I was doing it wrong (I wasn't)...very embarrassing. She had to override the system.... . Went to a cell-phone lot where you can't leave your car..the flight was delayed and I really had to use the restroom-I asked security if I could leave my car and to please please not ticket me- he said he has no control over that! haha great. . . Finally went back to pick up my friend...had to push through three lanes or almost stand-still cars to get to the curb..all in a lifted truck. . . Awesome time!
This review is for making connections, as I've never used this airport as my arrival/departure point. But this airport is huge!! Do not book tight connections through here, unless you are positive that you are in the same concourse and that gates won't change (which you will never predict). Takes a good 15-20 minutes walking to get from one end to the other, which is usually not a problem, but again, don't make tight connections through here. . . I don't feel like PHX has too much of a personality. Busy and hectic, yes, but compared to other west coast airports like lets say San Diego or San Francisco, this one is very no-frills. Food options are there, but nothing that really stands out.
Free wifi, a decide layout, and smooth security lines.  Yup, there are a few positives worth highlighting at Sky Harbor.  They also had rental car locations organized fairly well with easy access shuttles to get you there.  On the flip side, I wasn't really impressed with the food offerings.  I'm not overly picky, but if the airport food isn't any better than the in flight food, then you might have a problem.  However, overall more pros than cons.
I love the shops, cafes, and layout of this airport. The gates aren't far from the baggage claim. The only kind of inconvient thing is that the car rental vendors are off site. You have to take a 10 minute shuttle ride to the rental car place. The airport feels shiny and new. The shuttle bus drivers are so helpful. They always help me lift my bags on and off the shuttle. You must try cartel coffee if you get the chance. It's a local coffee chain that has a location in the airport.
This airport is garbage on so many levels.  You can show up here 2 hours early and miss your flight.  Not just you, like your whole plane full.  It's a joke.  Seriously, many PHX folks drive to Tucson.  That's 5 star airport.
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge #157 - #365. . We had a layover at Phoenix Harbor Airport from Toronto, CA and just by looking at the city of Phoenix from the plane. I'm glad to not live in a desolate city. I'd pretty much rather live in Las Vegas where there's more to do.. . But anyways, the airport is about the same size as Ontario International in California. Needs a it of updates here and there and the carpet has an odd smell to it. Staff here are always on the move and greatly assist you to your next destination.
As a frequent traveler, I've had the pleasure of visiting dozens of airports. I'm a fan of this airport for the following:. . 1) Phoenix Sky Harbor is easy to navigate, but be prepared to walk if you have a transfer or have to go to a different lettered gate. (A,B,C,D). 2) The moving walkways are always in service.. 3) It's clean!. 4) Restrooms are abundant and easy to locate.. 5) Food options are decent, but not as plentiful as in other airports.. . Amenities and food choices could be improved upon. But overall, this airport deserves an extra star for the upkeep and friendly staffers.
I've flown out of here and had layovers. . . For layovers: Usually the airport is easy to navigate with food options clustered near the gates. I've had less than 45 minutes of a layover and still managed to make my connection with a quick wait through a food line. . . Flying out of here can be a bit more hectic. Getting through security is about average compared to other airports but this airport has a ton of flight delays. I'm not sure why this happens more when I'm visiting Phoenix versus just in for a quick layover. The airport is easy to get to with plenty of public transportation options. However, parking here can be a hassle, so it's easier to just get dropped off.
This airport is getting much better! Many, many choices (Einsteins, Joe's on the way, Cinnabon, Starbucks...) as far as where to grab a quick bite. Lots of places to charge your phone while you wait. Overall my experience with staff has been friendly (other than missing a flight on Mothers Day because of the ridiculous TSA line). And the filtered water at the drinking fountains is a huge perk in my book as well!
