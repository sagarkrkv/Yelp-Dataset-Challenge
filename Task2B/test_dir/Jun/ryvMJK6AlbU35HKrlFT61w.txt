This joint is exceptional...!!!!!!  Me and my husband have a game plan every time we go here... Try to eat as little off the salad bar as possible to try to make room for the good stuff.. And by the way the salad is like none other making it really hard to avoid.. When u flip ur button to green get ready,, there will be an onslaught  of various different slices of meat... The best quality imagined.. I would recommend saving room for the  house sirloin and the beef rib.. Is  this meat from this planet?? Out of this world!!!... The garlic mash and fried banana only compliment it even more... It's close to $50 per person but the quality of food math the food and they even offer great coupons time to time.. One of my favorite restaurants period..
Rudest hostess's at the front desk I have ever seen!! Hatefull & snotty, they really acted ugly when I let them know I was meeting a friend there & I asked if she had already arrived, their attitude was "whatever" "can't you just go look around and see for yourself?!" They actually rolled their eyes at me as if I was interrupting their all too important conversation! They obviously had more important things to do like - talk about their latest dates & escapades with each other! Then my daughter who flew in from her deployment, Air Force, totally surprised me by showing up, the manager & wait staff could of cared less!! She was in uniform & they gave us no attention what-so-ever, no discount on our food, no congrats to her, absolutely nothing!!. From that experience, I have let everyone know that comes in town to visit, Do Not go there, its over priced & very rude staff, from the manager all the way to the bottom hostess's!!!! What a complete waste of money & huge disappointment for my daughter, just back from her military deployment!
I was given a recommendation to this place by a high school friend after I had requested restaurant suggestions via FB while in Vegas. So yesterday, while strolling the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North, I decided to look up the reviews on YELP. Surprisingly, there were all positive reviews so I clicked the button to make a reservation for 8:30 p.m. . . We arrived at the restaurant at 8:00 p.m. & the place was PACKED! My husband commented that "all of Vegas" was there. After checking in, the hostess told us to stay close but that we would probably have to wait until 8:30 p.m. to be seated as they were busy. However, at 8:15 p.m. she called us & said our table was ready. Because we had never been there (but I had an idea of how the Brazilian steakhouse scene works) the waitress politely explained everything to us in a nutshell & recommended a ginger peach iced tea (it was excellent).  . . After the waitress left, we descended on the salad bar. EXCELLENT! My husband & I live in LA & frequent Fogo de Chao in Bev Hills and we both agreed that the salad bar at this place was better than Fogo's, hands down. There was an assortment of salads including the mushroom & asparagus which I loved, fresh crab sushi rolls, Brazilian balsamic vinaigrette (excellent) & even lobster bisque soup! So we piled some items on our plates & headed back to the table. . . Once at the table we turned our buttons over to green & out of nowhere men with meats descended on our table. Top sirloin, lamb chops, Parmesan chicken & filet mignon.  We got a little of everything & proceeded to eat.  . . Now I am not a big meat eater, I eat meat, but not a lot of it...but this place....this place had me on meat overload! Every piece of meat I had was EXCELLENT!!! If I could have managed to eat more, I would have. All the meats were great...no, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!!. . If you like Fogo, you will love this place & it is cheaper than Fogo's. Too bad they don't have one in LA, but whenever you are in Vegas, stop in & have brunch, lunch or dinner, you will love this place!
The food is superb. . Mashed potatoes, garlic cheese bread, lobster soup and an array of cheeses, aged salami and prosciutto served buffet style as your appetizers. Bring your appetite as the Brazilian gauchos will keep visiting your table if your circular card is green...All types of meat served off the rack. I indulged in the lamb chops, bacon wrapped chicken, and the fillet mignon. Loving the sweet fried bananas. Definitely will save up to re-visit...
Outstanding salad bar options.  Delicious meat choices.  My favorite, hands down, was the beef rib.  So juicy, succulent, and fall apart, I couldn't believe it!  Casey was our waiter and performed excellently.  Can't wait to go back!
There website sucks. I have an account and now can not make a reservation. There home page has no login icon so you can not get into your account. Then I try to make a reservation on their site and they say it may or may not be there and I need to do something to allow cookies which I have and does not restrict access to their site. So hell, I have to go back 20 years and phone for a reservation. Maybe we will just go someplace else.
Excellent selection of sides from the buffet.  With the exception of the chicken parm drumsticks, all the meat was prepared excellent!
Omg this is the best place to grub !!!! The meat is unbelievable !! P.s I'm a meat lover  lol hand owns the best place to eat
Great Restaurant   Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  You will need to bring your appetite to eat here. Very easy to make reservations through Yelp. Will definitely come back.
WOW!!!! High-Quality. . . best all you can eat Restaurant in Vegas. Not the cheapest but the best! . . Great Salat Buffet and great meat.
This place is packed to the rafters for good reason.  The meat selections are delicious.  Well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The salad bar was not impressive.  Lame spicy crab sushi rolls, small shrimp, tons of peppers and onions.  Cheeses were decent.  Lobster bisque was tasty but quite cool.. . We were seated by a snooty hostess who sneered when asked if we could adjust the table a bit. We could not talk too much because of the noise. . .  I had a caramel apple martini which was super gooey and I could not taste any apple at all.  My brother had a caparhina which was ok, not limey enough for his taste, but they fixed it to his satisfaction.  . . The table for five of us was set up very awkwardly, and we felt cramped.  Behind us was a storage cabinet for glasses which was used to stack plates for the salad bar, and that was a hub for activity.  The meat servers weren't able to access the table too easily, but they made it work.. . Cheese bread was cold, and they didn't refill it.  It was a Saturday night, super busy, but that's kind of a basic in my mind.  Mashed potatoes and fried bananas tasted fine. . . The waiter was pleasant, funny and did his best to accomodate our every wish.. . Overall worth a trip, but I would go on a weeknight when it wasn't so packed to enjoy the delicious skewered meats.  Fogo de Chao gets an extra star from me in comparison.
We used to frequent this place quite a bit, but no longer do so for several reasons:. . First let me say the food is good. Meats are cooked to perfection and the salad bar is extensive and refreshing. The salads, cheeses, and lobster bisque are all of high quality, and seasoned perfectly. . . However, the last time we went to Texas de Brazil I was greeted by a rude hostess who had no interest in accommodating a simple request (a table on the side of the Restaraunt so my children did not interrupt anyone else's meal). So when the waiter came around, I asked to be moved and the gracious waitstaff accommodated us. I simply want to be courteous to other diners and not interrupt someone else's good time if my children get restless.. . The food was excellent, and so was the service. Our waiter was attentive and provided every special request of meat that we asked for. I was not expecting what came next.... . Prices: I was expecting $45 a plate for adults, $5 for my 10 year old, and no charge for my 6 and 2 year olds, just as the snotty hostess told us. What I got when I looked at the receipt was $50 a plate for the adults, $25 for my 10 year old, and $5 each for my 6 and 2 year olds. That is not including drinks or dessert. I asked the waiter why the tab was so off, and he stated the prices had been raised. I was not advised of this, and the hostess specifically gave me different numbers. . . I paid and left. I didn't even want to both with speaking to management because I was so disgusted with the hostesses attitude and lack of knowledge which cost me an additional $45. The food is good. The overall experience is good, but Fogo de Chao gets an additional 2 stars for at least having competent, professional, and POLITE staff.
Great customer services and loved the food. . However it wasn't a comfortable experience eating their with two kids.... But my parents loved it so I think I will return next time I visit vegas again.
This is the most awesome place if you are a meat loving carnivore like me!  The luscious cuts of meat just keep on coming be careful not to put yourself in a meat coma!
Ok, I have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse. So I have nothing to compare it to. Although my husband says if his first experience would have been this one he wouldn't have been as excited to come to another one. In other words I don't know if the one he went to previously, or this one, is the norm.  Now back to what I thought. It was puny. The salad bar was so little. I felt it was a snack bar of finger foods. Good but little. The stuff to the side, au gratin potatoes and rice, was cold. Even though they were supposed to be in heated containers. The meat was all delicious. I may not have liked all of them but it wasn't because they were cooked wrong it was just a personal taste thing.  Which sums up this place for me. I personally did not like it but it was a nice restaurant.
I love this place the fried bananas are great. The salad bar is amazing so many items try the french goat cheese. Next to the soups there is some cheesy potatoes and Jasmine rice both very good.The main attraction is the Meats Brazilian Sausage so good also Lamb Chops bacon wrapped chicken and garlic Sirloin to name a few and every year they have the V.I.P card that leads to half price meals great deal. This is one of my favorite places make sure you go very hungry
Went here for the first time last night to celebrate our four year anniversary. Our server was so sweet and very attentive. She was knowledgable about the meat selection and the desserts. We really loved the flank steak, sirloin, brazilian sausage and the salad bar. The soup of the day was a delicious lobster bisque and the meal came with garlic mashed potatoes and delicious fried bananas. Highly recommend!
I will start by saying you definitely get more bang for the buck here.  Come VERY HUNGRY and get your money's worth.  And the "salad-soup" bar is pretty amazing.  I don't think I've seen anything quite like it.  The cuts of beef that they bring you are top notch as well.  And the service is excellent.  However, you really have to be a fan of Rare/Medium Rare beef.  Most of it is undercooked for me.  I like Medium to Medium Well.  The chicken is not good at all.  And the sausage is not good either.  I do enjoy going there though.  Reservations are recommended and be prepared to wait even a few minutes past your reservation as it is busy most nights.
