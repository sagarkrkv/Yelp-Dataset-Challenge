Let's be real: I don't need to write a long review. There is little to say except it's a required visit on your visit to Montreal. I've heard rumors of better places to get your viande fumee, but that doesn't matter: I went to this one, and it was fantastic. Delightfully marbled beef, tender, juicy. Yes, please. Fresh, fresh bread. The right amount of heat in the mustard. Yes.. . Hey, they have other things too! The salami is excellent (but served cold, fair warning). And yes, I do love pickles, and theirs are somehow even better than most, with just a hint of garlic. The frites, though, are meh. . . Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I be a regular? Probably not. Go to St. Viateur instead--their viande fumee is just as good, AND you get delicious, delicious bagels (and no line).
Had to try the famous smoked meats of Montreal and this seemed to be one of the most popular so we had to hunt it down and see for ourselves what all the hubub was about...worth the drive. This little Jewish Deli with the french sign is a throw back to old school Deli's that you only just see in movies unless you are lucky enough to grow up with if you grew up in certain New York neighborhoods and such...I was not one of the lucky ones so I enjoyed the heck out of the small community seating and yes, even waiting in line to get in because of the locals we had the chance to meet and chat with. Once inside, the staff was fast and friendly, making sure all kept rolling like a well oiled machine. You could tell the locals because they did not linger like us tourists but rather ate and got the heck out so others could get in...we were to busy absorbing the local culture for those kinds of niceties...that being said, they were kind enough to allow me to eat the poutine I purchased at their take out spot next door in side the Deli with the rest of my group that was having the sandwiches...they all raved about how delicious their meat was so I offered to share my poutine for some of that incredible smoked meat...it was a good trade =)
Ich hatte im lonelyplanet Montreal von Schwartz's gelesen, und als Fan von gerauchertem Fleisch war ich naturlich mehr als bereit dazu, spatabends einen Abstecher zu dem nur wenige Straen von unseren Hotel entfernten Lokal zu machen. Es war zwar schon 23.00 Uhr, aber trotzdem gab es eine Schlange bis hinaus auf die Strae. Ich entschied mich fur ein Sandwich mit mittlerem Anteil Fett im Fleisch (man kann zwischen wenig, normal und viel Fett wahlen) da es doch recht spat war. Ein Sitzplatz war nicht in Sicht, also nahm ich das Sandwich mit, konnte auf dem Heimweg aber dem aufsteigenden Geruch aus der Papiertute nicht widerstehen und kostete nur ein kleines Stuckchen. Mit dem Resulat, dass ich funf Minuten spater wieder in der Schlange wartete und mir sofort ein zweites kaufte. Das Fleisch zergeht einem auf der Zunge, unglaublich gut gewurzt, und die dezente Menge an Senf ... ein wirkliches Geschmackserlebnis! Das zweite Sandwich wurde sofort nach Ankunft im Hotel verputzt, dafur musste ich am nachsten Morgen aber auf mein Fruhstuck verzichten :) Schade dass wir nur kurz in Montreal waren, denn ich hatte gerne auch die anderen Gerichte auf der Karte probiert ... aber man darf ja noch traumen :) Wenn ich jemals wieder nach Montreal kommen sollte - ein Besuch bei Schwartz s ist ein absolutes Muss!
Went to Schwartz's on a Tuesday around 3:30, so no real line to speak of. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich fatty, with mustard, a pickle, coleslaw and cherry soda. I am from NYC and have had my fair share of corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. The brisket here is milder tasting than NYC pastrami, but it was tender and the hint of smoke with the fat from the point was simply delectable. However, the ends of the rye bread refused to yeild when bitten into, and destroyed the structure of the sandwich. I ended up with meat falling all over the plate ,and having to piece the sandwich back together. Everyone at my table had the same problem. Really killed the experience for me. . I say try it if you've never been, but it was nothing to write home about for me.
A new co-worker was in town and wanted to try the best smoke meat around...  Of course Schwartz's was the first name that came to my mind.  I haven't been there in the last few years, but, as usual, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.. . You have to be ready to wait 30 minutes is you get there at lunch time (and that was only for take out...  Not taking about the dining room).. . Great sandwich, great pickle... If you have to have one of these sandwich, order a medium cut or don't go!
I went through quite the trek to try a sandwich from Schwartz's, and it was more than worth it!. . Great service, cheap, and very filling. Really can't ask for anymore. Get the smoked meat sandwich, you know you want to -- simple and delicious! You're missing out if you try anything else.
World famous smoke meat! What more can i say. The best smoke meat in the world. Nuff said. Amazing quality, original and authentic. Highly recommended when in Montreal
Visit for the experience. The servers will tell you not to bother ordering anything but the smoked meat. The servings are somewhat enormous. Terrific people-watching, entertaining wait staff, definite Montreal experience.
This is the place I ran into my acquaintance who was also visiting from New York. This could say how hot this spot is. Meat is still good, oh yeah~
the medium smoked meat sandwich is a MUST HAVE. get with a cherry soda and pickles!. . i'm not usually into sandwiches, but this was probably my favorite food place in montreal. i went twice during my trip!. . amazing food and service - definitely recommend!
I was raised as a devout Christian until the age of about 13 when I decided I would rather not spend two minutes before every meal appealing to a deity who I didn't believe in or spend Sundays uncomfortably sitting next to strangers who seemed to like to give away money to tax-free organizations whose pockets seemed to continue swelling while the "missions" they supported seemed to keep suffering in comparison.. . My gripes with organized religion aside, until I went to college, my impression of Jewish food consisted only of things that were somewhat hinted in the bible about the Israelites' travails in the desert -- I think up until about 18 I believed that the story of the Jews were that of an overzealous nation led by a capricious voice in the sky who pretty much gave and took away land from his/her own people, while at the same time depriving them culinarily by forcing them to eat unleavened bread and order well-done steaks all the time.. . I was pleasantly surprised, when I was first introduced to a proper reuben at Schilo's Deli in San Antonio, and my perception and admiration of Jewish cuisine had been on the rise ever since then; from that point I made it a point to pilgrimage all the holy sites of all that is bagel and/or smoked meat -- I never even once would have imagined that one of those holy sites would have been in the beautiful city of Montreal.. . If you've read this far in my review, you'll notice that I have yet to make a single constructive comment that would be construed as being part of a review. That's because I haven't. I can't quite put into words what I think about Schwartz's, because it's so very much like every landmark Jewish deli I've been to, but at the same time so different as well.. . The atmosphere at Schwartz's is one you'd expect from any popular establishment in a bustling city. I've walked and passed by Schwartz's at least four times and each time there was a huge line in front of both the restaurant and the take out area. Whereas the take out area is indeed miles faster than waiting in line to be seated at the restaurant, you still have to wait about 30-35 minutes to get your hands on any sort of tangible food while having to suffer through the alluring aroma of freshly-drained, smoked-for-many-hours meat invading ever orifice of your body as you stand (yes, your dog will love the way you smell after you leave this place). . The food here is mindblowing if you've never tried a brisket/smoked meat sandwich before. If you have, it's just like anything you'd get at Katzs'/Second Ave/Herschel's, except Schwartz's sandwich packs in around the same amount of meat as the aforementioned places (except for Second Ave's. Nothing beats a whole pound of brisket sloshed in between two pieces of rye bread) into three tiny pieces of white, almost wonderbread-esque bread (think Texas BBQ.) It's almost like a poorly constructed Pyramid that was built to preserve a cow that met a horrifying death, and if that wasn't enough, incinerated extremely slowly so to keep all its juices locked into the flesh. Disturbing mental images aside, it's pretty amazing.. . The price point is probably what sets Schwartz's apart from most of the Jewish delis I've been to. Whereas you'll come out of places like Katzs' and Second Ave about 20-25 dollars poorer after a meal, Schwartz's only charges 7.75 CAD per sandwich. One can maybe make the argument that Katzs' and Second Ave makes up the difference in the amount of time you don't spend waiting for your food(nothing beats being able to walk up to the Sandwich line at Katzs', sampling the specimen from whence your sandwich meat came, and watching it being constructed right before your eyes within 2 minutes of entering the establishment.) My friend and I saw the pictures online and made the mistake of thinking that one sandwich would not be filling enough and that we'd each need to order two or three. That was also a huge mistake.. . All in all a great establishment in a great part of town. I'd definitely recommend Schwartz's as a part of the Montreal experience to anyone visiting the city. I don't know if their online catering/order service delivers to the US as well, but I'm really kicking myself for not grabbing one of their ready-to-heat brisket vacuum paks for my drive home.
Whenever I'm in Montreal I make sure I get at least one lunch at Schwartz.  The smoked meat sandwich, sour pickle and fries is the standard.  The service is fast and the food is great.. . This is the authentic Jewish deli experience.  Treat yourself to a real Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and a real Jewish deli, this is it.
I visited Schwartz probably between 5-10 times within the past 4-5 years. In older times, my experience would be summarized with dry-tasteless meat and dry bread. After so many disappointments, I finally had a nice smoked meat sandwich last time. I  wouldn't go there if my guest didn't insist. I won't go there again unless: a friend visits Montreal and insists of going to Schwartz because you cannot visit and leave Montreal without visiting Schwartz, because there is a line of people in front of the restaurant and so many people cannot fail to appreciate a good restaurant. .  . Let me try to explain how I see this place. Schwartz reminds me of a hybrid of two types of restaurant.. My hometown for example, is famous for its kebabs. There are kebab restaurants in town that are old & historic and available in tourism books as recommended restaurants.. However locals don`t really to these restaurants. The common sense says that these restaurants generally lack the food quality but compensate it with their historical values. So you generally end up paying for the general experience but not for tasty good.  A gastronomical disappointment in general. Locals go to other restaurants for better food experience. A second kind of restaurant is where everyone goes, where it is always crowded, a place that is talk of the town.. And every client who frequent that restaurant knows that there are better restaurants in the same city. They go to that restaurant because it is "hip" and "popular". Eventually, people move on and they find a new hip restaurant in the city. Just like a pop song, eventually that "hip" restaurant becomes old fashioned, thrash and not worth a visit..  . . Schwartz reminds me a combination of these two types of restaurants. Yes, it is a historic restaurant.. However, historic restaurants have a certain quality to them. I once took a good look at the drinking glasses at Schwartz. I don't want to know how old they are. You must all have heard about news about people's unexpected generosities on Internet. Like that waitress who got 1000$ tip for a 20$ meal, or that guy who spent 500$ at a coffee shop to give away free coffees to people. If I had the resources to perform such generosities, I'd spend a grand and give a thousand brand new drinking glasses to Schwartz. They need brand new stuff in their shop. Same thing goes for the overall hygiene of the place. I think "a restaurant having character" does not mean "a dirty, chaotic, run-down place". Well, as long as Montrealers have a common belief that the older, the dirtier, the sketchier it is, the more character it has, I don't expect it any kind of change in this place.. You can drink from a 30 year old drinking glass and feel privileged for doing that so. This place needs a good deal of renovations. . . This next point is something that bothered me more than the drinking glasses..  You can't pay with credit card at Schwartz. Here is my message to to the owners (or investors) of this restaurant. You people have a restaurant on St. Laurent which is frequented by so many people. You have queues in front of your store. People wait for 20-25 minutes just to get in. You are not a family-run convenience store,where profit margins are narrow, which can't afford 3.5% commission on credit card payments. What kind of logical reason do you have for not accepting credit cards? I only hope that their excuse is not "preserving the traditions and character" of your restaurant. Not everyone is fool enough to believe that. I believe there is only one reason and it is that they love "cash". They just want to to maximize their profits as much as they can and don't bother to offer credit card payments because there is an ending supply of clients thanks to travelling books, magazines, the promotional materials of the city and the Montrealers. You can go and visit a holiday resort in a country, where lots of Canadians would describe as "3rd world country" and there is a credit card terminal.. How come a restaurant that -probably- makes millions of dollars in sale in a city like Montreal, on a street like St. Laurent doesn't have a credit card terminal.. I can't believe this.. . In my last visit, I had to watch our waitress struggling when he was about to give me the change. It took a while until he prepares the change. I am not sure why.. I don't know if he really struggled with the calculations or he simply expected me to say "that's fine, keep the change". I hope it is the former. . . I won't give this restaurant 1 star. 1-star would be too cruel. 1-star means "hate". I don't hate it.. I hope they would try to make the place  cleaner with better customer service. It is just a restaurant where it receives endless supply of clients and I guess they believe this is what everyone likes. They don't bother to make it better. . . I hope that one day a Montrealer will tell me about a restaurant where it is clean, affordable, value their customers with tasty smoked meat.
would not recommend this place - they have a hidden 12$ card minimum and are totally not negotiable about this. they should be way way more up front!
This place is a must especially for any tourist.. . I eat here several times a month. Best smoked meat in Montreal.
Best smoked meat in the city. Wait in line during the day or evenings, or go there after a night of drinking when there is less of a wait. Fantastically delicious, fatty and flavourful
Smoked meat is my jam so you know I was all up in this piece when I was recently in Montreal. The sandwich was so good. The atmosphere is awesome. A total old school diner throwback feel. So glad we sought this place out and walked all over Montreal just to get to it.
Cash only.  The smoked beef is amazing.  The waiter kindly led us through our first experience - I would recommend just asking them for their advice and doing what they say.  There was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly.  Prepare for a quick, good meal.  We would definitely eat there again - prices were affordable, portions were filling, food was delicious.
It's not a place you're likely to visit as a local but it's an easy place to find yourself when you're showing around tourists. The smokes meat a good if you take it spicy, but other than that it's just a random restaurant that serves decent food in a New York Diner atmosphere. The saving grace is the staff. Our 50+ year old waiter was a total boss. He had nicknamed the one guy at out table "princess" five minutes into our visit and it stuck. He was fun, quirky, informative and a great time.
I visited Schwartz's again during the evening hour on my recent visit to MTL, it was fairly busy and I ordered a large plate of meat with a pickle. Some how this visit did not bring me back the memories from my first visit a few years back. I found the meat a bit dry and Dunn's like. I specifically told the waiter to bring me fatty meat, but the meat did not have that melt in your mouth tasty sensation. Don't get me wrong, the food was still good, but not the same as I had remembered. This difference may be attributed to the fact that my first Schwartz experience was in the morning when the meat was fresh, moist and straight out of the Big plastic coolers they store their meat in.  I'd still recommend Schwartz, but try to go in the morning at 10:30am when they start serving FRESH meat.
I went on a Saturday just before lunch time and there was a line of people waiting outside of the store which I believe is a normal thing, I wasn't bothered by the wait because I was drawn there by the reputation and my curiosity out weighed my impatience.  . When I got to the front I ordered a smoked meat sandwich with a side of pickle and fries. I absolutely loved it. The meat is the best smoked meat I have ever had and the pickle went really well with it. The fries are tasty and crispy. . May I add, this sandwich killed my hangover which is an added bonus.
My boyfriend and I bixi biked our way to Schwartz's just for lunch. I ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich and he got the smoked meat poutine.. . Perhaps I'm not a fan of deli meat becauseI didn't find anything special about this restaurant at all. The meat was tender but overly salty and tasted very average to me. The poutine was huge and the fries were okay. I must say that I do prefer the poutine over the sandwich because there was less meat in the poutine so it was less overwhelming.. . I don't think I'll be coming back here the next time I visit Montreal since there are so many other restaurants around the area.
