Coming  from the chaos that is JFK international in NY I guess every airport seems exceptionally civilized and clean. There is definitely NO question as to where you are because the second you step off the plane the slot machines are waiting for you
You know that you are in the Vegas airport because there are slot machines right at the gates! The ease of everything  at this airport is just like those slot machines; right there and highly convenient. It is really easy to navigate this airport for the size of it. . . It is easy to find your driver near the luggage with their digital signs. It is also easy to pick up and return rental cars. The shuttle is close and runs by the terminals often. I like this airport.
While this is now a finished product - what an abortion if your party come in on different airlines.. . Poor directions and even worse common meeting areas.. . Rental car is 10+ minutes from the airport ( yes, the strip is closer ). . I travel frequently . . . Miami is the only one I hate to visit more for similar reason : functional . . . It is one thing to be drunk tourist ( minus the multiple arrivals at same time ) . . . But add a car . . . Functional ( only one ) that does not imply good nor useful
They're continuously improving all parts of this airport. I wish they had better dining options at all terminals and gates. Easy to get to, efficient cab line (no matter how long it is) and Starbucks everywhere.
MaCarran Airport is truly made with the traveler in mind. It sits right next to the strip so you can quickly hit the casinos and everything they have to offer. If your flight is delayed there is entertainment in the form of slot machines...am I sensing a pattern??. . If you are picking someone up at the baggage area you will find that there are three escalators bringing people from the gates to baggage. There is no way to tell which escalator they will be coming down so you will just have to watch the flow of people.. . As a backup plan we always tell incoming visitors to meet us at the Starbucks in baggage claim. It is about half way down on the left when coming off the escalators.
The best rhing about this airport is the wheel of fortune slot machines!  Just won a quick hundy but this place has gotten really eun dkwn and nasty. How about fixing the place up?  Security, TSA sucks and they are soooooo slow!  C gate is off the normal path and i recall the other side and gates a lot nicer. Glad to be going home!
I only give the airport 2 stars because, true to Vegas' reputation, gambling machines everywhere, including right in front of the baggage claim in case your airline takes too long to deliver, and for having a proper liquor store inside the baggage claim in terminal 1. Otherwise, this is a pretty inconvenient airport. The only water you can easily find is bottled and thrice the normal price (even more expensive than San Francisco). If you are waiting for someone on another flight, and you go to collect checked luggage, say goodbye to food options.  It is confusing to get around, and once out of the TSA cleared area, it is hard to find employees to answer questions. The people around seem to be pretty nice, but it isn't passenger friendly once you grab your checked luggage.
The line to get a cab here is FREAKING RIDICULOUS.. . It's like a maze of ropes --literally walking from one end of the airport to the other end.. and then doing it again. maybe like 4x???? . . I stood there; and honestly was able to memorize people's shoes to match with their outfits. Yah. the wait was that long; i had to create a game in my head to keep me entertained.. You can't help but see them over and over and OVER again.. . So if you're going in the summer.. make sure you wear comfortable shoes if you have to take a cab....there's going to be a lot of walking to get a cab if there's a line.. wear sunscreen, have some water handy, have a facial spray mist..and learn to breathe.. . Also if you're going carrying a heavy duffle back?? don't do it.. get those rollies.
I have been to a lot of airports but this place is just a madhouse. This airport is way to small and over crowded and they really need to think about expanding this place. The food options are crappy and mostly just fast food, they offer free wifi but its pretty much useable, and there restrooms here are pretty disgusting. The only good thing about this place is the taxi services/ limo services and the baggage arrivals.
This airport is so-so.. One of the things that bothers me is how early you have to make your way to the airport if you want to be on time. Especially if you have a rental car to return. I find the time needed to get from your hotel/home in Vegas to through security and at your gate, is much more time than at other similar airports in other cities.. . Gates can be somewhat far from check-in, or take a long time to get to after security. The rental car complex is FAR from the airport and adds at least 30-45 minutes to your trip to the airport. I can only imagine how many hungover tourists have missed their flights due to not factoring in the car rental return time. This is a pretty serious miscalculation on the part of an airport that is so especially focused on the tourist "what happens in Vegas..." crowd.. . On my last visit, I put $5 in the slot machine at the gate for my departure (I don't usually gamble at all, but I was headed back to Canada and thought it would be as good a chance as any to get rid of my small US dollar bills...and hey luck is luck right?).. Well not exactly.. I put my $5 in, won $10..and.......drum roll.....the machine had a paper jam! The attendant just refused to give me my money back, instead calling a supervisor... whom I didn't see arrive because they were calling my name at the gate at this point and I had to scram or miss my flight (after all that extra planning to get there on time!!!).. . No need to reiterate that this kind of stuff is completely unacceptable at an airport like LAS
This is specifically for the TSA staff - if you don't like your damn job, thengo out and find another one. I felt like I was in a prison the way I treated. It is ridiculous. . I went to Vegas to enjoy myself, not be treated like some subservient low life!
For the amount of people that come into and out of Lost Wages. McCarran is an amazing airport. Food is blah but the buildings are clean, cool, and well laid out.. . The city keeps adding to the capacity and that has made a huge difference.. . I highly recommend Virgin America to McCarran.
Why no power for recharging?  You gotta get with the times and add power. Every seat needs a plug. EVERY. People sitting on the floor along walls is super lame. And it's about 82 degrees in here. Have you not heard of AC? Get with it Vegas Airport.
Great airport ! Nicely thought out , and even tho I live here , from the moment you step off your plane , you know you are in Vegas , due to all the ads and billboards , telling you how much fun you are going to have here , getting drunk, laid or that you have to see one of the many cirque shows here !! Thank goodness they have toned down some of the  ads , cuz even tho I don't have kids , you might have to have "the talk" with them after passing thru this airport !!
For the size of this airport, McCarran does its job very well. Not OMG spectacular awesome, but efficient enough that I was able to make my international flight even though I arrived only an hour before departure.. . As of today I now have experience with both terminals. Terminal 1, in my opinion, is much older, and I highly prefer flying out of Terminal 3. The international airlines, however, are situated the furthest from the ground transportation area, and therefore is quite a long walk. However, the place was quite quiet for a Tuesday night, and the baggage tag-in process went smoothly (we checked in online the night before; yay Air Canada!).. . Security was smooth, again probably because we didn't travel during peak periods. If you're in D gates, you will have to ride the tram, which is about a 45 second ride. Also, no duty free in the D gates!. . I hear several stories of 3-4 hour waits at check-in/security lines on weekend afternoons. I'll reserve that judgment if I ever experience it, but for non-peak times this is probably one of the most efficient airports I've been to for one this size.
Awww, McCarran airport. You're big, but I never have issues with you. And people watching here is awesome.. . If you're a first time Vegas visitor, you will be welcomed with the sound of lots of slots machines. Fair warning: Gaming at the airport is not a wise idea.. . The passenger pickup area can be crazy at times. Skip it and go for the short term parking instead. You get 15 mins free and don't have to worry about circling or the long line of cars. Very late at night when it's kinda dead, no one cares if you idle for awhile at the passenger pickup curb.. . If flying out of the C gates, ignore the signs and what you are told. Proceed instead to follow the A, B, and D gates signs. Next to the D gates, there's a little entrance to the C gates. There's never a line and I always breeze through in record time.. . If you're a smoker, there's a smoking gaming area on concourse D, as well as a smoking bar outside of the D gates.. . There's plenty of places to eat and drink, albeit none good. If hankering for food, you're better off dining after security than before it.
A really nice airport. Clean, easy to figure out, and excellent food and drink options. I appreciate a large international airport that maximizes its space so you're not walking for (what feels like) miles and miles. . . And it's entertaining to watch the last-minute gamblers trying the slots, and those still hung over from the night before navigating the terminals. Think of it as dinner and a show.
Super clean, huge airport. Maybe it seems as if there aren't any people here because the terminals are so spread out. . . This place is like a super mall and casino all in one.. . We usually rate the airport by how many Starbucks are inside after security, and that alone gives this airport a 5 star!
Nice airport. Easy navigating. I like their set up. Clean and friendly. Slot machines, incase you can't get started soon enough or maybe you didn't get enough, either way they are there. Very large duty free store. Nice selections inside. Restaurant selection is okay. Nothing to rave about.
The bar is close to everything.
Airport is not too bad. Lines can get long at times. The free wifi by the airport is awesome.
Small airport. Biggest qualm - lack of actual restaurants to sit down at. TONS of mostly unhealthy fast food options but where are the restaurants once inside the gates!?. Security can sometimes be slow and they ALWAYS run out of bins...and do not refill. Get on your A-game McCarran!. Wait time for check in doesn't typically take long here but there are definitely long lines and even longer lines if you are trying to take a cab.
Not sure which dump of a terminal Spirit Airlines flies into since McCarran sucked the last time I was here, but Terminal D is AWESOME. It's shiny and new and has tons of places to eat/shop/whatever while you wait to leave vegas. Everyone seems much happier than at the terminal I was at for Spirit.. . Check out the AmEx lounge across from gate D1 if you have an AmEx card! It's pretty awesome!
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #158 - #365. .  McCarran International Airport has gone though a massive renovation to entice travelers to travel and stay in Las Vegas. Advertisements from every show and hotel on the strip will be found here in any of their LED screens. . . In one part of the airport, you can check into your hotel right away before even stepping into your registered hotel. This airport is unlike no other and is quite unique in my opinion. Slot machines all around this airport with the sound of the slots in the background give it that Vegas vibe. . . Sometimes you'll see commercials of Carrot Top, Blue Man Group, Jawacobes doing commercials for airport safety. Quite comedic if you ask me. LOL . . Staff here are always moving just like Las Vegas is on the go. Outside you'll run into more commercials ads from the hotels and casinos to again entice you to stay and gamble. Limos and cabs are endless and you'll never have to wait too long for a ride. . . Viva Las Vegas!
You either love this place or hate it, depending on how your weekend goes. Kudos to letting me gamble (and lose) one last time before I head back home ;)
The TSA security check in is hit or miss, this time didn't take long but they were not refilling the tubs fast enough so you have to wait on them. . . I left Houston yesterday and didn't have to take shoes/coat off, nor pull laptop out of the bag. However, that wasn't the case here in Las Vegas. . . Flying out of gate d50 and nothing decent to eat or drink unless you want fast food or Starbucks. So if you're looking for something decent and near gate d50...go fish. . . My one major complaint about this terminal is you have to take the tram, you cannot just walk around. Especially, since the tram ride is maybe 15seconds at best. Just seems silly that you wait longer for the tram then the actual ride. . . Safe travels to all!
For a busy airport, McCarran is very good airport.  If you're flying in and out of the new Terminal 3, it is really fantastic.  It is not as busy, and ticketing/TSA security is normally a breeze.  In Terminal 1, especially on Southwest, it can be a headache, because it's so busy.  It really needs a Dunkin' Donuts or a Tim Hortons though.  The concession choices are terrible for an airport of its magnitude.  The coffee choices are really terrible.  But overall, I never mind flying in and out of this airport.
I hate this airport I always get lost. The driver can never find me I just hate it. Literally it took the driver like an hour to find me.
I like the new terminal 3. Since I always fly Alaska Air this is where I end up. The new terminal very clean and modern. They have some decent food options from what I can tell but I've only really tried the Burger King. Be warned though as the security line can get pretty long here, but at least it moves very fast.
This airport is like any other. Super close to the strip so the taxi is less than 20$ depending on where you stay. I noticed that the can ride from the airport to the strip cost more (2$ on top of your can fare) than from the strip to the airport...why? I have no idea.. All the food places here are over priced so try and eat before. Starbucks is 5$ for an Americano...but it's Vegas and an airport.
It's an airport.  It's ok.  Nothing special.  It's not bad but it gets me to and form where I need to go!
