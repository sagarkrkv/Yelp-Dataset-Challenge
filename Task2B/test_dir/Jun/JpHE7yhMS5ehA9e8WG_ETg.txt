In the context of this review understand that the expectations for a stay in ANY five-star Hotel are very rigid & though our overall experience quite pleasant, we were a bit disappointed by our recent stay despite getting an amazing rate.  Our first room hit the mark for luxury in vegas - Absolutely baller - but the second had a different lay-out, was in a "forgotton corridor of the hotel" & there were oversights in the housekeeping (trash under under one of the chairs) & the room smelled a bit like cleaning solution when we walked in though looked a little less manicured than the previous & some of the amenities didn't work like they had in the first room we grabbed (the night prior).  . . Overall it was a pretty manageable from an admin point of view (checking-in / Free Self-park / helpful bell-desk) and far less cumbersome than other casino / resorts we've stayed at.  The natural light in the property & the tall vaulted ceilings makes for a less "Vegas-ey" type of experience in a really good way.  The dining options overall were okay -  The Tapas place is extraordinary & the POOL is also one of the best amenities.  Avoid the 20 min trek from the room & 30 min line at the Starbucks on the promenade level by ordering a carafe of coffee to your room!
Ok...seriously, can they just stop pumping in all that oxygen into the rooms?  I know they want their guests to be awake so that they can get them onto the casino floor or so that they won't be able to concentrate well when they do gamble, but geez, ease up on the O2 so people can rest.. . Aside from that, clean and big hotel rooms.  Its got a fridge with a weight sensor so you basically can't use it for yourself.  Bathrooms are nice but we ended up just getting the shower sans bathtub...bummer.. . The pools are nice except when you go in the afternoon.  Imagine people with their drinks enjoying the pool so much that they don't want to get out.  This translates to murky waters if you know what I mean.  But this is really something that the hotel can't enforce so you're better off swimming in the morning when there are likely fewer golden streams.. . Overall, location is super and the rooms and pools are nice.  Buffet is nothing special but you're in a central area and you do have  good access to other surrounding casinos with options.
Upon arrival for our company trip we each had been assigned the standard entry level mountain view room. I called in advance for a $30 upgrade of the strip view which I felt was reasonable and worth the 30 dollars.. . We walked in and loved the plushness and decor of the room, soon after their was a short in the electronics (drapes, sheers, lights, a/c all shut down/off after 15 minutes). The front desk offered to send maintenance up to help and because we didn't want to wait around for maintenance we requested a room change. Just before we gathered our bags to move, housekeeping knocked and then immediately proceeded to enter into our room and asked if we needed a feather duster - WHAAAT?. The next room (three doors down) reeked of perfume. The front desk manager then offered an air purifier - WHAAAT? High end looking hotel with low end functioning and service. 1 Star (or O Stars) so far right?. . So now the decision that we faced was to leave the hotel where our entire company group was staying or get some form of miracle and/or radical change.. . Get a Sky Suite for impeccable plush pampering. We had a Penthouse Sky Suite (about twice the cost of the standard rooms). There are Sky Suite Villas which are about four times the cost of the standard rooms).  The housekeepers in that building wouldn't even think of barging into your room while you are still in it! Very clean, very light, very bright, very luxurious. Most of the concierge desk associates are knowledgeable and accommodating, as are the the lounge attendants. The housekeepers are the best!. . Stay in the Sky Suites for an unforgettable experience.
I came here for a business trip and really like my room. My favorite part was the tub! However there was this constant buzzing noise near the ac which was pretty annoying. Otherwise the room is large and modern.
This is the first hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas and I was not disappointed! The aria is clean and beautiful and offered an oasis when you were ready to return home after a long day/night in busy Vegas. When first arriving in the hotel it's true there is a line to check in. But their are lines in every major hotel in Vegas. We were checked in in less than 30 minutes by a very friendly front desk worker who upgraded our room view as well as sending a complementary graduation gift to our room (best rice crispy treats ever!). . . The hotel elevators are not farfrom the check in desk and run very fast. The room itself was clean, modern and all of our room technology worked great for us. The bed was huge and comfortable, with clean sheets. Oh also, apparently you can have your room cleaned two times a day (which is excessive for me, but maybe some people like that) and the cleaning staff was always super friendly and attentive. In fact all the staff were wonderful except for a woman who worked at the pastry cafe, but hey I can live with one rude staff member. . . The bathrooms in the room were HUGE. Double vanity sink area with plenty of storage space. The large bathtub is located in the shower which was really cool. The shampoo and soap products they provided were so divine. They smell like citrus and green tea mixed together. It just all felt so fancy.. . The casino had all the games every casino in Vegas has but it was very clean and did not smell like smoke, which is a plus in my book. Also, the concierge desk at this hotel is wonderful! We must have contacted them a dozen times and they were always friendly, polite, and willing to give different suggestions based on your price range. They made our trip more enjoyable and adventurous! . . The pools were nice, if a little bit ordinary compared to other things available on the strip. I mean it's kinda hard to compete with a lazy river when you don't have one lol. The one thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about this hotel was the poolside food/drink service. We wanted to order some food for by the pool(because you cannot order food at the bar) and we were never served after waving down at least 5 different servers. Apparently only certain girls could serve certain sections of the pool due to union issues, but we just wanted to be feed. It was weird, we got food elsewhere. . . It is also important to note that my boyfriend and I stayed here on weekday nights with a significantly cheaper price on rooms. I don't know if I could ever bring  myself to spend $400 plus on a room for one night, or if it would ever meet my expectations for that price tag. But in my experience it was a wonderful hotel that I would recommend to family and friends staying in Las Vegas!
I've stayed at a lot of properties in Vegas.  Planet Hollywood was my "go to" because of location and no resort fees, but they changed their resort fee policy and my last experience there wasn't good. . . Aria is great.   It's clean, the casino is well laid out.  I wasn't constantly lost, which let me tell you - that's a big plus for me.  The staff are friendly.  The room was nice - a few minor issues here and there, which were promptly attended too.  The beds super comfy.  . . There are TONS of options for food and drink, though I didn't love the patisserie.  . . We splurged one day and got a cabana by the pool.  They have some specials right now, so definitely look into it.  I would have lasted about an hour at the pool without it.  With the cabana we made it the whole day (though the food menu at the pool was mediocre.). . My only complaint about Aria, is I felt SO nickled and dimed.  I you lift something from the mini bar for over 60 seconds you are charged, if you use the mini bar fridge for personal use, you are charged a $25.00 a day personal use fee - ridiculous.  Coffee was like $4.00.  It's just getting ridiculous in Vegas, and I still gamble, so I resent all those extra hits.  . . That aside, I would stay at Aria again.  GREAT location, accessible to anything you could possibly need, and easy to get around.
So I live in Vegas and thought why not go check out the Aria.  That was obviously a mistake I experienced the worst customer service of my life from every employee.  When my friends come visit Vegas I will be sure to tell them to stay anywhere but the Aria and I wont be comeing back
Awesome place. Great rooms.
I really liked the rooms here, and I loved the fact that I could control the entire room including the bathroom lights from the tablet located next to the bed. A few negatives were room service, I waited on hold 20 mins before calling the PBX operator who connected me to another line where they picked up right away. Also not a fan of the pillows, there were lots of them but after 20 mins of resting your head on one you could feel your head sink to the bottom of the pillow. Overall I would stay here again.
Are u kidding???. U have to ask for drink tkts. What a f$&@in joke. Get with it man. We spent hundrds of dollars @ u have to ask for drinks or pay??. Wtf??
Expensive hotel,terrible staff,,specially valet guys and customer service. Is suck..i have been most of hotel in Vegas,this one is the most terrible hotel I ever been..never gonna go back again..terrible experience...extra tips is ,,do not go there... motel6 in Vegas even got better customer service..
Shady rolled in to Aria to begin his highly controversial 8 night -all fun- stay in Vegas. Having stayed all over the strip the past 6 years, Shady was ready to take on M Lifes' top prop. Sitting square in between the ultra quiet Vdara and the ultra raucous Cosmo, Aria fit the bill for the first half of the sojourn. The second half was at Cosmo so the relative quiet of Aria was welcome. Upscale, attractive, with very very reasonably priced rooms for the quality and service, Aria makes the short list of possible returns. Jean Phillipe Patissierie square in the middle of the casino is a BIG problem for Shady and his sweet tooth. Multiple gelato/espresso/chocolate runs were needed to deal with all the ?stress?  Rooms are very comfortable, high tech. People claim to have problems figuring the entertainment system. What? really? These same  people have analog stereo's and tube t.v's as well. Casino is nicely laid out, not a lot of smoke. Shady spent a fair amount of time at the sports book and hit every bar multiple times. Not really a "singles" kinda place, Aria seemed most fit for couples. Pools, all three (not Liquid), were nice and easily accessible at all times. Seems the front pool was a nice mix, the middle pool a little more rowdy(closest to the bar!) and the back pool most quiet. Having Crystals next door is a plus, unless, like Shady,  you decide to take a special someone for a little shopping. Bring the black card. Easily accessible to Cosmo next door, Aria offers a nice retreat in Vegas. Shady and VERY LUCKY guest spent an entire afternoon at the luxurious spa-thai yoga massages, hot stone massages, reflexology, pools, hot tubs, saunas, steams, nice  workout area-it has it all. As nice as Canyon Ranch at Venetian/Palazzo. Shady was very happy with Aria, and puts it right there with Venetian/Palazzo as a go to place with  a lucky guest. V/P, because of the suite-rooms is a better option for groups.Cosmo is still tops for a boys/girls trip.  But you cant go wrong at Aria. Food options are plentiful and Shady hit 'em all !
Great Mlife Hotel and Casino.  New and refreshing.  You walk in and you aren't blown over by the 50 year old cigarette smoke.  Beautiful fresh floral decorations throughout the lobby.  I usually stay at the MGM or the MGM Signature and decided to switch it up during my last visit. . . Rooms are great.  Automated everything.  You can control the blinds from your bed and when you're hungover Sunday morning, that's an excellent feature.. . My boyfriend got a hair cut and I got a blow out at the salon in the hotel.  Costly, but its all part of the fun!  I think i'd try the spa next time. . . Knocked 1 star off for the pool.  Understaffed pool area for a Saturday.  There was 2 cocktail waitresses wandering around, extremely busy and it was impossible to get a drink.  I  ended up having to go wait 35 min in line at the outside bar!  Also, get to the pool early, lounge chairs go fast!
One of the best hotels on the strip by far. The location is perfect, dead center in the street. It's located in an upscale part of the strip called City Center which is surrounded by luxury stores such as Tom Ford, Dolce & Gabbana and Stella McCartney. Stayed here since a very close friend of mine works in management for MGM Hotels and got me good hookups.. . I arrived at check in around 12pm and they wereable to get me a room despite it being 3 hours before check-in. Staff was very helpful and the line was moving quick. . . The casino isn't a cheesy, smoke smelling casino like others found on the strip. Although smoking is allowed, you can hardly smell the smoke. The food/drink options are phenomenal! So many places to eat or drink. My favorite was Javier's and Julian Serrano.  Nightlife  there really isn't anything too hip happening except Haze nightclub sometimes. Crowd was fairly good, not many douchebags. Mostly couples and professionals in their late 20's and 30's. Pools weren't as crowded as others on the strip.. . The rooms are comfortable and very clean. House keeping really does a great job at cleaning your room. Love the technology incorporated in the room, as well as the tub and shower. Room service was also great! Left my room completely trashed one day due to heavy partying, went downstairs to get brunch with a girlfriend and came back it was impeccably clean and she even organized all my clothes/shoes. I called the front desk to give her praise and leave her a tip, she was amazing! . . I just wish the rooms had more color and a more boutique feel to them like the Cosmo has. The room was nice but it was just full of brown and neutral tones. Pops of color would have been nice.. . Pros:. Elegant, Luxurious, Modern. Good crowd . Great dining options. Clean room. Good Service. Location. Great stores . . Cons:. A bit of a walk to get to the strip . Casino isn't as lively . Nightlife isn't really popping . LONG walk to rooms . Water wasn't working on the Sunday I stayed and they still charged me Resort Fee. Wi-Fi wasn't working on the following Monday and still charged me a Resort Fee. . Great for couples and families who want an elegant and modern place to stay and enjoy Las Vegas. If you're looking to party with your girlfriends or have a bachelor party or just want something more lively but still elegant and modern I'd say stay next door at The Cosmopolitan. . Update: Management messaged me and comped me my resort fee for the day the wi-fi and water wasn't working plus comped me my room service charges those days. I did not complain at all other than write a review. Great staff!. . Update 2: Stayed here again over July 4th weekend. Had a small issue and they took care of it ASAP. Ryan Gregory provided outstanding service to me due to the incident. Will deff be returning back!
The Aria is probably the SEXIEST Vegas casino/hotel. It's NEW VEGAS at its best. . . Pros:. -Convenient location: smack dab in the middle of the Strip, next to the Bellagio, and across from Paris Hotel and Planet Hollywood. . -Cirque du Soleil: home to Zarkana, so hotel guests have no excuse not to see one of Vegas' famous Cirque du Soleil shows. . -Sweet Tooth: JEAN PHILIPPE PATISSERIE!!! Macarons and other desserts are a bit pricey, but hey, it's Vegas. Satisfy your sweet tooth and budget your dinner.. . -Aria Cafe: Service here can be a bit slow and annoying, but at least there's a beautiful view.. . -THE ART: One of the most underrated aspects of Aria is the art. There's a couple art galleries and stores and of course, art scattered all across the hotel.
Wowwwww! I loooove Aria!! They have such a nice room, I absolutely loved it! It's also pretty close to the strip, so you can pretty much walk to everything.. . We booked the room using Hotwire, which makes it soooo much cheaper. We got to stay at the Aria during father's day weekend for about $100-ish per night? My bf booked it so i'm not sure the exact price, but I just know that it was significantly cheap! :). . The room is veryyyyy nice. Got a nice queen size bed and once you walk in, the curtains automatically open up and you can see your view! We didn't have the best looking view cause we were on the 8th floor, but it's no big deal lol since we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel anyways.. . The bathroom is gorgeous too! The toilet was separated with its own little room next to  the sink area. They have 2 sinks to use and they even had a shower area PLUS a hot tub!!! I'm happy that I got to use the hot tub at least one time :) It was very cozy and super comfortable. They have a fridge but it's packed with their drinks / snacks so you don't have any room to put your own stuff in there. If you want to ice your stuff, you can always use the hot tub and fill it up with ice lol.. . Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel :) Everything was very upscale and they even let you check out directly from your room by using the TV or texting to a certain number. It's very easy and efficient so you don't have to waste any time in line downstairs. Also, the self-parking is far away from the front desk, so I would definitely suggest you to check out directly from the room. Makes your life so much easier! Another great thing about this hotel was the "tablet" that they have in the room which can control the temperature, curtains, call for room service, and change lighting. The tablet itself wasn't in the best condition and some words were cut off but it still worked! I love using it in the morning to open the curtains and get some light through the room :). . Aside from the room itself, when you want to get through the elevators to your room, you'll have to show the security your room card to validate that you are a PAYING CUSTOMER, so not just anyone can go up to the rooms, which I think is pretty nice!
Oh Aria... . . I had suchhigh expectations for you and was somewhat disappointed. You made me wait for over an hour to check in to my room on a weekday which was a bad start. . . Am I stupid or was it hard to figure out how to use the remote control for lighting, curtains, TV, radio etc? Had some trouble figuring it out and the buttons on my controller was really hard to push. Got frustrated and went to the pool and that was underwhelming and not super well maintained. Overall color me unimpressed. . . There were some pluses. My room was clean, the bathroom was awesome and I liked the city view, but most of all I choose you because of Zarkana which was the highly of my stay. You got me this time, but not again!
Love this place but watch your credit card. They always over charge the deposit and had to call front desk. Don't panic. Take a deep breath and settle with the front desk people. . I always pay $200 cash deposit now so I don't have to deal with the headache.. Wifi is decent.
....Sorry the offensive smoke in the casino intolerable...is there something wrong with your ventilation system....and that damned computerized everything in the room....I know you wish you didn't have it, but it's too late, you'r stuck with it....when I pushed the wrong button all the lights in the unit went out...including in the bathroom where my wife was just getting out of the bathtub...that iced it for me...checked out...
Aria is my home away from home.  I frequent this hotel on numerous occasions throughout the year.. Besides the many dining options, the spa is a place I typically go to spend the day in complete bliss.. Having Crystals right next door is equally amazing... . . The beds are COOOOOOOMFY.. Steak and Eggs via In Room Dining was absolutely superb. The Sky Suites utilize Khiels for their toiletries, which is quite nice.  Especially the moisturizer in this dry heat.. . Everyone is so helpful, and pleasant.. . . I am not the self proclaimed "aria Princess" for nothing!!. . It's like Aladdin, and his genie in the bottle.. What ever I want or need, gets done in great time . . Luxury at it's finest...without feeling pretentious.. . Have I mentioned how much I LOVE this place?
Although I have had billing issues on more than one occasion, I'm still giving this place 5 stars.. . First, the billing situation.  The first time it happened, they overcharged my credit card $150 for incidentals. Although it didn't affect my bank account, for some this could have been a real problem and it was a hassle to get it removed.  Luckily, they gave me a free night that I was able to use Memorial Day Weekend. The second time, they overcharged us for the mini-bar. $50 this time. They were apologetic and had it removed.  Aside from these two instances, my experiences at Aria have been flawless.. . First of all, the hotel itself is a modern masterpiece. The architecture is breathtaking and the hotel is littered with beautiful art pieces.  Check-in always seems to be long, but being in a lobby that sexy is never a bad thing.  Employees are somewhat robotic, as they have to be when reciting AAA Five Diamond lingo.... That's ok though. Makes you feel important.  Since I'm a Gold MLife member, I always get an upgraded city view room, maybe one day they will hook me up with a suite. They are pretty strict on upgrades and always want to charge you.  The trek from the lobby to room is kinda far... I always seem to play a few slot machines on the way up to the room!  . . As you walk by the casino you see Jean Philippe right before you hit the elevator bank.... YOU MUST HAVE PASTRIES/COFFEE/DESSERT here (see my review for Jean Philippe).. . Elevator banks are watched 24/7 by security.... Makes you feel safe. Elevators whisk you up and before you know it, you're on the top floor. Hallways are long, so if you are lazy, ask for a room near an elevator. I had the pleasure of walking to the end of the hallway.... swipe card near door.... ENTER. HEAVEN.. . As soon as you enter, the blinds magically open. So cool.  The room is not as big as Encore, Wynn, Venetian or Palazzo but the room itself and the overall experience is what makes this place truly special.  The beds are THE BEST beds you will ever sleep in.... Like you're sleeping on cloud 9.  The room is controlled by a master screen next to the bed and when you're ready for bed, click the GOODNIGHT button and everything turns off and the shades close. Perfect for lazy people.  Don't accidentally push this button while you're mom is in the bathroom though! HAHA! Made for a good laugh.. . Bathroom is on the smallish side but the way it's laid makes it work to its advantage. The shower is separate from the bathtub, but you have to walk into the shower to get to the bathtub.... It's kinda claustrophobic but kinda awesome at the same time.  The room has upscale mini-bar amenities at upscale prices (LOL) and the desk functionality is perfect for business travelers.  Wi-Fi is average at best, but THE LAS VEGAS STRIP has the worst internet, EVER.. . The pool, gym facilities are the best in town and there are a lot of great places to eat.  Five50 Pizza is a great place to get pizza on the go.... The Cafe is open late and has delicious food, kinda pricy, but good at the same time.  I haven't been to the buffet but it always looks empty.... Hmmm, have to try that place out sometime...... . Soooo, verdict is that this is one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas..... I enjoy myself every time I stay here and service is superb.  Prices for Aria are on the expensive side, but I always get discounted room rates at $79 and that usually comes with $100 resort credit.  Don't forget the $25 a night resort fee on top of that.  It's all worth it in the end, and if your'e looking to have a memorable Vegas experience, Aria is a sure bet.
Very fancy. Smells lovely and you can buy the scent-sticks at the gift store.. Extremely crowded. Always.
This review is on their customer service, specifically towards concierge and security-lost and found.. . I had left my ipad charger and realized it shortly after I checked out.. I went back to the hotel and the concierge had confirmed with me that housekeeping retrieved it but it will take couple hours to get it to lost and found.. I had to leave Vegas so she took down my number and told me security will contact me and it will be mailed to me, free of charge.. . After not hearing back from them for a week, I called and now the security tells me nothing was retrieved from the room. but I was specifically told that it had been before. He told me a person will be contacting me to start an inquiry/investigation on it on that day.. . Of course not to my surprise, I dont hear from them so I call back again 3 days later and now the lady in security is telling me she does not know of such procedure of starting investigation and maybe i should try calling back to speak to that guy again..... . please get your act together Aria in your service area. . Its not about the charger. it's about being told one thing and then another the next. and then no follow up. and it's a shame because your rooms and casinos are nice. especially for the price.
I'm very impressed with this hotel. I stayed here during spring break and even though it was crowded, the service was awesome! When walking to check in, we were greeted and were personally shown to the desk. Everyone was very nice and accommodated to my request to have a room on a high floor. When we got to our room, I was amazed at the view. Unfortunately, the Aria is set back from the strip a little bit, but we had an awesome view of the city and the lights at night were beautiful. . The room was small, but had great extras such as a huge bathroom and blackout curtains. . . We also spent one day of our trip just relaxing, going to the spa and the gym. We did not buy any spa treatments, but just the day pass, which was great in itself. I think i spent a good hour lying down in the warm stone beds. . . I was a little disappointed with the pools though. There were about three ( I might be wrong) but they were kind of all the same. Just a round pool. . . It seems like this hotel is catered to the more mature crowd and for people on conventions. We met people who were there for a pizza convention! With that said, I would love to stay at this hotel again.
My first stay at the aria was this past weekend. Everyone was extremely friendly,the customer service was excellent, probably the best I've ever had at any hotel. The room was amazing, the bed was super comfortable and bathroom was exquisite. Every piece of food I ate was delicious and every drink I drank was amazing. The gym was great, they have plenty of free weights and Dumbbells that went to 100lbs. One huge plus for me was the free wifi, whereas other hotels make you pay $15/day for wifi. I can't wait to go back, I highly recommend staying at the aria.
the first time i went to Aria, i have a great feeling as i walk into the room, it is not too exaggerating so i can actually feel relax there. i love that their staff is really friendly and boy i love their complementary chocolate they put on the bed.  what i like about this hotel is that they show appreciation to their customer and i can actually feel that they wants to provide the best service to me.  I appreciate their attitude and will definately go back there again; why not, great room, reasonable price, but best service.
Visited this hotel yesterday. Although.  It was very clean it wasn't welcoming. It had two floors of stores, but no where to get a cocktail to go. The tram stopped right at the hotel which made it convenient. . In the "mall" there was a cool display using water and clear cylinders to create water tornadoes. However a few feet further there was another display that feature two very large white swans that lit up with clear lights. Seemed very holiday to me. As we walked out there was a display of giant icicles. They were real. As they melt it created this water pool that spills over. That was impressive. How do they make those?
This was my first visit to Aria, and I enjoyed the stay very much.  The hotel and casino was extremely clean and finding assistance when needed, was easy to find.  It felt crowded for a mid-week stay, but I think it speaks to this hotel being better then most.  . We stayed in a city view regular room.  I found the bathroom counter space limited, and the shower floor extremely slippery, I recommend putting down a towel so you don't fall.  . We ate in the Aria Cafe and ordered shortly after being seated.  After about ten to fifteen minutes, the waitress had to re-ask my companion what he had ordered, claiming the "ticket got stuck"?  I think she may have forgotten to enter it and then couldn't remember what it was he ordered, as ordering done electronically probably doesn't involve "tickets".  . I would certainly recommend others stay at this hotel, and would definitely stay again myself.
We were here for couple of days and it was fun. They granted our request for an early check in cause we have a 2 yr old with us. And also gave us a free fridge!!Everything was going fine til we went to eat at the buffet. First there was only one open register for a very long  line of waiting customers who are for sure are hungry. Then when we get to the register there was this not so friendly cahier didn't even smile no greetings no hi or hello nothing...so i was like ok fine whatever maybe he is having a bad day, after that we joined the long line again before we were seated..there was this lady i think one of the hostesses that was there again no hi or hello just asked us how many then she asked the people behind us and said ok follow me..so we followed her she pointed a table for us but my hubby asked for a corner table and the lady just gave us an attitude and keep insisting it was the best corner table that is open (we wanted a corner table for we have a 2 yr old and we don't want to make any inconvenience to other people)..so she didn't even made any effort to comply with our small doable request and then left us hanging. Me being so hungry and getting angry already decided to just get up and go get food. After few minutes same lady came with customer and that customer asked for a corner table and she didn't even hesitated she gave that customer the corner table we wanted!!!i was like ok let it go..now as we are eating..our waitress is cool but there was this guy keeps on talking to her about their schedule how it is messed up and starting to curse saying "this is BS" and he went on and on all i can hear is him complaining and keep saying "this is BS" i can hear them cause they were on the table next to ours...so for that experience i only give this hotel 3 star..hopefully they can train their employees especially the ones in the buffet better customer service. But we didn't let that incident ruin our vacay..
Salvador the awesome dealer! Just what I would expect from Aria!  Very friendly staff oh and the chick working the zarkana wheel  you're cool talking smack about all dem hookers just outside!  Sure made my vacation worth it!  I had doubts about being placed on the 54th floor but the elevators were smooth and quick!  Great service , nice rooms, and friendly staff!
