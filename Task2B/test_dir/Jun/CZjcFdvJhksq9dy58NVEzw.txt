I thought the buffet was ok, nothing spectacular.  For the cost, I expected a bigger selection.. . They only had 4 pasta dishes which all tasted the same, bland and overcooked.. . The meat station had only 3 different carving stations which were a little dry and unseasoned.. . I am not a seafood eater but that station seemed to have a nice selection and the the lines were long which told me it must have been pretty good.. . The sushi and dessert stations were the best and had the most variety.. . It was worth trying it out but I doubt I would return.
Probably 3.5 stars, but I decided to round up because the nice desserts made me happy. It is the epitome of Las Vegas buffets in that it offers pretty much offers any type of quality cuisine your appetite can possibly desire. A well-priced buffet given how good the food is...for a buffet. Some items are better than others -- I personally enjoyed the prime rib and sea bass (no surprise there). Save room for dessert -- they really have a fine selection of pastries and cakes.
Just okay.  Not great.  Nothing really special.  And it makes me sad.....as i remember a time when it was a lot better.  "Ooohh you went to the Bellagio buffet??  Nice."  Won't be saying that anymore.  Perhaps it's because we came mid-week?. . The Good:  . . Ahi Poke and Sushi. Caesar salad (but c'mon, who messes that up). Desserts. Grilled veggies. Prime Rib. Salmon mousse thingies. Creamed spinach. . There was plenty of crab and shrimp.  But the crab is clearly frozen.  And maybe that's just how it has to be now, I don't know.  It's still good.  . . Wish it would have been yummier.  The $11.99 unlimited drinks is totally worth it if you plan to have more than one.
Buffets are generally not that good.... the food is mass produced and generally just isn't super tasty. This buffet is no exception... it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I would say the best items were the ribs, the mashed potatoes, and the sliders... all fairly decent. The asian selections were all not very good. The desserts weren't anything special either. . . . PS I had my buffet was free from using MyVegas, so I can't complain about that!
We'll I can say that the hype is true about this place. By far, the best buffet I've ever been to. Very wide ranging selection of food for the likes of everyone. Food was delicious, but not exemplary. However, just being able to say that about a buffet is a major win in my opinion.. . The line to get in is split between reservations and non reservations. I came at an off peak time so I got right in. It's also not very expensive when compared to the amount of food you have access to. There's also plenty of tables and bar areas to grab a seat as the place is very big.. . I had everything from vegetable stir fry to penne vodka and it was delicious. Food lines moved very quickly and your drink was always refilled in an acceptable amount of time. They have a pretty impressive dessert section as well.. . All in all, this place was awesome. A definite must in Vegas.
I've lived in Vegas nearly my entire life and probably have been to every single buffet in this city.  From gourmet buffets to your average station casino, on top of my parents being such avid gamblers, there isn't a casino buffet I'm not familiar with until this place.. . Front: We came here close to 6pm on a saturday just before the rush of people wanting to get dinner and thankfully we planned it this way.  The wait in line probably only took 10 minutes and was prompted a place to sit (party of 4) immediately while a bigger group in front of us had to wait. . . Price:. Breakfast: $18.99 (Mon-Fri/ 7am-11am. Lunch: $22.99 (11am-330pm). Dinner: $33.99 (Mon-Thur 330-1000). Gourmet dinner: $39.99 (Fri-Sat/330-1000). . Food:. Now like all buffets in Vegas, they love to prepare dishes from around the world.  This place was no different as they feature primarily Asian, American, Italian and Mexican. The food here ladies and gentlemen probably the best buffet food i've had (yes, better than the M and better than GVR's feast).  They had chicken tikka masala that was pretty consistent in terms of flavor and was nicely tender.  They had pesto mashed potatoes and pesto shrimp pizza, both of which were perfect.  They feature snow crabs like any other buffet but also offer king crab (only drawback is that you can't get them steamed, they're all served cold.) A sushi bar next to the crabs that serve your basic rolls and nigiri, tuna/salmon poke (with spicy mayo on the side) and they serve american caviar, other eggs and steak tartar (GET THE TARTAR!!!).  Rack of lamb was also served which was prepared wonderfully without too much of that lamby/gamey taste.. . Dessert: . The blueberry, strawberry and chocolate raspberry macaron.  I strongly recommend getting this to end your experience.  Its just a nice touch of sweetness without being too overpowered in terms of richness to clean  your palette alongside the refreshing feeling of the fruits. . . Interior: This buffet is very intimate, meaning that its walkways in the buffet are narrow and you'll be bumping into plenty of people.  Decor is dated but the food makes up for that.  There is a bathroom located inside the buffet so no more having to leave and asking the cocktail waitresses where the bathrooms are; however, the mens room has like 2 urinals and 1 stall so you'll probably end up pooping elsewhere. . . Overall: . This buffet is probably the best buffet i've had.  GVR used to rank supreme when they would marinate the crabs and shrimp in that special blend of spices and herbs but they have since eliminated that.  A bit on the pricier side as we went during the gourmet buffet but with your choices of rack of lamb, king crab, steak tartar and other premium food choices (plus being on the strip) the price is reasonable. If the crabs were steamed and the walkways were more wider, I would definitely give this place a 5.
After going to the Bachannal Buffet at Caesars this was kind of a let down. My kids felt the same way. I didn't like that their "kids price" only applied to 4 and under. Really? My daughters weren't the ones carting off trays of oysters and crab legs like it was time to stockpile bc the Zombie Apocalypse was coming. We had like maybe 8 legs between the four of us? They do steam them on request if you prefer heated. Every fish dish I tried was overcooked. The decor looked dated and I felt like I was in a hospital cafeteria. Good desserts though.
this is one of my favorite buffets I've every been too. price wasn't bad at all for Vegas. they have a wide variety of foods to choose from and it was all amazing.
On Sunday, 6/15/14, my girlfriend and I decided to hit up The Buffet at Bellagio for Father's Day brunch. I watched a segment on TV a few years ago about the buffet at the Bellagio. It's supposed to be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. I couldn't wait to indulge on all the different foods!. . Atmosphere/Decor:. . The Buffet at Bellagio kind of reminded me of an upscale Hometown Buffet. You would think that the atmosphere and decor would be extravagant since it's located in the Bellagio but it wasn't. The concept and set up of the buffet seemed to go hand and hand. I liked how each food station was specifically focused on a certain cuisine. For example, there was an Asian Food section with nothing but Asian foods. There was also an Italian section, Seafood section, Contemporary American section and of course a dessert section. The setup was very straight forward. I found it very easy to find foods that I liked. The interior design was just mediocre but then again it's a buffet and not an upscale restaurant so what do you expect. The one issue I had with the set up was the restroom. When I went to go use the the restroom I noticedthere was only one restroom stall. Everyone knows for a fact that when you are eating at a buffet there are going to be tons of people that will experience bubble guts and will have to drop a super serious deuce in the bathroom. Having only one bathroom stall isn't going to cut it. We ended up sitting at the bar which was pretty nice. . . Food: . . Where do I start. There was a ton of food to choose from. I started out with a Caesar salad, a few pieces of watermelon and fresh sliced cured meats. The Caesar salad was decent. It was kind of soggy but it still tasted pretty good. The watermelon was fresh and tasted good. The cured meats were excellent especially the roasted pork. The roasted pork had so much flavor! For round two, I decided to go with a romaine salad, topped with cheddar cheese, carrots, and ranch dressing. I also got two pieces of pepperoni pizza. For my other plate, I got roasted turkey with turkey gravy, ham, and country potatoes with white gravy. The salad with ranch dressing was excellent. I loved the taste of their ranch dressing. I'm assuming it was made from scratch. The pepperoni pizza was  also very good. The roasted turkey was one of my favorites. I love turkey! The turkey reminded me of a good cooked Thanksgiving Turkey. The turkey was delicious. The turkey gravy had a nice consistency to it and complimented the roasted turkey very well. The ham was very good too. I liked the country potatoes a lot! They had a very nice country flavor to them and the white gravy enhanced the flavor of the potatoes even more. For round three, I decided to eat another romaine salad with ranch dressing, roasted turkey with turkey gravy, beef tenderloins with a pepper corn reduction sauce, mashed potatoes, pureed yams and prime rib. The beef tenderloins were super tender and loaded with flavor. The pepper corn sauce was strong but the meat was cooked perfectly so it didn't matter. The mashed potatoes were spot on perfect! There was nothing wrong with them. They were definitely one of the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten and reminded me of how my girlfriends mashed potatoes taste. The pureed yams were silky smooth and sweet. The prime rib was sensational! The meat was cooked perfect to a medium rare and had so so so much flavor. There was a perfect meat to fat ratio. The prime rib was probably my favorite and the highlight of the buffet. For round four, I decided to eat another slice of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn beef and hash, pineapple fried rice and a teriyaki chicken skewer. The corn beef and hash was okay. I'm used to the corn beef from a can. The meat and potatoes were shredded. The pineapple fried rice and teriyaki chicken skewer was really good. I liked the fried rice because it had chunks of pineapple in it. Pineapple is my favorite fruit and I love fried rice! The chicken skewer was very tender and the teriyaki sauce had a nice sweet flavor. For round five, I decided to go with another slice of prime rib, teriyaki chicken skewer, bowl of jasmine white rice and some more mashed potatoes. Everything tasted great! For my final round, I got a few slices of watermelon and fresh strawberries. . . Service: . . My girlfriend and I thought the service was great. She ordered the unlimited bloody marys and every time she finished one, the bartender promptly made her a new one. Our waters were always topped off without us even asking for a refill. The two gentlemen working at the bar were very polite and personable. . . Overall: . . The Buffet at Bellagio is great! The food was excellent! The buffet line can get pretty long and the wait could exceed over an hour. I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar so you can avoid waiting for over an hour. I know there are many buffets in Vegas, but you will definitely get the best bang for your buck at Bellagio!
For $25 a person .... this was worth it! I wouldn't say it's the BEST buffet ever, but they have a huge selection and some stuff was really good!. . I was also able to skip the line & get my free buffet from playing "My Vegas Slots"! woot wooooot. So I got 2 free buffets from playing the game lol. I had to get my M Life card from the desk but it was good! We got to skip the whole wait, which was amazing cause we really didn't have much time to wait around. . . They have really nice waiters / waitresses and they're very attentive. Even though we sat in the far corner, we still got their attention every 20 mins. Plus, there was also a huge selection to choose from. I really wanted to eat their pancakes, french toast and waffles but apparently they change it out around 12pm for lunch items! But omg, their spicy tuna hand roll was AMAZING. They have it laid out but you have to ask the lady to grab it for you, so don't be shy! I didn't know I can ask at first until I saw someone else had it on their plate haha! . . But they had an omelette station, and it was gooood. You can even ask for some salsa to top it off :) They also had eggs benedict but I really couldn't even eat that after the omelette ... sigh. But I would definitely come back here for brunch! Affordable & fulfilling! :) Thanks, Bellagio!
Service was incredible (Alfonso was our server) and the overall food quality was good. Sushi selection was quite disappointing--especially when you are paying around $35 a person for dinner (even the kids). The kids weren't impressed with the selections offered and subsequently didn't eat too much--including the desserts offered.
Was there with the family and had dining credit to use. The restaurants in Bellagio where I could use the credits were too nice but I could use the credit at the buffet so we had dinner there and breakfast the next day. Dinner is $35 and breakfast $19. Breakfast is a much better deal. All the standard stuff egg, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles. Did not want to wait in line for omelet. Some nice things like eggs benedict that were very good. They also have a decent choice of chinese breakfast items such a rice porridge, steamed pork buns. Dessert at breakfast and dinner are identical but there are a lot of desserts  and all the desserts are very good so whatever I did not try at dinner I had at breakfast and then some.  For dinner you have prime rib that was very good and for me the best item. There is what they call Kobe top round roast that was tough and you should avoid. The selection at dinner covers pretty much everything. For the crab legs they are cold but you can give a plate of crab legs to the person behind the counter and they will heat it up. Not sure how they do it but I suspect they just microwave it. Wife like the crab legs but for me they are just too much work to eat. Kids were happy as the had mac and cheese is small ramekins, pizza and ribs and of course the desserts. For both dinner and breakfast we waited about 20 minutes to get in. We were there midweek and had dinner around 6:00 pm and breakfast around 10:00 am. One other thing they have very good coffee.
Had lunch there today. Line was longer than I have seen in about five years. A twenty minute wait, but everything was top notch, as usual. Four of us were $100 before a tip.
Brunch is way over priced for what it is
Went to the breakfast buffet, one morning during my trip to Vegas and I loved it!. . I was expecting just breakfast items, but they had breakfast, normal dinner/lunch options, and dessert! Nothing better than finishing a breakfast with chocolate cake and soft serve ice cream. . . I went very hungry so I feel like I got great value for the $32 price. Others around me did not seem to come prepared aka they only got one plate. If you are going to a Buffet, you better go hungry. These people may have come to the buffet hungover, but that is their fault and that is a stupid idea. . . I ate an unhealthy amount of bacon, but it was too good to pass up. Eggs Benedict was really good. . . I would suggest that you go to this buffet when you are in Vegas for breakfast as long as you can eat a good amount of food in the morning. My friends and I skipped lunch after this buffet.. . Also, general rule of thumb: two buffets in one day = too much. We went to Caesar's Buffet at night the same day and I am not sure I got the same value out of it as I did here.
Out of the several Vegas buffets I tried during a week here, they had the best food. Don't let the looks of the place and food fool you. Although other buffets have better looking spaces and food, your taste buds will not lie.. . The food was slightly better here than at Caesar's Palace even though the Bellagio was cheaper. And the Bellagio food was also better than some other places priced about the same.
As many people have previously mentioned, there needs to be half stars because I would probably rate this as a 3.5. . . My aunt really wanted to visit this buffet because it had been highly recommended by a friend of hers. We arrived at buffet at around 8p.m. and there was quite a line to get in. We were told that it was going to be at least an hour wait. We joined the line and settled in for the wait. . Long story short, an hour and 15 minutes later, after dealing with a woman behind us who kept complaining about how hungry she was and how long it was taking for us to get in, large groups of people coming into the Invited guest line which ended with us having to wait at the beginning of our line for an additional 15 minutes, and then having to wait to be seated once we had paid, we were finally seated.. Because it was already after 9 and the buffet closed at 10, I was concerned that there wasn't going to be very much of a selection of food. The selection wasn't bad, but unless you're a seafood fan or like Italian, there really wasn't much of a selection. Many of the other dishes looked picked over and only had maybe a serving or two left. I had been hearing good things about the desserts but when I finally made it through the crowd to there, it looked like there was virtually nothing. The few different desserts that were still there had a lot of each of them, but there were maybe 5 or 6 different choices. . I understand that we had gone late and they were going to be closing in less than an hour, but I was a little disappointed. The food was good, but I had expected more from the selection. . The highlight of our visit, and the reason that I ended up going up half a star and rating it a 4 instead of a 3 was our server Julie. She brought our drinks quicklyand refilled without us having to ask. She also cleared the empty dishes and brought us new utensils quickly and efficiently. We had excellent service from her and it was much appreciated after a long day. . . I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon. If I do, it would have to be earlier in the day because I don't know if the dinner buffet is worth the $33+ and the wait in line. It was an okay buffet, though, and if you're in the area, have the time and the money to spend, then I'd say go for it. Just don't go after 8p.m.
Can't really go wrong with their buffet here.  The selection is huge and the service is excellent.  I would like to point out that our server always kept our drinks from being empty and when it came to taking your plates and getting you napkins or wet clothes, they did an amazing job.  . . Lots of people complain about the line up, this is the same case for most buffets since most guests or tourists go for the buffets.  As a matter of fact, if you are one of their MLIFE member and move up a tier (which is pretty much booking a few nights) you get to go through the VIP line up and skip the line... It came in handy for me as I just arrived to the room and was extremely hungry.  I just went though my VIP line and straight in.  I felt a bit douchey but hey, that's how their rewards program work and I'm just making use of it.
