Love this place at all times of the day I'm currently in here annoyed with this amber chick smacking her gum while she's at the register
Great sandwich, avoid the iced tea. Crazy crowded at lunch but line moved fairly quickly. Worth the wait.
Cheap, incredibly tasty, lunch option.. u won't find stuff this cheap on the strip.. . from the PH poker room you can order from here and have it delivered. but note: they wont' take poker chips, u have to use cash.. . i had the italian sandwich.. it's simple but it's delicioius... . the only problem - i walked by there at least 10 times since i stayed at PH this time. i would say minimum 15-20 ppl waiting in line.. maximum 40 or so ppl in line. which is just NUTS.
Everyone says that the Earl of Sandwich in Vegas "tastes waaaay better" than the one in Downtown Disney so I made sure to stop by here to try it out for myself.. . ...I would like to argue that the sandwiches tasted exactly the same to me! It probably just tastes better to everyone else because it's Vegas & they're probably eating this when they're drunk. Everything tastes better when you're drunk.. . I ate here when I was sober. Still loved it though! My go-to sandwiches are the chipotle chicken & the Earl's club.. . They're open 24 hours so I'll be back when I'm in Vegas after a night of drinking & maybe the sandwiches will taste even better than they already do.
I've heard a lot about this place so I was super excited to come here at 5 AM when I just wanted to knock out. There was still a long line but my friend and I already walked here so we had to go through with ordering the sandwiches before our stomachs ate themselves out. . . I ordered the pastrami rueben. When it came out, I was sad that it looked so small but I liked the presentation of how it was wrapped in gold paper. I killed the sandwich in 5 minutes...I was that hungry. I definitely really liked the thousand island sauce with it. After that, I just knocked out. But I definitely think that it's really good. At first I didn't like that it was so small but then I realized that I never finish a full sandwich anyway so it was a good amount that didn't make me feel too bloated but satisfied me just enough. The bread was soft and there was good flavors. I do wish that they had a bigger selection on the menu though but I think I would come back if I needed that morning food kick. Oh and the food came out much faster than I expected which was nice because I just wanted to go back to the hotel to sleep.
We love this place!  Wish there were more of these franchises near by.  It's great for an inexpensive lunch in the very pricey strip.  My fav is the Earl sandwich and my hubby's fav is the Italian.
I almost don't want to write a review for Earl's because they are already so damn popular I don't feel the need to express my love for this restaurant. However on my most recent trip to Vegas I stayed at PH so I had very easy access to Earl's. I literally ate it all weekend. Everyone raves about the chipotle chicken, which is the best. They also have a selection of soups and I really loved the chicken tortilla! The clam chowder was tooooo watery. They also have a selection of sides; I was debating between trying the parfait and potato salad.. I mean you really can't go wrong with either and now I wish I just got both but at the time their parfait hit the spot as I took it to go and ate it while walking around the strip! Earl of Sandwich is a MUST while in Vegas especially if you're tryna eat on a budget :). Now my only wish is that they would open up more locations! I have yet to visit the one in downtown Disney... But soon.
A trip to PH would be incomplete without a stop at this amazing sandwich place.. . Don't let the line intimidate you though.. It moves quickly.. . The prices are Vegas-affordable. $7-ish to $8-ish for a sandwich.. I say it's worth it rather than spending on an junk food chain.. . My ultimate faves are the:. . *Full Montagu -Roasted beef and turkey, swish and cheddar cheesem tomato and mustard sauce. ---i mean.. it sounds so freaking simple but trust me.. They have this touch. Their bread is pressed perfectly and the meats are great.. no after taste whatsoever. It's Bomb.. . *The Italian - Another simple staple known at every sandwich place.. I tried this last time coz i told myself I have to get something else other than the Full Montagu or the Reuben... I liked it.... Yummmmmy. . *Reuben - ooooh i just love patrami and saurkraut.. . *Chicken Tortilla Soup - i have no idea why we got this on a perfectly hot day; but it felt great. total hangover cure.. . *Chocolate Brownie: Eh. Mine is better. I like how it's not too sweet. But i wish it were more moist. I swear their pastries toward the cashier are flirts. . . I overheard this one chick behind us at the line speaking highly of their Pasta Salad.. Too bad they didn't have it when we were there.... . But i've tried their Potato Salad in the past even if i hate mayo coated things; and it was pretty good..... . *and yo..if you ever eat here.. please don't come soaking wet in your bikini unless you're like supermodel hot. (meaning.. no hanging tits and butt cheeks where other people may sit-- supermodel=classy OK?). Tacky.. . HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
I really like their sandwiches and potato  salad. YUMMY. I am craving this:)
Perfect size, perfect sandwich, what else is there to say? . . The boy and I ordered 2 hot sandwiches, and the way they toast their bread and melt the cheese to keep all the components together is just brilliant. . . Definitely going to have to make a trip back some time. . . Oh, and the clam chowder was pretty good too.
This place is Meh! The sandwiches are barely filled with ingredients; there are better places off the strip. If you're using yelp, then yelp another sandwich shop. This place is full of tourism.
Regardless of your luck at the slots or the club last night, just know that when you go all in at the Earl of Sandwich, you're guaranteed to hit the jackpot. . . *heavy breathing* http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/641/298/448.jpg. . Sorry, I was just thinking about the Full Montagu I had before saying "Bye Felicia" to Vegas. Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce all over that puppy. Wrapped up in a foil sheet and piping hot, this baby-sized sammie was ready to be devoured. . . Now I know this place is not known for its organic hormone-free free-range glutenless vegan delicacies. No. Nope. Nope. Nope. But what the Earl of Sandwich will do IS absolve any problems that seem to leave you hanging. Their gut-bomb.com sandwiches are just what Dr. Vegas ordered for your sorry ass for having that last $30 drank at Hakkasan. . . The line moves fast, which is just a GOD SEND in this town. A glimpse of luck if you will. Regardless of what you order from their large selection of sandwiches, salads, soups, or sides it's probably going to be damn delicious and ready for you within a few minutes of paying. . . Did you know that this chain was started by 11th Earl of Sandwich, John Montagu, to pay homage to the 4th Earl of Sandwich, who is of course the inventor of this glorious culinary combo. That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas. . . Anyways, the rating speaks for itself and I'm glad my mom and I listened in. We won this one fo sho!
For both the Las Vegas Strip location and Downtown Disney, Earl's is one of the best and satisfying "quick snacks". During an afternoon of belligerent drinking or after a night of partying, grabbing a sandwich from here isn't a bad choice if you don't feel like having a $5 pizza. . . All the sandwiches I've tried have been pretty consistent: not bad, but nothing special. The two I particularly enjoy are the Tuna and Holiday Turkey. I'm pretty picky about my tuna and this place rounds up a pretty decent melt.. chunky bites of tuna on their crispy Artisan bread, too good.. The holiday turkey is probably one of my favorite sandwiches ever. I love all the ingredients that make up the sandwich: turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry! Thanksgiving in a sandwich. Yummm! . . Earl's also offer plenty of other snacks: wraps, soups, salads, chips, drinks, etc.. but all you really need is a sandwich and a complimentary cocktail from the casino, and you're all good!. . This location is always busy, usually backed up with a line. I think it's definitely worth it though if you're hungry and looking for a cheap choice.
This place is always there when everything else is too far or too expensive.. . I live in California and there is a huge difference between the quality of this earls and the earls in down town disney.. . . I definitely love this one better.
OMG..every time I come to Vegas I have to eat this. Plus, it's open 24/7. AND they deliver to you if you're playing Poker at Planet Hollywood.. . I love their chicken chipotle sandwich.  The sandwiches look small, but they def fill you up.  You can also refill your fountain drinks.  Not a bad deal.
Seems like we visit this place each time we are in Las Vegas. Good choices, including a number of gluten free items. The checkout staff could be faster - which leads to longer lines than need be. It's also noisy being adjacent to the casino and shops nearby, but you're there for the food, not the atmosphere.
We ordered the chipotle chicken  avocado. The bread and everything in the sandwich we great except the processed chicken pieces with fake grill marks.  This place had horrible service from the person who takes your order all the way to the manager who throws your food on the counter. We had a broken food buzzer so our just sat there and even though i told the manager is was broken and probably needed batteries he just placed back with all the others and left the counter. Save your time and money, there are  plenty of better places to eat at when in Vegas.
Not into it.  In the mall in Planet Hollywood.  Order at the counter and you are given a pager.  There is bad music blasting from the mall which you are still in.  The food was okay.  I'm surprised this place has gotten such good reviews.
Good, but over-rated. . . One drunken night in Vegas I accidentally took someone else's order, lol. All I remember was it had chicken, lettuce, more condiments, and strawberry jam in it. Whatever that sandwich was it was a hell of a lot better than the ones I ordered. I seriously ate Earls for breakfast, lunch, and dinner when I stayed and PH and got so sick of it by the end of the trip.
Pretty good sandwiches.  Price a little on the high side but still decent.
yum-OOOOooo! I've been a few times. one of the only sandwiches that my dogs literally watch me eat hoping that i'll drop it and they'll devour it. I've only tried one sandwich. It has cranberry sauce on it and it's heaven. make sure they really toast it as the sogginess from the sauces can kill your "Earl" buzz.
Loved Earl of Sandwich! The portions are filling, and the prices are adequate especially for being situated in the middle of the Planet Hollywood casino. I wish that they gave you water cups that were bigger than about 4oz. Since Vegas is so hot all the time, I got up to get more water 3-4 times within our 15 minute lunch. Overall, the Earl of Sandwich is great!
Quality seems okay,  but my chicken bacon avocado came with no avocado and my wife's caprese came with no basil. . . Better options available all around.
I'm not happy with the service I received here at all. I ordered a BBQ salad with the chicken on the side because they couldn't make a veggie wrap instead of the sandwich. I also had a sandwich for my bf which came the first time my buzzer went off but no salad. That's when I noticed that the little boy who took our order rang up a Thai salad, not that it mattered because it wasn't with the order anyway. I wait patiently for the kid who threw my order at me to come back to tell him I also ordered a salad and that I wanted the BBQ chicken not the Thai like it said on the receipt. Lol and behold several minutes later what do I get? A Thai chicken salad with the chicken on the side. I ate it only because I was starving and it was below mediocre and so small! I'm definitely not happy with their service especially with the long wait time. Never coming back.
This was my first time and the sandwich was very good. I will eat here again and try something new. The environment was loud, crowded and not too comfortable, but I guess that's what you get when you eat in a popular spot crammed into a corner of a shopping area and casino.
Perfect after a long night of drinking or to prep your stomach for a long night of drinking. I always stop here before/after, whenever I'm at the Palms. Sandwiches are legit and consistent. . . Service is used to drunk tourists, and even when there's a line, it's worth sticking around for a really good sandwich.
I was in Las Vegas for about five days and I'm pretty sure my friends and I ate there at least four times. The sandwiches are delicious, the salads are very tasty as well, and the macaroni and cheese was bomb dot com. The only thing that would make me give them five stars is better customer service. None of the workers looked happy to be working there and coming from someone that also works at a busy restaurant, seeing a smile always makes the guest's experience better.. Definitely plan on eating here again the next time I'm back in Vegas!
Earl of Sandwich is a touristy place with average tasting sandwiches. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich without the bacon. The sandwich was poorly made and all of the ingredients in it were sub par. Romaine lettuce wilted and the cheddar cheese tasted like plastic. Bread was fine but the grill or panini maker they make it on needs to be cleaned more thoroughly because it had that dirty type of grill taste. Not impressed and this is why I rarely eat in casinos.
Definitely a must when visiting Vegas! You really can't go wrong with Earl. It's cheap ($6-7 for any sandwich), open 24/7, and there are lots of options to choose from. My favorites are the holiday turkey (it's Thanksgiving in a sandwich!) and the Original 1762.. . The bread makes all the difference! It is perfectly toasted. At the other Earl locations, you can choose from white or wheat bread, but at the Vegas location, they only have white available (probably to speed up the ordering process since lines can get long).. . As many others have said, it's perfect for lunch, after a drunken night out, or a quick snack. If you're especially hungry, you might want to order two. The lines can get a little long sometimes, but it's totally worth it.
Earl of sandwich an ok decent sandwich not super great not terrible. Decent and edible.
Was in Vegas for a buddy's bachelor party and after a long night of drinking/strip club hopping ;-) and gambling,  we found ourselves at Planet Hollywood.  It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).
Let's face reality...there's not many options for food on the Strip that's extremely exceptional and tasty and UNDER $10.... . SAY HELLO to EARLS!. . One of the reasons I stay at Planet Hollywood is that I love having access to a warm, filling, and delicious Earl's Sandwich 24 hours a day...This place is always busy and for good reason. Sandwiches run about $6-$7 and even with a side and a drink, you'll be a little over $10. . . Each sandwich is toasted and made to order, so it always comes out nice and warm.  Everybody has their own favorite and mine is the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. BBQ Chicken, pineapple, and ham is the best! However, the Chipotle Chicken, Tuna Melt, Roast Beef, Pastrami sandwiches are my other picks haha. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here..whether you are sober or not!. . The busiest times are during peak meal times (12-1pm, 5-7pm) and after hours for the  clubbing crowd. However, there usually is a line regardless of any time of the day. My only gripe about this place is that sandwiches can be put together pretty sloppy...especially when it's busy. On my last trip this past weekend, they didn't cut the bread all the way through and were skimpy on meat filling (cranberry turkey sandwich). The other 2 times I ate here, everything was all good (normal day time hours).. . PRO TIP: If you can't grab a seat/table...take your food over to the sportsbook at the PH! It's right across from Earls, and you can enjoy your sandwich while catching up on the games in a big comfy sofa! . . Earl's you never fail me! Thank you.
Definitely Order:. 1. Chipotle Chicken Avocado Hot Sandwich. 2. Ham Egg 'N' Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich. 3. Chocolate Chip Cookie Bites. . Maybe Try:. 1. Ham 'N' Swiss. 2. Tomato Soup. . Skip:. 1. Brownie Bites - not bad, but nothing special. . Great value for money considering it's available 24/7 and on the strip. You must try it at least once when you visit Vegas - definitely worth the wait!
Best Sandwich on the strip! Always tastes fresh and love that the sandwiches are toasted. My favorites are the Chipotle Chicken, The Reuban, and the Earls Club. The are open 24 hours which is nice if you need a late night bite. Sandwiches are under $10 which is great pricing for the strip.
Great sandwiches and very reasonable price.  I got the roast beef sandwich.  Highly recommended for any budget conscious family trying to not spend a fortune for lunch.
Stayed in Orlando near Downtown Disney, didn't get into our hotel from our travels until about 10, went for a late dinner loved it, had to go back before we left. very affordable and very good food for being in downtown disney...
So while checking Yelp for some reasonable Vegas fare, I came across a venue with like 3000+ reviews, 1 dollar sign, and 4+ stars.  Check around, nothing else like it exists on The Strip.  Naturally, I had to go (mainly because I needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).  . . EoS is good, really good.  There's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  It's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  There's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (I never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine. . . I had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado thing, and later I had the Original 1786 or whatever.  The Original needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  I got the Chicken Chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  For like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.. . Note:  The sandwich isn't huge.  I only needed one, but I don't eat a lot.  Most dudes I hang with would need two to fill them up.  . . Note2: If you go for dinner, head into the PH and check out the Pleasure Pit.  You'll see.....
Pretty darn good! I like the chipotle chicken sandwich. When I feel like not eating meat I get the chipotle chicken without the chicken and bacon and just make it a chipotle avocado sandwich :) it's Amazing!
If you are looking for a cheap good place to eat in Vegas, this is the place to go! It is conveniently located on the strip in Planet Hollywood right by the casino. There is always a line, but it goes by relatively quick. The dining area is somewhat small with limited tables and most of the time they are usually full. But luckily they package the sandwiches "to go ready" so you are able to eat them anywhere. . . The first time I think I tried some of the ham and Swiss sandwich and another one I could not remember. They were both good, but nothing out of the ordinary for the sandwich.. . The second time I tried it I tried the chipotle chicken avocado which was amazing! I am one to not tolerate spiciness, but the chipotle sauce added just a kick of spiciness that was not too much. The bacon added some extra flavor to the sandwich. The sandwiches always come out hot and toasted on delicious bread.
Amaaaaaaaazing!. . It was so warm and delicious! This place is a must when you visit Las Vegas.
way too salty.. and very oily too.. . not salty in a savory way, salty in a pound of salt way... but I admit I would eat it again because it's easy to order and affordable enough considering Vegas prices..
Finally got to trying this place after seeing it across the street from Aria and I gotta say it was pretty amazing. The chipotle avocado burger had a decent amount of avocado and the chipotle sauce just made everything go well with each other. The brocoli soup was alright though, nothing special. . . The reason for three stars was the worker Susana who acted like a total bitch the whole way. She literally threw the food at my boyfriend and when we told her our order was wrong she grabbed the bag, proceeded to making the salad (plus throwing all the ingredients in container) and threw the bag once again! But we weren't the only ones who had this problem. With a good place with good food, I think she really needs to fix her customer service skills.
Delicious hot sandwiches on artisan bread! Great spot for a quick bite. They tend to have a long line, but it's not a long wait. Another thing... they're are open 247 so you can go anytime!! Tables are free for all so whatever you can grab.. . The tuna melt was hot and delicious. Added a lil tabasco sauce to give it a kick. Also tried the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich which was really good too.. . Great sandwich stop in Vegas for any time of day!
There's always a line for Earl's. It's not because of quality or portion, but because it's a $6 meal in the middle of the strip.. . I always order the Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich. I've tried the others, but they  lack in flavor in my opinion. The chipotle sauce definitely plays a role in my opinion though.. . They are open 24/7, but I highly do not recommend you come here during the middle of the night or after clubbing. The portions become about HALF the size.
Love the sandwiches here, they give them to you nice and warm. I have tried about 3 different flavors and have not been disappointed. Their tomato soup is the best!
Like everyone else, my gf and I came to Earl's to save some money for the lavish Vegas lifestyle. For our only meal of the day, we ordered the baja chicken salad, tomatoe soup, the montagu, earl club, and chipotle chicken avocado. It came out to be around $33. The sandwiches were typical, but the soup and salad exceeded my expectations and I would  definitely order them again next time. With this kind of diet I was able to waste more money on gambling.
Yummy sandwich, I stayed at Hollywood couple times. This place is always long line to wait. I strongly recommend you can call to order and pick it up in 10-15 minutes to void to wait time standing:) you can use this 10-15 min on slot machine to win win more $$$ :)
Gosh Earl of Sandwich! . . I don't think I have such a wonderful sandwich for a very long time.. I had avocado BLT and it was so damn good. The perfectly shaped/cut/wrapped bread with your choice of ingredient. I was actually surprised to find this place in the center of the strip. Everything else is crap with doubled price, yet this place manages to have great sandwiches with regular price! The service was quick and people were friendly.. . I'm not a sandwich person,but I don't mind having this earl of sandwich every single day for the rest of my life (no kidding). I'm really happy I trusted my fellow yelpers and found this place. Must come here when you're in Vegas!
Good food. Long line.
Great place to eat. I love there food. Its simple yet no  so simple. I will definitely be eating here again and will be definitely be recommending it to my friends and family.
I was disappointed the meatballs in my sandwich were over cooked and hard as a rock I could not even eat most of it
What can I say that hasn't already been said great sandwiches on the cheap.  Who doesn't like warm sandwiches with melted gooey cheese.  Yes there usually is a line but goes pretty quick.  It's loud and happening here and limited seating sometimes you may have to stand to eat.  I like that they have a good variety of sandwiches to choose from without being overwhelming. Good cheap eats that won't disappoint,  unless you hate sandwiches.
BEST SANDWICH EVER. I always make sure to stop by here when I'm in Vegas, and I'm never disappointed!. . I've tried the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich, Earl's club, and the full montagu and everything just tasted so fresh and amazing. It's hard to pick a favorite but I'd have to go with the chipotle chicken avocado. You just can't beat that perfect blend of toasty, warm bread, savory chipotle chicken, and fresh avocado. Now if only the portions were a teeenyyy bit bigger. They also offer other soups, salads, and sides that you can pick up for a fuller more satisfying meal though! . . It's open 24/7 so you can come by anytime you want (drunchies anyone?) Also the line will be long regardless of when you come but they handle it very efficiently. Each sandwich is about $7 including tax, but compared to the other expensive food on the strip, it's well worth the time and money.
Excellent sandwiches and salad! Reasonably priced and very efficient! My friends and I had the philly steak, earl's club, chicken salad and we absolutely loved it! Must try!
The best sandwiches. I got the chicken avocado chipotle. All I can say is yummmm and will def go back.
Better than Disneyland. . . Love the chipotle chicken and the holiday turkey :)
This place is alright.  I think my friends hyped up this place too much.  I got the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich.  Tastes like what it is.  I think the thing that is special about this place is probably that they tosat their sandwiches.  Comes out to look like a brick shaped sandwich.  The sandwich came out warm and crisp.  I was so hungry that I ate that sandwich super fast.  I didn't think it was that extraordinary.  I've had better sandwiches.  I felt like for the price I was paying there should have been more stuff in it.  It was a bit too plain for me.  I wish it had more veggies or something it in.  I felt like the sandwich was incomplete.  . . I would come back if I needed to grab something fast to eat.  I rather grab something else that Vegas has to offer.  Try it if you never had it though!  Not bad!
This is my favorite all around sandwich place. It used to be a bit cheaper but even with the increases over the years it is still a good deal. I love almost all the sandwiches on the menu and the ones I don't is just personal preference not that they are bad. (Tuna salad eww..) Try the original it's awesome! I used to work in the PH and was extremely glad of their late hours as its not easy to find a good meal after closing the club down. They always came through and no matter what time you visit your sandwich will always be hot and delicious.
Sandwiches don't excite me too much. When it does, it's goooooood. Why did I wait this long before trying EoS? I love their crunchy bread. Their meat to bread ratio isn't the greatest. Too much bread, not enough meat...but if you're carbo-loading or drunk, I guess that's a good thing.. . The Original 1762:. Roast beef, bacon, cheese, horseradish sauce. The flavor combinations were good. The saltiness from the beef and cheese plus, the nostril-burning sensation form the horseradish. 4.5/5. . Tuna Melt:. Albacore tuna salad & Swiss cheese. I only trust tuna sandwiches from a handful of places because I don't want a fishy and gross sandwich. 4/5. . I've heard good things about the Montagu so, I'll try that next time.
Good sandwich, but not 4.5 star good. The full Montague is good but nothing spectacular. Considering the price, size of the sandwich, the out of the way location, and the hype, it was disappointing. I guess I've been spoiled by Ike's in SF and Bay Cities in LA.
It was okay.  Can't compare to Ike's sandwich.  I had the pastrami rueben, very disappointed... Not even two layers of meat.   My sandwich was sad, which made this visit and experience sad.  Line was long and wait after ordering was long, you would think that the long wait meant good food, but it was completely opposite.. . A second visit would require me to be completely wasted.
I love this place great sandwiches. I always stop by here when I'm in Vegas. I wish I had one back home.
