Ichiza is one of the oldest izakaya place in Vegas and it has been opened for more than 10 years. I'm always neutral about this place because I haven't had a dish that makes me drool when I think about the place. . . Okay let me get to my complains first. The waitress that served us yesterday was rude and idiotic. She was short and annoyed from the start when she was taking order of the drinks. And my second complain was they charged $3.50 on the damn green tea but you can't get refills which makes absolutely no sense to me. Third complain was they charged us a fee to have birthday cakes. They don't even serve cakes in there and they are not a high end restaurant. It's ridiculous to me why they would charge a fee.. . They have a lot of stuff written on the wall that's not on the menu. If you go to this place, make sure to read the wall too. . . I like tacoyaki( octopus with batter and fried), tofu and tuna salad, kimchi pork, grilled octopus and their assorted skewers. . . Their food is not bad but at the same time not the greatest either. I still love Raku the most. I don't think I will return here anytime soon with this kinda service unless someone else wants to go.
Someone below mentioned Hondaya in LA, it DOES remind me of this place. We ordered half-size ramen dx, regular shoyu ramen, kushi katsu (tonkatsu on a stick with onions inside), fried quail eggs, beef tongue yakitori, agedashi tofu,  honey toast and a pitcher of kirin.. . FYI, 30 mins after the place opened, it was completely packed.
I believed the hype and made my family come here - twice - just to make sure I liked it or not. I will say that the food is good, but I wouldn't say it was so good it was totally worth the crowds. I'm always on the lookout for places that can rival all my favorites on both coasts, but this place is probably only a 3.6 for me personally. However, if you do decide to face the crowds, please do have the coffee jello and honey toast - both are delicious (Because always dessert...)!
Went here with a group of 8 and we were all disappointed. Thought it would be good from the reviews. The people I was with are more adventurous in seafood and still didn't like their stuff much. I just really wanted good sushi rolls, so if you want that, do not come here. . . FOOD:. Spider Roll (2 stars): Really dry, really plain. . . Tar Tar Roll (3 stars): It was like a sushi tostada. Pretty good, or just better than the spider roll.  . . Eel roll (3 stars): Probably the best roll out of the 3 I tried. Flavorful, not dry. Just not very healthy because of the fried stuff on top. . . Black cod fish (4 stars): Perfectly cooked. Best thing I had here. . . SERVICE (2 stars):. Didn't get menus, chopsticks, or plates until we asked for them. It's also really hot inside, hotter than outside, and this is Las Vegas in the summer we're talking about! It also smelled inside. We had a big group so we got one of the back tables where you need to take your shoes off to sit down...probably why the place smelled.  Who knows what's on peoples feet..gross!. . Overall, not a place for rolls. I really didn't like any of them that much, just ate cause I was hungry. Stick to entrees maybe? Well maybe not since the other people in my group who all got different entrees weren't impressed at all either.
I went  here to meet a friend for dinner based on yelp reviews.  Yuckie!  As I opened the door to walk in I was hit by the aroma of spoiling fish.  YUCK!  I wasn't sure I could stand it.  Because there were only two of us, the waitress sat us at the sushi bar so now my neck hurts from having to constantly turn my head to talk to my friend.  The tongue was tough; a 1/5, the miso butterfish was 3/5.  Is that the best you have?  The ambiance was 1/5 with sticky counters and food stained menus.  Would not recommend to anyone.  $53.00 for two people for mediocre food and one beer for each of us.  Tons of menu items written on paper posted to the walls, but you can't read them if you are sitting at the Sushi bar.  Bad format, bad smells, bad ambiance, bad food.
The food is good but the owners are so rude  and the management needs work. Not worth the bad service. He laughed at me for asking to sit at a table instead of the bar when the restaurant has 5 open tables because there was only 2 of us dining!
Made a stop here while on vacation.  This place was packed on a Wednesday night at 7 pm.  Should have a made a reservation as this placeis very small.  They have a small sushi menu so if you are one of those high end sushi snobs you'll be disappointed .  If you want to experience a traditional Japanese cooked cuisine then you've come to the right place.. Saw lots of reviews for the miso cod and the seaweed salad.. Cod was melt  in your mouth delicious ! Salad had a nice variety of seaweeds mixed with greens and cucumbers.  My kids ate the ramen with miso broth and loved it.  Just a note we didn't see other kids around , mostly young hipsters before hitting the night club scene .  Also got sticker shock on iced green tea.  Although it was very good, just wished they would have let me know they charge for refills .  Should have read the  reviews on the wall menu items... Would have been nice to know other options..  Overall we had a nice dinner and good food.
Ichiza features a wide array of Japanese food, but I went there for the ramen. Of course most places can't compared to the ramen straight from Japan, but it still did not completely satisfy. You know it's good when you finish the soup, but even when I was hungry, I still didn't finish it all. It lacked the right balance between too salty and too watery. This was too watered down. The service wasn't bad, and the atmosphere was great, but a restaurant is really judged on its food, so I would not recommend this place to friends.
I still have so many things I still need to try here. Ramen Rx spot on. Best I've ever had. Garlic bok choy, no brainer. Pork cutlet appetizer delicious. Mini curry corn dogs are a GEM. Still need the beef tongue, fried rice and cheese chicken. Shishito peppers were ok. But what stole the show: honey ice cream toast. You won't regret it.
Got the Gyu Nabe (hot pot.). It was amazing. I love ordering off the wall and trying new things. It is a refreshing change from American style dining( appetizer and everyone gets their meal at the same time.) highly recommend Ichiza for anyone who wants authentic Japanese food and fun atmosphere.
Ah, Ichiza. I gotta give it up, yo. It's most certainly always a good time when I roll through and I have no problem bringing friends to enjoy in your delectable delights. As some of my good friends know, I have this love-love relationship with  Japanese food and anytime the option presents itself to get my grub on, I am sure to follow through. Ichiza is one of those spots that I usually don't frequent too often like I do other Japanese establishments but if I have a pretty good sized group gathered willing to drink some beer or sake and have some small plates to accompany, this is usually my go to.  As far as food goes, I usually hit up the specials menu to start off the night.  Last time I stopped in, they had shigoku oysters, chu-toro, and kohada (as you can tell, I love me some SEAFOOD!.. or if you don't, google it heehee) on the special menu for the day and I delightfully ordered it up. The special menu rotates daily (?) so be sure to check it out whenever you stop in as it changes and presents some new stuff upon each visit.  From the regular menu, I am always happy to suggest the oyako don chicken bowl, ikayaki whole grilled squid, and the uni in ponzusauce (if they still have any in stock).  I always round it out with some sunomono cucumber or wakame seaweed salad to make my meal somewhat complete and to my definite satisfaction.  Not a big dessert guy but gotta give a shoutout to the honey toast here; definitely a fan favorite.. . Tip: look at the menu posted on the wall as some of it is not mentioned in the menu; if you have a big group, go early to get a table in before your patrons fully arrive to grub; and be sure to check out some of the bottled stuff aside from the house sake and beer as they have some tasty items chillin' in the back. . Enjoy!!
In Vegas for a bachelorette party, and it was our last night in town. After a lot of gambling, a 5-course meal at Picasso, a show at Thunder Down Under, and the V Lounge, we were ready for our second dinner.. aka midnight schmorgusborg. Took a cab from the Venetian, and in 5 minutes we were at Ichiza, at 2:30am. How awesome that their kitchen was still open? How great was it that there was the shortest wait, and the staff was enthusiastic and kind? It was all great. 5 stars, no joke.. . Random sheets of 8.5x11 sheets of paper taped up on the walls with various delectable items to order, as well as dry erase boards that have specialties listed. You also get a small half-sheet printout of what the daily special is. Each diner also gets a small tofu+seaweed salad to start.. . Chicken Gizzards - main reason we came, was craving this all day, and we got them two ways - garlic fried and also skewered and grilled -- delicious!! just the right amount of chew, and it was delectable. Whole Grilled Squid - it was fairly impressive to see an entire squid on a plate, and it was cut up to quarter inch lengths -- char-grilled and very flavorful. Uni - uni uni uni oooooooo--neeeee - wow this was amazing, the uni is served in half a lemon, and we ordered 7 of these -- fresh, sweet, so worth it. Crab Row Croquettes - crispy outside, and yummy not-too-gooey inside, served with a side of tangy dippy sauce. Broiled Mushrooms - more than 4 types of mushrooms, cooked to perfection -- however, if you want lots of flavor because you are somewhat tipsy, then you gotta add some soy sauce, otherwise the natural mushroom flavors may seem a bit tame. Honey Toast - so my friend said they forgot to toast the interior cube of bread, but it was my first time having it, so I didn't miss the toasting. Basically, a big cube of texas toast hollowed out, and served up buttered and drizzled with honey, and a side of vanilla ice cream. . I regret that I was so eager to try their small plates that I completely neglected to order any of their ramen dishes. I would definitely come here again, and I do recommend it for late night dining and a great place to bring friends.. . This place is in Chinatown, so it's not walking distance to the Strip, and there is a shortage of taxicabs in this side of town. Be prepared to order a cab to pick you up, and the restaurant staff is helpful at placing the call and giving directions on your behalf.
Everything was great except the long wait! I read yelp reviews prior to visiting this place and I'm glad I did. I ordered the honey bread since everyone recommended so, and it was SOO GOOOOD! you should ask honey on the side or else they'll pour it until it gets too sweet! I've always went to restaurants on the Strip while staying in Vegas not knowing about this place, but I definitely will be back here the next time I visit. . . The restaurant is small but the ambiance was cozy/romantic and also had the traditional Japanese style.. We ordered the honey bread (MUST), tofu salad, chicken and beef bowl, takoyaki, pork cutlet, kimchi-pork fried plate, and one more dish but came out to about only $70! (for 4 people!) . . Except for one middle-aged lady around her early 40s(?) being a little grumpy to us, all other young waitresses were friendly and attentive. . . Parking is easy since this place is located in a small plaza.
I've been here since my teeny bopper years and it's been like a roller coaster! I remember it use to be much different from now. For some reason the food is just not as good as it use to be. The chefs appear to be the same or at least one of them is so I can't quite pin point as to why. The flavors just isn't there. For example I always order the jalapeno fried rice and it gets worse everytime I order it. Por que?!! I love this joint and it's twist on Japanese cuisine but it can definitely improve on it's quality and consistency. Service has been and still is decent. Maybe we need to bring back #TBT.
Thank God for Yelp in helping me find this place.  When we got there, we ACTUALLY waited 40 minutes for a table.  I never wait that long, but I figure there was a reason why.  I made use of my time and observed plates while waiting.  If you really don't want to wait, they just opened a sister restaurant down the street.  I have no idea why the hostess didn't tell us this when we decided to wait.  Also, you can just put in your name, and give them your cell, go grab a drink, and they will call you when your table is ready.  An asian woman actually tried to get a table without waiting by claiming she & her 3 friends eat REALLY fast and that she was there because she didn't like Nobu-LOL, are you kidding me lady?  Well after having dinner there,  I would fly back to Vegas for some more! I just wish I could read Japanese. Writings of menu items all over the walls, you kind've wonder if you're missing out on something.  It was amazing to be seated right by the sushi bar where platings were placed to be picked up. We saw items that didn't even appear on the menu but are located on the walls around the restaurant(written in japanese).. . It was like dining in Nobu's kitchen before he became popular! We ordered the wasabi octopus which was out of this world - live octopus marinated in wasabi/yuzu sauce. We also ordered the wagyu beef carpaccio - the best carpaccio I've had.  It tastes similar to vietnamese filet mignon carpaccio but better.  I has a yuzu sauce to flavor it up & fried shallots & shaved onions.  It literally tasted like a medium rare burger with all the fixins.  A dish you really need to try if you're a foodie like me.  We also ordered the tofu/tuna salad which is very refreshing and delicious.  The yellowtail sashimi was served with the fatty part of the tuna along with some of the fat under the skin.  I've never had yellowtail with these parts still attached but it was heavenly like butter.  There were so many orders of stuffed French toast coming out of the kitchen & I promise the next time I will try it but for now, yeah I'm stuffed.  Can't wait to come back for more at this gem.
This was our first stop in Vegas! As asians, obv we love chinatown. But even if you're not asian, who doesn't? The prices are great, the food is great. The only thing that was really weird is that their full menu is not on the menu they hand you. They have parts of the menu posted on the walls/chalkboards, so we had to get upto read them. That was strange... I was like hovering over a group of people seated at their tables, enjoying their food. But anyways, I got a grilled fish - so good. Baby bok choy - simple but delicious. Yellowtail tar tar - deeeelicious. Honey toast - wow, some parts were completely saturated with honey, and other parts not so much. it was so saturated to the point that we couldn't eat it, except for C who has a crazy intense love affair with honey. It was good, but the ice cream to toast ratio was not high enough imo. I wouldn't get it again. . We could have easily come back for another meal.
Ate here last night 6/29/2014.  Me and 4 others ate here and towards paying our bill, one of my friends noticed a B grade hanging up near the kitchen as well as a C grade near the entrance door.  If we noticed this before eating we wouldn't have eaten here.  This is my 2nd time eating at this place and never seen a grade for a restaurant with a B.  or either both a C.  If you plan on eating here, I would think twice.  This restaurant needs to update their grade.  Will not eat here again until this issue is resolved
Great Japanese food and environment. Always busy so make sure to make a reservation and have the honey toast for dessert!
