The best thing about this place was the view. The restrooms near the bar area have amazing views as you sit on the toilet looking out at Mandalay Bay. The food was ok....pricey and not the quality I've had for that price. I would come back only for the bar area and view not dinner. Go somewhere with better quality for this price.
Food was good but not outrageously great for the price you pay.  We got the 4 course menu with wine pairing and it definitely filled us up but the experience was horrible. As soon as we walked in we came across a snotty hostess thinking that we couldn't afford the place and from there the workers were horrible. Service matters even if the food is great. Our experience here after spending 500 dollars was horrible. I had excellent service at craft steak at MGM and better food. Our waiter was great at MGM making jokes with us and talking with us. Mix, you guys have to step up your service even though the food is great. Don't get me wrong, the ambience is awesome but the service put our experience down. If your young, I don't think you'll get great service. But why should that matter!?!?!?
Two words: lobster au curry. This dish was to die for and absolutely fantastic. Everything about this place is excellent from the service to the ambiance to the view to the wine selection to the food. I stayed at Mandalay Bay which is next door to The Hotel where the restaurant is located over Halloween, and made a reservation for dinner one night. We were seated right away and given just the right amount of attention. Loved it!
Beautiful strip views. This is a great, great spot to stop for a few cocktails and enjoy the sights. My sangria was delicious and the rest of my group seemed to enjoy their drinks. I was a little disappointed with the apps selection and thought the food was just OK. The bathroom views are absolutely INSANE. Come for a drink on the outdoor patio, and make sure you go to the bathroom. Enough said.
This is probably my favorite bar/lounge on the strip. It never gets too packed here, there are plenty of tables and seating in the lounge area, and best of all is the amazing view from anywhere inside Mix including in the restrooms! I've been here a few times and almost always try to bring visiting friends and family here, or at least recommend that they check it out. I haven't tried their restaurant, but heard they have a daily happy hour. . . Sometimes the line for the elevator can get a little long here but I've never had to pay cover just to go up. Drinks are standard strip pricing so expect to pay about 8-9 bucks for a beer. Bar service is top notch though and even when there's a crowd there I can get in and out with my drinks pretty quickly.. . There are booths for bottle service both inside and on the balcony. Mix also has a small dance floor in front of the elevators, but this is mostly a lounge atmosphere so no one is ever really dancing! This is a classy joint but dress code isn't enforced too stricly as I've seen people walking around in shorts and/or t-shirts...
Having a romantic dinner @ Mix before attending the Cirque De Soleil Michael Jackson show at the Mandalay Bay was a great choice. The staff is warm, there are various menu choices, the setting is intimate, topped with a gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip. Additionally the food was well prepared and extremely flavorful. My Filet Minion was tender with flavor oozing out, and my Boyfriend's Roasted Maine Lobster Au Curry was savory and inviting to my fork. There was room for desert so we ordered a decadent cheesecake with sorbet and oooooooooooo it was so good!! As a persnickety New York foodie, I was amazingly impressed by this restaurant, and if I am ever in Vegas again, I will definitely make another reservation.
Las Vegas has a bad rep for having a lot of restaurants that are like one to two steps worse than the original. Alain Ducasse is obviously a word class chef, but it would seem he hasn't set foot in Mix in like 2 years. The food is MEH at best. Underwhelming would be the best word to describe it. The service was good - when I sent my halibut back for being dry as a bone they promptly sent over a new one that was not dry, but still, the flavors are lacking. There are great restaurants in Vegas so my advice would be not to waste your time at Mix.
The meal at Mix closed a great evening for us after the M.J. Show. We've eaten here before and it never disappoints. We shared the Dungeness crab salad and ordered lamb and halibut dinners splitting them up. All I can say is best meal in recent memory. Great service and had a window table with fantastic view.
If you're not busy don't sit around and talk to people when you have patrons waiting for service.
This place used to be fun but is now overrun by tables as if it was primarily a restaurant. Boring. Advertise yourself as a restaurant and not a club and you'll be fine. Wasted $20. Thanks.
I was invited here by one of my good friends that works here, to be honest it wasn't my cup of yea at first music wasn't great, weird music to be exact but he insisted I stay for awhile. He ordered my girlfriend and I some champagne and we drank and stood on the patio "best view in Vegas" !!! My friend met a nice guy there by the name of Matt I think real polite got us around of shots. They take real good care of the guest John Watkins is a godsend and Matt if that's your name we love you thanks john for insisting we stay
