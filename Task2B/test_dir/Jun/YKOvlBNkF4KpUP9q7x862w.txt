I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. They had limited seating the night we arrived, but the manager went out of his way to get us a seat. His customer service is unparalleled and he truly made us feel welcome in this restaurant. Not only that, but he had the food to back it all up. The portions were just the right side and I left satisfied and full. I would definitely go back again, add it was an overall wonderful experience.
Excellent quality but perhaps a bit pricey and the portions are  tiny. Nice setting though and service was outstanding. Would definitely go back just for the tableside guacamole.
The mission was amazing. The atmosphere was wonderful and romantic. The food was just as wonderful. The table side guac was delightful and their filet was a great cut and was cooked perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.
No matter the dining experience you want to have, you'll find it one of the spaces this old mission offers.  From the front patio, to the inside space and the back patio, each one offers a unique experience.  Being on the back patio reminds of my years living in Mexico City with the high walls, the very same marble surrounding the fountain, right down to the shade structure.  It feels like at any moment they could move the tables and start dancing.. The food is ridiculous and the staff knows too much about all of it ;-). I could sit on that back patio and relax (read, drink) for days.  You forget you're in Scottsdale.
Great Place! The Mission was recommended to us by a local shopkeeper and so happy we decided to go try it. First off the decor and atmosphere is great (Love the Himalayan Salt block wall) This place is upscale Mexican and a little pricier than your normal Mexican fare but absolutely worth it. The chips they bring to the table are fresh, warm, light and crispy and the Salsa is wonderful has a little kick to it but full of flavor. I wish they sold this bottled up to go. We also got table side guacamole which may be one of the best guacamole's I've ever had. Everything our table ordered was delicious, the pork shoulder and skirt steak tacos both wonderfully seasoned, succulent and tender. The papas y chorizo is wonderful and we also got a huge bowl of the mission fries which are a must try!
The food was good but I will never eat there again! I called a week in advance for a reservation at 8:15 on a Friday night. There was a specific table that I wanted and told them that it was for a special occasion. They assured me that I would have that table. They called the day before to confirm my reservation. I was reassured that my reservation was for the table that I requested. I received another call from them the day of. The hostess said that they had another party coming in for that table at 9:45 and that I could show up a little early if I wanted to ensure that our meal would not be rushed. I told her we would show up at 8. We got there at 7:55 and were shown to our table, however it was not the table I had requested. Instead it was a tiny table cramped in between two other table with no room to move. I went back to speak to the hostess and told her that it was not the table we requested. She looked in the system and said that she must have missed the note and asked very rudely, "Well what would you like me to do, ask the people sitting there to move?" As bad as I wanted to say yes, I wasn't going to be that guy. I understand restaurants get busy, but I would not have chosen to dine here that evening had I not been assured that we would be seated at the table I requested. We even adjusted our plans to show up early to ensure we would not be rushed. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food was, I will only remember how they screwed up my reservation and acted as if I was an inconvenience. . . That being said, the table side guacamole is very good! The pork shoulder tacos were good, (the pineapple habanero glaze is excellent) but certainly not worth the $32. The Jodori chicken was okay, but nothing great. I would have certainly gone back to try other items on the menu but their lack of attention to detail completely spoiled the experience. I will not be retuning.
Had dinner at The Mission a few nights ago and it did not disappoint. The guacamole was amazing! Seriously maybe the best we've ever had. We were dining with our five-year-old and the waiter was so accommodating in terms of adjusting the spiciness. The pork tacos were great, the Mexican grilled corn was delicious, and the margaritas were perfect. We'll be back!
This is the real deal - the straight up tastiest tacos in the valley. We went on a business lunch (5 of us) and ordered some of everything. My favorite were the pork - the right combo of crunch, sweet, tender meat, spice - amazing. I brought a couple of extras back to the office and gave to a few employees - one said it was the best thing he had ever tasted in his life (not the best TACO he had ever tasted, the best ANYTHING he had ever tasted) and it is hard to argue. Quaint patio and table side made guac as well - are you kidding me?? Go eat there.
Great place for a more upscale date night long wait so make reservation a few days in advance but  the food is worth it the pork cola lettuce wraps are super good
I've sat inside and on each of the patios (front and rear). The rear patio is equipped with a mega fan; keeps the area super cool for a romantic evening! The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit...good for date night. The service, as with the food, has always been amazing. This last visit, I ordered the spinach salad and the scallops (phenomenal!). The waitress was very attentive and knowledable of the entrees. Great place to go before or after the theatre or for brunch after the Saturday morning market!
After finding this place on yelp, I had to try it.  . . Place was busy so I was seated at the bar.  Cassie the bartender was very good at describing the menu and explaining the chef's creations.  It's always awesome to eat at places where the staff knows the chef's inspirations and goals.  She was also very friendly and her recommendations were top notch.. . Started off with chips, salsa and table side guacamole.  Everything was especially the guacamole.  It was fresh and very flavor full.. . For dinner I had the fillet with candied bacon.  It was cooked perfect and it was very flavorful.  Having tried steaks at many nice steakhouses this place does it well.. . I would highly recommend this place if you're in Scottsdale.
Love this place mainly for the ambience. The food is great too but really like its style. I've been here twice and we ordered the guacamole prepared table side both times.
Whenever we have guests visit us, we always take them here.  I love their food, I love their atmosphere and they have such a great wine list.  Honestly, I loved everything that they have. We always get their Guac, their pork shoulder is always fantastic and I love churros.  I think this restaurant is a great way to introduce people to Mexican/Hispanic food that has been elevated to the next level.  Make reservations though, because otherwise you could be chilling at the bar for quite a while.  Though with their Briar Rose and wine list, it wouldn't be such a bad punishment.
Not what I expected at all.  I would have never choose this restaurant by the look, but glad I went to meet friends.  Amazing food, great drinks, and the most helpful/knowledgable wait staff I've ever had.  Little pricey but I definitely recommend.
Unbelievable flavors! The combinations in the dishes were perfect. Believe the hype about the street corn. We had it off the cob and it was creamy, with just the right amount of cheese and spice to enhance the corn without hiding it's flavor.  I'd go again tomorrow !
The decor was impressive, simple outside with a very elegant interior.  . The staff was friendly, but not efficient at all. . The table side guacamole was delicious but a little too thick and in a small weird boll that made eating it very difficult. . We had tacos as a starter instead of salad, chicken and Mahi Mahi,  different and very good. Except they don't allow mixing the kinds so you have to have three of each, which gets old after two, if that were your entree. . We had the salmon plate and chicken plate as our entree, both very good, beautiful presentation,  but extremely small portions and a little under seasoned. . We didn't have a desert as they didn't seem very interesting. . Over all, nice but not worth the price.
This is one of those restaurants where you are paying more for the nice ambiance and a lot for decent tasting food that you can obviously get somewhere else for a lot less.  But hey, it's nice to go out to fancy shmancy places sometimes.... . We were seated right away since we had reservations.  The mission was packed on a Saturday night, ambiance is dark and I guess you could say sexy (as I heard the table next to us saying).  Our waitress was attentive and made recommendations as we requested.  . . Guacamole- this is made fresh and right next to your table.  I thought this was good and full of flavor, different than other guacs I'm used to bc this one had a bunch of stuff mixed into it.  My hubby though thought this was ok since he prefers simple guac of just the avocado, cilantro, lime and onions.  So just depends on your preference.. . Almejas al vapor- some sort of clam and shrimp stew.  We ordered this bc it was recommended.  I love salty food and this was waaaay too salty, not even good salty.  Our waitress was nice about it and took it back, later she said the chef agreed it was too salty and apologized.  What was even classy of them is they took it off our tab and gave us a free dessert.  I don't remember the name of the dessert but it was yummy, the best thing we ate here besides the corn.. . Grilled street corn- ok I don't know why we ordered this when you can get this for a buck at a swapmeet.  But it was deelish, nice and buttery.. . Grilled chicken tacos- we were warned these were tiny and yup they're tiny, smaller than street tacos! . . We wanted to order the short rib entree but they were sold out that night :-(  . . So overall, this place isn't horrible.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but we just weren't impressed and prob wouldn't go back if we were in town again.
