We have been here many times before and LOVED it. Today however was not as great as our previous visits the food still awesome, the people working friendly but they had a awful fly situation going on that made my mom and I totally lose our appetites. Hope they fix it ASAP!
We have come here twice for breakfast,  mainly because the lines later in the day get ridiculously long. Both times, breakfast was great. I had the breakfast tacos and more recently had the green eggs and ham scramble. Both entrees were generously portioned,  although my one complaint would be that the fruit cup I got to accompany the scramble was really small. Especially when you compare it to the generous side of potatoes my husband got with his scramble. Eh, it's a small thing, because in hindsight the food tastes great,  and the fruit itself was fresh. . . Their coffee is really good, although I have one small complaint here, too. There's only one coffee pot that's left out to serve all the people there for breakfast,  so it runs out a lot and I usually get stuck with asking for more. Maybe we can put out 2 or 3 coffee pots? That might quicken up the speed of the coffee station as a whole, too.. . I love the ambiance of the farm right outside and there's plenty of seating choices to choose from. It's very serve-yourself here, and that's ok, just don't come in expecting a fine dining experience. It's wholesome food, and I always leave feeling satisfied.
Food was good, no doubt. We visited twice and tried a wide variety of items. All of them tasty and well prepared.  But the prices are ridiculously high for what you get. The indoor seating area was pretty bad. Fairly messy and dirty. And the constant fight against the swarms of flies made eating here a chore rather than a pleasure. Outside seating looks better, but when it's 110 degrees out, inside is the only option. The cafeteria style ordering system was very slow and seems very inefficient.  It's  unlikely we will visit again even though the food was quite tasty.
Awesome place. Visited from California... wish we had something like this place here. Got the fontina burger one day and the BBQ Chicken pizza the next. The "grilled" pizza has an awesome charred taste.. . Wish I could have tried the apple fritters but I walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. They should really serve those all day long.
I've been here twice. Pretty inconsistent IMO. The first time food was awesome, second time it was very greasy. Also, pretty expensive. 27 bucks for 2 burgers and sodas is a little steep for a non sit down restaurant that isn't in Manhattan.
Did not like the food, pancakes not cooked through, counter service for breakfast. This place was horrible!  Won't be back
Joe's offers some extremely delicious items. Some of the ones I've tried include the Fontina Burger, jumbo shrimp, and Southwest Burger.. . I'm giving it four stars instead of five due to some so-so menu items and a preference for a different type of ordering and seating.
This is one of my favorite places for fresh real food! Every time I come here, I always get the same thing because it's my favorite salad ever. I get the grilled portabella mushroom farm salad...and usually with a side of sweet potato fries. The salad is full of all different textures and flavors that blend well together to make such a delicious salad! Being a BIG fan of sweet potato fries, they by FAR have some of the best! You know when somewhere is absolutely fantastic when you regularly crave their food!
We love Joe's Farm Grill!! I've had the Fontina Burger twice now and it is delicious! I love sitting outside under the big trees. There is a fun feeling about this place. The fries here are not my favorite, so I like to get a side Caesar salad instead at no charge!
I have no idea what the big deal is about this place. The lines to get food belie the complete mediocrity of it. They should have stopped at 'Common Food...' in their motto. . . I ordered the grilled veggie omelet and was so underwhelmed that I was more fascinated by the fact that I'd never seen a grapefruit tree before. Now THAT was awesome. . . It was overpriced and underflavored. I would go back and try other things, but I don't do heart attack food that well and I eat mostly vegetarian so I guess I'll never be back. Oh well.
Finally made it out to Joe's and LOVED it! Everything was so fresh.. and the 'serve yourself' condiment/drink station is set up nicely and conveniently. I ordered the Southwest Burger, and it was tasty! They've got plenty for everyone and lots of outside seating (when it's not too hot) :) Will return!
Everything at this place is wonderful.  Honestly though, if I haven't come by recently then I can't avoid ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  All fresh ingredients.  Just be ready for a line if you come during rush hours.
