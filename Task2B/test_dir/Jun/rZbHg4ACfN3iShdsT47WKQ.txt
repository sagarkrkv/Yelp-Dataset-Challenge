Super smokey deliciousness, try the sangria (you're welcome) you also get homemade donuts for free to take home and enjoy later cause you have no room left in you're tummy from all the steak, baby back ribs, pulled pork and juicy chicken...
My husband and I tried this place last weekend and I'm so glad that we did. Their food was great and so was the service. My husband ordered brisket and ribs and he was in heaven after he finished eating. The portions of food are very decent for the price. We will definitely be going back to this place again. If you're a fan of this type of food then I definitely recommend giving this place a try.
Went to Bobby Q tonight and really enjoyed it.  My partner and I started with house salads which were very fresh and tasty.  Then we shared the 3 meat sampler dinner and I am glad we shared, the portions are rather large.  Our dinner came with your choice of two sides.  We shared the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket; our sides were mac and cheese and beans. The cornbread and the doughnuts at the end were quite enjoyable.   Everything was delicious.  The great thing was that since we told them we were sharing, they split the dinner on two plates so we didn't have to do that at the table.  We decided to only eat half of our dinner so that we could order dessert.  The dessert was good but not anything really special.  We had the apple cobbler.  The menu said peach and I would have enjoyed that more.  It was good.  Overall our evening was very nice.  The service was amazing and the place has nice ambience.  We will definitely be back.
They were so friendly here and the food was delicious. A bit expensive but it was worth it. We'll be back.
Family and I are from St. Louis and we were on vacay and I checked yelp for the most popular place for BBQ and OMG I'm so happy we came here ! I made a reservation and when we got there no wait or delay .. Every one was friendly! I've been a waitress before and the one we had was AWESOME please ask for Chelsea when you go! Very sweet and knows what she's talking about!.. Recommendations were on point .. The food was to die for! Ribs fell right off the bone, Mac n cheese was great, everything was just OMG! My friends and family couldn't stop raving about it!!! Even tho Chelsea was waiting on us, others would ask how we were doing and the manager came and made sure we were doing good. When we come visit phoenix az again this will be our most go spot! Thank you for the great experience guys! Thank you Chelsea, when we come back well ask for you! . ***Liana P***
One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley! Service is always wonderful. The meats are always tasty and tender (I think my husband and I have tried every option!) and the sides never disappoint. I dislike cornbread but theirs is AMAZING! I also usually get the Sangria, which is pretty good. . . All in all I think it's always been worth the wait (it gets busy on the weekends, just like everywhere else) and the money.
Really really good service by Victoria! The food was good to! I had to meet special I had Louisiana style ribs and the roasted beef.  You need to try the macaroni and cheese is incredible and the roasted corn is great! I did the 10% checking offer so make sure you do that  too.
The food was awesome, the atmosphere was great, and service was perfect. We really enjoyed the chicken, beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket that we had. The only let down was the corn bread which was kinda dry. The special (forget the name) margarita was ok... not all the waitress chalked it up to be but she didn't look old enough to drink so maybe that was the issue there. Ill get the thing in the pineapple I see pictures of next time. Its a little tough to find, but with GPS it was not too bad. Service was really great, our waitress was on top of it. A manager even came and asked if there was anything he could do for us. We forgot at the end of the meal to show our yelp discount and they reversed our charges and added the discount, no problem. We will definitely make it a regular spot! Only thing I was a little confused about is there seems to maybe be a bar on the back of the restaurant? We looked for it but couldn't seem to find a way in...
Short version: The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! 5 stars.. . Long version: . . Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.. . Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors. . . When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!. . Food: AMAZING! . . Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.. . Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread "patties", this might be your thing.. . Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.. . Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.. . Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.. . Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.. . Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.. . This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :). . Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!
Bobby Q has a rustic, Western vibe with a music selection customary of a traditional BBQ joint. The play on words for the restaurant's title was whatcaught my attention but I came into Bobby Q with my sister and boyfriend since we were craving some good BBQ. . . We ordered the Cajun Shrimp appetizer to start. The shrimp is sauteed in beer; this was the standout factor for me in this dish because I could actually taste the flavor of the beer, which complemented nicely with the Cajun seasoning and butter. . . We ordered the Full Baby Back Rib BBQ Platter to split 3 ways. You can choose from a list of sides such as mac and cheese, shoestring fries, ranch beans, mashed potatoes and pecan cole slaw. We decided to get mac and cheese and shoe string fries. I was expecting to be given additional plates to pick off the rib platter but our waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen split the dish on 3 separate plates, with a portion of mac and cheese and shoe string fries on each plate. Right when I started cutting my ribs, the meat fell cleanly off the bone. The 22 hour smoking process yields amazing results because the meat was moist, tender and just plain heavenly! The BBQ sauce was tangier than most but was delicious. My sister even loved the ribs and she's not a huge meat person. . . Lastly, what made the experience worthy of the 5 star rating was the service. The service was PHENOMENAL! Our waitress, Kessa, was informative on the restaurant's history (they used to be Bobby McGee's!) and their smoking process (the meat is smoked for up to 22 hours). In addition, the manager/restaurant owner personally came up to our table to see how we were enjoying our food. Our waitress was also sweet enough to bring us a half dozen complementary cinnamon donuts to end our meal!
Bobby Q was excellent for Father's Day lunch. Service was excellent and the food was the best BBQ ever! This is the best BBQ in Arizona! Yummm
Good staff, great drinks, good BBQ.
My boyfriend was in the mood for prime rib today so I did a goggle search for places in our area. One of the listings that came up was Bobby Q. Based on the name and description as a BBQ restaurant, we were a bit unsure, but decided to trust the fantastic reviews. . The service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10. . . The food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and sauteed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly. . Once the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service. We are planning on returning and telling all our friends how wonderful Bobby Q is!
Good food, I wanna say decent service.. Waiter came by and commenced by greeting us and took our drink order, he didn't come back. Instead another younger kid came over and said "hi I'll take care of you, the other guy got flustered and is gone"! We didn't ask why or what but you must admit that's a bit weird no? . Anyway this new waiter kid was good, he did take good care of us in the end :) . Um the food was ok, good, decent, average.. No negative remarks about the actual food or even the place. I guess the only downfall is that it's located In a ghetto-esque neighborhood. And also they are overpriced. To me they are charging as if they are a fine dining spot, which they are not. It's a casual restaurant in a Not so great location. So yea no.  I might go back for a mai tai one day as That was the highlight of my evening there. Thanks.
What a find!  Being Southern, I was skeptical at first about finding good Southern food in Arizona.  We drove up and parked in the adjacent parking lot, and were surprised that the entrance was on the other side of the building!  But the rustic looking building was attractive on the outside, and when we entered we were surprised at how classy looking the inside was.  We were seated earlier than our 7:00 p.m. reservation on Open Table at comfortable booths that had movable banquettes on each side-- booths are sometimes a problem for me due to my size, but problem solved!  We of course had to order the local specialty draft, Bobby-Q's Amber Ale from Sonora Brewing, and we both enjoyed our pints, accompanied by sweet corn bread muffins, which my wife said were made from Jiffy mix, which we both love anyway.  We then selected the onion block, accompanied by a delicious Bobby-Q sauce for dipping, and we could not eat it all and brought about a third of it home.  Lightly battered and delicious.  We then chose to split the combination platter at the recommendation of our super friendly and attentive waiter, Jason, and he was so right because we even took part of that home too.  The one we chose had both of our favorites on it,  baby back ribs for me and fried catfish filet for my wife.  The catfish was perfect and savory, and the ribs fell off of the bones--honestly, I did not use my knife to separate them, just my fork.  For our sides we chose ranch beans, simmered with pork shreds and delish, and pecan cole slaw, which I don't eat but my wife wanted to try.  She liked the slaw, but the chopped pecans were just sprinkled on top and were not as good as those we have in Georgia.  Jason brought us a box for the leftover onion loaf and a rib, along with a short small brown bag, cut off and imprinted with "THANK YOU" on it, containing four little cute fried sugar donuts, a nice touch.  The manager came by near the end of our meal to ask how everything was, and we praised the food and Jason's service.  A beautiful night out and we felt like we were back in the South!
My wife took me and my parents here to eat on  father's day and the food was awesome as usual. The negative first...our. 5:30 reservation turned into a 6pm seat time...but what can you expect on a day like this. Positive...our waiter Justin was amazing. As busy as it was Justin was extremely attentive and very well  versed in the menu (and he is relatively new there). In addition, his conversational skills are such that it made for a relaxing and enjoyable evening. Thank you Justin!!!
When you walk in it feels very welcoming. The staff there is wonderful. Our server was on top of everything they were very quick at refilling our drinks and getting us anything we asked for. The food came out really fast which was surprising. I was highly satisfied with the quantity and quality of our food . The bbq ribs are to die for! I live over an hour away from this place, but it's worth the drive !
If your a true BBQ lOVER as I am this is the one to visit! I've had the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket and it's all good. I've drive out of my way and don't mind passing other by on the way. A little pricey but we'll worth it, I'll definitely be back again and again two thumbs up
GREAT FOOD, GREAT PLACE, especially in the evening.  This is not for kids or babies, this is place for romance and dancing.  The staff is wonderful, enjoy the food, make sure you get their mac and cheese they won an award for it.  The salads, ribs. and everything is to die for.
My fiance and I were SPEECHLESS. It was nothing short of PERFECTION. We were greeted by the friendliest staff, the food was beyonddd amazing. Everythibg is made from scratch so if you don't finish your food, expect to get the best quality left overs for the day after. We got the combo deal with two one half ribs two one half meats and three choices of sides. This is a one of a kind bbq place worthy of the travel and food networks. I'll be back soon.
For me, best barbecue around. Next closest is Franklin's in of Austin Texas. They work hard on the quality and it is always very tasty.
Had a great dinner at Bobby Q's, tonight, as always the food was amazing, especially the mac and cheese and I must say our waiter DEAN was awesome! He explained all the specials offered suggestions and when our food was served made sure to check and see that it was cooked to order, which it was! Definitely recommend Bobby Q's, great atmosphere, great food and great staff!
A girlfriend of mine wanted to give this place a try. I personally shy away from BBQ spots as they generally are overpriced, they over-sauce and under produce according to my BBQ standards. However, this place is good and I will definitely return. We decided on the Whole Hog Heaven as we are East Valley folk and although we plan on returning it may be a while, so a sample of everything is what we were aiming for. We chose the baby backs and St. Louis for ribs and sausage and brisket for our other meat options. For sides we ordered the Mac and Cheese, which was delicious by the way, fries, ranch beans and an extra side of roasted corn. The meal came with cornbread.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The ribs were tender, meat falling off the bones. The brisket was good but I have had better. The sausage was tasty but nothing spectacular. All of the sides were tasty. I left there with a full belly, a hefty to go bag and no compliant. I will be back.
We came here because I wanted to try something different. This place had very good reviews on Yelp so I thought I would give it a try and I'm glad I did. Bobby Q had really great food, service and an all around great experience.
I love this place!!!!! Great pricing on Food! Wonderful costumer service and I love the experience I get when I'm there ! The food is amazing !!!!!
First time visit-read other reviews and decided to swing by. Dean our server recommended "The Whole Hog" and suggested the sides. He was spot on with his recommendations and his service and personality made our meal "wicked good". . . If you want good BBQ, put this place on your list and ask for Dean, he will take you to the promise land.
My reason for the low rating is due to misinformation about their happy hour buffet regulations. I did some researching before heading last night and nowhere did I read about an age restriction in order to partake in the section where they hold the buffet. So when my husband and I and our friends, who had a baby with them tried going in we were shocked to learn we wouldn't be allowed to go in because we had a baby with us. Yet none of this information was posted any where so we were all surprised. Also the fact that there was no manager present did not help our situation, what place doesn't have a manager present at all times? What made things worst was how the host who went by choo choo came off to us as rude when dealing with our situation. We had a big group of friends waiting for us at the patio, where we could of easily been seated but had to turn away and leave our friends because they refused to let us go in. Disappointing costumer service to say the least.
The nicest staff you'll ever meet, great food and real southwest atmosphere!. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Ribs (full rack), Steak and Cajun Shrimp a must! Start off with the onion block and then enjoy some cornbread as well prior to your entree.. The portions are large and the side dishes (2) come with each entree. So be careful how much you order- maybe one entree and some apps.. Sit inside or outside and use Open Table for no waiting! . . A win win for all the family!!!
The Corn Bread was the BOMB and the the RIBs were even better.. I'm a fan of Tony Roma's RIBs and there is not one here (yet?) in Phoenix, so I tried this place and will be back again. The mashed potatoes were ok. and so was the Mac N Cheese as my 3 year old tore that up. My 8 year old tore up the RIBs and bone almost, lol.. I wouldn't recommend Sunday's though as it was PACKED and took longer than anticipated. So if you're hungry and it's not Sunday, I recommend this place.. The area is NOT my favorite place to be as I used to live literally on the same block (neighborhood) and it's kind of ghetto (IMHO).. Lost 1 star for the Sunday wait and location.
I love their Sunday special--they certainly don't hold back on the meat part (you get chicken, ribs, brisket and pulled pork); but they skimp on the sides.  This is the second time we've had sides that do not even come close to filling the containers--the mac and cheese was short at leas an inch from the top.  We had four of us and each got a tablespoon (and a little one at that).  I even told the gal who took the order to make sure the side containers were full; but I guess she didn't.  The next time, I'm going to open the containers while I'm there and make sure they don't fall short.
