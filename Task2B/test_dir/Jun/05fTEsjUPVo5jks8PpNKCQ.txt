Tonight was a good night for new culinary experiences. After watching the new Maleficent movie and having a few glasses of wine, we decided to make our way to Rollin Smoke. I have heard nothing but great things about this place. After checking Yelp, I noticed their 4.5 star overall rating with about 500 reviews. OH-EM-GEE, how have NOT been to this place yet?!?!. . It's not surprise, this place is in the middle of an industrial area, right under the freeway and next to all the strip clubs. Sketchy as heck, but holy smoker in their parking lot! The aroma of smoked meats filled the air. I didn't care what the outside looked like, I was more interested in what they had to offer! The inside of the joint is a down home BBQ joint! Different reds and yellows adorn the wall, different rooms to accommodate different types of parties. They have a few rooms and even outside space. There were metal table tops, wooden benches, TVs in each room and a mirage on the back wall of the room we chose to dine in.On every table there was a bottle of their homemade BBQ sauce. It was more of a vinegar base, a little too tangy but that's just my own taste. The staff was super efficient. The guy who took my order, I think was one of the owners. He was super personable and really seemed to care about how things were going, how I liked my food and really thanked me for coming in. For my meal, I wanted to try a few things. Here's what I got:. . Half slab of beef ribs, 2 bones, for $15.99. This Smokin Plate came with a side, I chose collard greens, corned bread or roll and a drink. The beef ribs were the best beef ribs I've ever had! It literally just fell off the bone, no joke. The rub they used brought so much flavor to the rib! Every bite was juicy, flavorful and packed with smokey goodness. The collard greens were cooked with brisket, had a little spice and vinegar and so good!. . Pulled piggy sandwich for $7.99. **There's a Yelp special when you check in** Every sandwich purchase comes with a free dessert. I chose the peach cobbler (usually for $3.99). The pulled pork sandwich was made with chopped pork, not finely shredded. I loved that because the meat had some depth to it. It was served on a hot dog bun which was different but seemed to work! The corn bread side was buttery and moist, probably the best corn bread I've ever had! I made a comment that my grandma's corn bread was unbelievable but this one gave my grandma's bread a run for it's money (Sorry grandma!).  As my free dessert, the peach cobbler was gooey and filled with chunks of peaches. . . I must say, this is THE BEST BBQ joint in Las Vegas, hands down. I've had a few BBQ joints here before but nothing compares to Rollin Smoke. This place really does a great job at serving great food. When I'm here, it's just good ole country fun. Looking around the dining area, every party seemed to have a huge smile on their face. I've been to lots of places down south, from Nashville, to Louisville, to Charlotte. BBQ joints different where every go but when you're in Las Vegas, you REALLY need to get your butts down here. You will NOT be disappointed!
I had brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. The brisket was so super chewy, the rib was far from juicy and tender, the pulled pork was better cooked but had lots of sinew in it. The bbq was probably the worst i have had it cooked. My wife had the catfishplate which was good. The bbq flavors were good just needed more love on the cooking side along with some care not to serve chunks of things people cant eat in there pork
I go to vegas quite often for business.  Because most of my associates are turning in their expenses for reimbursement, they opt for the fancy expensive hotel restaurants.  Me?  although i love a juicy $50 steak someone else is paying for, when i spend my own money, i love to find treasures like RSB.. . A hole in the wall that you need to travel off strip for in the industrial district, but, ROLLIN SMOKE BARBEQUE is well worth the effort!.  . . The menu is pretty simple but with a wide variety of options.  I asked for a suggestion and was told the brisket and rib plate with slaw.  FABULOUS choice!. . The brisket was tender and thinly sliced.  The subtle smoke flavor was deep in the meat.. . The ribs fell right off of the bone with just the right amount of sauce to compliment the meat.. . The slaw was fresh and spicy and had some corn in it to add to the flavor.. . Team was friendly.  The place was clean.. . If you are looking for a burger, i saw one being delivered to a table that looked incredible.. . If visiting from out of town and want a real treat at an affordable price, go here!
Places is great! Been there almost ten times. Never have I had a bad meal here. The people who own it are good peeps. Also the place is reasonably priced. Hands down best bbq spot in town.
Quite possibly the best rib place I found here in Vegas... While I love other places, not to mention those other places are good... For the price, environment, and service, I definitely will be back here and also continue to being friends... Beef ribs, all kinda of ribs, in fact the whole menu is just bomb...
Hidden in the back streets near the I-15 freeway, this is a true diamond in the rough.  This is the most tender BBQ I've ever had.  They use a dry rub and the focus is not on the BBQ sauce (they only have one type of sauce), but on the taste of the meat.. . Ordered the rib platter special which includes one beef, two spare, and three baby back ribs and one side and drink as recommended by Dusty.  This is a great deal at $17.99 and I could barely finish everything (not to mention that I skipped lunch).  Also, the special lets you try the different types of ribs, just in case you not sure what to order the next time.. . My favorite out of the three is definitely the beef rib.  It's huge, something that you what expect if you were Fred Flintstone.  The meat just falls off the bone, I mean literally.  This is not easy to do, as other beef ribs I've tasted didn't even come close.. . My second choice would be the baby back ribs followed by the spare ribs.. . The service is extremely friendly and helpful, Dusty was very patient and thoroughly explained what he recommends.  Just about everyone asked how my meal was.  It's a sit down but someone would come by to drop off your food by calling out your name.. . Highly recommended, well worth driving to from the Strip or Downtown.
First off, when you get here you wonder if you are the right place. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and it isn't in the safest of places (late at night). But once you walk in, you are greeting with a delicous smell of BBQ and walls of true Razorback fans! The inside is completely different the outside. This place is true BBQ. Everything was fantastic and the owner is really, really nice. We all got something different and there wasn't one back thing. I got the beef ribs which were literally fall off the bone. We also got the smoked meatloaf and pulled piggy sandwich. The piggy sandwich was very tender and moist but the star of the meals really was the meatloaf. I don't like meatloaf but I liked this one. It isn't your traditional meatloaf, it is smoked and BBQ. So very good. The portions are huge as well! You really don't need too many sides if any but if you do get some, the greens are good, yams and mac n cheese are good! I bet the rest are as well. I highly recommend going here! Yum!
This is a real hidden treat off the strip. When you walk in, you order at a podium then sit either inside or out at big picnic tables. The food is brought out to you fast and is delicious. We ordered the Outlaw Burger, the beef ribs and sides of greens and cornbread. The burger (which is HUGE)  is made of brisket and is topped with cabbage slaw, fried onion strings, chipotle aioli, lettuce and tomato and was perfectly cooked. The beef ribs come with two bones and are Flintstone size. They have the perfect amount of char and completely fall off the bone. The greens are cooked with brisket instead of bacon or ham and are well worth adding on as a side if not included with your meal choice. The cornbread was a little sweet for our taste but certainly good. Prices are very reasonable. As new residents of Las Vegas, we will definitely be back.
This a review on the second time around. The first I went food and service was great the owner (who I believed to be) made sure we were fully satisfied. The second time however the service was ABSOLTUTELY HORRID. They took over an hour to bring out our food. The entire time they never put our order in due to horrible miscommunication that the server made us feel as if it was our fault! The guy even had an attitude. One of the mgrs on duty tried to offer banana pudding  without even knowing i dont like bananas. I even noticed him having some of his thumb in another customers dessert while he dropped it off! So all in all because of the food itself I round up 3.5 to 4. Hopefully the next time we wont have such horrible experience because it is so hard to find great BBQ in Vegas.
We ate here for the first time after hearing how great it was.I can't wait to go back.We ordered the 4 meat 3 side plate for $19.95.Great way to sample the food.Practically licked my fingers after we ate, it was that tasty.You must be patient as there is a line to order usually.All of the food we ate tasted fresh though.Great ribs and meats Worth a try and you will want more.
Just went to this place today...since quite a few ppl said it's the BOMB thought we'd try it... we ordered 2 duo plates: ribs/chkn w/collard greens & brisket/pork w/maccheese ...not sure if our expectations are too high but, we're totally disappointed. Portions are way better than Dickeys BBQ but the sides/meat are cold/bland. The sauce us good though... btw doesn't taste/or looked like it came right of the grill either should have taken a picture before we tossed them... and, we called our orders in 15-20 minutes early... still had to wait extra 15 minutes when we got there... just not "THE BOMB" BBQ that everyone has been telling us. We spent $23+ for the 2 combo plates. Southern Pines North Carolina Dickeys BBQ has been the best for us. Sorry for the negative review but I had to tell the truth. I'm sure you'll find my review with the rest of NOT so good reviews.
This place was incredible!!! I like my BBQ with the sauce on the side so that I can taste the meat. The brisket was tasty, the pulled pork was great, and the ribs were outstanding. I saw an AYCE anything of the menu for $24.95. That could be dangerous for me....
We ordered brisket, hot links, pulled pork, kickin beans, jalapeno coleslaw, fried okra, & cornbread. Every single thing I ate was delicious. The brisket & pulled pork basically melt in your mouth. The hot links were the perfect amount of spicy. The jalapeno coleslaw had was a great mix of spicy sweet. I enjoyed every last bite and I could go on for days about the corn bread. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I've had such delicious mouth watering moist cornbread. Stop reading this & just go...go now!!
Holy cow talk about BBQ this place is awesome. It was my first time there and it was packed and now I know why. Food is excellent. Service is good. The meats are amazing had the brisket, chicken, beef ribs, Mac and cheese, salad etc....oh and the corn bread the best I ever had.
Oh man. BBQ. A touchy subject for many. A food I feel like I'd only have once a month. When the urge comes calling, this is where I'll be.. . Most important thing about Rollin' Smoke is the way they'll take care of you. These are some great people who care about the food they're making and your happiness when you walk out. With that said, I'll jump into what we had.. . - The Outlaw burger. I think calling this the best burger in Vegas is grossly inaccurate. I suspect there is actually better on the menu (which I'll have to try soon). The burger patty itself was huge and delicious. The toppings did not do the patty justice. Basically, a colossal pile of sliced cabbage and onion rings. Great as a side, no justice as a burger topping. But hey, that's just me.. . - The pulled pork and chicken with bacon wrap. This is my favorite thing here! Soft meats, juicy, and easy to handle. I loved this. So much savory flavor! Very satisfying. The tortilla-like wrap it's in might be grilled a bit as it was a bit greasy.. . - The trio, with brisket, ribs, and chicken. All three meats were very well seasoned. Loved all the flavors. The brisket was lean, good marbling, but dry. The ribs were large and juicy. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and still juicy.. . - Chicken a la carte. Hey, it's chicken! Good flavor and perfectly cooked, as I mentioned.. . - Side of beans. So good! Not too sweet or overspiced. I'm a sucker for good BBQ beans.. . - Side of mashed potatoes. These were tasty and filled with little extras like bacon and greens. A bit overspiced.. . - Berry cobbler (included for free with Yelp checkin at the time!). This was an unexpected delight. I expected a dessert packed full of sugar. What I got was just the right touch of sugar in a genuinely home-made tasting piece of cobbler.  Great crust and flavorful berries without intense sweetness. This is a good item to share with a lot of people.. . I'm definitely going to be back to try another burger but until then... this will be the only BBQ I go to when the craving strikes.
Haven't had BBQ this good since we lived in Texas!   3 meat platter was super tasty- got brisket , pork , and ribs.  Side plates were great.  . . The clientele was all locals; it's a little ways off the strip. No frills but a fantastic meal.. . My only complaint is they don't serve beer .
amazing food and service. the price for desert is a little bit much but i got it for free with my check in. never knew this place was here.
Hole in the wall kind of place but nice and full of picnic tables. Incredible BBQ and BBQ sauce. Everything was excellent. Probably the top five BBQ I've had. . Friendly staff. No Alcohol sold there. Did I mention the food was great? This is a definite place I would use if needing to use for catering.
Absolutely delicious.  I wasn't sure about it when we pulled in at 830 on a Friday night but the second I walked in the door, I was greeted by the aroma of the sweet sent of BBQ. Pit Special is what was ordered and nothing of it was a disappointment.  I am pleased to recommend Rollin Smoke Barbecue to anyone looking for great cooking, mouth watering food.
This place loves hot spicy flavor!. . I ordered a platter with ribs and pulled pork. It came with toast and a choice of side. I was hard pressed to find a side that wasn't spicy - jalapeno coleslaw and kickin' beans?! They let me substitute cornbread, and it was the best dang cornbread I've eaten in my life. So fluffy, so moist, so delicate, so smooth and sweet. Next time I need double corn bread! The ribs didn't have much of a smoke ring, but the smoke wasn't lacking and the rub was good. The sauce is spicy, but a perfect amount. The most impressive thing was when I asked for butter, they served me a container of warm melty butter, YUM!. . My husband got brisket, which was kind of dry, but the seasoning was great, and it was perfectly salted. The loaded mashed potatoes were awesome, as if they mashed it using some of the bacon grease from the topping - so yummy.. . Even my kid's food was good. The hot dog was a fat juicy meaty delicious thing, and he got hush puppies or corn nugget things that I couldn't stop stealing. The only thing he didn't like was that the cheese he ordered was spicy nacho cheese. No surprise.. . This place is better than Dickeys, Road Kill Grill, and Famous Dave's, but Lucille's still takes the cake.
Ordered a brisket sandwich and an order of baby back ribs and two drinks for 33 bucks. Over priced for the quality of the food. My order was to go and we ate the food about 15 minutes receiving the food. . . Brisket sandwich was horrible. It was so dry that I couldn't take more that 2 bites. Waffle fries were stale hard and cold. The baby back ribs we're ok but cold and they forgot the side item I ordered. Will never go back.
Finally, real BBQ in las vegas! If you havent been here you better make the trip! I've been to Franklins and Salt Lick in Austin and this is just as good.
Beef ribs. Got the full rack. Delicious and huge! Wife had the outlaw burger and it was very good as well. Will definitely be back
Going to make this brief and will update after I eat here a second time. Which will happen. . . This is really good BBQ. Not great but a heck of a lot better than good. . . Pork Ribs - 4 star . Pulled Pork - 3 star . Brisket 2.5 star . Beef Rib 4 star . . So I recommend everything but the brisket was lacking a bit. Like I said just good. . . I enjoyed the hushpuppies, corn fritters, bbq beans . . Had both the Peach Cobbler and Banana Pudding and enjoyed both. . . I will write a more detail review soon as this place isn't great but it is really good and probably the best you will get in Vegas. And some of the food does almost get to the great line.. . As well looks like Review 200 was my favorite BBQ Joint and Review 250 is a BBQ joint that just missed making my top 10. To be fair it is fierce competition.
The food was good but service was questionable. Found a hair in my hot dog and the manager asked me what should he do and lied about not having someone with long hair. I ordered dessert and a worker with long hair brought my dessert out. The manager offered $5 in cash on my $60 bill. Never coming back
I cant believe I keep forgetting to review this place! This is by far the best bbq I have ever had. Yes the location is questionable. Yes the restaurant itself could use some work. But the food... The food is incredible. The ribs are huge. The sandwiches are huge. The loaded mash side is delicious. The banana pudding is to die for. Get over there now and eat!
Well this confirmed I should have rounded down instead of up after last time.  I think this place probably has its good days and not asgood days.  Today was a down day and the 1st time was a better day.  I was at a 3.5 after the 1st time and gave it a 4, today it earned it's three.  . . Had the rib combo 3 baby back,  2 spare, 1 beef. The beef rib came out sauced,  I didn't expect that as it didn't last time.  I sent it back and asked for one without sauce. When I got the plate back it was the same rib with sauce rubbed off. This was highly irritating. Wonder what else was done to my food while it was sent back.  I don't dare to let my mind wonder that road.  I should have been served a new rib that had never been sauced.  Not one that was wiped off. Sigh, urg, I seem to be more upset about this the more I think about it. The beef rib was good this time not as good as the 1st time.  The baby backs were better than the spare but both were underdone as neither pulled away from the bone easy and were kinda tough, even though they had good flavor. Definitely not as good as the 1st time. . . The 1st time I also had the brisket which was above average but not great.  Also had pulled pork that was pretty good.  . . All the meats here do have varying degrees of a Smokey taste,  as well varying degrees of smoke rings.  So they are cooking these meats with the right methods. .  . For sides I have enjoyed the corn nuggets and fritters both times, but I am not sure if these are not just prepackaged items instead of homemade. . . Last but not least the desserts. I had the berry cobbler today.  I would definitely stay away from this item as it wasn't very good.  Ordering the peach cobbler and banana pudding seem like your safest and tastiest bets for dessert. . . In summary if this was my 1st time it would be my last time. Still can't believe I didn't get a fresh rib instead they just wiped it off. If this would have been my 1st time they would have been 2 stars based just on that fact alone. Not sure if I will stop back in here or not.  On a good day they are the best in the area. (Really no good bbq in Vegas, so thats not saying much (though I have one that just popped on my radar that I need to try), ). On a bad day well it is just okay. . . Your milage may vary.
The food was ok at best and a bit pricey.  The location of the restaurant is in industrial area off the strip and small.  Even though the restaurant is small there is plenty of room to sit comfortably.  The staff was ok but the food does take a while be brought out.  The restaurant has an offer on Yelp for a free desert if you check in.... make sure you let them know prior to finishing your order if not they will not honor it.  I told the gentleman at the register just as he gave me my total and another guy who was standing behind him said I should have told them earlier.  He made no attempt to honor the offer he just waited for my payment.
I usually question a place so close to a strip club, but the food was so awesome. Had the duo meat plate with brisket, ribs and mashed potatoes.  Yeah a real fat boy meal but I was starving. The brisket was very tender and tasty,  complemented by their super good bbq sauce that you should make sure you get more of. Ribs were also very tender. Not fall off the bone tender since the skin is cooked rather well but remains juicy. My favorite part of the meal though was the mash. Not to take away from other parts of the meal, this was just that garlicky, bacon infused, cheesyness good. Def worth it.
I have tried this place 2x so far...  The first time was about 9 months ago..  I thought it was just good a place that i dont mind going to...On that occasion i ordered a half rack of ribs, mac and cheese, mashed and 2 beef ribs..  I thought it was good... . I went here recently with a friend of mine.. This time I ordered the meatloaf.. It was absolutely the best meatloaf i have ever had EVER... Cheesecake factory has a version of this but it does not even compare to this... It sat on top of a bed of mashed potatoes with this bbq gravy,, topped with onion straws..  I believe they smoke the meatloaf... Whatever they do,, I am a big fan... It was one of those meals that you will remember..  My friend got the outlaw burger,, He really liked it and it was impressive when it was brought out...  It looked like a mess to eat,, but looked good..  The desserts are decent but this meatloaf was slap your mother good...  Hope this Yelps. . . 11/232014. It was about 11pm,,, i was really craving bbq,,  I remembered that Roling Smoke was open late... I ordered the rib combo... Lets just say dont come here for a late night meal,, at least this night...  All 3 meats were bone dry,, i asked for extra sauce,, but it wasnt  in my order,,, the sides were good,, but the berry cobbler,, seemed old... I have to admit it was after 11 but wow what a disappointment... I had to remove a star,,   I will try them when i think the meats would be freshest... Remember based on my experience,, I will not eat here again after 7 pm on a weekend...
Wow this place takes the cake for best hospitality. It is rare nowadays to find a good place with superb service and have the most amazing food. This place takes care of you like family! . On to the food:. The corn fritters... OMG! Can I say a party in my mouth?!!! I could probably eat these forever or until I get a heart attack. I was never one for corn fritters but this totally converted me! . The outlaw burger: totally agree with reviews of having the best burger in vegas. Prepare to share as the portions are huge! Or don't share and keep it all to yourself  . Will definitely be back for this place. Thanks for an amazing experience!
Rollin smoke catered a 150+ resident pool party for Sky Las Vegas Condos. Amazing, everyone loved the food. Chef Tim, his crew were on point and everything was served hot, fresh and absolutely delicious! I had so many people tell me "this is their new favorite bbq" We will be using them again!!
I cannot wait to go back! The food was awesome! I had the brisket and chicken which had great Smokey flavor and wasn't smothered in sauce.  The prices are reasonable and there are a lot menu items to choose from.  My roommate got the burger and enjoyed it.
I actually signed up to write reviews just because of this delicious BBQ place!  This little BBQ joint is legit southern style great BBQ.  First off, it's not a real BBQ place until it has fried okra as a side and this place delivers on that as well as so many things.  Sweet Tea, yep it's effin delicious too.  The meat we had as our dinner were- ribs (fall off the bone when you pick them up) brisket (tender and it's got that gorgeous pink smoke ring and amazing flavor) and smoked sausage (has just the right amount of spice too it!) sides- okra and mac n cheese.  We are from Oklahoma and miss the craft and care that goes into smoking and creating amazing BBQ but we don't have to miss it anymore!  Service is amazing and friendly and we plan on taking our friends and family that visit us!  Thanks to the staff for the warm welcome and friendly atmosphere, seriously can't wait to come back and next time I'm going to have the berry cobbler too!
On the way back from Zion we stopped at Rollin Smoke BBQ, it was easy to get to off the freeway and soooo good! The beef ribs were incredible, like one dreams about. Good portion size and a nice low key atmosphere with a couple of different seating areas. Will be back!
This was our first time going here to this restaurant which was really good. The burgers and brisket are highly recommended. Not too crispy and not too chewy, it was a great BBQ meal. To top it off, put the delicious barbecue sauce on it. The prices were not high either for such great tasting food. Service was quick and helpful. Overall a fantastic place for lunch or a group dinner.
Two words: freakin' awesome. If you love BBQ this is a must. A little out of the way but worth the drive/cab ride. You will not find such awesomeness on the strip...and super reasonable prices. Their burger was amazing-it was actually smoked! Their banana pudding was simply perfect. I have never had a better one and I'm a bit of a banana pudding addict. Just go- you will be so happy you did!
Oh man this place has delicious ribs the meat falls right off and they have this tangy/hot sauce so yummy with the meat. We got some sides with our meal mac and cheese and mashed potatoes I wasn't impressed they didn't have any flavor and the mashed potatoes were room temperature, that's why I gave them 4 stars.
What a disappointment! I have to wonder about the validity of all the positive reviews.. . Great service? It's literally nonexistent.. . I had beef ribs and one of them was 95 percent fat. The barbecue sauce tasted putrid for want of a better word, like it was unrefrigerated for a long time.. . We split a four meat platter as well and nothing about it was in any way remarkable. My wife commented that the ribs at the Gold Coast buffet are better, and I agree.. . She ordered onion laces and they were just a pile of greasy limpness. I wish we would have taken a picture.. . This place is nothing more than mediocre at best. Don't believe the hype on here. Plus, it is nearly impossible to find.
Baby back ribs, slab, pulled pork, all smoked to perfection. The beef ribs were a little dry. . . I like very saucey BBQ meats and this isn't what they serve. Their sauce is thin, not over-powering. If you like good, dry rubs or just good meat, eat here. . . So many options to pick from! I wanted to try the wings, brisket, bacon potato salad, burger, onion rings.... . It may be worth it to starve yourself for a day to get all you can eat for $25. . . Really cool vibe! Picnic benches indoors, simple podium to order from, really enjoyed it!
Toller unscheinbarer Laden mit exzellentem BBQ ! Wer also nach einem richtigen BBQ sucht ist hier absolut richtig - Wir hatten den Ribs teller mir Babyribs, normale Ribs und Rinder Ribs... sehr geil !  fur meinen Geschmack war das Ganze vielleicht einen Tick zu rauchig - mag aber auch daran liegen das wir in Deutschland nichts vergleichbares haben und es einfach nicht gewohnt sind - deshalb 4/5
I was really looking forward to trying this spot, I had it in my bookmarks forever! But unfortunately my mind wasn't quite as blown as I had expected. Perhaps I didn't do enough yelp researching to make an educated order. I got the pulled pork and hotlinks with mac and cheese and the corn fritters. The pulled pork and corn fritters were really good, and I love there bbq sauce, but I really didn't care for the hot links or mac n cheese. I do want to go back and try some of the more recommended items. . . To end on a high note, their customer service and hospitality was awesome! This place is kind of located in a sketchy area so I have to admit I was a little intimidated walking in for the first time, but everyone was super welcoming and friendly.
