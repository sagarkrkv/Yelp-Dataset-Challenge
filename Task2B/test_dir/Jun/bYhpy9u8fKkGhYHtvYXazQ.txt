Paris hotel has a somewhat okay feel to it though I have experienced a much better time at other hotel and casino on the strip. The wifi charge is ridiculous. Purchased the king suite and it is super small on the 12th floor with a crummy view of a bally's alleyway. The noise on this side of the building are very loud on the weekend after hours due to the drai's rooftop club boom bass echoing through the buildings room adjacent to the Paris hotel on this side. The main pro to this Paris hotel is the location it sits on the strip.
We didn't stay here, regretfully, however they have a beautiful mall on the main level just past the casino.  Salons, eateries, jewelers, Swarovski, shoe stores, souvenir stores abound.  It was a delight to just walk through and take it in.
Great place to stay if you're on a tight budget, the location is perfect. Yet, I wouldn't recommend it if you're like me and enjoy top notch service, spotless hallways, fresh, new and well appointed rooms. . . The Paris is situated in a sought out location at the heart of the strip where most of the action happens - right across the street from the beautiful Bellagio Lake and fountains, and a hop and a skip to the Planet Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan and The Aria. . . The rooms are clean, but dated and a little worn down - same could be said about the amenities. The furniture were scratched and look like they've seen better days. The plumbing system is deteriorating and smelled like chemicals and mold when it got wet. It was rather an offensive and migraine inducing smell. I wouldn't dare take my flip flops off when walking around on the carpet, it felt hard and starchy, quite possibly dirty. I didn't want to risk it. . . House keeping did not stay on top of keeping the guest hallway floors tidy or fresh. There was an old room service orange juice glass that was stained and a nasty coffee cup filled half way, that was dried out and crusted from sitting in the hallway for 3 days straight. Very disgusting. We even saw the manager patrol the hallway and she didn't look twice at the nasty crusted cups on the floor.. . The guest parking is completely hidden in the back of the casino (up a ramp). It's quite a maze to get back there, but it's our favorite place to park when we want to walk to the Bellagio or enjoy the strip. Concierge at the Paris was rather rude and quick to get rid of us. The older man with gray hair was crabby and not welcoming.. . Mon Ami Gabi is one of our top places in Vegas to eat. The food there is incredible. The prices aren't too shabby either, very reasonable! The best seats are on the patio overlooking the Bellagio lake and fountain. It's a must for me to dine here frequently. Enjoy~
My boyfriend and I stayed here and enjoyed it. The room decor is cute/French inspired, the lobby decor is really tacky. We got a good deal through the Caesars Total Rewards Club for 2 nights on a weekend. We loved the Eiffel Tower observation deck tour and the Eiffel Tower margaritas outside. We even saw a couple get proposed there! Definitely not as good as the real Paris but a cute, romantic place for couples to stay. Super convenient location in the middle of the Strip across from the Bellagio fountains (we could watch them go off from our room's window).
We got a slick deal using Southwest Vacations and I was very impressed! We had a view of the pool, Bellagio fountain, and Paris Balloon. While it isn't the most fancy hotel, it is a step above many others on the strip. And to top it off, it's smack dab in the middle of all the action. We spent a lot of our time over at the Bellagio and Aria which were right across the street :P Overall--a great experience.
First: I made our rez online and didn't realize that checkin was at 4pm! If you wanted to checkin early, there would be a service fee. Secondly, the checkin lines were HORRIBLE! We waited at least 40 minutes in line and they had only 5 counters opened. I could see the manager come out and see how things were going several times, and didn't even consider to open another line. The set up with the tv and frig was strange. The wifi was free, but for only one device. And if you wanted to add another device, it would cost $14.99. They offered us a strip view room for an extra $40. Skipped it. The swimming pool was great and the Eiffel Tower added some much needed shade in the 109* day we had.
Thought $42 a night with a $25 food and beverage coupon was a bargain, but not so. First there is the mandatory $20 "resort fee" for the fitness center and one-device-only wifi. Then there are no complimentary toothbrush/toothpaste which means going to the gift shop and paying an arm and a leg for what would normally be a free amenity at most hotels. Finally, the restaurants in the hotel are so overpriced the food and beverage coupon basically equals to a free sandwich.  Oh, and the ATM fee is $6.. . Not planning to return for a stay here anytime soon.
I give the Paris good marks purelyfor its location on the strip.   Rooms are nice and kept clean with good quality bath aids and rooms come with mini coffee makers to help hangovers.  Food options are a let down but the advantage of its location makes this a non issue.  Can't win in the casino and sound system is bad with dancers on tables at night...Planet next door as dancers with better sound system and better odds of good luck plus its a three minute walk to get there from Paris.  Caesars and City Center are across the street and only takes a few to walk there for convenience.  The gym is very basic with just enough to keep you focused on trying to be good on vacation with two bikes and about eight treadmills.    Spa at Paris is very small with towels being even smaller(hand towel) but offers steam,sauna, and the hot tub.   The theory is to be relaxed and naked and it works if you have the place to yourself which is typical until some young fit guy or some creepy old guycomes into one on the areas wearing swim trunks making you feel uncomfortable about properly using the spa.  Best advice is to just forget about them and just be free to relax the way it was intended.   Amateur spa patrons obviously dont get the idea of separate spa areas for all men and another for all women.  Taxi service is quick and never have to wait but valet does take a few minutes if they too busy.  I never have to pay to stay at Paris but they do charge me a resort fee of around $22 a day so I use the gym and spa to justify the expense.
So far not impressed :(. Wanted to stay here for Sooo many years. We are here with a large group of family to celebrate a 21st bday. First off the lady who checked us in was so rude. AND checking in at 2pm they charge $15! I've been coming to Vegas my whole life and this has NEVER happened, really?? On top of the $20 resort fee?? Really? And the lady could care less. Our second room couldn't be on the same floor either. Oh could we get a view? $30 bucks. Now to the room...old, dingy, bathroom run down with hard water crusted around the shower. I'm shocked and disappointed so far :(.
This was my first time staying here and unfortunately it was disappointing. We arrived late on a Friday and our room preferences were not available anymore. The room we got (smoking and queen beds, total opposite of what we asked for) was so old and gross, I couldn't believe how crappy it was. The carpet was badly worn and there were rust stains like they moved a rusty piece of furniture and of course it reeked of smoke. We were told that we would be getting an upgrade the next day so we dealt with it. The next day the lady gave me a hard time about honoring the upgrade but with a little persistence and remembering the guy who promised us the night before's name, we were moved from the 4th floor to the 30th, that room was a million times nicer so that's why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2. The weekend rates were very high, weekday rates were very good except you have to add on the rip-off resort fee every day which is to use the gym? and have wifi for one device, dumb.. . The casino is pretty and the smoke isn't too bad there compared to others but I could not afford the table games there. I had no luck on the slots there and did not like their machines much. I gambled at other casinos instead.. . The layout was confusing for us, we got lost several times trying to find the player's club and looking for quick serve places to eat, we ended up at Bally's somehow.. . The pool was ok. It was pretty but not enough shade, one side was too much shade and the rest was extremely sunny. I heard it was $15 for a drink, so I did not even try to order anything there. You can't bring your own food or drinks as far as I understood, even water supposedly.. . Le Cafe was a great place for the prix fixe chicken lunch. Best meal during our trip was here. It's in the middle of the casino under the fake clouds. . . We went up to the Eiffel Tower at night, it was amazing. I mentioned we were hotel guests and our tickets went way down in price, it was awesome. . . Mon Ami Gabi was just ok. The steak was tough and disappointing. I'd like to go sometime for breakfast and eat outside. Would not go back for lunch.. . The quick breakfast place we tried was only fair. Our breakfast sandwiches were cold and the eggs tasted fake. Orange juice was like $5 and so was water.. . Le Village Buffet used to be our favorite breakfast buffet but this time it was underwhelming.. . I doubt I would ever stay here again. So I guess we won't always have Paris.
When you are inside this hotel the air seems much cleaner than even most of the more expensive hotels.  Sure there is cigarette smoke, because like all casinos in Vegas they don't want to cut back on their most valuable customers, those who have addictive personalities.  However,  the ceilings are very high, an the casino and rooms have good, filtered ventilation.   I prefer cigarette smoke unmasked to the thick, oily perfumes that many of the other casino/hotels in Vegas use.  . . There may be some rooms that have not been renovated yet, but ours was very new, clean and nicely equipped with a small refrigerator.. . The breakfast buffet at Paris is really nice.  They will make fresh crepes to order and the decor is so charming you don't even feel like you are in a Vegas buffet.. . We left our dirty clothes in our room, and Becky in lost and found was very helpful in sending our things to us.  I am not sure how much it cost to do that yet, because I trusted her with my credit card.  However, I was surprised to get my things Fed Exed to me the very next day.. . Overall, it was a very nice stay for a very reasonable price.
They do not offer free wifi, you have to pay for it! Boooo. Nice restaurants and pool though!
The online bargain wasn't worth the wait just to check in! We have been standing in line for over 30 minutes and I am maybe halfway there. At least at a restaurant theytell you the wait time and you can decide to wait or not. With a hotel reservation, you are a captive audience. Never again here at this hotel.
Having read the reviews on this place, I was expecting the long line upon check in.  It did however, move fairly quickly for how shockingly long it was.  Before entering the perilous journey, we opted not to go for valet parking and hoof our own bags in (which was actually no problem).  We made the decision only after we were in the queue because we wanted to have the car detailed; the attendant informed my partner we would be relegated to the plebeian self park area because the detailer isn't allowed in the valet area.  The actual attempt to get out of the queue and into traffic was perhaps the most emotional part about the trip, since humanity seems to have been replaced by big, fat road rage monsters driving SUVs, not letting anyone in and honking at everything as though they took a vacation to Manhattan.. . We get to the counter; the woman informs me the $40 deal has me in a smoking room automatically because I didn't indicate otherwise.  I know I specifically requested non-smoking.  She tells us the only other place is facing the dance floor and we will hear the music all night... Or she can upgrade me.  For a price.  It's the Red Room in a corner.  Supposedly newly remodeled wing.  Overall she was friendly and efficient; however, thinking about a lot of this, I don't buy that my non smoking room didn't go through.  I don't believe the only other one available is on the loudest floor.  (Is there an up-sell contest going on?). . The room:. At first glance it's spacious, and the views seem ok.  But where is the Eiffel Tower?  Not on our side.  We have a lovely view of the car park out both windows.  Also as we explore our room, we discover the maids seem to just make the beds and perform a cursory wipe down of the sinks.  There are hand prints on the windows, dust all over, and the bath tub is too grimey for it to be a "recently remodeled wing".  I've also had more comfortable pillows at a Holiday Inn.  These are lumpy and seem to be here just for show.  Not a great night's sleep.. . Gambling:. Stick with bottled beer; the "mixed drinks" are so watered down it's not even worth it.  The gaming floor is so cold I couldn't stay on the floor to spend my money.  Isn't that the point?  Will go elsewhere to game.. . Food:. We ate at Gordon Ramsay Steak House -400$ for two not including tip. -make a reservation. -if you don't have a reservation the bar is first come, first served.. . Have eaten at the Eiffel Tower Twice Before:. - 250-500$ for two before tip . - does not participate in the total rewards card points.. - reserved over opentable.com - the first time the specific table request was honored; the second time it was not.. - the best table is the corner window. . - amazing, rich food. . Don't bother with the cafes for food. . . Attitude:. The staff is nice, even though the amenities aren't that great.  From the car attendant to the wait staff in the cafe,  (Just go for coffee) the employees were always polite.
This isn't a five star hotel, but the value was good for what we paid. The hotel room was quiet and well air-conditioned. They upgraded us to a suite when only a smoking room was available.
Walk thru the doors strip side and the Casino smells like a sewer. I can't even stand the smell to gamble or even imagine ordering a drink. Good luck, you need announce a public explanation. OMG.
