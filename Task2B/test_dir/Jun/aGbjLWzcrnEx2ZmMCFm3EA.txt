Gordon Ramsay BURGR is a fun modern style twist on the classic hamburger joint (think 50's diner with modern detail). Location is superb at the entrance to Planet Hollywood, which as hotel/casino environments go is very approachable but also not so upscale. . . The restaurant has an awesome fire feature and the design aspects are very cool. Restaurant was open 11am-2am and we walked in around 1:00am to grab a delicious bite.. . As it go's with many places in Vegas, acquiring quality skilled talent is a challenge. This may explain the weak reception at the front desk, where it took three young staffers to figure out how to get us a table. . . On approach, one smiled and acknowledged us, the other stared blankly at me, and the third was ought-right arrogant and totally self absorbed. . . Most restaurants forget that the hostess is the face of the restaurant, the first place you make contact, and it sets the tone for the experience. So load up on quality talent in this key role, would be my advice for this and all restaurants looking to make a good first impression. . But once we got past that none sense, the experience was very good.. . Our server was great, the Hell's Kitchen burger with avocado and Asadero cheese was a really cool combo.. . The fries and onion rings come with chipotle Ketchup, and there's also a curry Ketchup that gives an Indian hint to the other seasonings and flavors.. . Good food, good location, fun concept. Staff works hard, is eclectic and funky, but hostesses should be recruited from somewhere where there's an actual motivation to be working as opposed to an entitled sense of inconvenience for having to seat you.. . If you're walking the strip late night or hungry during the day, stop here for one of the BURGR's
Get the farm burger and truffle fries!. ------------/-------------. . After dropping some serious coinage at Encore beach club (see accompanying review), we decided to find a restaurant on the Strip that wouldn't break the bank, but also wasn't Subway. . . I found this place on Yelp and they did not steer me wrong!. . First things first - it is located inside Planet Hollywood. So if you enter from the Miracle Mile shops on Las Vegas Blvd, be prepared to walk across the casino floor.. . Also, be aware that the line is only for party of two. If you have a group larger than that, YOU DO NOT NEED TO WAIT IN LINE. Just simply go to the hostess, and give her your cellphone number. She will text you when table is ready. . . As for the food:. - pork belly Bao: the pork was closer to Chinese Char Siu (firm, not tender). Soft & sweet bun, like those you get when you eat Peking duck. . - farm burger: GET THIS. This is a perfectly cooked burger (medium = medium), with a soft potato-type roll, toasted bun, and topped with a fried egg with a yolk that runs with the first bite. Awesome burger. . - truffle fries: double fried steak fried topped with Parmesan cheese and served with two sauces--an aioli as well as a near ketchup. The best part is the Bloody Mary mix that serves the base of this sauce. . . Strong work, Mr. Ramsay!
Best burger in town! I have been here numerous times and it never gets old.
My boyfriend had the Hells Kitchen burger and I had the chantrelle burger added fontina cheese, truffle fries, sweet potato fries, Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pops. Everything was amazing and perfect! Wouldn't expect less for Gordon Ramsey...
Went to Las Vegas with my husband and we had to try Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. Didn't take long to find as it immediately inside to the left of the Planet Hollywood entrance. The line was long, but did move fairly quickly. Food was very flavorful and really hit the spot. To cap the evening off, we met Christina Wilson (former winner of Hell's Kitchen). Very exciting night for me as she was kind enough to take a photo with me. As for my husband, his only complaint was that he asked for a Jack n Coke but ended up with a Jack n Pepsi. According to him, big difference. The server was kind enough to replace his cocktail with another option.. . Looking forward to the next visit. Highly recommended.
Waited 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night, which wasnt too bad. Ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, Chanterelle burger, and truffle parmesan fries. Burgers were okay. Nothing too special. The fries tasted like garlic fries served at San Francisco Giants baseball games. Good experience but wouldnt come back again based on the prices.
Wow, just wow! This place is amazing! Gordon Ramsay delivers with this restaurant. The whole experience was awesome, from the time you put your name on the wait list, order drinks, get your delicious food, and then leave satisfied! . . They have a cool wait list system. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Very convenient! . . When we got seated we ordered our drinks. I got a Mike's hard black cherry lemonade and it was so dang good! My boyfriend got a "draught" (that's how the restaurant spells it) Redds Apple Ale that was also just as good!. . We ordered the farm burger and American burger both medium well. We also ordered sweet potato fries and regular fries. Wow it was all so good! My farm burger had duck bacon and and over medium egg on it. The duck bacon was so amazing! I have never even heard of duck bacon but I loved it! And the egg added amazing flavor too! My boyfriends american burger was great too! He loved the pickles. He said it had the best pickles he has ever tasted! The meat was cooked perfect as well. The sweet potato fries were bomb! I was in love with them. The regular fries were good because they came with a really good dipping sauce.. . We were so excited to try this place and it delivered! When I go back to Vegas it will be a go to place every time!
Excellent hog and cod burger with fries. Blood Orange Cosmo was excelled and very cold. Great service and our waiter Michael was fantastic.
After looking forward to eating here I finally got a chance! However, the meal was decent, but a bit over-hyped for me.. . We arrived at around 9.30 PM on a Friday night, and for a table of 10, we were seated about 30-45 minutes later. I thought the decor was nice, it was kept to a minimum, but still classy, especially with the cool fire display near the entrance. Service was pretty friendly, helpful, and patient! I split the Farm Burger and a hot dog with my boyfriend. . . The Farm burger was served with cheese, strips of bacon and a couple over easy eggs, nothing on the sides. First bite was pretty good, oozy with the egg, and the meat was tender and blended with the bacon. But other than that, I thought after a while the BurGR started to get kind of boring, and turned into "just another fancy burger". Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty, just not the best I've ever had.. . The hot dog had a bit more flavor than the burger. Onions and toppings were well made and blended together, the hot dog itself loaded with spices. . . I'm glad I got a taste, but not sure I'll be back a second time unless someone reallyyyy wants me to go with them.
I wasn't a burger person but came for the Gordon Ramsay hype. We had truffle Parmesan fries to begin with, the fries is ordinary but with the truffle aiole sauce it was really good. I got the hill's kitchen burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. The burger was not dry nor greasy. The hint of spiciness from the roasted jalapeno peppers made it so delicious. Brought the whole flavor to another level. I think Gordon is very good with the flavor and the texture of the foods he create. This burger joint was the most surprising meal for me in this trip. . The decoration of the restaurant is very modern and fun. The fire display in the transparent wall with their logo is eye catching. The waiter who served us was very friendly and not seemed hurry even it's busy. It showed professionalism. The only thing I  DONT LIKE about is the servers' uniform. It's a spandex nylon texture denim look top that shows every inch of the person's body. IF the person has a good body shape it will look good but most people don't have perfect shapes so it is not a pretty picture. I think the design was originally made for Gordon or people like him who does ironman triathlon. Anyways. I don't want to continue on this insignificant topic. It's just details I noticed. Overall. It's very good. I'll definitely go again next time I'm in Vegas.
It is very rare that I give out the perfect 5 stars on a review but in all honesty, Gordon Ramsay should be proud of this location, it's staff and the awesome food!  5 stars is definitely deserving!  I was blown away by our server who was one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was in it the while time and a perfect attitude that made me want to come back for more!  Back all that great service up with an unbelievable burger and fixings......and Mr. Ramsay has a winner here!  Big claps, high fives and just an overall wonderful experience!  I couldn't be happier!  I cannot wait to go back and try the chili dog now!  Yum!
We've had the burgers here a couple of visits now and have enjoyed them and the warm hospitality. We've tried the Bleu cheese, hog burger, Euro burger and a few others and they were all excellent. Not too huge, just right sized. Share the Truffle Parm fries and you won't be too bloated to party for the rest of the evening! A nice collection of unusual draught beers as well.
YUM! A big group of my friends were visiting Vegas last weekend, and we all really wanted to try this place. We went on a Saturday, and we didn't make a reservation, so we were really scared that our party of 12 would have to wait a looong wait. We all arrived around 5pm, and we waited for less than 30min for our table! :). . The majority of our group ordered the Farm Burger and we got 4 orders of Truffle Parmesean Fries for our group to share. Fries don't come with the burgers themselves and are sold separately, but one order can definitely be shared by 4 people or so. These fries were really goood. The Farm Burger had duck breast bacon and a fried egg in it. Mm, the bacon was hella good and the egg was perfect! I cut my burger in half, and the egg started to ooze, but it's great with the burger. . . What was also handy was that the bill came with a calculator! Hahaha, that was actually pretty handy for us since we had a big group. So, if you're in Vegas and want a good burger, go here!! Good food, good service and very accommodating.
I'm having a hard time giving BurGR 3 stars.  I love Gordon Ramsey and our apps were very good!  We had the wings (so fun with only the one bone), jalapeno poppers (so spicy!!!), truffle fries, regular fries and onion rings with our burgers.  I loved the truffle fires and one of the best onion rings I've ever had.  But....the wait time to get our food was sooooooooo long and my patty was almost raw.  Like that gross feeling of raw ground meat in your mouth...boo.  And I had the Britania burger but i swear i never tasted the chutney.  oh well.  We came here because my brother and his friend had lunch here the day before and they said their burgers were so good (one of them had the farm burger, I can't remember what the other one was).  But even they weren't as impressed with BurGR the next day.  If I visit again, I think I'll get one of the gorgeously delicious hot dogs I saw passing by.  And I'll make sure I have a bunch of time to kill as i wait around waiting for my food.
My boyfriend and I decided to have an early dinner before a show. This was our first time in Vegas and we were planning on going to all 3 of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. We were seated immediately as there was no line at that time. Our drink order was taken immediately and soon after our food order. That's where everything went down hill. Our server disappeared then another girl approached our table informing us she would be our server for the rest of the meal. Ok, no problem. Three tables who came after us received their appetizers and then their meals before us. We were annoyed so we attempted to flag down any server because we couldn't find ours. First problem, maybe there was a shift change happening, but there were at least 15 servers just standing by the computers talking. Eventually they disperse and we can see our server, but she and three other servers are laughing away with who appears to be the manager. We attempted to flag down other servers and even the manager, but no one stopped. We waited about 10 more minutes before our server approached our table and we informed her that we still haven't received our food. Her response was that it can take 20-30 minutes, but I politely let her know it's been well over 30 minutes since we ordered and other tables have received their food. She lets us know she'll check on it. When she comes back she says they made a mistake with my order and they hadto re-fire it, that's why it's taking awhile. I found that interesting because I had an appetizer as a meal (honey pig bao buns), which is two small pieces of pork that I'm sure that could take 5-10 minutes to cook. When we finally received our food, it was AMAZING!!. . After such a bad experience the first time, we decided to try one more time. This time we had to wait in line, but no more than 15 minutes. Our server this time around was excellent! He was very attentive and even informed us we could keep our menus (which we weren't informed of the first time). Our drinks and our food was served to us promptly (and we arrived at a busier time than the first). When we paid for our meal, the server also gave each of us a Gordon Ramsay Burgr pen for us to keep, again something that wasn't offered the first time.. . The first experience I would rate 1 stars and only because of the food. But with the excellent service and food the second time I decided 3 stars would be fair.
One of the best burgers EVER! . We had an amazing dinner here while staying on the strip. The food was awesome, our waitress Ashley was the best! Started with the jalapeno poppers - yessss! Burgers were perfect in every way, and do not miss the Parmesan truffle fries. Will definitely go back!
Burgers are one of my favorite foods ever. We weren't really planning to come to BurGR but we happened to be near there so we decided to check on how long the wait would be. The wait for a party of 6 would've been 1hr+ but the lady at the counter suggested that we split into 3 tables of 2. That's what we did but the wait was still around 30 minutes. We were actually starving that day because we were walking around the strip after a really really long night. I think it was around 4pm and we haven't eaten anything so we were so hungry. . . This burger definitely hit the spot. It was so good and juicy. I got the farm burger and shared fries with my friend. We were a little too hungry so we weren't as hungry in the end, so we couldn't quite finish the fries. But overall, everything was amazing. The service was really good, our server kept coming back to ask us about our meal and it was really appreciated.
I loved it. The Burgr was delicious, people say expensive, but in PH there is Ketchup or something and the prices are almost the same for regular burgers. . . I love that the Burgr comes out exactly as identified on the menu, I cannot express how annoying it is to order something and then find that it has half a dozen other items added that are not listed. . . Our waiter was great and service was top notch. I will definitely eat here again.
My wife and I decided to hit this joint before going to the airport to catch our flight home.  We ordered the American Burger and the Blue Burger, with fries.  . . The food was excellent.  The dipping sauces for the fries were unique and tasty, and the burgers were very well prepared (and just plain delicious).. . The downside: Service.  Despite being seated within two minutes of arriving, our server appeared very distracted.  After receiving our food (from a person different than our server), she never - and I mean never - came backto check on us to see how we were doing and whether we liked the food.  She only showed up to clear the plates and drop off the bill.  If she had just paid a bit more attention to us, the tip would have been 25% (or more), and not just 15%.. . I wanted to respond to the survey they offered at the time we were paying (to provide feedback on the service), but the device they have for taking the survey (it looked like an iPhone or iPad) was not working.  I checked their website, and there is no "Contact Us" link to use to provide feedback.. . This is a great place to go for some great food.  However, they need to improve their service.
Wait was too damn long. Had to wait about 2 hours to get a table and then about 45 mins to get the food. I ordered Hell's Burgr and it was very tasteless and bland, also I got the truffle fries and they Okay not too bad. Service sucked but I can understand due to the rush.
When I got to Vegas, this place definitely had to be one of the places I needed to check out when I decided to explore beyond the tasty buffets (although I couldn't resist going to one as soon as I landed and checked in). . Nothing beats a big, fat, juicy hamburger after a night of drinking and gambling. Especially one with duck bacon and over easy egg. YUMS! This my friends, is the farm burger. It is a MUST TRY! My boyfriend ordered the earth burger without realizing it was a vegetarian burger (essentially a mushroom burger). We added on a patty and when the check came out, they charged us an extra 7 dollars for the patty...14 dollar burger and 7 dollar for a hamburger patty...someone please tell me how that makes sense??  My farm burger was also 14 bucks as well. . . Besides the whole mishap the food is really good =). I will be back
Went for the first time on Thursday June 5th for lunch around  2pm. Might have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the customer service. There is a great variety of burgers for everyone to chose from however our waitress killed the whole experience. She introduced herself and left her iPad on the table to look at drinks then walked away.  The table right next to us had a waiter who took the time to explain the menu and recommendations as well as helped them pick drinks from the iPad. Our food took about 15-20 min to arrive. It was perfectly cooked and the fries were perfect for sharing. When it was time to pay the waitress gave us a checkbook with an iphone built into it. Who knows what it was for since she didn't explain it and the iphone was just on the generic home page. We were paying cash and the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes so we had to waive down a waiter to take our money. Everyone around us sounded so nice and helpful we just got bad luck I guess. On our way out we ran into the waitress again who was talking with the hostess, she didn't even bother to say thank you or goodbye.
Being a Gordon Ramsay fangirl, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of his restaurants while in Vegas. And the boyfriend, being a burger fanatic, couldn't pass up the opportunity to try another burger joint. It was the perfect match (and perfect excuse) to line ourselves up for 40 minutes to get one of those coveted tables.. . All of the servers are extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable about the burgers. Each one comes out in a perfect sphere of deliciousness, and it is quite a bit embarrassing to try to stuff it in your mouth to take a bite, so this may not be the place to take a first date. I ordered the Farm Burger, and everything was absolutely scrumptious. I savored every single bite and felt perfectly full afterwards. The truffle fries were equally as yummy and are definitely a must-try.. . The cherry on top that made this meal even better was the dessert shake. I ordered the coffee with chocolate hazelnut pudding (doesn't that just sound amazing?), and I was in heaven. If there's one thing that I would want to eat when I'm having a bad day, it's that. I'm craving it right now as I'm being reminded of its creamy and chocolatey taste. Mmmmmm..... . Just as expected, this Gordon Ramsay restaurant delivered absolute perfection, and the price isn't too bad considering the other non-buffet options that are available on the Strip.
I was in Vegas and I was planning on going to a different restaurant for dinner, but I LOVE Gordon Ramsay, so my friend and I decided to check it out. We only had to wait in a 15 minute line, and I loved that time. I got to check out Gordon's cookbook and grab a T-shirt while I was waiting. The vibe was GREAT and the food was EVEN BETTER! Best burger I have ever tasted in my life.. . If you are looking for a great place to eat, go to BURGR! The service was awesome, the food was quick, and it was SO inexpensive especially for one of Ramsay's restaurants.. . LOVED IT. I can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can have another burger :)
Took my family here when they came to visit and they all loved it! It is a little on the pricey side but I guess it comes with the name, we had about a 40 minute wait for our party of 8 which wasn't too bad and they send you a text so you don't have to wait there. The truffle fries were awesome as well as the gourmet burgers. My daughter had a hot dog and it was huge and amazing! Great service as well!
Had a great, albiet expensive, lunch here on our Vegas trip. We stayed at the Planet Hollywood and only ended up here because passing by it to get to the strip it smelled so amazing. We went for lunch and did not wait long (maybe 5 mins) to be seated. Dinner time this place seemed totally packed. For lunch, he restaurant was pretty full and the line filled up immediately after we got sat. Good timing.. . While everything is reasonably priced ($13-$15 a burger isn't terrible) we threw in an appetizer and some parm truffle fries, and a couple of beers, to total out a roughly $85 lunch.. . We started with a couple beers, our server was incredibly knowledgable and helped us out by giving us a couple samples when he had the chance. We also got the Jalapeno Poppers which were delicious. Although it's supposed to have 5 poppers and one spicy surprise (a 6th popper with the seeds still in tact) we had 3 with seeds still in tact, which we didn't hate. Very spicy but very good. The presentation was very cool and original, putting each popper in it's own shot glass of ranch, but we did find by the time we got to the last few, the crispy exterior of those remaining poppers became soggy with the ranch.. . The girlfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which she enjoyed (though couldn't eat it all). I had the Farm Burger, which had the OverEasy egg, Duck bacon, and sharp english cheddar. The cheese wasn't as sharp as i'd hoped and the duck bacon was a nice touch. I love a good egg on a burger and this did not disappoint.. . The burgers are delicious but definitely big enough to share if you want to do an app and fries. The fries are ala carte, but the truffle parm fries were definitely the highlight of the meal. At times the toppings were a bit heavy with parm but you can shake some of that off onto the rest, or suck it up and enjoy it. hahaha. The fires are big enough to share for 2 or 3 also.. . Our server, damnit that I would forget his name now, made our experience very smooth and nice. He picked out a great beer for the girlfriend (aged with rum and whiskey), and was prompt with any requests we had.. . The elusive 5th star is only for reasons of pickiness and the know that while it was a great and delicious experience, it is just that. An experience. Something we would possibly not do on our next visit to save the chance for another restaurant to blow us away, or maybe just to vie for a cheaper, quicker lunch. But if you are a big burger fan, like a little variety to the burger option, and are big Gordon Ramsey nerds like us, this was definitely a great lunch option if you have the coin to spare on the meal.
This place is overrated. I was so excited to try the Famous Gordon Ramsay Burgr. There was a small line to get in the restaurant that was moving very slowly. Lucky for me I am a platinum member. Which means I get to go in front of the line. Went with another couple and they were super excited as well. Our server was very patient and friendly. Burgers were a decent size but none of us finish our burger because we had all regret coming her. We  all agree In N out was much tastier. Fries were stale and over cooked. Bill ended up to be around $70 bucks. What a waste of money.
Maybe it was the whale of a meal I'd already had at bacchanal or the way the waiter oversold my burger to me, but burGR did not live up to the hype. . . Not to knock on our waiter, he was extremely professional and very enthusiastic. Service here was certainly a plus factor. But when I go to a place I'm generally more interested in food than service/ambiance. . . Let's start with the good:. - The beer! With lots of beers on tap I was super excited to pick one I'd never heard of before. Le fin de monde (or is it du mond? Cant remember french when I most need it..) was a great beer and I'll be looking for it on menus in the future. . - The parmesan truffle fries were a bit thick cut for me, but the truffle aioli dipping sauce was amazing. I've never ordered seconds on a sauce before (ok that's a lie, I love sauce) but the waiter offered and I couldn't say no. . - The boy's chili hotdog. At first i rebuffed him for ordering a hotdog at a burger joint but turns out he had the right of it. The dog was longer than the bun which i LOVE. Hate it when my dogs are hidden in a sea of endless carbs...but I digress. . And the negative:. There's really only one negative, but it's a big enough one to bring this review down to 3 stars, and that is the burger itself. . The waiter highly recommended the Hog burger and sold it to me with high praises. I went with it and was sorely disappointed. . The meat was not nearly as juicy as it could have been and there was no flavor to the burger. . After a few bites I had to resign myself to just eating the fries (and that sauce, mmmm). Eventually I scrapped the arugula off the top of the burger while leaving the meat untouched. The boy looked on incredulously, when I choose a veggie over meat there's something direly wrong. . . So, sorry BurGR, everything else was GReat but your burger was NOT, but I wish it had been. I truly do.
Sad to say, but my recent visit to BurGR was absolutely disappointing. It's less than a year since my previous visits to BurGR and I'm surprised how dramatically the quality has gone down. I've had great experiences the first couple of visits last year when the place just opened and raved about it to my friends & bf. My bf finally got to try it and I'm mad at how bad the experience was for us. We came Mother's day weekend and I have no idea what was up w/ the restaurant that friday night.. . We both got the hell's kitchen burger w/ a fried egg with added duck breast bacon and I had to get my burger recooked FOUR times. Even on the 4th try it still wasn't what I wanted and my Bf's burger wasn't what he wanted either. The customer service was crap that night too compared to my previous visits. I ordered my burger medium, and 2 times it came out medium rare, the third try it came out practically well done & dry and they forgot the duck breast bacon, 4th try it came out medium well.  I got tired of sending it back to the kitchen to get it redone so just settled, plus I was getting full from eating the fries while waiting.  My bf ordered his burger medium rare and his came out very rare. Normally he is fine w/ rare things since we eat steak tartare and all, but this burger patty looked gross. There was like blood from the patty oozing on his plate. Seriously, it looked like all they did was throw the patty on the grill then flip it really quick and served it. He didn't even finish the burger, only took one bite and left it there. He didn't wanna send it back to the kitchen to have it redone 'cause he felt bad since mine had to be redone so many times! ALSO our whole table agreed that the patties didn't taste seasoned at all. I've had this burger many times before and seriously it did NOT taste like how it used to be. HOW DO YOU FORGET TO SEASON THE PATTY?!. . In despite of all this, our waitress didn't even offer to comp the poorly made burgers. I was really sad that the burgers AND service aren't as good as my first couple of visits when they had first opened. Not sure if they had an off night, but I would think they'd be consistent w/ quality service and food. First impressions mean a lot and my bf was so disappointed he doesn't even think it's worth coming again to give them a second chance. The only good thing that night was the milkshake and fries.
My favorite burger place in the Las Vegas area so far. Have tried Bobby flays burger palace and Mario batalis B&B, Burger Bar and it doesn't compared to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr. Burgers are cooked to perfection with high quality ingredients. Onion rings and chicken wings are also amazing. Service was top notch. Will need to try Guy Fieri's restaurant next time Im in Vegas.
I was pretty stoked to come here (big fan of Mr. Ramsay).. . The wait wasn't too bad. The ambience is cool. And the decor was exciting. . . I ordered the Farm Burger; which was absolutely delicious, and two cocktails. . . The service was nice. Everyone was fast, friendly and efficient! So 5 stars :-)
I eat a lot of burgers but this was the best I've ever eaten. Ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. Mouthwatering & flavorful, cooked perfectly. I expected quality with Gordon Ramsay's name attached but I was blown away. The parmesan truffle fries were the perfect compliment. "Oh my God" came out of my mouth every bite. So good. We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table, not bad. Service, atmosphere & food was excellent.
Hit this place at night. Matter of fact, I was the last customer that they let in. I am a burger fan and I was with my wife and another couple. We all wanted to come and taste a good burger. Well, I was a bit disappointed. The yhave a great selection. I ordered mine with cheeses and bacon. simple medium cooked. I did take on the garlic fries. I will tell you that the burger was a good size, the bun was a great one, however I was not impressed with the flavor of the meat. Nothing to call home about at 12 dollars just for the burger. Now the fries were amazing, and what you for them matches the goodness. . . Everyone came out there saying ehhh, it was ok. They got nothing on Burgerfi or burgers & Beer joint.. . Sad to say, but I will have to pass on this one...
I considered giving this place two stars because our server Tammy was hilarious and the milkshake I ordered was amazing (shake + pudding=genius) but we didn't come for the service or the shakes.... . Obviously, we waited an hour and a half to get into Burgr to sample Gordon Ramsay's version of this American Classic.  We went with the Hog Burger, sold to us as "GR's most famous" burger. It was terrible. The meat had an odd, almost raw texture. There was little in the way of flavor apart from a strange one no one could identify.  I have to imagine even Chef Ramsay himself would've tossed this one in the trash.  . . I love burgers. And I love trying new restaurants. But this one was a huge disappointment and a colossal waste of cash.
This is a rather late review on my end. Went to Vegas with a groups of friends two weeks ago and we decided to try this place out. At first when I heard about it, I was worried about how my wallet would end up, considering that it's a five star restaurant and known for its burgers because of Gordon Ramsay. Surprisingly the bill wasn't too harsh, my burger, Hell's Kitchen, was only $14! However, we had to wait one hour to get a table and another 20 minutes to get our food. We were starving by the time out food arrived. We ate at night so I understand why it would be so crowded, but the wait was a bit of a downer on my parade. But the food was delicious! My burger, Hell's Kitchen, had roasted jalapenos, oven roasted tomatoes, asadero cheese, and the beef was cooked medium rare, just the way I like it. There were supposed to be sliced avocados, but I hate avocados so that was excluded from the burger. The wait for the burgers was longer than the time eating them. They are decently portioned, although I wouldn't mind them being a bit bigger. Some of my friends claimed to still be hungry after the meal, but I felt full. Appetizers like their Maui onion rings and truffle fries weren't bad either, love the chipotle ketchup! Only con of the dinner was the wait.
I went there may 31st. I mean the best part of the meal was our waitress n our appetizer.  The burger? Meh! Way over rated and priced. I make better ones at home.  11 dollars for fries? I mean they better knock my socks off. Well they are still on....the wings were amazing. I would have the appetizer for my main course. Sadly. I probably won't come back unless I'm forced to.
I have to say - I was very disappointed. Maybe chef Gordon should visit his own restaurant with the Kitchen Nightmares... He would probably trash the burger.. I went there with my family on Friday night. The place was busy, we were expecting little bit slower service but haven't expected to be waiting for the beverages at least for 10 min. Each of us ordered different burger. I decided to go with the flagship Hog Burger. It was the most bland piece of meal I had in a very long time. There was not a single ounce of flavor in it. It was like eating some kind of warm tasteless substance, my stomach was getting full, but my taste buds haven't register any kind of sensation. Similar with other burgers. They all tasted like the meat was heated in the microwave, the only difference were bits of various veggies or cheese. The buns were tasteless as well. For an average $17 a burger it feels like a huge rip-off. I love to cook. I use many wonderful recipes from Gordon's cook book on the daily basis, so my disappointment was even bigger. The worst culinary experience of my Vegas trip. S.
Good but too salty. Sad tosay but I rather have an In and Out or Tommy's burger.  It is a must try though.  The onion rings were very good.
I don't think Gordon has tried his onion rings. To heavy and thick with a very hard batter.  The hog burger is not something I would order again however the sweet potato fries were very good
4 of us went in there for lunch and were completely blown away! These burgers are the best we have ever ate. I had the Brittania Burger and I was in heaven. Others got the Farm Burger...incredible. We also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and you will not be disappointed!!! So delicious! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and go there again. Gordon Ramsey sure know how to hit your taste buds.
My wife and I have been wanting to visit this restaurant for years.  We've both been a Gordon Ramsey fan for some time.  . . This place was AMAZING.  Service was great, food was outstanding and we're definitely going to go back again when we get to Vegas the next time.
Here's whatcha do. You get yourself some sweet potato fries, a Shake #1 and a chanterelle burger (rare). Then you dip the fries into the LAYER OF PUDDING on the top of the shake and before that sweetness dissipates, you jam a fistful of buttery smooth ground cow right up in your face.. . Repeat until you've cleaned your plate, glass and cone of salty sweet shame.. . THEN you stand up, punch a security guard right in the sack and run for it. Because you're going to need the adrenaline-fueled sprint from PH to, oh, let's say Golden Nugget to work off the calories.
So the wait was a little linger than expected but I assume most restaurants by celebrity chefs are. Once finally in we ordered the jalapeno poppers for the promise of at least one of them being spicy. Rarely are jalapeno poppers spicy and this was no exception. The farm burger was good.. Well cooked and the egg made it even better. I enjoy eggs.  Also tried the Parmesan fries which were also good. All in all I would come back if the line was shorter!
Big fan of Gordon Ramsay. Not impressed at all with this place.. . We ordered all the most popular things:. 1. Onion Rings: Too salty.. 2. Truffle Fries: Decent. . 3. Farm burger: Decent, nothing special. Bun was good. Prefer crispy bacon. . 4. Chili Devil Dogs: Hot dog was way too salty. Bun was good.. . Other points of interest:. Service was good: The hostesses and waitress were really nice and accommodating.. No kids menu.. Wouldn't cut burger or hot dog in half for us because it would ruin the presentation(which is fair).. . Would have given it 1 star if the price was exorbitant but it wasn't outrageous.
We came here at some profane hour to grab a bite to eat after our drive from LA. The place was beautiful-- holy cow!! (heh heh). The decor was tasteful and unique; it definitely felt like a higher-end burger joint. Service was also great. Our server was attentive, helpful, and enthusiastic. . . My friend and I split a Euro Burger and we got the sweet potato fries to split between 4 of us. They brought out the burger already cut in half with an extra plate, which was super nice. The burger itself was pretty good, but a bit on the pricey end for what you get ($16). It wasn't the greatest burger I've ever had, but was still interesting and tasty. The Euro burger had truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato. The goat cheese was pretty prevalent, but the other ingredients were pretty forgettable. The sweet potato fries ($9) were amaze! I'm not really a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but these were so unique that you can't not like them. First of all, the presentation is pretty intriguing-- the healthy dose of crisp, piping hot fries are served in a metal cone alongside a shaker of vanilla powdered sugar and a side of honey jalapeno mayo. (Ew, the more I think about dipping fries in mayo, I get grossed out. At the time, these were delicious.) The truffle fries scent was pretty much wafting throughout the restaurant, so I'd definitely like to try these next time. . . It's worth checking out, but more for the non-burger parts of their menu. I personally liked Holsteins better!
I think it was a good burger, but as is the case for all restaurants in LV, way overpriced. Given all the new burger places popping up around the country, its just not worth it. Shake Shack is better, cheaper, and more fun. But when in Vegas, you have little choice. Service was quick and pleasant.
I wasn't about to leave Las Vegas without eating at at least ONE celebrity chef's restaurant, and BurGR was one of the less bank-breaking options.. . We went in for lunch and, unsurprisingly, the line was quite long. BurGR takes the casual-dining concept of queuing (a short-distance pager) to a much more modern conclusion: they'll text you when your table is ready. After about ten minutes of wandering around the Planet Hollywood Casino where BurGR is housed, our table was ready and we were led inside.. . The interior is classic American burger-bar: sleek metal, shiny white countertops, and the menus feature a flabbergasting Gordon Ramsey foldout. . . The menu offers a wide range of burgers (and other non-burger offerings, but they are totally besides the point), from the traditional American (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion) to the Farm Burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) to the Euro Burger (goat cheese, truffle aioli, arugula, and an oven-roasted tomato). I went with the Euro Burger and it was certainly one of the best burgers I've had. Wonderfully savory, with each part of the burger complimenting the rest, while one ingredient could easily have over-powered the others. The side of truffle fries (hand cut fries covered with truffle salt and truffle-parmesan shavings, with a truffle aioli dipping sauce) were delicious to the point of addictive.. . It's not a cheap meal, by any stretch, but you ARE on the Strip eating at a restaurant operated by Gordon Ramsay.
I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was way too spicy and the meat was not at all flavorful or contain any distinguishing spice or .... FLAVOR. I had to add a ton of salt to make it taste relatively edible. The fries looked nice, but they too, were bland. Shake # 4 is delicious- then the custard messes it all up. The service was polite and friendly, but the food was lacking. May I also add that the funky ketchups are way too ambitious at being funky. It just tastes weird. I see people standing in lines to come here and I feel sad for them. :(
No joke, huge fans of Ramsey but BurGR was a HUGE let down! Expensive for an average place. If you really want good Ramsey food, try going to the expensive steakhouse inside Paris LV.  Trust me, the burgers an nothing special!
Great place to visit.  Great Burger! We went on a Saturday our party of 6 wait time was about and hour and a half.  Once we got it we had good service, I had the Jalepeno Poppers to start and a Farm Burger and Truffle Fries.  The poppers were great they had some heat.  The burger was good, I wish I new it didn't come with lettuce, tomato, onion etc.  The duck Bacon on ot was great tho.  . . The truffle fries were like steak fries.  Not a fan of steak fries, but they were good. . . Only thing was my dad order a salad from a waiter that was not my our waiter.  The other waiter said he would put it in, but my dad never got it.  Good thing too cause he was full from the burger and fries.
The Britannia burger was one of the best things I have ever eaten and the truffle fries weren't far behind. The staff was very friendly and trendy as well. It was a very trendy experience overall and the atmosphere was very fun.
I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings and a wonderful Beer. The service was phenomenal although the wait for our food was a little lengthy. Let me tell you, fabulous dishes like this don't come at microwave speed so come prepared to wait, every bite thereafter is totally worth it. The chipotle Ketchup was pretty amazing... Everything tasted so fresh, the flavors just burst into your mouth. I'll be back EVERYTIME I'm in town!
"Bloody hell! You can't even cook a burger properly!".  After a visit to BurGR, I have lost so much respect for the hardball, no BS when it comes to food and service celebrity Chef Ramsey. BurGR at Planet Hollywood was actually quite a joke. I can't believe Chef would put his name on an establishment that has less than stellar service, BIG problems in the kitchen, rundown decor, and honestly marginal food.  . . The joint: No reservations, so be prepared to wait in line. It appeared long; however, moved quickly. The restaurant space is jam packed with tables (seriously...elbow room only), so tables steadily open up. BurGR is "well worn."  I can understand a little wear and tear here and there, but the placemats were tattered, cloth napkins were faded, plates had half of what used to be the BurGr logo on them, and the painted floors were worn down to the concrete in several areas...definitely in need of a face lift. . . Now onto THE important part - the FOOD:. Husband had the Farm Burger with Duck Breast Bacon, sharp English cheddar cheese, topped with a soft fried egg. . I ordered the Euro Burger with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes. . Side order of "Just Fries" served in a large metal cone with curry and chipotle ketchups. . . Where to start? Food was delivered..."stone cold." Hubby's burger had died in the window, glaringly obvious by the congealed cheddar cheese and hard cooked ice cold (like cold from the fridge) egg. Mine burger was room temp at best. And, despite the fact that we each ordered different cook temps on our burgers (medium and med-well, respectively) they both arrived well-done.  We informed the waitperson (very lovely gal) and she offered to re-order. We were already an hour and a half in and had plans so we declined.  . . The General Manager, Joana Holtey, came to our table - offered a re-order...again "no thanks." She was very apologetic. Thirty seconds later Joana returned with another egg on a plate...that was COLD. Haha Obviously, they are precooking eggs in the kitchen. Ridiculous! Two minutes later Joana delivered a perfectly cooked fresh egg...by then half the burger had been eaten.  Two comp beers to go and the offer to return and give another comp try were much appreciated, but sadly the damage had already been done and we had other plans for the rest of the week. . . I think it's important to note that BurGR might have been having a particularly bad night. Prior to us ordering, we had a conversation with the couple sitting next to us about the issues they had with the Farm Burger - same over-cooked, cold egg. They sent theirs back 3 times and eventually just left without eating. Two people sitting behind us, three people sitting to the left us, and one person at the table in front of us all sent plates back. Wowza! And, that's just what we noticed in our little area of the restaurant. Not good Gordie! Not good at all! I'm going to heed the same order you so often give during "Hell's Kitchen" and tell myself to "F*&^ OFF!"...only this person won't be coming back. So disappointed.. . Oh, I almost forgot - there was a person walking around the restaurant offering to take group photos for sale. Really?! Tacky!
This place met all my expectation. I ordered shake that was out of this world! Creme brulee with Oreo Shake is amazing. It is a must order on the menu. Don't forget to bring your rewards card you get a discount! . The farm burger is ohhhhh so good. The fries and onion rings is a must order I promise you will not regret it.. . The server was just perfect and friendly! . Love this place and will return soon!
Our party of four waited close to an hour for a table (but the roulette table was close by and time just seemed to fly by) and the food was definitely worth the wait!. . The Farm Burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) was simply amazing and the Oreo milkshake to die for. The waitress was so remarkably friendly and chatty. For a Gordon Ramsay establishment and for it's location on the Las Vegas strip, the prices are just unbeatable!
I heard about this place from Vegas friends. Its on the tourist strip inside the Planet Hollywood casino but worth checking out. Get there before noon or after 2 cause the line to get in seems never ending. We got lucky that we stumbled upon it around 11am while looking for a breakfast hangover cure :) Come hungry cause the portions are big. I ordered the farm burger topped w/ duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar & fried egg. Never had duck breast bacon before but it sure was crunchy and thick...great alternative to the typical pork. My burger was prepped just right..medium rare. You have to try the parmesan french fries. Lots of flavor and sliced thick but had crunch..fried perfection. The icing on the cake was my Chocolate Hazelnut Pudding Coffee Shake Topped w/ Praline Cookie..yeah it's a mouthful and this creamy concoction sent me to food coma! I couldn't walk after so I sat at the nearby casino lounge and dozed off. See my pics.
I came here on a Saturday evening during MDW and was glad that the line wasn't insanely ridiculous. I probably waited about 30 minutes which is pretty good considering I've read some reviews that people had to wait over an hour to eat here!. . Once my boyfriend and I were seated, I immediately admired all the little details this restaurant had put attention into. The menus were really creative and the restaurant itself is beautiful and actually has flames around the entrance! Our server was friendly and funny and I liked how I could order drinks off of the iPad, it was a nice touch. . . My only complaint is that it took a WHILE to get my food. I wasn't in a rush or anything, but I was definitely hungry once my food came. My boyfriend and I ordered the onion rings, farm burger, and Hell's kitchen burger. It took at least 30 minutes to get my food, but the place was packed and my food was fresh off the grill, so I can't really complain but after waiting to eat there and then waiting to eat my food, I was pretty hAngry. . . Luckily the food more than made up for the wait. The onion rings were SO good. They weren't oily at all and the dressings that came with it were so creative. I believe one was cheddar ranch and it was to die for. Who would've thought to put those together? My boyfriend ordered the farm burger and he said it was delicious! I tried a bite out of it and I thought it was great too! I ordered the hell's kitchen burger which I liked better out of the two. The meat was really good quality and it was an interesting blend of ingredients. I would say that I was just a little disappointed because it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but that might be a good thing cause I could enjoy a small kick of heat without my mouth being on fire.. . Our total came out to be about $45 including tax and tip and it was pretty worth it since the burgers are pretty big and I had half of my burger to eat for later and they even packed me up extra cheddar ranch sauce cause I loved it so much. Overall, I'd definitely come back here again and try something else on the menu!
Hate to do this, Gordon Ramsay is undoubtedly a culinary genius and restaurateur. Our experience at this restaurant, however, was less than extraordinary. The food itself varied from okay to great and our server gave good service along with the rest of the staff supporting her on refills and pre-bussing. It was management that kind of soured the meal at the end.. . Shortly after the check was dropped, our server returned to our table to retrieve it saying her manager had forgotten to add the gratuity. Unfortunately for her, we were already ready to pay with cash that included a 20% tip and although I'm sure she didn't mean it, some of the guests in our party were offended by this. She returned with the new check which included the 18% gratuity and we voiced our concerns to her about the unintentional implication that was being made by her tacking on the gratuity after she had already dropped the bill... She apologized profusely and left to give us some time to pay.. . Then we found another issue on our check... A portion of it should have already been paid for by one of our guests who had paid on his card for his own portion of the meal. He was already cashed out and his credit card slip was signed. However the total still included his items giving us an incorrect amount to pay. We brought this up to our server who explained that we just needed to subtract what he paid from the total shown because apparently their system cannot take the items off the bill or subtract any amount already paid for? Being in the industry, I'm not sure why their system would be lacking functions such as splitting off items to a new/separate check or showing a remaining balance after any initial payment. A manager was brought to the table to reiterate what she had just explained. However the problem with this is that we were NOT informed of this system glitch beforehand or even when she had given us the check until we raised it as an issue. Had we trusted the establishment and not looked closely at the bill, we would have overpayed by $30+. We agreed our server had no bad intent to deliberately keep us in the dark but as a customer, it's hard to feel empathetic after all these issues. ALSO WE CAME HERE TO EAT, NOT DO MATH.. . Finally after all this, we found a final flaw on our check. The gratuity and tax was taken from the total bill, not from the remaining balance after the payment from our one guest. This means the that the grat and tax was higher than what it was supposed to be but by this time we were so sick of everything that we decided to just drop it, pay and leave.. . TL;DR CHECK YOUR BILL THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU LEAVE MONEY TO PAY. ALSO BE READY TO DO THE MATH ON YOUR OWN CHECK SHOULD YOU SPLIT PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE COMPUTER FOR SOME REASON WILL NOT DO THE MATH FOR YOU.. . P.S. The highlight of this dining experience was the jalapeno poppers. They are delicious. If you do decide to dine here order them. The hot dog is very salty. Our burger came out rare and barely warm when we asked for medium rare.. . I might give this place another try but with much lower expectations.
My boyfriend and I got the curry wings, hell's kitchen burger and parmesan truffle fries and they were all  very good! The price was reasonable.. . Service was good and of course all the workers are good looking, then again it's Vegas...everyone is good looking:)
I don't get all of the 4 star reviews. The burgers were okay, I've had better in my hometown. Burgers are "fancy" and pricey because of the name attached to the restaurant. Only good thing is that it was close and walkable from our hotel (Elara which is connected to PH). The staff however was friendly and patient with our semi large table.
Dined with the family last week on vacation. As a fan of the show, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and parm truffle fries and thought it was very good aside from the price. We ordered 3 burgers, one order of fries and some drinks and spent $75 after tip and tax. Took two stars off for the cost alone. I do believe Christina from Hell's Kitchen wasexpediting in the kitchen while we were there.
Ate here on a Monday evening, and waited for 15 minutes to be seated even with a platinum Total Rewards card. No worries, they can text you when a table is ready for you, which is very convenient and nice! We were seated and immediately greeted by our wonderful server, Mia. She was so helpful and nice, and gave great suggestions! I ordered the Farm Burger, and our table also split the Parmesan Truffle Fries and Onion Rings, all recommendations from her. They were all AMAZING. All of the sauces that came with the sides were amazing. My boyfriend, who hates ketchup and ranch, was scraping the bottom of the sauce bowls for the cheddar ranch and chipotle ketchup. We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops for dessert. I had high hopes as sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorite desserts. The presentation was unique and great, and the salted peanuts ice cream made the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Altogether, for 4 people, two sides, and two desserts came to $96. Not bad for Vegas! I will definitely be returning.
Been wanting to try this for a long time and i think the anticipation might have ruined my experience haha I shared a Farm burger and a hot dog with my gf and both were really good. The burger didn't really stand out from other gourmet burgers, BUT i will say it was good just not the best i've ever had. the hot dog was a bit more unique, but when i read the description in the menu it sounded like it would be better then it actually tasted. Overall, the food was good, the ingredients were fresh, kindof pricey for my taste, but definitely a place you have to at least try once. I do believe my expectations were way too high, but you might have a different opinion.
Got the Soba Noodle Chicken Salad - It was great - A spicy sriracha chicken, edamame, carrots, cucumber, avocado, sesame seeds, and the cilantro-honey-peanut dressing wrapped everything up the buckwheat noodles nicely. The dish contained a lot of pasta compared to the amount of chicken - would of loved more sriracha chicken.. . The sweet potato fries were great - comes with more powered sugar and a warm jalapeno aioli dipping sauce. The best!
My bf and I just got to Planet Hollywood and we were starved from the travelling. We didn't want to venture too far so we settled for BurGR. Best random decision ever! We had the Humus, I had the Fish n Crisp, and he had the Farmer Burger (or somewhere along that line). Everything was soo good! I usually don't like the bun on burgers or sandwiches but It was so good that I stuffed my face! Well, maybe not literally, but it was a close call. My bf didnt even need ketchup on his burger, which was really a first for him. They also had a wide selection of draught but we got to try a few before we made our choice. Our waitress was Heather and she's a darling.
The food was excellent, but I am not willing to give 5 stars due to a couple of things that are easy to fix yet were not. First the Soda was flat as water and instead of bringing me another Soda one with let's just call it fizz, they made me wait over 15 minutes just to say would you rather have lemonade! I thought they were putting in another CO2 bottle. The food arrived hot and fresh! Very tasty and each burger looked like a little masterpiece! My last gripe is it took 20 minutes to get our check, this was after they cleared our table. At the end of the day food was great, service was sub-par Gordon should have been there lighting a fire under their Ass!
It's a step up from eating at the airport. The burger was forgettable, the iPad menu is a gimmick, though it works for Vegas anyone with any taste would avoid.
Best burger we have EVER had!!  Truffle fries are amazing and the Oreo Shake with creme brulee on top was the icing on the cake!
AMAZING. . . My dream has always been to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and this place did not disappoint. Everything from the decorations and the ambience to the food and service was top notch. We got the jalapeno poppers to share and they all came in their own individual dipping tray of sauce. We also got the parmesan fries with the truffle dipping sauce which was so bomb. The sauce was so good that we had to ask the waitress for more and she brought us out three more individual cups of it, no charge. I ended up splitting the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro burger with my friend, and would definitely recommend the HK burger. In fact, the whole restaurant followed the HK theme perfectly, which I was totally into since I love that show. . . I also liked how for their drinks and desserts they bring out an ipad and have you scroll through the choices. Very modern and made for a great new experience. . . Pricey, since it's a GR restaurant, but worth every penny.
First of all, as a designer I would like to say it's very well branded and the attention to the details is noticeable (by me at least haha) ! From the moment you sit at your table, you have a sneak peek at a juicy potential burger on the back of your neighbours menu and the logo on your own. Open it up and see Mr Ramsay excited to show you his (or I guess his head chef's) finely crafted menu. Even the cutlery resembled flames! Having knowledgeable and attentive staff as well all added to an overall excellent atmosphere.. . The one peeve I had though was the line to get in. There is a sign that tells you to speak to the hostess before lining up. There is a line to do that apparently. We speak with her and she says just line up in the original line... But by then, couple parties have gotten in front of where we would've been! A bit later while waiting in the line, another girl then proceeded to take the number of people in our party... What's up with that? Either take names at the beginning and give an eta, or make that bs sign gfto! . . Enough of that... It's onto the food. We had onion rings and truffle fries to start. Both were nice. Just nice. I loved the sauces they came with as well,though I thought the truffle was a little too strong in the truffle  sauce. I cannot remember what the name of the burgerI ate was..(it had mango chutney) , but it was quite good. The patty was made to perfection... However, I barely tasted any mango. It was only a couple bites at the center of the burger where I got those flavours.. . So based on my experience, I definitely might go back again to try the other choices! Assuming they do something with that useless signage instructions in the line.
I think that this is the best burger joint in Las Vegas because of the environment and flavor/taste/presentation of the food. I got try these items:. - Farm Burger. - Truffle Fries. - Jalapeno Poppers. . Everything was amazing and you must try these 3 items during your visit here. All my friends agreed that it was a good choice to come here. Their waiting process is very streamlined and they will text you when your table is near-ready. Conveniently there are lots of gambling tables 50 feet away while you wait.. . After winning big at the tables, spend your hard earned cash at BurGR for a great food experience.
Seriously where have all these 4/5 stars come from? Possibly one of the worst burgers I've had in a long time if not ever. Dry, overcooked, under seasoned, Gordon should be ashamed of this place. Fries were 11 dollars, yes that's right 11 dollars! Give it a miss!!
Right there at the top with best burgers I've ever had! Very reasonable prices for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, even if it's burgers.. . We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger - perfectly prepared medium rare, with oven roasted tomatoes, asadero cheese, and roasted jalapenos. All the flavors worked well and the texture of the bun was great! I had this complimented with a glass of Boddingtons (of course, being at a GR place). . The American Burger was a classic taste. Again, the texture of the bun was perfect, which made the burger so much better. We also had the Truffle Parmesan Fries with truffle aioli which made it a great side combination.. . We ended the meal by sharing the Shake #1 - caramel pudding + chocolate shake + toffee cookie. It was amazing and delicious! We were already pretty full from the burgers and fries though, that we couldn't finish the entire shake.. . What a fun place and great for families! There was a bit of a wait, but they texted us when our table was almost ready, giving us a chance to roam around the casino floor. They have a good selection of BurGR souvenirs, from shirts, to hats, and shot glasses. We decided to purchase of couple of their beer glasses, a great reminder of a great restaurant!
I went here after EDC. I would come back again.. . The wait was not as bad, but still we had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. In my opinion, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant was amazing.. . This place had superior customer service. Friendly and knowledgable staff attended to all my needs. . . I had the hog burger - it was not that good. Even though the waiter reccomended it as the #1 burger, I did not like it. However, it had an unique taste ~ one that i've never had before. It tastes close to sweet tangy spinach dipped in orange.. . Then we had the chili dog. DELICIOUS. At 13 dollars, this was one of the best dogs I've bad. . . We finished with truffle fries, and they were great as well.. . For the atmosphere and food, 4 stars. Never getting that burger again though.
Ate here for my first night in Vegas before EDC. The food was okay, not nearly what the reviews had me expecting. . . More importantly, I got food poisoning.  Not an awesome way to start my weekend. Stay away from this mediocre poison factory.
the hella kitchen and Chanterelle burgers were the best ever. the service was really nice. they have la fin du monde, which you should try.. . always get the truffle fries and onion rings. . Gordon Ramsay's burgr makes me wet. . they also take your picture, so pose like Ramsay :)
I went here for lunch before EDC with my girlfriend on a beautiful hot sunny day. The line didn't look long but it took 30mins to get a table. Which I didn't mind considering this restaurant was featured many times on food network, its Gordon Ramsay restaurant AND it's on the STRIP, come on. It's Vegas, one of the BIGGEST tourist spot in the country, if you want good food, you're going to have to wait. Our server Matt was fast, responsive, friendly and very descriptive towards educating us about the menu. This was our first time so Matt did us the biggest favor by going over the menu without me having to ask, which I highly appreciate. Matt if you're reading this, we want you to know that we think you're a great asset to this restaurant and we can't thank you enough for the excellent customer service, we will be coming back in hopes we have you as our server again! The food was absolutely AMAZING. I wouldn't change a thing. My girlfriend and I got the Farm Burger, the sliders and the sweet potato fries. First bite on all three blew me away, no really, man was it good. Don't listen to all these other haters on yelp saying negative feedback about this restaurant, you're definitely getting your money's worth here. If you think about it, BJ's has the similar price range and it's no where as good as this AND it's in VEGAS (because we all know prices go up just because it's on the strip). I'm actually considering staying at a hotel close by the next time I'm in LV just because of this place. Look no further, this is a place you don't want to miss out on! I'm definitely coming back!
The first time wasn't that bad. We waited, got in after getting the text message, and had some decent burgers and great shakes. . . The second time was a little embarrassing to bring a friend from out of town to. . . The burgers were still decent, but nothing remarkable. What was really disappointing was the garlic Parmesan fries that were way too salty and could barely be eaten. We wanted to tell Gordon Ramsey that his establishment has ruined garlic Parmesan fries for us forever. . . I would give this restaurant one more try before throwing in the towel. Or napkin, as it were.
I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place! I seriously think you could close youe eyes and point at anything on the menu and it would be mouthwatering perfection! The sweet potato fries and the jalapeno poppers were AMAZING! We are definitely sad we dont have this restaurant in our city!!
This was the best burger I have ever had. I had the Hell's burger and the truffle fries... It was worth every penny. The restaurant was clean and the ambiance was a mix of edgy class. Good service. I cannot wait to eat here again
Line was huge. Luckily i came alone and walked immediately up to the bar. Service was good as I was greeting right as I sat down.. . The beer selection is surprisingy decent.. . Place is really packed. Even on a Tuesday evening.. . Ordered the farm house burger. It's a duck burger with an egg on top of it. The burger is juicy and the bacon adds a great semblance of crunch.
Uber cheeseburger was amazing!  Service was ok, and the prices weren't bad.  Looking forward to going back to try the shakes!
Came in on a Wednesday night around 6:00 and the wait for two wasn't bad, about 15 minutes. . . Started with the jalapeno poppers which were deliciously spicy. The presentation of them in their own dipping "shot glass" was fun, but made them lukewarm and soggy on one end.. Burgers were cooked perfectly juicy and delicious:. Farm Burger- anything with an egg on it is an A+, but when you add duck breast bacon, makes it so much better. Hell's Kitchen Burger- flavors of the cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted jalapenos, and avocado worked really well together. Truffle Parmesan Fries- the fries were good, the aioli dipping sauce on the side made them excellent
Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my girlfriend had the American burger. Both were great. Fresh. Not served hot though. Served warm. Fries were stale, and I watched them sit under the light for a while. Service was mediocre. Not Gordon Ramsey quality. Waited in line for 45 minutes too long. Then waited 30 minutes to be served after we ordered and it wasn't even that busy. For the wait, I would not recommend it. You can get good burgers elsewhere without the wait.
I am a Vegas local, and I had some friends visiting from out of town, this was their last nite in town. So we decided to do dinner here as it was centrally located and we thought it would be a fun place to try. They had gotten there before me, and had just been seated as I arrived.  We were seated around 6p.  There was a total of 5 of us in the group.. . It took the waitress about ten minutes to even approach our table, and when our waitress came she was overall nice, but spoke very softly and it was beyond hard to hear a word she said. We started by ordering water and a martini for one of my friends at the table, the drinks took about 15-20 minutes to arrive.  When the waitress returned to take out order, we ordered the jalapeno poppers (which I thought were intended to be an appetizer), a blue burger, uber cheese burger, chicken burger, a standard dawg, and the sweet potato fries.. . We waited at least 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and during this time the waitress never came back to check on us, but we saw our server pass by the table consistently and quite often and literally bus the table sitting right next to us, but never once stopping to check in and let us know the status of our order, or simply to just check in and see how we were.. . When our food finally arrived, the "appetizer" we had ordered arrived with the burgers.... so much for an appetizer!. . I liked the idea of the jalapeno poppers being served in the shot glasses with their own dipping sauces, but overall it seemed to ruin the taste and texture of the poppers, they became lukewarm and very soggy! I did not enjoy the honey jalapeno mayo dipping sauce at all, the flavor was just very off and not appetizing. The burgers were juicy and delicious. The sweet potato fries were also good..  . Overall the food was good, but I think that the service we had just really ruined the overall experience for me!  We only found out our servers name once we received the check... so I would say if you go- avoid sitting in "Dorota's" section if possible.
nothing impressive besides the name.
Food was delicious. I had the Britannia burger and sweet potato fries. The waitress was very helpful, making recommendations without being too pushy.
I came in for lunch and was seating immediately at the full service bar. The staff was friendly and quick to help.. . The most exceptional aspect to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR's food wasn't the flavor but it's incredible lack of any flavor. The burger I had was cooked medium rare, just like I asked. Can't blame the cooks for that. Topped with arugula, a roasted tomato and a truffle aioli.. . The burger patty had absolutely no flavor. I'm not sure it had any spices added to the meat. It tasted like a patty you'd find at a cheap roadside diner. Gray and greasy.. . The tomato was so soft and bland I questioned why it was even there. The arugula I can't say anything either way about, after all it's just arugula. However, I did love the truffle aioli. It was the only thing that was positive about the burger.. . I also ordered the "just fries." And that's exactly what they were. Just fries. They were served with a chipotle ketchup and a curry ketchup. The chipotle ketchup was alright. Seemed like a weird thing to try and make the place nicer with ketchup when the food itself was so bland. The curry ketchup just was so out of place. I'm not opposed to having Indian influences in an American restaurant like this, but being the only Indian influence it was just out of place. . . If you go here, know you're paying for the name and not the food. I won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR anytime soon.
I came here with a business partner today for lunch. Im assuming since it was a Wednesday in the middle of the day was the reason it was a little slower. I've heard this place is constantly packed. There was no line and we were able to be seated right away.. Our servers name was Devin, super cute blonde who is identical to Britney Spears (probably why I can remember her name) She was really sweet. She showed us the iPad menu they have of all the beers they have on draft. Awesome selection, I chose the Chainbreaker.. . We started with the Hummus, I wasn't a fan of the veggie sticks but the pita bread is pretty good. I got the Hells Kitchen Burger and my co worker got the Britanna. Both great burgers. We also got a salad that the Manager ended up dropping off to us. Very friendly and made sure we were doing okay. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back!
MMMMmmm. Yummy burgers but VERY expensive! This is a high end burger place on the strip. Burgers are on average of $15 and fries/onions rings are a staggering $10! If the sides weren't so expensive, I would come back... but since the prices are so high, this is more of a "try it once" type of place. . . I ordered the Farm Burger that came with duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg for $15 and the truffle parmesan fries for $10. Those are the Total Rewards prices. Without the card, it's $1 more for each item. My friend ordered the hog burger for $17 beer battered maui onion rings for $8. Our total was about $53 for just the 2 of us... and we didn't even order drinks! That's pretty damn expensive for burgers. . . I must say though, that the food tasted amazing! Everything was really tasty and well presented. It was our first ever experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Service was also quick and good. Food came out in a fairly timely manner. The food did taste just as good as it looked... but I've also been to other pretty fantastic burger places for about half the price! My egg on my farm buger oozed with yoke yumminess when I cut into the burger! It wasn't overly cheesy and all the ingredients went well together. The duck breast bacon was tasty and tender. My truffle fries came with 2 sauces, a garlic aloli and the other I can't remember. The fries were tasty but not good as leftovers. Onion rings were crispy and also very tasty, but also not good as leftovers. The food here is meant to be eaten fresh.. . This burger place is located inside Planet Hollywood. It's at one of the entrances right off the strip. There is a fire display at the entrance - really cool looking! When we went, the line pretty long, but moved pretty quickly. Now that if you are a party of 2, you must wait in line. If you have a party of 3+, you can give the hostess your name and number and they will text you when your table is ready. . . I'm glad I tried this place because it was really good, but chances are I won't be coming back because it's just too expensive! I was told by the guys at the table next to me that you can substitute the regular beef patty for a pork patty instead. I do not know how much that costs - but the pork is really tender and tasty - basically the kobe beef of pork. . . So, try this place because it's really good and to claim that you've eaten at one of Gordon Ramsay's establishments... but not really worth the price - so it's more of a try it once type of place. I don't think I can stomach paying $25 bucks for a burger and fries again. Just remember to use a Total Rewards card to save and extra buck off each item and if you have a party of 2 or less, you have to wait in line!
Excellent place to go for a burger, a bit expense but hey its Vegas so fits in with everywhere else.  The service was top notch, sometimes it is the little things like the waiter noticing we had spilled sauce on a coaster so he replaced it.  Remembering a previous conversation where we were asking about the truffle fries (excellent).  My wife and I also ordered the onion rings, the euro burger and the hell's kitchen burger.  All great.  The only thing I would not get again would be the pudding milkshake.  It tasted good but seemed like cold pudding instead of milkshake, so if you like pudding then this would be for you.
First Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been too :D. . Can't miss this place with all the flames and the huge line of people waiting to try burGR! I got pretty lucky coming here on a Saturday morning at 11 am. There wasn't a line so your best chance is to go early. My boyfriend and I were seated at the counter right in front of the kitchen so we were able to watch all the food being prepared. I thought it was fascinating watching all the burgers come out fresh from the kitchen making their way to the tables, I'm a visual person so looking at all the different burgers helped me determine which one I wanted.. . I got the Farm Burger because it has duck bacon and the fried egg made it an easy choice for me. I did enjoy the burger. One thing I noticed, you could taste the cheese, it didn't fade into the background. I really liked that because I love cheese! I thought the duck bacon was rich in flavor but as good as it was, I think the burger would've been better with a regular bacon because it would still provide that savory saltiness but with an added crunch that I thought the burger was missing. The egg was perfectly fried, one bite and the yolk was running. There was a lot of rich components to this burger, the duck bacon, the egg, and the sharp cheddar..it left me wanting something acidic or citrusy to balance all the richness. I also got fries and that was pretty good. Their fries are athicker cut so it was pretty dense in potato and it was larger in size. I really liked the chipotle and curry ketchup that came as dipping sauce! I also got the Shake #5 and that was SO GOOD. It was a coffee shake with hazelnut pudding and everything about that shake was decadent. Be careful not too drink all the shake because then you're left just pudding and you can't really drink that, and ask for a spoon so you can eat the pudding! . . I thought their service was wonderful, our server was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food here was superb. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I wouldn't mind coming back again.
I have to say I was not as impressed as other people on Yelp giving it 4 and 5 star reviews. I will say that it was good but by far not the best burger I've ever had. Also, to pay $60 for a burger, fish sandwich, fries and 2 sodas I felt I should have left amazed. Definitely didn't meet my expectations and my beautiful girlfriend agrees with me. I will say 3 stars....It was ok / good but not amazing.
Lackluster in flavor for what you'd expect of its eponym, Gordon Ramsey; however, defintely a tourist draw. Service and presentation were excellent, but for hamburgers and a couple of sides, you better be ready to shell out close to $40 bucks a person, sans drinks.
Was with a big group so was kind of loud not really a good place to be with if you want to chat and catch up. Other than that place was pretty neat. Good was fill of flavor and loved the curry ketchup with the fries. . . I had the hella kitchen burger. Medium well and loved the taste of the meat. :) I'll be back again.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the servers. I really couldn't understand them since it was loud and they topped off  my Sierra mist with water and didn't ask if it was soda or water.
AMAZING burgers, shakes and fries ! The hype is REAL.. . Burgers were cooked to perfection and the truffle fries had so much flavor w/ the perfect amount of garlic bits and parmesan cheese!. . I will make a stop here each time I am in vegas.
Best Burgers in Vegas.  The meat is great, juicy and cooked perfectly.  The buns are the best I've ever had.  I've had the Britannia Burger both times I've been and it is outstanding.  The burger is worth the price tag, but the fries are not.  They are good for sharing, but not if you're by yourself.  And I'm not a fan of their house-spiced ketchups.  The wait isn't too terrible.  And the service is friendly and efficient.  And the waitress outfits are quite nice.
This was NOT what I envisioned. . The restaurant is filled with beautiful people and the food coming out looks spectacular but 18.00 for a hamburger (added egg) that tastes ok is just too rich for my blood.   I would happily pay 23.00 for a burger that is spectacular.  I also was looking forward to the pork belly burger which I had seen on yelp but was not on the menu.  That is  my fault for not inquiring about it when the waiter asked if we had any questions.  In the end, it was good just not for the price.  The uber burger was crazy salty , not from the cheese..like literally I tasted salt granules.
I'm always at PH when I'm in Vegas and there's always a wait for BurGR, so this time, we decided to try it.. . I ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The Farm Burger was good. Not great, and definitely did not live up to the hype. It was made well and the duck breast is unique, but it was literally just duck, egg, cheddar, and bun. It was too plain in my opinion.. . The truffle fries was yummy, but a little too thick in my opinion. I like my fries skinnier! Also, the ketchup and aioli are homemade and have unique tastes. My friends wanted to ask for normal Heinz ketchup but thought that would be embarrassing.. . Overall, I was pretty disappointed.
Chef Ramsey.. Practice what you preach.. Food excellent. Place excellent.. Server equals to none.. Order took over 40 minutes when we asked about our order.. Server said :. " I know isn't that crazy they are very slow". Haha couldn't believe it, I'm a master chef fan I you show discipline and amazing customer service, not at burgr Las Vegas.
what to order: farm burger, chicken wings, truffle fries. tip: waiting isn't so bad with the texting system, go drink & gamble!. . went with 4 of my friends on a Saturday afternoon after dayclub. I like the way their seating is set up, you tell the hostess how many, they quote you a time & they send you a text when the table is ready. we were sat within 30min! . . we ordered: jalapeno poppers, chicken wings, truffle fries and the farm burger. . . the chicken wings were surprisingly really good!! I liked them better than the jalapeno poppers, which were a little too mushy and I didn't like the sauce. I really liked the truffle fries too!. . the farm burger was really good but I wished they had a side or the option of lettuce, onion and tomatoes.. I was too full to ask. the burger was too heavy on the protein side, it was lacking that fresh taste you get from the vegetables and ketchup.. . I would definitely come back and try other burgers, the burger party meat was so juicy!
Had the American Burger and it was FABULOUS!!!  the price was not too high and the burger was one of the best I've ever had.  Service was friendly and the food comes out quick despite how busy they are. Very popular place. I definitely will return.
Wir waren 2 mal bei GR's BURGR und hatten unter anderem den Uebercheesburger ( 15$ ), HellsKitchen Burger ( 14$ ) und die Truffle Parmesan Fries ( 11$ ) -  viel besser gehen Burger nicht ! So einfach ist das !. . Der Service ist Standard, das Menu sehr ubersichtlichund preislich etwas gehoben - sicherlich zahlt man hier auch den Namen mit - nichtsdestotrotz sind auch die Zutaten der Gerichte sehr hochwertig - geschmacklich war das ganze fur mich eine kleine Offenbarung ;)
Being a Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to try this place on a recent trip to Vegas.  I was worried it would be over-hyped, but I was pleasantly surprised. It took about 15 minutes to be seated for 2 people on a busy weekend night. Not bad at all. We started with the onion rings, and my god, they were incredible. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the flavors were awesome. We had the Hell's Kitchen and Chanterelle burgers. Definitely some of the best burgers I've ever had. Prices aren't terrible considering it's on the strip. Food arrived in a timely manner and our waitress was nice. Not horrible service, but not amazing either. I would definitely return here!
The best burger I have had, definitely plan on returning to try another. This place was very nice and the overall service was great. The wait for food was a bit long but that could be because we were starving at the time. I would definitely recommend making a reservation, after we left there was a long line of people waiting.
Loved it!!! It was a very relaxed and pleasant experience. None of the uppity feeling like from other restaurants. Food was GREAT. Onion rings and trufflefries were soooooo tasty. Burgers were great and the sticky toffee pudding pops were a great way to end the meal. We will go back any time we can.
Went with 8 people during afternoon on wednesday and there was a line as usual, but the wait wasn't long.  Our waitress was slow and not as tentative as I would expect from a "Gordan Ramsay" restaurant.  The food took a long time to come out but it did come out all at once for all of us.  And paying for our bill took over 15 minutes.  Orders were some Hell's Kitchen burger and Farm burgers.  And we all agreed that these burgers were nothing special.  The patty itself was very plain.  For such a pricey burger, you would expect flavorful meal, but it was not.  Definitely not a place to return too.  I would give it a 2.5.
I was hesitant about going here as the prices for burgers were a bit high...but let me tell you, it is SO worth it! . . We started with the roasted jalepeno poppers; they were to die for! I could eat those all day. I tried the Caribbean dream cocktail, that was delish as well. For burgers, my hubby got the Hog burger with duck bacon--awesome! And I tried the Euro burger, also very good. . . We got a side of truffle fries and we are so glad we shared because the portion was huge. We couldn't get over how great the homemade ketchup was...can never have Heinz again :) Then we finished off the meal with a scrumptious Coconut pudding Strawberry shake. Would love to go back if we are in Vegas again.
Located in planet Hollywood, this burger joint is my favorite! I've tried almost all of them and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices. . Their truffle fries are to die for. And their chicken wing appetizer is also a good pick! . Everything on the menu is reasonably priced
Came here hoping to see my husband who won't return my calls. Gordon I love you!! Please call me!! Haha ok but really, this place is great. We ate here on a Saturday afternoon so there was a 40min wait which was fine because oh yea you're in a casino, so off we went to gamble while we awaited our text message notifying us they were ready for us. . We finally got the message and off we went. We ordered jalapeno poppers and onion rings, they did NOT disappoint! The poppers were just the right amount of spicy and the onion rings were good too. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was amazing! The only hiccup I had was the sliced pepper they put on the burger. it was too spicy for me but if you like spicy and love that extra kick then you'll love it, I just removed it. I'm already awaiting the next time I visit Las Vegas!! So exciting to find out he has two other restaurants in LV I can go stalk him at.
Awesome.  . Came with a group of 15.  We tried the jalapeno poppers, onion rings and wings for appetizers.  They were all great, and came with outstanding dipping sauces.. . I had the Euro burger - rare.  It was cooked perfectly, and the quality of the meat was outstanding.  Also tried the truffle fries - wonderful.. . The wait was pretty long, but when it's a Sat night in Vegas at a really great place to eat, that's to be expected.. . The staff was very friendly, and the service was really good.  It's not fine dining, but it is as delicious as you're going to get.  As my cousin (a CIA grad) who was with me said, there's nothing better to eat than a great burger.  This was a great burger!
