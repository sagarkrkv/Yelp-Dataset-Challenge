Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. . . The Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). . . The salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!
The. Oysters.  Still dreaming of the oysters!!  Briny, still in their juices, not too big, not too small, not fishy at all.  Came for happy hour and tried these little beauties.  Some of the best, if not best, I've ever had.  You think it wouldn't be hard to get oysters right, but it is.  1/2 off wine and beer for happy hour - and they have a good selection of both.
I'm not sure how you can call your place an English pub when you don't serve English beers. Bud light isn't an English beer. On top of it all the food was just ok. My advice pick another place to eat.
There's a lot of great food in Las Vegas, but somehow we keep coming back to this place.  It's real dependable.  The food tastes good.  Really good.  You can't go away hungry.  The outdoor seating is a real plus.  When you are more-or-less on the Strip, it's hard to dine outside in a sane but interesting place.  Watching the traffic between Aria and Crystals is far superior than sitting (or trying to sit) on the Strip itself.  Finally, although nothing is cheap eating-wise in Las Vegas, if you don't over-order here (hard not to do sometimes, because there is a good, interesting menu), it's actually perfectly affordable.
Sorry but the two stars is for the duck buns. A friend of mine recommended this place and I was really hoping I'd be bringing the rating UP, rather than down. Very disappointed. These duck buns have way too much hoisin sauce and are too salty with barely any duck for $17. The Belgian ale they recommend with it is a plus though. Dark and sweet. If you're coming here, the better bet might be the sliders. After all, it is a bar. . . One plus: their patio is pretty nice if you're looking for a calmer atmosphere. Great for people watching.
Good traditional atmosphere and great servers.  Great beer selection.  Food was okay and over priced.
Terrible. Hubby6 and I ordered Bloody Marys. We didn't realize they were $16 a piece! They were okay but not $16 good. We ordered pickles which were nothing more than Clausen jarred pickles and some Ralphs gerkins for $8. Bar stools were dirty. We wanted to like this place, but way too expensive for the quality. Nothing special. The only plus was free peanuts at the bar.  Wait staff were nice but not up to Vegas standatds. Save your money and go somewhere else.
We just love this place.  We first found the PUB two years ago and really enjoyed the food, the people, the atmosphere, etc...    we were last in Vegas this past January and stopped in with a group of 6 of us.  Everyone really enjoyed it as usual.  So when we returned on June 14 -17 we knew we had to plan on which day we would return.  So we decided Sunday so we could enjoy the bloody Mary bar.  My husband went for the ultimate and I just selected my own toppings from the menu.  We might downsize our Bloody Mary toppings next time so we can enjoy more food from the actual menu!!. My husband had the Cioppino, which he as been craving since he last had it in January.   It was everything he remembered.  I had the lobster Cobb salad.  It had a lot of lobster.  I really liked it.   . So for our last day we were trying to decide what to do for lunch.  Should we try Bobby Flay's burger palace? ?    Nahhh, we can get burgers at home.  We came back to the P.U.B.   . They didn't have Miller Lite which I normally drink so I saw a cider ale on the menu.  I asked about that and then the server recommended a Pineapple Cider ale.  It was soooo good.  now I'll have to see if I can find it anywhere.  . We split 3 appetizers for our lunch.   The shrimp cocktail whichh as a nice cocktail sauce, The crispy pickles with 3 dipping sauces and the Mussels.    All three were very good and plenty for us to share as a lunch.   My husband wasn't sure about the mussels.  He's been converted.  He loved them.. We love the P.U.B. and will look forward to return on our next trip to Vegas!!
Great place with a large craft beer selection and very good food. Really good place to watch the games and have fun with your opponents - great atmosphere.
1. Overpriced food. . . 2. Not so friendly staff , called in and reserved a table, came in and they said they don't reserve tables. My friend who called in said the person on the phone had a strong accent and it was easy to tell who it was so she complained. So they  had to give us a table anyways. then the waitress told me I had to down the rest of my Fat Tuesday before I was allowed to sit down. Rude.. . 3. Tables in the back are super close together, have to squeeze between chairs to get in and out.. . 4. Beware that it is a PUB meaning it will get LOUD. Everyone freely yells and screams as they're watching the games on the TV.. . But i do have to admit that some of the menu items was delicious and some were ok. I would recommend the rotisserie steak sandwich. It was cooked perfectly and they gave a large amount of fries with it. I don't think it was worth $20 though.
We have passed by this place multiple times on our trips to Vegas and stopped by on a whim for happy hour.  Glad we did!  1/2 price wines and pints, $2 oysters and $3 sliders.  LOVE the pretzel appetizer - great portion and favor for $8.  Can't wait to regain appetite for dinner!  Courtney is an amazing bartender - REALLY appreciated her recommendations and awesome, attentive service!!!!. . 1/10/15 We had the best waiter, Steve.  He kept us happy during the entire Seahawks game and had a great sense of humor.  Would definitely request him to take care of us again!
Great gastropub ambiance! Came in for the Happy Hour- 50% off beer and snacks! So this of course peaked our interest.... definitely a great choice! Really enjoyed the atmosphere, beer, and snacks!
Ordered the lobster roll from here. It was served on a buttery roll. Order came with 3 small sliders, chips, and coleslaw. The lobster was succulent and flavorful. The coleslaw wasn't as good. Will definitely be coming back for this popular menu item.
We came here for drinks and appetizers.  We chose the oysters because our waitress suggested them.  I loved the vibe in this place.  It was fun without being serious or thinking too much of itself since it was on the strip.. . The food, the service and the ambiance was great.  i would definitely come back here when i'm in vegas.
