Hotel was beautiful and the common areas are amazing. We had a handicap room so the shower just had a curtain and fold up seat. The water got all over the bathroom floor because there's no divider. Our room was above the pool so didn't have the great view of the Bellagio fountains. It's a huge place and there's a lot of wasted space it feels like walking through banquet hall areas to get to the other side of the hotel. The pools are nice just get there before 9:00am if you want two chairs together. Decent restaurants, one place for coffee and breakfast items. It would be nice if they had more fast food type places instead of all sit down. Oh, the elevators require a room key and it is so tricky to get them to work. You put your key card in the elevator and it doesn't let you select a room so you end up going up past your floor until you can get it just right. We missed our floor several times because of this.
Hands down, my favorite hotel in all of Las Vegas. Great location, easy access to both the Strip and cabs, and best of all, an art-driven "cosmopolitan" decor that goes beyond ultra-chic to a new generation of hip and fancy that will certainly be a mainstay. . . I've been coming here since 2009 and it has been the only hotel I stay at. They seem to always be adding new cool things to the hotel and rooms, the most recent of which seems to be choreographed cirque-de-soleil style dancers on swings and platform displays near the front bar and gambling area. Art is everywhere. Good music is everywhere. And the incredibly beautiful Chandelier Room bar anchors everything in a timeless way. Add one of Vegas's most popular nightclubs and dayclubs/pools (Marquee) and you've got the perfect hotel in Vegas.
I am only giving two stars because of their front desk agent, Myra. After the past few days of traveling and sleeping in our moving truck the night before, we were looking forward to arriving at a hotel so we could get some real rest. Traveling took a little longer than planned and we originally had a reso for June 1st using my boyfriend's Marriot points. We called on Sunday asking if it would be possible to switch our reservation to Monday, June 2nd. They were able to accommodate us and gave us our confirmation number.When we arrived Myra looked us up and said we were in for yesterday and were put as a no show so our points were used. She tried several confirmation numbers but found nothing. She went to talk to her managers Alfonso and Nate I believe their names were and came back telling us since they were fully booked they're not even suppose to be booking right now but they can give us a complimentary upgrade for $250 which is a great deal since their rates are sky high right now. So, you're telling me.. You used our points and you're fully booked and cannot book anymore rooms but you can give us a complimentary upgrade for $250. Oh my god what a deal!! So this means there is a room available. At this point my boyfriend was pretty upset and said that we definitely have a reservation for today and we have a confirmation number. No manager has come to assist at this point and Myra is pretty fed up with dealing with us. We called Marriot and they told us we definitely still have an active reservation and even gave us a Marriot confirmation number. This whole time Myra was saying, those numbers are too long that wouldn't be our confirmation number but we'll try it anyway- not in the best tone of voice. Instead of thinking, hey maybe someone should call their reservations manager or Marriot she decided to conveniently go on lunch when my boyfriend had a Marriot employee about to speak with her. She handed us off to Kevin who took it upon himself to call guest services was told that our reservation for today was canceled. He then decided to call Marriot and spoke with someone himself who told him that we in fact had a reservation today and it's still active. There was a mix up with guest services and the new reservation was never put in. We get that mistakes happen but this was over an hour of us trying to check in when it should've taken a few minutes. Kevin was seriously amazing. We appreciated his effort to resolve the issue. Cosmo needs more employees like Kevin. He got us an upgrade, $50 room credit, and a late check out which was nice since it took us over an hour just to check in. As a front desk agent, you're the first face guests see and you're usually the first person someone goes to with issues. Kevin was great and should definitely look into a managerial position because all their manager did was come over to the computer to ok the upgrade. Not even an apology for the inconvenience. I get the Cosmo is a massive hotel and managers are super busy, but instead of asking how are you (when you know we are NOT good), an apology for the mix up and inconvenience would've been nice. Thanks again Kevin! You made our stay at The Cosmo awesome!
Loved the rooms.  Clean, spacious and almost everything you could want was already in the room including a mini bar and snacks.
Well now I can say that I've stayed at the Cosmo. Service here is in impeccable, just like anywhere in Vegas. But I must say the room view was epic. Room was of relative size but I would say that I enjoyed my stay here. Something to note, they are on the more expensive side for rooms and was just sold to black stone group.
Came here for a business meeting and never had stayed here before!! . . This place is elegant, luxurious, and HHUGGGEEE!!. . Everything is very modern and when we checked in they gave us a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite with a balcony (just ask, it doesn't hurt if they say no)!! So awesome!!. .  Highly recommended!! Stay here when you come to Vegas!
I love Cosmopolitan. we got free comps so we stayed here Tuesday till Thursday. the rooms are so spacious and i love how all the rooms have outdoor balconies. we had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show front. our room included a japanese soaking tub which was super relaxing, definitely a great room if you're with your lover/husband/significant other. Theres convenient parking in the garage that is close to the hotel elevators near the East wing of the parking structure. The only negative I would say about the room is that there is no refrigerator, or at least not in the suite we were staying at, only a minibar. I would stay here all the time, but only if we got comps. Otherwise, at $300/night its way out of my budget. :T
Came here for a business trip. Great choice very nice and elegant. A bit on the pricey side but worth it.  The pools are great and the overall ambiance is amazing. When you visit vegas be sure to stop in and see the Liberace displays stunning. Defiantly would recommend this hotel and the staff are hospitable.
I've never stayed here but man do I want to. This place is beautiful.  This is on my list of places to stay.
Cosmopolitan is probably my favorite Vegas casino resort to go to. I love the glam and glory decor in the casino area and the wide variety of restaurants to choose from.  We got the Wraparound Suite this time - the room was very spacious with two full bathrooms, great night view of the strip, but its furnitures were a little worn down and not exactly the quality that matches Cosmopolitan's glam lobby. This is really a great room for hosting small parties - a bar top, large seating area, and a balcony that can fit at least 20 people. They provide full toiletry and slippers, all good quality! However, the housekeeping can do a better job - our bed sheet had cigarette-burnt holes and the pillows on the sofa smelled like old greasy hair. Overall staff service was excellent, from check-in to internet troubleshooting on the phone!
I won a two-night stay here courtesy of HBO. I'm not at all what you'd consider hip or one with even a fair amount of money, so I worried the hubby and I would stick out like sore thumbs and would be looked down upon by the staff. This was not the case AT ALL! Everyone was polite and helpful, from the check-in attendant to the casino waitresses to the room service delivery. I truly felt as though I fit in there. I've never stayed at a hotel where I've not had at least a complaint or two, but I literally had no complaints about The Cosmopolitan. My husband and I are already planning on saving for another trip!
Stayed sunday-tuesday 6/8-6/10/14 Studio King w/o the view was a great room. View was facing Planet Hollywood, didn't pay the extra for the Bellagio fountains view. But the room was still amazing. Definitely worth the money. I was told they were supposed to be condos but something happened in construction and it became a hotel/casino, So the rooms are very nice! Lost two stars becasue of five things: The Sports book was hella small & they give any drink tickets for betting on games. The pool was full by 9am - on a monday - so there was nowhere to sit in the sun/remotely close to the pool. From what I could see, there was minimum $15 blackjack tables at all times. I understand how it works with the tables but It would have been nice to be able to afford to gamble at the hotel I'm staying at. No poker room and dining was limited to a few spots. Nothing great though. Prime location smack dab in the middle of the strip! Probably gonna look for a hotel/casino with better sports book, poker room and dining next time
Is this place selfie worthy?  Why, oh yes!!!. . I didn't think I would like this place because I hate their commercials.  I feel like swinging punches when I hear that awful club music...but anyway, this place is actually gorgeous!  Weird and gorgeous.  Class meets obnoxious, that's the best way I can explain the decor.. . The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a very perfume-y aroma, it smells luxurious and clean...not like a Vegas casino. We walked by the Book and Stage bar.  It is a lounge with a Library theme, and you can count on the Cosmo to make a library look hip and cool.  The books are not real, but projections of books on glass walls and pillars.  Awesome!  . . The hotel has all kinds of nooks and lounges to rest your feet, with plush seating and gorgeous, rich colors.  The Vesper bar reminds me of a barSuperman would go to.  It reminds me of his icy lair.  We've found several giant stilletos and a group of dog statues on the same floor.  So unusual and memorable!  Strangers (drunk at noon, like us) were egging me on to get in one of the giant stilletos and pose for pictures, I'm surprised I didn't fall out!!. . The Chandelier bar is the heart of the hotel, it is definitely a must see when you go to Vegas.  I've also heard of the Secret Pizza lounge, but we were already too messed up from the drinks at the Wicked Spoon and at the Chandelier bar to find it.  I heard it's inside a hallway with vinyl records and that the pizza is the bomb!  Too bad we didn't find it, but we will definitely check it out next time!
Came here for a friends bachelor party and we were able to get the wrap around suite facing the Bellagio fountain. It was an amazing room. Excellent view, 1200 square feet, 2 bathrooms, 2 shower stalls, 1 spa tub, able to fit 2 roll away beds, and a small kitchenette with Sub Zero fridge! Most importantly, the walk around the balcony was amazing. Service was excellent. We did have to negotiate certain terms and management was relatively accommodating. I would definitely stay here again. They even had 2 thermostat controls and 2 flat screen TVs for the suite. The king size bed was amazing. No issues falling asleep and extremely comfortable. The mattress was company was Serta. Wifi was free and decently fast. Only issue with the place was the checkout. We couldn't checkout via the TV. . . In terms of gambling, this place lacks poker tables and it isn't really a "hardcore" gambling place. I would go to other places were the tables are cheaper and with more variety. . . There are TONS of parking spots. I would recommend self-park to save yourself some money. . . Best place I've stayed at so far. I'll have to compare this suite to others in the future.
I love the way this place looks from the outside at night. The inside is interesting and pretty to look at but difficult to navigate. We did not stay in the hotel but came looking for the elusive "Neapolitan" and after an hour left defeated and irritated. The three staff people I asked about it looked at me like I was crazy and responded that they had not heard of it. It is listed on the Cosmopolitan website.  We finally discovered that the fourth floor was locked off for a concert and we suspect it was on that floor but still not sure. Disappointed.
Ill be short if your twenties thirties and  hot you found a place. If you are over 40!look eleswhere. Hotel a masterpiece beautiful in every aspect. Over 40 you will not fit in go eleswhere.One star less no  ..not a fan of vertical concept...
I REALLY wasn't impressed by this casino! The dancing girls were in leotards really ahaha ... I thought I was in Vegas! More T&A please!. Also the dealer was too strict ... asking for id and wouldn't let me use my phone at the table ... I get most places don't allow that either but she was just like super attitude about it! And over all I just didn't get excited to be in this casino...only thing I liked were the giant high heels lol . And the wicked spoon was so disappointing ... I feel like there is a lot of hype about this casino ... but when you get here you're like meh.
Some of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed at in Vegas. Even the base rooms are huge, with comfy beds and bedding, desks with built in everything (USB chargers, ports to hook up your laptop or other devices to the TV, etc.), huge bathrooms and shower. The rooms are definitely 5-star. The only place they lose points is the pool areas. Marquee is way too clubby, and the Bamboo pool is tiny for such a huge resort. And a $400 minimum on food & beverage for one of the beds is just ridiculous.
Best resort on the strip with the best customer service.  Sexy vibe and not cheap.  Come here if you are looking for luxury, not a deal.  Upgrade to the wraparound suite.  I did and I'm hooked!
My favorite hotel in Las Vegas hands down (next to Aria which is a close second). I'm a 20-something professional woman and this is perfect for girls and guys like me! It's modern, luxurious, hip and the crowd is gorgeous! No trashy white girls here getting white girl wasted (head on to Wynn or Hard Rock if that's your idea of a fun time). . . The staff is great! I love the decor of the hotel. It's flashy and hip but not in a Vegas kitschy way. If you love W Hotels, then this is the place for you. The rooms are gorgeous!. . Pros:. Great Staff. Elegant Modern Decor. Good Music. GoodFood. Great nightlife. Location. . Cons:. Small Casino . Always Loud (but hey its Vegas!). . . Great for: Couples looking to party and have fun sans children. Bachelor/Bachelorette parties, girls/guys get away weekend. People in their 20's, 30's and maybe 40's. Great hotel for people who really want to party or lounge but not rave with 21 year old spring breakers.
LOVE LOVE cosmopolitan! Almost every hotel/casino on the strip has a theme, but I'm still trying to figure out Cosmo's. It's sort of like stepping into the twilight zone or something, I can't really put my finger on it. Anyway, the hotel is super chic yet classy w/ a bit of old school dapper days and is geared toward people in their mid 20's. It's really distinct and my bf loves how it just stands out on the strip at night (the dark blue lights make it look so mysterious and calming). . The layout inside might be confusing 'cause there are a couple of floor levels that contain just huge empty space, not sure why. A lot of things in this casino seem to be hidden. Ex: the buffet is located like on the 3rd floor in the middle of nowhere in a corner. They have the secret pizza joint that's hidden also.. . The rooms aren't a bad deal either and most come w/ the nice balcony which is a big plus when you're on a vegas vacation. Very clean and the Japanese bath tub is siiiick. You can chill on the balcony w/ your drink at night and enjoy the bustling busy lights on the strip!
First time staying at the Cosmopolitan and it will probably be the last. There were highs, but there were also a LOT of lows. . . Check-in:Two minute wait. Originally booked Terrace Studio - asked if we want to upgrade to view of The Bellagio Fountains? Well, absolutely. Yes, please. Very friendly and helpful staff.  . . The room: Nice size, huge private terrace with the MOST FANTASTIC VIEWS I've ever had in a Vegas room. But the room itself - nothing particularly impressive about it. Can't compare to the two room suite at THEhotel or the high tech rooms at the Aria. Took off my sandals and what?...is the carpet wet? Eww! Right outside the bathroom area - did something overflow? OMG! Then walked to the "bedroom." Carpets wet there as well. OK, called front desk - "The carpets in my room are wet. Did they by chance get cleaned today or something?" "Let me check...yes mamm...today at 3:15." Huh. They disn't have another Terrace Studio w/ View available...or oddly the one without the view we had just upgraded from. The only option was to upgrade to the Terrace Suite and they weren't sure if we would be willing to pay the difference in price. Uh, no! The gentleman was very apologetic and gave us a $100 food and drink credit. Still didn't change the fact we walked around on damp carpet for 2 days, but the person was really nice and apologetic. . . The room cont. - housekeeping/maintenance: Could have been cleaner for sure. A random hair on the half wall that separates the living area from the bedroom. More hairs in the bathroom vanity drawers - gag! There was a lipstick stained cig butt on the balcony that wasn't mine. Realized after the first night's sleep, the sheets had those little balls all over them that happen when they get old (what's that called?). The sink drain in the "kitchen" area had obviously never been cleaned. The filthy drain was hidden by the sink stopper. Having only been open for 3 years, the room certainly was a little worse for wear. Wallpaper in the WC already peeling and carpeted entry to every room door so soiled it almost looked like it was supposed to be deep grey color it was. Speaking of doors, the doors to the room literally weigh ~100 lbs and despite their heaviness they are far from soundproof as all you here day and night is the slam (and feel the bam) of neighboring room doors slamming shut. Oh, the building was originally built as condominiums but bought out by Marriot (yup, Cosmo is a Marriot hotel - didn't know that) and turned into a casino...so there was a nifty little dishwasher in our "kitchenette" if we found the need. I met a gal at the pool who had a full size washer and dryer in her room. The Cosmo never bothered to remove the condo items. Hmm...  . . Room service: Who gets room service in Vegas? This gal, because I have to have my eggs first thing in the a.m. and I'm not dragging my ass down to a restaurant before at least brushing my hair - plus I had to use up those room credits. Fast delivery, very friendly staff, food A-OK but very inconsistent. Ordered the same thing two days in a row and cooking and preso were completely different. . . Restaurants: Couldn't say. Didn't dine at any because 1.) none really looked appealing compared to all of the thousand choices around us and 2.) I hadn't heard good things about any of them, and 3.) we had several free events to attend. Oh wait. I lie. My husband and I did each get a slice of pie from Secret Pizza one VERY late night. It was A-OK. . . Casino: Comparatively small. Mostly slots, not a lot of tables. Lowest Blackjack I found was $25 a hand. I guess I can't really complain though because my "luckiest person in the world" husband landed some $$$$ on the slots during our last night. :) Great drink service. Always around and super friendly. . . The Spa: Very pretty, natural stone walls...tiny! Got nothing on the Wynn! One hot tub, dry sauna, wet sauna. BUT, if you don't have any treatment done it is only $30 for a day pass - others are typically ~$75+. Again, great customer service. Are you noticing a trend here yet? . . The pools: Three to choose from. All are pretty small and boring (got nothing on Mandalay Bay). And, after about 2pm in June no direct sun because of the surround buildings casting a shadow. All three on different floors - just poor design. Lots of people (including) me walking around, changing loungers, to try to get an extra 10 mites of vit D. Towel guys and gals, and poolside servers really nice.  . . Overall: Very nice customer service all around (expect at the Chandelier where the bartenders are not only lazy, but also pompous asses). Great location in the heart of The Strip (City Center) and breathtaking views. BUT, compared to the dozen+ comp for price Casino and Resorts I've stayed at in Las Vegas...the Cosmpolitan would, sadly, not be at the top of my list. Honestly, this should be closer to a 2 star review, but all of the nice staff...and  the view, oh the view!
My new husband and I (Married last Saturday!!) went to Las Vegas for our 4 day long Honeymoon. We both just took new positions within our companies and knew a month long trip wasn't realistic at this time so we decided on a few days of fun in Las Vegas. We were greeted shortly after walking into the Cosmopolitan by Michael who was WONDERFUL! He was so kind and friendly and made us feel awesome. We ended up upgrading from a great room to a spectacular room! Our room was on the 65th floor and was facing the Bellagio and Planet Hollywood. It had a HUGE balcony and was exquisite in every way!! My husband and I could not have had a better experience. The following day Michael called our room around noon to make sure we were happy and ask if the newlyweds needed anything else. We couldn't believe the professionalism and courtesy that was shown to us.. We have only amazing and wonderful things to say about the Cosmopolitan and this is the only hotel we will stay in from now on when we visit Vegas. Even at checkout we got stellar service which was quick and wonderful.Thank you! Thank you! Thank you to the staff of the Cosmo :) We will be back!!
I'd heard many horror stories about this hotel: from barely legal party goers puking in every corner to the impossibility of getting into clubs or having to fork out a small fortune for the rooms, I was terrified about booking the place for BFF's bachelorette party and braced myself for disappointment.  With everyone in our group the wrong side of 30, which is like 80 in Cosmopolitan years, we worried about spending a weekend among thousands of hormonal himbos and bimbos cramping our relatively elderly style!  But I am beyond thrilled to report that almost every fear was laid to rest.  Here's why: . . Customer service was outstanding - the room was ready when they said it would be - roll-away bed was provided at no charge- extra towels and supplies were provided on time and with no issues, check out took mere seconds - everything was just so shockingly effortless I never wanted to leave!   I've been to Vegas many maaaany times, much to my bank account's despair, and have literally NEVER experienced such an easy check-in/out process.  It was absolutely fantastic.  . . The room cost a pretty penny but it was super luxurious and clean and with the bill split between the group, not too outrageous.  There was a huge balcony, incredible views, two bathrooms and a full kitchen, on top of all the standard features. . . Their buffet food (yes I like buffets, whatever!) was surprisingly good quality - not inexpensive but I highly recommend the brunch -it's wildly popular and the lines can be crazy but totally worth it; if you go early enough there is very little wait in fact. . . The Bamboo pool seemed a little tame for our taste, but the Boulevard pool was awesome - we got a day bed for $1,000 which included unlimited food and drinks.  Again, split 5-ways this ended up being great value for money - we spent the entire day lounging by the pool, eating and drinking as if we had been subjected to months of starvation.   . . The Marquee day/night club was magical - truly, if you somehow manage to get your name on the list and so avoid waiting in line, it is well worth a visit - loved the music, loved the setup, loved the whole experience.   Of course it gets very crowded and drinks are expensive but that's just Vegas for you.. . The one disappointing feature here is the casino section.  After all the great work and effort on the interior design, on the food, on the rooms, the pools, the clubs and every other feature of this amazing hotel, the casino seems pretty shabby in comparison.  It has this inescapable ghetto vibe which completely contradicts the rest of the place - claustrophobic and uninviting it is easily the most inferior part of the whole thing - which is a great pity because I actually enjoy spending an hour or so flushing my money down the slot machines once in a while.  . . The cosmopolitan is party central for sure and as such not a destination for pure relaxation, but it's a super fun, hip and trendy venue, still successfully hanging on to its cool factor and managing to enthrall and engage in ways that was really unexpected for me.  . . Enjoy your stay!
Recently stayed at their Terrace Suite for work related convention, a total of 3 nights, 4 days. And was both impressed and disappointed. Impressed because the room was beautiful, nicely designed. But disappointed because there was this constant feeling that the hotel was nickel and dimming the guests for every little thing! Here is the list:. . - if you want the Bellagio view, it's extra, this is called the "premier view". . - if you want to use the gym, it's an extra $25 daily fee, not included in their resort fee, as we found out the hard way. . -you want internet connection? It starts at an extra $15 per day, also not included in the resort fee as they claimed to be. Also learned the hard way when we checked out.. . -if you go to Marquee pool and would like to sit down on one of their pool reclining chairs, be prepared to dish out $200. Yes, that's right. We checked out this pool on a Thursday (no pool day club), the place was dead yet they required you to purchase a minimum of $200 in drinks if you would like to recline yourself in one of their chairs...what a joke. I'm 5'2 130 lbs, how am I to consume $200 worth of drinks by myself? Complete rip off.. . In conclusion, Vegas is a place you don't go unless you are willing to spend a good amount of $$$. But let's just put it this way, out of all the hotels I've been to in Vegas, this hotel has been the most notorious for squeezing out every last cent out of their guests. I mean if you are already charging an arm and a leg to book a few nights, is it really necessary to nickel and dime your customers for every single little thing? Just saying.
It's pretty amazing property - Nice clean and spacious rooms - As a platinum member I was taken care off well by the property - They gave me an upgrade to 32nd floor with a strip view - They are bit pricey -
+1 Star from previous stay.. . Service overall definitely stepped up their game. Few things changed since my last visit here. . . Check in was amazing. Super fast and got the friendliest front desk person ever. He assisted me with a smile and was able to accommodate all of my requests.+1. . Got the wrap around for the 3rd time this year. This time it was definitely the CLEANEST out of all the times I stayed there. +1 star.. . Spoke with Nikola M from the concierge desk before my arrival and he delivered everything that he had promised and SOME +1. . While gambling at night I will still hold my word that this casino might not be the biggest but it has the nicest dealers IMO. The cocktail servers did not disappoint either. The only thing that I was missing was the Poker room. I hope they build one soon.  +1. . The only reason why this is NOT a 5 star review is due to the fact that upon check out my points were used without my consent to comp the mini bar. I would rather pay the fee for the mini bar than use my points. I was almost a gold member when I checked in and now I am barely a sterling. The way it was presented to me that I would get the mini bar comped because I played quite a bit this stay. Never mentioned using my identity points towards the mini bar bill...:| -1 star. . Overall thou this hotel still takes my #1 spot on the list. You cannot beat the location. You cannot beat the service and you definitively cannot beat having a balcony in your room.. . Coming back June 29th...will keep you posted!. . Cheers!
I absolutely love this hotel and I loved my stay here!!!! This place is beautiful!! I was lucky enough to get a suite with an outstanding view all to myself for a week here and oh my gosh, I felt like I was in heaven!!!! I was in Vegas strictly for Business so I didn't pay much attention to everything else in this hotel (casinos, shopping stores, clubs, bars, etc.) but I highly recommend getting a suite at this hotel anytime you're in Vegas whether it is for business or pleasure! You won't be disappointed!
easily one of the WORST Vegas hotel experiences I've EVER had.  booked a room with 2 queens.  called 1 week prior to trip to confirm over the phone that I would be getting a room with 2 queens since I'd be traveling with 2 young children.  everything was confirmed.  rep assured me they'd have a room w/2 queens bed ready for me.  come check in time at mid night, front desk was unfriendly and proceeds to tell me they ran out of rooms w/2 queen beds.  asked if they could put me in terrace room with 1 king and they'd bring in a double rollaway.  fine.  get up to the room, they bring in a single rollaway.  maid service informs me it's against fire code to have double rollaways in room.  so either front desk rep lied or didn't know his company's policy.  I call front desk to inform them that the single rollaway would be too small to fit both me and my wife.  the manager, anthony tells me I can sleep on the couch.  then threatens me that he should be charging me additional occupancy fees for individuals in excess of 2 adults.  I educated him that on Cosmo's website, the policy is to charge for adults in excess of 2.  add occupancy fee does not apply to children.  he says he'd never heard of that before.  another example of staff not knowing company policy.  spent another 10 mins on the phone with Anthony trying to understand why they couldn't fulfill my original reservation and all I got was "I can send someone with sheets for you to sleep on couch.  finally at 2am, I gave up.  not impressed with hotel.  even less impressed with hotel staff and service provided.  will never stay here again. for manager Anthony, see your company's policy below.. . "ADDITIONAL PERSON CHARGES. Maximum occupancy is four persons per room. Additional nightly fees apply for reservationswith more than two adults. An adult is defined as an individual 18 years of age and older."
I went to Vegas for my bachelorette party and we stayed in the City Suite. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning! And our City Suite? To die for! Making the reservation was super easy and the communication was great. I requested early check-in and they gave it to us. . .  When my Matron of Honor called to get some help for their concierge; they were very helpful and gave us many suggestions. .  We went to one of their 4 pools. This is where the service went a bit sour. The gentlemen that greet you, weren't helpful at all. We were barley greeted and didn't know where to go. Apparently you had to pay to sit somewhere; which we were not told. Finally, after walking around and looking dumb, we went back to the guys and they finally explained what we had to do. Great...thank you for letting us know NOW! And not when we first walked in.... .  The pool is STUNNING! The bartenders...suck. I've been a bartender and server for a long time and it was THE WORST customer service I've ever had. My group contained 7 (very attractive) girls and it was impossible to get a drink...wasn't even busy. The bartender was complaining to us that he didn't want to be there and kept talking about how he wanted to leave to bet on the game and go to the gym. Not what we, your customers, want to hear buddy. You sound like a tool. He also made fun (and not even in a witty, playful manner) of our Chicago sports teams (where we are from). . .  We bought SO many drinks from them, rounds of shots...and didn't get a free drink at all!! Come on! I'm the bride! I take care of you, you take care of me. Nope. He could care less. He just wanted to get out of there. The pool could have gotten SO much for business from us, had they friendlier bartenders. . .   We went to STK for dinner which was fabulous. Complete opposite experience from the pool. The hostesses were sweet and professional. Our server was fantastic and so on top of it. We were in a rush to go catch a show, and he completely took care of us. The food was SO good!. . The casino is nice...but the management and some of their employees are really rude. One of their employees actually said something inappropriate and rude about me. Myself and the girls I were with were absolutely shocked and went to go talk to the manager. He also, just as rude. He was not taking us seriously. Very disappointed in the casino.. . All in all, I do like this hotel. It's gorgeous and the front desk staff is great. I would NOT use their pool or their casino. I'd go somewhere else =). . Hope this was helpful!
I stayed here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and upgraded to a wraparound since I decided to go big on this visit, lol. It was pretty bad ass. I was on the 22nd floor right above MDC.
I had the opportunity to be able to stay at The Cosmopolitan this week after being comped a room for two nights. All I have to say is that this hotel is absolutely amazing!. . The staff is top notch. They were attentive and always smiling. I felt that they truly go out of their way to help you have a great experience.. . The room was BEAUTIFUL. Had an amazing view of the Bellagio's water show from our balcony, the bathroom was huge with a shower fit for two and a luxurious tub. . . The beds were comfortable, as were the rest of the furnishings. . . The casino is about as lavish and stylish as it gets. Each section of the casino has it's own flair, from a gigantic gorgeous crystal chandelier that hangs down multiple stories of the casino to my favorite, The Vesper Bar, where the best mixologists work tirelessly behind the bar to make the best cocktails in Vegas. Just give them even the vaguest description of what you like and the'll concoct something that will knock your socks off.. . If you ever have the opportunity to stay at the Cosmopolitan, I HIGHLY suggest that you make it happen!
This hotel is amazing!! I've stayed here a couple of times, and love the rooms and location. My favorite part is that the rooms have a balcony, and if you're lucky, you get a room facing the Bellagio fountains!! The view is beautiful during the day and at night!. . The only thing is that I feel like all the rooms are centered around the shower. It's designed for a couple, cause the showers are very open and have windows that look into the bedroom or the balcony. It makes sharing a room with friends a little difficult lol. And the bathroom doors don't lock, just FYI. . . And check out Secret Pizza and Holsteins while you're there!
from the 22 untill the 27 I had the pleasure of staying at the cosmo a treat for my 50 birthday we had an amazing time the room,the service was all 5 stars the best meal came from stk service and atmosphere wonderful I was up on the 67 floor in a one bedroom terrace the hotel located right in the middle of the strip get a bus pass and take the duece any where allday up in down the strip. Now the only one downfall was when we checked in which went really quick they asked us for a 750 deposit that we get back we had already paid for the room so thought that was odd but with no charges to room you do get it back all except a 28 dollar aday fee but a wonderful experiece
Beautiful designed hotel inside and out. A lot of attention to detail. Stayed in the Terrace One Bedroom. Fantastic view facing the strip. Derrick at the front desk was very friendly and helpful while checking us into our room. Our hotel had a Japanese soaking tub. What a relaxing amenity! We will only stay at the Cosmo when we go to Vegas. Fantastic customer service and a modern hotel!
I like this place. Despite the hour wait to check in. Our room is beautiful. And when we went to get our rewards card, the gal there listened to us about how we had to wait and hour and gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for the Wicked Spoon buffet. CL was really happy about that. We got the one bedroom terrace view room.
I've stayed at the Cosmopolitan twice now and can't say I'm overwhelmingly pleased.  . . High points: . -Very friendly and accommodating front desk staff. It was truly a pleasure dealing with them. . -The food at Wicked Spoon is DELICIOUS. You will never run out of options. . . Low points: . -The cleanliness and condition of the room and hallway was unacceptable. The carpet in the hallway was very stained and I could tell that our room was beat to hell and never recovered.  It really needs a deep cleaning and touch up.. -The elevators move at a glacial pace. . -The bell boy we dealt with was completely rude and treated us like were idiots for choosing to drive back to Los Angeles at the time we did. . -The process for picking up your car from valet is a nightmare. I felt like I was in an overcrowded bus station in the holding room that had NO AIR CONDITIONING. It was miserable and took about 30 minutes to get our car. . . Overall, the only reason I would return to the Cosmopolitan was if I got a great deal on a room to make up for all of its shortcomings.
Definitely one of my favorite hotels on the strip. . Their rooms are spacious and luxurious! I've stayed in their regular rooms and their wrap around suite. . The beds are so comfy it's like you're sleeping on clouds. The suites come with a kitchen so bring food to cook when you get the drunchies at 4am. There's also two bathrooms which is a life savor when you have a few more people staying in your room.. The view is what makes this hotel 10/10. You alwAys get a beautiful view
I love this hotel. My host jay invited me over to their hotel over my bday weekend and told me room and food was taken care of. When my wife and I check into our room, they set us up in a wrap around suite. If you never been in one of these rooms, it's a must. I estimate 1500sqft, 2 bathrooms, separate bedroom and L-shape  balcony which can fit 100 people overlooking the Bellagio water show and the Las Vegas lights. The hotel is truly cosmopolitan.
