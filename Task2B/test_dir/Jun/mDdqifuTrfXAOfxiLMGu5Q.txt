Okay, this is the most honest review  you will read.  My husband and I walked in off the street, no reservations. We were seated immediately . Donnie was our waiter and could not be more enjoyable. He made the experience even more enjoyable. After looking at the menu we decided to go with the Hells Kitchen experience. I don't normally eat eggs but the Scotch egg was thoroughly enjoyable. I am not a beet person but the beet salad was not all that bad, then came the good parts, the scallop risotto was to die for but only got a half portion, also the beef Wellington is all the hype they put with it...I have never enjoyed a meal as much as this one. The toffee pudding was also the most enjoyable thing I have ever tasted.  I could not even finish my dessert.. . ....now for the reason that I did not give 5 stars....the price of the Hells Kitchen experience was $145 per person...which was okay by me...until the portions came out half...half a scallop risotto, half a beef Wellington. It costs us over $400 for 2 of us and we only got half portions of the food we so craved.  . . We did walk out of there full, fat, and happy...but for $400 I would have liked to have some take home food.... . The experience as a whole...I walked out of there with a grin from ear to ear, I have 2 signed pictures of Gordon Ramsay and the reminisce of the meal still lingering on my mind.  I will eat here again but this time I will get my full portion of beef Wellington. . . As for our server Donnie, he was a delight and I would request him to experience the same feeling I had the first time. . . I recommend if you have a couple dollars to splurge definately try Gordon Ramsay steak!!!
SO good!! The filet is amazing!! The truffled Mac and cheese is life changing it's so good. Oh my gosh, the carrots, I think they were chicken BBQ carrots or something, they were amazing! Went another time and tried the Brussels sprouts but thought they were just okay. I like mine a certain way tho, so could just be me.
Came here for dinner with coworkers a few weeks back. The food is solid and the service was great but overall the place is just OK in my opinion. We went the whole 9 yards and tried multiple appetizers, entrees, and deserts. Nothing memorable. It was good but nothing really blew me away, which I was expecting from a place with Gordon Ramsay's name on it. . . This place is good, but not worth planning a trip around.
This place was the best of my whole trip to vegas!!!  It was a special event for me and my wife and the waiter was so excellent Yvone was his name and the manger on shift that night even through in his help and cleared our appetizers before our next course of the most excellent meats vegas has to offer. The host might start off walking you in talking about chef Ramsey and the his hands shaped out of neon lights on the ceiling which is a somewhat focal point but it blah blah. Don't worry it gets so much better after that. I love this place and I'm not some bug Ramsey TV watcher or a British follower. A++++ you must go it's located in the Paris hotel/casino area. Make a reservation though with them over the phone or on open table.com
Love love love! Delicious! I have always been a fan of Chef Gordon Ramsey. I was so looking forward to eating here. It really is worth it to treat yourself to his brilliant menu. . . Our waiter and his assistant waiter was amazing. Yes, they have assistants. Lol. Anyways, back to the awesomeness. . . I had the HK drink and I loved it. It was light and not super sweet. The bread was just the best bread ever. So many different types as well. We had two plates of it while waiting for our food. . . After debating on what to eat from the menu, I ordered the famous beef Wellington. It was WOW! It's hard to describe it, but it was executed so well! Perfectly cooked. So worth it. My bf had one of the steaks, so many types of cuts to choose from! . . Overall, so happy we dined there!
The food was good here. We got the tasting menu which was a total rip off.  The only reason why we got it was to eat the risotto. At $145 a person (we had 2 people), I was expecting bigger portions. . .  The first item was a qual egg which was eaten in 1 bite. Followed by a beet salad which again was finished in 2 bites. Then the risotto which Iw as excited for because im a HK fan. It was so tiny, we finished it in about 3 bites. It was just a little more than a spoon full and it wasn't good at all. it was normal risotto.. . Next came the wellington which was good followed by their signature dessert which was awesome. So the lesson learned... I spend $300 on the tasting menu when I could have just ordered the wellington and dessert and it would only cost me $140.. . The bread they give is very good. There were 3 types.  And we got 2 servings because its free.. . So long story short, avoid the tasting menu, the risotto sucked and just get things ala carte.
Gordon Ramsey definitely knows how to do it! His Beef Wellington has officially, and scrumptiously devoured off my bucket list, it was everything it has been cracked up to be! The flavors, the texture, wow it was all but perfect and of course the staff I compare to a well produced broadway play! Actually i believe running restaurants is similar to a live play, the servers should always be "on", helpful and attentive regardless what shambles their personal lives may be in. They should never bring that to work.  A good manager is like the director making sure each element of the production goes according to the overall enjoyment of the paying audience and well by know you can begin to see the similarities. And Gordon's Steak was a wonderful, delicious and completely enjoyable performance by his entire cast. It was $55 and I would have been happy paying more for it, to me it was that good! I must add that since i ate alone i didnt try any other dishes, the bread plate and the Wellington were more than enough to satisfy me so this review is really about that one dish and the service!
A group of us gathering for a reunion were all so excited to eat here as we are all huge Gordon Ramsey fans. So we were very disappointed that the food was all very bland which would have been fine had there been salt and pepper on the table. We couldn't visit or catch up at all because the music was very very loud and we had to yell but still couldn't hear. So I really wouldn't recommend trying the place as it is really expensive and with all of us sampling each other's dishes we were all disappointed.
I usually go to Craft Steak for dinner but I wanted to try a different steakhouse. My mistake. The bread plate is good, you get 4 different types of bread and they are all good.  . . For dinner I ordered the porterhouse (med) the chicken breast, mac and cheese, asparagus, and fingerling potatoes.  . . When our meal came they brought us the long bone steak (I think it was the rib-eye) all of our side dishes were also being brought to the table.  We told them that steak was not what we ordered and they took everything away.  We were starving by the time they brought the food but they took it all away to make the correct steak. Honestly I think they should have just left the (incorrect) steak and the right side dishes and made the porterhouse. I was very worried that they would just throw our side  dishes and chicken under a heat lamp but i am pretty sure they didn't.  So when the porterhouse came out it was med rare.  We were starving so we ate it.  When the server came he asked how everything was and it was OK. The potatoes were my fav then the chicken.  I was honest with the server and told him the steak lacked seasoning and was under cooked to my linking.  He offered to i guess throw it back on the grill but that wouldn't make up for the lack of seasoning so I said no. . . Overall, Craft has never disappointed and I should have went there to celebrate my birthday.  I don't think I will ever be going back as the steak was not worth the price.. . Oh yeah make sure you order a dessert or they don't do anything for your birthday.
This place doesn't deserve the Gordon Ramsay name. Very average at best. Waiters talk way too much.  Food is just chain restaurant quality.  Ambiance is non-existent.  And the prices are ridiculously high.
Everything was amazing!
Beefsteak is fabulous, a little bit noisy but the service is very good
Five of us dined and enjoyed the food.  Beet Salads and French Onion Soup were fabulous! Short Ribs, Filet, and Beef Wellington were tender, cooked as requested, and had lots of flavor.  Decor was pleasant and the service was excellent!  As other reviews have stated the music gets amped up way too loud which takes away from really having a fine dining experience.  Fortunately, we had gotten there early and only had to hear the cranked up volume for less than thirty minutes.  Mentioned the volume of the music being increased and was informed very apologetically," that's how they want it."  Poor soul has to listen to it all night!  Personally, I'd like to savor the flavors and conversation with a little less volume.  There are tons of choices in Vegas where locals and visitors can enjoy awesome flavors and a quieter ambiance.
We were excited to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We were caught a little off guard with the ambience. The restaurant is split with a bar on one side and a restaurant on the other. The music was almost club type. Very loud and hard to talk to a significant other across the table.   .   Our waiter was a little pompous and seemed a little condescending. Almost trying too hard to be a Jean-Philippe. The other waiter for another table was really nice and we were a little jealous. Our table was loose and rocked a bit as we ate. We were ok with it. But when he wiped it down and noticed that it moved, he explained how they would have to flip the table and fix it, and blah blah blah. .   Food was great. Everything came out so soft and melted in our mouths. I had beef Wellington of course. Wife had a chicken and rice meal. Finished off with sticky toffee pudding. . Great food, just don't expect a quiet dining experience. Our waiter was snobby but other waiters seamed nice. Food is expensive. Our bill was $240 for two. Water is $8 a bottle. Ask for filtered tap. . Enjoy
We came to Gordon Ramsay Steak to celebrate our 1 year Wedding anniversary 2 days ago and had a HORRIBLE experience. And that is being kind. I ordered the Cesar Salad, which was pretty good; however, I sat with an empty plate on my table for nearly 30 minutes. Then, after waiting 50 minutes to receive our main entree, it came out burnt to a crisp and was so charred that the taste was overpowering. I told our server that the meat was really charred, and his response was that it was supposed to be that way and that he would come back to check on us if it was not acceptable. Needless to say, our server did not come back for another 20 minutes. And he did not offer to get a manager or make it at all better. I ordered a medium New York strip and received a rare one. We then had to hunt the waiter down to get our check, as he was walking away he said, "oh you don't want to order dessert".. . The worst part was that the table next to us had excellent service from our same waiter. He was there every 4 minutes checking on them and talking with them, but didn't come to our table, and would just glance our direction to appear that he was checking in on us, but wasn't. . . I was so disappointed after having this kind of experience at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant; it is still painful to think about it. My husband and I both woke up with horrible stomach aches, along with a bitter taste in our mouths.  I can't believe a man of his caliber would allow a restaurant in his name to operate this way. This is a direct reflection on his management and those he has chosen to empower with his name.
We were put on the second level in a room.  It was noisy, plan on raising your voice and asking the waiter to repeat himself frequently. We asked to switch to the balcony and the sound level was better. They charge you $9 a bottle for water.  Plan on paying an additional charge for sauce and side dishes. This place is all about worshiping Gordon Ramsay as a demi-god. The neon in the atrium representing his hand motions is just silly. The customer is king not Gordon Ramsey. This restaurant missed that point.
Like other reviews on here, we had high hopes and excitement about eating at ramsays steak. We had a group of six and arrived for dinner ready to eat some delicious food that was gonna wow us all. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. It took forever overall and service want great either. It took 20 mins just for bread, every time our water glasses were empty, we had to ask for more......my ordered the beef Wellington and it was good. I had a ribeye steak that was good but was under seasoned in my opinion. I also had a ceasar salad that was excellent onion soup which was excellent but the Mac n cheese tasted only of truffle oil :( a huge let down cause we LOVE macncheese....anyways, more bad....our friend ordered a ny strip steak medium well and when it came out, it was black and I mean black. The waiter told us it was char and was supposed to be that way. Let me tell you, this tasted like charcoal and was not a properly charred steak. She sent it back and the waiter said it would be another 45 mins for another steak. Unacceptable, so we asked for a manager who tried to rectify it by getting another steak out in about 5 mins but unfortunately this time the steak was no more than medium rare and it was supposed to be medium well.... She sent it back again and chose not to order anything else. For an average check of $100-$140 per person, it was def not worth it. I would recommend mon ami gabi in Paris for a steak over ramsays. Won't be back
My wife and I are big fans of Hells Kitchen and we recently got the opportunity to try Gordan Ramsay Steak On June1st .  We had reservations for 6pm and ended up sitting in probably the most busiest aisle there (right next to the stairs).  It was very noisy and kind of a nuisance having meat carts and people running by every 2 seconds. We ordered our food medium-rare for me and my wife wanted hers, medium+ (the waiter suggested that).  We also ordered spinach and a potato ($12.00 ea), which really wasn't worth it.  When we got our meals, after eating some of it, decided that they were not cooked as we asked.  I don't know why we didn't send them back, I think we were just shocked after watching the show, how intense Chef Ramsay is about making sure everything is cooked correctly.  Actually, my steak was a bit stringy and maybe if they cooked it a bit more, would have made it easier to chew.  So, the whole experience was a let down, from the seating to the meal.  $250 for a meal that was only so-so.  We will stick to Mastro's Ocean club for now on.
This was the 2nd time we dined here and this time i took my sisters! We loved it !!! Oscar was our waitor and he was amazing !!! He was very attentive and wished my little sister a happy birthday and congratulated me on my bachelorette party weekend !. . We had the foi gras which was our 1st time and it was amazing !!!. Then we had the beef wellington and american beef cap and those were delicious !!! Worth the money !! We also had the macaroni and cheese and sauteed mushrooms!. . We were sooo stuffed we couldnt try their deserts :(. . But I would definitely come again !!
Very good but very expensive. I hosted dinner here for a group of 8 co-workers celebrating a service milestone. They really do a nice job with groups. It's a large restaurant and very "Vegas" style - impressive architecture, large menus, lots of show. . . The service was great. I really enjoyed our server. He spent time with our table and had a really fun personality. And he was an expert waiter - said he had been in the industry for 10 years and it showed. . . Overall great evening but very pricy.
This place was incredible!  Beef Wellington was far better than the Eiffel Tower located on the same property.  And it was 20% less.  Our entire bill was 20% less ... And the food was much better ... Significantly better!. . Food - 5 stars. Service - 5 stars... Dennis was the best waiter ever!. Atmosphere - 5 stars .. Upstairs is significantly quieter than down. Price - 5 stars... Expensive but food is so incredible it was worth it.. . For dessert, order sticky toffee pudding.   Amazing.. . If you want to go to see the views go to the Eiffel Tower viewing area.  Then go back down to Gordon Ramsey's for the food.  . . The best food in Paris is British!
Fantastic steak house, lived up to the hype (and I am not a Ramsay fan).  They set the tone right by bringing out all the steak cuts on a Vegas-y mirrored display but nothing more beautiful than good beef.. . As a starter, I went with the foie gras.  It was excellently prepared and an ample portion.. . I went with the rib eye cap, American Wagyu.  This is a cut I have been dying to try and it did not let me down.  Incredibly flavorful and I was surprised the 8 oz was enough.  Had asparagus as a side, also very good, liked the pesto preparation which made it interesting.. . Also, wanted to comment on the bread plate.  I am not a bread person but this was incredible.  They gave me 5 different breads (not to choose between the 5 but all 5 were put on the table).  The breads were different from each other and very flavorful.. . Again, a great steak experience.
Fantastic, fantastic, FANTASTIC!. . Yes, I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay.  Yes I love BurGR.  No, I do NOT love Gordon Ramsay Pub.  I'm not opposed to eating there again, but I would sooner save my food space for BurGR for the price-point.. . Steak on the other hand, is on a whole different level.  Some similar restaurants that I can compare it to:  Club 33 at Disneyland.  Watergrill Seafood of Los Angeles, CA.  Texas Land and Cattle of Richardson, TX.  Steakhouse 55 at Disneyland.  Giardina's Restaurant of Greenwood, MS.. . Blew EVERYTHING away that I ever had elsewhere, hands down.   My party shared the shellfish platter for an appetizer, superb.  The ceramic kraken platter holder was a true work of art.  Had the Beef Willington as my course.  Definitely lived up to the expectations I had for Ramsay's finest dish.  I had a side of pan seared foie gras to try as it is not available in California.  The fact that it is not available in California should be a culinary crime in itself.  AMAZING dish for anyone with an expanded palate.  My friend ordered the bone morrow to go with his cut of Beef Wellington, which I tried and am now hooked.  My friend's partner ordered the aged filet with saute mushroom that looked and smelled DEVINE.  I did not try the filet as my dish over-whelmed my meat capacity, which is a feat if you ask my friends and family, but I did try his mushrooms and while I do love mushrooms to begin with, the mushroom there made my eyes light up with joy.  My then-girlfriend ordered the salmon, which even at a medium-well (her stomach was feeling uneasy before dinner), came out perfect.  Not dry, yet moist, full of flavor and she even devoured the seared skin, which is rare for her.. . The service was top notch.  Our server Mike, was attentive and polite.  His recommendations were on point.  The manager stopped by our table and even helped choreograph my surprise to my then-girlfriend...that's right ladies, the proposal.  With the company of great friends, a beautiful atmosphere, absolutely perfect food, how could she say anything but "yes".  Well...she did say yes after crying for about five minutes.  So folks, 4 years of dating her, the daunting secrecy of requesting support from my parents and grandmother.  The coup with the support of her sister to meet her parents for dinner without my then girlfriend knowing, and arranging for the PERFECT dinner under the guise of her birthday with a lot of help from my good friends, I dropped to a knee and she agreed to marry a hoodlum like me.. . Gordon Ramsay and the fine service at Steak, thank you for being the icing on the cake so to speak.. . #littlechef #meerkat
Was absolutely perfect! Wonderful Food, great service, and beautiful atmosphere. One of the best places in Vegas!
Went all out for this meal. A5 Kobe beef, just wow. Melt in your mouth heaven. For sides we had Brussels sprouts, asparagus, Mac n cheese and creamed spinach. All very good. . . Dessert can't go wrong with English toffee caramel cake and brown butter ice cream. Overall amazing!!. . Gordon steak 2/2! Great Job!
I went here with high hopes and was not in the slightest bit disappointed. The waitstaff was very helpful and polite. Our waiter brought by a cart of meat to show us the cuts and explained them to us. We were started with a variety of breads served with smoked salt butter. They were terrific. I ordered the filet and it was great. I've been to other steakhouses and this was to die for. Had haricot vert on the side. It was tempura fried but a little greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't terrible. Also had the creamed spinach on the side which was pretty good. I almost died and went to heaven when I was served dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it was the best thing I've EVER eaten. I would go back a million times just to eat this dessert!!! I left here stuffed full but wanting to eat more! Will definitely go back in the future.
Hmmm, where to begin.  If you like a steak medium to medium well, here is not the place to get it.  You either get a burnt or raw steak.. We all asked for waters to begin with while we read the menus.  I guess that set the tone.  We received our waters and 20 minutes later finally received food menus, but nothing was offered as far as drinks.. Out of the 6 of us in our group, none were impressed.  We had heard so many great things (from TV) so maybe our expectations were a little too high?  Far be it for me to want a medium well cooked steak (yeah I know for the steak that could be seen as an insult) but that's how I like it.  . What I got was literally charcoal on an extremely well done (burnt) steak.  When I put  my fork into, the charcoal literally flaked off.  The servers were kind and offered to have my steak cooked again and I nicely said "no thank you," BUT they insisted.  So I asked for just a bit above medium.  My next steak was so rare in the middle it bled onto my plate.  . My husband and I ordered mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes were $12 and truly nothing special, the macaroni and cheese left us burping mushroom flavor for an hour after eating 2 bites.  . We tried to be nice about everything and were maybe hoping there might be something great in the dessert, but we wouldn't know because we were never offered a desert menu, just our checks.. Fortunately, my steak was taken off, but I feel that $12 on potatoes and average service in a two hour time span is not what I was hoping for nor expecting.  Bummed to say, total disappointment.
So there is a reason why everyone raves about the beef wellington,  it is so tender, soft and delicious it is my new favorite food.  I took my husband here for his bday and had one of the best dining experiences. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.  The food was phenomenal,  but you do have to like truffle oil to fully enjoy everything.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.
One of the best meals I've ever had!   Every dish that came to the table was uniquely and perfectly prepared.  I consider myself cheap.  The meal cost $340 for two, and it was worth it.  . . Excellent service.  Excellent cocktails.  . . I eat out often and I'm always grateful when a restaurant raises the bar.
An English restaurant in the Paris Hotel?  Oh yeah, they thought of that, you cross through the Chunnel to get here! Cute..   . Anyway, if you're a carnivore with any kind of taste for good steak, this place will treat you right.  A bit pricey, of course, but generally worth it.  I had the famous Beef Wellington, and something about it was really strange.  I mean, unique.  There were some flavors I couldn't quite put my tongue on.  None the less, it was fantastic.  IF you go with a group, you can try lots of different stuff to maximize experience.  . . I don't think that my heart can take going back here very often, but it's worth a one-off visit.  I also really like the Paris Hotel, so there is that.
Crazy Bernie is a big fan of Gordon's and puts his money where his mouth is by going into this great spot each and every time he goes to Paris LV about 4x a year. Beef Wellington just like what they make on Hell's Kitchen is out of this world. Got to meet chef Christine the first time I went soon after she won the head chef position.  Highest quality food with prices in line with quality level. When you say no to Gordon Ramsey Steak....you say no to life!
Admittedly I'm a Gordon Ramsay reality show junkie and I don't eat burgers so this was a must try for me. We enjoyed the 8 Oz fillet and seafood platters. Both were very good. Sides were steamed spinach with creme fresh and a supercharged version of mac and cheese made with blue cheese. VERY PRICY. But everything was great from beginning to end. You only live once so try this one out if you're nearby and can afford it.
Edited - upgraded to a 3 star - it is better than the compared 2 star ratings for other places that I have reviewed - but still was disappointed in the experience, we had higher expectations for a restaurant of this caliber.  Plus, I was contacted by management expressing their concerns of my review and I was impressed with their desire to improve.  I wish more establishments took that initiative.. . I have to admit, we were underwhelmed with our dining experience.  This is due to the fact that it's a celebrity restaurant and high dollar menu and the only item on the menu that we would rave about it the sticky toffee pudding.  That was absolutely fabulous!  We had reservations about 2 months in advance and we were sat back in the corner with not much of a view of the rest of the establishment, except to watch the wait staff gab at their station or people enter and exit and elevator.. . We are fans of the show Master Chef and my husband was dying to try his famous beef wellington.  The menu says it takes 45 minutes, but I think they had a few in the works as it didn't seem as fresh as maybe it should have and didn't feel like it took that long (but we didn't time it)?  Neither of us has had one before, so nothing to compare it to.It was good, but it wasn't amazing, which we expected.  I ordered one of their fish options and it was fishy tasting.  I guess some fish can be that way?  I wasn't super pleased with it, it was edible.  We also ordered an appetizer, the chorizo stuffed lobster as we figured we wanted something to taste while waiting for the 45 minute main entree.  It was probably as big as an index finger?  The flavor was ok, not really sure where the chorizo was.  We also split a very nice bottle of wine which a sommelier helped us select.. . Our server seemed a bit stuffy, literally felt he was scoffing on the inside.  Wish we had the server that was helping the table next to us as he was full of personality and I overheard some good menu suggestions and then wished he was there to help me make my selection (we had already ordered).. . We do not frequent a lot of high end restaurants - probably 2 or 3 a year to treat ourselves.  Unfortunately, I would have to suggest you not to waste your money here (in Gordon's frequently used disappointing statement "damn").  It simply wasn't worth it.
Excellent all the way. From staff to food. I was a little nervous before coming. I dont mind splurging but i dont like to feel like I got taken when I do. Luckily i did not.. . . Service- excellent. I booked through open table and made note in the reaervation that it was our anniversary. The server and hostess wished us a happy anniversary and my husband a happy birthday upon arrival. Serving staff very attentive through out meal. . . Food. . Lobster appetizer. Good not amazing but good. Small for price. . Beef sliders. You get two. Good. . . Beef wellington. Excellent. . Pork chop. Thick juicy excellent. Had to send back for extra cooking but still excellent and and manager came out to apologize. . . Brussel sprouts with little pieces of bacon. Excellent.. . . Fingerling potatoes excellent. . . My room didnt have a fridge but i was definitely taking what i did not eat with me. Too delishous to waste. I nibbled the rest of the night.. . . For 2 appetizers, 2 entres, 2 sides, one soda, one strawberry martini the bill came to $200 which is what I was expecting so it didnt seem that bad.. . . Is the food overpriced? Yes no more so than mortons or ruth chris. Know that going in there and you will be fine.
WOWWW! I love this place. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu. Actually, x2 because they pretty much say that if you order the tasting menu, then the other people in your party will be forced to order the same thing. But other than that, I loved it. My favorites were the Beef Wellington and the risotto. Also, the brown butter ice cream and toffee pudding were amazing.
Second time here....not as good as the first time. I brought a very nice bottle of wine and knew the corkage was expensive...35$...but the wine I brought would have been over $200 here. . . We sat at the bar as we were early for our reservation...my fault. So we ordered the beef Wellington for two to go with our wine....had a glass of a really nice Poulle Fuisee to go with our shrimp appetizer....really good, (by the way the sommelier we had was awesome)...So why only three stars? They told us it would take 45 minutes for the Beef Wellington....but they forgot us and it took almost an hour and a half. By that time we had finished our wine and were ready to walk out. I would have thought the bar tender would haveoffered us a glass of wine on the house but she did not. . . The Wellington was just ok.....under seasoned and for  something that took an hour and a half should have been piping hot....it was not. . . Next time in Vegas I will go to my old standby restaurant at Paris....Mon Ami Gabi...half the price and the food is better.
After visiting many of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants in London, this was a complete let down. I'm not sure how much Mr Ramsey is associated with the restaurant but this was without doubt the worst $250 meal for two we've ever had. The quality of the ingredients was not what you would expect for a al carte. The drinks were the best part of the meal.
I came as a party of 2 on June 8th having made a reservation online. We were greeted by a hostess stand with 5 hostesses standing around. They told us to go wait in the bar. We did, unfortunately there was no place to either sit or stand so we had to exit back to the casino area to wait. We were seated after a few minutes but our hostess was too far in front of us to hear the spiel she was giving on the entryway and lights. . . I was hopeful the experience would improve, however we were seated beside a table of 4 that shared a banquet with our table. Unfortunately one of the diners at that table seemed very intoxicated and was seated so that 3 of their party were on the banquet instead of using the chair. His constant movement made my guest feel like she was in a bouncy castle. The staff did nothing to address this very obvious obnoxious behaviour and continued to serve rounds of shots to them. The restaurant is also very loud making conversation with your own table difficult.. . We ordered apps -- the British ale onion soup and beet salad. Both were excellent as was the warm bread selection. . . Our mains came out surprisingly quickly given the proviso on the menu that the Wellington would take 45 mins. I ordered the filet which was cooked a melt-in-your-mouth mid rare. I also had the loaded baked potato with bechamel. It was fine, but nothing special. My guest had the Wellington which she said was very good , unfortunately the potato puree was ice cold. She informed our waiter who promptly brought a new pot of the puree which was piping hot and delicious. . . Overall the food was good, but hard to really enjoy in the disappointing ambiance.
Love Gordon Ramsay, first off.  My husband and I had the Hell's Kitchen select menu.  Everything was out of this world; my husband couldn't believe he actually ate a beet...and LIKED it.  The risotto was actually slightly undercooked (which made us laugh because GR goes bananas on his shows over mistakes with risotto).  the sticky toffee pudding was amazing; best dessert I've ever had, too bad I couldn't finish it.  . . Waiter was nice, attentive and helpful with suggestions.  He was sweet and put a candle in my desert because he overheard it was our one year wedding anniversary.  Overall, great experience.
I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay . That's why i came here and it DID NOT disappoint me .. . We ordered prime rib and beef wellington. . . I think their prime rib is the best i have ever had in my life in terms of the quality of the meat and the flavour . . However, i am not a big fan of beef wellington. Maybe i just dont like the style. . . Waiter was helping since he recommend us another wine to go with our dishes and said the wine i wanted it was actuallly too dried. I went with his recoomendation and it was great choice.. . However, waiter was way too busy to come to check on us. I would expect the service could be better in this type of the resturant. . . Overall, i love this place.
My wife made reservations for my birthday at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  I ate there a year ago and was impressed, but we were with a group and with conversation, didn't pay attention to the details.  . . For meal, we showed up a little bit early and one of the hostesses informed us that they were getting a table ready and walked us the the bar to a couch to wait.  The bar staff was attentive even though we just ordered water... we had a drink at the Eiffel Tower bar before arriving.  A young hostess found us in the bar area and walked us to our table upstairs that was not what I was imagining for my perfect birthday dinner.  It was a small, two-top table at the exit for the staff area directly outside of the elevator. Our waiter took our wine order and the support staff was very attentive, but it wasn't the kind of table we expected for a fine dining experience.. . Before our sommelier arrived with our wine, the nice young hostess came by to ask us how we liked our accommodations. I told her my concerns about the table and she said she would see what she could do.  We expected a move to a similarly tiny table in a better location.  However, the slender teenaged girl who, despite her age, was a consummate professional, informed us that we were being asked to accompany her to the chef's table.  We were walked back downstairs with the sommelier in tow to a fantastic booth that faced the kitchen and was directly in front of the executive chef's work area (if you were wondering... he doesn't slow all night and catches every detail.. . Our waiter, Chris, was a fantastic waiter.  He was detail oriented yet personal enough to connect while remaining a professional disconnect large enough to make sure that the dining experience was about me and my wife having  wonderful meal together.  He was there when we wanted him to be and was at the edges of the room at all other times in case he was needed.. . The staff was unflappable in all situations and handled themselves professionally.  Assisting Chris was a wait staff assistant that missed nothing.  If water got 1" low, he was there to refill it.  If my wife slipped off to powder her nose and her napkin was neatly folded 20 seconds after her departure.. . Now the food.  My wife ordered the rib cap and a lobster tail.  I ordered the 22 oz bone in ribeye medium-rare with an accompaniment of king crab legs.  We added the mushrooms and creamed spinach.  The steaks were absolutely perfect.  My ribeye was so good I told Chris that it made me want to "smack my mamma."  I'm not sure he's accustomed to that.  I don't like creamed spinach, but I ate all of it.  It was like spinach crack. . . To sum it up, our entire experience here was fantastic and made us feel like we were welcomed and the staff genuinely wanted to please us. I would return every week if it isn't 2000 miles away.//
Gordon Ramsay has done it again! This is the second Gordon Ramsey restaurant I have visited and it was fantastic. . . We had a group of 3 and shared the bone marrow, crab soup, mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, filet mignon, and bone in rib eye. . . All of the food was flavorful and delicious. . . We also tried their popular Hell's Kitchen antioxidant cocktail and it was refreshing and delicious too. . . Overall I would highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you are looking for an upscale dinner.
Besides the great food and wonderful decor..any of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant is never short of..but the staff especially our server Donnie and Mohamadu was exceptional. I would go back just for them. They made our experience just memorable. I learned some French and just had a wonderful time. A great way to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
Sorry folks they all cannot be great, . So after an amazing experience at "Gordon Ramsey Burger" we decided to step it up a notch and try out Steak" Now this first part is strictly my opinion, I feel that in a establishment of this alleged caliber they music should not blare so loud that you cannot have a conversation. The decoration or ambiance was at best gaudy again my opinion. .    We sat for some time, I would say 15 minutes before we were met by the assistant waiter, who after that was amazing. I wish I had gotten his name. When our waiter did show he was Obviously very busy, but was very professional. If this restaurants review was soley based on the staff it would be 5 stars all around. They are the only reason I am giving 2. .    So our first course arrived I had 1/2 dozen oysters my wife had Shrimp. The oysters were good, however we have just returned from New Orleans and these just did not compare at half the amount for twice the price, I was a bit discouraged. The shrimp my wife has was over cooked and chewy. enough said on that..     We were then presented with our salads. I had Caesar, my wife had a garden salad. The Caesar salad was good but he dressing tasted bottled. When I visit a restaurant of this alleged caliber and our final bill is 200 dollars not including our tip I kind of expect a homemade Caesar as I have had at other places. My wife again had a garden salad, in her words "Blah" especially the bacon circles which seemed old... very old..      Now for the Steaks. I have nothing good to say here. I had the Bone in Ribeye. They only compliment I can give is it was big. I ordered Medium rare and received a Very rare steak. It needed among other things seasoning. I do not think an ounce of salt was used in the cooking of this piece of meat along with any other seasoning. Bland is the best way I could describe it. I actually only ate half it just was not good. My wife got the Chicken breast. 1 word "dry" and bland... ok 2 words. Really anything else to say   We were very excited about this visit and left very disappointed. I honestly feel I could have gone up the street to outback and had a better steak for half the price. I am happy most seem to have a great experience sadly ours was not as we would have hoped.
I am surprised that I'm not giving this restaurant 5-Stars.  The service is EXCEPTIONAL but at the end of the day, my wife and I agree we have had better steak.  Don't get me wrong, the steak was AMAZING!  It just doesn't stand out as the best ever (which I guess I felt it would given the reviews and the fact it is Ramsay's flagship Vegas restaurant).  The mac and cheese was nothing special...Very bland.. . I will state it again though...The service was, 'Brilliant!'
