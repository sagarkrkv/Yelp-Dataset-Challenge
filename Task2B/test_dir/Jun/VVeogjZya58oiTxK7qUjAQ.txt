Legendary! Get the Rosa and have them add the wood smoked mushrooms to it.. So good
Best pizza in the country? Nope. . Good pizza? Yes. . . I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleased when the pizza turned out to be pretty good. The crust was nice and bubbled with lots of little black bits around the edges. Good crunch on the rim and a good chew going towards center (that's what she said!). But the highlight for me was their red sauce; not too sweet, just a bit of tang, a little spice, and very well rounded. It really made the pizza for me. Their other "sauces" or lack thereof, left a bit to be desired when alternating bites between pies:. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=tL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8Rw#tL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8Rw. . I was told horror stories of the lines, but we got there just as the opened for lunch on a random week day and the place was empty. I'd go back if in a pinch in Phoenix.
I enjoy thin crust. I loved this place. Crust does not taste like cardboard. Really liked the tomato sauce. I feel it's definitely on the pricier side.  We had the margherita pizza with sausage added. Definitely recommend. My boyfriend likes thick crust pizzas like Chicago style... and he had very positive reviews. Right next to science center and cute area for a date also
Pita Jungle. The food is good,
Great Pizza.  Long wait but it was worth it.
The pizza was great. However the service was horrendous. We were basically sat at the forgotten table where we got no service. Our server spilled my beer and never cleaned it up. Our food ticket got lost and it took 45 minutes and us trying to flag someone down to even get attention. When we brought up that we didn't have food, they acted totally clueless. Then offered us a complimentary salad to make up or it. We didn't want the salad because we weren't that hungry, plus after 45 minutes they finally put some bread on our table. When the pizza came, our server and everyone else ignored us. No manager even came to apologize. So when we got the bill we expected at least 20% off especially since we didn't want the salad. No discount, no server, the hostess brought it to us and therefore, very little tip.
Our friends from N.M. heard good things so we took them here on their last visit. We had tried it before & were only marginally impressed but when friends come from out of town...you know the story. . . Not only were we not impressed again, our friends couldn't see what the fuss was about. The customer service lacks, it's loud, the pizza, pasta & salads we shared were average and that pretty much sums it up. . . We won't go back even if our out of town friends insist but if you like average food and average service at an average price...this place is for you. . . Enjoy!
Delicious! A little overrated but the pizza really is fantastic.
This is very over priced bland pizza...if you can even call it pizza. Went there one time with a co-worker.It  was packed with people and we thought we stumbled on a real gem. Neat renovated old building...but food was really aweful...wont go back.
I've read about this pizzeria in numerous magazines so I was excited to finally make it in.  The bread was good, the pizza was good.  I had the wiseguy definitely different tasting kind of pizza than I had.  The wait staff was a little pushy when asking if we were ready to order, I think he asked like 6 times.  Sloppy when poring my drink and reaching across the table without saying pardon my reach.  Don't go if your a big eater I think I was still hungry when I left haha.  I would go back because the pizza is unique. Hopefully the wait staff is less pushy next time.
Pizza was great, wine kept the girlfriend happy!
So actually tried this place about a year ago, but am just now getting around to posting the review. My Family and I have always wanted to try this place, and have heard countless good reviews from everyone from yelp to the Food Network. While at the Matsuri Festival, we saw it not as crowded as usual and jumped at the chance! The pizza was very good. I knew that people loved it, but I wasn't sure how I would like it. It would definitely be a great place to go to meet up with a friend or have a casual date in town.
Great pizza! Had the biancoverde and it was amazing ! The blend of cheeses is awesome and the arugula on the top is the kick you need to cut trough the richness of the ricotta.. Great service , got a complimentary gelato and it was a really interesting nutmeg flavor, would have never thought of making such flavor in gelato, great call. . Also the establishment is quite charming.
This place is just heavenly, it's a small restaurant with maybe 40 chairs inside and about 20 outside. With usually long long long lines to get a table. I've waited 2 hours before for a seat at the bar, yes it is that good. On this occasion I must have hit a sweet spot, because at 7 PM on a Tuesday night the place was  1/2 full and the bar seating was empty. I waked in and was worried it was closed. Thankfully it was not, just a lull between the storms of guests I guess. By the time I left an hour later it was packed and people were waiting for a seat.. . In any event I started out with an organic salad topped with blue cheese, bacon and house made croutons with a light vinaigrette. It was incredibly fresh, tasty and yummy and got my tummy yearning for my pizza. Sure I could have dined on pizza alone, but hey I need my greens and vegetables.. . Secondly I had the ever popular "wiseguy" pizza. All their pizza's come in one size and can easily be shared with your best buddy, if you like to share. Or like in my case take half home and eat it for breakfast in the morning. The "wiseguy" is a very simple yes incredibly delicious white pizza, with fennel sausage, caramelized onions and very thinly sliced fresh mozzarella. Because the crust is so thin it stays supper crisp and the ingredients get to shine. It's hard to describe why this pizza is so so good, but it just is. I think between getting a pizza with only three toppings on homemade fresh dough, made the way it is in New York has a lot to do with it. The cheese just adheres to the dough and creates this cheese skin that the other topping just stick to. Add that to the char that the wood fired oven creates on the dough, and you have pizza perfection. Plain and simple.
Simply good but long lines...
Yummy, yummy, yummy. Very gormet, cute atmosphere. It's a little pricey though for pizza and soda though. So pricey that I would say a 3.5 star would be more appopriate, but based on the service, and the ambiance, and the flavors of the food they get 4.
***Phoenix's Pizzeria Bianco has greatly influenced the many excellent Italian style pizzerias across the country like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza; I felt the pizzas at Pizzeria Bianco were good though less satisfying than several of the outstanding restaurants it inspired***. . Pizzeria Bianco is one of the country's most celebrated restaurants for pizza.  It won a James Beard award long before many of the Italian style pizzerias featuring high quality, fresh ingredients started popping up in major cities across the country.  This Pizzeria Bianco (there is another location in the Phoenix area) is in Downtown Phoenix and is located just a few blocks away from the city's major sports venues like Chase Field.. . Pizzeria Bianco has a great exterior with its historical looking brick structure.  The inside dining room is fairly small, but it is vibrant and comfortable and showcases a wood burning oven behind the bar.. . In addition to their signature pizzas, Pizzeria Bianco's menu features a small selection of starters and salads.  Pizzeria Bianco's antipasto plate offers a variety of wood roasted vegetables, sopressata and a hard Italian cheese.  I did not really care much for the vegetables.  I felt they were a tad soggy and the broccoli was oddly sweet.  Zucchini and peppers were some of the other vegetables on the plate.. . I really liked the sopressata though.  It was not just a standard salty cured meat.  It had a good salty note, but it also had a bit of spiciness.  The sopressata was also perfectly thin and moist; it combined with the dry cheese and their baguette to make for a great bite.  Prosciutto wrapped figs were also on the antipasto plate.. . I tried a variety of their pizzas.  My favorite would be their margherita.  All of the ingredients were good.  There was a good tomato sauce, nicely melted mozzarella (the right amount too) and fragrant basil.  I did feel those same ingredients shined more at Los Angeles Italian pizzerias like Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive.  I also felt the crust at Pizzeria Bianco was a tad bland.  The crust at Pizzeria Bianco though was uniformly thin and crispy.. . I also had their margherita pizza and added prosciutto and arugula.  This was a good pizza though the prosciutto at Pizzera Mozza has a much more delicious flavor as well as a more satisfying thin and soft texture.  Their Wiseguy pizza with fennel sausage, roasted onion and smoked mozzarella was okay though I personally have never been a fan of pizzas without tomato sauce.. . Service was quick and pleasant.. . Prices are okay.  Given that Pizzeria Bianco is a pizzeria, you are obviously going to be able to dine here at a much lower cost than other highly celebrated Phoenix restaurants, which tend to be more upscale and feature fine dining prices.  Pizzeria Bianco is priced similarly to most Los Angeles Italian pizzerias though it offers more reasonable prices than Pizzeria Mozza.. . Pizzeria Bianco is a good option for Italian style pizza though I have enjoyed other places more for Italian style pizza like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive and Minneapolis' Pizzeria Lola; while Pizzeria Lola does not have the great crust of Pizzeria Bianco, I felt the toppings, sauce and cheese at Pizzeria Lola were all more delicious.  I also thought my recent trip to Los Angeles' order-at-the-counter Pitfire put out a more satisfying pizza.. . Still, Pizzeria Bianco has a lot of history and it has inspired many pizzerias across the country including Pizzeria Mozza.  Given Pizzeria Bianco's similarities to many other Italian style pizzerias found in major metros like Los Angeles and San Francisco, it might not be the best choice if you are only in Phoenix for a night or two.  But if you can try some food that is more unique to Phoenix and still have a few lunch or dinner slots open, Pizzeria Bianco is worth a visit.. . I am not sure what the parking situation is in Downtown Phoenix, but it looks like parking would be easier to find here than downtown areas in other bigger cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.  Pizzeria Bianco also offers valet parking.
The smell of fresh baked pizza, fresher than you'll find anywhere else in Arizona, is amazing when you walk into this place, but that's probably not your first impression of it. On a cool weekend night, you'll notice the long wait for a table; however, go to their building next door for a glass of wine while you wait. If you like your dinner companion, why would you mind? It's a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere, like a barbeque from your friend's back yard. The food is excellent and served for sharing across the table. I recommend it.
I walked into this restaurant, thoroughly enjoyed the meal, and then found out two weeks later on a Yahoo! article that this place was one of the top pizzerias in America.. . Located in a quaint plaza, Pizzeria Bianco is absolutely delicious. I would recommend sitting at the bar. Great friendly service from the bartender. . . I have to say the complimentary olive oil and bread was almost as good as the pizza. I had to stop myself from drinking the whole container of olive oil. With some friends, I ordered the Margherita and the Wiseguy, as well as a Caprese salad. Really fresh ingredients and loud flavors in both the salad and pizza. No doubt in my mind this is one of the best pizzerias in America.
Great service, tasty pizza. I highly recommend going during non-peak hours
wayyyyyyy overhyped. Pizza was just ok, and overcooked to the point of not just blackened but just flat out burnt. The parking sucked, the wait was ridiculous (we went out for an appetizer at Majerle's while waiting and had a better time with better food), and the beverage situation for non-alcoholc drinks was just plain stupid. Atmosphere was way too loud and the waitstaff seemed scattered/discombobulated. Won't be back any time soon, just not impressed enough to bother with it.
Earns the rave reviews it gets. Pizza is amazing.
Seriously the best pizza in America!
