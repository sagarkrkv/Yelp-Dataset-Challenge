Oyster Bar is the BOMB!  . . My husband and I never stayed at Palace Station but we only come here to eat at the Oyster Bar. We ordered the house gumbo, Alaskin calm chowder and the combo pan roast. All delicious! They pack your bowl with tons of seafood. Very filling and satisfying. The bowl is huge which can feed up to 2 people. If you plan to share a bowl with someone, they will charge you an extra $5. A seafood bowl like this, you'd rather want your own because it's so good!  There's only 15 seating. Expect a 1 - 2 hours wait. Friendly staff. Friendly cook.   We'll be back for sure!
So if you haven't been here.. make sure you try it at least once. Thewait is quit long because literally its a bar with maybe 15 chairs and you literally just stand in a line formed at the side.. and stare till someone finishes and leaves. BUT IT IS SOOOO WORTH IT!.. We came here on a Saturday night around 7:00? We weren't seated till 2 hours later plus the time we waited for our food to cook. But honestly, no matter where you go in Vegas, if it's good food.. there will be a wait. So JUST BE PATIENT! . . So if you are willing to wait, you MUST try their Pan Roast.. This is my second time having it and it was even better than the first time! We got the Pan Roast combo that came with shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage and crab at a level 6 spicy. It was sooo good...Each bite was hot and creamy.. MMMM.. They cook it right in front of you so you know it's fresh! Also portion is huge! So definitely share or expect to take some home. We also got their Shrimp Scampi linguini cooked in a white sauce.. This was alright... nothing too crazy about it. The shrimps were HUGE though.. but overall taste was kind of bland to me. I would stick to the pan roast! You will not be disappointed. Many locations in OC tried to open their own knock off of the Oyster Bar.. but no where near as good. If you're in Vegas and don't mind a wait.. COME TRY THIS PLACE!!
Delicious fresh seafood cooked and served right in front of you, the wait is horrendous, but if you're patient, you will be rewarded with one of the best meals you'll ever have. Everything we ordered was terrific, especially the pan roast, cannot miss this awesome dish. The raw cherrystone clams were to die for, so briny and sweet. Service was top notch with Steve & E.Z. they are what makes this place so great.
Tony L. and I were 3 people away and waited around 40 minutes on a Monday morning. Was it worth the wait? Yeaaaaaaaah!. . According to Ricardo (chef), the combo pan roast, gumbo and bouillabaisse are their top three orders. We opted for the combo pan roast and bouillabaisse on our first visit. The portions are generous and well worth the ~$25! . . The combo pan roast is so tasty! Flavorful, rich, creamy lobster based stew with lots of shrimp, crab and lobster meat. I can eat a tub of rice with this sauce. I never had a bouillabaisse before so I have nothing to compare to. But I am sure theirs is definitely one of the best. . . Friendly service! I highly recommend giving this place a try despite the somewhat long wait. Good food deserves a little wait!
Finally I got to try Oyster Bar and I really liked it! I disliked the line I have to wait in but the food is worth it. We had a party of 8 and they let us seat 5 first and the last 3 after people left. We got a dozen oysters that were huge! Definitely worth trying here. I also, got the clam chowder and combo pan with a level 8 spicy that I thought was perfect! My friend got 10 and added habanero (he likes spicy) but I think it was too spicy for him to eat haha. Overall the food is good and this is a must when in Vegas. Ask for extra rolls to go with your combo pan!
Having raw oysters and seafood pan roast for breakfast may sound crazy but I'm not about to put myself in a 2 hour wait just to eat here. So, Imanaged to convince my awesome husband to drive me here after our 12 hour graveyard shift to avoid the long lines. Now, to make this review short and simple, the food was outrageously amazingly delicious, fresh, and so worth it! Get the oysters and pan roast combo. You won't regret it
This is a fun date spot! We sat at the bar, you get to see all the cooking action. I had heard how good the pan roast was so I tried the crab one. It was good, however it was a little too heavy for me. I also had a white wine with dinner. I think next time I'll have a beer and try one of the pasta dishes, when you sit at the bar it can get a little warm from the heat of them cooking, so you really need a ice cold drink.
So far not loving it. 10:40pm and the wait has been 45 mins so far (standing, served no drinks). Doesn't seem like anybody is managing this place. Hope the food is better than the pre-meal experience. No one serving drinks either.  :-( . . Later that evening..... . Food was great...but took about 20-25 minutes to come. Every seat was full (15) the entire time I was there. Chef was great too...working and networking. Had Oysters on the half shell and the house Gumbo. Both really good but the entree portions are big, you could share one.
Who knew about this place and how delicious it would be?!  My bf heard about this place, which is located inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino, and he really wanted to try it, so we went late one night while in Vegas thinking the wait shouldn't be that bad at around 11pm.  Well, we thought we would be clever and order to go, but you still have to wait in line to do that, so we just opted to eat there if that was the case (kinda lame to have to wait in line for to go though).  The line didn't seem too long (about 3 parties ahead of us) but the place is really small - like diner bar seating only and about 12 seats total.  The wait was about 45 minutes until we finally got seated and we hoped it was worth the wait.  Other people in line were getting antsy and upset about the people sitting there eating and taking their time - dude, chill out!  They probably waited in line just as long as you did if not longer!  Let them enjoy their meal! . . Anywho, our server was really nice and friendly despite working for like 12 hours straight.  We ordered the combo pan roast and the new England clam chowder.  We waited awhile to get our food - you see the chef cooking up each dish in their individual pots and it was kinda cool to see.  They give you ample bread rolls and butter to keep you occupied in the meantime.  The pan roast comes with rice that you mix into it and the clam chowder was delicious on it's own or with bread.  Both were really good and well worth the wait!  The bf said the clam chowder was better than Splash Cafe clam chowder!  Gasp!! haha.  It was one of the best new England clam chowders I've had, and the pan roast was different but really good too!  So glad we got to try this place and you know we'll be back next time we're in town!
Wow combo pan roast was incredible. Line is long but worth the wait. The sourdough bread and butter was a match made in heaven. Menu seems to have changed didn't see calamari as app. They also have $3 dollar draft and wine special after 1am.
I'm addicted. The line is always long and for good reason. There's only 20 seats but it's open 24/7. We ordered the combo pan roast their most popular, shrimp and lobster far diablo, cold seafood combo all was delicious. I ordered shrimp and lobster etouffee to go for my child and it was good but not as good as their pan roast. . . Next time I'll try their cioppiono or bouillabaisse. Oh why not, I'll try both. Lol. . I have been to every oyster bar in the city and all over the U.S., I have to say this is the best I've had. Fresh plump gold seal oysters and clams. Highly recommend this place, worth the wait.
Another very delicious place to eat in Vegas.  Come and try this New Orleans sea food place. You will not be disappointed.  . . Problem: you will wait for 60-90 minutes to be seated.  But is worth the wait.
If I had to choose one dish as my last dish. Its would be the pan roast! This place serves up a mean pan roast, fresh oysters and clams. I haven't had the chance to try everything on there menu. Every time I am in town I always say I will order something different but after waiting in long lines I then realize I came here for the pan roast. I come to vegas about 4 times a year. Which means I get to enjoy pan roast about 8 times a year. Yes, I always try to visit this place twice when I am in town. . . Seating is very limited to 18 seats. They are open for 24 hours. Don't bother sharing because they charge for sharing. This place isn't the best for large groups at its a small dining area.
The BEST clam chowder I've EVER had!! . . This oyster bar is very small and can only seat about 15 people. I arrived there late at night on a weekend (10pm) and got seated at midnight. Waiting for 2 hours wasn't not fun but the food was so delicious that it was worth the wait.
Since I gave review to The Broiler and Ritter's, it's only fair to give a review of the original place The Oyster Bar inside Palace Station Hotel at Las Vegas, NV.  I have to give this place a 5 stars... It's up in Vegas and the food is really exceptional. It's always pack but if you go off normal eating hours, the wait won't be too bad. The staff is friendly but the place is too small. It can't sit that many people because they can't provide the room. So do not go with a big party. That explains why you have to wait.  If you are in Las Vegas this place is a must try.
We waited in line at Palace Station Casino about 30minutes, and then sat at the table waiting for the food for about another 20-30 minutes. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT !!!. This was the best Clam Chowder we ever ate, I HIHGLY recommend the Alaskan Clam Chowder !!!. . It is HUGE. It has clams, jumbo shrimp, lobster(lots of it) and crab. And you can make it spicy on a 1-10 level.... They cook it right in front of you, and they serve it to you at the bar where you will sit and wait for it. . . TRY THIS IF YOU GO TO VEGAS.
Tasty but took me 2 hours waiting in line and 1 hour after order. They might want to hire more people.
After reading the yelp reviews, me and my boyfriend decided to visit the oyster bar on  5/27/14 during our yearly trip to Vegas. Its on the way to and from Trader Joes. I ordered the house gumbo and my boyfriend ordered the Palace Pan roast. We were the only person in line and we waited about 15 minutes. Both of the items were awesome. It was so good we came back on 5/30/14 and wait almost an hour and ordered the same thing. The wait was worth it. Now im still craving the gumbo. Gotta wait another year...
the oyster bar is the greatest thing in the world. . . . no matter how long the wait, you wait for that alaskan clam chowder.
Who knew? Located on the floor of off the Strip casino, this place lacks any sort of the glamour of Vegas. A dozen or so seats around a bar with the food made in front of you. An hour long wait in a line snaking through shoddy slot machines. Even the $1 margaritas nearby aren't worth it.. . But the food is great. The combo pan roast is a must. Thick, filling, creamy and delectable. This could be the best deal in the city.. . The beer selection is good too.
OMG I love this place. The pan roast is just out of this world. The only sucky part is the wait!  BUT....The pan roast is WORTH THE WAIT!   It's sooooo good, they prepare it right in front of you, fresh oysters and clams. They must put crack in that stuff because it always has me wanting to come back for more!  ;-)   Seriously, it's probably one of my favorite foods ever!  I'm not sure how everything else is on the menu. Probably just as good, but the PAN ROAST is the best!!!
I absoluty never ever come to Vegas without coming to get me a bowl of chicken gumbo. Never... The gumbo is soooo delicious and you get sooo much.. . The only part that sucks is there are only about 15 stools to eat and order at. So often times we go, the wait is 1-2 hours standing in line salivating watching everyone eat. Lol. . . But hands down the wait is more than worth it!!. . 4 stars only because of the wait time.
Can't add much here that hasn't already been said.  Authentic fresh seafood, especially the oysters.  A long wait ... Could be 30 min to an hour.  Beloved by locals.  Food is cooked right in front of you.. . If you want a pure no frills seafood feast, this is your place.  A good starter meal would be a bunch of fresh oysters followed by the pan roast of your choice.
I guess I'm biased or maybe I just don't like seafood, but my experience here was just average. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the combo pan roast. My shrimp scampi was just typical but I didn't know it would be so soupy. It really threw me off and it wasn't as flavorful. The pan roast was a lot better but it wasn't something that I would give five stars. It was flavorful but nothing amazing. I arrived at a really good time. We got there around 11:30am and there wasn't much of a line so we were able to order right away. Even though the food was mediocre, the quality of seafood would be a five star rating. They aren't stingy with the seafood and fill up the entrees which is a nice plus as well.
This place is solid!! I've been to many Oyster bars around town and none of them come close to the Palace Stations oyster bar. It's definitely worth the wait. I would highly recommend the combination pan roast if it's your first time. Also, they have the gold band oyster which are really big and always fresh. Be sure to check this place out!
This place has really good food and some of the best oysters I've ever had but the onlyreason I give this place three stars is because the way they prepare the food looks really unsanitary. It's like there isn't any soap here at oyster bar and not too many things get washed or cleaned. You'll probably cringe when you see the dirtiness of the kitchen and the work areas, but if you're able to ignore that, then you'll love this place. . . When ever I'm here, I usually share the Palace Station pan roast and a dozen oysters.
This bar has my favorite oysters. Hands down. I used to dislike oysters, but man this place has changed my mind about them; I've never had oysters so fresh and delicious. ($13). . The palace pan roast ($24)- shrimp, crab, lobster, and andouille sausage (and chicken which they don't mention). I usually get my spice level at around 7/8 and damn is it good. The spice adds a kick which already adds on to the yummy goodness that leaves your stomach extremely happy and satisfied. The clam chowder is also yummy, but it's not as special as their pan roast.. . The only part that is lacking is their service- a bit slow, and you usually have to flag them down to get their attention and it takes forever for the food. But hey, the food speaks louder than their service.
Came to this place three times for this, epic fail... Supposedly you need to wait in line during off business hours! However my motto is to never stand in line to spend your own money lol. Luckily I have a very inquisitive friend who went up to someone and asked to pay for their meal to order take out! We got Pan roast! Still waited 45 min to receive order, lol but in the end it wasawesome milky buttery spicy seafood goodness! Would I stand in line again probably not, but I would bribe someone! Just be ready for a long wait...
The wait is the only bad part.  It's literally a 12-14 person seating area.  The food was really delicious.  Oysters were fresh!  We had about two dozen.  Got the Combo Pan- Roast, and you get to pick your level of spice 1-10 (I chose 6 for a little zing but still not that brave).  The Combo Pan Roast was pretty good with rice but better with the linguini pasta.
First stop when I come to Vegas! Bouillabaisse is incredible! And they'll make it as spicy as you want! The best!
OMG!!!! The combo pan roast!  To die for and simply crave worthy!!!! As a matter of fact. I think I'm gonna get some now!  Definitely worth the wait!
This is traditionally my first stop every time I arrive in Vegas I make the effort to eat out to this place regardless of the wait.  Oysters are big and fresh, and I've tried nearly every item, and love all of them.  Bouillabaisse is not mentioned often but should be tried especially if you love soup or not looking for something rich and hearty.
First... if you don't want to wait in line, I would say go eat elsewhere. But if you're willing to wait, it is beyond worth it. We went a little after midnight on a Saturday thinking there wouldn't be a wait a little later, but we were wrong. Maybe because it was a weekend, who knows. We ended up waiting an hour or so. We ordered the clam steamer appetizer, which was good. My boyfriend ordered the bouillabaisse & I had the combo pan roast. Both were delicious. The pan roast is rich & a little heavy, the bouillabaisse is lighter. It depends what you want, but anything you get will be delicious!
Oyster Bar is bomb!! If you like any sort of seafood or Cajun-style food you MUST try this place out. . . The line's usually long during peak hours (hour+ wait anyone??) but it's worth it! The bar is very small, only 18 seats so you have to wait for everyone to finish before you can get seated and that's why the wait is so long. It's open 24/7 so I would suggest coming at random times - like at 2am - if you want to avoid the line LOL. But keep in mind that you need to be 21+ to sit at the bar! There are no tables or other seating so basically, you have to be 21+ to even eat here. Unless you get to-go.. . FOOD. The fresh raw oysters here are HUGE!! I've never seen oysters that big and they're fresh too! Their pan roasts and gumbo have spiciness levels 1-10. Level 10 will make you sweat balls and it's the only level that includes habaneros. I love spicy foods and level 10 is a bit too much for me. It will definitely set your butthole on fire afterwards, I guarantee that!. . Portions are pretty large too, so I always have leftovers to take home. They actually charge you an extra $5 if you choose to share a bowl with another person, so I would just get your own and then take it to-go later.. . The prices are a bit high for the amount you get, but the food is so delicious you will have no qualms about spending $30 on a bowl of food! My suggestions:. . - shrimp and lobster diablo. - palace pan roast. - fresh oysters. - gumbo. . SERVICE. Dolores is so funny! She's an awesome server and we tipped 20% (even though we are usually stingy with tips) because of her! The staff are all great and wear many hats. The cooks also clean and the servers also prep food just because there are only a couple people working. They are very personable and love talking to their guests!. . OVERALL. Love Oyster Bar! The whole process is quite long - from first standing in line to signing our check, it took 2.5 hours. But the food is sooo worth it!!
Never Again.. I came to Oyster Bar around 1:00AM, with the reasoning: How bad could it be? Coming back from Hakkasan, we were a little tipsy and a lot a bit hungry, so we reasoned that it'd be a great time to try to beat the line and get some Oyster Bar.. . Boy, were we wrong. The line was innocuous enough, only about 6 people ahead of us. Little did we know that at 1:00AM, the bar is basically full of wasted/trashed/smashed patrons who would take hours to finish their food.  With only about a dozen seats available at the bar, it took absoltiutely forever for seats to clear up and parties to be seated, especially if it was a party of 4 or more. . . On top of that, it seemed like the bar was never made to accommodate so many people, and although all the pots were constantly cooking up gumbo or some other delicious dinner, the food itself took about 10-15 minutes to get served after ordering.. . When we finally got seated, the clock read 3:15AM, and only two out of my three companions stayed awake long enough to enjoy the food.. . We got one of everything on the menu, and everything was delicious. I wish I could write more about the quality of the food, but I honestly can't remember much after that wait. Just the taste of food and water finally reaching my mouth, as if I had been lost in the deserts of Nevada for days.. . The food was good, but i honestly can't imagine anything worth such a painful and tiring wait.  . . And for the record, 1AM-5AM are not slow hours for them. I think the secret might be coming in around 6AM-8AM when party goers have finally headed to bed, and no one is willing to get up for breakfast.
Able to get a seat just before lunch time. Wow, service was good and entertaining.  Manhattan clam chowder was great. The linguine with clams in red sauce huge and sssooo good. Couldn't eat the whole bowl. At least another meal. Could have another type of bread, not sourdough. Now I know why the line is always so long for a seat. Go during off hours. It is a 24/7 bar and no kids allowed.
