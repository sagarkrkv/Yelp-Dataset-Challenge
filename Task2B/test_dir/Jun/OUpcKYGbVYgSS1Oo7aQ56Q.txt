We only came to the casino but had a great time playing 21. Our dealer was so helpful and gave advice on what to do. She really made us feel welcome and comfortable since we aren't regular gamblers. If you are going to gamble downtown this is the place to go.
Disappointing all around. I had high hopes given the history of the hotel and many of the reviews I read online. The rooms were decent with the exception of the incredibly noisy air conditioner, but the distance from the hotel lobby to our hotel room was a little annoying especially since the elevators we either not working or way too slow. Just to get down and out to Fremont was a 15 minute ordeal. There are other hotels on Fremont that much easier to navigate. . . The hotel staff were not very welcoming or helpful. I felt as if me checking in was a problem for them. We had issues with our room safe. From all the times we have travelled with room safe issues, we can usually call and then leave if there is nothing in the safe and they will come when they can. However, we did not know this is not the policy at the Nugget. It took almost a full day to get them coordinated enough to replace the battery of our open safe. . . All in all, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here. We gave it a shot for the sake of the pool, but with the lack of chairs available and slow staff service, I wouldn't do it again. If I want to go I will just pay to get in. I will just go back to the hotel I prefer on Fremont.
We stayed here recently and when we got to our room we saw feces on the toilet and throw up on the floor.  They did upgrade us to the gold tower but didn't get much sincerity after that.  Tried contacting their customer service department several times and they have yet to email me back. The one redeeming factor was the pool ...loved the slide and the fish tank. The room was cheap so I probably shouldn't be picky but at least I wanted a clean room to go to. I have pictures but don't worry I won't gross you out and post them
When vacationing in Las Vegas I try to book hotels that make me feel like I'm somewhere else other than at home in the Islands. Places like the California cater so much to the Hawaii visitors that a high percentage of their patrons are from Hawaii. Don't get me wrong....there's absolutely nothing wrong with that...my Mom loves this place... It's just my personal preference and besides I like gambling and meeting family and friends there. The Golden Nugget is where I prefer to stay while in the downtown Las Vegas area.  . . The Golden Nugget offers rooms that are a step up from most hotels in the area and conveniently located a short walk away from the Fremont Street Experience and other hotels.The Shark Tank and pool area is also a plus along with the cleaner and less smokey casino area. The live entertainment near the casino adds to the excitement for the gamblers with hopes of hitting the "Big One". Dining choices here are pretty good and the overall customer awareness above average.. .  Even though the Golden Nugget is nothing like staying at one of the  plush newer hotels on the strip I think it is probably one of the best inexpensive places to stay and get the total Las Vegas experience in the downtown location.
Debating on 3 or 4 stars here but we did really enjoy our stay, a few things though were off putting.. $4 mini water bottle in the hotel room, no thanks.. Also no thanks to the $12 WIFI offered.. Parking that needs to be validated every time you leave or else pay to park, annoying.. Other than that, big, clean rooms, descent bars and dining options, great shark tank pool, good location right on Fremont Street which was a great change from always being on the strip.. Service was so so. . Needed a late check out, they tried to give me a hard time, then gave in.. Needed my two nights stay split up in two bills, again first a hassle, then I got it.. We paid around $50 a night which is a great deal, especially considering the entrance to the pool when not staying at the hotel is $30.. Had a great time here and would have no hesitations coming back again!
We came here over spring break with a $40 per night deal, and got 2 rooms. Yay for inexpensive family vacation.. .  The best thing about Golden Nugget is its shark pool. My kids would have been happy as clams just staying at the hotel and playing there. Unfortunately it was cold and really windy, so windy the pool had to be closed a couple of times.. . The rooms were really nice. You can still catch a whiff of cigarette smoke despite them being smoke-free because, hey, you're in Las Vegas. . . I didn't like how they didn't have many places to eat inside. Two or three restaurants were built but closed and had signs that said something like, "Coming soon (hopefully)." They do have a buffet and they gave us some 50% off coupons. Go early to the breakfast buffets because there's a long line. They also have a Starbucks inside, near the pool. . . I didn't like the location much. Downtown, despite the "Fremont Street Experience," is still pretty gritty. My older kid was covering my younger kid's eyes a lot. There are a lot of street performers or costumed people hanging out and posing for pics, and some were really not trying, like an ate-up looking man in a very dirty (like, actual dirt) drag costume with no make up on. Another was a man in a thong and a cowboy hat. A couple of showgirls were hanging out and they had the most clothes on. Ha. I didn't expect it to be totally sanitized, but the area is still pretty seedy. . . So I'd go if I wasn't planning on leaving the hotel (we only left to find food).
Great hotel, awesome casino, fab room service!  We always book a suite in the gold tower and everything is always wonderful here!  My husband got us a cabana on this months visit and it was the best experience at a pool I ever had, could have been that u have to pay to enter that top level so only a limited amount is allowed and under sixteen not allowed either.  YAY!. Will always love staying here!  Best place to stay downtown.
We decided to give the GN another try and while things were far from perfect there were a lot of positive changes.. . First and foremost check in.  Last year was an awful experience.  This year Jacob was so pleasant, informative and seemingly happy to be dealing with us.  He easily and without pressure sold us an upgraded room, to which we became very appreciative as time went on. An A for Jacob!. . Our room was on the 23rd floor.  Nice view, which we were hoping the upgrade would give us.  The room was as spacious, well decorated and impressive as we remembered it.  It probably isn't as nice, nor as big overall as the rooms at Encore (where we went after our GN stay) but it is the same class all the way! It gets an A!. . The Hotel as well as all of Downtown seem to be improving rapidly!. . One of my big concerns last year was the pool and while . I still have issues it was better.. . It appears they are addressing the raiders from the other hotels downtown by checking keys.  But it still seems they are offering local families incentives or something as the families and couples were everywhere.  Now I didn't check everyone of course, lol.  But I did strike up enough conversations from which I form my opinion.  Further, the big, unsmiling and intimidating bouncer checking the room keys ALWAYS checked my key but I noticed two groups of folks about his age go through  ahead of me with very 'familiar' conversation taking place.  Hmmm.  Also, there is an unguarded door by one of the restaurants that was used quite extensively by folks.. . The pool is still very dirty by the end of the day but is clean by the next morning.  All of than sun tan lotion and in and out to the slide is hopefully the culprit.. . Lastly the adult pool seemed like a bad joke.  They charge 16.00 a chair, needing reservations.  Fair enough.  But the place looked MORE crowded than the regular pool, lol!  The only difference was the lack of kids.  Seems like a better idea to make it more exclusive even if that means charging more.. . In closing, the staff still has it's share of grumpy Gus's - the attendant at the spa who didn't even care a little about discussing massage options for my wife with me and he even argued with me aggressively about some meaningless point (???) -but there were more than a few really pleasant staff members (like Jacob) and that attitude goes a long way.  I hope the Nugget continue the trend.
It was my first time staying downtown, and I was very happy with the place. If you are going to stay downtown , this is the only place to stay out. It seemed so much cleaner and classy then the other Fremont street casinos. The food at claim jumpers was good, and the dealers are all very nice. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy.
Great Hotel, Great staff, great location..... . This hotel is everything I was looking for in Vegas. The fact that you don't have to walk 4 miles to go from your hotel to the restaurants and then to the pool was the best part. Valet is FREE, the wi-fi not being free is not an issue as my phone has free Wi-fi anyway.  The price of drinks and food will more spendy than back home, WAY cheaper than any other Vegas hotel. . .   The pool OMG was to die for, the kids had a blast, and yes.. there was a lot of kids but guess what adults.. You have two upper decks with your own pool areas.. So why are you complaining about too many kids in the pool?  I was able to get up by 7am to throw a towel down on some chairs to reserve them for later, but I felt bad for the people that walked around forever looking for an empty chair. The pool was over-crowded people were sitting on the ground....I saw like 4 fights about people reserving chairs with old towels.. I say, quit whining, get up early and do the same thing :) . .  My kids and I had a BLAST, great hotel, great clean comfy, quiet room, all in all we visit Vegas like 5 times a year.... We will be back!!. . Finally, Fremont Street is amazing and WAY more fun than the strip! Free concerts, street performers, etc.... We will never stay on the strip again!!
This was our third stacation and we decided to stay in Freemont this time. We chose Golden Nugget for the pool. The pool it self was small, but it does have the tank in the middle of it. It's nearly impossible to find a chair during the day, never mind needing two in a row for your family. . . We stayed in the golden tower. The room was ok. It had a musky smell in it. More than likely it use to be a smoking room but isn't any more. The beds weren't the best.  The a/c barely kept the room at a desirable temperature. The bathroom was your standard hotel bathroom. It was clean and had granite counter tops. The room did have a nice big flat screen tv, but not a lot of channels offered. It was a good stay, but we probably wouldn't stay here again.
Love all the renovations they did. Best hotel in downtown. Rooms are a little on the old side and very simple, no luxury here.. . They have two pools that are amazing. Beautiful shark tank right inside the downstairs pool. Tons of pool lounge chairs and fresh beach towels available. There's one hidden away upstairs that stays open until 2 or 3 am, which is later than most other pools at other hotels. . . Food - sushi at the smaller sushi restaurant was not good...something you could get premade at 7-11. Lobster Bisque at the Grotto gets a 5 star rating. Vic & Anthony's pretty good depending on what you order.. . This is for the ballers on a budget who don't mind staying off the strip.
Nice renovation to an old hotel. Good rates on room. We rented a cabana at the pool & were way over charged but it was an okay overall experience
I have stayed at the Nugget several times over the past several years as I like the Fremont experience over the Strip. The service over my stays have always been inconsistent. Over Memorial Day weekend 2013, I payed an enormous amount for a Spa Tower Pool View suite. It wasn't ready for check-in when I arrived, which was fine as they told me they would call when it was ready. They hadn't called by 5:00pm, so when I returned to the VIP check-in, the manager rudely told me that there were no guarantees on check-in times, and they would call me when the room was ready. I finally got to check-in after 6:15pm. I wrote off that experience due to the busy Memorial Day weekend. However, after my last visit on 6/13/2014, I think I'll to stay elsewhere. I booked a Gold Tower suite and it was a slower weekend, so check-in was no problem and the room seemed fine. I was only staying one night for a quickie trip, as I often do. But when I got up to get ready for my early flight, I was covered with bed bug bites. I had no time to contact management due to my 9am flight, but based on past reviews, I doubt it would have mattered.
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!. I do not care if it is in downtown Las Vegas. I loved the Golden Nugget!. Where to start!, we'll they have such a beautiful chandelier in the lobby, the valet is so nice, I stayed in the newest towers in the VIP they have treats and water each time you get out the elevator the rooms were so perfect they had free wifi they have such a nice Shark Tank it is so fun, it's not only just for kids but for adults. The casino was very nice they have a bar and they have the est chicken wings ever! I loved the room service I loved this hotel so much. You will too
Not enough security in the gold diggers club. We were attacked by a large gay african american and a small gay hispanic. Security did nothing. I do not recommend going to this establishment.
The very best hotel downtown and the best pool in vegas that's the good. The bad is you can tell the attitude of the employees comes from the top management.  They simply don't care if you have a problem I have been staying there for years but will not come back. They act like they are doing you a favor by you staying there and if you have a problem they do there best to show phoney concern then do nothing I emailed them after one particular stay in which I dealt with several rude employees and the never even answered so long nugget
The Good. . They have a Claim Jumper's in the hotel with normal Claim Jumper's prices and for $5 you can get room service from anything off the Claim Jumper's menu.. . It cost me a $133 a night which was a good deal for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival.. . They let me check out at 5pm for $28.. . They have a self-serv kiosk for checkin with no lines.. . The Bad. . Even though I put the privacy door tag, I was repeatedly bothered by the house-cleaning staff.  Please educate them that privacy means do not disturb.. . Also, the power outlets are inconveniently located.  I had to move my mattress to charge my cell phone.  I was in Carson Tower 383.. . The Windows are really thin so you year all the outside noise like car alarms and people honking their horns outof frustration for not being able to find a parking space in the structure whose capacity can't handle the capacity of the hotel.. . When the lot is full, you have to pay $5 to park at the Plaza hotel a block away.. . Results. . I docked them 1 star for the constant interruptions by staff.  I was at an all-night music festival so the last thing I wanted was to be interrupted multiple times while trying to sleep and having a privacy sign on the door.. . I docked them half a star for the power outlets and another half a star for the parking situation.
Great show: Gordie Brown. !!!! 6 plus times we have seen his show.  Buffet is excellent. ..a few dollars more includes show tickets.
The property itself is a star here thanks to Steve Wynn and investments since. It would rate a 4. Unfortunately the management and staff are a zero, so on this scale they are a 1.  The owners are a mediocre restaurant chain that specialized  in highly marketed properties with huge volume and crappy product to the masses. They run their GN hotels with exactly the same philosophy. They DO NOT know quality, nor how to run a hotel AT all. Lobby?  Filled with a line of people waiting forever to checkin. Why?  Poorly trained staff, barely at a minimum. Don't want to wait 2 hours to check in, then u could pay their $35 VIP! Can u spell ripoff. The staff is right out of Dick's Last Resort, obnoxious, mean, wishing they were not there. I would say this was a staff training failure, but clearly they are not trained, beyond giving them a manual.  Example, just one out of many, upon checkout (another long line in crowded lobby) the valet watched as I loaded bags into car. When my wife asked whether they no longer do that FOR guests his answer was epic: "only when asked." That is the GN experience in a nutshell. Horrible attitude, minimal staffing, no management who knows better. Do not expect much, and you will not be disappointed.
If I can give less thsm one star I would. Bags were lost and bell hop took forever to put our bags in our car. Hotel gave me the runaround. Almost missed my flight.
