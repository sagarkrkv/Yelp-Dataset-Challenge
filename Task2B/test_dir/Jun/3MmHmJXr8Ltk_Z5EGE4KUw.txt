We visit Vegas several times a year and love the different restaurants available. This time it was Carnevino. We had reservations at 700 but arrived earlier. No problem. We were taken right in. We were brought a nice ciabatta role with lardo butter and whipped butter which was delicious. Grilled octopus, great. The problem was with the entrees. I had read about their way of cooking steak, but didn't believe it. I should have. The very expensive strip steak came out mooing. We ate half of it and the area by the bone was really raw. We made the waiter aware just to tell the chef. We weren't looking for anything. The steak was taken off the bill.  Very surprised. Excellent service. Food mediocre
We have wanted to try Carnevino for years, but always went to our tried and true favorites in Las Vegas.  On our last night in town yesterday, we found ourselves in the Palazzo and decided to get some pasta at the bar before shopping.  What a wonderful experience!  The bar staff and manager could not have been more friendly or attentive and we felt at home enjoying some of the most delicious ravioli we've ever tasted (we had the beef cheek special and it was amazing). We were also treated to complimentary fried cheese, delicious rosemary bread with savory duck fat spread, and very generous wine pours.  Carnevino will now be one of the places we always go when visiting Las Vegas.
The music played in the restaurant was like listening to a heavy metal band.  It was.  too loud. The speakers are on the wall above your table.  You cannot carry on a conversation with others at your table withoutshouting.  Even after mentioning the loud music to the server they turned it down one decibel. . The service was attentive.  The food was good but for the price I had higher expectations. One person wore a bathing suit and T shirt.  Too many baseball caps, backwards of course.  Too pricey for the atmosphere and ambience..

Very good steak house that actually earned its fifth star on pasta.  I have been to many steak houses and it is very hard to differentiate but Carnevino did a good job.. . The highlight of the meal was ravioli stuffed with beef cheeks, a special of the day and I believe a Battali specialty.  They were great, and the balsamic drizzled on it made the dish.. . For an entree shared a porterhouse for two.  Luckily, the waiter and other Yelpers warned how they cook on the rare side and people are not exaggerating.  I hate over cooked steak but we ordered it medium and ended up with rare or rare +, which was perfect but anything less would not have been.  The strength of the steak was the aging, and you could definitely taste the age flavor (and that is a good thing).  Also had fried eggplant as a side, and that was great.. . For dessert, had a very good pistachio cannoli.  It was actually two large cannolis and I would have been happy with one.  . . The steak and ravioli earned that fifth star in a competitive steak field.
You must try the 240 day aged ribeye steak. It's def one of the best steaks I've ever had. It has an ultra beefy blue cheese "ness" that's rich and amazing. You have to order by the inch but one inch is a large portion. They serve the steaks tomahawk style on the bone leaving the short rib on and suggest picking up the bone for that cave man indulgence. They carve the beef table side and medium rare on the rare side. The beef cheeks ravioli was crazy bomb too. A must pasta course...The service here is immaculate too. Hats off to Mario Batali and team.
I'm a vegetarian, and I love this place.  Excellent wine selection!  Service is second to none.  Been there many times.
One of the most amazing steakhouses I have ever been to. The filet Mignon and the aged ribeye were incredible. It's every bit worth the price.
Okay, negative reviews solely based on price are not fair! Food and Service don't get much better on the Strip.... From lardo butter, to grilled octopus, to the massive porterhouse steak to the citrus chocolate dessert. Everything I ate and drank was worth the large bill.. . I'm in Vegas usually once or twice every 3-6 months and I have eaten EVERYWHERE.  Thanks to the tourist destination, the celebrity chefs and bright lights most the restaurants on the Strip will be overpriced and/or expensive.  In my eyes,  overpriced means the meal was not worth what was charged.  Expensive means the meal was in fact, expensive but good!. . Our party of 4 spent around $500, included bottle of wine, cocktails, appetizers, steak (the porterhouse is large enough for four to share), dessert and after dinner cappuccinos.  We all were so happy with bellies filled with awesomeness, the bill was a mere afterthought (it helps if you rock the craps table before you go in !). . The atmosphere is cocktail meets rock 'n'roll. Its loud and weird and personally, I would eat here regularly if it was in my budget!
I loved this place. I'm a huge Batali fan and was worried if his restaurant would hold up in Vegas as often those of celebrity chefs do not. (See my review on Alain Ducasse's Mix) and I was not disappointed. The food was fantastic. Wine parings delicious. I had the pasta with lamb ragu and it was amazing. Everyone else had either meat or pork and they loved it. I would absolutely return.
I almost never leave reviews, but feel compelled to do so here in order to communicate just how impressed I was with the professionalism of the Carnevino staff yesterday evening.  My wife and I had tried to dine at another Strip restaurant, but left after the hostess treated us rudely and with an extreme lack of class.  Even though we arrived at Carnevino at 11:05 p.m., well after the final dinner seating, the manager on duty graciously allowed us to sit in the main dining room, where one other group was still dining.  We have eaten at many other Batali restaurants, both here and in New York, and the food is almost always stellar.  This meal was no exception.  We started off with two sides -- mushrooms and fregola/corn -- as appetizers.  Both were healthy portions (close to family style in size), and both were well executed.  For mains, we shared the (1) spago pasta with lamb ragu and (2) tagliatelle with vegetable ragu.  As to the latter, the ragu typically accompanies the gnocchi, but the chef agreed to accommodate my request to sub in tagliatelle.  At the "other restaurant" (which shall remain nameless), we had been instructed to order quickly because it was late and the kitchen wanted to close (even though the dining room was still full of people ordering food).  At Carnevino, by contrast, they attended to us as if we were VIPs, despite the late hour.  All in all, the food was great once again.  But on this night, it was the superb service that salvaged what otherwise would have been a horrible night.
Real nothing special. Waiter mislead us on several items. Real quite disappointing. Ate in under 40 minutes and left
This was truly one of the absolute best dining experiences we have ever had. The service was incredible,  the food so delicious and the atmosphere was wonderful.  The porterhouse bone in cut was possibly the most flavorful steak we ever had. I highly recommend it!
The Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye was outstanding.
Really really great! I believethe pasta i had for lunch was called 'Spago' OMG so good, not an overwhelming portion either, it was just enough for me and the salad I had was delicious as well.
This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  It is a bit overpriced, but the food is to die for!  I think they have the best steaks in town.  The Rosemary Bread with churned butter and lardo are a great starter.  You will not find better service anywhere.  I try to go about once a month and the staff all knows who I am.  Last time I even had a bad experience with the steak not cooked right, and the manager made it right.  Also, don't forget to have dessert.  I'm not a "sweets" eater, but I never pass on it there.  It is out of this world!  The freshness of the ingredients really shows, as well.
We had planned to have dinner here during a recent trip to Vegas and were quite excited to dine at a Batali restaurant and, in particular, try the riserva steak.  At the time we made the reservation we asked if the riserva would be available (it was a couple of weeks ahead of time) and they said they couldn't say we had to ask that day.  Our reservation day arrived and I called again to find out whether they had the riserva available.  They said they couldn't tell me until we actually showed up.  I explained to the woman on the phone that we planned to eat at CV specifically for the riserva and might have to dine elsewhere.  She said there was nothing she could do.  So we cancelled the reservation and had an absolutely outstanding meal at Nobu.
