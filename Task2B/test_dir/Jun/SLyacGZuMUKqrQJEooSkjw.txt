It doesnt have the glitz and glamour like the other buffets in Vegas. But it does the trick. Lots of good food. Lots of variety.
Some of the food was cold, waiters took long to fill up water, but overall it was pretty good. Dessert section was delish and cant forget about BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS ;)
My husband and I were given free meals to eat here before our show at the V-Theater at the Planet Hollywood.. So why not use it, right???. . FREE BUFFET!!! yay!!!. . Dude.. but we just had a sandwich from Earl's like.... an hour and a half ago.... . So we dove right in and ate as much crab legs as we wished.. . I like how they're half cracked already.. so it's semi effortless to just get the crab meat and dunk it in butter.. . The salad bar--if you're into it does not have a lot of 'toppings'.. however i did like the tomato salad for some reason because of huge mozza balls.. . (I honestly was just too overwhelmed with all our meals; all i wanted was a salad at that time... and i couldn't pass on crabs of course)..... . They have a nice array of dessert that my husband enjoyed. He particularly liked the bread pudding.. . Service was excellent; but I wasn't wow'd much with the selection.
Overall pretty good experience. The line was long, but they moved through it fairly quickly. Waitress was extremely nice and on point. I tried a bit of everything and everything was pretty good the best section by far is the Middle Eastern.. Eat the lamb kabobs and baba.
Best dinner buffet in Las Vegas (in my opinion). Maybe other viewers didn't make the right food choices?
The buffets at the casinos in Oregon have spoiled me. All of the food at Spice Market was either bland or blatantly over-salted. Puhlease. The seafood was a joke.
Lots of choices. Desserts were awesome. Service was great. Very delicious and good selection of food, beer and wine. Loved their Mac n cheese... Fish n chips....very delicious little bucket of fried chicken n biscuit.... California rolls....awesome pork sausage fried rice, pork carnitas tacos ( skip the guacamole....its awful) And did I mention the deserts? : ) They also have a huge selection of cheese, olives and yummy breads, which are set up nicely and all look very delicious. Breads are really good n fresh.. One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. Must try!
What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concerned
The food was good with a decent selection, not amazing. The atmosphere isn't anything special. It's not lively, especially for Vegas. Went with a groupon, so it was a good price. Otherwise it is overpriced
I kind of don't understand the negative reviews if you compare it with "the buffetts on the strip". Now I have not tried the Caesar palace buffets which seems to be a good one. But I have tried a handful abd this one seems to be pretty good. I give it a four and not a five because I specifically wanted the tandoori chicken skewers and was there for dinner yet they only had lamb. It would help to remove the sign as well.. . Food selection is versatile and very satisfying. They have two different salad bars which include healthy choices and a good variety. Entire seafoid bar. The middle eastern food was very well executed and the variety was so fresh. The Mexican food was fresh and the chicken fajitas were so tasty. Their breads on both sides of the restaurant are so delicious.. . OMG THE DESSERT!!! Crepes made to order. Fabulous creme brule, and a variety of cupcakes that is so overwhelming. Cotton candy, ice cream, other tours if cakes, cobbler, bread pudding. If you want to try one buffet this should be it.
This is an excellent buffet for the price. Do not buy the groupon as you can get a cheaper deal from the tickets tonight booth (50% off!). The unlimited drinks option is not worth it as the service is very slow so you will only get 1 refill. . . The line is very long and moves extremely slowly. Try to go around 6pm as the wait is much longer around 7pm or 8pm. They say Monday is one of their busiest days. I think it is well worth the wait though, because the stations have so many options. The crab, fish and chips, american station, Mediterranean and dessert station were the highlights for me. . . Overall, this buffet is great value and the food is pretty decent. The fish and chips, crab and dessert station are really good! I'd spend most of your time there :)
Out of the 3 buffets we ate at from our Buffet of Buffets tour while in Vegas, this was the best one out of the three.. . The variety they has wasn't bad and I especially liked the prime rib the most since it was served medium rare and wasn't tough or chewy like the one at Paris buffet. The crab legs were also good and I was only able to eat a few since I was so tired of eating the same foods after three buffets.. . The interesting new items I tried were the country fried chicken in little small baskets which was tasteless and very bland. It was moist and juicy, but lacked any flavor. I also was able to try the fish and chips also served in small baskets and it also lacked any real flavor. It seriously needed some tarter sauce to help give it some taste.. . The dessert area looked great with the many different kinds of cupcakes they had with multiple flavors to choose from. Too bad I wasn't able to sample any, but I did have the vanilla ice cream and it was just terrific. I'm not sure how they make it from custard cream, but it makes a big difference from your standard ice cream. It was very smooth and creamy like. My gf had the cotton candy from here and it was a nice big size plus I was surprised she was able to finish it after her meal. . . Good buffet option for me to come here again the next time in Vegas and to come here first on my next tour of buffet of buffets.
I am extremely unsatisfied with the purchase I made for Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood.. I got in about 9:45 pm. My friend went to go find parking and I waited in short, yet slow line to go in. After waiting in line I showed them my Groupon they said I had to pay the tax on it. It was about 4 dollars, but I didn't have it on me since I didn't expect to pay anything additional. Usually if there is any additional fees the Groupon would state it, I already talked to them about this. FYI prepare to pay the taxes on your Groupon there. . I guess my fault for not having extra on me and leaving it in the car. Anyway, back to the buffet. . The buffet closes at 11pm. I finally went around and saw the trays were empty and the food was cold. Just like everyone has been saying...the crab legs are cold and the butter looks like lard. The employees are more occupied with cleaning, rather than making sure the trays are warm. Cold food=not happy.. I was looking forward to dessert since the food selection was bare and cold, and on the site it says that they have a Crepe station. I didn't see anyone at the station. After I had other dessert and was full, I saw the lady working the crepe station come back. Too late! . To make matters worst, it was our last night in Las Vegas and we were supposed to go clubbing. Two of the friends felt too sick after the buffet and we didn't end up going :(. The only thing I loved about this was that our waitress never once hesitated to refill our drinks and let us know all the selection that was available.. While there I saw some girls flirting with the manager. They were given "to-go boxes." Two of them flirted and laughed with he manager as the other one filled boxes with desserts. I thought it was funny so I snapped some pictures. I don't want anyone to get in trouble, so I won't post. I asked the lady at one of the stations if I could take my cupcake and she said no food is allowed outside. Just a FYI- If you are with your girls I guess you might want to try your luck!
It was an okay buffet since it offered a lot of options. Don't expect fancy food though. Our server was nice but unfortunately, he had a big area so took a little long to get our drinks.
6 of usbought the groupon for $46 per couple for ayce & all you can drink. We arrived around 9:30pm & made line which was just dreadful. We probably had to stand in line for about 45min before finally getting to the registers, only to find out we still had to pay taxes ($11ish for 6 ppl) not that bad but give us the heads up ppl! . The food was just meeeeh!!!! Im assuming it was because it was the end of the night. They do close at 11pm but we left a bit after midnight. Yes, we were the rowdy Mexicans who wouldn't leave because we wanted to keep on drinking ;) But thats because we didn't like the food so we opted to just drink! 3 stars for the great service from the waiter & the wine and beer. -2 stars for the food. . . I wouldn't go out of my way to pay full price for this place!
The food was ok...the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the dessert was amazing!!! The cupcakes were so moist, loved the all the mini tarts and the tiny strawberry shortcake was so pretty and was delicious.
This was our last buffet before our "Buffet of Buffets" pass expired. . . We arrived around 4pm. After getting the green light from the cashiers we waited in a line to be seated. We waited for about 10 mins, which we thought was quite long because there were open tables available! We also did not get much service from our server. Nevertheless, we were eventually seated and ready to explore the buffet.. . Spice Market Buffet had an excellent variety of food to choose from. They rival even Rio's! I really liked their lamb kabobs and pesto pasta. The asian selection was also great and they had jasmine rice in mini togo boxes which was "cute" remarked my cousin. . . This buffet had delicious food but their slow service was disappointing. I would visit again, depending on the price.. . My ranking of buffets. 1. Le Village Buffet (Paris). 2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio). 3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood). 4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's). . Didn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full!
The best part with this buffet is that they have the Mediterranean section.. . I tried a little bit of everything in my first plate and the second plate was all Mediterranean. It was that good.. . This is a note to myself - if I have a chance to come back to Spice Market Buffet, I should get Mediterranean again.
