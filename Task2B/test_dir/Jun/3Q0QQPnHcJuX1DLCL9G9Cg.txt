Great spot for a layover. I got a awesome breakfast sandwich at the bagel place had my favorite coffee from Starbucks and didn't have a hard time finding a seat while I waited.. . Although the charging stations weren't functional they had more being added to recharge the electronics.
Shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think. It is always busy here and the most popular airline is US Airways so I am not sure how I feel about that. The aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane. The cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel. . . When I landed here initially I got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that I had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate. Definitely a first. Other than that I enjoyed my time at the aiport. . . The one thing that I did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely RUDE. I am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town, but every person I had to talk to seemed like they hated everyone. Really irriated me and I hated being there. I am not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town. Blew my mind away, but than again I will never get  people. I am from Chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here.
Dear Charlotte Airport:. Why don't you pay your restroom attendants enough money so that they don't have to beg for tips? After spending money for the flight, an extra $25 for checking a bag, $4.49 for a teeny bag of nuts, and $8.50 for a $5 salad, I just don't FEEL like tipping to use a[n admittedly clean] public restroom. Pay these people decent wages.. Also, why do people have to sit on the FLOOR to use the electrical outlets? You lose three stars for these things. You get one back for your superior recycling system.. Your pal,. Amanda. p.s. I think you may have fleas.
Be patient.  It's a nice airport but it does get chaotic.  Scheduling seems to be random and gates get really busy with flights leaving right next to or across from one another.
Easy to navigate.
I love to travel so I am always excited to see the airport, unless I am waiting in the cell phone lot. The airport is clean and efficient. Never had any issues here. Depending on the day it can be a bit busy but that is the case with all airports I suppose.
Fairly easy to navigate. They like to route people into different Long Term parking lots throughout the week. It is important to keep your parking ticket with you. Why, you ask? In the event you suffer from amnesia like I did and forgot where you parked. I thought I knew where I parked and got dropped off with my luggage in one of the long term lots. Wandering around, I obviously looked lost and thank goodness another shuttle bus came by and a Good Samaritan asked if I needed help. I got onto that bus who drove me around until I actually found my car. I That's Southern Hospitality!. Separately I love the fact they have a Jamba  Juice since it was always hard for me to find a good smoothie in SC. And the rocking chairs in the central food court are great for passing the time.
Just flew in here from Lisbon, Portugal. Any lay over at this point is a drag. Having said thAt the customs here is totally automated, which is a big plus. The dining & drinking options seem to be plentiful. Good airport & easy to get in or out.
Beautiful layout to this airport, I  didn't know it it looks so well, i'm really impressed with all the food choices and lounges to have a drink and how courteous the people are. I would like to see a little more transportation inside to move the people along more rapidly because of the volume of traffic that's at the airport on a daily basis.
Just like many of the large airports, this one is similar with tons of restaurants, shops and charging stations. Since it is a bigger airport, be prepared for the crowds. However, they do have many places to eat for vegetarians.. . There is a farmer's table or something like that here. However, it was all meals with meat in it. I think it was like $2 for a single banana too. I just opted for some overpriced and overcooked pizza. It did the job until I was ready to hop on the next flight back home. . . If I had a long layover, I would not mind being stuck here with all that this airport has to offer.
Very charming and comfortable airport. Several good restaurants. Unfortunately it's home to a most unreliable airline.
I hate airports.  They are like jails.  Except you have to be arrested to get thrown out. . . Charlotte Douglas is better than most.  There are rocking chairs, with accessible outlets near.  Lots of food choice, including vegetarian.  That is a nice change from the other airports.
Poor food quality. Ordered the burrito which was not rolled correctly so it fell apart almost as soon as I started to eat it. The guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency. The food was fast though, which is really about all you can expect from an airport restaurant.
The rest room attendants greet you and ensure that you pick up on their large "tip" jars placed by the hand basins - a nice little earner, but one I'm not used to seeing so much in other airports.. A large unpleasant security girl confiscated my security sealed bottle of gin, without an explanation apart from saying "it ain't right" - remarkable since it was purchased in Manchester airport, sealed in a security bag there, and totally intact. Maybe that's another staff perk?. Rocking chairs a free Wi-Fi are good touches and lots of choices to eat at.
This airport was one of my layovers from Puerto and I loved it. The gate signs were well lit and it was hard to get lost. The different concourse were always easy to navigate to. Theu had rocking chairs in some of the common waiting areas and I thought that was so cool. There was a lot of food places on the US airways terminal which was awesome because I was starving. They have some cool decore, like a large airplane hanging from the ceiling. I took away one star because the restrooms don't have seat covers, yuck!
Not bad as far as airports go. No smoking lounges (probably for the better considering the poor ventilation that's popular among airports). No fun rides between terminals (by "rides" of course I mean intraairport modes of transportation). One thing's for certain:  If you have a layover here, your arriving and departing flights can't be more than 200 yards apart!. . [I can say these things...I'm from CLT!]
Love this airport!  Always a helping hand and the restaurants are 4 star!  Cannot believe that they invested in great dining here but I am all for it.  Not sure about the reviewer that says it is chaos--are real International Airports are.  The great thing about this place is that Southern Hospitality abounds.  I am all for that and it is a good thing.  I have made this airport my home airport because I am a 100% road warrior traveler.  Yes, try CLT.
On my way back from a memorable trip down Souff...I get to enjoy Charlotte Int'l for a bit. . Many restaurants (both local and national), shops, kiosks, etc and other spots to drain a few extra bucks out of you while you're 'trapped' here.. . I do like the old school rocking chairs throughout the concourses. I like the charging stations everywhere as all the major airports have. I like the filtered  water refilling stations throughout. the airport as well.   I would LOVE a lil POS kiosk with some booze in it as well, so we can deal with the chatty passengers/seat kicking kids/loud talking mofo's that every flight seems to have.. . Overall a great layout, long walks to connecting flights, comfy chairs, nice and helpful employees.  Can't ask for much more.   Thumbs up
yeah, its an airport
I've been in and out of this airport alot lately.   I decided to write a review after passing through today on another international USAirways flight.   I love their customs and immigration,  the baggage drop for those passengers connecting to a domestic flight and the fact that the international flight's exit is in very close proximity to the security check points!  Talk about convenient.  They have electronic kiosks in which you fill in your customs card and the kiosk prints it out for you.   The kiosk scans your passport and you have to hold still for a quick picture.   I was through customs in less than 20 mins and that includes waiting for my checked bag.   . . I also get my Bojangles fix when passing through here.   But let's keep that between us.   I don't want my trainer to find out.
I showed up at this airport late on a Friday night after lots of travel delays and cancellations-- so I was not in the greatest mood. But every single person that worked at the airport that I interacted with was incredibly kind and thoughtful. They were so wonderful that it made me want to move to NC. Charlotte airport is incredibly lucky to have such amazing employees.
This was was a very clean airport.  I was surprised.   They have a friendly gentleman in the restroom to guide weary male travelers to open urinals.   Quite a courteous fellow,  which is hard to find in any location,  let alone an airport bathroom.   The airport itself was well equipped for my layover.   It had overpriced pizza, bathrooms,  and seats.   Our flight was delayed because the crew was running late from their previous flights, but the gate staff was very good about updating and keeping people from losing their shit.  Good place for a layover!
This airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now. they need to get this fix quickly. apparently they are rebuilding new parking decks so in order to park you have to park at the lots across some street and get on a suttle in order to get  back to the airport. so terrible if you are not just picking up and dropping off your friends and family.
layover to change planes - pleasant new terminal - lots of upscale looking shops and restaurants - clean bathrooms - clean common areas - no outside noise. good for a break.
Growth in process!  A plus for the Queen City opening the doors to International Travel!
