excellent customer service...!! fried chicken was the best in vegas.. seriously.. crab legs were small but hey can you pile em up unlimited..!!! desert bar wasn't that great.. locals get a discount..will definitely return.
Insane seafood buffet. Oysters and crabs overload. Copious amounts. If seafood is your thing, this is your place.
I visited a day ago for the weekend. The price was not worth the food, weekend price was 35+ but the food was basic and not even of the freshest quality.. . The weekday prices reflects the food that was served on the weekend.. . Overall, it's a little disappointing. . . Service was great though
CHAMPAGENE BRUNCH! Need I say more? I could not believe they were only charging 30 dollars for champagne brunch. I don't know how many mimosas I drank but I can tell you I left feeling elated. This buffet is not super fancy smanshy like the Bellagio BUT the food is good and the service is excellent. The divided the buffet into regions American food, Asian food, etc. I ate so many crab legs dipped in melted butter. Think about it right now is making me hungry. I  completely forgot my waitresses name but she was SWEETHEART we fell in love with her. She constantly checked up on us and made sure our glasses were full, table was cleared, and we had enough napkins. She definitely exceeded my expectation in regards to customer service at buffet. Her name tag said Manila she was from the Philippines.
If you like lot's of choices and to so much food that your stomach may explode then head to the Rio Buffet.  Enormous food stations with different kinds of food from all over the world.  From the typical fast food to more refined dishes can be found at this buffet.  After stuffing yourself with large amounts of food you can start over again at the dessert buffets.  . . Like most buffets is Las Vegas it's a affordable way to eat a  lot but if you want to discover new things or more exquisite tastes you have to look somewhere else (and pay more). . Not suitable for people who are on a diet :)
They do carry a large selection of food and deserts. Have to pay extra for the full bar. I loved their sushi and cheesecake selection. Couldn't really tell difference between ice-cream and gelato....which everyone was going crazy over. Went to get desert and when I got back, my drinks were gone and table wiped clean :( guess they were eagerto kick people out.. The buffet is huge but less main course food and more side dishes like different types of corn,potatoes ( mash,fries,baked, etc), salad, different kind of rolls and so on. Nothing big n special like you will find in the strip buffets.
You can't possibly overcook a prime rib more than this place. What is the word used to describe 3 phases beyond "well-done"?. . Person after person would come up to the carving section, see how over cooked the prime rib was and just walk away and the guy at the station pretty much was left with nothing to do and seemed kind of embarrassed, "uh yea, this is all we have".. . Not only is it a disappointment for all the paying guests who come to dine wanting some prime rib, but it's a waste of food.. . I should post a video of the amount of people who walk up to the station and then take a look at the meat and walk away. . . You guys seriously need to take a look at what you are doing to your prime rib. The guy had 3 full prime ribs up there and each one looked like it had been stuck in a dehydrator for 3 days.. . This is not the first time I visited and the prime rib was napalmed. Hopefully this review will get someone on the inside to investigate the destruction of food.
Much variety!   As long as a football field!  It was good food. Very friendly service.  Good price for the selection. Rolls weren't fresh. Big negative for me.  At least six different types of breads and not a one was fresh.  Our picture was taken at the entrance but I have no idea where we were supposed to look at them. Glad I tried it.
Wow this buffet was pretty awesome! Huge food selection - I thought it went on forever when I was getting my food. The food was also pretty delicious and best of all dinner was only 27 bucks! Cheaper than most buffets and also have better food than the buffets that cost almost the same price. . . I could almost say it's almost as good as Bacchanal in Caesars Palace but for a cheaper price. . . The service was also very wonderful - our waitress was so sweet and she was quick at clearing the plates and bringing us refills. . . Overall I was glad we tried this buffet - I would recommend it as one of the buffets to try out while in Vegas.
This buffet is the best of the best. I have been coming here for years with my family and it beer seem to disappoint us.. . The lines are crazy but very worth it.. . The food is very good you will not regret it.
This buffet is a hidden gem in vegas. I had the 24 buffet pass and had been to paris and the "oh so special" Caesar buffet, and this place tops Caesars. Sure the juice isn't served in fancy little glasses and the food isn't plated in the cutest of ways, but when it comes down to buffets, I just want a wholesome quality buffet to satisfy my cravings. Rio definitely has more selection than most buffets and their Gelato bar is freaking awesome. Overall, quality and selection is spot on, however the atmosphere isa bit like that of hometown buffet; but, hey, then again we are talking about Rio.
Huge variety, the wait was a bit wait to sit down, felt like I was at Disneyland, but hey, it was Sunday Brunch.
This buffet is huge!! Lol Just went this past weekend and we got to use the groupon coupon which is 50 bucks for two people and two free bottles of wine! We wanted mimosas and so we ordered orange juice and the super sweet bartender let us have champagne instead of wine! We didn't finish one and got ti take it back to the room for the next morning!

Well, I have to say this is THE biggest buffet I have ever seen.  Yes, it is a buffet, but the most amazing and largest buffet you probably have ever seen.  It spreads from wall to wall in a huge room.  A football field long?  Maybe.  Close.  If you can't find something or numerous things you like here, you won't anywhere else.  With buffets you don't necessarily expect the service to be great, but service absolutely was great - from entering throughout our whole meal.  Michael Lee was so friendly and attentive.  He went out of his way to make a great experience for us.  Roberto refilled our drinks at just the right time and changed out plates like he knew when to be there.  Great fresh food, great service.  Get the crab til you drop!  Highly recommended!  I will be back.....
I went here with my cousin and brother for our first buffet with the "Buffets of Buffets" pass. We arrived around 4:30 pm and there was no line at all!. . Our waitress was really nice and delivered excellent customer service. She checked up on us a lot and would ask if we needed any refills. She also brought my brother a mini lobster cracker for his crabs!. . This buffet was huge and had a wide variety of foods to choose from. The food was decent, the variety really makes up for the quality. And while the sushi was pretty average, the rest of the Asian section was yummy! For dessert, we had the gelato which was delicious! . . Overall, our experience was great and Carnival World Buffet would definitely be one of the Buffets I would return to!. . My ranking of the buffets. 1. Le Village Buffet (Paris). 2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio). 3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood). 4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's). . Didn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full from all the food!
One of the better buffets that we have been to. A huge selection and just about every type of food that you can imagine. The service was great and there was a nice selection of sugar-free desserts to choose from. The price is reasonable as was the wait time to get in.
I've been coming here for years and I believe the quality has been going down lately.  We never stay here, only on the strip and would make a trip just to eat their buffet.  The food is starting to taste like your typical buffet.  Nothing really special.  Same selection with subpar taste.  If you are a crab lover, then this is good for you since they serve both warm and cold carb legs.  Lines can be crazy so come early or late.
Food was okay for buffet standards. Don't be fooled by the inexpensive rating. The place was quite spendy - over $70 for 2 people and no drinks.
This buffet was not so good. Line was long and not well organized. Food was eh and they charged 25$ for barefoot brand wine. If you choose to go, arrive when it opens and but the pass from groupon.
