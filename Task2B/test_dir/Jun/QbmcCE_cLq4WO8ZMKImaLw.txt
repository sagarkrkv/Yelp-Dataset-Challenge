Hash house is always an option whenever I'm in Vegas. Portions are huge so sharing might be a good idea.. . I've had the Chorizo Hash and also Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Both are delicious! . . The location at The Quad is also open 24/7.
Maybe I'm bad at selecting worthwhile entrees, or maybe Hash House focuses on presentation over taste. The service is excellent, the portions are huge, the atmosphere is fun. BUT, of the three entrees I've ordered at this location, the food was bland and forgettable. Chicken & waffles look fantastic when delivered, but the chicken is dry and the sage flavoring is blah - huge disappointment and very hard to eat. The pancakes are huge but again the flavor is bland. This last time I went conservative and had a simple chicken Caesar salad and -ack- it was an anchovy based dressing. My fault this time as I know it's common and I should have asked but come on,  who actually likes anchovy Caesar dressing? Bleck. The pork cutlet and meatloaf meals the others ordered looked good. I guess I'll try one of those if I'm drug to Hash House again in the future.
The portions are HUGE! If I went back I would just get one plate to split. I got the chicken and biskets and waffles.  They were both very good and lived up to the hype.
Went for breakfast on Saturday 5/31. There was definitely a crowd, but reading the reviews on here, we were fine with waiting. They said it would be about a 35 min wait, but it was really maybe 15-20. The menu is great. I wanted to try one of everything. :) I ordered the House Hash - Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomato and fresh spinach. It was great. SO much food. I even ate the biscuit and I don't really eat much bread. the biscuit was crispy on the outside. So good. I definitely recommend this place. The service was great as well. Wow, it can be super  busy and you get good service? Love it. I have already recommended this place to a friend of mine who  has family in vegas. They will be trying this place out now :) I will be back as well.
American obesity at its most shameless!. Don't get me wrong, it's tasty. Pile fried chicken and scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy and bacon AND CHEESE on mashed potatoes, and it's gonna taste good.. . Same with bananas and brown sugar in a pancake.. . The portions are HUGE and the prices are low (by major city standards), so it's easy to understand why people like it here.. . I gave 3 stars for 2 reasons, neither of which having to do with taste:. . 1) the location is depressing. It's dark and crammed at the top of an escalator in the Quad (former Imperial Palace), and has zero ambiance. Not that one would expect romance, but it's really just sad and weird and ugly.. . There's no bathroom in the restaurant (or so I was told by the hostess), so if the feeling strikes you, prepare for another trip back down the escalator and into the casino.. . 2) it's like, socially irresponsible to serve portions that large.
We came here because we have been to the San Diego one and loved it. Beware, they get very crowded at all times. But that is pretty much the same story for any good food place in Vegas. The menu is a little smaller than the normal Hash House but the food was delicious. I got the Farm Scramble with tomatoes, goat cheese and basil. I really really enjoyed that. The goat cheese was the perfect pairing for it. We also got their bloodies- the bacon one. I liked it but it was pretty spicy which I did not expect. It didn't say it was going to be spicy on the menu like some of the others did. It was harder to drink for me. Also, their bloody mary menu is very tiny compared to the normal Hash House which was a little disappointing. All in all, the food and service were really good just don't expect a great selection when it comes to bloodies (something they are known for).
Pretty good! The wait time wasn't bad for a Sunday morning, I expected a lot worse. It's a cool place overall. Our server Fonda was very pleasant and quick. The food was yummy, portions are ENORMOUS. I got the chorizo scramble and it's served in this massive cast iron skillet. It was good but the chorizo tasted a bit like chili which makes me wonder what was in it. My husband got the fried chicken benedict and this thing was a heart attack on a plate with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, bacon, cream gravy, eggs, etc. . . Overall - not too shabby for a local chain. I don't know if I'll be back but it wasn't bad by any means.
I was about to turn around and take the escalator back down because of the god awful line that has formed on a Saturday morning, luckily my best friend is a platinum total rewards card holder and we didn't have to wait very long, food still took forever to come out, but we amused ourselves with silly conversations and the time flew by. Our waiter was great, he had a great sense of humor and knew how to calm the restless villagers. I was so hungry, I was about to eat my arm.. . Apparently when the food arrived, I just started shoveling my pie hole as fast as I could without saying a word, I was in the zone, enjoying my chicken & waffles. My friends were talking to me and I just kept ignoring them, no time to conversate, must eat everything off the plate, I did try but the portions were huge, I just couldn't finish it.. . We had a great breakfast, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, I was so stuffed afterwards I had to go back to my hotel and take a nappy nap zzzZZZZZZZZZ
It was pretty damn good. I had the sage chicken and egg Benedict (MvF) and it was delicious! The portion size was huge! We waited for a table for about 35 minutes but once we were seated our orders were taken quickly and the food arrived fast. I suggest ordering one of their bloody Mary's while you wait because they are quite tasty and help with hangovers... Especially the one I had. Haha.
This flap jack was soo good and also HUGE!! Service was friendly and it didn't take too long to get the food either. Will def go again!
Out of all the places I visited at Vegas, THIS is the one that I can't WAIT to come back to. . . We were greeted warmly and waited for a half an hour for a spot. To be expected as this place was buzzing with hype. We marveled at the hostesses yelling voice as she called for party after party after party. . . We sat and the server was fun and spunky and had a slight twang. Loved it.. . We shares three plates for five grown ass men. We walked out full. . . The Benedict is to die for. I will be eating this every time I come back to Vegas. The other two dishes were great as well but just weren't as memorable as that Benedict. Something about that conglomeration of great foods with that chipotle sauce.... . Walked out extremely satisfied. I will definitely be back.
Finally got to try the Food Network renowned Hash House A Go Go.. . We got here at around 8-ish on a Saturday morning; and the wait was already about 30mins.. . It's like... "c'mon people...aren't you all supposed to be dead tired on your beds from partying last night?" --No.. not the case.. apparently.. there are a lot of breakfast enthusiasts that actually do come on breakfast time (They do serve their menu all day...24/7 okay).... . Cory and I got seated on a little booth by the bar on the left. Even my tall husband said the table was too high. Let's just say it wasn't too ergonomic for eating.. Our server's name was: Sassy..... She got our drink orders and Cory and I already knew what our orders were even before being seated.. so we gave that to Sassy too..... . What i like about Hash house is that... It doesn't have a cellphone network coverage for AT&T!!! And it didn't seem like they had wi-fi either.. . So pretty much all my check-ins and foodie Instagram photos had to wait..... But I liked how Cory and I got to spend the whole breakfast date...Phone less... How liberating. I was a bit on edge.. but it was awesome. We played with straw wrappers; we checked each other's noses for boogers... we made faces at each other. Yes.. lots of things you can do while waiting for your order.. . Anyway.... . My gigantic SAGE CHICKEN AND BACON WAFFLES walked over to the table (like seriously, it covered Sassy's head while she was walking towards our table).... and man was it seriously massive. My jaw dropped and I instantly gained 5 lbs after it was placed on our table.. Let's just say that It was a different taste of Chicken and a different taste of Waffle.. The chicken is deep fried and breaded but with a hint of herb. It lingered in aroma that at one point; i thought i was eating a grilled chicken breast. Ha! Not.. The Bacon Waffle completely took me over the edge.They weren't little bits of bacon okay. There were huge pieces of bacon embedded in that waffle. . The plate came with two JUMBO pieces of chicken; and 4 jumbo pieces of waffle. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.. . Cory got the SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT.... Oh dear lord.. that hollandaise that covered the whole plate? it looked like it was whisked into butter submission goodness perfection.. Rich.Good.. Yummy.. Fried Chicken yummy.. give it to me. I personally liked his better than mine. . And once again.. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.. . Highly Recommend to those seeking comfort food that can compensate bad hangovers.. . I gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if i liked the taste of the food itself; or if i was just overwhelmed with their extraordinary way of plating. I mean.. my two chickens were atop each other on a stack of waffles secured with a huge steak knife.. I'd have to give this another shot again and try simpler items on the menu to break down their food artistry and concentrate on their flavors.. . Both our orders plus a little banana Latte was close to $50.00++. So... it could get pricey for two people..
Pretty Good! wasn't "wowed" by the overall taste probably because of all the hype, but this place is legit! huge portions, fresh food! great place... a must in Vegas!
Hands down was one of the best chicken and waffle we ever had. A friend of ours recommended it to us and she forgot to mention that the serving was huge haha. . . I felt very disappointed with their shrimp appetizer. Way too over pricey. I believe it was 9.99 for 3 pieces of shrimp on a stick. . . Good selection of drinks and dessert tho.
The food is a lot more beautiful than it actually tastes. I was sucked in by the succulent pictures. But the food was really just meh. Not bad price. Definitely large portion. But I think this place and the rest in this chain are over-hyped. If you're hungry though and want a big display of food, come here.
This place serves pretty good food. Be prepared to wait a while for table. Unless you're a platinum total rewards member like myself. You can then skip to the front of the line. I was in Vegas for about 4 days and I came here 2 days in a row for brunch. There fried chicken is so moist and delicious. I also really enjoyed there pancakes. They are huge!!! . . Staff here are super friendly. Food does take a while to come out but I was prepared for that already after I read that at the bottom if the menu.
Its only saving grace - that it's 24 hours.
There is nothing bad i can say about this place. The amount of food is incredible the quality is great and the twist on the classics are terrific. I had the man vs food sage chicken benedict. Friends had the chicken and waffle and the stuffed burger. Everyone enjoyed. If your not a big eater find someone you can share the dish with. Or you will be taking home food.
So, the service was AWESOME except....They didn't offer me a brunch menu, so I had no idea I could have gotten delicious breakfast food this evening. . The food, not so awesome. At all. . I ordered a cobb salad with cucumber ranch dressing. It was huge, but not so flavorful. I kept looking for salty bacon and distinct red onion, and somehow, it was just bland. The tomatoes were good. *shrug*. The homemade biscuit was dense and insanely dry. Like, reminding us that we're in the middle of the desert and I'm desperately grasping the glass of water before my dried out throat shuts down on me.. I wrapped most of the salad up to go (not that death biscuit) because it's HUGE as the menu suggests, and took a slice of cheesecake to go, too. That was also enormous, and freaking flavorless. Well, not completely lacking flavor... It... It tastes like cream cheese brulee. Yeah. Almost burnt cream cheese. Not a hint of vanilla or sugar. Like maybe the cook got distracted and forgot that they didn't put anything but cream cheese and butter in it? I seriously would be better off getting a bagel and spreading this on it. Worst cheesecake I've ever tasted. . I'm absolutely heart-broken.
My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for the first time. We decided to split the chicken and waffles plate since the portions are soo large and let me tell you the. Chicken was sooo tender and the bacon waffles were so tasty too.There was lots of people waiting to get seated but it went really fast and the service was quick and friendly.We also tried the watermelon lemonade and its was very tasty and not too sweet!. I highly recommend this place and cant wait to go back.
Try the brown sugar banana pancakes they are awesome I loved this place amazingly large portions!
Yuuuukkkkkkk. Just yuk. Who wants pancakes bigger than your head? Nope, not me. Who wants drunk people at literally every single table. Nope, not a chance. . . We sat down at 7am when it was still a little quiet. And the only redeeming experience was Bri, the server, who was very polite. Around 730, this idiot guest came in and started talking to all the people around us, including shouting, "what's up, fatty?!?" to this guy who had just sat down. . . The reason its getting 3 stars is because the TASTE of the food wasn't bad and the server was nice. But, Never Again.
I will start this off with the fact that I am not a fan of breakfast...and I LOVED this place for breakfast. The portions are humongous, the food is tasty beyond belief, and the staff is so friendly. The whole place has such a good vibe to it. I ordered the quesadilla which had eggs, mashed potatoes, cheese, jalapenos, nacho cheese sauce, and a bunch of other stuff that I couldn't even recognize but it tasted so good. I couldn't finish it all, which makes sense since I believe the restaurant was featured on Man vs Food. Go there expecting to wait at least 15 minutes because it is so popular. The short wait is totally worth it. While waiting, check out all the celebrities who havesigned pictures for the restaurant or take a look at the menu on the wall, or even dare I say walk around the restaurant and take a gander at what everyone is eating so you can start salivating.
First timer in Vegas and everyone raved about this place. Amazing food, friendly staff. Our waiter Toby was phenomenal!!! I'd recommend this place to everyone and I will definitely be back.
I know its gluttonous, but I love it!!  Every trip to Vegas includes a FAT meal at Hash House!  the first tome at this location, I found for a Saturday morning the wait was less, I'm sure its because the place gigantic, and locals aren't going to come to the strip if try can help it.
Oh the hype! The many celebrity endorsement pictures on the walls ! And then Oh The Fall :(.   I have never before had such dry and overcooked food! Really?! I mean, how could they release that plate of food to the table? I ordered the "Salmon Scramble" (the Salmon hash dish) & my Son ordered the "Chicken scramble".  BOTH dishes were dry, dry, dry and the potatoes were so overcooked they were almost black. Soooo disappointing! Food was also underseasoned. Our server was a nice fellow, transplanted from the east coast. I will not be returning to Hash House a Go Go.   A waste of a LOT of money.
We had a party of 9 and rolled in about 4:30am. The waiter was okay, we all wanted coffee so he brought out 2 fresh pots for the table. I ordered the most simple thing on the menu: 2 egg breakfast w/biscuit, fruit and potatoes. The rest of the group split their large portion specialties like chicken and waffles, steak and eggs, and a double cheese burger - these portions are worthy of sharing and everyone was having a blast with the portions and presentation. for me: my eggs were ON POINT and the biscuit is up there with the best. My one food complaint: the potatoes on the other hand: dry and flavorless. I was bummed about this and took a star and a half for that. The waiter was just okay - another half star down. THe prices were good considering the large portions. Will def return to this and other HHGG locations - and next time I will  try a gastro meal like my group had.
Love this place! I always get the famous man versus food and chicken and waffle! The portions are huge! Great price.
First of all, THANK YOU to the person on here who gave the tip about sitting at the bar. We didn't have to wait at all so that as great! We enjoyed our breakfasts, I had eggs, bacon and a huge pancake, hubby had an enormous ham and cheese omelet. The only bummer was that they were out of the tea I wanted so I ordered coffee then found out they don't have non-dairy creamer, boo, what about lactose intolerant people? It was pricey ($40 for 2 of usfor breakfast) but I would go back.
Buttermilk biscuits are worth the trip
If a place can get by from being on a Food Network show alone, this is it. The signature chicken blows. Why? Because rosemary doesn't pair well with chicken. And it needs to be crispy, not soggy. Same goes for the "crispy" potatoes; soggsville. The bacon was as limp as Don Rickles's dick. Not sure what would have happened if asked for crispy. Also, way overpriced. $3 for a cup of coffee that tastes like it was filtered through the tighty whiteys you wore on the plane to Vegas? No thanks. Finally, they couldn't even manage to get the dishes out together for a party of two. Come on; that's just lazy.
The food rocked. I got the sage fried chicken eggs Benedict. It was enough to feed 2.  My fiance got the pecan banana French toast and it was great. Our server, Tony, was awesome. The food came quickly too. Def going back in a few days.
If you're not the breakfast buffet type, you MUST come here. It's life-changing. And it's always open, so stuff yourself whenever the mood strikes.. . I came with my boyfriend right before the breakfast rush, and we are so thankful we beat the crowd. Among the people who approve of this place: Dr. Phil and Jon Taffer.. . I got what sounded like the perfect vegetarian hash: sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, eggs and a biscuit. My BF got a quesadilla. Now, when we first ordered we had a little moment of "oh god, how much is this going to cost us?" And THEN we saw the portions. They are phenomenal. They could easily feed 2 people. Or easily nurse a hangover.. . Our food arrived pretty fast...and it was hash house HEAVEN. My picky eating partner said it was his favorite thing he's ever eaten, and I was blown away by my fabulous meal. Considering the size and the flavor, the prices were just right.. . As a bonus - the drinks are cool! Get a boozy coffee concoction or a beer in a brown bag (lol).. . You simply can't go one more Vegas breakfast without coming here.
Hash House A Go Go is always jam packed but don't let this deter you!  The restaurant is quite large so even though you see tons of folks waiting it's usually about a 20-30 minute wait (at least from what I experienced around lunch time).. . Food: PORTION SIZES ARE HUGEEEEE. You should probably order a few things and split it with a group.  I tried scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and brie cheese and it was delicious!!! I also had their waffles which were okay but nothing to write home about.  I tried the watermelon kiwi lemonade drink and that was delicious but might be considered too sweet and syrupy for a few folks. BTW their bloody mary is delicious, didn't try the BLT version but that's on my to-do list.. I saw quite a few orders of the chicken & waffles..I guess that's the popular dish around here.. . Decor: industrial + farm. . Service: good nothing to complain about.. . Price - Affordable especially for all the food you're getting. . . Would I go back? - heck yes. I want to try their smores hot chocolate!!
You HAVE to go to this restaurant.  I first heard about it from some friends who had made reservations for all of us for breakfast.  I said "reservations, for breakfast??" Well, it is such a popular place, even on a Thursday morning, that you had better make those reservations!   Good food, lots-o-food, and good times to be had.  Service a little slow, but the place was packed, so I understood.. Wild name for a restaurant, too!
Took a cab form the Cosmo over to The Quad. First things first - The Quad has been renovated, but still has a long way to go. That said, Hash House is fantastic. We arrived around 10am and the place was packed. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to eat.. . In the end, it was well worth the wait. I opted for the veggie hash. It included sun dried tomatoes, potatoes, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. It was huge. Far more than I could eat. I did not order them, but tons of people got pancakes. They looked out of sights.. . N*joy...
Was super crowded.  HUGE portions, too much.  Salad overloaded with dressing. Sage fried chicken not so flavorful .
The food was so so. They are known for their very large portions. So I just got the tenderloin pork Benedict. I was sharing it and still had almost half of it to finish. It reminded me of a pork Katsu just with gravy, eggs, spinach, tomatoes, and a biscuit. I would probably go here again if I was really hungry. . . Other than that they staff was nice. Although I had to wait 25 minutes to get in. When I got in they told me it would take another 45 minutes for the food to be ready. I am willing to wait for good food but this is not a place I would wait for again.
We liked HH so much we went twice for breakfast and we were only there for two days.  Both times we got there around 10:30, and had less than a half hour wait for a table.  Neither time did we have someone telling us it would take half an hour for food once we ordered.. . Of course we had to have the chicken and waffles.  For us, the star of the dish was the waffle - not too sweet, and being extra decadent with bits of bacon in the waffle mix.  It was great!  The chicken was good as well, but could have stood some more flavouring in the batter.  The chicken was nice and crispy, and I ordered the sauce on the side - for those of you who complained about the chicken being soggy, I'm guessing that might solve this issue.  I liked having the sauce on the side so I could dip as needed.. . Other dishes we had was the farm scramble (so good, and love the biscuit) and the BBBLT (they are very serious about the back on this.  . . Pricing was great for the Strip, and I've already told many others about this place.
I fell in love with this place in San Diego so getting the chance to go back was a no-brainer. Although the decor isn't nearly as nice as the San Diego location, the food is equally amazing. A native Hoosier, the pork tenderloin sandwich tends to be elusive outside of Indiana so when I find one the rest of the menu becomes irrelevant. Clara ("show me the beef" fame) would be excited to see that the meat significantly dwarfs the bun. In fact it is the sized of a normal dinner plate. On top of that was the side dish of mashed potatoes covered in strips of bacon and smothered in cheese -- had to have been at least a pound. I hear their breakfast is equally as good. I took three college athletes who all amazingly scarfed down their meals with no problem. Another bonus was the price. While Vegas is known for price gouging, the prices here are normal for 3x the amount of food.
What a nice surprise.  We were up early and ran into this place walking through the Quad.  Only expected basic diner food since we have never head of this place.  Was I wrong.   This place was incredible.  Best breakfast I've ever had in Vegas.  Highly recommended.  Everything we had was great and every plate coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.
I'd like to start out by stating I was fairly hung over the day we went to Hash House A Go Go. After a long hard night for my liver, I had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). And even though thehangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. That being said, we  walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.. . I only complain about the situation I was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. The corned beef sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. The cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. And the meat. So succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. The portions were well aligned with the price as this is no Dennys or Ihop. The price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. I could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. This hearty meal was just what I needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.. . All in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. The only flaws I saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino. I'll recommend this place for a decently, delightful devouring during daddy's drinking day recovery.
Love this place. Everything is amazing! If you're a foodie, you have to check out this place. Fun atmosphere and killer food.
The BLT Bloody Mary is a must have.  The food is great.  You get a lot for your money, and worth the wait.
Overhyped. Overhyped. Overhyped. The food doesn't taste good and it comes out in huge portions. A big plate of non yummy food. I feel like breakfast made at home taste way better than this. Save your money. Do it yourself. . . Mushroom burger - meat was kind of dry, big burger. Also pricey but not tasty. Whyyyyy. . . Basic - ham, over medium egg, crispy potatoes. This is a super basic dish and I picked this because everything else looked really intense and they still managed to serve me something that I can make better myself. . . Sage fried chicken - dried chicken, it also tasted kind of sweet. Gross. . . Original hash Benedict - loads of food but also meh. The bacon tasted like pork rinds. . . Banana pancake - this thing is huge! I would say this is the best tasting out of everything we ordered but they also forgot to put this in and it took forever to come out. We finished our food, paid for the bill, and waited an extra 15mins for this pancake. . . I won't be back.
The wait here is crazy... because it's Hash House in a casino on the Strip, so duh!  You can get a drink to liven up your wait a bit, though. The bloody mary is actually very good. And large... like everything else here. . . The portions are huge and sickeningly so.  It wouldn't surprise me if they adopted a policy of wheeling food out in a wheelbarrow -- it would fit the theme perfectly!  Every plate I saw cleared around us was still half full, as the TV was playing a commercial to help starving African kids.  It felt pretty indecentto be throwing away all this food just for some 'Murican farmhouse gimmick. . . The flavors were good, but everything just kind of gave me indigestion.  The Benedicts come with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. Everything's just a little overboard.  The smoked salmon Benedict isn't with lox how you would expect it to be, but salmon with smoke flavoring. It was still pretty good, but wasn't what I thought I was ordering.. . I think the gimmick wins over the actual experience.  When your food first appears in front of you, you're kind of star-struck and giddy.  But about 3 bites in, you realize you're just about done and there's no fridge in your hotel room.
HH review. . First recommendation do not get the pineapple juice mimosa. I love pineapple juice but these two were not meant to be mixed together. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and DMD ordered the cheddar burger. Our waitress was adorable, and very attentive. . Both our meals were very good, but the presentation of the waffles and chicken the table got next to us was spectacular. I was told they have one of these in Orlando, but if never heard if it. We were not disappointed
The food was absolutely amazing, and I loved all my food. Although it was a bit loud, it didn't take away from the food. My waffle was very fluffy and not as heavy as usual american breakfast food. I also had a side of fruit which was very refreshing. Definitely recommend!
There was no wait but we did go in at 11pm. We owed the Sage Chicken and Waffles to share and we still didn't finish it as it was enormous as other yelpes have stated regarding their portion size. In sure it could have easily fed 2 adults and 2 small children or 3 adults and still be filling.  The price was decent concidering the actual size of the meal but that's pretty much all your paying for as the services was just okay. The presentation of the meal was great and almost floored me when it came out because of how much food was on the plate. The chicken was good if you like A LOT of batter. I felt it needed a little something for me to make it stand out a bit more but all in all not bad.  The four heavy waffles included in the meal had bacon slices cooked in it which was nice but really if I didn't see it while eating it, I wouldn't have even noticed it was there since the waffle itself over powered it in flavor.
HHAGG.. you win this one.. but only because of chicken and waffles... short story long:. . Walked in and was greeted, took 20 minutes to seat us.. (for 2) and it was packed.. . . Ordered 2 bloody Marys (BLT style) and biscuits and gravy, extra Bacon,  and my chicken and waffles. The waiter who took the order asked if we wanted crispy potatoes, we said yes. Asked how we wanted the eggs, we said over easy.. comes back, and says he put in over medium.. So he fixed it to over easy.. then put came the drinks, the bloody Marys were amazing! Best bloody Mary I've had! The food came out and the potatoes were not crispy... they were mashed... we just decided to go with it.. but my chicken. and waffles, AMAZING!!! :) so amazing and so portion friendly that I had enough for dinner and breakfast the next day! :)
The food is absolutely amazing. The wait however is not. It took an hour to get three of us seated. I ordered the man vs. food item (chicken Benedict) and it was delicious. The food is so good it makes you almost forget about the terrible wait.
SPLIT AN ENTREE!!!!! Unless you can eat 4 big mac meals in one sitting, then order one entree to yourself.  Pig.. . Pros: . 24/7. Fast food, . comfort food. large portions. . cons:. Gets busy (b/c it's good). service (they aren't the brightest people that work here) . . I came to this location inside the Quad around 3am and was told we could sit at the bar or wait 15 minutes to be seated in the dining room (which we could see was not seated at all) but okay so we sat at the bar.. . Ordered the Sausage biscuit: Basically Biscuits and gravy with chunks of sausage over a bed of mash potatoes.  Yum you say.... yes YUM indeed.. however as I was eating this mound of mush (minus the biscuit which wasn't visible but was rock hard) I didn't eat one piece of sausage until I was 1/4 don't with a rock hard biscuit... . . My boyfriend who started at the other end of the plate, got a million pieces of delicious sausage and didn't eat any biscuit until he was already full. We both discovered the mash potatoes when our pants were going to explode.  . . Since this was 5th meal (literally) it did the job and put us to sleep.. . Service here sucked.  but food is always solid.
Great service, large portions, served fast, pretty good taste !! I ordered the blueberry pecan pancakes and tried the french toast too!! One of the diners and dives places and not very pricey!! Great way to start the day after a night in las vegas. All types of people come here to eat including celebs.
I've been wanting to try HHAGG for the longest time & on my last Vegas trip I finally gave in! And I'm glad I went to try it. Though it's given that any place you go at the strip is crowded specially if it's a popular restaurant, so expect that there will be a wait time when you go. If you don't want to wait for 30mins-hour try to go to the HHAGG off the strip. But I'm telling you, wait or no wait it's worth it!!!. . First off, the portions are HUGE!!! One plate can definitely be split into two or three if you have small appetite. You'll definitely leave with a full stomach after you're done. Their food is very flavorful. The most popular food on the menu are their Sage Chicken & Waffle and the Sage chicken eggs Benedict which was featured at the show Man vs. Food. Both were amazing! But since I'm not into spicy food & the sage chicken Benedict is more on the spicy side I like The sage chicken & waffles more. It was bomb!!!! Their waffles have bacon inside & the chicken was really good. It has a different sweet but savory flavor to it. You have to try it!!!
This place is open 24/7! So convenient for us when we were staying at The Quad! Now, I've lived in San Diego for 4 years & I've tried to place & never understood the hype. Yes, huge portions, but mediocre taste.. . However, when I tried this place again, I was mindblown by the fried chicken benedict. The infusions of flavor was incredible & not what I was expecting. There's also mashed potatoes underneath it, that are very flavorful! GET THIS!
This place is great! We came here on a Thursday morning around 11am and had a 15 min wait not too bad. Our server was great very friendly and offered good suggestions on what to order. I had the ham, cheddar, spinach scramble with mashed potatos and it was bomb! The biscuits were my favorite part sooooo fluffy. The only negative was waiting for the actual order it took a long time for breakfast about 30min. But they were pretty packed. We will be back again the next time we are back in Vegas.
Before leaving to Vegas, my coworker insisted that I should eat at Hash House. We have one in Califonria, but she said that Vegas is a lot better. Well, since my coworker is so in love with this particular location, I had to try it out. My group of friends and I came on a busy summer Saturday morning around 11am. The hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. Go figure....because when we walked up the stairs (yes it is located upstairs of Harris Casino), we can see a large crowd of people, either standing or sitting. The waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. . We waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting. So we asked the girl who took down my number if we can order something to go and she said yes and told us to order itwith the bartender. So my boyfriend and I walked over to the bartender and tried to get our orders in, but no one acknowledged us....We were literally flagging down the bartenders and the waiters but they just ignored it. I understand that this place gets packed and busy, but please dayummmn rude.  About 20 minutes in, we were finally asked "How can I help you?" At that time, our name was called and we ended up dining in.. We ended up ordering 2 items:. 1. Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! This portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. For something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! The plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, and eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. I finished a little portion and had the worst food coma I've had in a while. . 2. Of course we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  The waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! Major plus for the bacon eaters! The chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. The fried chicken was delicious, perfectly made and so moist. It wasn't all greasy like the chicken you would get from Popeyes or KFC. . Everything was so delicious, and none of us finished out plates. There were 6 of us by the way. I will definitely come back, at an odd hour like 5am to avoid the wait. I hope the staffs can help us faster next time.. Its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth.
We were disappointed overall. The salads were good however the hash was not at all. Sad since this is their namesake we expected it would at least be good but that wasn't the case. Would not recommend & prices are inflated for what you get.
We only had a 10 minute wait.  From all the reviews I was worried,  so glad it was quick.  The portions are ridiculous.... In a good way.  Huge,  way too much for most but I loved it.  I got the corned beef hash since it's a "Hash House"  bomb! My wife got the chicken and waffles, huge huge portion and tasted great! I will definitely come back. Thanks!
If you are really really hungry I would suggest eating here. They have lots to choose from and their serving portions are HUUGE! Which is not that bad for their menu pricing. . . The only thing is that they are always crowded especially in the morning on the weekends. I've only eaten here twice and had to wait a while to be seated each time. So expect a line if you don't get there before they open. The unfortunate thing is that you can't make reservations and cell phone reception is terrible so if you're trying to get a hold of people who are meeting with you there do it before entering. . . Other than that their food is good. So far I've tried their mushroom Swiss burger and their banana nut french toast which was delish!
I've always wanted to try this place and finally did. I ordered the cast iron skillet cornbread, which was good, then I had their smoked salmon hash which was just okay. My fiance had a salmon burger which he said was pretty good and the portion was huge!. Although, I didn't feel the welcoming vibe as we walked up to the front. There were four people at the host stand and they were all just too busy doing sidework and chitchatting with each other but hey, we were fed in a timely manner so whatever and our server was nice and attentive. I should've tried one of their humongous burgers but there's always next time. I'll come back and give it another shot next time I'm in town.
Had breakfast and dinner here. Service friendly. Restaurant clean..  . BREAKFAST- Of course I had to have the Corned Beef Hash. It was not that good, surprisingly. It was dry.. . DINNER- I had heard that the Hamburgers are good here. So I tried it... it was excellent. I started with a salad that only comes with cucumber dressing. It was very good. I ordered the Hamburger with a single patty, because I knew of the huge portions. Near perfect, quality beef, fresh baked buns, extra crispy fries.
My first time here. This is for the one at The Quad hotel next to Harrah's on the Strip. Ummm...I liked it. A lot. My wife, daughter and I had brunch here on Saturday afternoon. The food here is what they call "twisted farm food". It really is a good description of what they serve. It's high quality food that is creatively and well prepared. .       The restaurant itself is busy and bustling 24 hours a day. Decorated in a farmhouse motif, the staff is constantly moving in and out of the kitchen delivering plates of very large portions of food. .        Our server, Erik was friendly and accommodating. We perused the large and varied brunch menu while he brought our drinks. The menu has some really good sounding dishes. The signature dish here is the sage fried chicken tower. It consists of 2 large fried chicken breasts sitting on top of 3 homemade waffles. I saw a lot of people having it and it looks...really good. Maybe next time on that one. .         We each chose one of the "scrambles". I had the smoked salmon scramble with mashed potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The scramble itself was good but not out of this world. Nothing I couldn't make in my own kitchen. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Probably the best Iv'e had. The biscuit is huge and has a hint of rosemary and also a large spring of rosemary sticking out of the top. It was excellent as well. My wife and daughter had basically the same thing except they had different ingredients in their scrambles and my wife had crispy potatoes instead of mashed. We all liked our dishes very much. .         On this Saturday afternoon, this place looked like the place to go to cure a hangover. More than a few people looked like they were in pretty bad shape..        This location is the only one that is open 24/7/365.  I can definitely see putting Hash House A Go Go on our regular rotation. I can't wait to return to try the sage fried chicken or one of the Benedicts..         If you don't believe me, check out my kid's reveiw below..
Good food for great prices! I hate wasting food and being on vacation meant that 80% of the meal went to waste. I would suggest sharing if you can. Also - they said they only take reservations 24 hours in advance and this place gets craaazzzzy busy, especially on Sunday lateish morning.
Everything was AWSOME. I got the famous chicken and waffles with a Bloody Mary. I was so stuffed after half of this giant portion but I just couldn't stop eating and forced myself to keep going. Prices were reasonable compared to most places around. I will return and would recommend to anyone.
Wow! The first thing that comes to mind when we got our food! But first I must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when I went to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago. I saw it on the food network and travel channel. Apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the Vegas strip in the Quad.. . Upon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. That being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! Worth it in the end though.. . As we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. In my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. I felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. The first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. Out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! The ones were the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Big O' Chicken Pot Pie and the Chorizo House Hash. Full menus are online, but each dish was super! . . My personal favorite was the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. This was superb! The sage really was present in the fried chicken and was totally different from any other "chicken & waffles" I ever had. The taste was really "upscale" but very, very good! The other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. I am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that I had never had before. The fried chicken was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! The Everyone loved the waffles! Very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. And it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...Such a dream! . . The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was similar in taste as far as the fried chicken portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. Very rich and good.. . The last two were the Chorizo House Hash and Big O' Chicken Pot Pie. Both were the favorites among the group as a whole. The chorizo was very good, not too salty, which I have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. A bit spicy with the jalapenos, but I love spice personally. Everyone devoured this dish as well as the Pot Pie. The shell/crust of the pot pie was mouthwatering. That part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the roasted chicken filling and gravy!. . I must say these dishes individually are Large! Just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. And for the price, very worth it! Each dish was presently superbly especially the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.. . This is a super recommendation if you are ever nearby or decide to take a trip to Las Vegas! Go Now!
We sat down and were blessed with a great waiter.  This makes a huge difference in your dining experience!  . . The BLT Bloody Mary...yum!  While I don't pay the price for drinks in Vegas, this one is worth it.  It's the best Bloody Mary I've had.  The price is tolerable because of it's deliciousness and the glass you get to keep!. . It is hard to describe the size of plates and amount of food.  You definitely should/could share anything on the menu.  But if you're like us, we all wanted to try something a little different so we have snacks for tomorrow. . . Overall, we loved it.  The service, unique "twisted farm food", tasty sauces, and beautiful presentation have us wanting to eat here again!
Love this place!! If you are on a diet, don't come here. Large portions and great tasting food. The pancake was about the size of a hubcap... No joke !!
