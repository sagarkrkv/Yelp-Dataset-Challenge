June 6 20.14 resort  fee alone is $2 0 per night non negotiable, tax on that too.  A $20 room costs 40. . .  Lots of hookers and pimps. . , non English staff throughout .  Always full of Asian tourists which is ok, But frustrating to the non English staff so by the time they come in ask you when you what you want to drink or eat there already was really angry. .  the thing I noticed is now they want families in there so men in women with children can come and Gamble and spend their money while a 10 year old watches 3 5 year olds upstairs next to you in your room.  Try not to get a connecting room.. . Free wifi, that's new.. . SMOKEY!  Bring oxygen. . . Slots and Video Poker that drink ladies do not come around at all you'll waste 50 in a video poker machine and still not get a drink. and of course when they do come around they act like they're doing you a favor
I would have to say this place made a lot of improvements since our last visit a few years ago. We would normally stay at South Point Casino because they had a bowling alley, theater, and free wifi. What attracted us this time was the rate. At $29.99, it was a steal despite not knowing the improvements. The cable channels are more entertaining. And they now offer free wifi!!! The only con was we had a window view of the AC Systems, but we were on the floor where the pool was, fair exchange. Now the pool? You could smell the chlorine and the music was a little loud. Only gripe, it closes too early, 7pm. Overall, the stay was good.
This hotel wasn't that bad. I came here about six or seven years ago with my parents. Sometimes they like to go on Vegas trips and I decided to to go with them on this one. From what I remember it wasn't such a dud. It's a pretty decent size and the beds weren't uncomfortable to sleep in. The AC was pretty loud though and the interior design looked a little out dated but it's tolerable and not to much of an eye sore. I never tried their famous rides on the top of the hotel but I think I'll pass on rides that are a thousand stories up. The buffet was okay, nothing outstanding but enough to choose from. I would say my stay here wasn't bad, great, or exciting. But it's a good place to stay and crash in for a few nights so you can check out Vegas. You might also get a good deal on the price.
A solid 3 stars. Pros: easy on the budget, good customer service, very organized valet service, plenty of onsite amenities, strong security presence.  Cons: on the very edge of main strip, sketchy surrounding neighborhood, no shuttle service to the center of the strip. We would stay here again.
Stayed here in October 2013 with my family. It is a beautiful hotel, with amazing rates. It is close to everything but loses one star for location for me. I like to be right in the centre of everything when I'm in Vegas, but I'm lazy like that, realistically it's probably a 15 minute walk to the centre of the strip! . . Pool area is nice, the hotel rooms are very clean and roomy. The staff were pretty nice and they have really good rates. So if you're on a tight budget this is a great place to stay!!
If I could give ZERO stars, I would.  We stayed here for our Las Vegas wedding. We planned on staying 5 nights..... 1) day 1, they did not have a room for us. I made the reservations back in April.  So we got a different room with the promise that the room I reserved would be ready in the morning.  IT WASN'T!  So we stayed in the other room the remainder of our stay. . 2)housekeeping is a joke. Day 2, a trash can , sheets, and towels were left on the floor next to the door...I was confused, so I found a housekeeper and asked why they just left it, she just looked at me like I was crazy.  I finally said "do you want me to make the bed myself?"  Her reply was "could you?"  Uh no, that's what I paid you for.  Of course, I didn't say that.  I just said "if you don't mind, we'll leave it there for you." . 3) first 2 nights, we literally sweated to death, it was 80 degrees in the room.  We finally called and they fixed it....but then we froze to death.  And couldn't get it turn off.  It was either feast or famine.  . 4) customer service was the worst I've ever had.  Rude housekeeping, rude front desk, rude concierge. . 5) the day of my wedding...at 1:45 our room still hadn't been cleaned.  I had a lady coming to do my hair and makeup at 2:00, so my fiance went to very nicely ask when our room was going to be cleaned.  The lady very rudely told him she had no idea. . 6) still the day of my wedding...at 2:45 housekeeping shows up as I'm getting my hair done. Which was fine, we tried staying out of her way.  She spilled water all over the floor and did not clean it up.  I stepped out of the room, the housekeeper turned off all the lights WITH MY HAIR LADY STILL IN THERE, after turning out all the lights, she walked out and shut the door... WITH MY HAIR LADY STILL IN THERE,  so I was locked out of my room with my hair lady still inside!  Uh.....okay?!  So I had to knock on my own door to have my hair lady open it back up for me!. 7) day 4....at noon, we decided we had had enough!  So I went to the front desk and said we were leaving a day early!  I demanded a refund for the last night and resort fees and the ridiculous charge we'd already paid on a refrigerator for 4 nights.  She knew I wasn't moving until I got a refund so she gave it to me.  . I will never stay there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone!. We would've left earlier but with the wedding and all,  we decided to try to stick it out. . Don't waste your hard earned money and time on this place. . We are simple people from Oklahoma and don't feel like we are entitled to special treatment but we've had better service at a holiday inn than we got at the stratosphere!
