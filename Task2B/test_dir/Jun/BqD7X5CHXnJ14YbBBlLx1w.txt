Our overall experience was very solid at Julian Serrano - We were inb/w meals & pool time and stumbled upon this place in a great moment of serendipity. The ambiance was surprisingly good for being so close to the heart of the casino.  The service was terrific! . . The cured olive dish was meh but everything else was more or less requisite.  Huge props for having a killer wine list and perfect glass-pours like Txakolina & Albarino to accompany the cuisine: very savvy!. . We loved the kale salad with rainbow baby carrots, heirloom baby tomatoes, red beet gelee in red beet vinaigrette was fresh, rustic & overall very satisfying.. . I thought the mediterranean bass with donostiarra sauce, tomato confit, arbol chili & garlic was expertly prepared, was full-flavored and had great texture & portion size was perfect.  Definitely one of the best fish dishes I've had in a long time.  . . Props... what happens in Vegas ends up on yelp?
Dinner was fine. Service was the worst possible. They seated us in a tight area and the servers kept bumping our chairs. I requested the first server to walk around if possible and he kindly obliged. half hour later and a second waiter bumped me. I requested him to now walk around as well if possible. And he doesn't say anything. He comes back 2 minutes later and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to get by again. I ask him to come over and he ignores me.  Then he starts getting loud and says I'm going to call the manager. Was really not sure what he was threatening me with. Manager comes over, realizes that we have already paid our bill, quickly apologizes and then walks away. The worst service ever in an unnecessarily pricey restaurant. Couldn't figure out how to do zero stars.
I have always been a fan of Firefly and Jaleo, but will never go back after diving at Julian Serrano. Price is comparable to Jaleo buy portions are twice the size. My gf and I had 5 tapas,  cheese and charcuterie boards, and  3 martins. After gratuity and tax the meal was $150. Not bad at all. I was so full. Staff was attentive and prompt. No complaints. I'll be going back.
This is a really fun Spanish Tapas style restaurant. It has slight influences from the micro gastronomy movement. Just try the avocado canneloni, seafood ceviche, lobster gazpacho, huevos estrellados, and you will realize for yourself that this place is not hard to love. This being Vegas, the restaurant has really glamorous decor with mosaic tiled bathroom being a highlight.
The food was so yummy!!! Loved the Oxtail and white fish ceviche. Did not like the fried chicken... We also had a pitcher of Sangria... Tasted amazing too... It's on the pricer side but def worth it. The ambience is so great and the waiters are friendly.
my fav restuarant..i eat there at list once a week and i love it!
4 for the food.  2 for the service.  . Gipsy kings cliche.  White ceviche very good.  Patatas bravas tomato & potato good, the 1/2 cup of aioli (mayonnaise) was nasty - unless you love eating spoonfuls of mayo I would suggest having it on the side.  Chorizo bites recommended.  Chocolate molten cake very good but found the accompanying sorbet a strange match, wouldn't be my first choice.  Quite loud.  Comfy seating.  Amateur, distracted, condescending service, too many tables, flustered saying be right back and then would get sidetracked.  Did not know about comp program, and seemed pissed we were asking about it .  Food came out very quickly, within minutes.. Would try again hoping for better service.
I went there for my bday dinner and I CANNOT tell you how good everything was! The Pan Manchego was insane!!! Just order it, you will not be sorry. My favorite was the beet and manchego tapas plate that came on skewers and tasted out of this world! I loved the presentation and was so surprised that the cheese was melted on the inside but the breading on the outside was perfectly cooked...incredible!
Went for lunch today with high expectations and was not disappointed.  Three of us had tapas and they were all very tasty and the staff was great.  . . In order of preference, we tried. -- Tuna raspberry skewer.  This dish is in all the promotional material for the restaurant and that actually made me concerned it was just hype, but it was great.  Tuna was perfect, and even the raspberry had a unique flavor.. . --  Dates stuffed with pancetta, goat cheese and tomato marmalade.  Great combination of flavors.. . --  Seared scallops.  Scallops were done perfectly and presentation was beautiful.. . --  Grilled NY steak with Japanese eggplant.  The eggplant made the dish.. . --  Baby back ribs.  The weakest of the dishes, solid ribs but nothing special.
Omg! THE BEST tapas restaurant I've ever been to in my life! Period. Def miss it since I'm eastcoasting but will go everytime we stay at the Aria!
Shady continued his trek across Aria eateries stopping by Serrano for round 2 of four in one evening. As should be noted in his reviews, Shady has had an affection for the spanish/tapas style eateries as of late. The choices here for Shady and EXTREMELY lucky guest for the evening as we sat at the bar were the short rib tapas as well as the mixed seafood ceviche. Short ribs were like butter and are a typical Shady go-to and they did not disappoint. The ceviche was good as well, but a touch lacking. Maybe the "mixed" seafood just blended all the flavors together but it seemingly lacked a punch. Nonetheless, Shady and Co. stepped out for round 3 of the night-Sirio
Despite a lot of large parties from the convention that was going on, we were seated right away with no wait. I was quite impressed. It's my favorite place to eat. The ambiance is interesting since it's somewhat open to the lobby at Aria.. . Our server didn't seem too happy when he was taking our order and when we asked him questions about the menu or if we needed anything, his answers were all very curt.. . However, the food is delicious. Since it's all small portions, it's easy to try different things from the menu and also portion things out depending on how hungry you are. I had the traditional spanish chicken croquetas which were so good. Perfectly breaded and crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. The Spanish Iberico Sliders were also amazing. The combination of iberian pork with the ground beef was perfect and complimented each other really well. Too bad there were only two in an order because I wanted more. My friends ordered the lobster salad, grilled flat iron steak, and the fried calamari which they all enjoyed.. . Despite the service not being so great and a little slow, I'm still gonna give Julian Serrano five stars. The server was probably just having an off day. He was nice enough to split our checks three ways which was much appreciated since it made paying a lot easier for us. The food is always delicious and I will definitely go back again.
good tapas place! . service is..okay.. depends on the server I guess, but food is great. . Since portions are small, you can try different kinds of dishes.. I usually get about 8-9 plates for 3 people, but don't expect to be full!. A party of 2, 3, or 4 is good. No more than 4...
This restaurant ranks up there with some Tapas I had in San Diego. Service was prompt and food was flavorful. We hadsangria, gambas, lobster, calamari, charcuterie, and potatoes. It was all warm and fresh and full of flavor. The gambas and potatoes were a little spicy. The calamari was fresh and toasty. The charcuterie was great except no cheese is included or bread. I went back a second time because I liked the gambas so much.  Also Had bonless chicken wings with garlic wrapped in toasted bread topped with spinach and red peppers the best. Also spanish egg tortilla. And ceviche was very fresh. Loved decor and service. Very unique tastings and paella offerings.It is  a little pricey but you are paying for quality food. Definitely highly recommended if you are into Tapas.
Fantastic food! Questionable other aspects: the server was less than attentive, annoyed when I asked him to come back after I had to look at the wine list again after my chosen wine was unavailable and finally... the 'sticky' chairs (which we found out later was actually paint because they touched them up before dinner service). . . With all of that said, the food was tremendous and there was a lot of great and unique items to choose from.
I am from Spain and I am a foodie.   This place rocks.  Six stars out of five.  Better than sex (almost).  I would write details, but I gotta get back to the food.
Chose this restaurant because of the reviews online and by the number of people in the restaurant at 9:30 thought we made a good choice but unfortunately, found the food to be just ok.  It was odd but everything was kind of bland.  Maybe we didn't have enough to drink or maybe it was because my body thought it was 12:30 but we didn't enjoy it as much as others seemed to be enjoying it.  We had a broad selection of menu items, 6 if i recall so should have found one to impress us but alas, did not.
The food was great, the service was wonderful as our server Donovan really took care of us. . . Our only issue was the rude hostess at the front. Upon arrival we were only given the option of sitting at the bar. After questioning the hostess we realized that if we waited 10 minutes, tables would be available. Really weird situation. Not welcoming at all. . . Hostess should be retrained or even fired. If management is reading this, it was the women of Asian decent on 06/23/2014 at around 8:20 pm working the hostess desk at the front.
3 stars for the food. 1 star for the service. . . Food was not bad. Not as good as it was 2 years ago. Lamb chops were ordered medium arrived closer to well done.  Soups were served at room temperature.. . food arrives all at once, and the waiters make no attempt to clear a spot on your table. They stand around expecting you to move food around and move dishes for them.. . Plates used are also ridiculously large for tapas.  3 plates and your table is overwhelmed.. . don't get me wrong everyone was courteous and friendly but I didn't come here to be smiled at and make friends.  . . Used to be a standout Vegas restaurant, now it's just another aging Vegas hasbeen.
Wow. Delicious creative menu. Every dish is top quality.  About as good as it gets in this space. Will absolutely, definitely return. . . Recommend: tuna cones, yellowtail tiradito.
Great food and service. We got tapas y paella and It was delicious. It was a litlle bit noisy but the food worth it. 100% recommended.
Came here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed but we got a table immediately. We ordered a variety of dishes and we asked for recommendations first. Our food came out real quick but the table next to us, who got there before us, wasn't having such good luck. . . Cod on asparagus- bland. . Bone marrow-delicious, tender. . Beef and cheese- beef was a little chewy, I didn't like the taste of the beef and cheese together, tasted alittle gamey. . Duck confit- the duck and sweet potatoes complimented each other quite well. . Salmon truffle -the salmon in the truffle sauce was delicious. . I would definitely come back and try different dishes, they have alot of options on their menu.
My favorite Resturant in Las Vegas . Food is amazing!! Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Askfor Robert for a wine recommendation he's the best!!
It wasn't too busy for a Monday night, made reservations ahead of time so we were seated within seconds. Service was good although the waiter seemed as if he were just being nice because it was his job so that was a turn off. The good was excellent! From the seafood tapas to the vegetarian to the meat, everything was cooked to perfection. The churro dessert is also amazing. You honestly can't go wrong with anything that you order.
