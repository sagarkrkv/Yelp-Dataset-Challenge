Sushi House Goyemon is the BEST All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi place my wife and I have EVER BEEN TO. We miss it sooooo much now that we are living in the Bay Area.. . We used to live about 10 minutes away from Goyemon, and we used to go about once every couple of weeks for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). There are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri, 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp), 3) you can order ramen after 11. Other than these three things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch.. . Our typical order when we go for dinner includes the following items: . 1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe). 2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna. 3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon, ramen (after 11pm). 4) grilled dishes - grilled pork belly, grilled super white tuna, grilled cajun salmon. 5) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brulee. . That order listed above might sound like a lot, but trust me, it's worth it. And you have to try these items. There is a reason why we kept coming back week after week, and why this is the first place we want to go eat when we visit Las Vegas. It's also why this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about this place is that the wait can be very, very long. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take 1-2 hours to get seated. They have a couple other restaurants owned by the same group - the other 2 restaurants are called Sushi Mon... both are just as good, and soon to be reviewed by me as well. . . If you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Goyemon or Sushi Mon. Ok? Cool, thanks!
Came in for lunch on a hot weekday. I'm not a big fan of AYCE sushi but Sushi House Goyemon also offers lunch specials. Parking was easy to locate. I arrived after the lunch hour began and the place was near capacity for lunch.. . I opted for the lunch sashimi special which was reasonably priced and included miso soup, rice and salad. The quality of sashimi was unfortunately A-ok with the exception of the salmon which was the tastiest and ended my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream. . . Another con was the spotty service - I had to flag down the waitress for assistance and also request dessert! Not sure if they were having a off day here but I probably wouldn't return here again.
Food is great and I love the all you can eat deal!!! Excellent quality for a good price!!!
AYCE option is a no brainer, the choices are amazing and they bring the food quick, no waiting around here. There were so many great dishes, I'll try to list it from memory:. . salmon. albacore. yellowtail. surf clam. salmon skin handroll. ebi. uni. fried shrimp heads. pork belly. . I'm sure I missed a lot of items, but these are the ones that standout the most. Gotta order the fried shrimp heads & pork belly, absolutely fantastic.
AYCE Lunch: 11:45am - 4pm $21.95 per person (time limit 45 minutes) note: uni and ama ebi not available.. AYCE Dinner: 4pm - 3am $26.95 per person (time limit 60 minutes).. . We ordered 2 adult AYCE lunches. Lunch Total With a coke and Tax: $49.35 (not including tip).. . Taste: 3 stars - They are only on the radar by a mere passing grade. Nothing was memorable or great. Everything was either average or not good at all. Even in the beginning of our lunch, we refused to eat one of the rolls we ordered, since it tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste in our mouth. The fish to rice ratio was less than average - the fish cuts were short and thin with a dense ball of rice. In the world of AYCE, Sakana wins the match - they offer a waaaaay better fish to rice ratio, better selection, and more explosive flavors. . . . The good:. 1. Salmon nigiri - slim cuts of salmon, but it will do. The fish tasted sweet and fresh. . 2. Halibut nigiri - it wasn't bad, the fish tasted fresh and had a nice texture. 3. Yellowtail nigiri - also a sweet and fresh tasting fish. 4. Magma roll (half roll/ 4pcs) - we enjoyed this roll. It was simple, but all of the flavors and the texture went together nicely. . 5. Miso Soup - we loved how it came out piping hot. It wasn't too salty which is a plus in my book. . 6. Lemon roll (half roll/ 4pcs) - it was simple, light and refreshing. Be careful with the lemon slices, some of them were sliced too thick and left a overwhelmingly bitter taste. You might need to just squeeze the lemon.. 7. Green tea ice cream - very creamy and had a light green tea flavor. We loved how it wasn't overly sweet. . 8. The stamp card- I love the idea, it might be the only thing that could bring me back. . . The bad: . 1. Tuna poke - only 4 small bits of tuna cubes! it was really bad. I only tasted salty soy sauce and nothing else. . 2. Baked green mussels (2 pcs) - it's just a lot of sweet mayo, nothing special . 3. Takoyaki - it's all dough! There was a tiny dot of octopus in each one. . 4. Sunshine/Or sunrise roll? It was horrible! The sauce they used tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste. We couldn't eat it. My boyfriend felt sick after he ate that roll.. 5. Strawberry mochi - they used some knock off mochi brand and it tasted like fake bubblegum. It wasn't good.. . Value: 3 stars - It's a little less than average. It's a lot pricier compared to Naka Sushi. The fish was fresh, but definitely thin baby cuts or not consistent. Also their AYCE menu selection is noticeably smaller than that of other places. It seems like they focus on rolls here. Their side dishes (appetizer) selection is very slim and basic compared to Naka Sushi or Sakana's selection. . . Service: 2 stars - The hostess was very cheerful and energetic. However, our waitress seemed like she was over her job and like she was dragging her feet. She seemed annoyed that we wanted to order more food. Many times she would disappear into the back and we would not see anyone on the floor for a while. On a good note, it didn't seem like we were on a timer at all for the 45 minute lunch and we didn't feel pressured. . . Would we eat here again? I doubt it. Only if we're in the immediate area and wanted a later lunch that ends at 4pm. Other than that, we preferred Naka sushi's value and selection and my personal favorite Sakana takes the crown in selection, flavor, and quality!
This is the place for you if you want a bunch of zombies and depressed people serving you food.  Seriously, the sushi chefs are so miserable.  They don't smile, they don't acknowledge that they've heard your order either.  It used to be fun sitting at the bar, but now it's so depressing.  Sitting at a table is a terrible idea too since service is so slow and the servers screw up your order all the time.  We've been frequenting Goyemon for years and it has progressively gone down hill.  I feel it's finally time to say something. . . The freshness of the food has stayed relatively consistent.  One thing I must mention, and there is probably a direct correlation to the sushi chefs, is the quality of the rolls.  They look like a 2 year old made them.  Sloppy, ingredients falling out, rolls falling apart.  I can't even pick up a roll without it falling apart.  Sometimes way too much sauce and sometimes no sauce at all.  This situation is not just a one time "off day".  It's been at least three times.   Mayhaps it's time for you to find a different AYCE sushi place.  Unless mgmt does something about this issue.  We've been to JJanga to get our AYCE fix recently and not only is it fresh, but everybody is so nice and the rolls actually look and taste like a sushi chef made them instead of a 2 year old.
a coworker recommended this place, thank you. What a fantastic place. I probably spent this much easy at the sushi places in Ohio and had much less. I will be back and bring any friends that visit who enjoy sushi.
This place really doesn't need another 5-star review... I think you get the hint. Starting off with the good stuff, what to order:. . -UNI!!!! . -Garlic Edamame to whet the palate . -seaweed salad (I mean, don't you get this pretty much everywhere you go?). -Cajun Albacore. -Garlic Tuna. -Yum Yum Scallop. -Yebisu Roll (super light & fresh) . -Ecstasy Roll. -No Name Roll . -OID Roll. -Sexy Girl . -Hurricane. -Athena . -Stacy. -Rock n Roll. -Green Tea Creme Brulee. . You can order half rolls here, I would advise that you do so. Food comes out SUPER quick, I felt like we had half of our rolls on the table before we even finished giving them the order!. Place is always slammed, so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. . A bit nicer atmosphere-wise than most sushi places I've visited in Vegas, so that's great!. Honestly, my favorite sushi spot in Vegas! GET IT.
AYCE sushi,. . I am a big fan of  AYCE  Sushi and have tried all of the AYCE in Vegas...... . I had high hopes for this place, my friends rave about it, but its okay..... . Pros:   Kool little sushi place, atmophere is kool, alot of young people, good service staff, there rolls are good...... . The bad: They haveno japanese staff (which may indicate lack of authentic sushi) There nigiri is cut in a weird unprofessional way, the fish is not always fresh, there wasibi is not always fresh, there ginger is not always fresh......freshness is a problem. . If they fix the above this place could be a 4 or 5 star..... . Fish freshness is a problem..... . There miso sucks.....there rolls are good..... . Kaya is still king, until I try Umiya.....but thats not saying much...I'm thinking of switiching back to just eating sushi vs AYCE...
This place is a true unexpected gem in Las Vegas. We were in the mood for sushi but didn't want to go to a high-priced place on The Strip so we found ourselves here. Upon arriving in the strip mall parking lot, the place is very unassuming, even dive-ish from the outside. The inside is actually quite nicely decorated in a simple yet well-appointed Japanese style. . . Now on to the good stuff.... . We ordered the All You Can Eat Lunch for $26.95/ pp. You really can't go wrong here. Order from the whole menu and the only restriction is the time limit of 45 minutes. Between the 2 of us we ordered 7 different rolls, soup, edamame, soft drinks and dessert - all included. I was stuffed when we left, to say the least!! . . For the quality and selection of the sushi this is an amazing deal!!! Although everything we had was delicious, the stand outs were the Spider, Orion, and Tiger rolls. . . When I'm in Las Vegas again in the future, this will be on my places to visit again.
Goyemon, hands down the best AYCE sushi ever!. . Prepare yourself... the waits long, but its worth it!. . They have daily specials on the chalk board. It gets cramped when you're waiting but otherwise, being a sushi snob this is the only place I like to go to when I want AYCE.. . Their side dishes aside from their sushi are pretty yummy. . . If you're into that kinda weird food stuff, NATTO CUT ROLL!! But my favorite specials have to be salmon belly and conch without the sauce... MMM thinking about it makes me want sushi now!
Sushi House Goyemon.....oh how i love that i found you.. . This place is a true gem..and for the very first time; i experienced locals.. . You know what they say.. if a place is packed with locals.. then it must be really good.. . AYCE Sushi --could be a hit or miss.. but this place is for sure a real hit.. . The place is Completely OFF the strip. Like..it's a $20 worth cab ride from the Trump..and a $15 worth cab ride back to the Excalibur.... . So... if you have a car.. Definitely worth it to drive to this place for the cheap deal for AYCE but if you are...say two people sharing a cab.. then might as well splurge your money at the strip (not the taxi cab fare). get what am sayin?. . Anyway... The fish is fresh.. all the rawness goodness is legit.. . Loved the small tapas plates... . But i especially loved the hamachi and the salmon sashimi. the Salmon Belly was out of this world good as well.. . Their special of the day was the Uni. Not sure i liked that.. it had an aftertaste that's not present in really good Unis i've had before.... . We got our money's worth for everything.. including our cab fare.. . Fast and Great service. No wait.
Great place for all you can eat sushi. Call ahead and ask for the wait time. This place gets packed very quick !!!!!
Sushi was awesome!! Interesting enough it was like sushimon which I also love. Awesome cajon albacore tuna. And 911 roll was actually spicy!!! Recommend you go for the all you can eat and enjoy a lot of the menu.
Jessie B. and I had decided to go to lunch by where she worked. When she suggested sushi I was all in. . . Goyemon was so much fun. We ended up snagging the last two seats at the sushi bar. (Score) They even have convenient purse hooks under the bar. We both ordered the AYCE lunch ($21.95). They have a huge menu. Jessie luckily had been her before so she ordered some of her favs and I picked some that sounded tasty to me. I really enjoyed the fact you could order half rolls. It really gives you an opportunity to try lots of different rolls. Some of my favorites were the Sexy Girl, Lemon Roll, Pixie Roll and the scallops. I could go on forever, 'cause the truth is everything was good. . . The chefs and staff were very attentive and never let my water glass get empty. They also thanked us several times for coming in. . . I can not wait to go back again. I've been dreaming about it ever since! Mmmmm Goyemon!
Best All you can eat in Vegas! If you haven't tried it you should. Usually go to Oyshi quality is not that good anymore. This place is great nice clean and friendly!
Most of the food was good, but overall experience got the 2 stars. To start waitress was very unfriendly, barely even cracked a smile. My friend had a hair rolled up in her roll so when they cut it there was a piece of hair in every section, yuck! When we finished our all you can eat we had maybe 3-4 pieces left in a group of 6 and they said we had to eat the rest or we would be charged for each plate. Then after we ate we were promptly kicked out due to a time frame, ahhh, there are six of us, not everyone shovels food down their mouth. Would never return again.
Best AYCE sushi in town! Also, the lunch price you can order everything that's available for dinner.. The only thing is you have 45 mins instead of 1 hr!
Loved this place.  Visiting from out of town, and this was recommended.  Highly suggest sitting at the counter, especially if you can sit with Ivan.  He's awesome...makes suggestions and gets creative based on your preferences.  Definitely will be back!
I have to admit that I only had 2 real meals this weekend because of EDC, but I was glad Goyemon was one of them. My friend from Vegas strongly recommended forme to try this place before heading back to LA. We came in at around 5pm (group of 5) on a Monday night and the wait was around 20 minutes (not too bad compared to the other reviews). The restaurant was pretty small, but the service was relatively quick and accommodating. There's an hour limit on AYCE dinner. We went on an order rampage immediately, focusing mostly on the nigiri. The rice:fish ratio was a bit off for me (too much rice) but it wasn't too overwhelming.. . Onto the fish. I personally ordered a sashimi salad, which was delicious and refreshing. For the nigiri, I tried the tuna, salmon belly (GREAT), octopus, uni (limit 1 order/person), sweet shrimp (GOOD; limit 1 order/person), yellowtail (YES), super white tuna, snow crab hand roll (too much rice), scallops and unagi (always my favorite). The fish was fresh and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth (turned out to be around $32/person). There were a lot of special rolls that looked great as well. My friends liked the rainbow roll, but not the spider roll. They also enjoyed the salmon, salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, sashimi salad, edamame (garlic buttered) and miso group. Goyemon offers a bunch of dessert, ranging from green tea or red bean ice cream to vanilla or strawberry mochi. I thought it was nothing special, but was pleasantly surprised by the numerous options.. . All in all, for the same price, I prefer this over a Vegas buffet any day. The AYCE option for lunch looks a lot more worth it in comparison to dinner, so I'll probably be back for that if I'm ever in the area!
what is wrong with the server here name:MARIA. our server was okay. she got busy so we didn't get anything or nobody would come near to our table. literally nobody would look at our table. so my bf looked to see anybody could get the order for us. so he raised his hand. . MARIA was taking care of the next table of 6ppl. she came between the table and was taking order from the big party. so she saw my bf raising his hand. so she said "ill get your order" and SHOOK HER HEAD when she said it, face expressions 'annoyed'.  what the hell? she can do that at the back but doing that shit in front was super rude. We both saw it and at first i thought i saw it wrong . but yes, my bf saw it too. . BOSS at Goyemon should read this. I worked as a server for couple years and i understand customers can get annoyed but u dont want to express that in front of the customers!!!!!! isnt that obvious?  thats so rude!!! . I did not tip anything. Its my first time ever do that. I feel sorry for the other servers but they should know the reasons too. MARIA, put yourself in my shoes and u should know how furious we are right now.
AYCE is the way to go! Excellent sushi. The fish is so fresh and everything is portioned right. gives you the chance to try many different dishes. I can compare this place to many high end sushi restaurants but for half the price! I have finally found my vegas sushi joint!
The all you can eat menu has a great selection of sushi, nigiri, appetizers and dessert. Our server was very attentive and continuously brought out everything we asked for. The sushi and nigiri were very fresh and for dessert we had the mochi and green tea creme brulee which were also delicious. We had a table of 8 people. We had a reservation and were started within 10 minutes.
