FEZ is a gem that I drove by constantly but never really knew what it was. One weekend my wife and I decided to spend a few days at the Clarendon Hotel and we walked to FEZ. Great food, great service, wish I would have stopped sooner!
Fez has been on my list of places to try for some time now and I guess I could've waited a little longer. I will say, the service was great and our server was very attentive. The food fell short of my expectations. I had the lamb sliders for dinner and I just found the meal to be lacking seasoning and flavor for lamb. Would have to say that Fez Fizzed!
Martini Tuesday at FEZ is my new favorite thing to do on my day off! My pasta was wonderful! Everything here is great. Great service, great music (at a reasonable volume), great food, great drinks! I'm so happy right now! Thanks FEZ
I love the flavor combinations on all their food. Great food, conistent quality... Can be loud and busy in the evenings but great food for sure.
Try the pizzas and the fries. AMAZING!!! And they must have the BEST black bean burger in town. Substitute on any of their burger choices.
great crowd, outdoor seating and casual food.
i love the flatbreads, salads and drinks at this place. the atmosphere and service is great.  I enjoy coming here in the evening or on a weekend afternoon.
One of my favorite Phoenix restaurants.. Today I enjoyed lunch with my extended family. Monica / Monique? answered the phone when I called to make a reservation. She asked great questions about the specific needs of my party & when I arrived she had our perfect table, accommodating my elderly parents who couldn't sit at a high top table, and my mother who has a severe hearing problem. We started out great!. We ordered the twin hummus appetizer - yum! with veggie slices. Off the charts deliciousness. Huge portion.. I ordered a hamburger ( 1st one listed on the menu)  fabulous. A huge portion.. My daughters ordered the berry cashew salad and the apple pear salad with chicken. My parents shared a hamburger. Everyone loved their food. Our waiter was Joey - attentive, fun, offered great suggestions. I loved the pomegranate margarita - Joey's suggestion. . I highly recommend Fez. And if you go in cooler weather, sit outside on their screened in patio.
I wanted to like this place, but the food wasn't very good. Don't come here if you are a vegetarian.
This place is Freaking Fantastic ! One of my favorite restaurants!. We use to have girls night here with my AZ girlfriends every couple of months.. . I can't wait to come back to town and have a fez burger. Might be the best gourmet burger Ive ever had ! Also love the chicken ceaser with pistachio and the bruschetta appetizer *commence drooling. . Cocktails here are wonderful as well : )
The Fez Burger is probably the best burger I've ever had! Every time I go I order the burger :)
It's been about a couple years since I've been but when I did was delicious!
This place was ok. Food was alright. Staff was alright. Prices a bit high. It seems more hype than its worth.
Definitely worth a visit, just went and very much enjoyed my all American burger. It came out a little rare at first but after sending it back it returned perfect! So thankful the chef wasn't offended and genuinely wanted to give me a meal to my satisfaction!
