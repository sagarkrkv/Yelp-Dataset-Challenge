Excellent roast pork slices.  The broth and noodles were good.  Service and atmosphere was what you'd expect from a popular noodle house: packed but efficient.
Taste: 3. Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5. Atmosphere: 2.5. Service: 4. Bang for your buck: 4. . I LOVE RAMEN, ive gone to japan for one day just to eat at my favorite ramen spot, so when i was told that vegas has some of the best ramen i had to hop on the next flight and try this place out. Lets start with atmosphere, located in china town in a small shopping mall and if your dropped off by a cab good luck trying to get another one unless you call (TIP) The place is small and well its packed all the time i go at least so get here early or try an off night. The inside is exactly how it is in japan SMALL and casual so taking a date here on your first date wouldnt be ideal but you can try raku next door. Now to the good part FOOD, i love the noodles here cooked perfectly not chewy and over cooked like a lot of ramen places (note: ramen is all about the noodles so i give the noodles alone 4 stars) down to the broth which was well a little too salty not a bad broth but def overpowered the noodles and chasu so i had to deduct points. Service here is well my experience was great, server sat us fast and got our order perfect, and key point kept my WATER full which is my biggest thing at any  restaurant; why you ask because its the easiest thing to do and well most places fuck up and thats how i determine tip as well (TIP) Overall this is the ramen spot to go to in vegas so far until something else pops up but however this is still not the best well at least in vegas it is thank you Monta i will return!
Best ramen in Vegas, hands down.  I have tried other ramen shops but I always find myself back here.  Monta has delicious broth and great noodles.  I like the wavy thick noodles that is offered in the miso ramen and shoyu ramen.  The thin straight noodles are good too but I like the thick kind.  You can choose from Tonkatsu (pork), Shoyu, Tonkatsu-Shoyu, or Miso broth.  You can make any broth spicy.  There is also a new broth that is the Tonkatsu broth with black garlic oil.  Sounds yummy.  The broths are all great and there are yummy add-ins.  I always add corn.  If you are feeling extra indulgent add some butter!  I like to wear a dark colored shirt so that you can't see all of the splash marks from the soup. . . The sides are good to start off with.  The fried rice is actually pretty amazing.  The chunks of meat in the fried rice are delicious.  Gyoza is always a safe bet too.. . Expect to wait.  That is the only reason I am not here more often.  I hate waiting to eat.  This restaurant is tiny and there are a lot of Monta fans out there.  You can try their other location Monta Chaya in Henderson if you are closer to that side of town.  Haven't been myself but it's owned by the same people. . . Happy Ramen-ing :D
My favorite noodle place in Vegas so far.. . I had the Miso Ramen. Make sure you ask for butter and corn in your order. I tried the egg in it and was not a fan. If you ask for green onion be prepared for a lot of green onion.. . This is not a big place. We did not wait but it was mid afternoon on a Sunday. Most of the time there is a line.
This place is great. Fast past environment with some of the best ramen in town. I recommend getting the karrage followed with your choice of ramen. No desserts here. This place also gets super busy, best to get there early or before they close for a chance to get best seating.
Their ramen really hit the spot after a weekend of TOO much fun. It's a really small store so you might have to wait. There's a bar that you can sit at which is also really crowded. My friend got the pork bowl and it tasted too fatty for me. . . One star off because I felt sick after from all the msg. But that's just me. If you don't mind msg, it'll be 5 stars for sure.
Yummmmers......I haven't had this good of ramen since my visit to Japan last year... atmosphere, friendly employees, not to mention! Awesome price for such a delightful bowl of ramen! Note... for extras; the boiled egg and/or corn is a must! Extra tenderloin or charsu if you're a meat lover!
My favorite ramen spot her in Vegas. Their slow roasted pork is the best. Nice atmosphere. Great tasting food. Filling. Easy on the wallet.
The fried rice is my favorite,  made with fried pork belly. How can you go wrong?  Actually, it is tied with the miso ramen.  I have been wanting to try the new ramen with black garlic oil but I just love my favorites so much I can't bear not ordering them.  Whenever im in Vegas I HAVE to eat here and now im a regular here even though my home is 2500 miles away.  That's how great this place is.
Oh Monta..a place I can go to escape the craziness of Las Vegas and enjoy the delicious simplicity of ramen.  . . You can count on the place being busy.  Not the ideal place for big parties.  . . The broth is superb.  I usually have the cha-shu with an egg.  Perfect hangover cure.  . . When in Rome, eat Monta,
I came here as a result of Yelp reviews. Totally worth it. I had the Tonkotsu ramen. So rich and creamy! Like savory, meat flavored buttery broth! I was worried that I would have a belly ache because it was so rich, but no, I was just fine! I didn't have any add-ins and I was so full! . . My daughter had just had her wisdom teeth out a few days prior and was dying for some real food. She had the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. By the time she was done, she looked like a whole new person. When she walked in, she was pale and tired, her eyes were glassy. By the time she was done eating her ramen, she had a rosy glow in her cheeks and she perked up 100%! It was like ambrosia. . . We loved this place so much that when my friend came to visit from the San Francisco Bay Area the next day, we went again. My friend is a food snob and was leery that Monta would be anywhere near as good as her beloved Orenchi in Santa Clara (I've eaten there, it is heavenly). Monta definitely passed her high standards. I couldn't get her to admit that Monta was better, but she did agree that it was at least equal!. . Very friendly and attentive staff. Small eating area, but just make sure you come before or after the normal busy times. We didn't have a wait either time when we went around 6:30pm, but worth the wait if you have to. . . If you are looking for a good ramen place, this is it! If you think ramen comes in a package with a seasoning packet, go here and prepare to be schooled. SO ONO!
I read the term "complex tasting broth" in a review for another ramen place and I never got the term till I tried the tonkotsu shoyu ramen here. Best ramen ever! The fried rice is pretty good to but the gyoza is nothing to rave about.
despite the cold or hot weather that vegas gets whenever we are in vegas this place is a MUST on our list now! We stumbled upon this amazing place through yelp since we are from San Diego and we were unfamiliar with the area we usually mainly stay on the stripe when were in vegas but today was different we wanted to get away from the crazy scene and do something else and boy am I glad we did! . . We came during a weird time around 230/300 so the place was pretty empty but I'm sure during lunch and dinner they are packed considering they only have a handful of tables. When you enter you instantly smell the delicious broth. We were welcomed and seated instantly. When we looked at the menu I was surprised to see that the. Menu was small! It only had about 4 entrees and half Of them were ramen with the other half side dishes so instantly I knew that this place was going to be delicious since they only specialized on one type of dish! i got the miso ramen while my fiance got the tonkatsu (did I spell that right? Lol) ramen. Both were delicious it's ridiculous how much flavor the broth had! Hands down the best ramen place that I have tried so far! . . As for service I have no complaints either everyone was friendly and greeted us when we entered and when we left! Like I said this place is a MUST now for us whenever we are in vegas and I can't wait till I go back again! . . Side note: when we got back to our hotel room after eating here we turned on the food channel and they happened to be on tv! I thought it was a pretty funny coincidence but it just goes to show how yummy this place is! (:
If you're not a fan of sirachi chili sauce then pass on the spicy version of ramen and instead use the condiment chili oil on the table. I prefer korean kochojung to sirachi sauce. Good ramen, good broth! ...
Good Ramen.  You won't regret coming here.  I had a bowl of rich Ramen with pork and a side of Kimchi.  Very good tasting broth.  Service was very friendly and quick.  I'd come back any time.
I love this place... the waiting sucks, the small seating area sucks, but once you sit down and start eating all those sucky parts melt away. You have to order their ramen. This time I got tonkatsu-shoyu - pork/soy sauce..? Extra order of noodles and added 1 egg, 3 extra orders of chashu (I absolutely do not regret this), half order of pork belly, gyoza and fried rice (mustard leaves). I loved everything, the gyoza and pork belly I can live without, but the ramen and chashu and fried rice was pure heaven for me. Regretting that I moved out of Vegas.
During a foodie excursion to Vegas, we wanted to eat something delicious, yet budget-friendly. After pouring over a few years' worth of Vegas Weekly magazines, authentic Japanese ramen at Monta Ramen made the cut. The restaurant was crowded, but we scored seats! We split an order of kuro ramen and kimchi fried rice.  The slurp-worthy broth was full of flavor and quite excellent, and the noodles were chewy and delicious. It was my first time having kimchi fried rice and it was love at first bite. By now, I've probably eaten my weight in fried rice, but Monta Ramen's kimchi variation was kickass. Monta Ramen for the best ramen in Vegas!
come for their RAMEN and make sure when you order you ask for the squiggly noodles, made that mistake today.  I ate the cold noodles two years ago and they def hit the spot on a HOT day in vegas. . . This time I went for the spicy tonkatsu....the flavor was so balanced and then to make it spicy they put some of that korean hot pepper paste that sets it on fire from the inside of the bowl and out.  I cannot wait for Monta to come to Texas!!
I'm not big on ramen but this place is legit. There broths are flavorful, noodles are not over cooked, and there toppings are good too. You know its legit when there's ALWAYS a wait, then again this place is SUPER small. Every time I come here I have to wait at least 30 min but that's okay, its worth it. Prices are fairly average for a bowl of ramen. I'll def be back when i'm back in Vegas. :)
a must try when in vegas they have amazing noodles and their friend rice WOW!! loved it.....will be going again when im in the area
Yeah buddy -- this ain't Top Ramen for those rookies out there.  I've been eating ramen my entire life and made time to check this place out after a long day at a pool on the strip.. . They have great options available for every taste -- hot/cold, meat/veggie.  I had the spicy Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with egg and extra pork.  The kimchee side was perfect.  AlthoughI don't look it, I'm half asian and when I walked up there were asians everywhere so I knew it was probably legit LOL.. . Make time to leave the buffets and tourist traps on the strip and eat here once.  Plan accordingly because you may have to wait to eat since seating is very limited.  My group of three lucked out this day but the people after us had to wait.
My buddy's been raving about Monta Ramen for as long as I can remember. Me, I just can't justify a soup as a meal, so I had never been before today. With only 4 hours of sleep and a 12nhour workday, a bowl of soup sounded like the perfect way to end my day. The spicy miso I ordered was delicious, and I ate every last drop of soup after finishing the noodles. I still will not change my stance of eating ramen as a meal, but if I have a craving for ramen I'm sure I'll come back in to Monta.
I really don't know what the hype is for this ramen place. This is my second time here because I thought I would give this place another try. Perhaps this is the best ramen place in Vegas, but if it is, I feel sad that people who live here haven't truly experienced good ramen. . . The ramen noodles are overcooked and soggy. The broth does not taste like it has been cooked long enough with pork and chicken. If you like the type of broth that is not super thick though, this type of broth might be for you. Flavors seem to be added in after the fact rather than blended in. Something seems off about the whole ramen experience. I give it 2 stars because this place does try and has decent customer service.
After having ramen from the restaurant down the road,  I was quite disappointed in Monte Ramen.  . . It was relatively easy to find...on the right side of Spring Mountain Road as you drive east. The parking lot is shared with other busy restaurants.  I could feel a slight breeze from the air conditioning which was really helpful since it was 100 degrees outside! . . The interior was small and dark. There were 5 tables and 9 counter seats. There were a few chairs for customers to wait for a table. Make sure you get your name on the clipboard! . . The gyoza was shocking. ..it looked pale and undercooked,  like it was just fried on one of its 3 sides.  The inside was bland and flat tasting. . . On the other hand,  the miso broth was really salty and the noodles were too soft. I didn't finish it.  The toppings of green onion, bamboo shoots & black fungus were room temperature as if they were hastily thrown on the top. . . I would only go back if the competition down the road was full and if there was no line.  If there was a line,  go to the other restaurants right next door!  Sorry...
Delicious but they really need to get a bigger place. It's way to small for how slammed they always are.
Their Kuro Ramen was soooo good. The black garlic oil had a nice kick to it. The pork was so soft it melts in your mouth. Wish I had order a triple order of the pork had I known. One ofthe better ramen joints I've had in awhile.
