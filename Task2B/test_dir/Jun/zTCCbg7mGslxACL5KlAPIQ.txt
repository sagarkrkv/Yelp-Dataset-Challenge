Nice variety - good price - abundance of food.. . Some sides/salads are unique in taste like the brussels sprouts salad & the yellow tomato salad.. . The Snow crab legs evidence thawing from frozen (I don't really mind the fact that they were frozen, but I just wish I didn't see/feel it. To avoid this, just get the steamed ones which taste much better anyway!. . The desserts are amazing.. . The servers are below par.
The Aria Buffet is actually REALLY GOOD. They use quality ingredients and the offerings definitely do not suffer from "steam table" syndrome. They also had some curry dishes which were quite tasty. We were there for lunch so the pricing was more relaxed ($26.99) and plenty of choices to keep me busy.. . Service was A+ and right on the ball. We never waited for dishes to be cleared and our beverages always full.. . I am a fan and as Arnold Schwart says, "I'll be back"!
We came here for Saturday Brunch ($29.99). I came in with pretty low expectations from Yelp, but it is one of the few buffets I haven't yet tried on the Strip. Since our weekend was full of trying new things with familiar faces, we all decided to try it out. The wait went by fairly quickly; we came around 12:30pm with a group of 4 and were seated within 15 minutes of when we arrived in line. The place itself is pretty open; it seems updated, but has a fairly simple design. . . Service was pretty great. Our drinks were never empty and our plates were cleared quickly. As for the food, I thought the variety was pretty exceptional. They had tons of seafood (mostly cold, which I wasn't a super fan of)-- crawfish, 2 different types of mussels, crab legs, sushi, smoked salmon, smoked cod, and a bunch of cooked fish. The crawfish was pretty gross but the other cold seafood dishes were decent. I preferred the cooked fish dishes. There was a bread section, a carving section, Mediterranean, Asian (dim sum), charcuterie, Italian, Indian, breakfast foods, salad bar, seafood station, and dessert station (I may be missing a couple here). My favorite part of this buffet was the made-to-order eggs benedict station! You can choose a traditional benedict, a smoked salmon benedict, or a snow crab benedict-- it definitely makes a difference when made fresh! The creme de la creme was the dessert section! I was so full by this time that I was only able to get a scoop of the mint chip gelato from the rotating ice cream display, but the other desserts looked on point. . . I thought the price was well worth it here. This is one of the few buffets in Vegas I wouldn't mind revisiting!
What?! Amazing! Went when The Aria first opened so it's been a while. Quite surprised to see some bad reviews. Gluten free friendly and large selection of food!
Good value and great food.  Smaller buffet than most, but I found it better since it wasn't overwhelming and the options were great!  Lots of seafood.  The brisket was my favorite.  If you want the super large too many options Buffett - This s NOT it.  Its smaller scale yet the options available were HIGH  quality.
This was our first buffet in LV and let me tell you, everything was absolutely WONDERFUL. From the staff to the food, it was all good. Way better than the Bellagio! Must go! THANKS ARIA.
The food was very fresh and appetizing. We were not sure what to expect but were completely satisfied. I especially liked the dim sum options. They had warm and iced crab legs. The pita bread was made right in front of you. They have a huge gelato selection as well as other desserts.
Decent selection but not millions of selections like the more popular ones. I loved the pasta salad which inspired me to recreate that dressing since I loved it so much. That being said I gave it an extra star because I have this one friend who says he could drink that dressing. I think the freshness and the flavors of this buffet were more impressionable than most Vegas buffets. One day I will try the coveted m buffet should the heavens open up and no one is in line.
it turns out the Coke machine was broken but they didn't tell us until we paid $120 and sat.. Waiter said to our table  "well what do you want me to do about it?"  (Gee maybe bring cans?) So, no soda. Very very slow waiter and management response.  Many people were asking for waters still waterless even after they were on their at the second plate from the buffet. Many tables were not bussed during entire meal.. . Poor service marred the otherwise outstanding buffet choices.
This buffet is a little pricey, but so worth it!  The dim sum was good.  The steamed crab legs were very tender and so worth the work.  Sometimes with buffets the desserts look good, but disappoint.  That is not the case here all the desserts we tasted were good!
One of the best buffets been too that catering to the vegan or allergic community . Including variety of Indian dishes and made to order gluten free pizza and gluten free desserts...---really made us happy to feel welcome .. Even The executive chef came out to answer questions.
When I first walked in, I had to wait a few minutes to sit down. I'm sure it was not because it was full but because the lack of efficiency of the staff set up. They either didn't have enough hosts or they don't have a good system.. . The place is very nice, I love the atmosphere and the low tones lighting blends really well with the natural light coming in from the windows, obviously this was in the day time, I came at 9AM to get some breakfast. . . Host was nice and greeted me with a smile, and she asked how I was doing and seemed pretty sincere when she asked me. She sat me at the table and just told me that I can go ahead and help myself, which makes sense... its a buffet.. . As soon as I go to the main area looking for eggs, I asked one of the cooks that serve food in the islands, where I could find the eggs and seemed a little bothered that I asked him.. . He did tell me that if I wanted an omelette it was in one direction but if I wanted just eggs hey were in the opposite direction. But he said it in a way like if I was supposed to know.. . I got my food and sat at the table. The server came asking if I needed anything and she was very nice and smiling all the time. She actually made up for the cool that made me feel bad for asking where the food was at.. . She looked stressed out but regardless she managed to keep a smile. Her name is Alicia. Kudos to her.. . Now let's talk about the food, the meat and potatoes of a restaurant.. . First of all I'm pretty health conscious and always want to make sure to ask a fee questions about he food.. . So I grabbed a bowl of oatmeal, I added raisins and a banana to slice it up and put it in my oatmeal along with eggs.. . First if all, I'm sure the eggs were not cracked there, it was probably egg batter, they didn't look like fresh cracked eggs at all.. I asked the waitress if they had coconut or almond milk which they didn't. I don't like to consume too many dairy products, and specially cow milk.. . Then I asked if the orange juice they had was fresh squeezed and she said that it was all from concentrate. . . So as far as the quality of the food, it was about a 3 star. Of course I only had a small sample of the variety if food thy have available, but just by those 2 things I already know that the quality of food is not in the top of their priority list.. . So here's what I say about my first visit here:. . Atmosphere - 5 Stars. Staff Service - 4 Stars. Food Quality - 3 Stars. Variety of Food - 4 1/2 stars.
Black M-Life membership means free buffet!  So dinner at The Buffet?  Why not!. . If you're expecting to be treated like royalty, get real.  This is a buffet.  Drinks refills will be slow but at least the food quality is great and nothing suffers from being overly-steamed or super frozen.  There's a wide variety of offerings here.  There's mini sub-sections for Chinese food, Indian food, Italian food, and so forth.  They have your standard fare of snow crab legs, Alaskan crab legs, king crab legs, prime ribs, pasta bars, salad bars, fancy desserts, et cetera.  I like how they have sugar-free items and gluten-free items so if you're on a strict diet, you won't be misled.. . I'm not sure if I would have stopped in if it wasn't for the M-Life membership perks but I will say that they make a delicious panna cotta.  Delicious!
Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.
No line at 2p on Saturday, still pricey at $32 but it's aria. They still had breakfast out, which is fine by me because it was just a small section. Dinner and lunch menu items were out to enjoy. Same variety as other nice casinos. Love the music that they play, very adult contemporary. Quick to pick up our dirty plates, I put them on par though in general
Average but I don't consider it the best. If an international buffet serves sushi but no sashimi and charges the guest about 45 USD than somethings wrong. But the service and ambiance makes it an ok place to visit.
