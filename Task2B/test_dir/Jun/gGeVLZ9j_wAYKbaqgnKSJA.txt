I've been to Tao Las Vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals I've ever had. . . I think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. . . First off all, we had incredible service. There were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. His manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of Perrier-Jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. . . Our server (I can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. All in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. It felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. Highlights included:. . - Satay of Chilean sea bass with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. Melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. . . - Spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice. . - Crispy spicy tuna roll with avocado and soy paper - probably the best sushi I've ever tasted. . - Lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour. . In addition to the wonderful food and service, Tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. Bonus is that you get free entry to Tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). . . Would highly recommend Tao for dinner!
Ich berichte uber das Restaurant und nicht uber den Night-Club. Das super Stylische Ambiente ist wirklich einmalig und das Essen steht dem um nichts nach. Gute asiatische Kuche, manchmal nicht allzu authentisch aber dennoch sehr schmackhaft wird hier serviert. . Es kann durchaus etwas lauter werden, was Freude auf de Night Club macht !
This was our first time to Tao.  My wife and I really liked it.  The food was excellent and given that it is clearly a gourmet Asian the portion sizes were just right, the presentation of the food was very artistic and well done.  The atmosphere is very cool and hip with a great vibe going on all night there....we did go to the club afterwards and while the website shows this as a big looking club we actually found it to be a bit cramped an small for the amount of people they let in....unless you get bottle service be prepared to feel like a second class citizen....the security people are somewhat militant as one time I set my drink down to simply put on my blazer and was immediately approached that I was not allowed to set my drink there....a bit ridiculous and extreme IMHO.   We will definitely go back to the restaurant but will skip the club even if it offers free admission with our dining experience as It was not enjoyable.
Went to Tao about two weeks ago on the last day of my Birthday vacay in vegas. And I loved it! There's not one bad thing to say about it. The decor was really nice. Especially when you first walk in, there's these pretty tubs full of rose pedals & lit up with candles. Thought that was a classy touch. And love all the asian style decor everywhere when you get inside. And the food was delicious! I got the Shrimp Pai Thai and it was so yummy and filling. Had to take half home. I'd definitely be back there again when i return to vegas! :)
So if you are thinking family style, you are wrong.  The food wasn't bad. Like any other Asian place. Over priced for the portion. Would not come back. Left hungry. Oh and drinks are $4 and you don't get refills.
I had been to Tao before, but this time was one for the books. We had a reservation and arrived a bit early and we were seated right away. I was with my best friend so we wanted to share a bunch of items on the menu.  The staff was so friendly and they were so attentive to our needs (always filling up our water, asking if we needed anything, etc). I definitely recommend Tao to people visiting Vegas.
We dined with a group of 6 and really looked forward to an amazing experience since I had heard so much about their menu and incredible flavors.  When our waiter arrived he tried to explain their signature dishes as well as his personal favorites.  Everyone basically wanted a tasting menu but a couple of people had specific dietary restrictions.  That said, we all started the first course which came out with 6-7 different dishes which we shared family style.  Actually full at that moment our waiter came out with 3 large platters of rolls and sashimi.  Not knowing what to do we all started to eat it because it was a part of the "tasting menu".  Feeling very uncomfortable and more than full, our waiter said that he was coming with the dessert.  At that time we all said "please don't!"  What was supposed to be a great dining experience turned into the waiter not realizing that the tasting menu should have been changed to accommodate a normal person's appetite.  Seriously it was way too much food for 6 people and probably could have served 12.  Sorry Tao but the 3 stars are for inappropriate ordering for your guests not for flavor which by the way was amazing!!
Good service, great atmosphere and really tasty food. Not as overpriced as Lavo at the Palazzo and a far better experience.  Tony the waiter was a real nice guy. Did a great job.
First of all this is one of our favorite restaurantsin vegas, whether we're just eating dinner or celebrating a special occasion.  Everything on the menu is delicous and the cocktails  hands down are some of the best that I've ever had.  Dont forget to order the giant fortune cookie for dessert, it doesnt dissapoint.
Our first time at Tao Asian Bistro.  We walked through an area with cement bathtubs with floating rose petals.  Really pretty!  I had phoned in my reservation but when I got there, they didn't have my reservation!  Go figure!  Anyway, we got seated promptly.  We ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken, Fried Rice with Kimchee, Red Fried Rice with Pork Belly, Endamame, Lo Mein, & Long Beans.  . . It was just OK.  Not fantastic.  It's bordering on westernized Chinese food.  The presentation of some of the dishes made me wonder why they selected their china that way.  The bowls were huge and on a pedestal and not your usual rice bowl.  Very difficult to eat noodles or rice.  They try to impress that they are using Chinese china in an interesting, splashy way but it doesn't make sense.  Why use a clay pot for long beans when there's hardly any beans in the dish?  You have to really look into the pot to grab the long beans!  . . Decor is very nice.  Big Buddha as the centrepiece.  Dark with very low lighting and candles.  I had to get used to it.  There's a wall of pipes, in their own coloured showcases.  Interesting.
Went here for a bachelorette party and the food was amazing. Our server was really friendly and made great suggestions, we ordered everything he mentioned and we were not disappointed. You must try the spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice appetizer and the Miso glazed chilean sea bass entree.
My sister-in-laws and I came to Vegas for a quick weekend trip. We stopped in TAO for a light dinner and some drinks. We sat at the bar. It was awesome!!! Toni who works behind the bar is amazing!! She walked us the the menu and gave us her suggestions. She did not steer us wrong; it was all delicious! The dim sum is incredible! The dessert was perfect! The best part was the drinks. Toni made me a delicious mojito! My sister-in-law got the lycee martini and it was perfect! If you come to Vegas and stay near the Palazzo/Venitian, you have to come to TAO and find Toni at the bar!! Would absolutely come back.
