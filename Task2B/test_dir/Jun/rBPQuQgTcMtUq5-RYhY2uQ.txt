Best food ever. We too took advantage of the Groupon deal which made it sweeter yet. We alway eat at Le Buffet when in Vegas
Slow service, rude hostess and cold food. What's the point when you have so many options?
solid four and a half. Good food, great service. The crab was super fresh and I likes the offerings and desert. I would have this as my top seven buffets in Vegas!
My husband and I went to gorge ourselves on seafood, duck l'orange, and french pastries. The food was very good: sushi, crab legs, yummy cold seafood and salads. Crepes. Macarons. Cheese. Pate'. Duck l'orange. Great vegetables. . . Minus one star for the all-you-can-drink portion. The wine was nasty -- sweet like Livingston or a comparable brand (which I wish I didn't even know, but sadly I do.). . Just do all-you-can-eat and drink somewhere else for the money the all-you-can-drink costs.
My friends and I woke up late for breakfast and decided to head over to Paris for brunch.  I did not stay in Paris so I can't review the hotel but as I walked through the hotel to the buffet I got a glimpse of it and it was so cute. They have little patisseries and French signs all over to make it feel authentic. The line for the buffet was quite long but moved surprisingly quickly. I was adamant about eating a crepe for breakfast so I refused to leave. What I really liked about this buffet in particular is they do not take a break from breakfast to lunch or dinner they just gradually change the dishes so I got to sample the breakfast and lunch buffet. The food was soooooo good. I had this amazing steak and potato has with real chunks of tender beef, smoked salmon, something that resempled scalloped potatoes without the cheese but lots of sauteed onions and mussels. They have stations that represent the different regions in france which I thought was a good idea and helps break stereotypes. I have no complaints about the food!  I wanted to go on my last day but I didn't have enough time. The crepes were divine. I ordered the mixed berry one and walked over to the ice cream stations and topped it off. PERFECTION!Next time I'm in vegas I will be stopping here for brunch.   My only point of criticism if the bathroom. There was only one toilet in a buffet! Which means line ups. Wasn't too pleased about that but the food made up for it.
No more made to order omelets and you can't pick exactly what you want in your crepes, instead you just pick from a predetermined list of crepes and pre-made scrambled eggs. I understand that the change makes it faster getting through lines but it definitely isn't as great of a value as it was. The rest of the food was just mediocre
Went here for dinner on 06/04/14.. . The crepes were soggy even though it was made to order. A predetermined menu gave you a selection. No "alittle of this and alittle of that". Station was dirty and was shocked to see a large plastic cup with TIPS written on it sitting on the counter. . . Went to get a roll and was honestly horrified at the broken and chipped 'sneeze guard' (not sure of the official name) that was being held together with MASKING TAPE! Yes...MASKING TAPE! What? No manager in his or her right mind would allow this if they were paying attention to it. Side Note: Bread was stale.. . Food counters were filthy and looked like they hadn't seen a good scrub down or even wipe down in days.. . Desserts - total disappointment.. . What a disappointment you are to me my dear Paris.. . I will not be back.
Wow, nice surprise! The variety and quality of food were great, I do not drink alchocol, so not comments on that. I will definitely come back!
One of the better Vegas buffets. All your usual buffet trappings, but with a French twist. It was the macaroons that did me in.
Grate staff but food us not a 25.00 Buffett . . Good to the kids but then if unlike pasta then It's for you. It's a eaters pick ether you love it or hate it. I'm giving 3 out of 5
Solid selection.  Best deal on the Buffet-of-Buffets without the up charge.  I have ranked the buffets we tried because the reviews on here can be deceiving.... #1 Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars...worth the up charge.  You must go.. #2 Le Village at Paris...does not compare to Bacchanal but the best quality of food without the up charge.. #3 Carnival World Cafe at Rio. #4 Spice Market at Planet Hollywood. #5 Flavors at Harrahs. . The last three in my opinion were very similar and mediocre buffet style food.  #1 and #2 had more gormet style food.
HOLY MOLY!!. . This place is so surreal!. This is my favorite buffet!. . Crepes?! Unlimited?!. . Pairs! . Eiffel Tower it has it all. . This is a very good buffet to enjoy for breakfast! The waitress are very outgoing and friendly . . The atmosphere is so phenomenal!!. It's basically like your in pairs the staff are dressed up you have clouds in the ceiling, the walls have bricks they dim the lights the line wait is very well worth it
Cavatappi with truffle cream sauce is the bomb! It tastes amazing. It's better when it's fresh. Everything here is intriguing, the atmosphere, the food, and the employee uniforms. I will come back here again
I can't believe I didn't check the reviews before coming here. This place was disgusting. The price person was ridiculous for such cruddy quality food. . . Where do I start off? I started with soup, as soon as I saw it from a far being swirled around by the chef standing by, I felt a little skeptical about getting it. You could automatically tell that shit was all starch, because it was soooooo thick. It was soooo bland, blegh. Crab legs? That stuff tasted so old, it was frozen cold too. And there's barely any meat. My boyfriend took advantage of their meat selection. He mentioned the meat was tough and bland. We are a big fan of truffle recipes. And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it. . . The only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY. . . The staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too. . . But, I thought this place wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even one of our taxi drivers said that this place is one of the worst buffets here because we told him how we ate there.
My best man and matron of honor and I all ate here for brunch.  The price was $35 each and included mimosas and bloody marys.  There was a wide selection of food to choose from including seafood and sushi.  The food was so-so but I had a nice time.
We had our brunch here and it was really delicious! This is my favorite buffet of the "Buffet of Buffets" pass. . . Line was not that long and we were seated in an area designed like a cottage. I really linked the scenery and atmosphere of Le Village, it was like we were in France!. . The food was excellent! A good amount of variety and plenty of standout items such as the crepe, Eggs Benedict, smoked salmon, macaroons and flan. They also made omelets but I was too full to try it. By the end of the meal, we were all really full and enjoyed it.. . This buffet is definitely one that I revisit when I'm in Vegas again! . . My ranking of the buffets. 1. Le Village Buffet (Paris). 2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio). 3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood). 4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's). . Didn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full!
