Pepperdine cafe. A little pricy, portion size are pretty large, you can easily share with friends, Get an omelet they kill like a whole carton for that shit!. . Ordered. . Buffalo Wings 8.95?. Chicken Soup 4:95:. Steak and Eggs 17.99?. . Fed 4 people. . Should have ordered omelets lots of food haha . . They took a picture, it was hecka small.. . Could have been better. . . This place is popular cause of the decorations
Kitschy and groovy! Hubbie and I lovedthe old vegas diner feel. The cocktail waitresses were even wearing black gowns! Def. for cool people that don't take themselves too seriously! . It really is out there, by Riviera and has it's own parking lot and famous for being in several shows movies like Casino etc. Open 24 hours which is great and has a lounge/bar.. . I know my mom would def. not appreciate it as it is old, not pretty and who knows if they ever dust those fake flower trees hanging over us. The couple we dined with were healthy/picky eaters so the huge portions might've been a turn off. . . But we'll be back! and next time we will SHARE!. corned beef hash was delish, fresh baked blueberry muffin was great, the seafood omelette was good but not too much seafood, kids meals are huge too (maybe share or skip it completely) Sampler huge. Even the salad my friend got was huge and came with fruit too. Mimosas were great! . They take a postcard pic, then try to sell you a bigger copy for $15.
I can't go to Vegas without visiting The Fireside. Delicious drinks(my favorite is the dreamsicle martini), awesome vintage ambiance, and good service. It's a great Vegas must do.
Had the chicken with Dijon sauce, was excellent. The mashed potatoes were especially creamy and good. Service was good. The ambiance was old hooker Vegas.
I've been here a half a dozen times over the years. Every visit was a pleasure.. . The god is good and the drinks are excellent. You'll love the ambiance in the bar. It's the perfect place to take a date.
This place was great . Looks iffy on the outside and totally Funk on the inside.  It's looks like Gorge Clinton was the interior designer.  The food was really good and the staff was very friendly.  They are open 24 hours "+" very recommend.
Best breakfast in Las Vegas!  Been coming here for years, but on our most recent visit, we ate exclusively at Peppermill each morning.  The food is delicious and the presentation is photo-worthy (seriously, we saw two different guests taking pics with their meals before eating).  Love everything about this place - the neon, the cocktail servers in evening gowns at 7 am, the friendly wait staff, and - of course - the food.  I'm already thinking about our next visit!
They take time on their drinks.. And they are strong!  This is a must stop whenever you are in vegas.  It..just..looks..WEIRD?!  but really cool.  The food is fantastic and the portions are huge.  Prices are reasonable too.  Dont forget to check out the lounge too.. really cool spot
This is the first time we ate at the Peppermill. From the outside it looks like a 1950s diner. Once you get inside other reviews called it a Denny's wannabe while others compare the decorating to a cruise ship. I think both of those descriptions are appropriate, only in a very positive way. Our server came to the table right away. She took our drink orders and answered questions about the menu. The couple we went with had there before. They warned us about the size of the portions and so we decided to share a salad. Boy that was enough. We had the steak salad. They prepared the steak perfectly. Volume of food was huge. We certainly did not leave hungry. I would recommend this restaurant for an informal meal at a very reasonable price. Don't expect anything fancy. But the food is good and I will plan to go back again.
Servers here were very nice! * Very "welcoming" * my first visit was back 2010 and came back yesterday, awesome food and great experience!
Great place to eat and drink late night on the strip. We hit the restaurants around 10PM and service fairly prompt given how busy the place was. We ordered the Eggs Benedict and roast beef sandwich. Both tasted great! I'd compare this place to an upscale Denny's with atmosphere and look (like many have already said) of a cruise liner. . . We did order a couple of drinks (which you must order from the cocktail waitress instead of your server for some reason) and they tasted great as well. (We ordered the 64 ounce monster drink) Overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food. Parking was easy to find also.
A classic!! Great service and delicious food. HUGE PORTIONS TOO!!!!! Try the egg and ham omelette (w/bacon) AAAAMAZING!!!  . . Plenty of parking but this place gets packed fast. Wait time can be up to 45mins so keep that in mind.
The Peppermill is way far from the glitz and glamour of the strip; but it's def worth a trip for an any time of the day; gigantic cheap meal.. . The dining experience will also take you back to old school style Vegas diner with the funky carpet and floral printed upholstery and indoor trees and string lights.... . Yes. Definitely old school.. . I did however; enjoy their food too.. . Loved the French toast.. and my husband got some gigantic Scramble that just filled me up as soon as it was left on our table.. . Great service.
So The Peppermill or "The Mill" as I called it 26 or so years ago. Not 1 thing has changed and that is a great thing. Still over the top tacky decor, kinda like an ewwwwww feeling in the lounge and huge portions of great food. Thanks for the great memories Peppermill.
Classic Vegas!   This restaurant has amazing service and even better food.  Theomelettes are the best we ever had.  Be sure to go in back and check out the fireside room-it's incredible!
It's a classic. You must check it out. Anthony Bourdain said so. However, the only thing to order here are the drinks in the Fireside Lounge. Trust. . . We ordered the nacho's one night thinking it would be a good picky pick. Wrong! The heighth of the "fixin's" nearly hits the 12" mark! We ordered a side if chips to just dig into it. After 10 minutes we gave up & offered them to our fellow fireside-ers. . . It's a fun 80's Vegas meets Disney room and very fun to chill in. Order a mai tai and enjoy the whack.
Ordered a medium rare BBQ bacon burger with guac on the side. They forgot the guac, but I didn't need it by the time I saw how huge and juicy the burger already was. My friends got omelettes, scrambles, and other burgers. Come HUNGRY because the portions are HUGE. you will leave with leftovers. Quick service is always a huge plus!
This is a great place to eat on The Strip.  You get big portions for cheap.  Most places on The Strip cost an arm and a leg for a good meal.  The menu is huge too.  You can get breakfast, lunch, or a dinner at just about any time of day.  However, be prepared to wait, whatever time of day it is, you will more than likely have to wait for a table.  And the service is ok.  But the food and prices are worth it.
This place is a must for tourist and locals alike!  The Fireside Lounge is ideal for playing kissy face on a date night.  If you are bringing the family, then eat in the main dining room.. . Great late night dining!
Food is yummy and the portions are huge I suggest splitting. It's a great place to people watch also. I have never been on the lounge side. The decor is unusual to say the least. Low ceilings with dark mirrored tiles. Purple booths. Very kitchy.
Good food with lots of variety and fast, friendly service.  This restaurant was a welcome relief from all the over-priced places on the Strip--so great to not have to sacrifice quality of good for an affordable price!
The hostess underestimated the time by half an hour.  Could have chosen another option   When I waited my 45 minutes and went back to check at hostess stand she told me it would be another 25 minutes rather rudely.  The manager Beau defended her by stating it is hot out and people don't rush to leave. No apologizes   The menu has been abbreviated and many items deleted that were popular staples.  I frequent this restaurant and recommend it to many tourists.  Needless to say that won't be occurring any longer
We were staying at the Riviera, so this place is basically the closest restaurant not in the Riviera food court. I had heard many things about the Peppermill - it was old, it was basically Denny's, you had to wait forever, etc. I still wanted to try it out, and I'm glad I did!. . It is old. It's more of a relic of 80's Vegas. The Fireside Lounge is really cool, but very smoky. Not that great of ventilation. . . The food was hit or miss, but the portions are so big you really don't care that much. Or you are probably drunk like most people in Vegas. Just make sure you get something you REALLY like because you are going to have a lot of it. Like, maybe the biggest portion of your life. Peppermill makes Chipotle look like a joke. . . I say come by if you are on that side of the strip. It's a fun place and your only meal of the day if you play it right! The only con is there is always a wait.
Best place to go for late night grub, serving size is huge and if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend the mud pie.  Its super chocolatey goodness with a large amount of ice cream.  The strawberry shortcake and brownie desserts come in a huge glass cup with ice cream which are also great . It's a diabetic coma waiting to happen .
Good service, tasty food, and the "fruit cup" was fresh fruit.  I was put off by the coffee that is priced at $2.95 but it was delicious and my waitress offered me a go cup.  . She didn't fill it with the half cup I had left, she filled it up with fresh.  We'd eat here again!
