Beautiful setting and crepes are the only selling point of this buffet. The rest of the food is mediocre at best and the servers are not the friendliest in Las Vegas and act like you are an inconvenience to them whenever you ask for anything. Maybe they are trying to be authentically French  :-)
Perhaps I was expecting too much, but these my 3rd and 4th visits to Le Village Buffet (we had both dinner and breakfast) where nowhere as successful as the previous one.. . DINNER. . We got the Buffet of Buffets pass ($50 for 24-hours entrance to associated buffets), so we didn't go for dinner until 8 PM - which shouldn't be particularly late in a city like Las Vegas, but apparently was.  The place was hopping and there were enough people in line that I was happy we had made a reservation through open table, but some dishes had not been replenished and the quality of the food was less than stellar.. . This time I started with the capatti with truffle sauce, which was almost as good as last year.  The duck a l'orange was overcooked and a little tough, but not too greasy and the orange sauce was good.  Scalloped potatoes were as good as I remembered.  Same thing for the tri-tip.. . Other dishes were a failure.  Both the prime rib and the stuffed lamb were dry, the former was also chewy.  The mac & cheese had peas instead of bacon, and even my 9-year old didn't like it.  The sole was cooked florentine style, and also seemed dry.  They were out of quiche when I visited.  The pork belly, which had been served in a cute individual plate last year, now had the texture and flavor of pork shoulder, but still managed to feel dry in my mouth.  I usually like my dishes salty, but I felt most of the meat was oversalted.. . For dessert I had a made-to-order crepe with mixed berries and bananas inside, and caramel sauce, powdered sugar, whipped cream and candied hazelnuts outside.  It was outstanding, delicious, perfect.  I would much recommend.. . The creme brule was also quite good, and there was a square cheesecake with berry fruit inside which was also delicious.  Other cheesecakes weren't, but I didn't  try too many of the desserts.  . . Service was good, but all in all, I didn't think it was a particularly noteworthy meal.. . BREAKFAST. . Breakfast this morning was also disappointing - or would have been if I had paid full price for it.  None of the pastries looked appetizing, they weren't French and they were served cold! My daughter likened them to pastries from Costco.  We didn't actually try them, however, so perhaps they weren't so bad.  She had a muffin and enjoyed them.  . . My husband said the slab bacon was pretty good.  They have a wide assortment of savory dishes, but I prefer sweet fair in the morning.. . So I had a crepe, or rather, a crepe and a half. One was like the one I described above, and the other was its #1 crepe, the one with banana and nutella.  I enjoyed them both.  However, there is a creperie right outside selling crepes for $11, which is a better deal than the breakfast buffet.. . The coffee was OK, the orange juice was low-quality bottled stuff.  . . Again, not really impressed.
I loooooveeeee the Prime Rib here is very tender and tasty. . . I made reservations through OpenTable to avoid waiting in line since I could get very impatient standing in a long line. So yes, my friend and I have avoided the long line and we went through the "VIP" door where we checked in, paid, and got seated right away. . . Our server came up to our table right away to take our drink order and we've proceeded to getting our food. The moment I saw Prime Rib... I've patiently waited for the people in front of me to get their cut and make up their minds about which sauce to put. Next, I went to their seafood area and there was a horde of people taking all the crab legs which I find very annoying... because hello people you're not the only ones at the buffet to take all of those crab legs. I left but I had an intention to go back for my second round of plate. . . I saw the dessert selections and I love their french macaroons the most... the same person taking all the crab legs was behind me so I took all the chocolate french macaroons.. I mean seriously there was only 5 left lol payback I guess?. . In the end... I got my crab legs and left a happy camper. Our server was very quick and attentive filling up our waters and other drinks. NOMNOMS
Las Vegas is the land of buffets, but choosing the right one is the difference between getting yourself sick with wonderful dishes and getting yourself sick with hepatitis A. Le Village Buffet will poison you with two main delicacies: their dishes and their prices. Relative to other buffets, Le Village is not only more economic but more worthy of your time and palate. Their many stations offer food from various regions of France. You will also get your typical buffet items like salad and dessert bars. Weekend brunch with champagne and mimosas is not to be missed. Their crepe station and coffee are my personal favorites. Make a free reservation through Open Table and skip the ridiculous line. Choose this place over Wicked Spoon and The Buffet at Wynn any time.
$30.99 for all-you-can-eat? I'm sold. The all-you-can-drink deal is a great value as well. But what was more noteworthy was the food. Boy was it delicious! I also loved the atmosphere of the place and had quite a relaxing dining experience. My only complaint was the long wait, but this place is busy for a reason. Definitely worth the wait. I've been here before and I will definitely come here again!
I honestly think this is the best value buffet on the strip. We had a Groupon but I would pay full price in the heart beat next time - and there will be a next time! Unbelievable breads, creative dishes like apples and pork belly (SO GOOD), and this pasta I could eat for every meal and just love. All these things would give it 4 stars but then the CREPE! Omg the apple crepe is literally to die for. Find room for it. Highly recommend - and I've eaten at all the major buffets on the strip.
We find this to be the second best Caesar's buffet. Planet Hollywood is slightly better and we find the Bacchanal to be average and way too expensive. What we like about Le Village is the decor, always French Onion soup, creepes station, and many little other things that make ti worthwhile. . . We find the salads to be fresh, and plenty of options. Desserts are among the best and a nice variety. However, the location of the desert station is the omelet station for breakfast and it is in an awkward spot. . . Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, we have had them all and we just like this place. The line can be long unless you are Diamond or Platinum where you can just walk right up and get seated right away. . . Staff is always attentive and friendly. Most bend over backwards to make your meal enjoyable. Just take a deep breath, and make sure you look over everything. Like we said, not the best in Vegas but really decent. The only drawback is that they keep raising their prices and for a Monday $29 is way too much for dinner when there are plenty of other choices. Sooner or later, people will stop paying these high buffet prices and things can go back to where they should be - around $20 at the most.
I am very disappointed with this buffet as we had a party of ten and were told in order to sit together we had to include an 18% gratuity or they would have to split us up. We told them to split us up as I'm sorry but I am getting my own food and you are bringing me drinks and supposed to be picking up our plates which did not happen once. It's like once we decided to split they were not Happy and wrote a big SPLIT on our Check and each waitress said oh their a split and made sure we were in 2 different rooms far apart from each other when there was plenty of room in our room and other people came in so they still had other party of fives in there. They were not friendly and although the food was good and had a good variety we will not be returning due to the poor customer service and horrible attitude of the staff. The other 3 buffets split us no problem and still sat us by each other and guess what we left a good tip. I mean we brought 10 people to your buffet but I refuse to be forced into a set gratuity for not doing anything. If it were a regular restaurant then I would understand the gratuity as they are working their butts off to provide service. It was ridiculous and uncalled for and I have to say the selection and service at the spice market were awesome and they were packed and still did an awesome job!
This buffet is not worth the $33 they charge. The food was mediocre at best. I would NOT suggest this to any of my friends or family.
This was part of our buffet pass. And honestly I would come to this buffet solely for breakfast. I would go to either planet Hollywood or rio for dinner if I had the world of buffets pass. Simply because the selection here is really small. The meat cutter for dinner is a great guy very comical. But I would stick to breakfast here because the creeps are amazing.
