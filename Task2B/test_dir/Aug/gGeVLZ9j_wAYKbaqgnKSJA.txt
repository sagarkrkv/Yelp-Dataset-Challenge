Food was really really good, really expensive tho, but thats what you can kinda expect at a place like this. One of the best asian themed restaurants on the las vegas strip. Make sure to get dessert
Great ambiance! Food was exceptional! The service was... unique. When our server approached drinking from a beer bottle, I thought our he was another guest coming to socialize. While I was a little taken aback, he really knew that menu, though. He was very helpful & informative, but had tendencies to give TMI on his personal life. Overall, this was the best service we had experienced throughout our Vegas trip!
I forgot to give this place a review, oops. But hi.. . Back in March, I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner and we both loved the atmosphere. A bit too dark and noisy, but that's to be expected. The food was okay, but not WHOA WOW HOLY CRAP WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE kind of feeling. Me and my boyfriend specifically remember our waiter's name, Lars, because he really was probably the best server we've met. He gave us a complimentary fortune cookie thing that was the size of my head with fruits on the side when we told him we chose this place to have our anniversary dinner. So Lars, if you're reading this and still working there, you're amazing man.
The restaurant is beautiful with great ambiance! The wait staff are some of the best in the country!  The food is incredible!  My God, what more could you ask for? I will return over and over again every time I visit Las Vegas.  I think you should too!
Ummmm... YUCK! My food was disgusting and $38 a plate. I swear to you I've had better chinese food at the mall for $8.  I'm giving them two stars because it's not their fault, it's mine. I had been warned that their food was pretty bad and I went anyway. I deserved that plastic tasting chicken.
This past weekend I had home to Vegas with my friends and then I met this amazing guy there and he wanted to take me to dinner... He said I'll look for something and looked at the reviews on yelp and made reservations! . . As soon as we walked in I could tell he was really into making an impression because the decor was stunning!  The atmosphere was elegant and sophisticated. . . Our server was amazing and patient.  We sat down and started the whole first date questions and every time our server would come we would me so wrapped up in our conversation we would forget to order lol.  But our server was more than happy to come back every time. . . The food was amazing, my date said he didn't like salmon because it was too fishy but he has a taste of my plate and was so amazed.  The sauces were amazing and I have tried salmon every where and this was definitely in my top 3!!  . . Go here is you want a great dinner and time away from the whole party scene for a while.  It's so great!
AMAZING! My favorite meal of our trip! Service was spot on. I started out with the Temple salad and my husband the egg rolls. Both were phenomenal! During our stay I had salmon on 3 different nights.. Tao was the best! My husband had Filet mignon pepper steak and the steak melted in your mouth. For dessert we had ice cream and chocolate spring rolls... again.. delicious! And the fortunes are my favorite. I never tried Tao in NY, but now I am going too! Thank you Tao for an amazing meal!!
Atmosphere:5/5. Food taste:5/5. Proportions :1/5. Portions very, very small for the price.
