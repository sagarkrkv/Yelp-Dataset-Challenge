Love the Beer Rita and the Cheddar Burger with sweet potato fries. It was delicious.
I really enjoy stopping here for lunch when in Vegas.  The atmosphere is fun and the food is good. I have had the seafood mac and cheese which is probably the best thing they have! It has son much cheese and flavor and I don't usually even like mac and cheese! The nachos are some of the best nachosyou can get anywhere and they are huge! They always have lots of toppings and are perfect. Of course there is a great margarita selection and lots of Jimmy Buffet music playing and a gift shop. This is always a quick lunch stop for us to grab a reasonably priced meal before a long day of shopping!
I come here every time I'm in Vegas. I live for the Volcano nachos and they never disappoint. I don't advise ordering the nachos for one person. It is a shareable dish.
This place is a joke! Margaritas - BLAH! No alcohol in them. Chips/Salsa - BLAH! We complained to the waitress and she just blew us off. We didn't even order a meal...we just left. I will never go there again. What a waste of money!
Only had 1 bad drink in vegas, and it was a mango margarita from the walk up bar.  Bar tender was nice and place has great atmosphere but margarita was so sugary couldn't drink it.  Burned my throat and my friend threw his away too.  Not what I expected from margaritaville.
Great food and great specials!!! Great party atmosphere! We had the Jamaica Mistaica wings and the Lava Lava nachos. The nachos will feed at least 4 people! Everything was delicious; especially the $3 margaritas and $3 shots! It's a must that we stop at every Margaritaville we see on vacation. This location did not disappoint!
Our waitress Tabatha was amazing - friendly, knowledgable about the menu and drink specials, and quick to bring our drinks and the extra limes we ordered.  She checked on us at the right times and I felt taken care of.. . The dinner show is about 5 minutes long and happens every half or hour.  It was cute - would definitely bring kids.  The guys on stilts make balloon sculptures - a guy near us celebrating his 73rd birthday had a birthday cake with "73" on the top - all out of balloons.  You can call ahead and put your name on a list for "priority seating" not sure if that actually makes a difference - we were seated pretty quickly.. . They have two tacos for $9.99 - I preferred the pork to the steak.  They were pretty filling - I didn't want to eat anything too big and risk a club-preventing food coma so this was just right! I'll be back for the tacos and good service!
Provided you're at least a casual Jimmy Buffett fan, this restaurant is fun. One of the cheaper meals out I had on the strip. The food was quite good, and the service was more than adequate. The atmosphere is clearly what makes or breaks this restaurant for most people.. . The giant volcano over the main bar of course pales in comparison to the one in front of the Mirage just down the street, but it's purposefully more kitschy and fun. There's a giant "Booze in the Blender" that slowly fills up over an hour and when it does, the "Volcano blows." Most of the floor is decorated to look like you're in open water and several of the tables are decorated like skiffs. We were seated close to the bar on the main 'ship' section of the restaurant. There were several "Postcards from the Road" screens showing a combination of Jimmy Buffett videos and other music from his Sirius XM station. I don't follow Buffett personally but have always been a casual fan. His style of music is fitting for the very very casual atmosphere of the restaurant.. . Just like most musician-themed bar/restaurants, most of the items on the menu are named after forced puns on Buffett songs. This seems to work a little better with Buffett since he actually already has both his own beer and margarita line and songs about food.. . I was tempted to get the "Cheeseburger in Paradise" but instead went with the "Volcano Burger." It had chili and cheese sauce and avocado and Fritos and jalapenos and it was a little overwhelming. The burger kind of fell apart when I tried to eat it. Nevertheless it was tasty and cooked to my liking. The bun was a little dry but not too bad. We went in the afternoon for lunch and did not have to wait long. The burger may have benefited from having the bun scooped out to leave more room for all of the toppings. On the bright side, I had plenty of chili/meat salad to eat after I was finished with my burger from all the toppings that fell off.. . Long story short: Margaritaville is not about the food. It's clearly about spending some time wishing you could ever be as relaxed and carefree as Jimmy Buffett himself. The atmosphere is nice and the food is fine. If you're a Buffett fan you'll have the time of your life, as long as you don't blow out your flip flop.
You guys are such liars. 3.5 stars!? Clearly you made some terrible menu decisions. Let me help you out: order the damn pretzel sticks. You're welcome. . . How great would it have been if I just ended my review there? Chances are you're probably buzzed or wasted so whatever. Congratulations if you're still reading! . . Margaritaville was located very close to our hotel so we stopped in for a bite (who really wants to walk around in 100 degree heat looking for a place to eat?). We were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress came by soon after. . . I ordered a fish sandwich with sweet potato fries - there was so much food I couldn't finish my plate. I didn't even eat the bun (yeah, I was THAT girl. What about it? #carbproblems). . My friend ordered a burger, which she said was really good. My other friend ordered a taco salad, which she could not stop raving about. . . The food was great, the service was fast, and...those damn pretzels were stupid good.  . . I have zero complaints (except that the plate should have more pretzels...). . . Ps: If you're complaining about tackiness, I just want to point out that Vegas is a giant strip of tacky built in the middle of a desert.
We're locals to Vegas, and everyone who comes to town wants to check out margaritaville, though I don't know why we keep accompanying them. The prices are high, the food has never been amazing and the drinks, are good but the got rid of my favorite one over a year ago!!!. . Yesterday we went there again with a party of 10 and I think 1 of the peoples orders came out the way it was ordered.....
Had the tinga chicken and it tasted pretty bad and slimy. Prices are way too high for the quality
We eat here on every visit to LV. This is a great and fun place, and you can actually taste the liquor in your drink. One thing I was disappointed on; the Volcano Nachos now have just chille on it. They use to put chicken,  beef, and pork on them.
Amazing customer service! Fast and delicious! Very happy we decided to check out this place! #Yummy
Great place to enjoy great company with great drinks and food yeah he. Wahoo yippee:) :)
I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan so I was predisposed to like this place. I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise, husband had the Jambalaya, we both thought the food was good. And, as far as prices, compared to the other restaurants on the strip this was on par or better than other places we ate at. Loved the atmosphere. The waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was terrific. I felt comfortable having my 8 year old daughter there--and she was happy to get a balloon animal. She asked me how to get one and I said, "sit here and look like you want a balloon animal." And, that worked. Bahama Mama was awesome. Although I was looking for a Hurricane on the menu. I wish there was a Margaritaville closer to us in MI. Maybe I'll add visiting all of them to my bucket list.
