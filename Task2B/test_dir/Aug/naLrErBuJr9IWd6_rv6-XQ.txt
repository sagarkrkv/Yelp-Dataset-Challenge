Amazing! Seriously amazing! From the amuse to the banana cream pie, everything was utterly delicious. We started with the  steak tartare and the crab and shrimp Louis. We then split the American Waygu ribeye and the lobster. Hands down the best meal ever!
Very overpriced and pretty average food. Nothing too exciting. Attempt to provide stellar service actually came across as constant interruptions and too chatty. I alerted them to my gluten allergy and they would joke about it every!!!! time they dropped bread and linger. Would stop by constantly until we were ready to close out bill...this part took forever. The presentation of raw meat as you order was unappetizing too. Would not recommend this place out of all the amazing Vegas options.
Absolutely an amazing experience! By far one of the best service I've ever had (and I'm also a server so my expectations are a tad bit higher haha). I was here tonight for a bachelorette dinner with 9 other girls & our server Richard was the best! I speak for everyone when I say that he did such a great job in making sure all of us were taken care of. Yes, it's expensive but aside from the fact that the food is deliciously mouth warming, I promise you the service you get from here will make your money worth it. I will definitely come back again my next trip to Vegas!
Went there last night with my wife. Service was superb. Everyone is very professional precise and knowledgable with their answers. The atmosphere is great, medium lighting where you can see your food and have a romantic evening. Food was excellent, prepared exactly as ordered. I would visit this place again on my next trip to vegas
Amazing dining experience! The service from Ben and James was great! We started with the asparagus appetizer- yum yum and perfect rose champagne. We enjoyed the Illinois petit cut filet mignon and the Nebraska petit cut New York cooked to chefs preference. House steak and peppercorn sauces to dip in. Between the two of course the filet was better, but they both cut like butter and melted in your mouth. Mac and cheese for our side and it was delicious and a half bottle of Sangiovese to compliment our steaks. Banana cream pie for dessert it was perfect- light and refreshing. A divine dining experience.
Best servers around hands down, best Martini drinks I have had, very good wine selection, best appetizers to the main course, pricy but worth every penny. This place made our whole Vegas trip. Will be going back.
Over priced and under sized steaks. The atmosphere is wonderful and staff friendly and attentive. TBH, you shouldn't have to fill up on bread and sides to make up for the portion sizes of the steaks. I've eaten at many of the top restaurants in the US and just felt ripped off in the end. Better choices
Over cooked $58 ribeye. Second one tasted salty and charred. Temp was good but no efforts to correct. For that much money, it's a shame. Will do my best to divert people from coming here.
My boyfriend and I recently ate here for our anniversary. The service was great and very attentive. They offer complimentary parmesan bread sticks and delicious cheesy soft mini popovers at the beginning of your meal. You must not have too much or else you'll be too full for their prime steaks. . . We ordered the pork belly and tuna tartare appetizers which were delicious. We were also offered a variety of bread and I definitely recommend the pretzel knot; its sweet and salty.. so yummy! My boyfriend and I both ordered NY strip steak and it was cooked to perfection per our request. We were also offered a complimentary slice of banana cream cake with a sweet 'Happy Anniversary' message which was just the perfect ending to our meal.
Day 4 of my Las Vegas getaway (almost two weeks ago).  Day 1 included dinner at Gallagher's for steak which I found to be pretty good but not great.  So, let's try steak again but this time at Wolfgang Puck's CUT.  . . The restaurant was busy with a nice energetic ambiance.  I ordered the Nebraska Corn-fed rib-eye with green peppercorn sauce and wild field mushrooms.  On the side I had the fingerling potatoes with bacon and onions and glass of Heitz Cellars cabernet.  Cocktail was called Pins and Needles.. . The Good - The service was efficient and impeccable.  The wine was perfect and the cocktail was excellent.  The fingerling potato side with bacon was great.  I could have eaten an entire plate of them.  Maybe I should have after you read the Bad and the Ugly below.. . The Bad and the Ugly - I had such high hopes to finish my stay in Las Vegas with a great steakhouse experience.  What a disappointment.  The rib-eye I ordered was cooked perfectly and oh so tender.  The first bite was heaven.  After three or four bites I realized how salty the steak was.  Before I finished half of the steak there was so much salt on my palate I could barely taste my wine and other food.  I had to drink the entire 750 ml bottle of sparkling water I ordered.  Because of the salty meat I could finish neither my meal, wine, or the cocktail.. . The waiter did remove the cost of the meat from my bill but I didn't care about that.  I wanted a great steakhouse experience and was sorely disappointed.   Wolfgang, this establishment needs some of your personal attention.. . (I updated my review based on the response I received from management; professional and courteous as you would expect.  I will indeed give CUT another try on my next trip to Vegas and am confident that it will be a much better experience as others here have raved.)
Service alone deserves 5 stars. Everyone- from the hostess to the server- were so attentive and accommodating. The ambience was intimate and classy. We had the steak tartare (not the best I've had, but still VERY good), the crab and shrimp appetizer (fantastic), the asparagus (severely overpriced), the fingerling potatoes (incredible), and the rib eye which was tough, well seasoned, but too difficult to eat. The banana cream pie was honestly the best part. The best dessert I've had in a long time, and the best banana cream pie dessert ever. A fantastic meal and dining experience, even though the meal had some lacking aspects.
Simply amazing, one of the best service that I have experienced. The food was very good and they cook their steak on the wood so the steak taste so natural and traditional which I love. I would recommend this restaurant.
Wagyu beef tasting was amazing! Always a great experience at CUT!
Yes, it is expensive.  BUT, it may very well be the best meal I have ever had.  The American wagyu was unbelievable as was everything else that was served up.  Back up the Brinks truck and then sit back and enjoy a one of a kind meal.
After seeing every steakhouse repeated from NYC we wanted something new so we settled on Cut. What a great experience.  The server was more knowledgeable then most I encounter in NYC. We went to order a particular cut of meat and the waiter said we would enjoy something better because it was to mineraly. Fantastic sevice, fantastic meal. Highly recommended.
