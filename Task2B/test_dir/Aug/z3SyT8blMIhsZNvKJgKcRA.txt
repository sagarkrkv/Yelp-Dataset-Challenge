Stayed at Caesars Palace for a weekend, and it was a blast. I stayed in the Octavius tower, and the decor is very modern. Our room had a very nice view of the pool. The beds are very comfortable, too. I also used their gym, which is decent. They do need a few more benches for bench press, but other than that the gym is clean and well maintained. I definitely recommend Caesars to anyone looking for a nice hotel in Vegas.
Just came back from Vegas. Stayed at Caesar's. Room was beautiful, Venus pool was OK. Went to drai's rooftop pool across the street at the Cromwell, got free admission, drinks were priceythough. . . At caesars staff were very good and prices were reasonable. Went to the bacchanal buffet for dinner it's 50 ahead but sooo good and so many options. . . I would recommend Caesar's it's pretty cool and central. Just the no free wifi was a pain for me. So it's really a 3.5 star for me but still I would return.
So I'm a Vegas regular for sure and I would say this is in the top three hotels to stay at in Vegas! Very classy and elegant. The forum shops are amazing and the forum itself is beautiful. The rooms are good sized and always clean. I would defiantly recommend this hotel!
After our night at the LVH (read my review), we moved over here because the Boyfriend has a near-unhealthy fascination with the movie "The Hangover.". . Since we had the renal car, we needed to drive from one hotel to the other. This is normally a very simple task but Las Vegas Blvd. was closed! After drying around in circles a couple of times, we called the front desk for help We got transferred to Security who told us exactly where we needed to go. We got to the parking garage in no time after that.. . When it was time to check in, the front desk staff was very friendly. I am not sure if they upgraded us by mistake but our $99 room was HUGE; it might have been bigger than our apartment. WE always asked for non-smoking rooms & even though the front desk assumed me the whole tower is non-smoking, I still smelled smoke periodically...wonder why.
I love this hotel, it has an amazing mall with lots of stores, its called the forum. i recommend all to check it out, they have a huge nike store with all the stuff you can think of. It's a great place for you and your kids to stroll around and check out!
On our arrival the bellman was OUTSTANDING, he told us what and where everything was on our way to our room. Our room in the Palace Tower was a mini suite, when we booked we got offered a buy up for a suite if available on check in, it was and what a steal for an extra $17 a night..  So many great restaurants to choose from you could stay here and never go any where else but there are a couple of down sides, Starbucks was always understaffed no matter when we got there, peak breakfast rush one person making drinks and two ringing in orders with a line down the hallway. Central is a great breakfast option, food is good but it depends on your server, your wait could be a while. Payard is over priced poorly made classic french dishes, a total let down..  We only stayed in house for dinner a couple of nights, Nobu is a DON'T miss, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was good food for a good price and the food court give alots of options but be warned it closes at 11pm. This  is the down side to Caesars, there is very little late night choices for food..  We only encounter one member of staff on the Casino floor that truly stood out, Steve on the Craps table in the back near Gordon Ramsay's..   Over all this is a nice property but it would be so much better is the staff and the total experience lived up to the Caesar's name. We liked out stay and will visit the property again just not sure if we would stay here again.
I did not stay here but just the scenery alone is worth 5 stars. I took many pictures inside and outside this casino. There are also many cool shops inside as well. This casino is definably worth walking through.
I just got back from staying at Caesars Palace for 2 days for my birthday. My sister and I had stayed here before when Elton John was supposed to perform and he cancelled the morning of the concert. I thought that was pretty messed up, but decided to stay at Caesars again because the room was free. The ONLY reason I'm giving Caesars 2 stars is because the room was clean and the people that work there are pretty nice. . . Here are the things I did NOT like about Caesar and will never stay there again. . . No wifi? You have to pay $25.00 for wifi, they have wifi EVERYWHERE! Why in the hell should anyone pay for wifi? I thought that was a rip off! The other thing that sucked was they had bottled water in the room for $6.00 each. Down the hall where the vending machine is, the bottles are $3.00. It was the same exact water! . . The gambling there was SAD! Put the money in, nothing comes out. I finally went to other casino's to see if it were any better elsewhere. It wasn't. . . Okay the other thing that I was getting REALLY upset about was every time you walk down the hallway on the casino level there are these stores and the people working in the stores hassle you to take a sample. I finally just would look away and they'd call MADAM MADAM try our free samples. I feel that is SO tacky and I felt like I was being hassled every time I went down that way. It was very annoying!. . I didn't feel safe there. Many strange people looming around.. . It was not a very good experience. I went to MGM and they advertise that they have free wifi. So IF I ever go back to Vegas, I'll stay there. Any place but Caesars!
Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights and loved it! We were supposed to stay in the Roman Tower but they upgraded us to the Palace Tower for free. The room was beautiful, clean and spacious. This hotel is on the strip and relatively close to everything else. I would definitely stay here again!
Love Caesar's Palace - right in the center of the strip, and has (almost) everything you need so that you don't need to leave. . . PROs:. - Free self and valet parking. - Pet friendly room options. - Nobu Hotel and Restaurant. - Forum Shops (anything from Sephora to H&M to Christian Louboutin). . CONs:. - No breakfast options besides Starbucks or the buffet. - Sports Book area has limited seating. - Lack of bars playing all sports games on for the bf. - Small poker area compared to other casinos
Caesars Palace is one of the first casinos built on the strip.  I haven't ever stayed here but got the opportunity to experience it first hand when my cousins stayed here.  I've made pit stops at Serendipity 3 for frozen hot chocolate; this is a must!! Also had the buffet with the crab legs which is awesome.. . Spent time down at the pool which is a great; there is a ton of seating and three different pools plus the private pool.  Not a ton of shade so going in the middle of a summer day might be a little brutal.
Ah, Caesar's...you disappoint me. You're employee parking area on East Flamingo Road is always filthy! Everyone sees this as they drive or walk by and it's highly disgusting! Beer bottles, paper, escort cards...ICK!
The guy actually said we weren't in a smoking room, that it was "smoking optional."  My wife replied that she was glad it wasn't "smoking required.". . We finished our vacation at the Venetian where we had an incredible time....read below for the full story.. . I would go back to Caesars for the restaurants, and Forum Shops...which you don't need to stay there for.  I wouldn't stay there again.. . This all comes down to Customer Service.  I also gave them several chances to fix this and they didn't so I have no problem sharing here.  I booked a non-smoking room, at least six months in advance.. . When we arrived, they offered us an upgrade as soon as we got there.  Great...all seemed fine.  We get to our room and it smells like the last guest stomped out his/her Marlboro light just a couple of hours ago.. . We go down and tell them we reserved a non smoking room.  They tell us, they upgraded us to the Roman Tower, but that all non-smoking rooms were taken..."we're very sorry."  The guy actually said we weren't in a smoking room, that it was "smoking optional."  My wife replied that she was glad it wasn't "smoking required.". . Too make a long story short, they allegedly couldn't get us a non-smoking room until the next day.  The night manager told us to come back at 11am the next morning and they would give us a non-smoking room.  At 11am the manager on duty explained they couldn't give us a room until after 4pm, since no one had checked out yet.  That makes sense, but I was done with Caesar at this point...thousands of rooms in this hotel, even more in their sister properties and they couldn't find one non-smoking room.  They didn't even care to try...every answer, without even walking away from the desk, was..."sorry.". . We finished our vacation at the Venetian where we had an incredible time.
Great place to stay on The Strip!. . PARKING: Self-parking is sooo far away from the check-in! You're gonna get a good workout walking there. Should've done valet.. . ROOM: Stayed in the older tower, which smells like old vomit. Disgusting. The shops leading to the tower also smells, and across from the tower is the entrance to the pool, which also smells. Ughhhh every time I had to walk in that area, I tried to hold my breath because it was so bad! The room had a nice view of the pools, and it was very spacious! The bathroom had a shower stall, toilet, two sinks, and a jacuzzi! There was a nice vanity area in the room too. . . POOL: Suuuper nice pools! They have four pools and a bunch of seats to lay out in!. . OVERALL: Would come back, but would request to stay in the other tower!
My wife and I could not have been treated better.  The service was exceptional, the room was perfect, the hotel was beautiful. I will not stay anywhere else when in Vegas.  The pool area is over the top.  The clientele was a good mixture of young and not so young.  We had aterrific time.
I did not spend a night at this hotel so I can not really judge it, but based on what I have seen in the lobby I would not spend a night here. For one, there are reeking Smells in the hotel and secondly there is very unentertaining entertainment. But on the plus side it is located in a convenient location and has many nice restaurants in the lobby.
We had another great experience at this Casino?  We got the VIP treatment at a separate reservation desk.  A + customer service.
I have tried just about all the buffets in Vegas. And I would have to say the buffet at Ceasars is by far thee best. I thought how they give you the choice to warm up your crab legs in boiling water that totally brings out the flavor more. Oysters taste so fresh and yummy. They also have so so many other delicious foods to choose from. Wait times are usually 1 hr on weekends.
I've always liked Caesars but in the past year  we've had 2 bad experiences. The last time I wrote and explained our issues with our room and the response was great and the service the next time, as well as the room were great. This time we have a room where the shower is extremely small, set up with a folded seat for handicap accessibility and entire bathroom way below par!  The room is nice for a Quality Inn maybe, not for Caesars. The television is so small and old we can't read the guide from bed or seating. The room is underwhelming in decor and amenities. Very disappointed in the entire experience. I've heard others in our tower have very nice rooms.
The hotel facilities are very nice.  We got upgraded to the Augustus tower with a very nice view of the Bellagio fountain.  The pool is very big and nice as well.. . What was not great was the check in experience.  We got there to check in around 4 and were told our rooms were not ready.  They had no idea how long it was going to take for the rooms to be ready so we were told that they would call us when it was.  We checked back in about 2.5 hours later but with no luck.  After 4 hours, we checked with the front desk again and it was ready.  They didn't even call us.  They gave us an upgrade, but we would have rather got the rooms we paid for and check in on time, this ruined our plans for the evening.
We stayed in Caesars Palace on August 2014 for 2 days. We stayed in the Palace tower premium room with king bed (previously known as petite suite). In summary, we were very pleased with the entire experience.. . Parking:. It is true!! Caesars Palace parking is quite big and very far from the main lobby, and even further away from the room you will end up staying. It will be much better to do vallet parking. . . Check-in:. We checked in on Friday, so the line was quite long. However, they managed to take care everybody somewhat quick (under 30 min). They also offered us (and other customers) water while waiting to be served. The front desk was very friendly.. . Bathroom:. Our bathroom was impressive. We had 2 sides of bathroom (supposedly, one for him and one for her), 2 toilet (one is regular... presumably for him, and one is accompanied with a bidet). One side of the bathroom has Jacuzzi bubble tub where you can relax yourself while getting bubble massage.. . Bedroom:. The room decor was quite nice. Room area is spotless. Carpet was clean and vibrant. The king bed was very comfortable. Definitely, one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on. Our room was facing the pool. Thus, the window view is quite spectacular.. . One thing that caught my attention was how friendly the staff is..... from the front desk, room keeper, bellboy, etc. We definitely put Caesars Palace on our favorite Vegas hotel. It's Caesars Palace, you should not expect anything less.
Unnecessary  expensive , rude employees , our room smelled like a dead body , our towels had holes . With a money you pay you may go to better place .
