Love this place!! The best item is the bulgogi tacos.
Love this place, they have the best tofu & veggie tacos ever, even better if you add kimchi. Also have awesome veggie fried rice (one of few places that is generous with the veggies), amazing complimentary chips with side of guac & fresh salsa. There is an  exceptional array of host made sauces- so good we get one of them to go and enjoy with all sorts of food at home (Korean hot sauce). Lastly, their prices rock & they recognize their regular customers.
As a former-local, this is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Family-owned and made to order, you can taste the care out into the food. My recommendation is to order from the fusion part of the menu as opposed to the just Korean or Mexican parts though there isn't much you won't love on the menu. The fusion burrito is my go-to and a crowd pleaser. This place is good for vegetarians!
The chow fettucini was so/so. But the flautas were absolutely amazing, I would eat them everyday. The service was good, the restaurant was clean, and it was a nice simple meal.
In town for a soccer tournament. We wanted to try something new. This place was by far the best choice we made on our trip. Great food, good price, and even better portions!!. . Thanks KoMex
I love this place.  The chimichanga is my favorite.  Plus the people who work here are so nice.  I have been to both locations and do not have a favorite one yet.  Good food.  I can't wait to go back.
First time here. Nice service. Tasty delicious goodies. Chips and salsa and guacamole for free. Very yum. Had the bulgogi beef plate added the Kim Che rice. Super good. Nice flavor and sweetness on the beef and the flavorful taste of the kimchee in the fried rice was so delicious. My girl had the fusion flautas.  Bulgogi and mozzarella inside a fried tortilla with an amazing Korean hot sauced guacamole.  Really flipping good. Good eats will be back.
these guys are on it!  the food is pretty inventive, even though by now there are many places to get korean fusion around the country.  the food is really tasty.  if you are in vegas and have a rental car, then it is worth it to venture off the strip and visit.
I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time now & was so excited to try it out in hopes of finding a new favorite Vegas place to eat. I will say the food was good, but not mind blowing spectacular with every bite.. . I ordered the bulgogi chimichanga, my husband ordered the burrito version and we split bulgogi fries. The Korean sauce was tasty, the meat was tasty. The fries themselves seemed like frozen fries, nothing that great. I also expected more cheese on the fries.. (Shredded, wasn't all melted). The food definitely had flavor I just get the feeling what I experienced wasn't as good as this place used to be (from reading other older reviews). Could use just a tad bit more. some of the food was a little bit/ almost on the dry side. I would love to give it a try again but not sure if we will since it's on the opposite side of town for us.
I was in the area around lunch time so I yelped a restaurant and this one seemed to get pretty good reviews. . The interior looks a little dingy so I expected that I would have to order at the counter, but it turned out to be a sit down restaurant. They give you chips, salsa and guacamole when you first sit down. I had the half order bogogi chicken plate with rice, and it was GREAT! The portion was the perfect and really filling. . The service was also really good. I would definitely come back.
Ordered the Vegetarian Chow Fettuccine noodles ...stir fried fettuccine noodles with bell peppers, cabbage and broccoli. Delicious! Also ordered the Bulgogi Flautas- comes with guac and salsa, the crispy tortilla was my fave. . And last but not least...also shared an order of Bulgogi Fries- hit the spot! I would definitely come back to this place.
I've been here twice and it's okay. Service is super slow. Nothing stood out in my opinion.
