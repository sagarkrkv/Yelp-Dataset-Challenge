Our family checked into NYNY and they gave us two vouchers for buffets ($30 off each)  at nearby hotels.  We chose the Bellagio because of the seafood offering.   For a family of four, even with the vouchers, it still cost us $70 + tip.  The prime rib was good and they did have a good variety of seafood but itwas just OK.  The sushi definitely was just buffet quality, nothing special and very limited choice. We had one server for our whole section so it was slow to get our dishes bussed and our waters refilled.. .  All in all it was just an OK dining experience, and we left feeling stuffed from overeating of course.  It was a good value for what we paid, but without the vouchers, we would not do it again.
I've been to a lot of buffets, I've dined at some competing resort's buffets that looked very similar and needing to discard large portions of food there that wasn't prepared properly, or simply low quality.. . So far Bellagio's buffet is the best I've experienced. The food QUALITY is top notch and is as good or better than the entrees at a lot of $50/plate restaurants I've eaten at.. . +1 on the bar seating option, if there is just the two of you it is very convenient to skip the line.
Maybe I picked a bad day, but the quality of food here has really gone down the last few years.   I arrived just before 12pm on Saturday Aug 2, and so many of the stations were still on their breakfast items of pancakes, eggs, etc.   . . All the seafood fish items were really tasteless and very tough.   The pizza should not even be offered, as it looked like something out of the frozen section of a supermarket.   I didn't see any crab legs, but they did have shrimp out, which was pretty good.  . . I will say the desserts were great as always.   Also, service inside at my table was great, but the area where you pay looked totally confused and chaotic.
Definitely not a good buffet experience in Vegas.The food is no big deal. The Sushi quality disappointed me, dry rice and few options and also few options of seafood. The staff are not friendly and polite. Takes forever to replace used plates and to refill beverage. I would recommend other buffet.
Food was 10/10 but there was a minor blunder in service. Our server just disappeared. I kept craning and twisting my neck to look for him cuz we needed more drinks. I eventually called the manager and told her. So she sent another server. Turns out that the servers had switched tables so my original server was serving other tables now and his replacement server had no idea that she's supposed to be serving us. The new server was very nice and it was a happy ending.
Take it from a real foodie, this place is terrible. If you have any food standards, you won't spend your money here. . . Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan had much better quality and the presentation was even better. . . Overcooked seems to be the theme and overall just very subpar quality.
This is my first time here and it was on a weekend.  It was busy but the food was really good.  The Kobe beef was not that great but almost all the other dishes were great.  The sea bass was fishy.  But the dessert bar was amazing... I loved it and made the buffet the best.  They had every kind of dessert you could think of and they were all great.  I will be back again!!
Had a great breakfast/lunch spread! Went from coffee, bacon, eggs and  O'Brien potatoes to spicy tuna hand rolls, sliders, salad and beer! Lots of food choices ...could sit there for hours and get super fat.
So my second time in LV and i had never been to a buffet. I love food and I tend to not have very good self control so I steer clear from places like that. You know the kid in the candy store expression? Sadly that's me when I see food. Here is an example: I can eat pizza 24/7 if it is standing in front of me. I can tolerate the pain it gives me. So I was a bit nervous as there was so much potential for my ass to grow. But I figured when in it Rome, screw it and stuff your face, you are on vacation. Well I am ashamed to say that in 4 days, I went to 3 buffets. See? Zero self control. . . This buffet was suggested by trip advisor as top 5 buffets on the strip. It was second following Caesar's and third was the Wynn one. . . We went in and was told that the wait time was going to be bad. It wasn't all that awful. If you are like me and love people watching (and occasionally judging) then there was plenty of things to see and watch while waiting in line. We anticipated 1 hr and we were in within 30 mins. . . You sit down and the servers come and get your drink order. Then u go and pick your food and thats whereall your troubles begin. HOLLY CHOICES! There were 5 kinds of salmon, cooked in all sorts of ways. Calamari salads, pasta, pizza, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, chicken, ribs, sushi, chinese food, breakfast food, all types of bread, a whole section with fruit and another one with desserts. There wasnt anything that I tried that I didnt like. I went absolutely crazy on seafood and fruit that I couldnt even make it to the pizza section. I was beyond stuffed. Therefore I became the healthiest eater in buffet history. Only fish and fruit. Hey I am ok with that.. The only reason I deducted a star was because a few of the foods were cold. Otherwise, that place was every eater's paradise. Props to bellagio for even keeping up with the abundance food and people.
Best breakfast buffet I've been to. Flavorful, quality, and a great variety of choices for every palate and or dietary restriction. All of this for only $20. It's a steal. While you are there wall through the conservatory.
Great time, the food was delicious, the seafood was amazing, excellent taste and variety, the desserts were out of this world, good experience, the service was good and coffee was delicious. It was pricey but we will go back again.
Great price, even better food!  . . Time of visit: 2pm. Price: $24 (lunch). Food: Everything was fresh and tasty - most notable was the brisket and flank steak.  As for dessert, superior bread pudding!
I ate at the Buffet at Bellagio a couple of years ago and it was nothing less than amazing, so I went back last week during a trip to Vegas.  The food was fresh and selections topped the standard buffet-fare.  The serving area was kept clean (a huge factor for me) and well attended.  The crab legs were plentiful, fresh, and pre-cut.  There were other seafood options that are worth mentioning like mussels, oysters on the half shell, smoked salmon (yummy), etc..  I liked the cheese/deli meat selections as it included prosciutto, cured salami, and tasty cheeses.  This sums up the things I liked.  I took a star away because they have gone downhill a bit.  The desserts used to look hand made and unique.  They now look mass produced.  The flan and creme brulee tasted like the standard buffet custard.  The other dessert choices were mini pies, cakes, pies, etc..  Nothing better than what you would find at a cheap buffet.  They needed more service staff.  Our waitress worked her heart out but she was almost running around to keep up with the demand of clearing plates and filling drinks.  This left the dining area floor looking a little dirty.  . . Overall, this buffet is still a good choice, however they have slipped a little into "ho-hum-drum" over the past couple of years and I may just choose a less expensive option next time around.
This is definitely one of the better buffets in Las Vegas. The price is around 40 bucks for dinner and about 30 for lunch. One of the highlights of the buffet is the fact they have King and Snow crab legs on the buffet. The only thing I didn't like is that they're sold cold,  I'd rather have hot crab legs than cold ones. One great thing about the crab here is that its already cracked and they are served with warm drawn butter unlike other places. Other highlights were sushi bar and the beef. The dessert bar is underwhelming but the hot food selections are pretty vast.  I would like to mention that the food wasn't very gourmet and some dishes need a little more seasoning than others (palella) but I was still pretty satisfied. Staff was great and utensils and bar were very well kept.
Good buffet option but also a surprisingly good value!. . Went during weekday lunch for 22.99/person and was very pleased. Although the selection was poor in certain aspects (for sushi there were only california rolls and one spicy tuna roll), I was very happy with the overall quality consistency of choices. The heavier meat cuts including the St Louis pork ribs, brisket, and flank steak were all very solid. Even the Asian foods (from the perspective of this Asian) were very tasty. Interestingly, many breakfast foods were still available well into lunch hours, including an omelette station if that's your thing. Finally, it looks like they put out the full desserts repertoire for lunch, which includes awesome sugar-free options that are just as tasty as their guiltier counterparts.. . If you are looking for a Vegas buffet that will make you happy without breaking the bank, the buffet at bellagio is a great option!
Yummy!  Wish they had crablegs at lunch and a better dessert selection but a great value and better tasting food than Wicked Spoon.
Terrible, terrible! All the food tasted the same. Huge disappointment after so many nice meals at this hotel. Yelpers skip the buffet and save yourself the wait in line
This review is for 8/18/14 lunch time. This was to be our last buffet before we headed back home from our vacation. We had decided to save a good one for the end and we were disappointed. Lunch for 2 people $50 and it was slim pickings, they still had breakfast out in 2 stations and when we were leaving they still had breakfast out. Not a big variety of items, the lay out reminds me of the planet Hollywood buffet, nothing exciting that would knock your socks off. The food was warm some items were a hit and miss, the dessert station was disappointing. Best thing I ate was the turkey and brisket, the flank steak was way too bloody. Will I go back? No, not for that price.
This place was packed, but I didn't enjoy the eating experience. It's dimly lit with no windows. The old decor and dead ambiance made it feel like any run-of-the-mill buffet.. The food was okay, but not as good as a regular restaurant. I might try a buffet at another restaurant next time
I've heard about the famous Bellagio Buffet since I was little. Yay finally tried it for lunch. It was a fair price ($25) per person to indulge in a variety of food. They have breakfast foods, Italian, Asian, pizza, burgers, salad, sushi, lox, herring (a personal favorite) and much much more. I assumed it would be more extravagant but I think the lobstah shows up during dinner. There was shrimp at lunch though. I tried a little bit of everything and this is what made me happy: lox, herring, trout, spicy tuna hand rolls, flank steak, polenta, mussels, pizza, salad and desserts. I would absolutely return again for more foood! P.S. I couldn't eat till midnight that day because I was so stuffed!
Boyfriend and I came here for dinner. Long wait in line but it was worth it. Variety of different food such as: steaks, crab legs, Asian, Italian and the deserts were too die for. The con's were that they didn't have lobster. Staff were very friendly as well. After dinner we watched the water fountain show in front of the hotel and it was so beautiful. Glad I got to experience this finally. ..
In my opinion, the Buffet at the Bellagio is the best one on the strip. I've eaten at the MGM, Mandalay Bay, the Excalibur, Caesars Palace, etc. and this place is at the top of my list. . . PRICES & THE WAIT: it's a bit on the pricey side ($25+) however it is all worth it. Caesar's Palace Bacchanal buffet was about $53 for dinner time and I really regret ever spending that much money on a buffet; the foodwas a huge disappointment and I wished I used that money here that night. Even when I went to the Bellagio buffet during the holidays, it costed less than that (~$45). The wait kind of varies on the time you go. For dinner you may have to wait 20-30min but I personally don't mind since it's my favorite. . . SERVICE: I have never dealt with a rude hostess/waiter/waitress here, so I dont have much to say except that they do their job the way they should. Once, when this  impatient couple was getting mad in line because of the VIP MLife members (they didn't understand how it works), the hostess talked to them in a calm fashion while they were complaining. impressive.. . FOOD: the food is to die for. They have a sushi bar that serves tuna and salmon poke! SWEEEET! And if you're lucky, maybe they will have steak tartar. I'm not a huge fan of that but I thought it was a cool food option to have. During the holidays they even had caviar! FANCY! Anyway, they also have a tastey Italian section, Asian section, pizza section... Everything is just so delicious. Some of the foods that really caught my attention and taste buds were the smoked salmon, pesto mashed potatoes and tortellini, and their tiramisu. If you're on a diet, don't hold back and please take a cheat day for this place. The food is AWESOME. . Overall, I am always satisfied and 5lbs heavier after I leave the Buffet at the Bellagio. I make sure to hit it up every time I am in Vegas and you should too. Skip the other over priced buffets and come here to get your money's worth!
OK. It's a giant buffet. What I liked about it (other than the waiting in line, which is not so fun) is that it has many healthy choices amidst the usual fare.
Reminded me of a large Sizzler. Totally lacking in food taste and presentation. The buffets at Wynn and M Resort are much better. . . Shame because the rest of what Bellagio has to offer is top notch.
good food, and silver cutlery - quite a good buffet, but not the best. . . For the price, I'd eat elsewhere...
Came here on Friday night. After a long drive from San Diego we were starving.  There was no line which was great!. . I have eaten here a couple years ago and remembered it was delicious. I was very disappointed this time around. The crab legs and cocktail shrimps were frozen cold. The fish was dry and had no flavor. I am a big desert fan and they did not have a great selection of choices.. . The waitress who was serving us was very unprofessional.  She was cleaning the table next to us and was talking crap (very loudly) about the amount of tip the previous people left. I couldn't believe it! She not only did it once, but twice.  . . I would not come back. Definitely not worth it.
Way overhyped . The only good thing they had was sushi . The crab legs were dry and way over cooked so they lost all flavor. Everything else was mediocre at best . Excalibur and Fremont got lot better buffets then this one for a lot less cost .  Avoid at all cost .
