We love Heather!
Came here for my birthday with my wife and some friends. All the photos of the food made me crazy hungry so we could not resist.. . Place looks like it could have been an old post office in another lifetime. Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.. . Started with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not tryis the question. There are so many choices.. . Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.. . We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!. . Recommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.. . Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.. . Definitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations. SALUTE!. . 4.25 STARS
Great atmosphere and even better food. Order bruschetta (obviously) and make sure you get at least one prosciutto and fig in your flight! The Italian Picnic salad is amazing- goat cheese... bacon... I mean what more could you want?! The only downside is you're almost forced to use valet parking. Pretty annoying but hey, what can you do? Carry a couple bucks on you for the valet.
I LOVE Postino. I come here often with my girlfriends for lunch or bring my our of town friends for a nice hangout, $5 glass of wine at lunch and brochette to die for. Really, the best lunch in town. . . Service is always on top of it and friendly. Really outstanding. . . My one note was my last experience - I came in Saturday and had a very unpleasant experience with the valet manager -  Logan. He was being so rude and short with us we almost left ! All we asked was - since when they block all the spot when you turn in to Postino Arcadia as it used to be available to self part. . If this was my first time coming to Postino - I probably would have... It was still great once we went it. As always is :-)
Favorite resturant in Phoenix!
Great neighborhood joint can't beat the bruschetta and a cold brew to relax and unwind.
LOVE this place. The food is always fantastic! Try the bruschetta board for sure, and usually the seasonal option is great. We went there last night and the service is simply amazing. My water was full the entire time I was there and the food came out very quickly. We arrived around 6pm and they were decently busy, but we didn't wait for a table which is nice. We have been to the Monday/Tuesday 8pm special before and that gets extremely busy. Make sure you arrive a little before 8 and you will probably wait a bit for a table but it's worth it! A board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that anywhere! Maybe one of the best aspects of this restaurant is that they do not upcharge bottles of wine 90% like many others do. The bottle is 3x the glass price, pretty great if you ask me!
It is amazing for happy hour. Decent prices, great atmosphere.
Love the name, makes me think if Il Postino, or Positano when looking quickly, both great Italian things.. . Followed the rave reviews to here, from Yelp and word of mouth. Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer. Would like to give it another shot some other time, but probably wouldn't wait in line to do so.
Stopped by when they first opened and wasn't very impressed. I'll admit I haven't been back for a second try, but here is the first experience:. . It wasn't crowded and service was extremely slow, staff seemed to be more interested in their own conversations than serving guests. Food was okay, nothing fantastic, portions were small and price was large. . . I'm not quite sure what all the hype has been about this place, but I might give it one more try before I totally write it off.
The butcher's block is always my go to. I sub the hummus for extra ricotta and soft baguette for the hard crispy toasts and it's fantastic every time.
Postino has been a long time favorite of mine.  Upward Projects has done many wonderful things since Postino - but they will always be my favorite.  The food is delicious and fresh, the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting.  $5 glasses of wine from 11 to 5p - what an amazing way to try a new flavor :)  Thank you again Positno for being my favorite place.
I had the best bruschetta here. . . The drinks were good and refreshing.. . The sandwiches and salad were fresh and delicious. The place looks like a bar but comfy and big. Service was quick and patient. . . Again, bruschetta not to miss
Love this place in our neighborhood! food are very healthy and delicious. We normally order bruchetta with figs and prosciutto.
Refreshing change from Scottsdale prices, over-the-top complexity and congestion. . . Uber simple, almost plain-Jane, decor is misleading. Nice wine list, tho light on French wines. Nice beer list. . . Mix and match menu with reasonable prices complementary valet parking. . . AND, $5 wine before 5 PM each day. . . I'd be inclined to try their weekend brunch it time permits some trip. . . I'll come back for sure.
Hands down my favorite restaurant in the valley. I typically go to the Gilbert location as I feel it's the largest but had brunch at this location on Sunday. The bruschetta is an absolute must whether you are there for dinner or weekend brunch. They have $5 mimosas and bellinis which are equally delicious, and a large wine selection. I have never had anything bad from the menu here!
This place is amazing! They have amazing food.. Love the Bruschetta plate. It's very filling and great for 2! Make it an evening, enjoy some wine, very cool place to hang out!
The food here is great. I have tried nearly ever type of bruschetta and haven't been disappointed- favorites include the tomato jam, salmon, and prosciutto fig. Also the chicken and mozzarella panini is one of my favorite sandwiches ever. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service- sometimes it's good and sometimes it's just meh... Regardless, we keep going back for the delicious food.
Monday and Tuesday Bruschetta and Wine deals are where it's at!! Bruschetta is always on point!!
Always a good idea to go here. You can't miss. Great vibe, great food and great wine.
Fantastic food, excellent wine, great atmosphere. Whats not to love here? Excellent for romantic dates, or just a social gathering of friends.
Brunch is until 1pm. Scrambled eggs and bacon is very good!
Salami and Pesto Bruschetta is awesome. I like going during the week like Wednesday because its a little less hectic. Love it but Postino's gets mad crowded.  If you go for Sunday Brunch send someone ahead to get the table it will prevent angry hungry friends.
Yum!  So good, great service and food came quickly despite being really busy during lunch.  We loved it!  Salads are great and you can't miss the bruschetta!
Any opinion I could possibly have developed on Postino would just be a reiteration of something that's already been said several times already below, so I'll just add my vote in favor of this place.. . Delivers the hype *drops mic.*
the place is nice very hipster food  ok nothing to write home about needs a better beer selction with some more euro stuff
