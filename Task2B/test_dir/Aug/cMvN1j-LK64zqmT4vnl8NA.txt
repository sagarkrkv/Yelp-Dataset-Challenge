Got charged an EXTRA 20.00 to my card last night!!! Make sure you save your receipt .....also very $$$$.... We left hungry
Was expecting a good lunch, but had an awesome lunch. Food was excellent, loved loved the margarita with salt air foam. Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas. Chinese and Mexican the perfect hang over food all in the same place, what's not to love.
This place is pretty awesome.  They had a killer tuna tartare type dish, some pretty good stir fried noodles, and some great guac (although IMO they added a bit to much sriracha or some other Asian chile type sauce to try and make it taste different than regular guac).  Pork buns were decent but a little doughy for my taste.  Really good margs with whipped salt.. . Docking a star because the raw oyster served on top of the wagyu beef taco was nearly inedible---super fishy.
i've always had great experiences at this place. great food, great service. I dont like sitting on the little stool thing but i can easily get over that. . . we went there for my fiance's birthday, we has tacos, pozole, a couple orders of dim sum, noodles and a couple of deserts.. . He ordered a Manhattan, which sat in the window a bit to long so he was a little disappointing but it wasn't a huge deal.. . all in all we were very happy with the experience and will be returning soon!
I had the 20 vegetable fried rice and a taco here along with some wine.. . The twenty vegetable fried rice was amazing. I opted for the in house made chili oil. Quality meal. There was a nice balance of rice and vegetables. Wow was it good.. . The tacos was good, but pricey. I'm accustomed to two tacos per order, not one.. . Overall a quality meal for a fair price given the venue.
While staying  at the cosmopolitan I was lucky enough to have easy access to China poblano. My first meal consisted of " when pigs fly" and " golden pigs". The golden pigs were awesome. They had sweet tender pork filling with a hint of 5 spice ( I think) and came with house made sweetened condensed milk which was delish. There at 4 to a serving..but they are filling. The when pigs fly were the same filling..only these were steamed..not fried golden..and came with no dipping sauce. I was pleased..but would have liked a dip!  Second trip I ordered the 18 monk noodle.. And took it to go since I was solo..I guess it was because I took it up to my room..but the noodles were a bit dry..and the portion was a tad bit small. One stand out that I had both times were the pork carnitas tacos. The filling was super juicy and came with two chicharones inside. I could have eaten 10.
Ugh. DMV residents can't even get away from Jose Andres in Las Vegas.  But oh well - we decided to give it a try.  We were most definitely not going to eat at Jaleo since you can throw a rock out the Washington Monument and hit one.  China Poblano was to be our JA experience at the Cosmopolitan.  . . The restaurant is on the small side, but, as all of JA's restaurants, colorfully decorated.  We got When Pigs Fly, which are the more traditional steam Chinese buns and not the type of buns you would expect from a ramen house, for example.  Vietnamese also eat these type of buns - ban bao - usually filled with an egg and meat.  These buns were just ok, but not what i wanted or expected.  I got the fish tacos, which were just seared fish with marinated onions.  They left something to be desired.  The BF got the Queso Fundido, which was the best thing we had.  It was melted Menonita cheese, tequila and he added chorizo.  The tortillas were warm and tasted oh so gooey and ooey once we tore the tortillas up and dug into the melted yummy-ness.  . . China Poblano was good, but like a typical Jose Andres restaurant, a mixture of Spanish and Asian spices and tastes, where some of the dishes are a standout and the rest are just fillers. There are just so many other places to go on the Strip, might as well skip this one unless you are staying in the Cosmo and need a quick bite.
It is a pretty restaurant, but the good is disgusting. They don't have what is Chinese food.
Two words: overpriced, yuck. Not great food. Cocktails are fine. Just not really my cup of tea. The Mexican food is not good at all. Chinese food items we ordered were much better! We are from tx after all--and this Mexican food is super nasty. Do not even step into this place if you're looking for good food. You won't find it here.. . Overall: wouldn't ever step foot back in this place unless my veggie fried rice was free. Pretty disgusting.
Loved the food....and loved the service.  Was floored be the small portions & price.  Tiny tacos were $5 each and a small plate of fish nibbles on a bed of crispy noodles was $48!  Drinks were $15 each.  Again, yummy, but very very overpriced.  My guy and I spent nearly $150 for shared meal and needed to get fast food for diner later.  Sad.  If you want mini, yummy, meals....and money is no object....this is the place.. I recommend you try the salty foam Margaritas.  Again, yummy, and tiny.
My wife and I were seated by the hostess and literally as we were sitting down an angry lady stormed over and said our spot is a reserved spot. We looked back for the hostess, who was long gone and the angry lady basically said can't sit here so get out of here. We had to chase down a hostess who eventually put us back in the same spot.It was weird, embarrassing and rude. . . The food was very small portions and expensive for what it is. With all the good restaurants around, choose another.
I really wanted to like this place because we were starving and seriously craving some Asian noodles after a night of drinking. We came down here to eat after we couldn't handle Marquee Day Club anymore.. . The three of us ordered the dan dan mien, wonton noodle soup and the beef lettuce dish to share. My favorite was the beef lettuce dish, only because the other two were  disappointing. Portions were pretty small overall, sadly. I really wanted soup, and the broth in the noodle soup was bland, but the wontons were yummy! There were barely any egg noodles.. . The chewiness of the dan dan mien was perfect though! And the service was exceptional too. I also enjoyed the restaurant decor because it was really fun and cute, and loved the wallpaper and Asian style decorations.. . The food is OK, pretty overpriced, but the restaurant is fun and the service is great. It's really a toss up since this seems to be one of the only Asian restaurants at the Cosmopolitan.
Maybe because we are Asian and we love Mexican food, this place was perfection for us! We had a party of 14 (including 8 children, ages 3-12) with a show to catch in one hour, and everyone was very attentive from the hostess to our waiter, and we even knocked down two glasses of water during our meal. Just down right excellent service. And the food...!! Amazing! Hand made noodles with a twist of Mexican and Chinese  flavors incorporated into the dishes... just wow.
The Bistec Con Mole, Pescado a la Plancha taco, and MOST of all, the whimsical and expert bartender Sarah were absolutely first class and exceptionally unique.  What a surprise for anyone who values a little magic in their food as well as their drink. Just go. You will be surprised.
Have you ever had to eat trash and have to pay for it ? Well this is the spot if you know Mexican food or Born Mexican you will know the food here is horrible by just looking at the prices. The food is pathetic the prices are insane 15 dollars for chips and guacamole come on man . Who spends 5 dollars on a "gourmet" taco it should be gourtrash it's nothing special please do not step in here I should've went to the Golden Arches and had a gourmet Big Mac
A 'small plate' Mexican x Chinese fusion Restaraunt - a weird combination that Doesn't really work. Stopped here in an evening to get a quick meal. Staff were friendly and helpful and the decor was bright and vibrant. The food was OK, but for me the foods from the two countries don't work together and when you add the small plate format to that, then it was confused and un-satisfying -  the fact it is not cheap meant it was a bit disappointing.
I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/
I don't understand why this place has bad review! This is a wonderful place. The food is delicious and the price is not that bad. Matter in fact it's just right for the food quality. The dessert was just as delicious my server was amazing best than most I see in any other restaurant. The cocktails were a pleasure. I loved this place so much I couldn't stop eating! I kept getting more food and trying to eat more. In all my experience was wonderful and I can't wait to bring more family and friends to try this place out.
No. No. No. Asian food is blan or just a bunch of soy sauce.. They charge for hot sauce.. they charge for salsa refill and chips.. not worth it. Epic fail. Found hair in our complimentary wontons that we got because our food was late. Fyi. Seating in the outside by the entrance is uncomfortable
