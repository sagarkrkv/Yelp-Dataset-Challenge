I love the MGM. My friends always say "why do you always stay there"?  I have been staying at the MGM for years and see no reason to go anywhere else in Vegas! They offer everything free to me as an M-Life member and I don't usually take a lot of money with me. I'm certainly not a high roller! I usually go 3 or 4 times a year and I have actually come home a winner several times! The choices of restaurants are outstanding. The place is large enough to never become boring, and I have always received outstanding service. My only complaint might be the lack of drink service when playing slots. Other than that it's a great get away and all I budget for is my gambling stash and with any luck I may take it back home with me!
Well, if you don't mind drunk, twenty-something idiots all over the place, then stay at the MGM Grand. We stayed here 8/2 for one night because of a long road trip and won't come back. Too crowded, too much smoke, and a bad mix of high-end resort meets spring break crowd. We have stayed at other hotels and had better experiences. If you have a young family, another hotel would be a wise choice.. . A form letter?!? Great service from the MGM. The hotel needs to improve its management of young drinkers. We saw young drunks stumble and fall into the pool! Cutting down on the food court restaurants could ease congestion and improve traffic flow inside the hotel. We spoke to several employees who said the "Wet Republic" drunk partiers created huge problems for them.
This is my first time staying at the MGM and most likely the last. I'm use to staying at the Venetian suite. I'm very disappointed with the time spent in line at the check in desk, the rooms are standard but clean and  the pool area is to far from my room.  Whats funny about that is concierge  said we have a pool view. Lol what a joke that was. Every one looked like ants. And that's not all my resorts fees are 56 dollars a day on top of the price I already paid for rooms $$$.Oh yeah they gave us a 50 dollars dinning credit a day. But if you add the resort fees I have really payed for my own dinning credit. I gave it two stars only because the.  room was clean.At this point I'm not a very happy customer.
This place has changed over the years for sure. I stayed for the weekend 7/25/14 and I was not impressed. Customer service was terrible and everything now looks old and cheap. I'm shocked we paid that much for a room that was very simple and plain. They don't even have the lions anymore! If I'm going to be spending that much money I'd rather stay at one of the newer hotels!
When it comes to Vegas, always remember: You get what you pay for. . . MGM has recently done renovations, and the rooms and hallways look great. They are very much up to "Vegas standards". . . However, MGM was originally opened in 1993, so some items that aren't cosmetic haven't been upgraded:. . 1) Such as the ventilation in the casino and rooms. MGM is very smokey and you will notice it in your hair/clothing. Also, the AC in our room took a LONG time to cool the room down. . . 2) The shower was a little wonky as well. The faucet would run while the shower was running, and the water had the potential to get extremely hot.  . . PMGM is cheaper than other hotels, so it's a good choice for someone on a budget who would still like to be on the strip. . . What I did like: . .  1) Having an M Life card. It's free to sign up and allowed us to get a discount on Zumanity tickets. (The price dropped from $115 to $75/person!) . A lot of hotels don't offer discounts to their guests when booking through the concierge, so that was great. . This card also gives you a discount at the small convenient store in the lobby. . . 2) The pool area is very nice. There is more than one pool available and extras like a volleyball net and inner tubes are available for free. The chairs are comfortable and there are lots available. . . 3) The cafeteria. Dining on a budget? McDonald's and Nathans are some of the fast food available. They also have a Starbucks in the casino. . . 4) MGM is located on a busy part of the strip. There are lots of shops and other hotels to walk to from MGM. . . Overall, a nice hotel worth 3.5 stars.
When I go to Vegas, this is where I stay.  Thanks to the comps that I got, I've been able to stay at this resort for free for the past three years.  Thanks MGM for always making my stays there memorable.   See ya in November.
This is the worst hotel I have ever been to. Check in to the hotel wasn't easy. We had to wait in the line for about 2 hours and a half and after all that we got to our room that was dirty from the previous guests, so disgusting! VERY RUDE STAFF AND GUEST SERVICE! My husband was playing blackjack tables he asked for a bottle water it took forever. And when the server got there he wasn't playing at the moment so she was like I can't serve u! You're not playing! And he had already lost $400. Above all that these people are crooks they will steal your money. I was over charged And I had to call 2 3 and 4 times and waste my time just to get my money back! In other words we had a terrible experience at this hotel and will never ever go back here! the first and last time :(
I came in at 11:30 am to MGM try to check in at the V.I.P registry.., system is down and it's crazy the waiting time to get your reserved room.. . It's 5:12pm and have not checked in yet. Not koo
Writing regarding my recent stay 8/1-8/3.  While the hotel is very beautiful I would NOT recommend staying here.  We drove in from Phoenix to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We chose MGM Grand specifically for the lazy river, needing some chill time.  Although nothing like the one in the Bahamas, it sounded like a relaxing time.  . . Disappointment #1:  Upon arrival we noticed that someone had broken a glass and it was not cleaned up properly.  The bathroom and vanity area had multiple pieces of glass, small and nickel size pieces.  Called housekeeping and a gentleman "swept" a little. Off we go to enjoy Vegas.  When we returned, we noticed still more glass and figured we'd walk around our room with flip flops until it could be cleaned in the AM.  I was mistaken.  Housekeeper #2 also missed it.  We gave up and just decided to just walk around in our flip flops and agreed not to stay at MGM Grand again.. . Disappointment #2:  Was very disappointed, after paying $16 for tube rental we went around the river once and returned our tubes for a refund.  Lazy river is more like a social hangout for groups and the tubes are and after thought.  Too many people standing around in the pool we couldn't get around the river without bumping into a lot of people.  These weren't small groups, most were 5-10 people just standing on side of pool.. . These disappointments did not prevent us from enjoying our anniversary.  We just agreed that MGM was a bad choice and hung out at other casinos and only slept here (bed was comfortable) .  Lessons learned...stick to what you know...much better experience at other strip hotels!
I would give this hotel a 4.5, but leaning more towards a 4 for a couple of reasons. . However, this is now my favorite hotel on the strip. The hotel has so much to offer. It is also a very family-friendly hotel. Most other hotels on the strip have nightlife inside the casino you must pass to get to your room, but this one seemed to be contained inside a club, which was very nice to see. . When we booked the hotel, we got $25 dining credit per night. I called concierge the day I checked in and was told I could use the credit all at once and they would cover the $75 ($25 for 3 nights) at the end of my stay. The person I talked to didn't sound confident in the answer so I called back on my 2nd night before I used the credit. I called concierge again, but the ENTIRE system was down so when they tried calling the front desk to get the answer for me they told me to go down to a specific desk. Since the system was down, that line was ridiculously long so we went to the bell desk to ask. They didn't know so they called the front desk and told me he was unsure if we would get the credit in full or if it reset every night, but he assumed so. So we went to use the credit at Cabana Grill, and after waiting 15 minutes in line, learned that we couldn't charge to the room because the system was still down. No one could check in or charge to the room. We had specific plans so this was the last time we had time to use it. Luckily we didn't, because we went down that night to see what we could do about the credit we couldn't use and learned it didn't rollover so it was only $25 a night, for 3 nights, not $75 total. We were not offered any credit, they told us it was over with and basically "oh well, too bad.". Tip: The credit does not rollover!!!! There is not very good customer service when it comes to these kind of comps. . We were checked in within minutes. Almost every window, if not every window, was open. While the system was down, the line was incredibly long, but they were taking care of people. They were handing out waters on trays, etc. . There was a walk from the parking structure to the lobby and rooms, but it wasn't bad. . They have an amazing pool area. There are several pools to choose from, including a lazy river, which leads off to a mini pool with a waterfall. The lazy river was a hangout spot, but it didn't really make a difference. There is also a food court with an amazing chicken place, casual restaurants, and multiple specialty restaurants. They also have a good buffet.. The housekeeping and customer care was amazing! We called for extra towels and got it almost immediately. We then got a call from someone making sure we got our towels and seeing if we needed anything else. Usually it takes hours to get towels or we have to call again. The staff was also friendly when we had a question and directed us to the right people, calling them from their desk and allowing us to talk to them, rather than asking for us or giving us a long number to call.. The hotel grounds are very nice. The room was clean, the casino didn't smell like smoke, and it looked nice overall. They also had a variety of sports in a large sports area that offered food and drinks. There were some kids in this area, so I'm assuming it was a family-friendly area, which was nice. They didn't limit their televisions to one or two sports, which was fantastic to see!. The security in the hotel is also better than other hotels. They had a main lobby and then two separate areas. Those two towers had secured doors you needed to open with a key to access elevators and rooms. . The wifi was actually free and it worked at NYNY, as well. As a guest, you get 4 devices for 48 hours. . Overall, the rooms were nice, the staff was friendly (except when dealing with comps) and I enjoyed being on resort property. . As a warning, they do charge the "hold" for the room and then say they will reverse the charge 3 days after check-out. Most just hold it and then release the hold upon checkout, so I found that a little strange.. The hotel is also very wheelchair friendly. The beds are a little high in the accessible rooms, but that was the only complaint when it came to the rooms.
The pool was great!!! The hotel was very large and we did a lot of walking in the hotel to find stuff. . The room on the other hand was horrible! When we arrived the room smelled like smoke (we were on a on smoking floor) the bathroom sink backed up, the lights you could dim in the room but every 10-20 mins they will be bright for a few and then dim again. The room was dirty!! Even after house keeping cleaned it still was dirty. Old dust and marks along the window. I wouldn't stay here again even though the pool was great.
I did not stay at this hotel and probably never will because of the layout. The sign directories are pretty worthless, especially if you are trying to find the monorail. This casino truly seems to try to keep you lost in the casino so you end up spending money. With no signs as towhere the monorail is it took me almost 40min to locate it. There are better casinos to stay at.
My first trip to stay at MGM Grand was so full of disappointment we left after a few hours.  Long queue to register, our room given to someone else so we got downgrade in bed size with no upgrade in room, rowdy guests, near brawl in elevator over it being too full, elevator door attempted to close 3 times as a malfunction coming and going, room AC did not cool room, room fan not available or given upon multiple requests.  When we considered walking through to the pool we opted to just leave due to crowds.  After checkout we stored bags and went to event.  This was ok but at end of concert they closed bathrooms in order to shoo us all like cattle through the venue exit doors.  Appalling to not let patrons use the bathroom at end of concert!  We walked out in tiny cross legged baby steps grateful to be making our exit.
Enjoyed this hotel and Casino. It is quite large and while the buffet is small, there was no wait and the food was spectacular.
Awesome the buffet is a little pricey but good and the rain Forest Cafe is awesome very good the beds are supersoft and clean no bedbugs and the concierge was very helpful and we got checked in right away even though we had A late flight
Very enjoyable stay at the MGM Grand. What was so great about it you ask? For one a nice large room. Very modern with a wall of mirrors and beautiful art work. I wish I could have taken that art with me.. . A large modern bathroom with marble flooring and shower tiles. Semi-private commode. The shower has a raindrop shower head which isn't my favorite but the water was hot enough. Just wish there was handheld shower head with more power.. . In the bathroom plenty of towels and wash clothes. I was not at all impressed with the soaps however. The soaps and shampoos provided were not luxurious and had virtually no smell. And speaking of soaps once you used them the housekeeping staff did not refill them. Odd. I spotted a house keeper in the hall and asked for more. She loaded me up with them. . . One of the most genius things was the open ended toilet paper holder. Why didn't they think of this sooner? One end of the toilet paper dispenser is left free so the refilling is a snap. I have got to look for one those for my bathroom.. . The bed was very comfortable with few exceptions. The pillows were large and surprising heavy. I've never encountered that in a pillow before. They were cumbersome to move around. Concerning the sheets I was reminded of a Seinfeld episode in which George did not want the corners tucked. The sheets were tucked so tightly I could not move my feet. A serving tray sits on the foot of bed and makes a great snack table for drunken feasts in the middle of the night.. . Yes of course there is free wifi available on up to 4 devices (i think). There are two options of wifi available. One being free and the other a turbo charged version is I believe $50 per day so be very careful to select the free option. Once connected wifi is available through out the hotel.. . A very nice work station sits in front of a mirrored wall. A large picture window includes two type of powered shades. Light diffusing and black out. Took me a minute to figure out how to use that but it was a nice feature. I opted for light diffusing. You can still see out but it blocks harsh light. Blackout, well you know what that is.. . There is a mini bar in the room and naturally it consists of overpriced items. I'm not sure if certain rooms come with more mini bar options but there was a list of items on the menu that i did not see in my room. Perhaps you had to call up for them. Who knows?. . Be forewarned. Don't think you can eat some $8 pringles and then replace them with a 99 cent version from the local Walmart or whatever the equivalent is in Vegas. As soon as you pick an item up off the tray you will be charged. Even if you just pick it up and replace it.. . What is there to do at MGM Grand? So, so much. Eat of course. There is a food court and if you go you'll want to stop at the place that makes the crepes. there's also a McDonalds if you want to watch your budget.. . For finer dining check out Emeril's, Joel Rubochon, Tom Collichio's or Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. I've heard tell there is a buffet at the Grand. In fact I was there years before but this time around I did not see/find it. So i'm not sure if it's still there.. . You may also want to check out Wet Republic the pool/night club. And speaking of nightclubs do stop into Rouge it's fantastic! If you are bored you can also do the CSI game/tour where you try and solve a crime CSI style.. . Naturally there is gaming and lots of it. There's a pretty large casino and while smoking is allowed there is a lovely fragrance piped in which does nicely to drown out the smell of cigarettes unless of course you happen to be near someone smoking.. . The hotel is very large but surprisingly easy to navigate. I didn't get lost once.. . The Grand is a bit far down the strip within walking distance is Excalibur which has an indoor walkway that will take you the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. To venture further down the strip you may want to purchase a daily pass for the Deuce. The Vegas Strip Bus. An all day pass is only $8 and it runs approximately every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.. . There is a system for hailing a car or taxi but much like check-in there is often a long line. I caught a taxi several times before I wised up and learned of the bus. It seems there is no such thing as a taxi ride under $20 in Vegas.
The suites are nice and although the lines are long it moves fast. The check in person we got had no personality which sucked...but I have to say thanks as we missed our flight so came a day later and they still accepted our online booking. What I disliked the most about gambling here was that every time I lit a cigarette at a smoking table, the pit managers would come by and make a rude comment. Such as " hey [dealer name] do you smoke?" She said no he turns back and says looking directly at me "well you do now".... And similar remarks were made such as" that smells disgusting how can you do that" ??!!!???!!! Had I known MGM was so anti smoking I would've gladly gambled elsewhere!!! It's a nice hotel so I'll give it 3 stars but I've never encountered such rude floor managers in Vegas!
I once spent five consecutive days inside of the MGM Grand without ever leaving the premises AND I enjoyed every bit of it! Impressive, right?! (I am not a hermit, this place seriously just has it all!). . I've had many business trips to Vegas (40+ days in Vegas last year) and MGM definitely is on my top hotel list. Why? It has everything I could ever want. The rooms are modern, comfortable, clean, and spacious. Wifi, great TV, and the cardio room are all included in the resort fee. While these aren't necessary for a crazy Vegas time, they definitely make the stay more comfortable. . . What really makes this place top-notch is the variety of dining and entertainment. . . There is an excellent combination of restaurants- everything from fast food and pizza to top-rated restaurants. It was great! I was able to save some cash on breakfast and lunch so I had more money for the fun stuff. As for entertainment, there are shows, a beautiful pool, places to drink, gamble, and the kind of people watching only Vegas could offer.. . The hotel has a very young and fun feeling. If I was bringing a bunch of friends out,  MGM Grand would be my top choice. My stay was excellent.
We had an enjoyable stay at the MGM Grand Hotel.  The rooms are very nice, modern, and comfortable.  We didn't have any issues while we were there at all, and the staff was very friendly.. . The only negative was that (I agree with another reviewer on this) it is a VERY big hotel.  It took us about 15 minutes to get to our room each time we entered the building.  . . The pool area is phenomenal.  There are several pools to choose from, with the lazy river being the highlight.  If you want a tube though, you will have to pay $16.  If you are staying for more than a couple days, I recommend just buying the smaller tubes that they have for purchase.  They are a couple bucks cheaper, and you can keep them and use them every time you go to the pool.. . I was a little bit disappointed that the lions weren't there anymore!  Last time I was in Vegas, that was such a fun highlight for me!  They do have a lot of other entertainment on site though.  If I had more time (and if tickets were a bit cheaper), I would have loved to see David Copperfield's show!  . . Overall, the pros far outweighed the cons for our stay and I would recommend this hotel.
People aren't kidding when they say its a massive hotel. I think I finally figured out how to get around on my last day there. . . The best part of this hotel is the pool, hands down. Easily the best pool of all the hotels I've stayed at on the strip. I'm a sucker for lazy rivers. One of the days we were there they shut down the lazy river due to someone getting sick I'm guessing but nbd we just went to one of the many other pools. Tip: go early if you want a good spot.. . I've docked one star for the overall room. It was nice but I think I've gotten so accustomed to the beautiful rooms bathrooms in some of the other resorts that this one was a disappointment. It's got nothing on the ones in hotels like the Cosmo or the Venetian. . . And one star gets docked for the service. There were two days that we were there for the whole day and our room was cleaned once and that too at 5 pm. And we were in the room at the time so it was basically just a replenishing of the towels. Not a huge deal but it was weird that we'd come back from the pool and there wasn't any fresh towels.. . Overall, not a bad place. Good location, especially with the newer clubs like Hakkasan and Marquee in the area. My favorites are on the other end of the Strip but that made for some interesting walks. I personally probably wouldn't be back though, I've stayed at places that left more of an impression.
I had a very unpleasant stay! I checked in August 5 and I booked my hotel through hotels.com. My overall stay is 167 including tax which is great for 2 days but when we came to the front desk MGM charge me for 256!!!! For deposit and resort fee which is ridiculous! You charge me guys more than my stay??!!! Doesn't make any sense at all! On top of that the room I had the cable off and it took them an hour and 30 to come by and fix it?? Wow! there's your customer service. I hope they refund my money already up until now I still don't have the money in my account for 200 it's been like 7 days and the gal I spoke to said it's 4-7 business days. Never going back here they lost 1 customer by doing this. I hope this one helps for other guys planning to stay at Mgm
My fiancee (now husband ;)) and I got married at the MGM Grand on May 4, 2014.... Which was a Sunday and just so happened to be the day after the Mayweather fight.  FINE.  . . We got to the hotel Sunday morning at 11am and requested an early checkin as we booked one of the 16 penthouses for our ceremony and reception.  The gentleman was very nice and stated that he could probably get us in around 1PM.  Great!  He called housekeeping to ensure there was an open room that could be cleaned as a rush.  He indicated he had our numbers and would call by 2 pm.  NEVER HAPPENED.  Since 3 pm is the POSTED check in, I thought for sure we would get the call be 3.  NOT.    We went back to the hotel at 3:30 to inquire about our room and the desk said the room was still not ready.  We FINALLY got the call at 4:12PM that our room was ready--- then came the 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive from the bell desk.  Ceremony was set to begin at 6:30... Needless to say we had to postpone the ceremony by 30 minutes. FINE.. . The room was gorgeous for our intimate ceremony and reception--- I highly recommend it for a non-traditional wedding or2nd wedding.  The skyline is EPIC AT SUNSET!!. . That being said, I was disappointed when the doorbell rang at 8:30AM the next morning.  SERIOUS?  Check out is 10 AM.... Who the hell rings a doorbell that early in the am in Vegas. And they were back again at 9:30.  SHIT. WAIT TILL THE CHECK OUT TIME BEFORE RINGING DOORBELLS!. . The ONLY reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the space was perfect for our occasion and when we called for housekeeping, they also brought up additional paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags.  Other than that, the check in service was NOT acceptable... Over an hour late and an add'l hour for luggage. Then the early disturbance in the AM.. . Shame shame MGM. I know you made your $$ the night before with all the boxing fans but a little appreciation for the little guys would have been nice.
Their service staff (house keeping, servers, front desk etc) are friendly, helpful and fast. Thank you all for your excellent service!
I remember MGM Grand as one of the best hotel/casinos on the strip, and now it's just, ugh, or eh.  Their buffet is horrific and their casino had this horrible vanilla smell mixed with like tobacco, just wasn't a good look.  I won't even mention the crowds just because I understand, it's Vegas in the middle of the afternoon, whatever.  My husband and I literally waited for our car at valet for as long as we spent eating at their buffet, but the valet attendant was very sweet, so 1 star for him. I just don't know what happened to this place.
This is my second stay in MGM and loved and sure will come back! Love the river pool that they have! And room even the cheapest rooms are in luxury futuristic style even small rooms are nice to enjoy ur stay!
I enjoyed my stay here at the MGM.  Check in was easy and prompt.  Most of the staff are very friendly and smile and say hello to you in the halls.  The rooms are very nice, clean, and modern, oh wait except for the 2 bloody booger smears that it looked as though someone had been jumping on the bed and smeared on the ceiling, like my brother used to do at home. Gross! I made sure not look at the ceiling or else I would start gagging.  I love the blackout shades.  I also really liked Michael Minas Pub.  I planned on doing all my day drinking there and having lunch there again, but unfortunately they dont open till 5pm on weekdays.  I tried the Tap Room, and their food was really good, but unfortunately they didnt offer much on tap. They probably had between 10-15 beers and I wish there was more than just the 3 standard ipa's that everybody else had as well.  Damn it Michael Minas why cant you open earlier!!!  I ended up taking my day drinking business to another hotel that had a pub with a large draught list and good variety as well as happpy hour.  Love the pool area. Even though it was very busy we never had trouble finding seats. I like that there are different pools to choose from.  A bucket of 5 beers is $35.00, not bad!  When we checked in I asked if we could have a late check out and was told I couldnt set that up in advance and I would have to call the morning of check out, the earlier the better.  So morning of check out I call the front desk at 5am and was told late check out was not available, but I could book another night or still have to check out at 11am.  Not sure why late check out was not offered when I booked online.  After I had already booked my room, I had went to the MGM Grand website probably a week later and noticed they were offering a late check out option for $20.00, also for the same dates I was staying, and also with one of their summer promotions.  I wish I had this option when I booked online.  You would think after staying here for 5 nights they would have been nice enough to let me have a late check out.
From bachelor parties to weekend getaways, it's always a pleasure staying at the MGM Grand.. . Close to the center of the strip, lots of great restaurants for anything from quick to fine dining, TWO Starbucks' locations, fairly generous craps and blackjack tables haha.. . The lady who helped me check in for our stay this past weekend was exceptionally cheerful and helpful. She asked what in particular brought me to Vegas for that weekend. I let her know that it was a reunion of sorts and that we were all staying in 3 or so different suites at the MGM. Long story short she was nice enough to upgrade our suite and even send up a comp'd bottle of champagne for free!! The hotel employee who brought up the champagne even addressed me by name and specifically asked "I hope this weekend has been to your special expectations" with a smile. WoW. Talk about great customer service.. . The pools and day club, the restaurants, suite amenities, and most importantly the supreme customer service. What a great value at a reasonable price. . . It's always nice to go to Vegas with friends and/or someone special (wherever you stay, on the strip or downtown), get more than you pay for in the area of suite upgrade accommodations and free bottles, have the time of your life, get treated like a king, and then come up huge at the tables to equate it to a free trip! . . -civilities.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the MGM! My favorite party hotel to stay at. The rooms in the Grand tower are gorgeous and this hotel is always lively. And to be quite honest, I have never seen so many beautiful, gorgeous youth all together, staying under the same roof. Perfect for the young singles, bachelor/bachelorette partiers, young couples, etc.  Unlike other Vegas casinos where I tend to see a lot of older folk playing the slots and tables, it looks more like your college frat house here. Great atmosphere at reasonable prices.... . Also, the Grand Pool complex is fun and hip and a great way to chill and get some sun for the day. Additionally, Hakkasan, their on-site night club is jumping! Great music and a great crowd. I had a blast here with my husband and our friends. . . The food options are good too! Plenty to choose from. Parking is good, although we tend to park and never see our car again until it's time to start the drive home. . . Overall, great hotel--my absolute FAVORITE!
The MGM Grand Hotel was fantastic. My wife and I had an amazing stay. We enjoyed our nice view from room 15 310 and our room was very nice. We did have one issue with our sink and shower and maintenance fixed it right away, but did leave a foot print that we had to wipe up. Please, try and be a little more careful next time. So, they care about making your stay nice and had great customer service. The gambling was great and the odds seemed very fair. Cirque Du Soleil show was a 5 star show and really kept you entertained and on the edge of your seat. Yes, KA the show was a wow show you must see it. We enjoyed eating at Wolfgang Pucks and the sports bar Tap had the best burger I have ever eaten. Loved this place and I want to come back next year on my 50th birthday to celebrate. The staff were all friendly and over all everything is a 5 star.. Thank you again for a wonderful stay,. . Matthew Easterbrook. . Author: Financial Revolution and My Life Around The Big House
Well,  the last stay did not go well,  it is always something everytime we go.  Annoying little inconveniences or a desk clerk that acts like we interrupted his well deserved  time alone.  People opening our rooms with suit cases in hand because the room was double booked...... Awkward!  We were those people  walking in on someone 2 vacations  ago at MGM. We made a reservation for a room online waaay  ahead of time for a queen smoking room but they said they didn't have any until the next day so we had to live out of suitcases that night so we could move to the correct room in the morning.   We have collectively decided that MGM's is no longer our Hotel. Too many issues, 8 strikes... You're out.
Although I'm a "local" every now and then we like a little staycation and try a different hotel each time. This is one we won't return to or recommend. We stayed in the west wing, the hallways are grey and bland looks scary and cheap! Put some colors or artwork on the walls...two different carpets at one point....ugly! Room was super small, I felt like we were at a small town motel not the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. We had plans so we freshened up and left for the evening, we arrived back (late) fell asleep and the next morning while getting ready my fiance sitting in a chair notices there was a dirty pair of boxers under the bed! I spoke to housekeeping since she was in the hallway, I went to speak to the front desk and of course they brought a manager. Who questioned how we didn't notice them when we arrived...as I explained to her aside from being in a hurry, we didn't expect to have to thoroughly inspect the room after all MGM is (what I thought) supposed to be a nice hotel. I Was dissapointed with the customer service from the Mgr (the registration clerk Crystal and Brennan were super friendly =) ...whatever...so we had plans again & left for the evening.. The morning of checkout (which is at 11 am) so i was a little pissed when at 9 am we hear a quick knock and our door flies open followed by "housekeeping" we were still in bed so I respond "we're not ready!" Ugh that was the worst hotel experience I've ever had!!
I will never waste my money at an mlife property ever again!!!  I have a group of 30 coming from across the USA for a bachelor party.  I tried to reserve a $3000 suite plus 8 more rooms 6 months in advance and they let me know the do not guarantee any rooms 24/7 365 days a year.  The day you arrive they guarantee at least two adjoined rooms at a minimum but they will take your deposit for the suite??  Wow!!
Everything has been said about this place so I'll just say that the room was fantastic, the food was okay but Hakkasan was terrible (:
Great experience. The rooms are a great size and the finished are nice. I really liked the mirrors and the shades that are controlled by the panel on the wall. I also like that they have an extensive mini bar available. The bathrooms and beds are a great size and comfortable to be in. I also liked that there are so many places to grab food-plus there is 24 hour room service! I totally took advantage of this. It was AMAZING. There is a new club in MGM which is fun and a bunch of bars to visit. You are right on the strip and if you want to you can hang out the pool which has a fun party during the day. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again and again. Love MGM. Very impressed.
Obviously, I knew coming in to it that this is an older hotel and I did not have high expectations. I want to start off by saying that they really need to create a better valet service - it took us over thirty minutes to get our car after we checked out. The bathrooms in this place are old, dingy, and plain terrible. The shower and tub we had was broken; the water would get stuck going down the drain and the shower head was shooting water everywhere. . . We were stuck with a room on the 7th floor. It was the first time that I woke up in the middle of the night due to the street noise... in Vegas. All in all, you get what you pay for. This hotel is okay if you are just looking for a cheaper place to stay at while in Vegas. If you are going to the strip to experience the full-on Vegas experience, then I recommend going to another hotel.
Perhaps one of my favorite hotels to stay in Vegas. It is definitely on the higher end, so definitely book in advance or search for deals. Staff are extremely friendly, checking in and checking out option were smooth and fast. . . Rooms are beautiful, extremely clean. I love the little jacuzzi in the bigger suites for soaking your feet after a night of crazy dancing. I would definitely come back, if I 1) Richer 2) Special Promotion (wink wink)
First let's start out with a review of the hotel stay.  Although rooms are renovated, it still looked dated, with low ceilings, little lighting and small bathrooms.  What made it worse was that they gave us a room on the 7th floor facing the roof with green light glaring at us all night long.  The motor for the roll up shades were broken.  There was noise coming from outside traffic, people walking in the hallways.  Then we were the lucky recipients of a handicap suite, we are not handicap obviously, so it sucked that there is no tub to soak in.  We called for the switching of the room but was told that there wasn't any room available...or basically we were told to suck it up.  . . Not I'm leaving the best parts for the casino.  They basically tried to suck every last drop of money from you at the tables by jacking up the minimum to unbelievable heights.  I'm talking $50-$100 minimums, even when the tables is not full.  The dealings look miserable and pissed, the players are all piss because no one is winning money.  If I had a choice I would definitely not be back.
MEH.. . I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.. . I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.. . That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed. . . So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
