I recommend the chopped chicken salad.  Very good.  I really enjoyed the different flavors and that it was light on the dressing.  We were very pleased with our waiter, Andrew.  He made the evening out very pleasant.  I am very picky about my wine and he was so accommodating in trying to help me get the type of wine I liked.  I give 5 stars to Andrew.. The take away is that it is difficult to enjoy your meal and your companion when you can hear the neighbor's conversation more than your companion's.  The people were very nice, but the tables are very close and make it difficult to have any conversation with anyone else at your table.. The food is excellent.  I would recommend it and I will go back.
St. Francis is trendy, hip, and popular. It's on Camelback Rd. in Central Phoenix, a road filled with other unique and trendy restaurants. There is usually a pretty long wait on weekends. They do take reservations (for larger parties I think). St. Francis usually uses local, in season produce, so the menu sometimes changes. . . They have different seating options:. - Inside and outside (depending on weather) bar. - Upstairs dining. - Outside patio with neat lighting. - Downstairs dining room with open brick walls. - I like the table right by the entrance that has glass walls. Although it's too warm in the summer.. . Menu recommendation:. The flatbreads are basically a personal pizza. And they're amazing. I really like the prosciutto (and fig?) flatbread. Nice blend of sweet and salty. The crust is pretty crisp; love it.
Wow what a great place. We had the most amazing experience. Great food, great drinks and the service was unbelievable!  We will be going back!!
Best Salmon I have ever had. Great seasonal menu. Healthy. Fast service. Very pleased. Andrew was a great server! Never had a moment to wait for anything!
Fresh produce and baked breads! I enjoy the happy hour menu here. Drinks are refreshing. The vegetable forbidden rice bowl was delicious!
One of my favorite places in Phoenix! Great place to meet up with a friend for cocktails or have lunch with your mom or go for a dinner date.. The food is seasonal and the menu changes accordingly.. They always have a few staples, thank goodness the forbidden rice bowl never goes away, it's amazing!! They have great cocktails too..
Great beer and great flat breed pizzas. Try the vegetarian pizza and the goat cheese dip you won't be disappointed also go at happy hour
Wow what a decadent place. If you want to go to where all of Arizona's biggest and brightest converge, then this is where you want to be. I felt very underdressed even for a simple brunch out. The food wasn't exorbitantly expensive and was extremely good. The wait was ridiculous but I guess it's to be expected with this places popularity. Oh yeah and free valet! Can't beat that with a stick! I do believe I'll be back soon.
Trendy restaurant! The food is up to par and so is the service! It's a little pricey but perfect for a Friday night dinner out!
Went here for lunch.  Had the Summer Risotto. It was good and definitely had a refreshing flavor.
Just found this place and LOVE! The Santa Rosa cocktail was perfection! We also had the Moroccan meatballs and the verde pork...again divine. You can tell that there is love in the food. Our server was fantastic as well...shared his knowledge but not pushy. New favorite.
The food was good. Had the pot roast which was not special . The food took 1 hour to arrive at our table... Drinks were watered down.
A staple in Phoenix. Usually very good. This time was a little different. It was very busy which I always like.  Our reservation was for 830 and we arrived a little early for a a drink. They were very skimpy on their pours. Very weak drinks. We were sat exactly at 830 and our server was very courteous. Service was SLOW. We waited about 30 minutes before we received our appetizer. It was the hummus appetizer and was very tasty. Served with flat bread. For entree I had the roasted chicken. I thought the flavor was great but skin could have been crispier.  My partner had the pot roast and his comment was it was nothing special.  This is the issue with established restaurants, they sometimes become complacent. I'll be back because I have a gift axed I need to use up.
Service-average. Long wait time from order to serve. . Food- fair (we tried salmon entree & a flatbread) . . Drinks- worst part...NOT GOOD AT ALL. After waiting over 30 min for my drink, the "special" tasted like hand soap (mint & lemon)...I don't return food/drinks almost ever but just could not even choke down the drink...the replacement I got (basic margarita) was watered down tasted like it had been sitting in a pitcher for awhile.. . Overall prices aren't ridiculous but for the product, you're better off elsewhere.. . Definitely will not go back & would not recommend.
The salmon flatbread is super yummy! Try the baked goods, specially the bacon sconce with creme fraise. Definitely a great brunch spot! I don't like the sort of forced valet situation,  I prefer to park my own car. But otherwise a great experience.
Excellent service, drinks, and atmosphere. Would recommend the santa rosa cocktail and french onion burger. The pork chile verde was good.  Not a huge fan of the goat cheese appetizer. Overall, not a bad place. I would go here again.
Had  the chili cheeseburger.  The food was very good and we were there on a Sunday brunch day.  Music was unbearably loud.  Service was brutal,   However, let me repeat ,The food was really good.. . If you don't like improvisational jazz or yelling at your guest so they can hear you, don't go here on Sunday during the brunch hours.  Seem like a great wine bar and a very cool atmosphere.
Had the flat bread meat...was delicious.  So was the meatballs. A little on the pricier side..you may dress up and not feel overdressed.
