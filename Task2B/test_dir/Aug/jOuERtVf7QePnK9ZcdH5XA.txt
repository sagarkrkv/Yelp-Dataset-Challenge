awesome service and great food. stayed here for a week and was satisfied all around every time.
This review is based on the potato stuffed wraps and the calamari...if I had to chose between the two, potatoe wraps all the way!
Love this place!  We visit Las Vegas twice a year and always include a visit to the Grand Lux. Have never had anything but an excellent meal.  I now must eat gluten-free and they accommodate me very well.
I love the huge menu selection. Everything here is really good. so fun to people watch also
We came here for a quick dinner before heading out for the night. Since we were staying at the Venetian, we decided to just keep it simple and eat close by. Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.. . Let me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!. I don't care if it's Vegas or not vegas, if you're a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you're at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.. . Finally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was "So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said "Well then you can't have them!! It has all of those in it" in a tone of voice assuming I'm supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, "Egg noodles. You can't have that either!" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it..... . Food comes out, he doesn't even come back to check on us until after we're almost done and it's only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny's. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano's ambiance.
This is a good go to spot. You can't really go wrong because the menu is huge and everything is pretty good. Salads, pizza, pasta, all pretty good. . I would stay away from the steaks they are very average. . The drinks are good, the service is decent. If you're at the Venetian and u want a quick bite it's a good place to stop in.
The Manager Matt was very attentive and his crew was awesome! The food was delicious all 4 times we have been here and the salsa was super fresh!! Delicious!! A must go in Vegas!!
My drunk after club spot!. . If you did not know, Grand Lux is the same company as Cheesecake Factory, just fancier and more expensive.. . I always order to go in the bakery area.. . Sausage, Pepperoni & Mushrooms Pizza - $14 - Good fresh cooked pizza. The size is pretty small for the price. . . Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms - $18.95 - Go to dish here. Pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente. The chicken is cooked well and the tomato and mushrooms are the perfect addition. The sauce is cheesy garlicy creamy perfection!. . Love this place!
The food was pretty good and I liked how there were a ton of options on their menu. However, the service was alright. Our server only came back once to refill our waters and our food took a while to come out. I mean it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't that great. Besides that, I did enjoy my Spicy Carnitas Sandwich.
This is a great 24 hour cafe. Perfect for soaking up all the alcohol after being up all night partying in Las Vegas. They have fast, efficient service and good food. Only took 15 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food and we had a party of 8. I ordered the DeLux breakfast sandwich with hash browns, hold the tomato. Scrambled eggs with ham & bacon, topped with havarti cheese on brioche bread. It was a bit greasy but delicious. Ordered ranch dressing on the side which was very tasty.
A better version of cheesecake factory. I had some pizza and pasta. It was tasty.
love this place!!!
The Grand Lux Burger Melt is the best sandwich I've ever eaten!  Grilled onions, toasted bread, perfectly cooked beef, melty cheesy goodness, and.... wait for it.... thousand island dressing.  Mmmmmmm......
The food here never disappoints (and we're self-proclaimed food snobs- quality over quantity!). . . Our breakfast go-to is the chicken & waffles- they do a good job with their take on this dish.
Average option for brunch. Can't believe it took $1000 of losing at craps to earn enough comps to eat a brunch here. :(
One of my all time favorite restaraunts in Las Vegas!  This place is especially good for breakfast.  My meal of choice is the homemade corned beef hash and eggs with a Belgium waffle on the side.  Service is always on point as well.  I've tried a lot of different dishes for lunch and dinner too and none of them have disappointed.  Check them out!
Minus one star for the service. Overall, great food. I ordered the Asian chicken salad. It was tasty and full of flavor. The chicken was a bit dry though. The service on the other hand was not the best. When my friend and I were seated, there was another group who came in 5 minutes after us. They were served first which which was wrong. My friend and I were sitting there for 15-20 minutes, nobody served us.
Been there for the third time today, never been disappointed. The Caesar salad is delicious and a good portion, my friend always gets the turkey club sandwich and their fries are absolutely amazing some of the best I've had, and today I got the pasta carbonara and it was so good! Good atmosphere good food, definitely  recommended
I'm so sad they closed their Beverly Hills location!! I truly love this place & now I can only indulge when I'm in Vegas. I came here with my girls at like 3:30 in the morning after leaving Lily. After midnight I believe, They only have a selected menu so I couldn't get my usual which is the chicken royale. But I got the chicken picatta & it was so good & full of flavor.
Forget buffet, this is the place to be in Vegas! Their menu is not only huge, their staff is very friendly and helpful through the whole process, given that the it's quite sifficult to decide from such a big variety. They are owned by Cheesecake Factory and apparently they used to have one in Hollywood but closed it down. It is definitelh a shame that I found out too late. Buffets are so overrated, this place is definitely worth every penny. I guarantee that every item on the menu will leave you with NO regrets!
If you're anything like me you love paying more for The Cheesecake Factory - if at all possible. And it's totally worth it! . . The service was fantastic, the ambiance was great, and the food is delicious! . . I had the Kobe burger which was like crack on a bun(tm).
It reminds me of cheesecake  factory. Good reasonably priced dinner. Great atmosphere for dating.
The food is alllllright. I prefer the Cheesecake Factory. The service is good and the bread and butter they serve in the beginning is delicious!
Came here for the breakfast buffet (served till 11 am and is approx $20 per person). I was disappointed in the selection of food options and variety of food. I mean come on we're in Vegas! It came with all beverages (coffee was just okay but the orange juice was freshly squeezed and delish) and your choice of omelette bar, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, bacon and scrambled eggs. There was nothing impressive about this buffet and there are plenty other places on the strip that are much better.
I have been here many times but always forget to write a review. I am local and love this place. The food is great and so is the staff. I usually go to this particular location (in the Palazzo) vs the one in the Venetian. Only because it is usually less crowded and easier to get too.
I love the Grand Lux at the Venetain but my experience this past weekend has left me completely mortified.  The service I received from a waiter by the name of Nathan was beyond rude.  I requested a turkey burger with no sauce and Nathan did not seem to understand this.  He kept questioning and questioning the fact that I wanted my burger with no sauce. He never confirmed my order and actually skipped over completely my order and started asking the other guest with me what they wanted to order.  This was completely RUDE of Nathan "Nate".  Not sure if Nathan was having a bad day, but Nathan needs to be retrained on how to be a professional waiter.  Having an attitude and an ego as a waiter will get you no where Nathan.  My party and I ended up leaving and not dining at the Grand Lux.  The manager stopped by the table but was useless and unhelpful.
As many other reviewers have stated, this place bears a strong resemblance to Cheesecake Factory and is owned by the same company. I don't think the food here is quite as good though, but it does have the benefit of being open 24/7 so it was exactly what my party was looking for when we rolled in at 2 am in the morning. The late menu is a bit limited (two pages only). I got the Chili-Lime Chicken and Mango Salad which was sort of missing the Chili-Lime flavor part, but they substituted the romaine lettuce for spinach at no extra cost which was nice. I also wish there were more actual bits of chicken in my salad (they were so tiny and hard to find you almost had to squint at the dish to identify them.) I also tried my friend's Crispy Fried Wontons which had great Asian inspired flavors but were SOO salty. Personally I think the Cheesecake Factory is better. Great service though, they brought out a cute little desert for my friend who's birthday it was.
I absolutely love Grand Lux Cafe!  I normally don't have time to eat at the Cafe and end up getting food from the bakery ( the bakery food is just a good)but obviously not as great at the-sit-down version.  Came here for lunch and I got the pasta and the salad combo.  The pasta itself was huge!  it was suppose to be " lunch portion" but in my opinion it was the normal dinner size.  I got the telefono pasta. YUM.  The boyfriend got the steak sandwich and it was perfect!!!  Prices were extremely cost efficient considering were in vegas, this lunch was cheap, good and fer-filling.  I packed most of my pasta to-go and ate it as a midnight snack! 5 stars in my books!
Grand Lux is Cheesecake Factory 2.0.. . They have an extensive menu just like the Cheesecake factory, but I would say that Grand Lux has better options that are tastier and healthier.. . The avocado chipotle burger was massive and delicious. I had to eat with with a knife and fork since it didn't fit in my mouth. The waiter was very nice and allowed me to substitute the side of fries with the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was perfectly creamy, not too overwhelming.. . They have a late night menu from 12am-6pm which means that they are open 24 hours a day! After a long night of drinking, you can stop by the Grand Lux for some late night munchies! . . My friends and I came here twice during our trip to Vegas because the prices are great and the portions are big. Many restaurants on The Strip are overpriced, but the Grand Lux keeps it real!
The waiter was extremely friendly and the food was amazing.  The prices were very reasonable given that this is a vegas restaurant and the portions were large.
