We have loved this restaurant since the beginning, but now...Waiting 10 minutes for water, and another 10 minutes to order drinks and food is unacceptable, especially when there are empty tables and staff hanging around talking. Love the food and enjoy taking out of town guests on flamenco night, but if we can't count on good service, not sure we will go back. Please work on improving speed of service!
Favorite tacos ever!  My wife loves the shrimp tacos,  I like the halibut tacos, but we both agree the seasonal veggie tacos are the best.  Go during 3-6 and they're half price.  Also,  the elote is yummy.  Grilled corn with cotija cheese, paprika... explosion of flavor.  Service does take a little while tho
This place has a fun atmosphere, great drinks and fantastic food. I had the chicken burrito, a simple dish yet absolutely delish. We had hung out by the pool all day, and I had worked up quite an appetite! The burrito had pico de gallo, beans, yummy chicken and cheese. It was the perfect size and I finished the whole thing! (YUM!) I also had their margarita. Both of these items were on their happy hour menu- the margarita was $5 on hh and the burrito was $1 off. . . I will definitely be back!
I'm surprised that they got so many great reviews. The food is awful. it's not even good americanized mexican food. i totally regretted going. I had the Ensalada, Carne Asada (the worst I've ever had) and guacamole that was smothered in cheese. yuck.
The Sonoran desert can be a lonely place. The traveler's only friends are Gila monsters and Cacti. So thank god they built a ridiculously impractical city in the middle of it named Phoenix. And even better, they populated it with heavily air conditioned hotels and restaurants like The Clarendon Hotel and its lobby-connected restaurant: Gallo Blanco.. . On an August sojourn through the Sonoran desert with two of my sons, aged 11 and 4.5, I stopped to stay the night at the Clarendon. Lovely place. And Gallo Blanco fits right in with the renovated new-age-hipster vibe of the Clarendon. We arrived after sundown, so the temp was all the way down to 100F! We took the chance to take an 8pm dip in the pool, and then retired to the room to order room service from Gallo Blanco.. . The room service was infuriatingly confusing. The restaurant offered a phone number specifically for Clarendon guests to call and make room service orders. But upon calling it, I was greeted with a message stating the open hours and that yes this was the room service line, and a beep. I left a message stating my order and asking for a call back to confirm. 20 minutes later, I got suspicious. Was there a hold-up at the restaurant? Had there been a massive Freon leak from all the nearby air conditioners, freezing everyone into a giant block of ice?. . I called the main restaurant line to inquire before contacting FEMA about the impending Freonocalypse, and was surprised to get an answer from somebody fully animated. Apparently they had forgotten to answer the room service phone tonight. They didn't even know it took messages. Lovely. I ordered and they apologized profusely and waived the usual room service fee.. . But in restaurant land, good food trumps all. The cheeseburger my sons shared was of excellent quality. Juicy well cooked meat, with crisp vegetables. The french fries were hot and delicious.. . I ordered a carne asada burrito and was very impressed. A toasted tortilla, and spicy-but-not-ridiculous sauce on the side that made the burrito pop in my mouth like a water balloon filled with smoked chili peppers and happiness.. . The next morning we had breakfast there, and the pancakes were mind blowing. MIND BLOWING. As in our minds were blown clean out of our heads while we ate them. I can't remember them, but there were brains everywhere because _they were mind blowing_. I can't use words to describe them. Have the pancakes. The breakfast burrito with home made chorizo was most excellent, fantastic even, but the pancakes trumped ALL.. . I may never follow the same trail I did to find Gallo Blanco, but were I to hear its siren cockadoodledoo again, I would do whatever I could to make space in my tummy for at least 5 of those pancakes.
I have only ever been here for Taco Tuesday, however, I have been to many:) The carne asada is ridiculously delicious and the street tacos are just the right size to be able to try a little of each. The guac is pretty awesome also...they put citrus in it which gives it a different texture and flavor. Very refreshing. Tuesday are all day happy hour, which means select drinks and food items are $1-2 off normal price. The service has been spotty, but for the most part the servers are really great. I have only really noticed a difference with new servers or large parties. Though it's not something that would ever keep me from going back.
My go to place for music,  food and drinks. Wednesdays they have a flamenco show,  fantastic!  Other times they have a band that plays jazzy sort of music, love it!! The jalapeno drinks are yummy,  the tacos are amazing! ! The bartenders are super nice,  specially the tall blond guy with curly hair ponytail (I'm really bad with names). Check out the pool and the roof top bar. You won't be disappointed! !
Great patio, fun music, we love taco Tuesday!  Hostess super friendly, nice and accommodating to my 8 personparty, but server wasn't as friendly.  I'll give him benefit of the doubt that he was having a bad day, so he could have gotten our order right wo the smile..... I won't order the Huevos ranchero again, kinda bland, but the ceviche was crisp & refreshing.  We just partied on....
