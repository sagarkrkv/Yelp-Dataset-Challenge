best burgers and shakes EVER!!
This place is very very good. The burgers and the shakes are to die for. Try the birthday cake shake, it is fantastic and contains alcohol. I've had The burgers here, which are top notch, the buffalo wings are ok and the Cuban street tacos are actually pretty good. This place is obviously very loud (being next to marquee), so I would not recommend it for quite talking lol...
Food was amazing especially the pork belly buns but the service...not so much! Our waitress with a British like accent & super short shorts sucked! She rarely checked to see if we needed anything and when she did, it took her forever to come back.  Even the bus boy was more helpful then she was.  She was too busy flirting with other customers. And when we asked for a pen she took it out of her sweaty cleavage! . Food great! Waitress sucked!
Passed this place on a few trips to Vegas, on our way to the Wicked Spoon, but never got in there till this trip. Very nice restaurant, great staff, nice room. I took the advice of my fellow yelpers, and had to try it out. When you are at yourtable, they bring you popcorn to munch on. That was a different and fun choice. They have a menu of alcoholic shakes. We had to try the Tiramasu shake, because it had Mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger crumbs, patron XO cafe dark, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso beans. I never even heard of marscapone ice cream!! It was delicious (and filling). We got the Cuban Street Tacos to start. That was great. They came with beans that were out of this world. Then I got the Rising Sun burger-Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado. Delicious! Hubby got the Gold Standard burger-Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli. Also very good. He got fries, I got the onion rings. BEST onion rings we have ever had. OMG. Overall great place. Would visit again. HOWEVER, I see everyone here comparing Holsteins to Gordon Ramsey Burgr and there is NO comparision. GORDON IS THE KING. His burgers, shakes, and fries are unmatched. And we have had alot of burgers and shakes on this trip. Time stops when you are eating a Gordon burger. (please see my review). We went there twice on this trip. Its our first stop off the plane.
Love this place.  Great beer selection and food is amazing.  The biggest problem I have with the food is deciding what to order.  Burgers are tasty and falvorful!  If you are a fan of milkshakes, the adult milkshakes are delicisou.
this review was stuck in my drafts from 2012, so, hopefully, things have improved since then .. but I had to share this, as it was a really bad experience.. . I had high hopes for this place, I love a good burger joint with creative shakes and side dishes. Boy was I wrong. . . We weren't in the mood for a burger, so ordered some of their side dishes:. Lobster & truffle mac. Lobster roll. Chicago dogs. Shrimp cocktail Bloody Mary. "Black Cow" float. Decent amount of food right? Get this:. . -5oz of macaroni. -2 lobster rolls with no more than 3-4 oz of anything that wasn't "roll", TOTAL. -3 hot dogs that were the size of my middle finger. . -3 shrimps with a shot glass of Bloody Mary. .... And my "black cow" never came. . . How much was all this?. . NINETY DOLLARS. After they comped my float that never came. . . I'd have been fine paying 50-60 (it is vegas, after all) for this meal, but 90? Bro .... . Add to this, we saw our waitress 5 times. The table next to us got very prompt an attentive service from another waitress, so finally we had to start asking her for help.
The patty didn't even taste good. Ended up getting food poisoning. Will definitely not be going back.
Best burger I've ever had. . Stayed at the Cosmo so this place was super convenient for us. Just on the second floor. . . Had the rising sun, man the meat was great. Never had a Kobe beef burger. It was amazing. Get there shakes. Im not much of an alcohol person so I got the shake with out. Got the crembrulee shake. Man it was great. . . If you want a kick ass burger. This is the spot.
Best damn burger joint ever! Say hi to Kristina Winer. You can't order anything bad from this place. Be adventurous. Try anything.
We initially wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for the buffet, but they were about to close to prepare for dinner. We saw Holsteins along the way and decided to check it out. We both got the meatball burger, which was okay. My son enjoyed the mini sliders and fries. The food was decent, but maybe a bit overpriced, mostly likely due to it's location in the Cosmo. Our waitress was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs.
This place is terrible. The only redeeming thing on the menu are the shakes. We ordered the drunken monkey which was nice but too watery for my taste. I prefer a thick shake.. .  The burgers were overdone and the meat did not taste like quality meat. We asked for medium but they were beyond medium- dry and tough. The fries were also overdone. I ordered the Funghi burger. Wouldn't recommended it. Their "best seller" the Gold Standard wasn't great either. Neither of us ate even half of our burgers and neither did most of the people at the table next to ours. . . They bring you a spicy zesty mini bucket of popcorn which tasted better than any of the other things we ordered. . . The service was friendly and helpful but the food just isn't good. It boggles my mind that this place has a 4-star average rating. It just doesn't make any sense.. . Maybe it was just an off night for the food but I wouldn't go back.
My family and I had lunch at Holsteins and started off with ahi poke tostadas with jalapeno onion escabeche, tomatillo relish and avocado ailoi. The appetizer was a light and tasty combo - we always enjoy ahi and chips. Hubby and I both had their signature burger the gold standard - dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli with a side of fries and onion rings. We ordered our burgers on the med-well side, but were more well, but still good. Next time we'll order them medium instead, so they are more juicy.  I've never had goat cheese on my burger and it added a yummy creamy flavor.  My daughter and hubby had their milkshakes - one chocolate and the other strawberry - both without alchohol. Their milkshakes come with alchohol, so you can order without.  The milkshakes were thick, creamy and full of yummy flavor. Next time I'll order one of their bam-boozled shakes like the creme brulee or campfire s'mores.
Solid burger. I forgot what I ordered but it was definitely tasty. That night was packed but this place was good.
Very loud atmosphere, across from Marquee. Burgers are hit or miss, depending on personal preference and type of burger ordered. Hubs loved his Billionaire burger, which had a good chunk of foie gras. I found my Steakhouse burger a bit salty. The tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to the burger itself, though. . . Burgers are large, and the bottom bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. Fries were similarly salty. No option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. You can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. For a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint.
I had the pork sliders.. Based on that i cant recommend the place.. If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, try one of the other restaurants.. The service was good however.
We enjoy visiting Holstein's at Cosmo when we are in town. Sure, you can eat at the hoity toity spots if you want. We enjoy sharing a burger and Caesar salad. Yea, don't be afraid to share. The burgers are plentiful. Service is friendly and efficient. The only complaint I would say are the low seated booths and awkwardly uncomfortable chairs.
Was craving for some burgers and came across this place inside of The Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor. My husband and I shared an appetizer (Cuban' street taco) which the bartender recommended and it was delicious, nothing I had ever had b4. Pulled pork with smoked ham in a tiny hard taco shell with beans and pickles on the side. We also shared the gold standard burger. The sirloin patty was amazing but as a whole I think the burger itself could have been more flavorful. Adding ketchup and mustard didn't quite set  it off by giving it more "flavor" but overall I did enjoy the burger. The only downside to this was the fries! I'm a fries kinda girl when having a burger and the fries was such a disappointment. It was soggy so obviously they gave us old fries that have been sitting for awhile. Although the burger lacked a bit of flavor if the fries would have been fresh and hot i would have given this place a 5 star.
A little late (!) review, as I went in January this year! But backtracking on some places I haven't reviewed that I went to while in The Vegas. Another one of my researched spots I insisted on dragging my girlfriend to! The burger (The Urth Burger) was pretty squishy/sloppy, so that wasn't great in my humble opinion. But the milkshake was really great (I think I had a vanilla shake made vegan) and we don't get many in the UK that are suitable for vegans, so I had a sensory overload. Very good! Shame about the food and portion size being average!
Holstein's is such a cute place; I love the little cow! Well, maybe not just "cute" - it is also very well designed, spacious, and modern in addition to having a cute little cow as its mascot. But we don't go to places because they're cute, we go for the food, right? My boyfriend and I both ordered the ahi tuna sliders with the fries on the side, and he loved them. I did not like the sliders. They were creatively prepared and looked delicious, however, something about the tuna was off-putting forme. That is just me, though - he gives them rave reviews. Seeing that I had enjoyed a (huge) burger at a different restaurant in Vegas our first night, and ended up at Holstein's because our first choice had a much longer wait, I figured that ahi tuna sliders would give me enough variety and not make me feel like "ugh, burgers again?". Enough about my slight dislike of the sliders, though. The fries were amazing, and so was the chili mayo that they came with! Mmmmmmm....such a good combination, just the right mix of sweet and spicy (for the mayo). The service we received was warm, friendly, and enthusiastic (on all fronts, from the hostess to our waitress). I can't wait to come back, because the other dishes that I saw looked incredible and I definitely want to try those out (along with a boozy shake!).
The burgers are delicious!  The beer selection is admirable! The service is garbage. My husband and I took a seat in the "lounge" to wait for friends.  We ordered 12 Oz beers because we were planning on staying a while to drink with friends and wanted to taste different types. We were served the 20 Oz beers. Not wanting to waste we drank them. We decided we wanted a snack. They have an extensive appetizer menu but we wanted to try the burgers. Not being too hungry,  we split a burger "el machet". (Rememeber we were planning on filling up on tasty beer and hiting the strip. Doggie bags are not good luck on the game floor) It was tasty but not very spicy. Just tasted like an average good burger.  We were hoping for something with more heat. Our waitress must have decided we were cheap since we split a burger and never came back for refills or to check on us. In fact we couldn't get anyone to refill our beer. I guess it was good the burger wasn't spicy! Finally the waitress unceremoniously dropped our check off without saying anything. We paid, left, and took our money else where. Joke was on her. Alcohol always spikes the bill = bigger tip. The next wait staff enjoyed our money. If we wanted a full meal we would have sat in the dining room. If you want good service and multiple beers go somewhere else. If you want to be judged on your order by the world's most mediocre waitress,  this is your place! I'll withhold her name for class ;)
The burgers here are good, but you're going to have to pay a premium price just for the fact that it's inside the Cosmo. Here's why you will pony up: you get what you pay for. . . The buns were soft on the outside and toasted on the inside. When you ask for a medium or medium-rare burger, they don't overcook it. Lastly, the seasoning is on point without having a heavy hand with the salt. . . I went with the Fun-ghi burger with roasted portobello, gruyere, and truffle oil. Each bite had the perfect amount of flavor without one ingredient overwhelming the next. I tried a bite of my friend's Rising Sun, which had tempura avocado, crispy yam, nori, spicy mayo and a patty with a teriyaki glaze. It was even more amazing. I liked that the burgers had flavor without sacrificing the texture. The beef patty wasn't soft like Umami.. . Service was quick. They do automatically tack on 18% gratuity for parties of 6.
Oh, does this place serve burgers and shakes? 20 minutes after finding a table the server finally asked if I was doing okay, but I hadn't even seen a menu yet. Got the menu at that point, but didn't see any server again for another 20 minutes. After 40 minutes without even a drink I walked out and found a place that actually serves its customers. Pathetic excuse for a restaurant inside of a luxury property.. . The two stars are for the decent drunk people-watching that was amusing at least. I'm mid twenties, but they turned the music up past loud and into the painful range. If you're intrigued by the prospect of being mostly ignored as you wait for a $30 burger, have fun!
The burgers are to die for. Not to mention the adult shakes make you fee like a kid while still giving you that awesome buzz only 21+ people get. Appetizers are alright but definately definately DEFINATELY get a. Burger
Man where do I begin!!! . . First off, I've been comin' to the Cosmopolitan since it opened. Love the place! . . Grabbed a drink at the bar, Marcell (I think that's his name) made me the best Woodford Reserve Old Fashion since I don't know when! . . Then we got seated by Maria in a great booth, with really cool paintings.. . Our server Sam came up and greeted us and told all the cool things we should try. I had the Rising Sun, likely due to me being asian, so it was kind of a default choice. Haha, amazing burger though! My date had a Thai salad, she's asian and on a diet. So it was very fitting. She said it was great! . . Food was promptly delivered by what looked to be conjoined twins. Mardan & Edwin (not sure if that's their names) but they were nice and made sure we had all the things we needed to enjoy our meal. . . Sam checked on us quickly and made sure our food was good. It was! . . When it came time to get a desert a lady named Jade told us about this thing that looked like a burger, but was really ice cream. Good times! . The conjoined twins came and delivered our food again. Such good times around here. . . Bussers on point, one even asked me how I kept so fit while eating burgers and deserts. Had a sweet mustache. . . As we left, some guy in a suit wished us a great night and that we enjoy our stay. . . Of course I'd come back!
Ate at the bar on a weekday - attentive and funny bartenders. I was tempted to get a burger because they smelled soooo good while looking at the menu, but I hadn't no regrets because I fully loved the lobster sliders! Oh, and the shakes looked impressive too.. . . Kudos for the catchy urban art theme. :)
Awesome Burgers and fries and a whole lot more great Staff and the shakes are amazing! They are kicked up with liquor!
The burgers at Holsteins are perfection. Size/portion is just right fort he price, the quality is great and the way the flavors play off each other from the first bite will be sure to tantalize all your senses. The atmosphere is nice, nothing too special about it, but very well done. Service is always top notch. I haven't tried the adult shakes yet... but next time I am in town I will be sure to!
What a fun place! We were looking for a late lunch after spending most of the day at the pool party. Our requirements were fairly simple, filling food and lots of air conditioning. We were drawn in because it was right across from Marquee and had a huge pink cow. What's not to love?!? . . The food was good. I had the grilled marinated chicken breast, smoked bacon, provolone cheese, pesto aioli, arugula, and tomato on a Foccacia Roll. It was delicious, really  hit the spot! We all shared a milkshake and it was so yummy! I will be back to try more of the shake menu!
Not only is the DJ amazing on a Friday night but the burger was amazing! I loved the sweet potatoe fries much more than regular fries. The Cosmopolitan has the best eateries and I really enjoyed my meal. .  . The burger I had is the best burger in Vegas 2 years in a row. . . Aged blue cheese, the cheese was the highlight of my burger and I truly enjoyed my meal. I said I would only go to Vegas once but next time I come here I'll eat my heart out at this restaurant!
So this place was friendly and open. In the sense that it feel like a sophisticated friends house. The servers were helpful and honest. The burgers were tricked up with all kinds if toppings. We have the rising sun. I thought the burger was just good, but not wow.  I was impressed with the toppings I just like bigger patties.  However, the wow moment did happen for me with the banana cream milkshake. That shake just made me want to cuddle up with a blanket it was YUM.  I had to go back the next day just for the shake. The ingredients are spot on and the flavor is not overpowering. Anytime I go to vegas I will stop by for one of these shakes they make you think other shakes are child's play.  We also ordered fries they were fine.  So go for the shakes. If you don't drink alcohol they will nix the alcohol for you.
Excellent burger. Good service. Good beer. Doing it right.
Holsteins used to be my favorite burger place ever.. Until I returned yesterday with my family. . . Burgers were not as juicy as before and when paying $18 for a burger, I at least expected my fries to be crispy. If I was served those fries from McDonalds, I would have asked for a replacement.
