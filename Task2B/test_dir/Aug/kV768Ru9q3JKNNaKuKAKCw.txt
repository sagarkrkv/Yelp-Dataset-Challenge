This was my first show in Vegas and my first show of this kind.  . . Now I understand or see where the people on all of the talent shows go to perform and show their skills.  This might sound cheesy but I am admitting that this was something completely new to me.  The incredible acrobatic skills and feats of strength and flexibility are just a few of the amazing acts shown throughout the show.  . . This semi-aquatic show is extremely impressive and is really worth all of the money.  Of all of the things that you can spend money on in Vegas I would argue that seeing a show like this is probably the best spent.  You won't have any regret in spending your hard earned dollars on some of the most magnificent displays of art and talent.  The amount of hard work and planning that goes into a show like this well exceeds the price of your ticket.  . . This hour and a half or so show will keep you engaged throughout with audience participation and comedic aspects.  The stage itself is tremendously impressive and the engineering that goes into it has to be intricate.  During the show the stage rises and lowers providing different levels of water where underwater acts are performed.  It is truly phenomenal.  . . I don't really need to or want to go into detail of any of the acts but I can promise this show will not leave you disappointed.
Fantastic show! This is our favorite cirque show yet and cannot be missed. Be sure you book your seats far in advance as they go quickly. We sat on the loggia and had a great view of everything. The price for this show is a little more but once you see it you will understand the complexity involved and that it is definitely worth it!
I don't know what some of the illiterate idiots here are complaining. They must work for some other venues or something. you must be cultural and pay attention to every detail from the moment you walk in. Start by observing ceiling. Its a pretty impressive start and sign of things to come. I saw this show at least 15 times, just recently 2 weeks ago. IT NEVER GETS OLD AND IF ANYTHING, IT GETS MORE AMAZING EVERY TIME. ATTENTION IS IN DETAILS. It's expansive compared to others and there are ABSOLUTELY NO DEALS TO BE FOUND AS ITS ALWAYS SOLD OUT WEEK OR SO BEFORE,,,,,, BUT ITS WELL WORTH THE ADMISSION. if you're worried about $180 or so for the each best seat, maybe you should not be in Vegas or,,,,,, go to some other cheap and cheesy dinner and show specials for about $30!!!! WHILE OTHERS HAVE COME AND LONG GONE,,,,, "O" KEEPS GOING FOR 20 YEARS STRONG!!!! BRAVO!!!!!
Paid about $380 for two tickets to this show.  This is the MOST DISAPPOINTING show I have ever seen Waste of time and money.  All you see is people running around aimlessly on stage. Really? Is that entertainment?  No story line. No organization. Chaos on stage as various people are doing their own thing. the acrobats were okay. Maybe because we recently show similar stunts at Sea World. Then there were the pathetic clowns who hit each other with a toy hammer. Really? Did I pay $190 to see clowns doing this? I can go and see this at the local $10 circus. My wife and I got up and left early before the show was even over. That is how bad it was. The state was impressive as Water filed the stage at various times. However, that is technology. Its not entertainment.  I have lose all faith in Cirque De Soleil after witnessing this travesty.
How do you describe something so indescribable? Was it a waking dream? A dance of acrobatics and artistry married together? Whatever it was, it was truly stunning. . . I went to Vegas to see O specifically selecting seats in the center and out of the splash zone. I have seen numerous Cirque shows, but this one captivated me. Even my uncertain friend was amazed after seeing O. He typically hates the artistic stuff, not in for acrobatic splendor and remarked how awesome it truly was at the end. Since it was his first Cirque show I am afraid all others will pale. . . The O theater is gorgeous and very comfortable. The show truly was magnificent, inspiring, and lovely. It was seamless, effortless looking, and fascinating. The performers kept my attention every second and I recommend O to anyone and everyone even if I find I can only describe it in adjectives. Go, see it, become mesmerized!
The word is WOW!  I thought I was dreaming!  It was an incredible show and would definitely recommend it to fellow yelpers, friends and family.  Some of their stunts, I had to hold my breath!  It was AMAZING!
Having been to Ka, Mystere and Love, we decided on this as our next Cirque experience. It did not disappoint.. . The show is a technical masterpiece. The stage morphs from a solid floor to a deep pool and to everything in between seamlessly. The show alternates from the comedic to the visually spectacular. The olympic level divers and gymnasts amaze.. . We bought tickets for the top level to the side of the stage where there is only a single row of seats after reading recommendations from others and agree that this offered the best overall experience of being able to appreciate the intricate water ballet moments and all of the aerial acrobatics. You do smell the chlorine though.
A mid-summer night dream come true.  through the rabbit hole to your wildest fantasy, indescribably amazing ~!!!
O - for OUTSTANDING!!!  We had Loggia seats and literally hung on the rails in delight throughout this entire production!  It was amazing to see the action from above the pool, gaining the view of the show and performers as well as the spectacular technical achievements of the pool and submerged stages.  Best we have seen!  Worth every penny!
I saw both "O" and "Michael Jackson One" this past week.  They were both amazing.  "O" was more acrobatic and "One" was more dancing but still with amazing acrobatic feats.  They are both so different and dont really deserrve a comparison.  They stand alone and they are equal of a 5 star rating.   They both left me saying "WOW" many times for different reasons.  "One" has more of an emotional impact for obvious reasons.  If you have seen neither, I would say see either or both-either way-you will be left amazed at the expertise of the people on stage and the amazing production.  They are spectacles to be hehold.  I would see either one again in a heartbeat.  Money well spent for something you will likely never see anywhere else in the world.
Paid $130 per person for the highest seats. Expensive and you couldn't see everything. I expected the O to be the best show of Cirque du Soleil because it's in the Bellagio and it's very expensive. But after seeing most of the Cirque du Soleil shows, I highly recommend going to see LeReve at the The Wynn. I got front orchestra seats for same price as the super back seats of the O and the show was WAY better!
A.MAZING SHOW!  My husband and I have been a couple of times now, and this show is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show thus far.  The water shows always add extra mystery to what's going to happen next.  The show has humor, romance, and acrobatics that will make your jaw drop.  Can't wait to go a third time!
The BEST Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas. Other aqua shows in Vegas can't compare (I don't think I need to mention names here).  I saw this show in 2009 and I can't wait to see it again.. . The music was great as well.
