Just got back from the Rio - Excellent experience.  Great room - very spacious.  Terrific bed! - very clean.  The shuttle service is sooo convenient.  Very friendly staff.  Fridge works very well.  So very comfortable - good security.  Found two places to eat that were marvelous.  Hash House  A Go Go - zagat rated - and a steak and hamburger restaurant (can't think of the name). Neither expensive.  Only complaint  way too much food.  Share the order.  Really don't like monstrous amounts of food - such a waste - for me anyway.  But it is delicious - especially the hamburgers! - Terrific breakfasts.
pros-  our window was from floor to cielling and wall to wall with a view of the strip. huge rooms . huge bed. fridge in closet . safe. lots of mirriors. shuttle to the strip. only SEAFOOD buffet in Vegas that i know of. the A/C is strong. . cons- resort fee unless you book with easyclicktravel.com then you dont pay resort fee.. carnival buffet could be better. pool needs more shade
I go to Vegas once a year for a Star Trek convention, as I told a dealer once I only gamble with my life never my money so I can't speak for anything casino related. This review is for those that like me are there for something other than gambling.. Let me get my one complaint out of the way, which is there is not enough low cost eating options in the hotel which wouldn't be an issue on the strip but since the Rio is off strip you're kind of trapped unless you want to drive or cab it somewhere else. That being said it's an all-suite hotel so each room has a refrigerator so just do what we do and buy food for breakfast and lunch and spend your money on dinner or better yet the buffet which is great, this would be high praise from me you see because I had a bad incident at a Home Town Buffet once which really put me off that dining concept forever, that is until I ate at the Rio's Buffet.. The convention space is great very roomy and much better than the old hotel where the Star Trek convention used to be held, I'm not refusing to name it I just have no idea what they're going by today as they have changed their name a couple of times since I was last there. While I'm on that subject I can't say enough about how well the Rio treats the Trek fans while the old place acted like we were some sort of inconvenience the Rio has been very welcoming every year and the room rate is better than Motel 6 as is the cliental, I'm reasonably sure the FBI could find most of their most wanted list at the Motel 6 in Las Vegas, not that you need to know that but they're likely reading this review since they read everything and I just thought I'd give a heads up.
I booked this hotel thinking it was truly a four star and it is by far one of the worst rooms I've stayed in while in Vegas. The locks didn't work, the curtain didn't close, the furniture and bedding is outdated. Just disgusting. When I called the front desk to complain about the lock and window I was told I could either have someone come to the room and fix them, mind you I'm calling at night before going to bed, or I can upgrade to another room at an additional $100 per night. I don't need much, but a clean room at a four star hotel is expected. Don't stay here if you want a clean room or good customer service. Feels more like a cheap Motel.
* Rio desperately needs better ventilation - lobby, casino and hallways smell like an ashtray that hasn't been cleaned in a while. * Rio's "Hash House a Go-Go" restaurant served us coffee in a mug wearing a previous guest's lipstick - and sausage not fully cooked. * In convention center (site of pool tournament we were attending) patio, garbage cans and ashtrays were filled to overflowing. * We complained about a bed bracket that was sticking out - it took three requests over three days to get it fixed. * Comically amateurish: Hash House A Go-Go is next to a Starbucks; both are open to each other and to convention center entry hall. The restaurants and hotel play three different music channels simultaneously, so nothing can be heard.. * All suite? My room was large and comfortable, but I don't consider a large bedroom and a bathroom to be a suite.. * I find food prices in hotel to be ridiculous - but there's better & cheaper food across road at Gold Coast.
A tired hotel in need of some serious updating.. . There are many goo features: Dog friendly, the buffet, the pool area, and the vibe on the casino floor. However the rooms and hallways are in serious need of a spruce up.. . I think this hotel has now slipped into the bargain bin category of hotels. It's fine if you can get it cheap sub $50/night and avoid the exorbitant resort fee, otherwise look elsewhere.
While it's starting to look a little dated, it's still a great place.  The rooms are huge, with floor to ceiling windows, and a fridge you can actually use.  The buffet is still one of my favorites for a champagne brunch (I love the Mongolian station).  Good pool(s).  The wine cellar is awesome.  Voodoo Lounge still has amazing views.  Shuttle service to the strip.  Great venue to hold the WSOP.  . . They probably should start pouring some money into sprucing up the place, because it's kinda at the turning point.  If they let it go, it will look like hell in a few more years, but it's at the point where it can still be saved.  I hope they get on it, because I really like the place.
Due to the site not allowing 0 stars I am forced to give it a star.  This hotel is very dated and dirty. Our room was missing the remote, two lamps were broken and the light up mirror in the bathroom did not work.  Called down to the front desk and they sent up a remote and then an engineer.  The engineer looked at me an said, "Here's a light bulb." Then he said, "Aren't you going to put it in?" Are you kidding me..!?! Then I explained to him that it was not a bulb .. It was actually BROKEN. The front desk DIDN'T OFFER to move us & then told us at the rate we paid this is all they could offer us!  After calming down we decided to check out the pool - On the way to the pool, a dog peed on the carpet.. The owner made a loud screeching noise, picked up her dog and ran away - Who does that?! We told a worker & they acted as if they did not care.. Like it happens all day.  Upon leaving about 20 mins ago my daughter was carrying her bag to the car, she felt something swish under her sandal & yup ... Dog poop! I swore it wasn't but once we got in the elevator.. The smell was atrocious .. Dog poop, to the point I told her to throw the shoes away! NEVER staying here again.. I can't believe the lack of care employees have and totally shocked at how dirty this place is!
The Rio was very nice overall. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant. The restaurants we awesome!! The "House Hash a go go" is a must see.. . Martorano's is another must do, see, try for great Italian food. It was very elegant and the food was my favorite it. . I cannot wait to go back!
We've stayed at the Rio a couple times in the last year and after the second visit I've noticed a few details that will affect our decision to return or not. The hotel is starting to appear run down - it's the little things. Many of the buttons in the elevator are broken, the carptet is looking tired and frayed, the broken elevator floor indicator had a clear piece of plexiglass covering the LED display so that all the electronics were visible. I don't think these are huge issues, but they tend to wear on you when you obtain a good rate and then add 50% of that rate as a resort fee so that great rate isn't so great after all. The hotel is really in a convenient location and I'd like to return due to the convenience. Maybe I should check out the pool before making the final decision. To be continued.....
Good. - Many pools (4) & hot spas. - Bigger room. - Seafood buffet (if you eat there). ...hmmm that's it?. . Bad. - Old. - Not very clean. - Resort fee is $22/night. . In short. - Hotel: C. - Casino: C. - Pools: A-. . The safe in our room didn't work.. . I stayed there 2 nights, but it was a comp (still paid about $50 for resort fee+tax), so it was worth it.
I stayed at the Rio once. It was nice and affordable. Its not located on the strip but its only 5 minutes away. The view I had was a distant strip view. . . The room was clean and the staff was nice. They dont have room service. Parking wasnt too bad. Overall, I'd recommend it.
Dissappointing recent stay at Rio.  Room was very nice but the maid knocking on the door at 8:30am is not cool especially in Vegas.  Valet parking is a joke, took over 45 min a few times.  Stores within the casino are very expensive.  It is so far off the strip it is very inconvenient.  The pool is very nice
Worst stay ever !!! . . I come to Vegas very often but this experience is my worst Vegas trip ever !!! . . Don't stay here! If I can give negative star I will give them -5 stars !!.  . First of all we waited 40-45mins for check in on a Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm. Not only that we book two room and want to be next to each other but they put us on a different floor I asked if they can change it for me, they told me has already been done and they don't have any room next to each other. So I say is ok .. . We got super low floor, one is on 5 and one on 6 floor, no view at all!! I'm fine with that too but both room they put us at the very second to the last room and my grandpa ( first time coming to the US so my family want to show him Vegas) who's 85 years old and is super inconvence for him, so later I went down to ask the front desk if they can change one of the room for us.  I explain everything to them,  there is a blond girl manager come out and ask me if I enter my room, I say yes but I just put my luggage down and haven't touch anything in the room. Then she told me that they were completely book for tonight and there is nothing they can do about it so I believed her and went up to the 5 floor room. I went online and check the booking for tonight, I can still book a room on Expedia.com with the same room type I have, which is two queen bed, non smoking room,  I was very mad cause I falt that I had been lied to, so I went down to the front desk again, this time they have a different manager an asian lady come out from the back and told me that they do have room left but is smoking and pet room , I told her that we don't might as long as is close to the elevator and we can have any floor but she told us that she can't put me in there because I didn't book that type of room and she also tell me if I can switch room with my family I mean come on !! I already told them both room is almost very to the last room and both room numbers !! I feel they are not listening to what you say ! And they should be more professional and  should already know about this !! Then I asked if there is anything she can do about it,so finally the lady told me they can try to put me in the smoking room but in different tower and is still in the very back without even checking on the computer. I feel they are just bs things up !! And they just say no to whatever you say without even trying !! . . Lucky I only book for one night cause I was about to change my stay to two but after this experience Never Never Never. I'm not come back to Rio ever again!! . . Overall very unprofessional managers !!   . . Don't stay there !!
Hotel is older, however, the price was right and the rooms were a very good size, I would stay here again, not too far from the Strip, and the buffet was amazing!
It takes 30 minutes or more just to check in to this place. 3 people working the front desk. And this is at 9pm on a Monday. I can't imagine what a busy night looks like. When I got to the room I quickly realized how filthy it was. I've posted several pictures. It was also in disrepair. The toilet paper holder was broken, the tub drain was also broken, and the shower head was in bad need of replacement. The mini bar was missing many item. Hopefully they don't bill me for that, I'll post an update
Last time I came here, I was attending a wedding in the mid-90s, I vaguely remembered the buffet offer was large.  And there was some kind of sky show at certain hours.  It hasn't changed much from outside and inside, checking was painfully long on this day because of Deathcon, now I regret staying at the event hosting hotel.  I'm just glad we didn't have to split up to wait for the badges as well since a friend took care of that the day before. And you would think the hotel would put more ppl at the checkin desk for the surge of the guests, and be well prepared ofsuch surge from many years of hosting the same event which attracts the ppl from over the world.  Apparently, our reservation was not to be even though I had confirmed the day before, but we were offered an upgrade $150 to stay at one of their premium suite on the 20th floor of Ipanema Tower, on top of the base rate which came to $340 per night plus the resort fee.  That seems to be a decent rate to me, because I remember paying almost that much in Stratosphere for one tiny room years ago.  We did not have another reservation somewhere else, so why not?  . . The problem with this suite is that one of my kids has to sleep on the couch, as they only allow one roll away bed per suite.  . . The suite was fine, very clean, contemporary but not showy which I like.  I LOVE the big tub by the window, and its switch operated shade.  Nice touch with  the panelings above the shade in the sitting room, they brighten up the room a bit and gave the otherwise dull looking drapery a classic look.  The furnitures were plain and worn out somewhat, the decoration was minimum which suits me.  My other favorite part of the room is the vanity and the stool that comes with it, albeit the stool could use some cleaning.  The walking closet has a safe which didn't work, because the battery has worn out.  I called the front desk, the repair man came and fixed it.  . . Took me a while to rinse my long hair in the shower, because water leaked at the faucet, so only two third of that already economical flow came to the shower head.  While drying my hair, I was distracted by their shower window which I haven't seen it elsewhere.  Don't think they designed it with mitigating the slow shower flow in mind, rather it was a fashion statement or a way to let lighting in from the bedroom, any way, it's quite unique and I like it.  . . Warning: don't use their shaving kit, because the blade can actually hurt you.  Also, I'm glad I brought my own Q-tip, because their Q-tip can't hold candle to the store bought ones.  . . Keurig coffee single cup brewer and the two TVs worked fine and the AC worked great also.  The bed was firm and comfortable, no complains there.  I did not smell much smoke except the third night and I hardly heard any noise.  Had trouble using wifi, very slow or not working at all.. . We use to stay at the Black Hat hosting hotel for the last few years, this time we decided to stay at Rio.  Little did we know that dinning could be a challenge.  The buffets have long lines before they were open, the American Bar and Grill was bursting out of its capacity, so I opted to dine out, thankfully there is Gold Coast.  Lots of other deathcon attendees went over there as well, judging by their distinctive attire with flashing or non flashing (minus the battery) badges. . . Didn't get to try KJ's dim sum, but we tried their dinner which I have to say, not impressed.  To sum up the experience, big price for small portioned mediocre overly salted food with halt service. . . There are 10 lifts for the tower, the average wait for the lift could be from 1-6 mins,  I heard someone saying there isn't enough lift for this tower.  I bet it's not like this everyday.  Also, one needs to insert the room key in the lift for the 20th floor, it's just one extra thing to do.. . The bill was large, our splurge for the year, or whatever makes the man happy.  We are working poor but we can make the boat float by regulating the flow economically for the rest of the year as well.
The best times I've had in Vegas was spent being at rio. My friends and I have our annual trip and found that rio is the best place to have it. Mainly because of the buffet and atmosphere. The staff here is also friendly and helpful when need be. The rooms were spacious and clean and everything always seemed to be in working order. I only give 4 stars because I just wished they had a microwave in the room. I would bring my own but wouldn't wanna carry a microwave around a Vegas hotel. They even have shuttles to other hotels every 30 mins or so which makes it convenient when you don't want to drive or can't drive. Over all I will be coming here again and again! And if they add a microwave, I'll be surely to update this review.
Not bad. I have stayed here a few times and the last time we stayed we got upgraded to a suite free of charge.  Rooms are pretty modern.  Hotel is away from the strip, but they do provide shuttles to and from the strip.
Clean and very comfortable. We were upgraded to a suite, which was very nice. . The gym was good too. Very clean, tons of towels,  lemon ice water. Too bad it was raining so we couldn't use the pool. . Overall, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommended
This review is just for The Village seafood buffet which I heard so many great things about. My mom and a few co-workers said Rio has the best seafood buffet so how could I go wrong ? So I couldn't wait to eat at this buffet and I was thinking it would be better then Valley View Casino in San diego.. . So I knew it would be a little pricey at about 50 bucks and I was fine with that. I got there and the cashier said I could take a look around just to see if I would like it. So I did and I didn't see any lobster claws but Idid see some lobster tails about the size of your pinky finger. That just blew my mind but I was hungry and I did want seafood so I just stayed there.. . They had a lot of cold crab which I've never been a big fan of but they did have warm crab also. The buffet was a little small for my taste but that's alright. There was Asian food, Mexican and American but for the price it just didn't measure up. I order a lemonade and it was terrible the only things that I liked was the warm crab and some of the desserts. . . I wouldn't really recommend this buffet because it's way to pricey, they have small lobster tails that didn't even taste good and it's kind of small.
After a 3.5-4 hour drive turned into a 5.5 hour drive into town, when a lovely woman handed me a complementary bottle of water while I stood in line to check in at the Rio... I had a good feeling.  When we went to check out our temporary digs and found a spacious, clean, and very comfortable room, my good feeling was well confirmed.  . . The mattress was a little too soft for my liking and I will warn you all- those pillows are stuffed and fluffy!  Also, there was a sign on the mini-bar requesting we not store personal items in it... which would have been sad, except that there was also a refrigerator in the suite!  Very nice!  . . This was my first off-strip experience in Vegas and honestly, I may never stay on the strip again!  Or in the very least, I look forward to kicking back at Rio for a few days again in the future!  No resort fee btw!. . And of course- its Vegas, they have free parking and a shuttle to the strip.
Since I didn't stay here I can only write from the perspective of a visitor for a conference.  Like many hotels in Vegas there's a casino.  Wasn't a huge fan of secondhand smoke but it's inescapable at least it seemed that way for casinos in Vegas.  The pool seemed pretty neat but it was too hot to enjoy it.  I mean, we're in a dessert.  There's a reason why it's off season.  The Defcon hacking conference has been growing in popularity every year.  There's no reservations and entrance fee was a steep 220 USD cash only obviously.  Careful about trying to connect to the wireless during that weekend.  Poor other guests at the hotel.  They may have unwittingly been put on the Wall of Sheep for being hacked on the wireless network.  Even with the price and excrutiating hot weather there were tons of people.  Fortunately we got to skip the insane wait and save 20 bucks by buying tickets from a speaker.  There was even a massive line just to buy Defcon swag.  As far as food options go there were quick sandwiches, pizza and salads for convenience.  The Dim Sum we tried within the hotel wasn't stellar quality but the price was pretty reasonable.  If you're willing to spend more there's a seafood buffet.  There's also another regular buffet and vietnamese restaurant within the hotel.
I like the place very much. Clean, friendly, we love huge room with plenty of space and wall of windows. Its bit older then others and some wear n tear shows. We totally loved though the pricing, service, it has more dining in different price options, like burger place and two Starbucks. Loved Royal India withits wonderful buffet.
Nice room very clean and big the food I had breakfast the food was not very good . Starbucks was over priced the pool was great
3.5 stars. The Rio is massive. If your into endless gambling, aggressive girls in feathers, and waitresses in skimpy clothes you'll probably like it. It's defiantly older, but the rooms are huge, you can fit a lot of people in them. I ate at the Pho place right by the check in, which I would recommend, it's good, healthier, and casual. The gym opens at 7am and it small, but nice. The pool is a huge area, with a fake sandy beach, plenty of room to play around. The Penn and Teller show is funny, but so expensive for what your get, some people really like it though. Young-midrange age group. Fun, colorful place. If your into vegasy artwork there's a good little store upstairs from the casino with some good stuff. Tatted girls, sexy artwork,etc..check it out.
The hotel has aged a lot over the years. I havent been here in several years. Checked in on friday at 4pm had a very long line but went fairly fast with all the windows staffed.. . A hotel employee was handing out bottled water to people in line which was a nice for people who needed or wanted them.. . The room was very large and comfortable. The bed was a little bouncy and not that firm but ok. There's a coffee pot in the room but no complimentary coffee.. . It must be purchased from the in room service refrigerator which automatically charges when items are removed .. . The wall paper in the bathroom was peeling next to the sink at the baseboards and the wood borders needed paint.  The room had no walk in shower and only a old style tub with a SHOWER CURTAIN..Really? Everything was clean and no visible mold. . Around one of windows was masking tape on the border of the window, not sure if it was to seal an air leak or if it was used to mask when painting, it had paint over spray on it. It had been there for a long time.. . The air conditioning worked very well and had a updated digital control.. . The gaming floor is large and the hotel is busy on Friday afternoon. I did notice there are a lot more dollar machines then in the past. Not a fan of dollar machines.. . There were two things that are very annoying on the gaming floor. They have a company on the gaming floor set up to sell time shares. It's  very annoying, they have set up numerous areas staffed with well dressed individuals who bother people and target couples.. . They solicit personal information and you enter a drawing for a new Corvette. They hand out a coupon for a "FREE" two day cruise on the east coast. But it's up to you to get there first , at your cost.. . It's all TIME SHARE so beware.!!. It's all TIME SHARE DID I SAY THAT!!!. I DONT CARE IF THEY GIVE ME FIVE GALLONS OF FREE BEER ON THE CRUISE,  I'M NOT SITTING THROUGH A ONE ON ONE SALES PITCH WITH A YELLOW TOOTHED HYPED SALES PERSON PRESSURING ME TO PURCHASE A FRIGGEN TIME SHARE.........HELP!!!!!!!. . If I wanted a time share I would of purchased one in the 90's and would of been using it and not vacationing at the RIO.....please no time shares it's annoying and a thing of the past ......TACKY! !. . On the second level next to Burger King is a cosmetic business . The employee's stand at the doorway and bother people. They hand out decorative bags that contain skin lotion products,  this is to get you to stop. They then use every tactic to engage you in a conversation to discuss your grooming standards as it relates to skin care products. There trying to get you in the store to solicit products. They will actually  say        " LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING INSIDE ". Really??....if I wanted skin care products I would be at the mall......please!!. . They have one Starbucks set up on a very small scale kind of hidden next to a set of elevators The employees are working as fast as they can!!.  Extremely long lines, my wife waited 35 minutes in line just to order two coffees. This was on Saturday morning at 10 am.......they need more Starbucks like other casinos set up in various locations in the casino. . There are a lot of food options , we ordered from a walk up deli and the line was short, but the wait was just terrible. The order receiver at the cash register was just plain slow and confused. We ordered well done french fries and they were barely cooked, we ordered a cobb salad but it was more like a chef salad.. After ordering it was another long wait to receive the order. They had also forgot to give my wife a drink cup while ordering, she thought it was at the fountain machine which it was not and had to stand in line again to get the cup that WASN'T given to her the first time......ANNOYING and INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES.   . In the past the hotel had entertainment in the sky with decorative lively entertainers flying around on a ceiling mounted track above the gaming floor , I didn't see any of this on Friday nite. The hotel was just not as lively and boaring. . . The cocktail waitresses were very attentive and very personable and just didn't walk by and yell "DRINKS". they would actually stop next to you and engage in conversation. . . FIVE DAY PRIOR RESERVATION ON RIOS WEB PAGE.. TOTAL FOR ONE DAY INCLUDING RESORT FEES WAS $163.00  NCLUDING TAXES....DON'T FORGET ABOUT RESORT FEES WHEN YOU BOOK THEY ADD UP DAILY...... . Overall I would rate my experience at the hotel as a THREE I guess.Would I stay here again, maybe!. The vibe was just missing this time!. . Thats it!.......
Our first experience at The Rio was the check-in line.  We waited for about 45 min just to get to the end and be told that there were not enough rooms ready.  They said to come back in 2 hours for a room.. . When we finally checked in I was thoroughly impressed with the room itself.  It had a wonderful view of the strip (backside of Bellagio and Ceasers) and was spacious with a king bed and sectional couch.  The TV had a line going down the middle of it but we barely used it anyway.  The mini-bar was expensive ($9 for a Keurig coffee cup) but I guess that is standard in Vegas.  There was a separate mini fridge available so we could store water bottles and beer we purchased at a grocery store nearby.. . I thought the amenities, bars, restaurants, and casino floor were very nice.  I think the piece that was most lacking was an engaged hotel staff.  The check in/out process was not terribly friendly and staff we spoke with were not very knowledgeable about hotel policies, events, and hours.  I've had better experiences with hotel staff at airport hotels.. . Overall, I feel the amenities and atmosphere are worth 4 stars but the customer service brings the overall experience down to 3.
The Rio is a nice hotel. They have some of the sexiest cocktail servers (men and women). The only casino that I know of with male cocktail servers for the ladies. . Though they're away from the strip there is plenty to do here. They have a free shuttle to either Harrahs or Balleys on the strip. The shuttle runs about every 30 minutes until 1:00am. . There is Voodoo Nightclub. A rooftop nightclub with an amazing view. One DJ outside and one DJ inside.
This hotel is off the strip but still in a festive area.  I stayed in the Masquerade tower in room 9017. The room (suite)  was very large,  at least 500 square ft. It had a large sectional couch,  fridge, sitting chair and vanity.  The bed was very comfy.  I got this room for $29 ($55) after tax so it was a good deal for the money.  Chippendales is here in this hotel along with Eddie Griffin and the Penn brothers (magic show) from what I remember. There is also a zipline that was heavily promoted and a great skyview and Club.  The pool area is awesome, it has 3 jacuzzis and 3 pools from what I saw.  This is an older hotel but has been maintained pretty well but of course it could use some updates in order to stay  competitive. I would definitely stay here if not concerned about being in the middle of everything on the strip and just looking for a good value for your money.  My flight was overbooked at LAX so I took the 45 min flight to Vegas and saved $150 on a hotel.  (A decent hotel in LA was about $200 a night) I took the bell tran shuttle from the airport for $17 round trip.  Not bad compared to a cab ride.  Oh and food. .. the is a 24 hour sandwich shop in the main casino area and on the second floor there is a burger king..... this is what is open really late.  There are lots of other restaurants open during regular hours.  The staff was great,  I would stay here again if in a jam.
What a blast! The front desk took care of everything we needed from the start. All of the staff were super friendly. Shout out to the spa and Collin for taking care of us! The hotel was clean, the pool was beautiful, and the spa was phenomenal. We are definitely booking our entire next trip here! I loved our room, plenty of space, clean as a thistle, and everything was updated and just gorgeous. We paid a great price for great service, friendly staff, and a super clean atmosphere. Thank you Rio!!
Our experience at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas. . (I sent this letter to their customer service - let's see if I'll get any response) . . On Friday (8/22/2014) around noon I called the hotel to inform them that we are arriving late and requested for a baby crib to be ready in our room.. The representative was very kind and made the comments promising me that everything will be ready on time.. . We arrived at the hotel around 10:30pm and expected to check in and go to sleep.. The check in counter was packed and we had to wait, when finally we were able to check in - we were told that there are no King size beds available and only queen beds rooms are available.. Even though the reservation confirmation said: "ROOM PREFERENCES. We will make every effort to fulfill your preference requests; however they are not guaranteed, as rooms are assigned at check-in. Additional charges may apply for some requests. For accommodation preferences for the physically challenged, please call us at 1-800-CAESARS.". . I had no choice but to except that - BUT I don't understand, if I'm booking a specific room I should get what I paid for.. Then, I asked for the crib (which was obviously not ready in our room) and I was told I need to pay for it.. ***On the phone call that I made earlier no one told me about the rooms not being available nor that I have to pay for the crib!***. . I told the guy at the front desk, that if I am not getting the king size beds I should not pay for the crib. Eventually he said that he will not charge me for it.. . In addition, he suggested that we will switch to a king size room the day after (Saturday), and to expect a voice mail from the registration desk.. No need to mention that no one called us or contact us in any way and we never got the king size beds.. The first night was quiet and calm.. The second night, 3am a cloud of cigarette smoke took over our room.. A group of young people were partying in the next room. Doors were slamming, people were shouting and cursing all over.. And then - my 17 months old baby woke up coughing! The smoke was so dense as if someone was standing next to our beds and smoking in our faces!. To remind you, we asked for a NON-SMOKING room, which I assume will be placed on a non-smoking floor, or am I wrong?. It is unacceptable to me that my baby will wake up coughing in the middle of the night because the room is full of smoke - after I paid for a non-smoking environment. . In addition, my parents were in the next room - experiencing that exact smoke experience. My mother just recovered from cancer, and this is a health hazard for her.. I would recommend to change the air filters because when comparing this hotel to others (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, Wynn, New York New York, and many more) - this is the hotel with the worst cigarette smell in the lobby. .

GG Rio, it's been fun! I stayed here multiple times, but was last here for Defcon 22. Defcon is an information security conference or "hacking" conference, just imagine the shenanigans of concentrating a large number of counter-culture hackers in one spot... yeah so things happened. Sorry Rio, mostly mostly sorry to housekeeping and unrelated hotel visitors. . . Do try and stay in the Ipanema Tower rather than the Masquerade Tower if your left with those choices. Some of the Masquerade Tower rooms look very dated with faulty bathroom fixtures and AC. :(. . Great conference area, secluded away from the rest of the hotel there is even an outside area for a smoking patio connect to the parking lot outside. This area makes it easier for transferring boxes and items to the conference. The large panel partitioning areas are convenient and block sound well. The hotel's security is great for the most part but boo for shutting down pool parties earlier than scheduled. . . I'm not usually a big coffee drinker, but attending conferences will make you one. Thank goodness there are two locations for Starbucks, there's one next to the newly installed Hash House A Go Go and a kiosk type one right by Ipanema Towers. Go to the kiosk, shorter line than the main one and runs at all hours, at least during the convention. . . Hash House, really stellar breakfast fare. Happy that they opened one up here, I remember having to cab it to Imperial Palace for Hash House! I suggest the chicken and waffles if you got an appetite.. . KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is a legit Chinese place, I got an authentic bowl of Won Ton noodle soup here. Bonus the staff speak Cantonese. . . Pho Da Nang, expensive for Pho I would suggest you go to the nearby Chinatown for a better bowl and better deal. You pay the price for convenience of not leaving the hotel a key to conferences, Pho is a good hangover cure in my book but wow is it over priced.. . All-American Bar and Grille, a solid lunch spot I've probably tried every burger on that menu. They even have a decent steak for what it is. . . Shutters Bar- The bar to hang out and chat, not if your parched and need a drink fast. The long bar is staffed by two bartenders and takes a while to get a drink.. . iBar- Right in the middle of things, loungy feel welcome your friends as the make it through the hotel's main entrance.. . Masquerade Bar- More of a dive bar feel even though though it's inside a hotel, weird I know. Overlook people playing slots or making their way in and out of the Masquerade tower.. . Ozone Oxygen Bar- Didn't try this but just made note they added it this year, getting hooked up like someone's grandpa with emphysema isn't appealing.  . . Do sign up for the Total Rewards Card, if you plan on dining at the hotel often you can save a buck or two with every meal. Also try and get a room upgrade whenever possible too, you never know what's open. I ended up with a ridiculous room that had a "living-room" area and whirlpool for cheap, totally unnecessary for just two people but hey Vegas.
