My initial experience was amazing ! The food was fresh and on point (and endless). The last time I went- maybe the waiter was a new guy (caucasian, unsure of the name) - and he basically was like "you can only order 2 pieces at a time." He ruined my and my party's night - b/c we kept waiting for him to come to our table like once in a blue moon. Thank god his co-waitress checked up on us and was more attentive. I'm still hesitant to go back.. . Also be warned of a 1-2 hour wait on Friday-Saturday nights
My favorite sushi spot when I visit Las Vegas. Maybe even my all time favorite in general! Friendly service and good food. Don't be cheap and pay for just one roll, do the all you can eat sushi! It is definitely worth it. My favorite was their Ecstasy Roll. It's topped with "orgasm sauce" and let me tell you... The name really speaks for itself. Another good one is the Crispy Rice! . . I've been here probably 3 or 4 times and was never disappointed. If you're in town or a local, check it out!
If I could leave zero starts I would. Came in with my family for AYCE and a chicken teri bowl. Server was irritated at us right off the bat due to us asking for an extra plate and fork. (I'm white and can't use chop sticks!) I got the chicken teri bowl and almost choked on a bone. Really? It was cut up chicken breast! We were only about the 3rd family in the place and service was very slow. Getting sushi took forever with poor presentation. Quality wasn't the best either. IMO - go to HIKARI if you're looking for AYCE sushi!
Sushi is always fresh! Staff is very friendly ! Most defiantly my favorite Sushi restaurant !!! The wait time is well worth it !!
Fast service! Ordered items to go and it was ready in 10-15 minutes. Hostess was pleasant and helpful with the menu items. She even showed us the best combinations for ordering, saving us $10 on the order. I will have to come back and way here when I'm in this neighborhood again :)
I orderedall you can eat and it's so worth it. Service was great. You will get full quick so order half of the rolls so you can try everything.
Lunch 11:45 am-4pm $21.95 AYCE. Dinner 4pm-3am $26.95 AYCE!!!! . Best deal in town. . This place is the BOMB!!! I will come back here every time I come to Las Vegas because it is literally the best AYCE sushi place in the city, and just off the strip. You usually have to wait a while for a table, but if you're eating at the bar, you can go right in if there's seats open. . . I recommend not ordering too much off the menu right when you sit down. You have to finish everything or they will charge you ala carte prices, so you should order from the sushi chef as you go. You can order half-rolls so that you can try more types of specialty rolls without filling up so fast, and you can even order 1 rather than 2 nigiri at a time. . . Don't get the spicy tuna roll because it's just a plain roll with nothing else in it. The pork belly was just o-kay...it wasn't super special and it's just too greasy. The tempura ice cream is not that great either--the tempura batter isn't crispy, just bready. Next time I'll just get 1 or 2 mochi ice cream, because the green tea ice cream that I had wasn't a strong green tea flavor, more on the bland side. . . The $5 sake I got was such a generous amount, I kind of regretted ordering it since it made me feel full too fast. I should have gotten the smaller size. . . But all-in-all, despite my ordering blunders, I really REALLY enjoyed this place. Go for the unagi, amaebi, hotate, and ikura. Super duper fresh, generous, and artfully done. . . Mostly locals come here, so the party next to us asked how we heard about it. They were regulars. It's a small place, so go early if you have a larger party, or sit at the bar if you're on a hot date. It's worth every minute and every penny!!!
I'm not always picky when it comes to eating sushi as long as their fish doesn't look AND taste like it's been sitting out for a few hours.. . It's a small sushi place, but luckily it wasn't busy when we got there. They don't take reservations, or at least that's what the lady told me. Their menu has a pretty good selection of rolls and hot foods and the service was quick most of the time. My favorite was the salmon roll, I can't remember the exact name (salmon supreme? some shit like that) It was just salmon on the inside with more salmon on top LOL. Also, I loved the garlic tuna nigiri. Fish seemed like it was a good quality.. . For dessert I had the lychee sorbet and the tempura ice cream. The tempura ice cream was okay, but I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet.. . A bummer was that uni was only served during dinner time. Now idk my sushi rules all that well but if you ask me, uni should just be served 24/7 with no limitations. I mean it's called AYCE man. Gotta have that sea urchin ;)
This is my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas. The flavor AND texture of their fish is consistently VERY very good. And the construction of their sushi is spot on. I love being able to pick up my sushi and not have it fall apart before it gets to my mouth.. . Their service is friendly and prompt. There will probably be a wait, but they have an online queueing system that will constantly let you know, on your smart phone, where in line you are. So that's awesome.. . If you choose to dine here, you WILL have an exceptional sushi dining experience.
I absolutely love this place! Service has been nothing but wonderful. I love the variety. I'm from Orange County and I still haven't found a place comparable to this ayce sushi place.
Went here for a little sushi get away here at Vegas away from it all...  This place was a bit packed but was seated within 20-30 min waiting... They do have a small sushi bar area, this place also serve an all you can eat sushi!! Which was not expected... But was delicious, sushi came at original size, no overfilling with rice on the All you can eat menu!! So expect alot!  The soysauce was a bit off.. A lot more salty than most place so be careful for all you wasabi/ss dipper :D.. I ordered many appetizer such as their gryoza,shumai, and different chicken dishes as well as 2 rolls which filled me right up.  Overall experience was great, the food is freshly prepared and come out fast so expect a speedy get in, eat up, and get out!
For all u can eat sushi this is a good place place. Especially the scallop and mussels wete delicious. Also the lychee ice cream is a must try.
The food was ok, but the service was terrible! Our check was $57, but we were charged $68 on our credit card. When we asked why, we were told that the server forgot to add couple items we did order. I think the server should had let us know prior to charging our card. 10 minutes after we signed the credit card slip, we were asked to leave since other guests were waiting for our table.. . There are many sushi places around the Valley, so small places like Goyemon Sushi House should appreciate business and treat guests more kindly.
It used to be good but they really lose quality... Doesn't worth waiting.... . The problem is not the price or waiting.. But it's the food and presentation what sucks... . . Sushi Kaya is always better alternative.
On a late Thursday night, a friend and I were looking for a bite to eat, so after a quick search, we decided to try out Sushi Goyemon. . We saw online that they close at 3:00 am, which is usually the case for many sushi places in Vegas. We arrived at 2:15 am, and the sign on their door says that last call is at 2:30 am, so we still had time to order. We were seated and we ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and green tea ice cream. Two simple items that tasted fine. However, I was in the middle of my meal and at 2:45 am, the woman who seated us approached us and humbly said, "Sorry, I don't mean to rush you, but can you hurry up so I can close the restaurant?" I thought we had had 15 minutes left, but I guess the entire staff wanted to go home, so they decided to rush us so they could close early. I wasn't even finished eating! We saw another table leave very shortly after that, and we were the only two left, with the rest of the staff just standing there watching us, waiting for us to leave. It wasn't even 3:00 am yet, but we left at 5 'til. I guess they actually close at 2:30 am instead. I took the rest of my food to-go, and we left. Don't visit this place if you're looking for common courtesy.
I've heard so many good things about Goyemon and last night I finally had the luxury of trying it!. . When my party got here, they said it would be about a 30-45 minute wait. A bit long, but expected on a Saturday night. It's nice that they have two tables outside for parties waiting rather than standing. . . When you walk inside, the place is very cozy, but not overly crowded. I also noticed the menu was very similar to Sushi-Mon. The service was very fast and we hardly had to wait for our food to come out. That was a definite plus. When you're here, you gotta get the baked mussels, salmon belly, and pork belly. . . My only issue was that my green tea ice cream and vanilla mochi ice cream was pretty melted by the time it got to me. Other than that, Goyemon is a pretty good place to grab AYCE. I'll definitely be coming back here again especially since they offer stamp cards!
Very fresh with wonderful variety of sushi, sides, salad and grill items.  It was our first time here and we should have followed rule #1 for the AYCE.  We ordered all of our favorite sushi and rolls plus grilled pork belly.. . It was a LOT of food.  When you order the sushi, they ask you how many.  Since it was my husband and myself, I said 2.  But the waiter didn't mean individual pieces but orders so it was like getting twice the amount of sushi I thought I ordered.. . Tip:  next time, I want to have the feel of a whole meal from the AYCE so I'll only order sushi and maybe only one soft crab shell roll (because rolls are super filling) so that I'll have room for a poke salad, seaweed salad, grilled pork belly, and must have lychee sherbet!  It's refreshing and addicting.
