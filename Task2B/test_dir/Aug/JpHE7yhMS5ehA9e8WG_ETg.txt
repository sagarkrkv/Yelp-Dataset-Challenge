It has all the bells and whistles that a 5 star Las Vegas hotel should have such as hip pools, shopping, casino, wi-fi, dining and more. It does not deserve 5 stars because of their housekeeping. A high priced dirty room is unacceptable. The last thing I want in my hotel room when I check in is another persons visible DNA in the bathroom and on the bed. Clean it or at least hide it. Disgusting. Even after I reported the hair clogs in the bathroom and tiny little hairs on the bed, they never NEVER cleaned it properly.
I really enjoyed the rooms at Aria. Each month when I would go for work I'd either stay here or V'dara depending on who had better rates. The rooms are super modernized and comfortable. The interior design in the general hotel areas itself is kind of odd not what I would have done but it does have very modern new Vegas feel to it which was what the City Center was going for. They have lots of restaurants to choose from but most are overly expensive for what they're worth.
I've stayed at the Aria multiple times and keep coming back.  The location can't be beat and the rates are reasonable.  The rooms are laid out very well and the double sinks in the bathroom are a HUGE plus.  The elevators are efficient and you don't have to wait very long when you call for one.  I'll definitely be staying here the next time I come back!
I thought I was going to love this hotel,and it has been a disaster of a trip to say the least . For starters they didn't give us the room we asked for ,they put us (a couple)into 2 queen beds, but the water pressure in the room didn't work and neither did the tv. We ordered room service a couple times and couldn't even get a hot meal,or ever what we ordered and it got to the point that a simple waffle was too much for them. On Friday I called down to have the TV fixed and the water pressure fixed and by Sunday afternoon nothing had been done. I then went to the front desk where a "manager " named Sara and I user the term manager loosely proceeded to tell me that after all that we are going to comp the food. (The food that I couldn't eat because it wasn't cooked )Or I can give you a $50 credit . She was extremely condescending and I explained to her you are charging me $270 a night and I have even extended my stay and all you can do is give me a $50 credit and still not fix anything ? She basically told me ,to take and moved me on my way. I was willing to give this hotel a second try until I met Sara and her condescending attitude and I think establishments especially in Las Vegas need to understand that customer service should be the foremost important thing. Sadly this weekend in Las Vegas at the Aria dealing with Sara it wasn't the case. I guess I will be headed back to The Wynn or The Venetian next time I am here . Disappointed Aria ,very Disappointed
was here in June 2014 and the rooms are still excellent. . . this time i get to use their swimming pools. There are three pools and a couple jacuzzi. It was too hot to use the jacuzzi but it looks really nice for winter nights. . . The pools are decent size and they're perfect pools for just lounging. They length of the pool is pretty good also, so if you wake up early enough you can do your morning swimming exercise (if that's your morning routine). . . we also checked out a lounge in aria, Gold Lounge. And as an Aria Guest, we got to go into the lounge for free. Just go to the concierge and they'll take care of you.. . staffs in aria are friendly and welcoming. I have no problem with any of the staffs. . . the rooms are clean. . yes, i highly recommend Aria hotel
Short version: Aria poisoned us both and ruined our whole trip.  We are out a lot of money in missed shows and had almost no fun since we were stuck, sick in our room.. . The full story: My husband and I went to Aria for his birthday weekend. We chose Aria because it was one of the top rated new hotels. The interior of the hotel itself was very modern, which was the one thing that we actually liked. We did have fun at club Haze on our first night (Thursday). The next day, we decided to order room service. The room service menu seemed like they had very upscale items, and since it was my husband's birthday weekend, we decided to splurge... BAD DECISION! He ended up getting steak and eggs and I got the Gruyere cheese and ham omelet. Our bill was around $90 so you would think that it would be very high quality food.  We felt fine most of the day but never ended up getting an appetite at all, which is odd for us because we love to eat. We had two shows that we purchased tickets for that night, and were extremely excited about them, since I had never been to a Vegas show. After walking the strip we returned to our room to get ready for the shows...  That is when I started to feel excruciating stomach pain. I kept trying to pull through because it was my husband's birthday weekend, and we had the two shows to go to that we had already paid for. The pain only got worse and I couldn't even leave the bathroom. I finally pushed myself get out of there and attempt to go to the show, but as we were walking down the hallway I had to run back to the bathroom. That is when my husband started feeling the pain in his stomach. We both took turns back and forth in the bathroom. He could not stop throwing up and I was lying on the bathroom floor with the worst stomach pain I had ever had. I can't begin to describe how upset I was because it was obviously food poisoning from the room service we had earlier that day. We narrowed it down to being the eggs or orange juice since those was the items we had in common. I called the front desk and asked to speak to the Manager. She, of course, apologized and said that they needed to send security up to have us fill out some paper work. I explained to them the whole situation. After completing the paperwork and writing our statements you would think they would have removed our room service bill and given us some other type of comp (missed over $400 in shows), but nope they did not offer to do anything. I called the front desk again and was pretty livid so they finally removed the room service bill. It amazes me that a new hotel with high ratings wouldn't be more accommodating to guests that were poisoned by their food. The rest of our trip we felt ill and didn't eat much because our stomachs still hurt from all of the sickness and throwing up.  Needless to say, our Vegas trip was a bust. We spent most of our time in the room trying to get better with drunks screaming in the hallway until almost 7am.  Our time at Aria was a HORRIBLE experience. We will NEVER go back! Our last day in Vegas we stayed at the Mandarin hotel which was amazing, but again we were still recovering from our food poisoning, so we were stuck in the room.
The Aria Hotel Resort and Casino is an Excellent hotel!! The moment u enter your room the curtains draw open, music begins to play and fresh air freshner hits your nose. Great staff, clean, no riff raff, pricey but worth EVERY penny. Pools are clean and inviting with great towel service. I will be returning in 2 months.
Unbelievable hotel!!! Very plush!  Clean! Curtains open and close with the push of a button.  Everything in the room can be controlled with pad next to bed.
This was my first stay in Las Vegas and I have to say from all the commercials and advertisement about the Aria I was not Wowed. I was expecting more, I guess, but either way this place was fun and our trip and stay at Aria was also a lot of fun. However after visiting some of the other hotels the decor and the casino at Aria are just OK.. . The rooms are nice, considerably quiet consideringVegas. We stayed in groups of 3 so there was plenty of room for all our stuff. The bathroom was spacey; however you had to go through the shower to get to the tub which to me was weird. The light switches and the TV was all very modern.  Getting to your room took FOREVER because there is only one set of elevators and then you had to walk to your room once you were on your floor. I guess we got a room that was more towards the end of the building. The view we got was just of rooftops but I'm sure other rooms had better views. . . The hotel service staff was friendly, the hotel maids were very nice and got us more hangers, towels and extra shampoo. The concierge lady was also friendly and helped us get the reservations we wanted. . . The pool area was nice, there are 3 pools, two of them are just regular pools and one party pool. We did not go to the party pool because it was super crowded. The regular pool was nice however there were no open chairs. One of the days we had a cabana which was nice since you got a waitress for yourself otherwise the pool waitress were so busy it took a while to get your drink.. We went to several of the restaurants at the Aria and the food and service were just OK, nothing spectacular. The Cafe Aria was nice but the service took forever and the place was not crowded at all. The little cafe at the bottom of the elevator had great pastries and coffee. The buffet was ok (not Wowed), the Tapas place was expensive but the food was great (ok service), the Italian place was amazing food wise but when we asked for separate checks the waiter gave us a giant frown and it kept up the rest of the evening. The pizza restaurant was also very good and they had a good beer selection but the service (again) was just ok.. What surprised me was that some of the restaurants closed at 10! For a city that's not supposed to sleep this was very surprising. We went to the sushi place at 10:05pm and the woman looked at us like we were crazy wanting a table that late! . . We paid $30 for a day pass at the spa which included just the pools, the steam rooms, rock beds and the meditation room and it was well worth it. We would have booked a massage or something but they we didn't do it in advance so we had to settle for the day pass. . . The casino was just OK, it was not crowded, it didn't seem inviting or exciting to go gambling here. I guess compared to more traditional hotels.. . All in all I would go back to Aria for the amazing price we got however it was better advertised that what reality showed us.

After a long airline trip, we walked into the fabulous Aria to a long line of guest waiting to check in. It took 1 hour to get to the desk... Then once we got to the desk we had such a rude desk clerk named Erleen. . . She was the top of discussion And we did not get question answered about amenities, services available just nothing. . The good thing is that our room was nice and we are enjoying ourselves. But the service needs to be improved at the front desk.
This place is GROSS!!! My wife & I recently stayed there during a lil date night venture on the strip what we found in our room was disgusting. Brown stains on the sheets & hand towel under the blankets on the bed, busted sink handles, snot on the wall in the bathroom, nasty stuff. I wrote them a little courtesy email informing them of our stay & told them we probably wouldn't be back again, they sent one back saying they would give us an upgrade on our next stay. WTF we're not coming back with all the resorts on the strip why would we ever come back to that mess!
I usually never do reviews but I felt like this trip it one was required. Me and a group of friends come to Vegas once a year for the past 7 years and love it. We usually prefer to stay at other MGM resorts like MGM Grand or Mandalay Bay. We figured this year we would try out Aria since it's the newest of the casinos.. . I'll start off with the casino it's self is a very beautiful casino right smack in the center of the strip, which is a good thing. The bakery downstairs is great and the buffet is excellent. The rooms are very nice..... Comfortable beds, everything was remote controlled (lights,shades,etc). The bathroom was the best part, a gorgeous tub and nice glass stand up shower in their as well. The front desk was friendly but after you check in it's like no one wants to help anymore. Kind of like you paid we got our money and that's it.. . I'm no high roller but I am pretty big gambler and gamble for hours on end. Their table limit standards and rating system is absolute bullshit. I sat down pretty much all morning playing a game called "crazy4poker" gave the floor my card at $60 dollars a hand ($15 min with 4 betting spots) and sometimes more if I was winning. Not only did I play but I tipped the dealers pretty well off, at least a couple hundred in my sitting ( I am a dealer in florida myself). My friends got interested in playing but had no idea how to play so we asked if they could lower table standards because other than myself not a single person was playing. The floor very unfriendly said no and looked at me like I was an asshole for even asking, they didn't even give a reason or discuss the topic ( I've been to hundreds of casinos and usually they will bargain or make an exception if it's slow) basically the customer service was horrible. This went on for every game in Aria and majority of the minimum table limits were $25 (at night $50-100)which is ridiculous.  I couldn't even gamble in the hotel I was staying at for 5 days because it was too expensive. You design the hotel for people who love to travel in Vegas, gamble, have fun and stay in a nice hotel. But instead limit it to how much money do you have in your wallet that's how we will treat you. . I usually get comped for food, show tickets and sometime free play but not aria they want you average $160 a bet for them to even consider it,that is absurd. Me and my friends had fun elsewhere gambling the trip (Monte Carlo,MGM,planethollywood,etc) places like those that are fun and enjoy their customers and want everyone to be happy. I went to those places so often this trip that dealers were remembering us and some floor supervisors as well. We tipped them good, drank and enjoyed ourselves. Rather than Arias casino staff looked at everyone like they were lower class unless you were a high roller. We also got comped buffets at the other places.. . There was 22 of us that came on this trip and we all stayed at Aria. Not one person was pleased with the gaming floor or hospitality. We felt we made the right decision choosing aria but by the time we left we felt the right one would be that we never stay or gamble here again. This was the biggest disappointment hotel ever to me in the history of visiting Vegas.. . So if the people reading this take reviews seriously believe me when I say, take other options and stay elsewhere. I would of liked to have given my opinion and honesty to management about all this but in the end we all know they don't give a shit.. . . P.s the pool was a huge disappointment.... It should belong in a motel 6.
Love how new and modern this place is. This was the best hotel experience I had in a long time. The only thing I was not happy about was how rude this pit boss Yvonne aka Bonnie was. She made me feel very unwelcome within the first night. I stopped gambling at this casino because all the other places I went was very happy to see me at their tables.  . . The Aria Cafe was horrible. Found a hair in my food... then I got a chicken wrap which was so bland I could't force myself to finish it. . . Sleep here, just don't gamble or eat here.
Das Zimmer war mega klasse, soviel Technik soviel modernes, das Hotel war klasse. Aber man braucht echt 20 Minuten um vom Zimmer aus auf den Strip zu gelangen und wir haben 4 Minuten bis zum Aufzug gebraucht. Ansonsten haben wir uns in dem Hotel sehr wohl gefuhlt und konnen es nur empfehlen.
The hotel is very nice. It is located in the centre of the Strip, practically near the Bellagio hotel. There are a lot of parking spaces available just near the hotel.. . If you come by your own car, you will have to transfer all your luggage by your own quite a long distance to the hotel lobby. When we arrived, there was a 15 minutes queue at the check-in. However, the check-in service was efficient, and so was the express check-out, which you can perform either by an sms message, email our using your TV set. You can leave the room keys in the room, and just leave. Very efficient.. . Our room (we booked the cheapest one available) was located in the 22nd floor with a beautiful view over the Strip. The rooms are well preserved, spatious, comfortable and fully automated. The interior design is minimalistic and very pleasant.. . There are a lot of dining options within the complex, for different budgets. Perhaps the most problematic is the breakfast, especially if you just wish to eat something light, and a full buffet breakfast is too heavy for you. In this case the room-service breakfast seems to be the best solution.. . The casino is standard, like in all the other hotels, we have not noted any big difference there.. . All in all, the hotel is very nice, with good service and with excellent location - we highly recommend it.
I stayed here the last time I was in Vegas and this by far is my favorite hotel.. . Casino-I got lost in this casino because it's so large and the decor is amazing. You walk in and it screams luxury and high class. I felt very booshie in this place. Table minimums were kinda high. Lots of slots to choose from. Definitely a good casino to gamble in. I lost a lot of $$$ here. fML. . Hotel/ accommodations-check in was quick, resort fee includes wifi around the property, pool was amazing and not packed and loud like other casinos. Hotel decor is very updated and eye popping, my eyes couldn't help but look at how everything is beautifully decorated.. . Rooms-my fav in Vegas. Room is big, about 400 sq feet. Comfortable bed and pillows, electric curtains and shades, a tablet that is wireless in the room controls everything (tv, lighting, mood lighting, phone, room service, hotel requests, etc) bathroom was the best. Private toilet area to take a dump and explode, double sinks with TV, shower and hot tub joined. I could get a little crazy in the bathroom.. . Staff- so friendly, we passed 3 employees walking to the room and all said hello and if we needed anything extra. M life front desk even called us in the room and asked if everything is up to expectations.  Luxurious!. . The only thing I didn't like is the hallways to get to the room. It felt like I was walking for days. You don't realize how long the hallway is to get to your room until your walking it. I fell bad for the people who have the rooms all the way at the end.
Hotel was nice and high tech. I bought my reservations through hotel.com I'm not sure if there was a miss communication or hotels.com failed, but the room was not what I booked, either way it was nice and enjoyable.
2 night stay early August.. . Check in here is horrible. But it is Vegas i suppose.. . Booked a deluxe city view room. Room was clean, comfortable & very modern. A lot of high tech gadgets which were great. Bathroom was massive. . . 1st night we were exhausted from driving so we just ordered room service. No issues at all with it.  2nd night we tried the buffet because we were given free vouchers. If we had actually paid full price for the buffet i would have been very displeased. It is just not up to the standard of so many other surrounding buffets. Don't waste your money.. . Overall if you love modern & high tech & don't eat at the buffet Aria is a good place to stay.
Well my boyfriend and I had a very uniqueexperience here at Aria. . Unfortunately, we were one of the unlucky ones who checked in on the day when all the MLife computer systems crashed. Imagine hundreds of people in the lobby, luggage everywhere and no one could get into a room? Major chaos and unhappy guests. . . We got into our room 7 hours late and we had a panoramic corner suite which took my breath away.. Seriously amazing! . So yes, it was a stressful day for everyone and we basically had a whole day of vacation wasted but Aria took care of us. . They comped our nights stay in the amazing suite, gave us a decent amount of resort credit AND they are giving us a future complimentary 2 night stay in a suite that is even nicer than the one we stayed in. . . This is why I am giving Aria 5 stars. They really treated us like high rollers and all the stress and frustration became worth it! . . Anyways, the entire hotel is extremely high tech and very modern (just the way I like it:)) the suites are so luxurious and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to stay in a standard room again because of how much they spoiled us! ;) can't wait to come back!!
This would be my 2nd and LAST stay at the Aria Hotel and Resort..My girlfriend decided to go to Vegas for her 50th bday and asked for hotel suggestions.I basically made this hotel walk on water to her and she picked it. But boy was I humiliated when I arrived at the hotel. First off the Bell Hop stand and the valet ppl working outside are non responsive and very unwelcoming, not one person said welcome to the Aria or so much as opened the door. The line for check in was SIMPLY OUTRAGEOUS. BUT believe it or not things were good then. It was at the checkin counter when things got worst. Starting with the clerk. She started off lying to me right off, no matter how or what I asked for, it was an automatic response of,"it's not available".. I received my room assignment and proceeded to my room. Upon entering the room NOTHING!!! now I know the lights should come on, the curtains are suppose to auto open and the television is suppose to come on welcoming me with my name!!! The room was half clean with nasty hairs in the bathroom sink and the carpet had stains all over it.. Of course I called to be moved..I was moved within minutes to a room that I asked for at checkin and was told it was not available.. Never the less this hotel was a huge disappointment since my last stay in May of 2013. The CUSTOMER SERVICE at this place is HORRIBLE.. I plan to never recommend or stay at the ARIA again..I also plan to let my experience be known on every site possible...VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED with my stay
I don't have a single bad thing to say about the Aria. This is a beautiful modern casino/hotel. The decor is tastefully done from the casino to the hotel. . It isn't a casino that caters to kids, and that's fine because it's a perfect place for adults. . The staff is excellent and helpful. I have been here several times, and have never had an incident. As a matter of fact during hotel check in I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and the front desk sent chocolate covered strawberries and a box of macaroons up to my room. Perfect touch. . There is a wide selection of restaurants that should suit any taste. I've been to several of them and so far so good. . As a tip I want to say to sign up for their players card even if you are not gambling because the benefits do add up.
Aria was very nice! We had a corner suite that was lovely. We loved the sliding door that separated the bedroom from the living room. The automated lights and curtains were also great. . . Not five stars in our book mostly for the wait during check-in. While some say, "you should always expect to wait to check-in in Vegas", we would argue that you should NEVER have to wait for a room that has been pre-booked. When will hotels realize that the current traditional check-in methods are a big downer. . . You just walked into the place - and the first thing you do is STAND IN A LINE? Do the math on the common sense of a FIRST IMPRESSION hotel industry! . . The bathroom had one of those fancy Toto? toilets. The master bath was big and had a big shower with a tub nearby. The tub had jets. . . The pool at Aria, (we did not do the Liquid Pool), was nice. Our waitress/server was not good. . . The valet wait was up to 20 to 35 minutes in the early afternoon. . . Aria's location is not bad but it is not great either. It is a healthy walk from Aria to the the action in the heart of The Strip.
This by far is the worst experience I have ever had attending a 5 star hotel that's top 5 in Forbes list. I am truly disappointed. When I arrived at the hotel I entered through the North Valet where I come to find out that u have to carry my luggage through the entire casino, because they do not provide bell desk at that entrance. As I check out the valet brings me my car and inform me that there is a nail in the tire. I mean I know incidents happen. But as I try to file a claim that my vehicle has been damaged they say sorry there is nothing we could do about this. Long story short spent a ton of money at a 5 star hotel that couldn't even give me good customer service. Next review will go on BBB. If you want to get what you pay for stay at a different place.
If you plan to book a room facing the strip and want to sleep in the next day...beware! The blackout curtains are not true blackout curtains. I was really upset that I was woken up by sunlight especially when Vegas is known for there blackout curtains, i even took a pic at 10am this morning to prove it.
This hotel was by far one of the prettiest for its cost. The restaurants  bathrooms and rooms were killer. Clean rooms and yummy food. Best buffet by far.
Very nice.  Everything is controlled by a tablet by the bed...even the window blinds! Very nice pool area, staff is friendly, but took way to long to check in! But we were surprised with a $75 resort credit! I'll definitely going back if that continues!
I stayed at the Aria Hotel for 5 days and 4 nights in June 2014, I enjoyed this hotel very much, this was my first trip to Las Vegas. The hotel is very modern and up to date, the curtains and lights were a bit confusing at first, but I eventually got the hang of it. They have a bathtub/shower combo which was something I had never expereinced in a hotel and think itis a great idea. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend. . . Despite the five star rating, I had issues with the following:. 1. They provided Wi-Fi for 2 days and then you have to pay for it, that should be included for free, for the duration of the stay. Also, the signal would go in and out on my iPhone and iPad that should be improved. . 2. The room service would come later and later it seemed each day, One day our room was not cleaned until 1PM. That is not acceptable.. 3. The fridge was stocked full and if you remove an item, even briefly, you are charged. They should have an empty one, that is not $28 dollars per day.. . Aside from those three things, Aria, was perfect, very clean, nice casino, and the staff was very courteous and I thoroughly enjoyed Las Vegas, thanks to Aria!
A great hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights. Elevator numbering was a bit confusing. Pools were great...lots of chairs to lounge in. Staff were all friendly and accommodating. It's a bit of a walk to the strip and to where the major action happens but it's manageable. Would definitely be coming back again!
Really liked this hotel. The whole building is new and felt clean and modern. Our room was huge and on a high floor (and at a very good price). The casino was fun though not particularly unique. It's also very family friendly, as opposed to the party atmosphere at the Cosmo next door.
Great casino !!! Right in the middle of everything. It's very modern and all their rooms are nice. The beds are very comfortable ! Their sky suites are the best suites in town, very sleek and chic! There's many restaurants to choose from. Top 3 are bar masa , Javier's and Sage. The sports book is nice and easy to put in a bet. It gets really really busy though during weekends. Poker room is always packed also.
Huge disappointment. Our room was dirty and somewhat disgusting, especially for the price.  The carpet was clearly not vacuumed.  We found leftover candy by the ice bucket and dirt and hair pins on the floor. There was a shirt tag on the chair also.  Mirror was dirty. We called to have the room cleaned again and it was marginally better. Having stayed at several hotels in Vegas, this is by far the worst experience.  The valet seemed understaffed and no blackjack tables without continuous shuffle unless you bet $50+.
Geniales Hotel, geniale Zimmer. Viel Technik, leider war die Klimaanlage viel zu kalt und nicht richtig regulierbar. Besonders unangenehm im Bad :( Wir hatten eine corner suite in der 34.Etage! Hammer! Eine sagenhafte Poollandschaft gehort dazu, die seinesgleichen sucht. Allerdings sind die Wege sehr weit, also moglichst nichts vergessen......;)
The Aria is amazing! It is modern, and clean for a reasonable price. . Pros of the room:. 1)everything in the room is controllable by a remote control!!!. 2)super clean and modern. 3)Amazing views no matter which floor or side of the hotel you are on!. Pros of the hotel:. 1)Amazing variety of restaurants . 2)beautiful lobby. 3)Excellent architecture . 4)super cool water falls. 5)convenient location . 6)There are no cons!. . If you are planning to stay at Las Vegas I would highly recommend this hotel.
This hotel is okay. Not worth the amount they charge. I usually like to stay at the Mlife hotels and never had any problems while visiting. So what went wrong here was first of all the check-in took forever and my party was given the wrong information regarding the transaction. We we're suppose to be check-in at 9am, but was delayed by the person checking us in at the hotel because she gave us the wrong information and made us waste time by having us run around trying to find a Wells Fargo. Next the maid open the door during our visit when the light was clearly marked as privacy. The toilet broke and we had to wait for maintenance to come fix it. The light was flickering off and on. Also there was a red stain on one of the sheets. Finally when we checked out the lady checking us out was giving us attitude about printing a receipt. Honestly there are way better hotels then this place. Also for something that is more new to the strip compared to the other hotels it looks old in the rooms and hallways. The only reason I am giving the one star was because the Zarakana show was really good and so was the theatre it was playing in. I was just really frustrated with everything that I even took the time to do there 30min survey and explain everything that went wrong with there staff. I am so mad i even created a yelp account just so I can rate them and share this with people planning or thinking of staying at the aria. I will no longer be staying at the aria.
I love Aria! It's the only hotel we stay in when we go to Vegas. I love how clean and modern it is. The customer service is friendly and welcoming, the only thing I dislike was the long wait to check in, but it's Vegas and that's to expect. The spa is a must! Most relaxing spa ever, I absolutely love it. They have a good price for it too. Javier's restaurant is a bit pricey and I don't really consider it to be authentic Mexican food. The pizza place is awesome as well. House keeping was excellent, there is also a convenient store 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel so it's very convenient for snacks and stuff especially for the pricey items they have in their fridge. I would definitely recommend Aria.
Cosa dire di questo fantastico hotel/casino?. Struttura nuova, in ottima posizione.. Parcheggio gratuito su piu piani, facilmente raggiungibile e ben collegato con reception e casino.. Il check in e stato l'unico punto di minima debolezza in quanto abbiamo dovuto fare un po di fila, ma smaltita velocemente.. La stanza era ad un piano alto con vista stupenda.... Camera spettacolare, super tecnologica e gestibile attraverso piccolo monitor touch.. All'interno dell'hotel oltre al casino ci sono una serie di ristoranti sicuramente di buon livello.. Anche il check out e tecnologico e si puo effettuare via mail.. Stanze pulitissime....insomma...su un posto del genere fatico a trovare qualche minima nota stonata!. Per il prezzo pagato, consiglio assolutamente!!!!
Great hotel! I loved the technology here. Walking into the room and the curtains opening automatically was amazing and just everything about the room was great and luxurious. What made it the best was the service at check in, Crystal helped us and she was so accommodating, super personable and funny! This is a Great place to stay!
Our sixth stay here and there is a reason we keep coming back.. . We have been lucky enough to have stayed at most of the 5-star hotels on the strip but keep returning to Aria. Part of the reason is location but so much more. It still has a very modern, clean feel to it. It is not as ultra elegant as Bellagio, Mandarin Oriental, Wynn or Encore (we stayed at all) but is just great "upscale Vegas." Our favorite Vegas restaurant is here as well (see my reviews for Sage). . . I won't repeat much of what my past review said about Aria but I would suggest registering with MLife, then look for a great deal here. We always think about staying elsewhere but there is a reason we always wind up back at Aria. And by the way-we are ALWAYS glad we came back!
Beautiful room and attentive staff however our ice maker and fridge didn't work in a penthouse sweet. Other than that this stay has been phenomenal! Oh and the pools are to die for!
Very pretty view. They were not kidding when they said every room as a corner view. I would recommend staying here to a friend. Very friendly check in staff also.
From the smooth check in to the adjustment when the room didn't meet out needs, this - is a class act. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had breakfast at the Aria Cafe both days we were there and the first day it was slow and unrushed   but
