I had the opportunity to try out Monta Ramen based on a recomendation from a co-worker.  This place is very small and tucked away in a strip mall on Spring Mt Chinatown.  I thinkthere is table seating for 16 inside, plus another 8 or so at the bar.  I tried to time it so I wouldn't have to wait as I've heard there can be a long line to get in.  Got here at about 6:30 pm and was able to get a seat right away at the bar.  Ordered a Shoyu ramen with extra pork and egg.  Even though my friend recommended the kimchee fried rice I was here to sample the ramen.  . . The ramen came out pretty quick, noodles were nice and crisp and the broth was clean and not too salty as others have said.  The pork was sliced very thing, but it was very flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious.  The egg was also very good, rivaling the egg here in San Diego at Yakiyudori.  . . Overall a very good bowl of ramen in Sin City.  4 Stars!
Extremely good and authentic. I doubt the owners are chinese or korean. The workers are mostly japanese believe it or not and as far as the food itself is GREAT im definitely going back i love it it also feels like youre in japan by the way its set up
This place does it oh so well. The menu is small and simple but oh so delicious. You can customize with a few different toppings but the base product is incredible. An excellent late night option worth checking out again and again that won't break the bank.
Be patient there will be a wait here.  This is a small restaurant with a bar seating area.  Nothing too fancy for just getting a good wholesome bowl of Ramen . . See below my lunch meal after a crazy night in Vegas.  Everything is an additional w/cost.   . . Miso Ramen 7.25 . Pork Broth w/thin noodles (you can choose between chicken or pork broth, thin or wide noodles) . . Special toppings for your Ramen:. Chasu Pork $2.50. Spicy $1.50. Shreeded Green Onion $1.50. Seasoned hard boiled egg $1.50. Takana Mustard Leaf  $1.50. Corn .50. . Other: . Gyoza $5.50. . So this place is off the strip, you would need to take a cab here.  It is located in the Chinatown area of Vegas.  We waited for about 45mins, got seated and went straight into ordering our meal.  The service was fast.  Ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before I mixed everything altogether I tried the broth and it was very good.   Adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, Mustard Leaf and Chasu in Pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  I really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  Otherwise, the Chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  Everything in the bowl was well portioned. Then I had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.  Overall, I would come back here and not make the same mistake by ordering too many salty add ons in my ramen.
This place was good enough that we came 2 nights in a row!. . We were in Vegas for a friend's wedding and was scouting around for something Asian that didn't cost an arm and leg. While I was browsing reviews for another place (Fukumimi), the common thing locals were saying were that Monta was better, so why not! The plus side is they are open past 10PM, which baffles me that buffets on the strip close at 10PM.. . I love the simplicity of the menu options. Was so glad that bean sprouts aren't even included in the ramen (except for their cold dish) because let's be real, bean sprouts are used for fillers most of the time.. . The broth was awesome and probably the best tonkotsu I've had to date. It could get rich after awhile, so come hungry!. . I also ordered mine with their nitamago (hard boiled eggs), and these were the good ones that have been soaking in broth goodness, not just sliced and added on top, so it was melty goodness.. . This place is definitely going on my top ramen places and will be visited again next time I'm in Vegas.
Oh my goodness. I was out here on vacation for a week and came back here twice because it was so good! Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen was my go-to both times.  It was my first time having authentic Ramen and it was delicious.  The pork, abundant in portion just melts in your mouth and the broth - my lord, the broth was creamy and rich and thick and so tasty.  The bowls were the perfect size too! My boyfriend and I joked that this is better than pho, but I put pho in a totally different category ;) . . We came here around lunchtime during the weekday and on both occasions, there was about a 10-15 minute wait, but it's worth it guys! It's definitely easier if you're a single diner or just the two of you.  A party of 3 or more -- be prepared to wait.  The place was rather small so I got worried, but the staff are efficient and people are in and out.  We were seated at the counter closest to the kitchen, so it got pretty hot while waiting and eating our ramen, but it wasn't too bad.  For the amount you get and the absolute tastiness of everything -- it was worth every bit of wait and effort especially for being under $10 for a bowl.  . . I recently came back to DC and decided to try another ramen joint in the city and it didn't even comeclose.  Boyfriend and I were really disappointed because Monta Ramen has set the bar high for us and I cannot wait to come back to Vegas just for another bowl! . . I definitely recommend this place if you're traveling or trying Ramen for the first time.  You will not regret it! The Spicy Tonkotsu wasn't even spicy for those who are hesitant  about the level of spice.  The dumplings were also delicious and fresh.  I miss you, Monta Ramen, and all the over delicious Asian eats in Vegas!
1-5 scale. . Service: 4. Cleaningness: 3.5. Food Quality: 3.5. . I've tried a lot of ramen places and I'm simply comparing to the places we have available in Vancouver (which has a lot of good ramen joints).. . The staff is very friendly and service was fast.  We had to come back a second time because the wait was so long the first time and lucked out with no wait the second time.. . Despite the 3 star rating, the food is good, but based on my past experiences is certainly not worth an hour wait.. . The portions are good and the soup is rich (almost too salty for me) -- had the miso ramen.. . Overall, would recommend if there is a 15min or less wait.
I was hoping Monta would be a good replacement for my normal hangover pho craving but it was not. I think it was little overrated.. . Parking lot is pretty big. Service was good. The restaurant itself is super duper small. Like 5 tables and a bar area. . . Spicy Tonkotsu - $7.95 - Basicly the same thing as the tonkotsu but with a spoon full of a chili paste. I do not think that spoon full is worth the extra dollar they charge. The broth was clean and the spice was decent. Not to salty. I like the noodles. Had good bite. The chashu was over cooked, fell apart in the broth. I had to dig around for it.. . Miso - $6.95 - Clean broth with good miso flavor. It was super salty. I did not like the noodles in this ramen. The texture reminded me of the dry bagged ramen. .  . Corn - $.50 - Plain sweet corn. I like corn in my ramen. Good price.. . Seasoned Egg - $1.50 - Basicly an egg seasoned with soy sauce. The yolk was good. Not worth the price though. . . BIG ISSUE. There was a hair in one of our ramens.GROSSS!!! Usually when there is a hair in your food, they replace it and do not charge you for it but they still charged us. That was a little annoying.. . Overall, decent ramen mixed with bad gross luck. Still perfer pho.
I am a total foodie and this place is hands down probably the place I would choose for my last meal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! best ramen EVER and I am Japanese so I know Ramen , my family used to own a ramen place in Hawaii so I grew up on good ramen , Monta is that meal that you know is going to be prefect everytime . I always get the Kuro , black garlic tonkatsu ramen , the pork belly bowl is my fav too and the gyoza , out of this world , OMG i would eat there everyday if I could but its kinda salty so I look all puffy the next day but it is SO worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loooove the kuro ramen (black garlic oil)!! Went here for the first time this past summer. I know it's good because I went twice and both days it was 100+ degrees!if ur eating ramen in that kind ofweather it must be good. I will definitely be back next time I'm in vegas.
I love this place!! Have been going here for the past few years and love their staff and menu.  Yes it's very small and cramped but the food is so good that like many of the regulars who come here a few times a week I will be waiting even in 110 degree weather because the food is that good!! It's also really comforting to go someplace where the staff knows you and appreciates that you come back time and time again when there are so many other places to eat in LV. The food is made to order and I have never been disappointed!!
Service is fast and Very good food. Worth the wait!
The decor is minimal, there's no trendy music, it's all about good ramen.. . Get there early and be prepared to wait. I counted six tables and there's a bar that seats 9. When you walk in the door there is a tiny waiting area with a couple chairs. There is not a hostess, you sign yourself in and wait for a seat to open up. . . The food is delicious and it's really fun to sit at the bar and watch the chefs sling out bowls of hot ramen. I had the shoyu ramen which is a thick wavy noodle with a chicken and vegetable broth. Very tasty. Warning! Wear something cotton and east to clean. With all that noodle slurping you're sure to get some broth on you.
The decor is minimal, no music, and tiny shop, but the food was excellent.  I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and was not disappointed.  . . The place was crowded, but we were seated extremely quickly on this visit.  The food took a while, but definitely worth the wait.  This is my go-to place for ramen in vegas now.
This review is based on the Kuro tonkatsu ramen, kimchee fried rice, and gyoza. I personally thought the tonkatsu broth was way too rich and thick for my likings. It almost felt like I was slurping a thin gravy. The charsiu / pork slices was extremely fatty, melted like butter in your mouth. For some, this may be a great thing, but for me it was just a little too much paired with the overly rich broth. It wasn't bad ramen, but nothing about this bowl of ramen stood out. The kimchee fried rice and gyoza was a little lackluster too.
My ramen obsession that seems to never end.. .  I stumbled upon the best ramen place in Las Vegas called Monta Ramen. No, not really, I really yelped it. It was as if the ramen gods heard my cravings and made it rain (it's summer) to set the mood. It also cut the line short as people started leaving due to the heavy rain and well... long wait. We, obviously took advantage. T'was meant to be. I ordered miso ramen and added extra chashu pork, flavored egg & shredded green onions for that extra crisp. Mister ordered tonkotsu shoyu ramen with flavored egg. Thank goodness he did because I was very much torn and even thought about getting both for myself. Mine was hands down better than his. I'm sure he thought the same because he had my bowl for a good 10 minutes and made a serious dent. On top of all that goodness, we ordered a pork belly bowl & we each had 2 glasses of Asahi beer. Best meal ever!. . The only thing is, this place is quite small.
Monta Ramen is a very small restaurant.  It was busy and our wait was about 30 mins.  Hubby had the tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen with green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage and added nori. I shared with our daughter the tonkotsu-shoyu (pork bone & special shoyu base) ramen with green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage and added nori and a hard boiled egg.  We also had fried rice with pork, kimchi and extra chashu pork.  Our food was served fast, and the ramen and broth were tasty and the fried rice was delicious.
Stopped by with my family of five for a casual dinner during our trip to Las Vegas. The place was packed, almost all of the about 35 seats were taken, but the wait time wasn't longer than 10 minutes. After being seated, we ordered the fried rice, miso ramen, and tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Nothing on the menu was over $8, but you have the option to add additional toppings for a small price. . . The fried rice was exceptionally delicious and my highest recommendation. It makes a decent plate for one person without becoming too full. The balance between the ingredients, or at least the rice, meat, and onions was perfect, which brought a full taste in every bite. Easily one of the best fried rices I've ever had with a seemingly simple composition. . . The miso and tonkotsu-shoyu ramen were individually good, however, considerably average compared to other ramen. The ramen comes with pork, sliced green onion, and mushrooms (shiitake if I'm not mistaken). The miso noodles in comparison to the tonkotsu-shoyu noodles are a bit thicker, not too much but definitely noticeable. The main difference is in the broth. I personally couldn't distinguish an exact taste difference, but the tonkotsu-shoyu broth was a lot saltier, almost too salty for me. Aside from that, the ramen were both really good; the noodles were cooked perfectly, pork was delicious, along with the mushrooms and touch of green onion.. . TLDR: the fried rice was exceptional, ramen was alright, I preferred miso over tonkotsu-shoyu ramen, everything was a good price for filling portions, the place is pretty small so don't bring your whole fambam :p
By far the best Ramen place I've had! I ordered the tonkotsu shoyu ramen and the broth was very flavorful (a little salty for me, but a bit of hot water made it perfect), chashu was very tender, and the portion was good as well. Definitely coming back :)
This was my very first experience with ramen in a restaurant. I guess I was expecting a lot more. The flavor was okay, although very salty. You have to pay extra for every single thing, and there were several things I would expect that were not offered. Frankly, the flavor was not much better than a cup of noodles from the grocery store.. . Except there were mushrooms. Lots and lots of mushrooms. Which would have been nice if they warned me on the menu, since I am allergic. . . I don't know why this place is aso popular with the hipsters. It is cramped. It is tiny. It isn't that clean. It plays classic rock and has no particular decorating scheme. Seating is seriously uncomfortable. Parking sucks.. . They sat me at the very first itty bitty wooden bar stool right by the kitchen and beverage machine (blowing hot air, adding insult to injury). Every time someone walked by, they hit me in the ass. I couldn't see more action as a pole dancer. Half way through my meal, I gave up. . . The place was absolutely stoking hot. If the A.C. is out, warn people. I would have gone to the store, grabbed some Top Ramen, and gone home to add my own cilantro, lime, corn, and spicy seasonings, been cool, and not been groped.. . I simply do not get the lines here. If this is what it's all about, perhaps ramen is not for me.
Great bargain! For fantastic Ramen.  Super happy and we will definitely recommend this little place. Enjoy!
Monta is my go to ramen spot here in Las Vegas. Small and cozy, very nice intimate setting. This place hits the spot on a cold Las Vegas night. I frequent this spot every other week, and not once have I been served anything below standard. It's so good my heart goes insane whenever someone mentions we should go get Ramen. I want to cry when I'm done. I get so full after a meal there that I usually don't need to eat anything for hours. . . Having a small menu guarantees the food is quality and fresh. No nonsense of having a hard time trying to figure out what you want to eat. The soup is hearty and filling, the chashu topping is so amazing, nicely sliced. I always get egg with my ramen and a cold beer. Aside from the ramen, the fried rice is amazing, gyoza is on point. . . Not a good place for big parties, tables usually fit four, and there aren't a lot of tables. They also don't take reservations. Personally, I prefer to eat at the bar, facing the chefs in the kitchen. So I can stare and watch and drool waiting for my food... WAITING.... Speaking of waiting, you don't need to wait long. Food comes out of the kitchen very fast.. . Writing this review is making me upset, I want to go and eat more ramen.....
Tiny restaurant, but the food is really good!  Prices are affordable too.  I went with my BFF last night close to closing time.  She ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I ordered the chashu bowl.  The chashu bowl comes topped with nori, and the next day when I ordered takeout I definitely asked for it to be left off.  BUT the chashu is almost perfect - melty and tender on your tongue with the sweet soy-laced warm rice.  The only places I've had better chashu was in Japan and at a specific restaurant in the Bay Area, CA.  I tried the ramen, and it's good though too salty for my tastes.  The chashu bowl was worth driving out for though, and the next time we are in Vegas we will definitely stop by.
Monta is by far the most amazing ramen house in Las Vegas! I stumbled upon it and decided to take my wife and two kids (4 and 2) to give it a try. Last week we tried another Ramen house down the street from Monta and it was nowhere near as good. We've had ramen in Japan, Hawaii and California and Monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of Tokyo. . . We started out with Kimchee and the fried rice. They were both amazing! The Kimchee had an amazing taste and the fried rice was probably the best I have had! I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, my wife had the miso ramen and my kids shared the cold noodles. All had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. The dishes were bursting with flavor! My kids pounded the cold noodles and the fried rice.. . Overall, Monta is a MUST TRY when in Las Vegas. This is going to be a regular spot for us. Oh, the place is really small... So don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. You'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. Enjoy!
I am a true ramen foodie: lived in Japan for 16 years. The ramen at Monta is the same quality as the instant cup ramen I buy in Japan. The chashu is tender, but too fatty and the noodles are not of restaurant quality. . The last time I was here, I found a sign on the door asking customers to close the door behind them quickly for their AC system was not keeping up. On a hot 106 degree day in Vegas, the last thing I want to do is eat hot ramen in a hot restaurant. The place was definitely a little too warm. Beware!
Small cozy place. It was busy when I came (maybe because it was lunch time). The waiting wasn't that bad, even the waitress skipped me twice since I was dining alone :(  everything was fast and nice. Love the food here :) will come backif I have chance
Hands down some of THE best ramen I've ever had and I'm from Hawaii where we have some awesome ramen places. I got the shoyu ramen. The broth really makes it delicious! Its not too salty which is perfect! Also, the bamboo shoots and mushrooms in it were amazing! The restaurants a small and we went around 5 and it was slowly getting packed, but the food comes out fast so service is speedy. I probably wont go anywhere else for ramen in Vegas ever again!
I have to agree with all 1100+ Yelpers that resulted in the hight rating of this place. No joke on the long lines, food is worth the wait, etc etc. just wanted to share my pictures (not like you need any more)
Had heard really great things about this place and had eaten at Ramen Tatsu the weekend before. I have to say, this place did not live up to the review hype. Don't get me wrong, the soup here is good, but not amazing. The broth is much fattier than the broth at Ramen Tatsu and I did not like that. It's also much more crowded and noisy, neither of which I like. I'm not sure id go out of my way to go back.
We came here on a Friday night at 6 pm, and had to wait for less than five minutes to get a seat. That said, the place is incredibly small, and we had to sit at the bar. There are maybe four tables total (besides the bar). . . As far as food goes, the menu is very simple. I had the miso, and my fiance had the tonkatsu. We ate with another friend, an all ordered pretty different toppings, which the waitress all put down in front of the wrong people. Not a big deal, but the server didn't seem to know what she was serving. The ramen was good, but honestly I'd prefer Ramen Tatsu (especially because of the wait time and size of restaurant).
First time I've been to a Japanese Ramen shop and it was delicious.  My only point of reference is Vietnamese Pho and this was up there with the best Pho I've had.  Great, efficient service and very inexpensive as well!  Perfect for the day-after hangover that Vegas will give you!
Just like their other location in Henderson (their 2nd location is the one where I had my first Monta experience) this ramen is pure crack.  This is hands down the best, sticky, greasy, porky, al dente, delicious ramen I've had.. . Pure crack. . . I now hit up Ramen, as well as In-N-Out, everytime when visiting family in Vegas...
Always delicious. Usually a wait, but worth it. Ramen and a small order of Pork belly rice.always delicious ... We always take visitors here and they always love the ramen.
Spicy ramen was pretty good. Noodles were on point. But the broth could have been more hot. Other than that, I give it a thumbs up! Will come back next time
First and foremost I would like to say that the food here is absolutely incredible. The fried rice and the tokontsu shoyu are a must with every visit. It's the service that makes them lack from a full 5 stars. I have been here multiple times and have never had any issues however tonight out server Chizuru gave us some of the rudest service.. We ordered fried rice to share and she basically threw it at our table without giving us an extra plate or silver wear and had some major attitude when I asked for what she lacked in giving us. Not once after we got our food did she ask how we were doing, however the cute girl with the glasses and long ponytail who wasn't even our server made sure we were okay. I will ultimately return for more ramen because it is amazing I will just hope Chizuru gets an attitude adjustment before then!
Monta WOW!. . I've read a ton of reviews about Monta Ramen, and have been wanting to try it for ages. . . *confession*. I've never had anything but instant ramen before. . . We had to wait for about 30-40 minutes for a table...the place is tiny, and packed full of people happily enjoying the ramen and other deliciousness.. . We had the shoyu(chicken broth with thick wavy noodles), tonkotsu shoyu (pork and chicken broth with thin noodles), and the kuro (pork broth with a garlic oil).  . . All three were good, although I think I like the shoyu better.  Mine (tonkotsu shoyo) was great at first, but the more I ate, the saltier it tasted.  Being on a limited sodium plan, it was a little much for me, but it was still delicious.  The kuro was good, but it was better with the thicker noodles. . . Service was quick and polite. . . I really enjoyed my first ramen bar, and look forward to going back again.
Raman!! Raman!! Raman!! What more can I say!! Quick fix that does it right!! Place serve tonkatsu, shoyu, miso and tonkatsu/shoyu broth!! Delicious either way! Add more topping! And wow.. I was amazing with the flavor that was instantly put in my mouth! Come to this little spot for a quick japanese raman fixture! Try their pork over rice..- fatty! Goodness over rice :D!!
Totally overrated,the cashu was totally fat . that's why it's tender.that how they keep lower the price everything was salty, too much . I've lived in Hawaii for 5 years, I know what the good ramen taste like. They should put more bones not fat in soup base.
I give 2 stars for the food and one star for the service. Food is very average, not spicy... has no flavor.. Service is way below average. I asked substitute fish for scullions in my salad. In the end I got no fish and no scullions. Also, I asked server to put a fork in my order to go. She said that she did that. When I opened my bad I found out I don't have any fork.. Anyway I will not come back in this place.
OMG, the Tonkatsu Ramen....this broth is what my dreams are made of!!! It's extra fatty and creamy and aromatic, and it goes with the ramen noodles perfectly. The balance in flavors here is phenomenal. The bowls come out piping hot and perfect!. . If you don't like feeling your arteries clog as you eat, you can go for the Miso Ramen or a mixed broth ramen (which have a different flavor profile, but are also wonderfully paired with the ramen noodles). . . Tip: get the extras! The pork is DELICIOUS, and if you like eggs with runny creamy yolks, order the flavored egg :) . . Also, this is a tiny little ramen shop reminiscent of Daikokuya in downtown LA.....the wait/line can be super long....but the turn-around time is pretty fast because the little shop gets so hot you'll want to leave as soon as you're done eating!
Great food, attentive staff, fast service. Expect a long wait Friday and Saturday nights to be seated.....especially if its a rainy day perfect for noodles.
The dumplings were good but everything else was meh seating is not very comfortable restaurant was extremely hot Service was okay but the restaurant was very busy restaurant seemed overhyped to me
I'm so sad to give them this rating. Monta has the best ramen in town, but not this monta. Their chasu was really chewy and I was surprised. The space is really small and it gets crowded. The chairs at the bar were really uncomfortable. And they seated like 3 parties before we sat down when we were there before all of them!!! I usually crave monta and love it, but it's the Eastern location that has my heart. I asked nicely if they had the chasu buns here and the lady was rude and said "no we don't." It was just a question. Anyway, probably won't be going back to this monta again. Sad because it used to be a favorite. Looks like I'll stick to the one in Henderson with nicer staff and better quality food. Ta ta for now!
