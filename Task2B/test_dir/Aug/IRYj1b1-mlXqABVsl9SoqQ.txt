Extremadamente recomendado ! You can't leave Vegas without coming to this place... Debes de probar las de tripas y las quesadillas y obviamente con todo!!!
Good and cheap. The place to be for overnight Mexican taco fix. Walking distance from the Wynn.
Horrible service at this particular location! I've been in Tacos el Gordo in San Diego and in Mexico and I never experienced the constant harassment of the cashier to pay for my food. When I got there, she told me how to order and then to bring back my food and pay for it. Good, I got it! However, I ordered some tacos and while I was waiting in a table for the carne asada fries for my boyfriend, she again approached me to tell me that I had to go and pay for the food. I told her I was still waiting for my order and she said " yes, I know but you still have to go and pay at front" anyways, we got our carne asada fries wrong! Because we told the lady twice not to put sour cream on it and she did. We told her but we didn't wanted to wait another 15 minutes because my tacos were already cold. So, I stayed at the table and my boyfriend took the food to the cashier and paid. He came back to bring the food and left to grab some soda so I started eating and the cashier approached me for the third time to tell me that I had to pay for the tacos, I was so mad!!!! I didn't even looked at her but I told her that we already did, she demanded the receipt and I told her that I didn't have it because my boyfriend paid for them, and she asked me where he was!!!! So I told her, I was very uncomfortable and I didn't enjoyed my food at all. I left the place and while my boyfriend was looking for me he heard the cashier talking to the security about me! That I left without paying, until my boyfriend told her that I was with him. She didn't even apologize, she just said that is because a lot of people leave without paying. Awful customer service because you can't judge based on other people's bad behavior. Besides, if you're new to this place, there are three different lanes which are very confused due to the amount of clients allowed that over reaches it's maximum capacity! We got there at 11 am and got our food 45 minutes later! The food it's not worth the wait, if you're really hungry go somewhere else!
So I constantly heard people talking about how amazing this taco shop is, and I had to try it. The lines are outrageous, and it is set up as a cafeteria style where you stand in line, get your food & then you pay. The taste of the tacos were absolutely amazing, however, I paid $2 for a  taco about the size of my hand. After eating 2 of them, & an order of fries, I couldn't honestly say I was full. Overall, would rate as average.
I went to Tacos el Gordo a couple of weeks ago because of the other yelp reviews and just had to add my 2 cents. This place has absolutely fabulous authentic taco stand food! I do have to say that I did subtract a star for the fries. I shared the adobada fries and the fries were a little limp and weren't really cooked long enough. But the adobada was wonderful! I wish I had just gotten the tacos or a burrito instead and skipped the fries.  I also had a carne asada taco that was just perfect. Overall, the food is really, really good. It can get a little hectic when it is busy, but not overly so, I don't think and I think the separate lines, besides being a necessity for the different items, also speed the process. The check out process could be a little more efficient as far as getting from the food lines to the check out, but they have two cash registers, so that is helpful. I am going back tonight because this is one of those places that once you have been, you keep thinking about when you can go back.
Hands down the best and. Most authentic tacos and quesadillas on the Las Vegas strip! No contest
Very good food here,but the line is very long sometimes and takes forever to get your food, thats why I had to take off 1 star.  But I will be back when I get that craving
Cheap and fresh, can't beat this place. Very authentic but very long lines. The food is all fresh and tasty.
I still remember seeing this place when it first opened and witnessing how its evolved into this taco juggernaut. The space got bigger, they added outdoor seats, and now the crowd is out of control.  Midday Saturday I waited 15 minutes for food. Can't imagine what its like peak times.  Same recos - spicy pork is solid, almost like chinese bbq pork. Lengua is good too. Spicy pork fries are $10 and massive enough will feed an army of children (or hungry men,  whomever you have). Even the half size lengua fries are massive, but the pork is better,  unfortunately only comes in large.
First timer? It'll get a little confusing ... There are separate lines for the different types of meat and for the fries. Pick the line for which meat you want most (it'll be a problem if you want different types of meat unless someone in your party is already waiting in that line). Tell them what you want for that meat (taco, mulas, quesadilla, etc). Grab your order and go to the register to the right and pay for what you ordered.. . Thankfully I came with two people who had already been here and showed us the ropes! I ordered the adobada (spicy pork) quesadilla ($4). I'm pretty sure what I got was not a quesadilla. Not sure if the guy knew what he was doing? It was a taco with a small piece of crispy circular tortilla on top.. not pressed together or anything just thrown on top. We asked him what that was and he had to tell us it was the quesadilla. Very confused.. The flavors were good though. Ask for grilled onions (they give you green onions) and chili. . . Parking can be somewhat of a behind depending on when you come. Many of the parking spots in front of the other tenants have parking just for their store. We came during random hours at 2:30pm and the place was still pretty crowded.
I personally don't like this place. I've been to a place where the meat is top notch quality and  has no nerves so this place doesn't really stand up.
This is one of my favorite places to eat tacos in San Diego, the quality of the food at this Vegas location is not the same.  The sauce used on the adobada tacos lacks flavor, the meat is cut into small cubes vs strips like in San Diego. The  tortillas are cold.  This place is just too busy, I think it suffers because of that. If you are craving an OK taco, then this place will do just fine.  The wait is not worth the taste.
Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I'm all about the carne asada, but don't bother with that stuff at Tacos El Gordo. Go with the adobada, hands down. The meat is tender and juicy, the avocado sauce is creamy and full of flavor, and the salsa has a decent kick.. . I've been here twice and I'm only giving it 4 stars because the food didn't seem as fresh the second time around for whatever reason. The meat was a little cold and the fries were a bit undercooked. Also, they were a bit stingy with the meat on the adobada fries and they went overboard on the cheese and sour cream. Regardless, if you visit Las Vegas, try to make time to hit this place up. It can get busy during peak hours, so keep that in mind if you're running a tight schedule. The first time I went, we probably spent a good 30-40 minutes standing in line waiting for food.
Got a tip from a friend about this place. Great down and dirty taco shop just like the ones you would find back in Santa Ana. Good food, good prices. You can't beat a great $2 taco. Bring a few beers or get a couple cold ones next door. It's the simple things in life that make you smile the most.
DAMN these were some tasty tacos!!!! My buddy and I were extremely hungover while visiting Vegas and we kept on hearing about Tacos El Gordo. So we decided to take a walk to find this gem.and it was well worth it. At $2 a taco its a steal. The pastor and carne asada are bomb.com and I highly suggest checking them out for yourselves. They even have whipped juices in which they taste like a familiar chain drinks orange whipped juice w/ banana..... that is all. Enjoy!!!
Been eating at this place since they were only in TJ, Mexico 15+ yrs. Great back in the day ... Still great today. Can't wait until they set up shop in Los Angeles.
This place was so disgusting. Im not even a picky eater but my parents and sister got tacos. The meat had a lot of marble and cartilage. I had the carne asada fries and they where cold and soggy from the beginning. No veggies at all, nit my sort of place, sorry.
Good tasting food I agree so it deserves better than the worst rating. . Here's why I will never go there again:. Too crowded. The place is too small, I ran into several people and there is no room to walk even outside in seating area. We went there at 5:00 so only waited for 1 customer in front of me.. No air condition swamp coolers instead. Rabid flies especially outside. Seriously smokey from the cooking. Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red. When grabbing a tray to place food on it my hand came in contact with something sticky. There was so much going on in the kitchen I'm not sure what I saw but there was blood. I'm pretty sure on the floor.. My girlfriend got sick a couple hrs after eating. . I have been to Tijuana 5xs and this place is just as dirty. But dirty in a bad way. . The health department may send them back
Best Tacos in all of Vegas, best flavor you won't be disappointed with the quality of tacos el Gordo. Clean place great food. You must try tacos de al pastor or vampiros de al pastor. Busy place with long lines to get you're tacos but over all a great taco shop better than any other pace in Vegas.
Best tacos I've ever had! Al pastor is amazing! Cooks are great! Fast and friendly but I can't say the same for the cashiers. They are not friendly and not helpful but I still eat here anyways cause I usually don't go back to a place if the whole staff isn't friendly but the cooks make up for it. Also the place is very clean. A must if you like street tacos!
Delicious food but stupid restaurant organization and layout. There are 4 different lines you have to get in depending on what protein you want. Doesn't make any sense after waiting 15-20 minutes in line just to be limited in what you can or can't get. Frustrating experience!. . But damn it, the food is bomb. The tacos, quesadilla, and the cam-something fries all hit the spot. I would happily eat here again now that I know how to work this system.
Lengua (cow tongue) tacos were so soft and delicious, but I would skip the adobada (spicy pork) because the meat was so tough. . . It's really interesting inside the place becausethey have separate lines for everything. I guess it makes sense since they're so popular! But that means that you have to stand in line multiple times if you want different types of tacos/fries. The asada (beef steak) line was the longest (went straight out the door and started going against the side of the building) and the adobada was the shortest. Almost no line for the cashier, though! It does get really crowded in there and there are no designated exit doors, so be careful not to drop the food you waited ~15 minutes for!
I loved their Adobada tacos. When you take a bite of the taco the sauces they put on top of the taco makes it that much better. I only gave it a 3 star because there are ALOT, I mean ALOT, of flies. I was trying to swat away the flies as I was eating which made me so annoyed. If there were no flies I woulda gave it 5 star.
My favorite spot to hit up after a day at EBC! . . When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!. . Here's how it works: there are different "stations" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.  . . I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.. . BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!
My life will never be the same. Hands down best taco I have ever had. Truely authentic. With our limit Spanish my group and I weren't sure what we were ordering,the beautiful thing....it didn't matter, everything we order was amazing. Fast, friendly, affordable and the best tasting taco ever.
This place is pretty bomb. It's exactly the same tacos that you would find if you were living in Guadalajara. I think I spent $14 for 4 tacos and a drink though, so i could be a bit pricey.
Really!! Uughhh!! Never again!! So we paid $13 for a taxi to take us to this place because according to yelp reviews these tacos are suppose to be the bomb!! Guess what!! They are crap!! My husband and I had carne asada and Al pastor tacos!! The asada has the fake grilled taste and the Al pastor did not taste like Al pastor it just had the Al Pastor color but no taste!! The tortillas are hand made but the meat that goes on top of the tortillas suck so no point in having hand made tortillas!!  Best thing there is the fountain drink!! I think all the people that say these tacos are good must go when they are drunk!! Because Everyone knows that any tacos taste delicious when your drunk!! So if your sober don't waste your time or your taxi fare!!
Let me just tell you... adobada tacos.... BOMB.. . It's great authentic mexican food. Super yummy. It gets really busy at times but service is super fast. You just stand in front of the line depending on which type if meat you want. I would suggest standing in the adobada line!!! . . My friends and I always come here late nights. . If you want mexican food I would come here!. Better than Fausto's and Roberto's. :). . 5 stars for sure!
The logistics of this place are stupid and deserve a 1 star, but the food is 5 stars all the way! My San Diego family has got me hooked on Tacos El Gordo.. I can only get it when I visit them.  You can imagine my surprise and happiness to find they have a location in Vegas! I sure did walk 20 minutes from my hotel in the scorching hot to eat me some adobada and asada tacos. By the time we got there, we were so ready. Then to our dismay, we opened the door to find the line up to the door, almost out the door. Darn! So we got in the line that looked shortest and waited. And waited more. As we got closer, our hearts sank.  We noticed that there were separate lines depending on types of meat.  I wanted asada and adobada, which meant I had to stand in line twice! Then if you want a drink, it's a separate line. Fries? Separate line. LAME! I don't remember San Diego locations being so asinine! So we split up and got into the lines we needed and placed orders for each other. The lines were about 15 minutes each... so I can't imagine 1 person wanting to do the not so unusual act of ordering more than one thing..they'd be there all day! Oh and then there is a separate line to pay.  Basically, don't come here starving, because it'll be awhile before you eat. Not to mention the place is friggin packed, but that's only because it's so good. . . But let me tell you, when you finally do get to eat, it'll be the best tacos you ever had. You'll probably overeat and not regret it. You'll wonder why you ever thought Taco Bell tacos were actually tacos.  I was definitely on my gordita status that day and it was well worth it.
I'm keeping this review short and simple. OMG!!! I just had the best adobado tacos!!! It's kind of good that it's on the strip somewhat from where I live or else I'd be here a lot. I will definitely be coming back.
Probably the closest thing to TJ tacos you can find. Definitely try the adobada meat!! Also not a lot of seating so stay away from peak times.
lines are too long
Had been here many times before and this place HAD become oneof my favorite places to eat while in LV. Not anymore. Arrived there and waited in line, ordered adobada tacos. Also ordered a couple lengua and tripas tacos. The taco guy was rushing and did not get my complete order. Once I let him know he lectured me for the next 2 minutes about giving him the complete order the first time (which I DID!) and ordering other types of tacos at the other lines. I agree with the other comments about the layout being horrible. So after being lectured, waited and waited and finally found a table to sit at and eat. AND then, found a long gray hair in my taco. Just great!!! GRRR. Needless to say, I was disgusted after that. Finished my other tacos. A MINUTE had gone by when one of the employees that cleans tables asked if we were done eating because there was other people waiting for a table. NOT A MINUTE had passed since I finished chewing for God's sake!!!!! Who does that???!!! Believe me, I knew people were waiting for a table and no I did plan on sitting there for hours! Just simply bad experience!
Recomiendo ampliamente este negocio, riquisimos tacos de carne asada, cabeza, chorizo, nopales azados para los vegetarianos, no olviden probar las mulitas con cualquier carne, tienen cebollitas azadas. la atencion es rapida pero va mucha gente a comer y hay que hacer fila, para cobrar es un poco tardado, un poco compliacada la organizacion porque tiene varias lineas para pedir los tacos, un una pides azada, en otra la comida al pastor, en otra la comida preparada al vapor, pero no te preocupes, llegando con el taquero el te puede pedir algunos taquitos de la otra linea, cuando regrese a Vegas seguro pasare por alli, todos son muy amigables.
I didn't get anything to get here because I was recovering from food poisoning. But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.. . However, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long. . . As we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times. It feels like there has to be a better way for them to do this!
Adobado Tacos: Enough said.
Yum yum and more yum. Can't go wrong with spicy pork tacos here! Tacos are authentic here. Gets pretty crowded but the lines go pretty quick! Everyone wants to chow down on some tacos after a night of drinking.
The set-up makes better sense after it's explained to you.  The lines are different because of the types of meat they serve.  Everything pork to the left, beef in the middle, and everything else on the right.  I can see how things would get chaotic if you want different items though.  . . Luckily, we came in during off-peak time, 3 in the afternoon, and were able to try the spicy pork, and a few others.  I liked the sopes the best because of the gooey layer of cheese.  Yum!. . Some of the meats weren't as flavourful as I had hoped so we slathered on some spicy salsa which still wasn't all that spicy.  Go figure.  All in all, it was a pretty good snack and for the price, worth the trek.  . . That pineapple-coconut drink was so good!  Pina Colada.  Double yum!. . 3.5 stars, but rounding up to 4.  The service was so friendly and helpful.
good tacos - but if you want more than one type of meat, you have to get in two different lines - which is rather silly.  . . The food was great - watch out if you have an avocado allergy, as they put a thin guacamole sauce on everything - but the taco was great!
