I have elevated my experience to a 5 star. . First experience was ok but it could have been better. Tonight their service was on point. We had calamari again which is pretty tasty. I sampled a Sam Adams beer and a sassy blue sky mixed drink. I had the BLT ( best ever!) my daughter had the tomato soup (souper yum) my mom had the split pea (creamy and meaty), my dad had the scallops which he enjoyed and my husband went with the steak and ale pie which was also a thumbs up! Decor is still very pleasant. We were introduced to the head chef who is obviously very passionate about his work. The atmosphere was bustling but we were well taken care of and had a very nice experience.
Great dinner! Made reservations for a late dinner and we were seated promptly. We both started with the onion soup which was the best we both have ever had. My wife had the fish and chips which she said were also the best she ever had, I had the beef burger, which was delicious and much better than the burger we had at his burgur restaurant at planet hollywood. Food is not cheap so be prepared but it's a celebrity chef so expect to pay for the name in front.
Ate here twice over the last weekend, the second time with a group of friends. . . On the first visit I had the Ramsay's Tonic (a decent drink, but a hefty $15 price tag), and the Shepherds Pie. The Shepherds pie was delicious. . . For the second meal a friend and I shared the meat plate, which was pretty tasty, just enough for a two person appetizer. I had the bangers and mash, and he had the chicken. The bangers and mash were ok, the gravy was pretty delicious, and fortunately not over-salted. My friend liked the Chicken but didn't finish it. Several other friends showed up and all had the NY steak, which none of them were particularly fond of. . . My friend and I had two drinks each, the meat plate, and the two entrees. The total was $141.00...OUCH.. . Service was decent both times, but the food is just too expensive to justify eating here. It just wasn't that good. If I'm in Caesars again I'll be eating at MESA for these prices.
The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. Gordon is so judgmental on all of his shows, which is why I wanted to go and see for myself if he backs up what he preaches. He absolutely does. The decor was great, the staff was very friendly, the cocktail was amazing, and the food was cooked to perfection.
I never use this account to leave reviews, but this was just SO BAD. I love Gordon and all his shows, so this was a major disappointment. As we were walking in, we heard a couple sending their food back. My family and I should've taken the hint and left right then.. . They don't give you any bread, which for the price of basically $30 a plate I expected some. I got the salmon cooked "medium", but when it came, it was not only half the size of my palm but it was also raw. I felt like I was eating sushi. Not worth the price tag at all. My mom got a hamburger cooked "well done", but when it came, it was bloody and raw. When she sent it back, it came seared on the outside with the inside exactly the same. It was still raw and bloody. She sent it back a second time and told them not to bring it back. My brother got the scallops that were so flavorless he named it the worst he ever had. My dad's chicken was okay, but the mash potatoes he paid 11+ for were completely flavorless. . . The only halfway decent thing I had was some French fries that were supposed to be truffle fries but only had salt on them..... Couldn't properly enjoy them though because both my and my mothers ketchup had strange black pieces of god knows what in them.. . Honestly save your money and go to mcdonalds if you want some fries.
This place is very expensive at practicaly 30$ a plate. I ordered the scallops which had no flavor. The portions were small. I ordered a side salad with my meal which would have been alright if they wouldnt have drenched it in lemon juice which was pratically unedible. The service was horrible they left 2 dishes that my family had ordered in the kitchen until we told them they forgot our food. Im personally very dissapointed and personally would never return.
I recommend the salmon with fennel, asparagus, and mushroom, "Nicely seared with the right amount of crisp on the skin and well seasoned!" :-) cocktails here are great I had the Goodbye Blue Sky (I believe it was called that) cocktail....."Two!" Lol. The truffle fries are delicious and "WHATEVER" they give you in  that bread basket is delicious! :-) This restaurant is a "MUST TRY!"
The food was good, but it was outrageously expensive.  We ordered fish and chips (excellent), a hamburger (ordered medium, which was practically raw), soft pretzels (quite nice!) and bacon wrapped dates.  The food was good, but not really much better than what you would find at any brewpub across the country.  Certainly not worth what we paid, however, that could be a Vegas thing and not a Gordon Ramsay thing.
"As filming [Kitchen Nightmares] comes to a close on the latest series of Kitchen Nightmares I've decided to stop making the show," Ramsay wrote on his website. "I've had a phenomenal 10 years making 123 episodes, 12 seasons, shot across 2 continents, watched by tens of millions of people and sold to over 150 countries. It's been a blast but it's time to call it a day.". . DON'T STOP TOO SOON... you have one more restaurant to fix up... this one!. . Worst Gordon Ramsay experience we've ever had (and the first bad experience so maybe that's why I'm taking it so hard).. . 1.  Our experience started as the hostess walked us through a reasonably open restaurant: past the "patio", past the bar, past the really nice booths, and all the way to the very back of the "family room"... where one might imagine the staff eats.  What's up with that; do we not fit your preferred demographic or is there some other reason why you did this to my family?  I'm curious; really.. . 2.Waitress seems to have trained at the local Denny's.  If you were here, Chef Ramsay you'd tell that 'fat cow" to EffOff.  Ordered drinks and food.  Food got delivered (shockingly fast), then the drinks.  Not relaxing at all.. . 3.  Fish and chips... let's talk about this please.  I'm in no way qualified to tell you how to cook, but these fish and chips were fish and fries.  I've had plenty of fish and chips in the UK, both in pubs and from small shops... and once from a place so small they didn't even have electric refrigeration.  Really... fries pretending to be chips on a plate of fish and chips???  I've seen you rip people new a-holes for misrepresenting food like this.  Oh... and we never tasted the mushy peas.  The expeditor forgot them, the runner didn't notice that the expeditor forgot them, and the waitress... well she was out to pasture and didn't notice much of anything.. . 4.  Shepard's Pie... let's chat some more.  Served "bare naked" it was a disappointing sight from the moment it landed on the table.  Mash was barely browned and no garnish at all.  No visual appeal and no olfactory appeal either.  As I ate all I could hear was you saying "season, season, season" as you prepare to send a MasterChef contestant home for serving bland food.  Whoever the donkey is that cooked my pie... please ask him to return the apron and leave.  Please.  And those straight-sided dishes sure did make eating the mince and veg a frustrating experience.. . 5.  Manager was finally summoned.  I was unhappy.  He was polite and kind but had an "excuse" for almost everything.  Fries rather than chips: "you can order real chips on the appetizer menu" and when asked again "well, this is a Ramsay-twist; Las Vegas twist on a pub."  WTF does that mean... that you can call chips fries because we're not in the UK?  I think not.  He did the best he could to make things right and comp'd a couple of desserts to make up for the missing mushy peas.  But days later all I can remember is that we didn't have the kind of experience we should have had.. . 6.  Oh, and let me not forget to mention... the table next to us was set for guests, but there were chips -- errr... fries, I mean -- on the floor, presumably from the last diner.  EVERYONE walked past them, over them, and past them again.  I had the pleasure of looking at squished fries on the floor as I ate my meal.  I know, I know it is my own fault: I looked (and looked again).  Manager verified that they were fries and not chips... then took 15 minutes to get them cleaned up.  But cleaned up they were... eventually.. . 7.  Now that I've vented my spleen let me compliment a few things:  salmon was very good.  The fish on the fish-and-fries was good too.  Desserts were excellent.. . Please forgive me, Chef, for having such an attitude but it is you who inspire me and you who keeps bleating "standards"... and I totally agree.  Standards are everything and should be maintained at all times.  I only wish they were maintained for me during our visit to your PUB.
08/03/14- It was a girls trip to Vegas and I was more excited about our lunch at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill than I was for most of the activities we had planed! Sadly our experience was no where near exciting. We ordered drinks and our 1st course, which was all incredible and, when our 2nd course was brought out, one of the persons bringing the food accidently knocked over one of our drinks. Sadly I got the brunt of it, because it spilled all over my pants, shirt and purse. They were quick to come and clean it up, and we asked to be moved to a different table, which they accommodated. No one apologized for this mishap and, we had to ask to have the drink replaced that was spilled; especially since it was barely drank. Strangely, our server even seemed surprised that we would ask to have our drink replaced?! We finished our meal and then came time for dessert. I wanted to have the sticky toffee pudding, but asked the server whether it had nuts in it because I have an extreme allergy, and she stated no it did not. I ordered it as well as ordered the warm pretzels to go so that I could enjoy them on my flight home. Sadly both the sticky toffee pudding and pretzels were both brought out in to go containers, which I was disappointed because presentation is everything; and slightly felt as if this the restaurants was of asking us to leave. I began eating the pudding and, after my second bite I found something that I wasn't sure if it was a nut or a pod of some sort. When the server came over to ask how my dessert was, she noticed that it was in a to go container and just laughed, but did nothing to rectify it. I asked her what the "thing" was that I found in my dessert? She said again that there weren't any nuts but she didn't know what it was that I had found, but would go and ask the chef and let me know. A few minutes later another server brought out a dessert for another person at the table and, I asked if there were nuts in the dessert and he stated yes he thought so, but would confirm. He came back a few minutes later and stated that yes there were nuts and, it was made in a facility with nuts. I asked him to take the dessert away as well as could he have the manager come and talk to us. I was confused by the statement "made in a facility with nuts"? Was this server telling me that this dessert wasn't made on the premises; was it frozen and just reheated on site? Isn't this something that ALL high end restaurants tout that you should NEVER do? Our server came back and told me that the other server was wrong and that there were no nuts, but she never told me what it was I found in my dessert. The manager never came by our table, but when the server brought our bill, she said she took off my dessert and the other dessert that was brought for one of our guests. While that was nice to have done, I didn't eat my dessert so of course it would have been taken off! As we were walking out of the restaurant I asked the hostess if the manager was even in house, since we had never seen him/her. She stated yes, but there were busy doing payroll, but she could get them if we REALLY needed to speak them.. . To say that I was disappointed with my visit was an understatement. While the food was very good, the experience was terrible. This was not a cheap meal so I would think there should be a standard to finer dining. Due to this reason I will not ever go back to this restaurant as well as not recommend it to anyone. I have seen Gordon Ramsay's show and thought he had a high standard for not only food, but experience and, if I were him I would be embarrassed to have my name on this restaurant.
4 stars mostly due to the cocktails and beer selection at this Pub. . . I am not sure if Chef Gordon realizes what he has going behind the bar but between Adam Rains (also the beverage editor of Las Vegas Food and Beverage Professional magazine) Adam O'Donnell (Voted best bartender in Vegas by Vegas Seven and Bols Bartending Academy) Raul Faria (Host and creator of Mixology Made Simple), Ray Ray, Gene and a few others, this "pub" has created a great cocktail program. . . While I have had the pleasure of being served by almost everyone above, I have had the most experience with Adam Rains including on this most recent trip.. . Adam is one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met when it comes to cocktails and spirits in general AND food. I have a feeling that if he had chosen to be a chef he would have been as equally skilled as he is with spirits.. . He has a collection of house made infusions and bitters that he uses as tools to create some very unique, next level cocktails but can also make you one of the best classic cocktails you've ever tasted as well. I had one or two cocktails listed on the menu but I was entirely comfortable just asking Adam to shoot from the hip and make me something unique. Every cocktail was a success. I did have the "God Save the Queen" off the menu and it was pretty tasty, everything else was a Rains original I believe. I go here for the cocktails, the food is secondary to me but I have never had a bad experience. . . That being said, I have never had anything bad here, it's just everything seems so heavy. I know I know English Pub fare. I'm not flaming the food but we normally just get smaller plates throughout the course of the night at multiple restaurants and would like to see lighter options other than salad. They did  add a couple of lighter option since my last trip, the lobster roll being one of them. It was delicious, light, sweet, savory, one of the best lobster rolls I've had. We also had the wings which were wings and the pub sliders that were pretty good although we were sad to see that they changed the recipe for their deviled eggs though. The last incarnation were the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten. . . In the end, it's a great place to grab an early cocktail and a snack as they open at 11am and while I have never had anything truly amazing off the food menu it's definitely worth a stop if you want to try a Ramsay property without spending an arm and a leg or if you want to have an amazing cocktail.
The service was excellent as was the food.  The atmosphere was great as well. I would definitely recommend this place for friends or a couple. My friend and I were on a short timeline and they made sure we got out in time to see our show that we had booked. We definitely appreciated that.
No. Just, no. . . Some lowlights from our dinner tonight:. 1. Waited an hour for our food. 40 minutes in the waiter told us that he just checked on our order and they were waiting for the medium well burger to be done. Uh... what?. . 2. Gluten free salad came with croutons. . . 3. Steak ordered medium, came out overdone. Not well done, OVERdone. . . 4. Medium burger came out dry and crumbly. . . 5. One apology for steak, no apology for anything else. . . Noone in our party of 7 believed that Chef Ramsay would tolerate any part of our meal or the experience. It was profoundly disappointing, and just, aggravating. Overpriced and underwhelming. Lobster mac and cheese was meh, scallops were fine but at $32 it might have been put on a plate with something other than the chowder/sauce that the pieces sat in. Even the $15 mocha martini fell flat... small and unimpressive. The description read far better than it tasted. . . Should have read the other reviews (including the poor lady who broke her molar on rocks from the beet salad?!?) and eaten ANYWHERE else.  . . Sad, just, sad.
"Meh" is the word of the day for Ramsay's Pub and Grill. . . As a beer lover, I was most excited about the beer offerings at Ramsay's Pub and Grill, which was supposed to have 36 beers on tap, and another 63 in bottles. I make a point to seek out new brews where ever I travel. The quantity of the beer selection at Ramsay's Pub was the sole reason my girlfriend and I made the trek for dinner that night. . . I was disappointed to find out that they do not have nearly this amount of beers for sale. They still have plenty (about 30-ish), but I was hoping to find something new, or perhaps a hard to find ale from when I used to live in London. If you visit hoping to drink some great craft brews, you will be let down. They stock the usual big brands, nothing special. Unless, of course, our server with-held some secret menu that contained the rest of the beers advertised on the website? I asked about this but was told everything they had was on the menu. :-(. . As for the food, it's Vegas prices. High prices, almost too high for what they offer. I had the Steak and Ale pie, which is a staple of hearty pub food in the UK. But at $24, I suppose I expected something more than the underwhelming pie I received. I didn't think I would have to spice up a Gordon Ramsay pie with HP sauce... I've had better from UK chains like Fuller's. My girlfriend had the fish and chips, which were good, but still very expensive ($28) for what it is. . . Again, I understand it's Vegas and prices are inflated, but it just seems like too much for the food they offer. They can advertise it as "elevated" pub food, but in the end it's still just pub food and doesn't justify a $75 bill for steak and ale pie, fish and chips, and two drinks (a full draft pint is anywhere from $9-$13). . . I originally gave it 2 stars because of high prices, generally underwhelming food, and missing beer. But, the food wasn't bad, just not worth the high prices. The place does, however, have a great vibe. Lots of fun, but I would reconsider dining here again. For the price, there are better options. In fact, hundreds of options! Maybe I'll just grab a brew or cocktail at the bar next time.
I would have gave this place 1 star had the Calamari not been decent but the Shepard's pie and the chicken pot pie were not anything special I've had frozen dinners with more flavor than what I got would not recommend this place to anyone
Hate to do this..... I love Gordon Ramsay! - but...... The food here is mediocre. I have been on three occasions now with people visiting me from out of town. I kept giving it a chance, but was let down each time. . Tried something different each time and just not up to the standard of his other 2 places here in Vegas. . The Sheppard's Pie was even mediocre :( . I would go there for a beer and chat with a bartender, but if I am looking to get a quick eat than I would rather go to Burgr.. . Sorry Gordon......
Sadly, no local beers, but the bartenders are local and they rock:  personable, attentive and engaging.  What also rocks here is the music selection: Smiths, REM, Ramones. I sat at the bar and had the chicken breast. It was simple, tasty, and exactly what I was looking for: something that emphasized the protein over superflurous carbs. I'll be back.
The bf and I are avid Gordon Ramsay show watchers. We came on our first night in Vegas because we couldn't decide where to eat and this sounded as good as anything. . . We were totally stoked on the complimentary pub cheese & pretzel sticks, which were filling and delish. . . I ordered the shepherds pie which was tasty and very hearty. He ordered the fish and chips which he seemed at least satisfied by. . . I think I really wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding but I was so full by the end of the shepherds pie that it was just not gonna happen. . . I don't necessarily know that I'd go back on my next trip to LV, but I wouldn't be opposed to it either.
Just finished lunch here.  Ate in restaurant side with tables.  Great service by Joe and outstanding fish and chips with the best mushy peas I have ever had.
I wanted to BE Gordon Ramsey..... . The meal we experienced would have invoked rage in the man himself had he been served such mediocre food. . . Starting with a Scotch Eggs ($9) - Eggs are plural, meaning more than one. We were served a sole lonely egg - just one. Appearance was nice, but there were more pickled vegetables than Scotch Egg. The egg itself, which is supposed to be soft boiled, was right on the edge of hard boiled. Sausage was bland and crumbly. The hit of the dish was the mustard, yes, the mustard. . . Main course:. Mini Pie Sampling of All Three Pies ($21) - . The menu was accurate with this description - they are definitely MINI. These "pies" are more like pie sliders. Barely a taste of each for what was supposed to be my main meal. The meats and vegetables inside were perfectly cubed, which made it look like those old Swanson turkey pot pies - taste was about the same.  I could not discern a noticeable taste difference between the three, so I can't label a favorite - all were below average. . The pies come complete with a puzzle for your dining entertainment / frustration. Take note of the long wooden basket with the thick wooden dowel running the length over the pies. Trying to eat with a dowel running interference is brilliant if the point is to slow you down. Practical no, frustrating - yes. . Why didn't I simply remove the pies do you ask? The server will warn you that the ramekins are blisteringly hot.... . Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ($28) - . My petite wife scored with the largest serving size of the day! There were several nice pieces of fish, which were flaky and cooked perfectly. However, having seen Ramsey's perfect fish & chips on TV, these would also have not made the pass. The batter was not crisp - soft and pliable would be a better description. . The chips - try to find them in the photo... still looking? There are a smidgen tucked under the fish - under the fish, where they can steam and lose ALL crispiness. No crunch in the bunch. As Gordon would say, "Damn...". Ah-ha, there was malt vinegar in a little pour bottle on the table, love malt vinegar on fish & chips! Tipped the bottle and a tsunami of vinegar filled the basket, spilled over the edge and all over the table, stopping short of becoming sour perfume all over my wife lest it not for quick reflexes snapping the bottle back to attention. . . Desert....not a chance.. . Server...very animated and could tell loved his job, but once the food came, was absent until the check appeared. It seems like he was trying to cover one to many tables and a table of two obviously wasn't going to make him as much as the other larger tables that received lots of attention. If he had made the rounds during our meal, we certainly would have made our feelings regarding the food known.. . Highlights: Yes, there was one - I had a pint of the Innis & Gunn ($11) - quite pricey, but not available anywhere else in Vegas that I know of, so it was enjoyable.. . Overall, to sum up the meal and experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill Las Vegas, no arm flailing or curse words although it may have made me feel better. I am simply at a loss.... . I think Gordon himself would sum it up all to well.... . "What a shame"
Went here last and have to say it was below expectations I think Gordon Ramsey would have. They sat us we ordered an appetizer they brought it out and started giving it to the table next to us. Then we ordered food and again the guy tried to give it to another table. Fish and chips were 30.00.. There was nothing special about it. Won't be back
The best ever!  Excellent service, great atmosphere and I love Caeser's Palace.  Food had a lot of flavor and salty (I like salt).  Gordon Ramsey came out and said hello.  He was nice to us (unlike how he is to his chefs on tv).  Got a beer and Bloody Mary.  Deviled eggs were quite "devilish"
This place offers good English pub comforts (bangers and mash, Shepard pie, etc) but the real draw here is the casual atmosphere, good beer and fun waiters. Our waiter (my brother from another mother, Christopher) was awesome and took very good care of us. . . Sadly, they no longer offer complimentary bread anymore. . . IMHO, it's good food but a little pricey. But then again, you're on the strip and inside ceasars so I guess it's to be expected.
My husband and I were so excited to try one of Gordon's restaurant!  We went in there with the utmost confidence that it would be awesome.  . . The food was okay if it were a dive pub. But the prices were insane and you can get food just as good in most pubs. Vegas has way too many good restaurants to waste your time here.
Really underwhelming. My husband's pot pie was a disappointment. My onion soup was marginal. We are unlikey to try it again.
We were a party of 9. Our large group was easily accommodated - we didn't have reservations. Our waitress was very good. We had the burgers (lamb & beef), blt, wedge salad and pretzel sticks. Everything was delicious! Prices were what you should expect for an upscale pub! I recommend it!
I was not impressed at all i think Mr. Ramsay needs to keep a better eye on his place.. . 1st thing it took over 30 min for a waiter to come by for drink orders. . 2nd I found a long hair in my food. . 3rd THE RISOTTO WAS UNDER COOKED!!!. . the only thing that was good was the french onion soup
Food was ok, came here after a show and stopped by to get a bite of something. We had the fish and chips and the steak potpie.. Small serving for the price.
We dined here this past Saturday. Our server was Taylor, who was great. We were unsure of what to eat and he took time to recommend what he thought was excellent choices for us. He was very attentive. Great service makes a meal for me. The food was excellent too. I will be back for sure. Highly recommended. Good drink selections too.
We had the restaurant week lunch with the braised short rib.  The French onion soup was pretty good, but the risotto was extremely undercooked.  It was so chewy that we couldn't eat it.  The undercooked onions also were not peeled.  There was a layer of skin that we had to spit out.  The short rib was larger than I expected and very tender, but also very bland.  The best thing on the plate was the carrots because I actually like raw carrots.. . This place is a shame to any chef's name.
My expectations were a bit higher than the quality of food that i had. Quick recap:. . Bacon Wrapped Date (2/5) - Two big let downs here. First of all the size and portions were super small. 4 super small pieces for an order that cost $9.  Second disappointment was in terms of flavor, it didn't wow me at all.  At other places I've gone this dish has been a hit and I think the missing ingredient is Goat Cheese.  It's not in it over here.. . Hot lollipop wings (3/5 rating) - Northing extraordinary at all.  Just average. Lollipop wings so smaller in size as i expected.. . Mini Lobster roll (4/5 rating) - This was my favorite part of my meal and I really enjoyed it. Plenty of Lobster and the quality of the roll was perfect.
I had the pleasure of having lunch at Gordon Ramsay the Pub & Grill. The food was amazing. I ordered the fish and chips. . The cook on the fish was perfect and the chips were also perfect. I don't eat fried foods because most places don't use fresh oil or over cook the food. Not the case here. The flavors of the all the food from fish to the tarter sauce was amazing. The staff is awesome. I did have the pleasure of talking with Louie Maione the GM commending him on the food and service. What a great representative for the resturant. I highly recommend this place. Enjoy
I loved the idea of this place, I was stationed in England for a few years and love fish and chips. The three of us were greater by 5-6 hostesses that was a little awkward. All bored and chatting it up. We asked for a place next to the bar TVs however they seated us towards the back of the bar next to one TV. That was mildly frustrating as the place was dead for a labor day weekend at lunch rush. I'm guessing people are intimidated by the prices but we had cash to blow. . When the waitress addressed us she apologized for the wait as it was 10 minutes into being seated, she said she was the only server and someone called in. This was sad Bc there was 5-6 hostesses and a manager in a suit watching this whole ordeal and not doing anything about it. I wanted him to approach us and ask about the experience but he skipped our table. . . Long story summed up, the craft cocktail (Mr Tokyo or something) was like a pink lemonade with egg white froth, not good but the waitress didn't explain what it entailed.. My friend loved the blt. Other friend loved the lamb burger. The fish and chips was the biggest let down. $30 bucks for HUGE chunks of cod.. They state how awesome the batter KS but with peices so large you miss out. . . Long story short, I'd rather fly to England for $1,000 bucks, take a 40 pound cab ride to Mildenhall Village and eat at the dog track than to recommend anyone eating here. . . I'm a Vegas local and I only write reviews if I love or hate a place. The two stars is Bc I like the mushy peas
