YES!!!!! A 5 Star Airport! Super organized and clean, and everyone there seemed so happy to be working......Even the TSA! Shocker right? . Looking forward to traveling through this Airport a lot in the future!
If you enjoy leaving the heat or driving around in circles waiting for someone crazy enough to fly into the heat, this is the place for you.... . That's really all I can say about this place.
The last time I flew through PHX was the day that America West was doing their Y2K compatibility testing of their flight sensitive systems back in 1999. I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat at PHX for over 8 hours while I waited for my flight to ABQ, and then drove close to 3 hours to Gallup, New Mexico. Imagine my frustration when I realized, had I consulted a map, I could have driven to Gallup in much less time, thereby avoiding several hours of airport appreciation. PHX, I've purposely avoided you for 15 years because of this, but today was a day to let bygones be bygones.. . I needed to get somewhere, and the connection that made the most sense was through Phoenix. I flew in and had about an hour to walk around while I waited on my next flight, and made peace with the airport. . . First, it's been remodeled. Yeah, I know what your thinking, and you're right. It has been 15 years since I was here last and I would hope they would have done something since then. They have, and I was pleased. I also liked the carpet.. If you look close enough, there are little airplanes in the design. Subtle, but if you stare at the floor when your walking like I do, you'll notice it. . . I didn't see a Starbucks, which I desperately needed after catching a 6am flight from the eastern time zone, so I settled for a diet coke and found a comfortable seat to watch CNN from while I waited on my flight. Most of the restaurants I came across seemed to be local or regional places; I didn't recognize too many of the names, and they all seemed to have something to do with Mexican food. I really could have used a Starbucks. . . America West no longer exists, we aren't preparing for certain doom like we were in 1999 before the new millennium, and I didn't check any bags. All three of these contributed to my positive experience in Phoenix. PHX airport, I'm pleased we had another encounter. All is forgiven. Now, if only it were that easy to forgive Ex's...
I've been to many airports in my time and would have to say this is my home and favorite. It really embodies the beauty of Arizona. Plus all the new favorite local restaurants are plugged in here LoLo's, Jose Cuervo Restaurant (my fav) and  more. Thanks guys, I always look forward coming home. Cheers!
This airport is horrible. . . One bathroom for females in a wing of the terminal.  Fail.. . One coffee place with only two people manning the shop (which equaled to 20+ people deep waiting for a coffee).  Fail. . . Aisle ways so small and crowded that trying to walk / navigate thru the terminal.  Fail. . . Fortunately this was only a connecting airport (en route to DCA) and not one that I have to put up with daily.
Airport is showing its age...maybe I am biased as ATL is my home airport, but Skyharbor leaves a lot to be desired.
What's not to like! At 4:15 a.m. the roads are quiet, the lines are short and the sun is almost always shining. This airport serves the area well and is easy to get to from almost all of the valley. If you need coffee, your craving can be satiated in every terminal, but if you must have Starbucks, head for terminal three. The waiting areas are spacious and there are enough seats if you get there early enough. You can even get a direct flight to London's Heathrow Airport. Want to go on a cruise, just hop on a flight to Seattle and enjoy.
Decent airport, large, clean and seems to have a lot of decent restaurant options. We loved Blanco in the A-gate area!. . I've been here 3 times now - first time was a quick run through, second was a disaster in which I almost missed my flight because of crowds and confusion about which terminal to be in and this time was relatively nice cuz of the great restaurant.. The subsequent hour plus flight delay doesn't appear to be the fault of the airport, but more the fault of US Air, which I am quickly developing a healthy hatred for.
Wow, what a difference 2.5 years make!  New, local restaurants (terminal 4), sky bridge to parking, new decor, I'm impressed! Way to go Sky Harbor.  Now all you need is a popcorn shop and you'll have my heart (and 5 stars), Nuts on Clark or Garrett's would be awesome!
I have traveled in and out of PHX many times. It's always very clean and very busy.  . . They have many food options.  I will say I don't like the restaurants they added at the D gate area.  The ones prior to the remodel were much better.  But the D gate area is very open and nice.  There is a huge section of windows allowing for people to watch the takeoffs and landings.  It keeps people and children busy.  . . This airport has a couple very convenient cell phone lots.  That way you don't have to keep circling around the arrivals like a race track.  There is also a large board with flight information which tells information about each flight for each airline.  . . I have many great memories of this airport which started and ended great vacations.  So sit back, relax and enjoy your flight!
WORST AIRPORT DESIGN. If you have to change terminals then you need to get out of the airport and then go through security again. Who does that make sense?  . . Will definitely try to avoid flying thru here as much as I can.
Not a fan of this airport. Gates are such a long walk from the baggage claim, and it takes FOREVER to get your luggage (yes, one day I will learn to not check my bags).. . Decent food options, but not great. I think I'm just spoiled because I get to fly out the best airport in the country all the time....PDX.. . Sorry, PHX, not looking forward to our next meeting.
Travel through this airport regularly, great helpful people, clean bathrooms, good signage & processes.
C section was very empty when we fly out on a Monday night. Security lined moved quickly and it's a pretty clean airport. The water from the filter water refill station tasted salty and gross though.
I was in the Phoenix Airport last week while connecting from DC to ABQ. As I was asking for directions to the terminal for my connection, I was told that I would have to go outside and get on a shuttle bus. Seriously???? You're telling me I have to go outside and go through security AGAIN? Yes, that's exactly what they were telling me. Needless to say, I was not a happy camper to learn that if you connect to a different terminal you have to go BACK through security.....not fun!. . It just seems like in this day and age there has to be a better way to get travelers from one terminal to another without causing such a hassle.
Great airport with free WiFi. Lola coffee is legit. If in terminal c try some cartel coffee.
One's impression of this airport greatly depends on the location of the gate you arrive at vs. the gate you're going to depart on.. It can sometimes feel like you're never going to reach your gate no matter how long you walk.. Or to be more specific, I once had a 20 minute walk from my arrival gate to baggage claim.. and that was in business class.. I do enjoy the restaurants and other amenities.. . The baggage arrives mostly on time depending on airline.. . Pro tip: check out the Starbucks by the baggage carousels.. they brew some good beans.. Watch out for: its difficult to actually leave the baggage area,, there are a myriad of barriers and more exits than you can count on one hand.. . Big minus one star for having off-site care rental.. No one wants to have to take a not insignificant bus ride after a 5 hour flight from the east coast. . Usually at this point you hate most modes of transportation anyway (US Airways I'm looking firmly in your direction)...and having to lug your luggage up and down more times than you would need to at other airports with on-site car rentals is just not going to create a positive experience with the traveler.. . And finally, not enough power outlets for charging mobile devices!! In this day and age these should be ubiquitous! But instead, one sees tired looking business people sitting on the floor around a charging tower with the life draining out of their eyes. Actually this last bit made me change my rating from a 3 to a 2 when I thought about it.
Dress appropriate especially in the Summer!
Really great airport, and the upgrades they've made are wonderful. My only complaint is that all rental cars are off site... and even though the shuttles to the brandy-new car rental facility are running constantly, it adds about 30-40 mins. So, if you're returning a rental car, make sure you leave enough time.
Unless you are flying in and out of here don't rent a car from Dollar! The car rental took a long time although the customer service was great. It is a nightmare trying to return the car unless you are leaving on a plane. There are carts for your luggage, but the only help you will get is from volunteers. Avoid this place unless you are flying, in which case it is fine.
This is barely an intl airport. Most intl flights go through real hubs like JFK / ATL. . . Precheck is FREQUENTLY CLOSED! . . Only airport I have seen this before. Mostly amatuer travelers means super slow security. No lounges. Nowhere to work. Power outlets are barely existent.
I will admit that I've only connected through this airport a few times, but I've generally had rather positive experiences. I've managed to find some rather delicious pizza for example, found the hallways reasonably easy to navigate, and enjoyed the free Wi-fi! :) As an International traveler, I really appreciate visiting airports that have free wi-fi. I haven't managed to explore much of this airport but I imagine that as my travels take me different places every year, that I'll visit more and more often.
So even if I did have a serious issue with Sky Harbor, what am I gonna do? Use the other airport in the middle of Phoenix? Fortunately, I come from Tucson so  pretty much any airport is an upgrade by my standards. Fun fact: In We're the Millers, the 'family' flies into Tucson International Airport but the scene is shot in ABQ (same airport in Breaking Bad). So, that's how bad TIA is - even when the script calls for Tucson to be shown, filmmakers go to another state to put something palatable on the screen. . . That said, I actually like Sky Harbor. I wish the Sky Train was a little more consistent (maybe it's just been down when I had flights to catch) but the place is efficient enough and that's really all I can ask for. That they keep it clean and are putting in some decent restaurants is just icing on the cake.
I've dropped by PHX Sky Harbor a handful of times as a stop over for my flights to the East Coast these past few years. There are plenty of miscellaneous stalls along the waiting areas, including quite a few sit-down restaurants and bars. Most seem to be full lunch and post-lunch. Terminal 2 doesn't have anything special in terms of restaurants; there's a grab and go, a pizza place, and a coffee shop among other things. Terminal 3 has some sit-in restaurants and bars, but as many others mentioned, terminal 4 is getting better; there seems to be more dining options available in that part of the airport.. . Some of the staff here apparently dislike their job or interacting with people. For example, I simply asked one of the staff members on the escalators -- he was doing nothing, just leaning back with his back to the window panes -- if I was heading in the right direction to reach A6, and the guy's response was: "There's a big ass sign that shows with white arrows where the 'A' terminals are -- it's not that hard. Read." WELL, SHIT...SORRY.. . There's nothing terribly wrong with this airport. It's smaller than the others I've been to around the country, but it's expanding. Also, I must note that it's not as hectic as, say JFK, LAX, or SFO.  I'm not sure if it's because it's Arizona, but damn, it was hot inside. It was especially hot for me because I was racing to A6 after finding out that the 3:20pm US Airways flight to Newark was on-time despite their being a 30 minute delay from Fresno. If you saw a tall Asian guy sprinting to A6 on Wednesday, well, that was me.
It's a very large airport. I didn't fly but picked up my daughter.  It took her quite a while to get from the plane to the baggage claim... 15 min? Yea, it's a big airport!
Not a bad airport as airports go.  There are a number of pretty good places to eat.  What the concourses suffer from is what most airports suffer from these days.  Not enough outlets to plug your devices into.  Granted I know this is mostly controls by what airline has what concourse.  Cause if you are in Salt Lake City and use the Delta terminal they have charging stations everywhere.  Just saying, it would be great if everyone was on the same page.. . Phoenix is clean, well taken care of.  Some of the gates could use more seats, but that is a minor point.  Probably wouldn't flinch if I had to come through here again.
This airport is really nice! A lot shopping if you get stuck or bored. Food choices from fancy salads to BBQ. Sky Harbor is in my top 10 airports.
Ugh. The updates they've made to Sky Harbor in the last couple years make it seem like Phoenix is actually a fun, cool place to live. There are some misfires (El Barrio has never gotten an order of mine right yet) but there is more than enough to make up for it (Sweet Republic). The United Gulag known as Terminal 2 is still the worst place in the world to be, though. But the sky train is very convenient. Parking sucks a lot. And this is the only known La Madeleine location in the entire state. So I am begrudgingly upgrading this airport to 2 stars.
Not a great airport.. . First, our flight got delayed from 8:30 to 9:50 so we figured we had a half hour to go grab some breakfast at one of the mediocre restaurants they have in the airport.  We ate breakfast and then headed back to the gate at 9.  When we arrived, they were already boarded and the door was closed.  We asked what happened because our flight wasn't supposed to take off for another 50 minutes, and they told us they had bumped up the departure time.  But they didn't announce it!  There was no way we could have known that they bumped up the time.  The TV flight monitors still showed the departure time as 9:50!. . Second, the airport clubs they have are all a little dirty and tired looking.  And the air conditioning wasn't working in our terminal.. . Wouldn't necessarily recommend.
This airport needs some major.. something or other. . . I had a connecting flight to get to and had to run to the other side of Terminal 4. I thought I would be able to hit the bathroom before hand, but boy was I wrong. They are literally redoing every bathroom in the Terminal except 1. You know what that means ladies- lines all the way down the terminal. I wouldn't make it in time, so I had to suffer through take off until cruising altitude. It was not fun on a turbulent flight. . . The seats are not upgraded in the terminal like many other airports. There are not any plug-ins in convenient locations, like the arm rests (in other airport terminals). There are only plug-in's in the middle of walkway between the row of chairs. The people in the terminal are kind and just step over, etc. The pilots and crew members on the other hand, not so much. I had my phone charger ripped out of the ground by not 1 but 2 different crew attendants that proceeded to roll over the cord anyway. I wasn't that upset about it, I just thought it was funny that there were tons of other rows to walk down, but they kept choosing mine! haha. . . I'm not a fan of this one! But I will inevitably be back because I hate the drive to AZ more.
Like everything else in Phoenix, despite the recent upgrades it still lags behind other cities in the region. . . I actually am a fan of Sky Harbor International overall. It has vastly improved over the years and once the new light rail was up and running, it became a lot of fun for me to head out to the airport (without anyone having to take me) to catch my flights. But I have to be honest about things. This airport is a little quirky. Originally, the light rail would take you to 44th Street and Washington and from there you would take a nice air conditioned bus that would glide through to all of the terminals and work it's way back around to the parking structure and back to the bus stop across the street from the light rail stop. . . However, once the SkyTrain came on the scene Sky Harbor decided the shuttles were no longer needed to pick folks up from the light rail station. This is a mistake in my view. The reason this is important is because the SkyTrain ONLY goes to terminal 4. After that it turns around back towards the parking structure and back to the end of the line where the escalator meets the long hallway that leads to the light rail station. . . The problem is having to get off of the SkyTrain and head downstairs to the nearest shuttle stop and wait for one to take you to another terminal. There are only a few signs telling you where to catch the shuttle and so it is easy to get lost looking for where to go. Additionally, it takes much more time to get to your terminal this way. In this regard, because the SkyTrain is not complete yet (despite the city promoting it like it is) Phoenix is still behind Las Vegas, Dallas, and LA. And that is a bit annoying. . . Regarding the security lines and the TSA. They are not the slowest I've seen, but at busy hours it can be a little while before getting through. Contrast that with Las Vegas, which had many agents working to make the lines go faster and to get us all through quickly. There's a noticeable difference in our security versus others in the region. I know it isn't necessarily Sky Harbor's fault, but it does factor into how people view the airport. . . In terms of changing terminals, I've done it twice and it is a nightmare. Time consuming and because of the "Arizona-style" outdoor nature between the terminals, you will have to go through TSA security again. And that's never fun to do twice in a day let alone twice in the same airport with limited time between flights. . . The seating and overall atmosphere of terminal 2 is shabby and outdated. It is a relic of Arizona history, which shows you a glimpse into a time when Phoenix only needed a small terminal to service everyone coming and going. The bathrooms look like they are from the 1980s and it sucks to be there. Terminal 3 is slightly better, but still with outdated seats and areas where the carpet is screaming to be cleaned or changed out. And terminal 4, the flagship terminal of Arizona, well it's average at best. The food options are more plentiful than the others, but there is far more foot traffic and the seating is still only decent with few plug-ins or outlets for electronic devices. Quite far behind even an airport I was at in Guatemala. Seriously. . . Despite the criticisms I outlined here, Sky Harbor could be much worse and my flights have always been on time here. The SkyTrain will eventually be finished, thus shutting up my major gripe about the place and the people working there really are friendlier than other airports I've been to. In the end, it isn't good as Dallas or bad as LA. Just about where Phoenix always is, right in the middle. Average. Decent. Respectable, but not a threat to the current 'chain of command' regarding regional airport leaders.
Airport is very quick and friendly. Was able to get dropped off very easily at the curb and then check bags and get through security within 15 minutes. It's a holiday weekend and traffic is fairly busy, no need to get here more than an hour before hand though
Had no problems with this airport. I like the tall windows with views of the local landscape. I found people to be quite helpful. Be aware of the guys driving carts that offer to pick you up and drive you to wherever in the airport, they will hit you up for tips after you are already rolling. No big deal, I had no cash so jokes on them I guess. It was 106 degrees when I stepped out of the airport and I burst into flames. . . I actually had to eat here on my way out of town. I got a salad and a Cuban sandwich at this place in terminal 3 and it was pretty great.. . I'm not in a hurry to get back to any airport, but Sky Harbor is no stress for me.
