Along with the same inspiring performances I have come to expect from a Cirque show, this show has the added bonus of being both hot and funny. Don't miss it!
Zumanity 2014 is a shell of its former self! I first saw this show about 4-5 yrs ago and it was awesome -sexy,sultry, boundary-pushing with superb acrobatics! Fast forward to 2014- most of the sensuality and display of cirque acts have been stripped away and replaced with "dance numbers" that were just "meh" and don't invoke sensuality. Because of this I found the skits in between and "the twins" to be annoying. - one of 2 actual "cirque" acts involved an S&M theme complete with a soundtrack of orgasmic sound effects. If felt a bit awkward and out of place since little had been done to create the mood or build up to this moment. Perhaps it's time for Zumanity to get a prescription for those "blue pills"
Entertaining but I had more hopes as far as stage and decor goes after watching O. Also I don't understand why they have all dancers with small boobs. Again premium seating does not mean they will give attention to u. We were sitting in second row from the stage and seemed like they picked up people pre selected. When the girls with strawberry came they did not offer to everyone in the first couple of rows. Mixed feelings. May be they ignore people from other nationalities.
Perhaps it was bc I had a heavy dinner right before the show but I fell asleep. I've enjoyed other Cirque de Soleil shows but this one was missing something. Yes, it was quite funny because there was a wide range of talented people performing, from topless women to midgets to bisexual men. However, there was absolutely no storyline. It was a mix of random & sometimes confusing acts. It wasn't sexual as they claim, it was more on the funny side if anything. Of course, this doesn't take away from the talented individuals performing athletic acts but go see "O" instead and you'll be more satisfied.
Interesting, fun night out.  Provocative, sexually charged performance with plenty of eye-candy and bare breasts.  Worth seeing, but probably only once.  I enjoy the other cirque shows more.. . Also,.  -It's at the New York New York hotel so your options for pre/post show drinks are Italian, tex Mex and burgers...all pretty good though, but not great..  - shows are 7:30 and 10:00.  -90 min show.  - about $85-$130 tix.  - it's a small venue, so there are no terrible seats, but I'd avoid the balcony
Zumanity showcases the acrobatic abilities of Cirque du Soleil performers in short, comedic and sexual scenes. It's erotic, mysterious, hilarious, and thrilling to watch their beautiful feats of athleticism and balance. The MC is raunchy and sultry, and will make you laugh uproariously.  . . Best views are from the center of the auditorium, not the sides. Select your seat with care, as they often select "volunteers" from the couple sofas and front rows. If you live in Las Vegas, check with the box office for the local deal. If you have internet, check online, as we were able to find very reasonable prices with the anniversary offer. . . Gentlemen who are looking to ogle bosoms, keep in mind that most of the performers are petite and of athletic build. They are not particularly top-heavy, but they are definitely strategically nude.
I have been excited to see this show since about 2008. I finally got to see it, and while it was fun, it was not what I expected. It is definitely not what you typically think of when you think Cirque du Soleil. It's more of a Burlesque/Drag Show/Variety Show with some acrobatics thrown in. The best Cirque related parts of the show was the girl with the hoops and the couple dancing with the ribbons. . . The best part of the show for me, was the pre-show. It was funny and entertaining, if not embarrassing for the guests sitting front row. Zumanity while entertaining wasn't very cohesive. There seemed to be a bunch of thrown together scenes that didn't blend together as in some of the other shows.. . If you're looking for somewhat bawdy entertainment Zumanity is a good choice. If you're looking for something more Cirque-ish look elsewhere. Also - its very sexual and topless so not a good choice for families. Also beware, that if you sit in the first 2 or 3 rows, they will get you! You will be made to do silly sexualized things, possibly with strangers. So if you're uncomfortable with that sit at least 4 rows back.. . Hottest scene = the bath tub scene. . . . . Visited August 2014
Definitely a unique cirque show. Seemed a bit short considering the price (although we went for free thanks to MyVegas / Mlife). Seems most seats offer a great view, since the theater is not too large, and the seats surround the main area of the stage.. . It's worth checking out if you can go for free or at a discount. If paying full price though, some of the other cirque shows may be better. We did enjoy it though.
I saw two Cirque shows during my trip to Vegas. This was the second. The show was tasteful and the acrobatics were, as always, fantastic. As always, a few times during the show my heart dropped watching some of the stunts performed. This Cirque show was perfect for the raunchy instead of family-friendly atmosphere of most of the shows. The stunts were much more intimate than the other shows, and there was a bit for most kinks the audience could have.
This show was awesome!! Great crowd involvement and a great hostess for the show, seats were comfortable and ushers can move you to better seats if it's not packed full, just ask. This show is for adults and it's very sexual,  just relax and enjoy the show
This was an awesome show.  Saw it with a group of women but definitely recommend going with your partner!~
Wife that it was okay, I thought it was pretty bad.  Not very many acrobatic circus acts - it was more about the humor, which wasn't funny.  I do not get offended at anything, so it isn't like sexual humor bothers me.  It just wasn't funny.
This was different than the other Cirque de Soleil  shows in a sense that it's a combination of acrobatics meets stand up comedy,  all while being sexual at the same time.  I enjoyed it and was very much entertained.
Well worth the price of the ticket! The show is engaging from start to finish. My picky husband even loved the show.
Hilarious!. . I didn't expect Zumanity to be this good.  From a performance and acrobatic perspective, Zumanity can't compare to The O Show.. . Don't get me wrong, this takes nothing away from Zumanity as it makes up for it in humor and entertainment.
