This was an excellent lunch. At our table several dishes were sampled and all with rave reviews. Great service, very good food. The pretzels were awesome--trust me. Also very positivereviews on lobster roll, bangers  and mash, and the workman's grilled cheese. Skinny fries were outstanding. Yum.
The bloody Mary's are amazing! Got to love being able to build your own blood Mary from scratch! . . Happy hour is awesome!! $1 oysters!
Very nice atmosphere. They are always friendly and upbeat. The free check-in beer is awesome. I would highly recommend.  My brother and I have been here several times and have been pleased each time. They also have free peanuts for everyone.
Disappointing experience with a large group. We brought around 60 people, had a set menu planned, and they ran out of one of the appetizers. The event manager that I worked with to plan the event was not at the restaurant for our event and she was supposed to be. The manager that was working really didn't seem to care about our group. When I emailed the event manager about the issues we had, she offered a complimentary dinner for me and a guest. Yes, that's nice, but I live in a different state and this was a group event. I was not the only one that noticed the issues. This group also doesn't visit Vegas often enough for the gesture of a "free meal for two" to matter.
This place is awesome, who doesn't love free beer? I accepted the challenge to drink a pint in under 7 seconds, and killed it. However, it's extremely cold... but that still didn't stop me from doing it a second time. Highly Recommend this joint!
Alright so classy I know, but we had the corn dog puppies and lobster roll.... . Both were really good. Drinks were good. Decent happy hour deals also. . The bartenders were great. I really enjoyed the music though...I heard Korn, Alice in Chains, and Metallica while I say at the bar. There aren't many places that I've been to where I could say that. ...made me want to stay longer
3.5 stars. . This pub is easy on the eyes, and has TWO happy hours for you to catch. (3-6p or 10p-12a) Somehow, we managed to miss both. Poop!. . Should you desire one of their infamous bloody marys or bubbly drinks, make sure you seek out the table at the entrance, where a gaggle of young ladies in cowgirl getups will take your order on a checklist and bring your drink(s) to your table. You'll have the option to select your liquor, add-ins, and appetizer choices. These drinks are not found on the standard menu and are not made at the bar. . . Displayed out in front of the outside seating area is the ultimate Bloody Mary known as All about Mary. Here's where it gets a little weird. It's like they create a pupu platter of common appetizers, and arrange them above your drink so you get a single serving and taste of each item. One chicken wing, one large cocktail shrimp, one pub slider...you get the idea. It's like lunch in a drink. A genius idea, but with so-so execution. . . The drink took about 10 minutes to make because the girls had to wait for each food item to arrive from the kitchen before they could go about the tricky business of arranging it in a pint glass. The bloody mary itself was a little warm, and we asked the bartender to refresh it with some extra ice. No fresh cracked pepper in it, so the hubs dressed it up with extra dashes from the pepper shaker. The chicken wing stood out, but the rest of the appetizers were not especially memorable. . . Waffle fries were as delicious as I expected. When we asked for mayo, our helpful bartender offered two options, standard or black truffle mayo. The latter was very tasty. It went well on the little pub slider that came with the All About Mary. . . Pricey but an enjoyable experience. If you appreciate clean marble countertops and alternative rock bands like Muse, this might be your kind of place. Maybe you'll witness someone try and succeed at the 7 second challenge. Cheers!
Tuesday Bites & Flights are amazing! GREAT beer and GREAT food selections and pairings.
This is a safe bet for food and drink in the Aria area. I've been here several times at different times of day and prefer their lunch the most. There are just too many places to drink and eat dinner to recommend this place after happy hour. I like the decor and the staff is pretty good-- I will say that with loads of hard surfaces (tile everywhere), it does get very loud even at only half capacity. There is also a large bell that rings frequently, so if you aren't into that, go elsewhere. . . Drinks are plentiful any time of day. I've only had the beer and was pleasantly surprised by the selection. Their Bloody Mary bar looks sort of overwrought, but it doesn't necessarily look bad. It might be sort of fun if you are into vegetable juice cocktails (I am not). . . The fish and chips are good, and traditional in style. That means you should be dousing them in malt vinegar and saving the ketchup for your fries. Please do not be the jerk I saw one time dipping his fish in ketchup and complaining that they we're not like fish sticks-- it's embarrassing. Keep in mind that portion sizes are large here, so it may be a good idea to split these or any dish with a friend. . . I went into my last visit here expecting to write a four star review, but have to revise it downward. Yesterday for lunch I had the the CBLT which was not spectacular. It was sort of soggy and strange, although I appreciated the heft of it. I'll return to the fish and chips next time. Also-- avoid the waffle fries. They are not good and you will only be sad if you order them. I jump at any chance to eat waffle fries but was sorely disappointed with the bland, shapeless potato chunks that were delivered.
We came to watch a soccer game and asked if they're going to show it and the hostess told us they will.. We found out theyre not showing it after we sat on the bar and asked the bartenders if they can switch the channel after we waited for 15 minutes with nothing happening. Eventually we decided to leave.. Also there was a bartender who was very rude to us while we sat there, didn't pay attention to us and waved us with a laughing smile when we left.
Based on some of the reviews I don't know what exactly I was expecting however I was very pleasantly surprised. Although it is a little hard to find right outside of aria and in the crystals shopping center, The restaurant itself is actually very well decorated and has a cool hip vibe.    Really extensive beer list and decent prices on pitchers.  Expect upscale pub food and really think about getting something from the Carvary.     I got the openface pastrami which was to die for pair it with the mustard trio and the curry butter and you will be very very happy.
My husband was so excited to try this place out.  And it was good starting out - greeted by cute, friendly hostesses, fun decor/ambience, and then the food arrives. . . My husband got the lobster roll - said the bread to lobster ratio was way off.  My son got the chili - I know it's on the appetizer list, but it's $10 and the portion was laughably small.  My son's 5, and he was frustrated at how little he got.  My daughter got the duck buns - I should've known better than to order duck buns at a pub, my fault.  Not good at all.  Finally, I got the mussels.  Small, sandy, and there were at least 3 that just did not taste right... so much so that I actually warned my husband that if I were to get food poisoning later that night, the mussels would be to blame.  Ugh.... . So when we had finally trudged through our bad food (guess the small portions weren't such a bad thing after all), and then we got a huge bill at the end that just seemed way overpriced for the quality of the food we got, it just added insult to injury.  We really regretted wasting a perfectly good meal opportunity there, and won't ever go back again.
Very friendly staff everyone was super nov and took are of our every need , very welcoming and made us feel good . Our server Lindsey was amazing and made sure we were well taken care of , the sliders were good , and the Bloody Mary was also good. They make their own mix only thing I didn't like was the bathroom attendant she was very nice but I always feel weird w bathroom attendants I feel I have to pay them and I didn't have cash on me.. Overall tho food experience oh and u get a free beer for checking in
Average Vegas food.  Not much to write about here.  . . They have some decent beers here, but the brunch here is quite lackluster.  They should just stick with their sandwiches, which are decent if you stick with pastrami and their roast beef.  . . The service here is also a bit depressed, and lacking in energy.  You can do better in Vegas.  Come here for a beer at best.
Average bar food done Vegas style.
