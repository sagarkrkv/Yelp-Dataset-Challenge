Let's be clear here - this is the nightclub by which to judge all other nightclubs.  Hakkasan is la creme de la creme, and if you like to party in Vegas, it's just an absolute must.. . For all the negative reviews here:. . 1. Yes there may be a long ass line - buy tickets in advance or get in contact with a promoter before you get there.  I have no sympathy for freeloaders who complain about waiting.. . 2.  It's crowded as F*CK - is this honestly a surprise to you?!  If you hate crowds go somewhere no one likes, or spring for the table and have your own roped off section.. . 3.  I'm sorry you don't like house music? OK your review is irrelevant to me - have fun at 1OAK.. . OK - on to the good stuff:. . Hakkasan is B.E.A.UTIFUL!  The lights are amazing and I really love the hanging logos.  The layout is perfection, especially if you have a table.  There's no bad place to be in the club.  Yes it gets crowded, but the dance floor is so much bigger than places like Marquee or XS which is awesome.  . . If you want to see the worlds' top DJ's while you're in Vegas, Hakkasan is the place to do it.  Seriously, follow Tiesto on Snapchat - he loves Hakkasan!  I think it's also Aoki's favorite place to cake his fans.  Hakkasan is like a personal playground to these guys.  My goal is to see Above & Beyond there before the year's end.. . OK time to go book my next flight to Vegas...see you soon Dave N!
So f'n ridiculous. Spent a lot of money for two tickets to see Tiesto. This place is a fire hazard. No seating unless you buy bottle service. the downfall of that is there is NO SEATING anywhere else in the club. Since you cant sit you have to stand and since you have to stand they usher everyone to keep moving and not stand in one place. When I say it's literally shoulder to shoulder traffic jams of humans... the stairwells are clogged, the bars are usually 15-30 people deep waiting on slow ass bartenders... you'd think because it's vegas that they would be busy bartenders but they are slow as f@ck. You cant get to the dance floor because of human traffic jams, if you make it to the dancfloor it is just a mosh pit of people squeezed together so tight that your privates are touching each other and if one person moves then the entire crowd moves in waves. There were fist fights, drinks being thrown, If you buy a VIP table  they put the guys tables in the back of the club and you miss out, it's a complete sausagefest. They put skanks with bad hair extensions and fake boobs up front, complete white trash hoes.. . This place is a shit hole and I was going to reverse the charges on my credit card.. I rock out with the best in some of the best clubs in the world (Berlin, Paris, Los Angeles, New York) this is worst ran club with the worst crowd control and the worst layout and the worst people working there possible
Hakasan is racist as sad as it sounds tHEY  only want Americans that pay money and don't give a shit about the mistakes to take advantage of them! Guys be aware don't let that happen to you! If they take advantage of Russian imagine what they can DO TO  you!  I wrote to corporate and I called the cops nothing happened. Just be aware  Hakassan is full of shit and it doesnt matter for anything else in this world! They just plainly rip you off the money you pay for! . Always remember, Hakasan is owned by Armenian owner and if they don't let you in that means Armenians are rasist. Don't fight it just let these fucking pieces of shits do what they want because that's the only thing  these pices of shits deserve!! Cause they set low life and the Max they can do is rip peope off!!!  I can give it 0 stars! The bouncers at the front are racist to the point where you come with YOUR boyfriend AND you can't get in. And not only that if you're Russian or Armenian they fuck with you. They don't  give a fuck want you did to get in so no matter what, that's the life at Hakasan which  is racist as sad as it sounds! Up to you! I hope they lose business.  and that's not because I hate them but because they don't deserve what they pay for!!!!!! They  are full of shit which is not worth your money !!!!
Really enjoy the club, the DJ's are some of the best in the world. THey play what i want to hear. The only bad thing is that it is just so darn crowded. The prices for the drinks are where all night clubs are. The "well" drinks are made with pretty decent alcohol, so no need to get the fancy liquor.
This club layout sucks ass but Calvin Harris was awesome.  All the newer clubs have an open concept.  If you are claustrophobic or afraid of stairs I would avoid this place.
OLD ASS LOOKING CLUB PLUS RUDE ASS PEOPLE.! . . That should alrdy sum up my experience here. . . First, the taxi dropped my gfs and I at the front entrance of MGM hotel. Which felt like it took us forever, walking to the damn club. It was like a freaking maze... A mouse finding it's way to the cheese.. . One of my gf accidentally bumped into these guys, they looked at her and said "watch where ure going b"*%*". RUDE!. . To sum up how pathetic this club was, first floor looks like a cage. Seems like everyone has to go in this cage to dance. Not my thing. Second floor was the worst! Someone spilled beer all over my back and Chanel bag. RUDE.. . Will I ever go here again, just for TIESTO? . F%^* NO! I'll wait to see Tiesto at FREAKNIGHT in Seattle. Thank you very much!
First let's talk about rude! Most of the bouncers were rude. We went to see Calvin Harris the 26th of July. The guys in our group bought tickets we got on a guest list. We showed up at 8:45 and we were in line until 12 that's when the guys got fed up and went to get us. The birthday boy then proceeded to explain to the main security guy what happened who our promoter was ect ect. He wasn't having it. Finally he said if you pay for the girls they get in. Of course we all agreed went to the window to pay but we were already confirmed on the guest list and had the little paper and that got us in for free. . . In the club it was overcrowded. A guy next to our group went after one of our guys and ended up punching me instead. Security never showed up, but they did show up to hassle one of our guys about a cigar but the people next to us smoking weed received no such treatment. Finally! The group next to us left only to be replaced by a couple with no self respect! Kept putting their faces in each other's crotch. (Once again security no where to be found) . . Ultimately Calvin Harris was amazing! The beginning of the night though sucked!
This review is entirely based on my experience BEFORE even seeing the inside of the club.  Basically, super early into the evening, we found a promotor that put us on the VIP list to get in, (It was my best friends Bachelorette party) and he said that if we get in line by 9:30. we should be in by 10:15, because they open their doors at 10:00.  We got into line at 9!  And we were not that far back into the already pretty hefty line. 10PM  around and they are literally letting in about 2 people at a time, the line would move maybe a group of 5 every 20 or so minutes.  Basically we thought we were now at the front of the line, at 11PM, but turns out we were in line for ANOTHER line.  So just to get in the club we would have been waiting until close to midnight to get in, and WE WERE IN THE FRONT.  Overtime we left the line, called bull shit on the bouncers and hung out at other places, coming back two hours later only to see that the line was completely stretched across the entire casino.  Still barely moving.  I call complete bull shit.  I refuse to go into this club at this point ever unless someone personally walks me to the entrance doors.  WASTE OF THREE HOURS IN VEGAS!. We actually ended up going to BEACHER'S MADHOUSE and only waited in line for about 10 minutes before we got it, and damnit, that club was so gawd damn fun, best club I think I've been to thus far, and the people running it were actually decent, non money hungry people. :)
Oh man lines are way too long and customer service is terrible.  They moved us around three different lines (even though we were on VIP guestlist) and took us three hours to get in. Dj line up is the best, but not worth the hassle.
Went to see Tiesto on August 7th-8th.. . 1.) Long lines.. 2.) Oversold tickets. Like 500 at least.. 3.) Totally disorganized.. 4.) $80 ($30 for women, $50 for men). . Breaking some fire code regulations for sure.. . Reversing charges on our credit card as we waited for over 3 hours and didn't even get in!!!. . SHEESH! I feel bad for bringing my girlfriend to such a crappy event!! I'm usually really good at picking these things out too.
Decent night club! Love the crowd here. Music, Bass, lightings are really good.
SO glad my boyfriend and I went to Hakkasan..definitely an experience we will never forget! . TIP: find a promoter and get on the guest list! We used Chris Hornak..which was amazing! . It will be VERY crowded. Even if you are on the guest list and you get there around 11 you will be in line for over 30 minutes. . . Hakkasan is the hottest club right now strictly because of their amazing DJs (Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Steve Aoki) and the DJs don't come on stage until around 1am usually. . With that being said, its all EDM so don't be surprised if you aren't hearing the Top 40. . . As the night goes on it gets more and more crowded so you will be body to body with everyone but the energy is contagious!
By far the best part is the DJs they bring in here. All the best ones. After that, not much to talk about. Does take a while to get in and and seems more a scene than everyone being there for the music. The dance floor packs with the first DJ and never clears. If you cant get on the floor or into VIP you won't see much as everyone in VIP stands on the walls and prevents everyone else from seeing the show. Drink prices are ridiculous too. The staff is all over the place though keeping the place clean throughout the night and preventing fights.
alot older adults here clubbin like theyre in the late 20s...all actin' a fool here, but its vegas...its whatever here.  music is okay, and vibe is alright.
Awesome night club.  Will most likely Cindee back again next Vegas trip. Bar service was quick good music.  Glad they had two floors for hip-hop and Edm. Tiesto was playing when I went so tickets were 100$. Only thing that threw me off was someone taking a piss in the corner of the club.
1.) Unorganized. 2.) Workers are rude and unprofessional. 3.) TOO crowded. . When I first arrived, the whole thing was totally unorganized! There were so many "guest list tickets" given out which made the event overly crowded. The guy who checked my ID also didn't believe the photo was me and had to ask someone else. When the OTHER guy approved immediately, I turned around and saw he did it to several other girls as well... C'mon, are you trying to check them out or give them a hard time on purpose? POOR work ethic dude. Either that or he's just really bad at his job. . . After getting into the venue, I admit it's pretty big due to the different floors (one star to that), but you won't fully enjoy it if you can't even access to the dance floor because of how crowded it is. Unless you have bottle service, think twice about coming here!
Word on the street was that Hakkasan was the place to be so we had to check it out while on our mini vaca. Honestly it was overrated. The top floor was techno with a lot of VIP booths. The booths were fun but im not a techno person so we went to check out the hip hop area which was super packed, no where to dance. The music was a lot better and thats where our night started, closes super late.
Finally got the chance to go to Hakkasan a couple months ago and have nothing but amazing things to say about my experience!  The line outside seemed organized to me, just a lot of upset people if they didn't get there way in VIP/Bottle Service trying to sneak in or bribe. We got right in, easy security and then got table service on the 5th floor. I wanted main stage, but after seeing our spot it actually was a great location and great view. . . I'll definitely be returning and thank you Hakkasan staff for making my night a great one!!
.... Meh, not worth it. Layout sucks really unorganized in terms of general flow of people about the club. Overpriced.
Got bottle service to see Tiesto on Friday 8-1-2014 and had absolutely a great time! Thank god for having a table because we have room to move around :-)
Mainstream/overrated. Waited 2 1/2 hours just to get into tiesto. . Go to the neighboring clubs forsure. If you are a women trying to wear heels, don't bother because you will take them off in desperation of pain waiting in line.Won't recommend this club If you are trying to party ASAP
Poorly run business. Especially for Vegas. I've waiting in line when XS was hot and the "it club" for an hour on Labor Day weekend on a Saturday with a bunch of girls and this line is stupidly run with an idiot for a "manager and business owner" get your shit together. Really. GET YOUR SHIT TO-GET-HER.
These other reviews are crazy... Do people realize this is a nightclub? I am not the clubbing type but I still found this club to be a lot of fun! Went to tiesto and he was amazing!! Of course the drinks are crazy expensive and a bottle of water is 9 yikes! I didn't find this place to be overcrowded... Dance floor is a little small and it gets jammed packed but then again it's a nightclub... We went to the front but it was too crazy and the gf kept getting drinks spilled and toes stepped out so we went to the outskirts. Outskirts were not bad at all which was nice. Enjoyed the show after that. If u wanna go pay the money ($50) before hand and take the stress out of dealing with the bouncers. Doors opened at 1030 we got in at 10... No stress and it was great! Highly recommend seeing the top djs in the world!
I love this club, best club in Vegas by far! We got a table for my friend's birthday party.  The waitresses came out with the bottles, lights, happy birthday sign, and confetti. Very cool presentation! The waitresses at our table were really attentive, nice, and hott! The bathroom line wasn't that bad and the bathroom attendants were so nice and helpful. We partied all night long and the DJ was awesome! The venue was so pretty and huge! The only complaint I have is that it's very cold when you first walk in.  I recommend getting a table if you go.
For being one of the "main" clubs in Vegas, I was severely disappointed. I would give a no star review if it was possible... Our group was in contact with a promoter about getting our group in Thursday night to see Tiesto, who upon arrival bailed on getting us in; red flag #1 - poor promoters. Next we were stuck in some back entrance to the casino from the taxi stand. If you hate crowded and confined spaces with little AC, you would've died; red flag #2 - not enough space. The "icing on the cake" was when they decided to move the line OUTSIDE into the back alley of the MGM where they tow dumpsters and where an ambulance was there to probably pick up someone who OD'd; red flag #3 - red flag for the back alley, not the ambulance. We ended up not going in after waiting for two and a half hours, including the hour in the heat with another 2 hours to go in the line. I MIGHT give Hakkasan one more shot, but they're off to one shoddy start...
It started out as a very long wait. But organized, single file. I hate when u have to wait 1.5 hrs and its from people cutting in line. So I was happy to see they were watching the line closely and guiding everyone. Getting on a guestlist meant no cover which we loved. Once inside we were sooo amazed. 5 floors, 2 different styles of music playing, huge dance floor, not impossible to get drinks. Even though they are hella expensive drinks! I'll deff be back.
Went sat. Night to see Tiesto security was very rude.  I was asking to make sure I was in the right spot for will call and was given attitude even though the signs said I was in the right spot I wasn't so not my fault mr. Rude security man.  The club was filled with what seemed like artificial smoke which made it hard to breath.  No place to sit at all unless you bought a private booth dumb idea. Left within one hour as it was severely over crowded.  Dress code was not enforced at all lots of tennis shoes and flip flops and t shirts overall terrible experience.  Would not recommend this club to anyone.
What a night at Hakkasan Bachelor, Bachelorette, and dirty 30 BDay all in one.We got one of the best table service so far here at Hakkasan. They really improved on that.  I mean that our drinks was never empty. Our server Megan did an amazing job of filling everybody drinks, and always refilling our drink mixes also mixing drinks. This was one of the craziest night ever. Tiesto threw down an amazing set over 2 hours. Everybody in our party had a really great time, and that's all I can remember.
Ew, not a fan of Hakkasan. It's way too tiny to be SO popular! The dance floor is so small, and there are so many people. There's no outdoor area to chill so you're stuck in their small dark interior the entire time. Poorly designed because there's no way to know which way to go or which staircasesto take. Very hard for drunkies to navigate since there are no signs and the staircases to diff floors are all spread out. It's like a dark maze!!! . . Drinks are ridiculously overpriced, at least $20 for an alcoholic drink and they are soo watered down. An AMF tasted like punch. They don't offer tap water or water fountains. If you're thirsty, you have to pay $10 for a TINY fiji bottle. Drain us of all our money, why don't ya?!. . If you try to stay downstairs at the main dance floor, you will definitely be rubbing up on all the strangers around you. We could barely move there, so we spent half of our time walking around and going up and down all these staircases trying to find a good spot. We had to opt to dancing behind the tables by the bar until we decided that we would have a better time partying in our hotel suite. The ONLY time to go to Hakkasan is if you can afford a table!
I really enjoy the MGM Grand Casino and think Hakkasan is a great attribute, but I was very disappointed when the club staff said that hotel guests had to pay to enter the club.. . I think that being a hotel guest should allow free admission into the MGM Grand Hakkasan night club.. . I am a gold member and was appalled when my friends and I had to pay to get into the club.. . Since then I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and have been politely greeted and given free entry into club Marquee.
-If you are trying to get in free as a dude, you're out of your mind.. -If you're trying to get in free as a chick, be prepared to get in line at 9, wait till club opens at 10, stand in line until 12, then maybe get in for free or pay some cover.. -Being on guest list means you have your name on a piece of paper....and that's it.. . Best way to get into the club without the line and the grief is to just suck it up and buy the pre-sale tickets. Then you get to stand in the shorter line and you can get into the club in about 10 minutes.. . To have the best time:. . Get a fucking table AHEAD of time. There is literally nowhere to sit for anyone WITHOUT a table. . . It's going to be crowded.. You're going to get lost.. Drinks are for sure going to cost 20 bucks for a watered down shot.. This is what you WANT when you try to come here. If you're complaining about this, then you need to switch up your expectations. You didn't have the time of your life here because you wanted it to be something it's not.
Super crowded, no outdoor area, admission is very pricey, long lines if not VIP, and just overall nuts. . .  if you don't have some sort of VIP access and if there is a big DJ then forget about getting in! Luckily I was apart of a group package for the weekend and then Tiesto decided to come so it worked out great but he didn't come on until like 2:30am. Which, I get it, it's Vegas and the main DJ's come on later, but we were told at the latest 1:30am.. Sunnery James wouldn't shut the heck up! . . Another huge annoyance.. the packed dance floor. There is no room even when it's not busy. UGh.
This club blows, after getting on some "guest list" of a "promoter" named Luis Moo; we stood in line for ever. And this was with having 3 girls no guys. Even tho we were suppose to get in for free we ended up not even being able to get in because the line literally was a 10 minute walk through the casino and outside to some sketchy alleyway. . . Felt super bad recommending this to my sister for her birthday. Especially this being a first time clubbing visit to vegas. . . If you value your time and want to spend it actually going clubbing don't bother setting up a VIP list. It's not a guest list, it's Not VIP it's longer than the regular list.
Table service, guest list, or not, it doesn't matter. Lines are too long, promoters are disorganized and even fight in front of guests. Even if you pay for a table, they won't let you in if there's "not enough girls". I'm a local so I know how it goes here and this is by far the worst club experience yet.
0 stars. Awful service from unprofessional staff. They were unaware of a private invite only event for which more than 200 people lined up with tickets. They did not keep the event private.  The door staff and bartenders were consistently rude.  Door staff seemed to be only concerned with collecting $200 handshakes from men and $100 handshakes from women to let people skip the line.  This place gets my strongest UNrecommend
We had just experienced Tryst the night before and my friend and I were excited about trying this club that was featuring Tiesto.  I admit I didnot know who Tiesto was, not being of the club scene, but I was told he was quite famous.  So we ordered our tickets on-line to pay the discounted $50 cover. Yes. That's discounted.  It would also allow us to get to the front of the line.. . So we get there around 11:00 p.m. and trying to find the Will-Call line took us and a few other couples a few minutes to find.  Clearly marked signs would have helped.  We come upon this young lady carrying a clipboard, who apparently was hating life, if I judged her facial expression correctly.  Cold and bitter cannot even begin to describe her look. She asks for our names and we give her my friends name who bought the ticket. . . Her:  "There's only one name on this purchase.". Us:  "Yes, but there are 2 tickets purchased". Her:  "But only one name". Us:  "When we bought the tickets it didn't allow us to enter the guests names". Her:  "Let me look at your email confirmation". Us:  "Here" - we show her the screen on our phone. Her:  Flips through the pages on her clipboard. Her:  Looks at us - as if she'll see our names printed on our forehead I guess. Her:  "Fine.  Just go.". . The warmth of her words made me feel sooooo giddy. . . And that wasn't the only bad encounter we had with Hakkasan staff.  The elevator attendants, and those silly guys walking around with the flashlights.  You're all rude. One of those guys actually pushed me to the side when I didn't move fast enough out of his way.  With the exception of the African American security guy on the 1st floor, and the African American elevator attendant (1st elevator).  Those two smiled and joked with us.  The others literally were rude and condescending.  . . If that wasn't bad, it was apparent this place was seriously over packed. You could not walk without getting pushed and shoved and stepped on.  I felt like a little puppy in the middle of the pacific ocean!  We got to the 5th floor where it was less crowded.  . . I will say that Tiesto was good...as much as I can say about DJ's.  Honestly, though.  I don't know how anyone can enjoy themselves unless they purchase those extremely expensive bottle service.  No chairs.  No view because the VIP sections take up all the balcony...the lights were interesting to watch though.. . Coming back?  No. Way.. . Note to Hakkasan Management:  We were there August 9th.  You may wish to discuss with that young lady, her lack of professionalism and non-existent customer service skills.
Okay, so let's say you're making a sandwich in your kitchen and once you're finished you take the sandwich upstairs to your room to eat. Then you take a bite out of your sandwich and realize you forgot mayonnaise on it. Now, that look of disappointment painted on your face? That pretty much sums up Hakkasan.. . Their dance floor is always more overcrowded than any other club and it's impossible to not spill a drink when on the floor. If you have a table, that's a completely different experience. But even then, it wasn't that special. Not for me, anyway. . . No reason to complain about the high prices on drinks, but that's pretty standard on the strip. And I know the clubs are always going to be packed, but at Hakkasan, I feel as though it's more packed than anywhere else I've been compared to the rest of the strip. . . The resident DJ lineup and the DJs that do play put on great shows. Dada Life, Above and Beyond, Steve Aoki and the rest of them put on great shows. But this review has nothing to do with the entertainment, but the club itself.. . Overall, I'd probably go again, but if I had an option to go anywhere else, I'd probably go there.
TIESTO IS SIIIIICKKK. By far the best DJ in the world. Went to hakkasan for the first time , and tiesto was playing. Not much of a club-goer myself, but if you are one I would highly recommend you experience hakkasan when tiesto is playing. Something about his music that makes ppl go crazy. Will definitely return.
On Friday night two of my girlfriends were on the dance floor when it was crowded and they had their purse on their arms and they got their cell phones stolen right out from under them. They did not leave it on a counter or anything. Always was on their arm. I heard many clubs in Vegas been having this happen, then even in the elevator another girl I over heard said she lost her phone also at this club! SO BEWARE the club itself is fun, but you need to know there are serious con artist taking your cell phones, the hotels and clubs should have signs to inform their customers and to have people be more aware and to not have this be so rapid.
All the reviews on the power tripping rude staff and the no sitting policy and $9 small bottle drinks are all true... . . Not really complaining about water. They can charge whatever they want, BUT the rude staff and no sitting are for non table/VIP guest is ridiculous.. . Also. Stairs.. Stairs.. stairs.. stairs... everywhere. I saw like at least 3 people fall due to the stairs. . . Basically If you want to sit, YOU WILL NEED TABLE. if you dont have a table and you sit. someone will come and make you get up.
I honestly get annoyed when I hear people comparing Hakkasan to other clubs such as XS. They're two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT concepts. Get that straight.. . I love Hakkasan. They truly redefine the new meaning of luxury. Every execution of this club was well thought of from the design, to the dresses the cocktail servers wear, to the DJs they end up signing as their residents.. . You do taste nothing short of chic and glamour once you step in. Yeah, it's dark with a lot of stairs but there are also elevators if you're not impatient to wait for it.. . And yes. It can be packed. Sardine style. But what club isn't when you have people like Calvin Harris or Hardwell spinning all night? Quit complaining since there are people that weren't fortunate to even get in.. . I'm still a firm believer that it's not the place, but the people that makes it fun. And if you had a horrible experience, reconsider going with different people that are willing to have a good time regardless of what the situation might be.
I beg to differ with the negative reviews, Here's my two cents: . . Music: There is no doubt in my mind that Hakkasan has the best residents DJ's in the game right now: Calvin Harris, Hardwell, and Steve Aoki are just some of the many that play there. I came here two weeks ago for Bingo Players and was definitely a happy camper. Although he is not as well known as the others, he played a really good set! However, I also want to commend Eva Shaw for her set as well. She was the DJ prior to Bingo Players and she was so good that I confused her work for Bingo Players at one point. Overall, I was really happy about the music aspect.   . . Venue: The dance floor is pretty cramped and like others have said it does feel like you are packed like sardines. But if you stand towards the back where the tables are then there should be more room to dance.. . Wait time/ Guest list: My promoter in particular was very accommodating and got us into the club with no problem! As my promoter recommended, I arrived with my group at 10pm or so and the line was actually moving at a steady pace. I think we were able to get in within the first 30 minutes of the club opening.. (*** Guest list line is near Rainforest Cafe***). . Bouncers/ Security: Let me warn you in advance, security will NOT HESITATE to throw you out or kick you out of line if you are too drunk! Enough said.  However, I do appreciate the fact that they do cut you some slack to let you re-enter the line/ club after a specified time. For my group in particular, we had to sit outside for an hour before we were allowed to re-enter the line.. . Although I know that this club has a lot of mixed reviews, I still think it's worth giving it a go before throwing in the towel!
Best club ever!! I went there on a Saturday night and Tiesto was playing!!! The club was pack!! full of beautiful fun and  people!! The people who work there treat you like if you were part of the Saudi Royal family, they are all about you and they do anything to make you experience Las Vegas night life to its  fullest, I want to thank my host Diego Diaz who got all of my buddies in and got us a super table!! you should text him if you are coming to Vegas(702) 540-8923
Horrible promoters. All lies and scams. They honestly ruined my entire Vegas experience. Don't ever fall for them. 0 stars to be honest. If you're that desperate to get into this basic club just pay and skip the line.
A promoter tried to get us on the guest list .. We waited 4 hours and still didn't get in. Then a promoter tried to say that I said fuck you to him when he mis understood my words and then kicked me out if line. Completely unprofessionally as terrible customer service
I knew what we were in for after reading the reviews, but it was still exhausting. Labor Day weekend, three hours waiting with hundreds of people even though we came early, tired when you finally make it inside, super crowded, way smaller than I expected and annoying little pathways due to tables everywhere. I wanted my friend to see at least one club and the staff was not horrible as described in other reviews. Overall I did not see at all why this is worth standing even in a ten minute line. In Europe every second club looks like this and is bigger. Some people seemed to enjoy it and if you have a funny group that makes three hours fly by for you - do it, I'll go for sth else next time.
