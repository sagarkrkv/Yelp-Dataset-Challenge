I hate to say that I was disappointed this time. :( One of the things I LOVED most about this room was the Japanese soaking tub. We stay at The cosmo for the furniture market = a TON of walking. I was exhausted and looked forward to my bath all day. ....to my disappointment the bath plug was TOTALLY busted & tossed to the side of the tub. SO obvious that it was broken! . . Oh also the pool was "CLOSED" because it was raining a little bit. . . Other than that, it was amazing of course. beds are like clouds. Having a deck in Vegas is just amazing!
I can never complain about this place. Top notch service, great amenities and fantastic rooms. Probably the best on the strip here in Vegas. I usually stay in the terrace or wraparound suites, they are about as good as they come. . Get a shake at Holsteins, you will not regret it!!
My friend referred to this hotel as the hotel where all the young, beautiful people are. There are a lot of pretty people here. During the day, there's bikini clad chicks going to the pool. At night, there's a lot of scantly clad ladies going to the club. During my last trip to Vegas, I stayed here and at Harrah's for a work convention. There is a big difference between here and Harrah's. Cosmo is not somewhere that I would stay if I was coming to Vegas with kids. Vegas is not "family friendly" in general, but I wouldn't stay here if I was coming here with family/young kids. The room was nice and clean, but it's awkward if you're sharing with someone who is not your significant other. Get a room here if you want a room that sets a sexy ambiance. When you sit in the bedroom, you can see what's going on in the shower/bathroom if you don't pull down the blinds on the shower. One of the shower walls is a clear window. Even when you pull the blinds down on the clear shower wall, you can see the outline of the person in the shower. There's so many mirrors in the room, too. So it's good if you're booking a room with your partner. It's not so good if you're booking with friends. It's nice, but I rather stay somewhere without the clear shower wall if I'm go to Vegas with friends.
Found a giant pubic hair in the bathtub. Yuck!. . We were excited about using the tub, but low and behold, we found a big nasty hair in the tub. YUCK!. . This is Marriott property and I'm Platinum Premeir. I would have hoped they would have treated me better. . . I guess Marriott's loyalty program doesn't apply in Vegas
My colleagues and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan Hotel for a conference and had mainly good experiences. While the hotel is large, and navigation could sometimes be difficult, we all got where we were supposed to be when we were supposed to be there.. . I handled booking for our team and had positive interactions with staff pre-conference. They were helpful, friendly, and efficient in helping me book about 20 rooms and make sure all the credit card charges were in order. . . We did have two incidents. One staff member found her room hadn't been cleaned when she checked in, but the hotel promptly cleaned it and were very apologetic. Another staff member had an unpleasant encounter with a rude attendant at Marquee; the hotel apparently runs the nightclub through a third-party service provider, so they couldn't help much with that.. . I personally had a great experience -- the room was huge, the balcony had a fun view of the Bellagio pool, and service was prompt and friendly. Also, when I injured myself off-property, the front-desk staffer I spoke to (hi Bryce!) went out of his way to help me out, finding me a clinic and getting me into a cab to get there. The next day he called to check up on me, too. . . We ate in the hotel several times -- at Wicked Spoon, China Poblano, and Holstein. Wicked Spoon's buffet was awesome and Holstein had great burgers; China Poblano had good food but super-creepy decor. The buffets at the conference, catered by the hotel, were tasty too. . . Overall, the experience at the Cosmopolitan was pretty awesome. Thanks for hosting us this year!
This hotel is a must for the young and young-at-heart crowd visiting Vegas. It is one of the newer hotels and offers modern decor with a classic Vegas flair.  It is a prime location on the strip and has excellent service. We were offered a room upgrade when we checked in, but the basic rooms are spacious and luxurious.. . The Chandelier bar is a must-stop. It is a multi-tier bar that is set inside of a giant chandelier in the middle of the casino. Perfect for people watching and a drink to start or end the night.. . The restaurants on the mezzanine level are incredible. One of my favorite chefs, Scott Conant, has one of his Scarpetta restaurants here. The food is over the top amazing and the view of the strip is a must see. Try to reserve a table near one of the windows.. . The spa is very relaxing and was a perfect way to relax after a few nights on the town. I highly recommend getting addons to your massage. The body buffer increases circulation to your body and gets you ready for another night of dancing!. . Marquee, the day/night club, is one of the hottest spots in Vegas. On any given night, there is a top DJ/producer at this club. For example, Armin van Buuren, Avicii, AND Kaskade played there during our stay. This is a must! Make reservations early because it sells out fast.. . Overall, I would 100% stay at this hotel again. I was so impressed by everything it had to offer.
We loved the room and would definitely stay here again. Everything was clean and modern and greatly exceeded my expectations. My only complaint is that the kitchenette doesn't actually have a fridge, as it is all reserved for mini-bar type items, and to rent a stand alone is $25. The only open space is in the freezer. . . We spent most of our time at the Bamboo pool. I found a nice shaded spot with a cool mist raining down on us most of the day, which was pretty amazing given the temperature. The water temperature was actually cool enough to make the pool a really nice escape from the heat and the lounge seats in the shallow water are fabulous. . . We don't gamble and were really there to just chill out and get a break from the kids, try some new restaurants, and see a few shows. We arrived very early Tuesday morning and will make a point of arriving early in the week on our next visit as well. Clearly things were going to get crazy for the weekend with all the cool young people, so the Friday departure was perfect for us.
First time staying here. Love the rooms. Very roomy and comfortable! Big enough you don't really need to upgrade! I like this casino because it is quieter. You don't have to walk through the masses every time you get somewhere. Service has been really great.. But the smell in the casino is strange! It smells like a combination of bad perfume and smoke! It is quite gross actually. You get used to it until you walk out and come back again.. . They have a shuttle from 11-8pm daily that takes you to the Cesar Shops!. Would stay here again.
Hands down the best place you can stay at. I will say it's even a must. Sure there might be fancier places. But you can't feed off the energy this place turns out unlike the other hotels here.
Rooms are nice and spacey. Great pool area and service close to most locations by foot. The check in took very long but we were there on the fourth of July.
Considering that Hooters is my favorite casino in the world, you must take this review with a grain of salt.  However, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas may very well be the coolest casino on earth. Why?  From the minute we stumbled up to the front desk, the service was outstanding!  Two thumbs WAY up to Amir, Kevin, Emir Lopez for the great room with the balcony/terrace upgrade. I never want to leave.
My check-in was quick.  More than I can say for other properties on the Strip!  And once I checked in the elevators were right behind, so no walking through the casino to get to where I needed to be.  Like that !. . The room?  Nice size.  Good bathroom, well appointed.  The desk space was roomy too and the overall feel was just fine.. . However, City Center is tough to get in and out of.  Best to walk to wherever you want to go or a quick taxi.  I parked my car and only went back for it the day I left.  Of course, had plans to scoot around, but it is a pain getting in an around the Strip these days.. . I had room service and went to some of the restaurants.  The Henry for breakfast was god with good coffee and friendly wait service.. . One afternoon I happened upon the tapas restaurant on the fourth level.  Lots of chorizo choices and, I'm told, the bar right there was voted best gin & tonics in LV!. . Cosmopolitan is a great property and one that will not disappoint.
OMG, I love this hotel. So much that I think I spent three back-to-back days at the casino, bars and of course, Rose. Rabbit. Lie - the highlight of our Vegas girls trip.. . As "posh" as many other hotels try to brand their crowds, they do attract more of the Golden Corral types. But The Cosmopolitan was filled with so much eye candy, which I fully enjoyed. Because, when I dress to the nines, I wanna be around other people doing the same - not people in their jammie pants and flip flops. Sorry, I digress.. . If you're looking for a young, modern twist on Vegas Swank, then check out The Cosmopolitan. And take me with you because I still have some vouchers that I forgot to cash.
The first time I stayed at this hotel about a year ago I fell in love.  This time I wish I had tried another place.  Our room wasn't ready when promised, when we finally got to our room, our keys didn't.  That took another 25 minutes to fix.  Then we headed to the Bamboo pool which is supposed to be a peaceful retreat and it was just like any other party pool in Vegas with murky pool water and loud music.  The next day, it was more of the same with no on staff stopping outside boombox from playing.  The rooms and the views are magnificent. The food at the Grill and Sushi restaurant were amazing.  This housekeeping staff were the nicest of all the staff.   This place looks like it should be 5 star but theservice at the front desk and pool area are more like a two star.  The only reason I give it a 3 star is because they have great restaurants and their housekeeping staff keeps their rooms so clean and they are so helpful.
Not really sure what the hype is about with this hotel. Came here attending the acics conference, and boy was the customer service horrible. I have stayed at the rio, aria, mirage, and Venetian; the employees here seem like they're here just to finish their 8 hours and hate their jobs. I booked my room with their conference rate, thus all along everyone working the front desk should have known that I was with the conference upon checking in. Without knowing, I ended up paying for my first day's Internet, I called room service regarding a problem with my Internet the second day, then they informed me that people that are with the conference should not have to pay for wifi. . . The wifi issue went on for all 6 nights; having to call front desk to manually resert our wifi each night for it to work and connect to my devices.
I stayed a few nights here last week and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Great location, many shops and restaurants near by and the view from the hotel room balcony was fantastic. The only negative point I have is that the room service turned out to be incredibly expensive as they added numerous unnecessary charges on top of the actual amount for the food. If this had been stated anywhere before I ordered I wouldn't have had room service at all. Otherwise I highly recommend it.
Great place.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms are a great deal for the price.  Good restaurants.  Plenty of parking.  The video art in the elevators and on the lobby walls is really cool.   Highly recommended.
One of my favorite hotels in Vegas. It smells good, looks good, comfy. I had a great time at Marquee Dayclub, I got very tipsy drinking those blue daiquiris! LOVE THEM. We met nice ppl as well. Nice looking men and people that are young professionals, not too old or too young! My only con are the crazy elevator walks/rides when you have friends on an opposite floor than you. Our balcony views were awesome, spacious bathrooms and awesome decor, Ill be back
No hotel is perfect, but I've stayed at this hotel three different times and something always happened. I just got back from staying at the Cosmopolitan and I was disappointed with what went down. First night I checked-in to my room I noticed that my entire floor smelled like mildew. As soon as I got off the elevator I could smell something rancid. The manager offered to send someone up to the floor to spray it along with my room, but it did very little to help. The next morning I woke up, opened  the blinds to go outside onto the balcony, and at the base of the sliding door I see a bloody and used condom! A manager came up, we talked for a few minutes, and then they offered me a $150 credit to my account. There are a lot of good things about this hotel, but there have been issues with my room/stay all three times I've stayed there. I've never had issues with the Bellagio, MGM, Hard Rock, or Venetian.
Stayed here for a long weekend and my first time in Vegas and it was fabulous.  Our room was large enough to be someone's apartment and the view of the fountain/strip was absolutely amazing.  Ended up trying room service a few times and that didnt disappoint either. Gorgeous hotel!
I had 2 comp nights at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas and had to cash in on that deal.  I've always loved the look of this hotel and was so excited.. . My scheduled flight came into Vegas in the morning so we were just wanting to check in our bags and pray for an early check in.  What is is awesome about this hotel is that you can check in at anytime!  You'll get a inactive key and when your room is ready they can call or text you your room number and like magic your key works!  No room was available at the time, but they said they would try to get us one as soon as they can!  Both the front desk staff and the bell staff were so nice!. . To kill time we headed over to Wicked Spoon to get our breakfast feast on!  Look for my review on that eatery later, but some quick notes: Staff is good, but we had a coupon and I'm not sure I'd pay full price.  After out pig out session we were happy to hear my phone get a text to let us know our room was ready.  We told the bell staff we would take our bags up, but they offered to deliver it to us.  We were tired, so we accepted.  When we got to our rooms we were blown away!  We had ordered the King Bed standard room.  We had a small lounge area, desk, 2 TVs, a large tub and separate shower, microwave, bar sink and more.  I was a fan of this hotel instantly.  I've had comp rooms in other hotels, but I don't think I'll want to stay anywhere else! The bed was plush and inviting.  . . After a well deserved nap, we headed down to gamble a bit, this isn't the largest casino on the strip, but it has most things that you would want.  Their table prices are pretty standard for being on the strip.  I like to play the slots, and there are tons of those.  If you like a big sports book, this isn't were you'd want to go.. . We didn't get to use the fitness center nor the pools but took a quick look at them, and the fitness center is small.  The pools are pretty nice, nothing too big, this does not include the Day Club, as I didn't want to pay or had the time to go.  . . If you're hungry for some pizza late at night, there is Secret Pizza!  That place is so randomly fun.. . Overall, I loved my experience here.  Staff was friendly, and I loved my room.  They are a smaller hotel/casino in the grand scheme of things on the Vegas Strip, so you might miss out on some of the things associated with those kinds of hotels, but they are just a walk away if you want to visit.  I can't wait to stay here again!
Beautiful interior as far as the famous chandeliers go, I just wish they would've stuck with the theme and not have random pieces of art in the hallway that has no correlation with the main theme that the Cosmo is known for. Service at the front desk in my situation was annoying. The man who checked us in had 0 to little eye contact which I find rude, he was annoyed with our questions & was rushing us. I'm sure not every employee is like this, however this fellow was. The room we have is astandard 2 queen bedroom with nice balcony & beautiful restroom . The elevator makes me nauseous. But on the bright side, it's convenient to all of the stores we've been too and the spa as well. Easy access to the strip, right smack dab in the middle. This hotel has a lot of things to keep busy, so you really won't have to leave. Restaurants, ice cream, shops, gambling, spa, pool, etc ! There's so much to do ! & yes I would return :)
The Mixology bar is a must.
I loved it here. Everything inside is so modern and flashy. Enjoyed the balcony and the view. Room is clean and the bathroom was beautiful. Worth every penny.
I just returned home from a 4 day (2 comped day) stay, and am still dreaming of the wraparound suite my husband and I called home at the Cosmo. The room was palatial and luxurious, the restaurants were delicious, and the people watching was amazing. This place is great for the hip twenty-something crowd, but I really wouldn't recommend it for families, alcoholics, quiet people, or the elderly. It's a party place, and its awesome if that's what you are looking for. It's sort of like being temporarily transported into one of those prime time young adult soap operas on the CW, but in the best way. I dropped one star for the ash tray that passed for an elevator and the general wear and tear on the finishes throughout. As with all things Vegas, this place will age quick and hard. It's already begun to show it's first fine lines around the edges of furniture, stained walls, and threadbare sofas. Quick tip: skip the club at least once to wake up at 5 am and feel superior to the people who stayed up all night and are hobbling pathetically around in a sloppy mess of smeared eyeliner, rumpled suits, axe body spray, and ripped stockings.
The best hotel in Vegas. I recommended getting a balcony with a view of the fountains. The staff was SO NICE. The hotel was beautiful. My stay was perfect here. I'm coming back in February!
We just spent my sister's birthday there and I have to say it's as cushy and fantastic as they say. The suite was beautiful and the view was tremendous. . . Have to shout out three specific people that made the place even more awesome: . . 1. Sandy Jones - The "pit boss lady" of awesomeness. Craps is my favorite and she and the awesome people there at 5-9am made it a great time... and did what she could to clean up my language. . . 2. Charles W. at the Autograph Lounge - Everything I needed, he made happen. And he's personable and charming to boot. . . 3. Kae at the Cosmo pool - Very accommodating and friendly. That place turns baking in the desert into an art form. . . Overall, hope I can come back sooner rather than later and love the place! I even found out about that secret drink at the front bar. AMAZING.
Awesome hotel! Amazing room and views but the best part is the terrific customer service!!! Will be going here for years to come!!!!
I am updating and lowering the rating because after coming home and reviewing the credit card statement, the hotel overcharged us $500.00. In addition, one night a server at one of the restaurants gave herself an additional $70.00 tip (over the 20+ percent she was given, no less). Both issues were resolved to our satisfaction, however, a luxury hotel would not have these sort of issues. My time is important to me and I'd rather not have to call customer service and spend an hour on this. We have stayed here three times but will probably look elsewhere next visit. What a disappointing end to an otherwise nice time.
J'adore!! . . It was my first time staying in this hotel but it had been on my bucket list for awhile. I swooped into Vegas to help out with a Yelp event and this is the hotel my boss-lady picked. As I was checking in the help desk was amazing and upon hearing that it was my first trip at that property they put me in a room facing the Bellagio Fountains. Truly the best view I've ever had in Vegas!! I totally instagramed the fountain show a couple times and even...sigh... took a couple selfies. I know. But it was such a cool room! . . The hotel staff was always helpful and friendly, including the bell desk and valet. The taxi line moved quickly each time I used it and room service was SUPER friendly and delicious. . . My room had a massive bathroom plus a sitting room, wet bar, lounge on the patio and comfy bed. Plenty of light and loved the decor... as I'm writing this I'm realizing that they might just be my new favorite place to stay! . . It's also so convenient located-on the strip, right across from the Miracle Mile shops, and exit straight to a sky walkway to cross the street. . . While I didn't love every dining outlet on site, the pool is top notch and I spent a morning there working. It seems small but there more than one on site and the sprawl out around the area into multiple corners and crannies. . . 5 stars all the way!
I love this hotel... It would be 5 stars except the casino pays 6:5 on blackjack which is a big disappointment. For those that do not know, when you get blackjack you should be paid 1 1/2 times your wager, but Cosmo has tables that pay barely more than you wager... Over time you can lose much faster than with traditional blackjack rules.  Play blackjack at casinos that pay 3:2!!!!. . The rooms are awesome, the staff is great, the balconies are unique and great!!! This hotel rocks, just don't play blackjack on their 6:5 tables!!!
I stayed here in June 2013, and I know it took me a while to write this review, but I am completely confident this is the best hotel I have EVER stayed in.  The experience was magical.  I had a one bedroom suite overlooking the Bellagio Water Fountains, but truthfully, the fountain was fun for the first day, so I would also be okay with staying at the other side of the building next time.  . . I don't know what Vegas offers today, but when I visited, I noticed many things that set the Cosmopolitan apart!  Number one is ease of finding a parking space (TOP NOTCH).  There is truly no need for valet parking here.  The resort is equipped with a user friendly parking garage that shows us where the free spots are by using green light for available and red for unavailable and also letting us know how many spots in an area are empty!. . Number 2 has got to be the bathroom... can I curse??? It was an effing experience!!!  I felt the bathroom in a one bedroom suite was the highlight and it would be number 1 but since I have never seen this kind of parking, I had to give it to the parking. . . Anyway, I am not going to write too much.  I know Vegas has plenty of reasonably priced properties, but it would not be an EXPERIENCE without the Cosmopolitan. . . I crave it like my favorite food!!!. . It (in my opinion) is certainly the best - anywhere!!!
My room had a leak on the AC and the puddle got progressively bigger each day which gave the room a funny odor. There was a piece of glass in bathroom so my foot was bleeding, not a great way to start the vacation. Bathroom wasn't throughly cleaned upon arrival. The shower handle was loose, like it would fall off. Plus it hit me in all the wrong place all, water stream and pressure needs some work on. I saw 2 prostitutes enter my elevator with two John, gross, very unclassy. The scene was overall trashy. I saw a drunk girl get carried away in a wheelchair, she was that drunk. The internet fee was ridiculous. Pricy resort but nothing special, don't let the looks fool you. The Wicked Spoon had crappy unappetizing food. I'll stay at other places next time.
Very good stay, had the 1 bedroom apartment, room had plenty of space, very clean and tidy, cool style, had a large bath / bathroom. The was my second time staying at the Cosmo and I highly recommend it. I have stayed at other properties on the strip but I would have to say the Cosmo is my top pick.
Have yet to spend the night here.  Have visited the resort a few times though.  . . Favorite spot is Secret Pizza.  Love ordering pizza from here.  Then taking over to the chairs near the billiard tables.  Great place to eat the yummy pizza, and nice place to people watch.. . When walking along the Las Vegas Strip, make certain to stop into the Cosmopolitan!
I don't know what happened to the cosmo since they got bought out by another investment firm, but their customer service has deffffffffinitely gotten worse. Hotel and casino is still the same, and they even added blackjack tables to the second floor so you can gamble while waiting to get into the marquee. Another then that nothing special.
The Cosmopolitan Hotel is one of the hottest hotels on the strip right now. It is all glamour. Everything is very elegant. In true Vegas style there are several restaurants to choose from and tons of amazing shopping. There is even a Rent the Runway store if you are feeling like getting extra snazzy. I personally enjoy the uniqueness of the themed hotels, but if you are looking for glitz and glamour, this is the place to go!
Beautiful hotel and casino, but no one seems to go here any more.  After a 4-day stay last weekend, I can see why.  The patio glass rail/windows are filthy, obscuring your views.  It's shocking how dirty this place has become within the last couple of years.  During peak hours the men's room in the casino is disgusting.  I've been to cleaner bathrooms at dive bars.  It's not being maintained nor managed properly.  Worst of all, every one of the casino staff this visit was unhappy, unfriendly, and sometimes downright rude.  There is nothing fun about gambling with an unhappy casino staff!  Gone are the days of friendly engaging dealers, bosses, and bartenders, and bustling good times.  This is definitely not the upscale and fun place it once was.. . The shining light here was the restaurants.  Be sure to check out Blue Ribbon sushi, Jaleo Spanish tapas, Holsteins burgers, and even Secret Pizza (see Yelp tips to find this one!).  Expect to pay through the nose (except the pizza), but overall food quality is world-class at all of these places.  Skip the Mexican/Chinese place - not bad but definitely not good.. . I was told that this property has recently changed ownership.  Either that's the problem, or the solution - only time will tell.  I'd consider possibly staying here again, but there are so many better options now, and I certainly wouldn't play this casino again.  Quite a disappointment.
Came here a while ago with the wifey.  She booked on one of those websites with "secret hotels" where you get a random 4 star or 5 star hotel at a discounted rate, but you don't get to select which hotel you want.. . Well, anyways, we ended up getting Cosmopolitan which we definitely happy with as we always wanted to try staying at the Cosmo.  When we checked in, we got a free upgrade from the 26th floor... to the 52 floor!!! For free too!  The view we had was of the Bellagio fountains.. . We had an awesome stay here.
The Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel, i'd stay there again.  I found the decor slick and appealing, has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling..  . I had a reasonably high floor room with a decent view.  I liked how you can kill all the lights with one switch.  The window into the shower stall with a shade plus full wall mirrors opposite the queen beds suggest they are there for one thing..... . The pillows and the rest of the bedding was first rate.. . Access to good restaurants, Blue Ribbon was my favorite but there are a number of good ones.. . One of the plusses is the Cosmo is situated near Aria, so just from a new and updated part of town there is a lot going on there.. . I did not check out the pool, except from 40 floors up.  Looked good.. . I did notice some wear here and there which I was surprised to see in a new property, but then again, it seems like a party hotel so perhaps it take a beating.. . The Casino area is small compared to others on the strip.
I loved my one night stay, a bit of super comfort and big screen news, away from down stairs .I had a very comfortable experience here and a very good value for the money. I had room service, was fast, friendly and the food was delicious as well. I'm sure you can go away from the sleepless city as soon as checking in. Is a great thing to do, one night out, dine and sleep like a king! You can also have breakfast in the restaurant at floor level, good food, coffee and service.
Stayed at this hotel in July 2014 with my 6 y.o granddaughter and we had a great time here.  We love our room with the fountain view. Also the pools are awesome. They thing I don't like is the refrigerator was stocked with all the retail items so there is no space for our own stuffs.  Also housekeeping did not stock back our toiletry items daily.
Oh Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo. This hotel must be one of my favorite places in the world. Let me start off with the casino...although I have lost a small fortune there, the craps table is always lively even around 4 or 5 in the morning , and there are always multiple shiny, new, and loud slot machines that ring a ding ding and catch my attention...I can't resist a good slot machine lol ( More "identity" points for me) i'm not much of a swimmer because I rather spend my days at the casino and evenings partying but the marquee day club, boulevard, and bamboo pools are excellent. I love the frozen strawberry margaritas that you can order by the pitcher at any of these pools. I'm not crazy about Marquee as a nightclub because it's always over packed for no good reason ,there is barely even any space to move at the tables let alone dance on the dancefloor. All that being said, the crowning glory of Cosmopolitan lies in their balcony rooms. Back in June I was there two weekends in a row; the first weekend we had a terrace suite with not one but TWO balconies overlooking the marvelous Las Vegas strip and all the sights to see such as the Bellagio fountain show and the High Roller ferris wheel. The second time around we had a corner balcony suite (one balcony) and the view was just as lovely. If you're going to stay here, opt for a room with a balcony, it's definitely worth the extra money that you could probably gamble away in under an hour anyway.
The staff here are rude, unprofessional and inconsiderate. They had people form a line for the Ed Sheeran concert at the Chelsea. People were told if they left the line for any reason they would have to go to the end of the line. General admissions are standing only so they came hours early to get in line. Security took a few groups of 15 at a time to use the restroom. Then told the rest they could go but it would cost them their place in line. I called to request a bathroom pass for my daughter and I was given an attitude from Miles who works in a call center. He also refused to transfer me to someone working the area or security claiming there were no direct lines. I called back directly to security and was given an attitude by him also. Basically they have no system for lines to avoid cutting except step out of line and lose you place. Which causes people to remain in line regardless. Very cruel. I will NOT purchase tickets for any event held here again.
Very few places take you away into vacation land- this is one of them. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the restaurants, the gaming, and Rose.Rabbit.Lie. Will definitely be back.
I have stayed here numerous times and I absolutely love it!!!  Here are a list of reasons I think this is the best hotel on the strip:. . - Location - situated about in the middle of the action and next to the Bellagio (try and get a fountain facing room) and part of the whole complex of hotels. - Restaurants - there are quite a few great restaurants on the property. The buffet is definitely among the better options in Vegas; Great burger place, Holsteins, with unbelievable milk shakes (with or without liquor); mexican-asian place, etc.. -Pools - three or four pools with great 'scenery.'  There is also the Marquee Club at one of the pools. -Balconies - not many, if any, hotels in Vegas have balconies.  If you can, get a suite - the balcony wraps around and it is unbelievable!. -Marriott property - so if you're like me and like rewards, get in on it. . Other that the above, the Cosmo is definitely more upscale, and higher class than some of the mass casinos located elsewhere.  Won't stay anywhere else!
