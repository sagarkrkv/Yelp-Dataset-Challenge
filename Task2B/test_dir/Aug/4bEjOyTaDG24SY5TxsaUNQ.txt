I frequent often especially with out of town guests- since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the Bellagio watershow. . Food is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak, salmon, etc). I really enjoyed the escargot and my friend loved the baked goat cheese appetizer. Good place over all.
Upon arrival at our reservation time we were immediately shown to a table in the inside area which is pretty dark and tends to be noisy. Additionally it was located adjacent to a door (I think of the swinging type) with a serving cart occupying some of the table space. Rather than sitting down I asked for another table. We were shown to a table in the atrium area (brighter and quieter) which while smaller was significantly better situated. It turned out to be very fine. Both couples shared Caesar salads which were ample and very tasty. The baguette bread they make in house is wonderful and always served fresh and hot. For entrees we ordered two Steak Frites Bordelaise, one Hanger Steak, and the Caramelized Sea Scallops. While the Steak Frites were good, the Hanger Steak my wife ordered was tastier. The Sea Scallops my friend's wife ordered were very good and of course their signature hand cut fries are outstanding. My friend ordered the green beans but after the salad course was told they were out. He then ordered sauteed mushrooms which arrived halfway through the entree. Five minutes later they brought a second order of mushrooms. When we informed the waitress that we already had one order she took the second order back. I'm not sure who those belonged to or went to. They formerly offered a plate of three small profiteroles (cream puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in warm chocolate sauce) for dessert but now it's a single grand profiterole which looks like a chocolate covered jumbo burger. We shared one and thought it was OK but I recall the smaller ones they formerly offered as being more tasty thanks to a softer puff. All in all a good meal at a reliable, fairly priced Strip restaurant.
I can't say enough great thing about Mon Ami Gabi! The Escargot is the best I have ever had! Make sure to get extra bread to dip in the delicious sauce! We've had the mussels and scallops appetizers which were amazing! Steak sandwich, lobster roll and open-faced salmon sandwich also amazing! French Onion soup and split pea soups super delicious! Their Lemon Tart is to die for! My ONLY complaint is they charge $12 for 1 freaking BOTTLE of Blue Moon. Total rip-off! But the prices for food is really good for a French spot on the strip. Everyone has to go there at least once and I promise you will go back! It's that good!
We had a great experience and enjoyed our moment here! Food, service, atmosphere... Other than that I was so impressed with their chef, "Terry Lynch", Executive Chef / Partner. . Because I liked our special soup that was called "Grape and Almond Gazpacho soup" so much and asked our waitress about the ingredients. . She came back and told me that chef Terry will send me the recipe. . The next day I got an email from chef Terry who was so generous and treated his customer so well. It was my first time I ever got this kind of personal touch and i like it.. I would definitely return next time when i visit Las Vegas.
Great place, delicious food, the bananas foster crepes were divine! The service was great too!
Steak frites is one of my favorite dishes and Mon Ami is one of the best that's makes it just right!!!
So delicious, and pretty reasonable for Vegas too! The Brie Cheese appetizer comes served with freshly roasted garlic, which is basically my kryptonite. Mmm garlic!. . I was in Vegas for work (tough life, I know ;) ) and so my coworker and I shared the trout and salmon. (We love seafood!) Both were very good, the salmon came with an interesting pea puree. But, I would not use the word "exceptional." Fast and friendly service, tucked right out front the Paris. Would come back here!
Great food and great service, the pricing is not nearly as high as you would expect for the view, ambiance and the fact that it's right on the strip. Everything I have tried has been very fresh, flavorful and delicious. If you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner without paying an arm and a leg, also getting a great view- this is it!
This place was pretty exceptional on the food and atmosphere front.  It's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  The menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  I ordered the tomato and basil salad.  The waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  It was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  I was thankful I ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  It was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  . I sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the goat cheese and smoked salmon sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  The combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things I've eaten in awhile!  . So why 4 stars and not 5?  The service was lacking.  It's vegas...I expect above average.  Service was average from all the staff I encountered and no one seemed very personable.  Just kind of made me feel awkward.  Oh well, good eats - try it!
Highly recommend eating in the atrium area! Meal was cooked to specification and flavors were fantastic!
we stopped here for lunch and got a very nice strip side table for two, we ordered the seafood tower for two for $49, in my opinion this was an amazing value, we had a wole lobster, 4 fresh oysters, four large prawns, salmon tartare which was absolutely delicious, crackers and dips served on a bed of ice with lemon wedges. Such a great meal on a hot day.
This is a MUST STOP brunch spot for every trip I take to Las Vegas! The service is always wonderful, the food is impeccable, and the gorgeous patio views of the strip is an added perk. It's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. . . I always order the Croque Monsieur (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). Frankly, it's so deliciousthat I never have the desire to stray from it. It's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. The hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! . . My most recent visit was particularly memorable. Mark Z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). We showed up around 9am on a Sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the Bellagio fountains. . . We started our meal with the baked goat cheese (about $12) and I can definitely say that I will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. The tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the goat cheese was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! . . My boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! . . All in all, this place is absolutely incredible and I recommend it to every single person that I know that is taking a Vegas vacation! Kudos, Mon Ami, Gabi!
Went here for the Bloody Mary bar but the breakfast itself was delicious!! This is such a good choice for breakfast/brunch in Vegas that isn't a buffet.  I got the special of the day which was lemon crepes with blueberries and homemade whipped cream.  Will definitely be back here!
What a wonderful time, al Fresco dining overlooking the Bellagio and the strip, our waiter looked like Mosely from Downton Abby! He spoiled us with fine recommendations and great service also accommodating our gluten free friends at the table. I had the chicken apple and Brie Crepes -- wonderful tender crepes and the sweet of the apples and the savory chicken was a great combination! Frizee salads with smoked lardons (pork belly) was a party in the mouth, the prime rib Benedict with house made English muffin was wonderful . Must try!
Got to sit outside, directly across the street from the Bellagio. This location is perfect for people watching. . . The wait staff were absolutely perfect. A a somewhat picky patron, and former waiter myself, these folks were perfect. They were always around when I wanted something, and never hovering when I didn't. No one did that thing where they bring you your food, and two seconds later, ask how is everything before you've even taken a bite.. . I had the french onion soup, the frise/kale/bacon salad, and a burger with blue cheese, bacon, and fried egg. All were awesome. I'd order all again.. . I highly recommend this place. Including two glasses of wine, the whole bill was $64.11 for two people. Technically, that makes it fall into the $$$ category, but it's on the low end of it.
Best breakfast ever on our wedding day! It is a must go place.
I finally got to try this restaurant during Spring time! This place is usually super packed however the night that I went I was one of the lucky ones and didn't have to wait :) I got to sit outside right in front of the Bellagio water show, it was definitely magical at night! . . Their escargot is highly recommended and I also recommend their steaks and seafood. This place is as good as it gets for French Cuisine. Not to mention, their customer service is exceptional. I will definitely come again when I go to Vegas again!
I had the special, red snapper, deliciously prepared. I substituted the potatoes successfully.  The service has been excellent. Prices were definitely in the $$$ range so the yelp rating of $$ made the prices a bit of a shock.  Great atmosphere and we would come back.
Love Mon Ami Gabi! Onion soup is very good also VERY hot. Incredible tasting fish dishes - favorite is the Trout Amandine. Bananas Foster Crepe has be the BEST dessert in the city. It's decadent. Fun atmosphere - a bit loud in the atrium. Must try their Gluten Free items next time. Wines are delicious and affordable for being on the Strip. Bon Appetitie!
I had an excellent dinner experience here on a Friday night. We sat right by the window and go to watch the Bellagio water show. I ordered the filet with a side of the cauliflower mash. Delicious. I am Paleo, so it was nice that they had options for gluten-free, although the fresh french bread looked pretty amazing. . . I came back the next afternoon for lunch/brunch on Sunday, and the food was great, but the service was sub-par. The server, I believe his name was Jose, was not friendly. Maybe he was having a bad day, which we all have, but it was unfortunate it had to impact our experience. My grandma asked him for a glass of ice, and he completely forgot to get it. Another server, at our request, had to bring it over. When taking our order, he seemed to be distracted. My mom asked if the kale salad had bacon, and he said it did. She asked if she can have it on the side. He said she could not because it was in the dressing. My mom got the salad, with bacon on the salad, and the dressing on the side (that had no bacon in it). The man who delivered the food was very nice, and took the food back. He apologized. Our server did not apologize, never said anything about giving us incorrect information, just said the other salad is on the way. . . I recommend this place for dinner. It was great. It was too bad we received the bad service at lunch, but I would still try it again.
I had dinner here last week with family.  What an excellent experience!  We sat on the patio on a comfortable Friday night.  People was watching was fun.  We saw a lot of underdressed tourists and even saw a fight almost happen.  Didn't happen.  That was okay.  We saw a fight the next day at the Linq.. . We all shared escargots and mussels for appetizers.  The escargots were great in a very hot parsley butter sauce, and the mussels were very good also.  Be sure you have enough bread do "sop up" the sauce from the mussels.  . . For dinner, I ordered one of the three dinner specials, sole with roasted potatoes and lightly sauteed spinach.  I was surprised that I got an entire sole (four filets).  Again, it was prepared very well, not overcooked.. . For dessert, we shared a very light and flavorful chocolate mousse and a rich creme brulee which was full of vanilla beans.. . We lingered for over two hours laughing and watching the fountain show across the street.  The food, the staff, the ambiance, and most important the company made for a great dining experience!
Reservations for dinner definitely help - huge line out the door for drop ins.  Very good food, well schooled waiters, great view.  We sat outside watching people and the fountains.  Despite the coolness factor, I would advise against it.  First - the various artists and peddlers on the sidewalk - it's loud and annoying from time to time.  Second - constant waves of cold from the a/c and the heat from the street.  Compared to that - inside the restaurant looked muted and inviting - and somehow much more "French".  Excellent experience overall!
We were completely relocated (in our minds) to Paris for breakfast.  Even our waitress had a totally "French" attitude.  After such a good breakfast we can't wait to return for lunch or dinner.
Been a couple of times, once for dinner once for lunch. Lunch was the more recent visit and I ended up doing Steak Frites. . . I love French and this place is quite good at it, though not in a way that makes me jump for joy everytime. I think the best thing this place has going for it is the view, clearly. . . The food itself is fine, but their steak frites weren't cooked properly (over cooked, no biggie...but hey, this is Vegas at a place known around the world) . The fries though, those were damn good. . . Wait staff was decent enough, though getting drinks refilled was kinda a challenge.. . Mon Ami Gabi is a great Vegas spot for just about anyone; fancy enough and well known enough to warrant a visit...but its not exactly amazing when it comes to the food. Still good to go for a decent meal.
EXCELLENT food combined with friendly and prompt service makes this place one of the best restaurants on the strip.  Get there early 'cause it gets busy quick!! They open for breakfast at 7 am.  I know it's a bit unusual to think about coffee while reviewing a French restaurant but they have some of the best around, it's why I started going and only one of the reasons I keep going back!!
Lively atmosphere and qualify French food. We enjoyed the roasted chicken, steak Roquefort and French Onion soup but the best part was the chocolate mousse. Our server was polite and patient even though it was a busy night. However, some of the other assisting servers were less patient as they practically threw our dishes at us as they rushed to wait other tables.
I had a great dinner experience here. Food was excellent and our server Matt was awesome! He was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Best customer service ever!
Quality food. Great view when dining on the patio.
This is our go-to place for brunch in Vegas. Everything my husband and I have tried here is fabulous! The patio is beautiful and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
I've been coming here for close to a decade. Best meal for the price in Vegas. Never disappoints. If you can wait, try for the terrace or our favorite the pavilion. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the frites are irresistible.  For those that like seafood, the scallops have never been less than spectacular.. . This restaurant has the vibe of a bustling French bistro, with the added plus of a friendly but very professional staff. Can't recommend enough!
I don't like steaks that are that flat. But it was average. The frites were a nice addition. The service was good. The ambiance is great for a date.
BECKY!!!!!! LOVE HER. Anna Nicole Smith+Jessica Simpson...I digress...her customer service, expertise, and sense of humor are exceptional. My husband and I are self proclaimed foodies and we had a blast at bar with her. She made us a Texas Mule and I Loved it. Then, we had the Paris in Bloom and enjoyed thoroughly. Really great experience. The managers even came over to shake our hands.
Mon Ami Gabi was one of the best restaurants I visited in Las Vegas. The food and the service were great and the price was even better. Food on the strip can be outrageous! Mon Ami Gabi was well priced with good food. I suggest eating outside on the patio if you can so you can watch the water show at the Bellagio.
A fantastic meal on the strip for a reasonable price! . . It is easy to make a reservation for the day of, so if you are a last minute planner like us, at least you can rest assured that you will have a nice place to dine on the strip!. . Although the interior of the restaurant looks upscale and all the servers are outfitted in dress pants and vests, it is actually a very casual dining atmosphere. The menu consists of an assortment of salads, seafoods, and steaks, and although the options are limited, it shouldn't be hard to find a dish for everyone. . . At the end of the meal, our server brought the bachelorette a cream puff/ice cream dessert on the house, which I thought was a really sweet gesture. It was just enough to pass around the table and for all of us to try a bite. Delish! :)
Bread is amazing. . Food is on par. From the steak, salmon, soup, and sandwiches everything tastes great.. Service is excellent. Very friendly and welcoming.. . I would definitely come back to try more items on their menu and would recommend my friends here on their trip to Vegas (:
Amazing steak! I don't really know much about the rest of the menu items, since I think 99% of our party of 20 ordered steak. I ordered the classique. Word of warning, the steaks are pounded thin, so order one level down for what you usually order (e.g. if you usually order medium, order medium rare). My medium steak was borderline medium-well, so it was a tad bit drier than I usually like. The fries that came with the steak were unique and very crispy. . . Our server was knowledgeable and patient with our huge party. It was overall a fantastic experience!
Sooooo delicious! They do undercook the steak a bit, but it was still delicious . They have the best fries I've ever had! I had some of my boyfriends steak sandwich and it was really good as well. Very nice servers too
I have been here many times and have never had a bad experience...well, there was the short ribs...  No matter, I LOVE this place.  If you've been to the Strip, you know the prices, but this place is pretty moderate and the food is always top notch.  I always get the baked goat cheese app - so yummy.  I've had most of the other menu items, most recently, the snapper special......which had a browned butter and corn sauce over it which knocked me socks off.  Also had steak tartare for the first time. I may be spoiled from having it here, but, oh my, delicious!  Our waitress was funny and fantastic too, wish I remembered her name.  Pigtails....you know who you are :)
Beautiful to sit on patio and watch the Bellagio fountains. Service great as was food. Wonderful place to enjoy the sights of the Strip.
Despite of the fact that this place can be infested with tourists, this is actually one of our favorite breakfast joints in the valley.  Best way to dine at this place is by eating at their patio and preferably near the railing, no other exceptions.  Make sure to have a reservation especially if you decide to eat at this restaurant on a weekend or expect for your party to wait until the next table is ready.  Wait time, however, is usually nonexistent if you do show up early enough.  At least they have two bars conveniently inside the establishment that serve any alcoholic beverage you desire as you wait for your name to be called.. . Watch out for their daily specials as they're actually quite delicious.  One dish I tend to go for is their crepe stuffed with chicken, brie and apples topped with a beurre blanc sauce...amazing!!  Another great choice would be the eggs florentine with a side of date-glazed bacon.. . Overall, Mon Ami Gabi has definitely become an institution that everyone seems to keep raving about.  Great at any time of day; come here for brunch with your friends or an intimate dinner with her while having one of the best seats in town to watch the Bellagio fountain show.
Love this place. Ask for patio seating. The view of the Bellagio is awesome. I usually go there for breakfast. Very reasonable price for the quality of the foods and service. And the fact it's on the strip.
It's one of those places that has a limited menu.  I don't like that.  I'm picky and I need variety.  Lost a star for that.  . . Thursday night, no reservations but there was no wait to sit inside.  There was a 1 hour wait to sit on the patio.  Service was very friendly.  We ended up ordering the French Onion Soup, Scallops and Chicken Grandmere.  French Onion Soup was good.  Most places make theirs too salty but this is a French restaurant so they better get that right.  Scallops were average.  They were good but it wasn't anything special.  Chicken was very good.  One of the best chickens I've had in a restaurant.  A little bit pricey for a casual restaurant but then again it is on the Strip.  I didn't think the food was that special.  There are dozens of other restaurants back home in Orange County that are just as good, if not better, for the same price.
Pros: Great view of the Bellagio Fountains (right across the street), ample seating. Decent food.. . Cons: Food could have been better considering the price. Likewise for the service. I've had much better steaks for less. . . Overall: Worth doing if you're in the area and wanting some decent food without worrying about a dress code. We had no problem getting a table at 6pm on a Monday, but on weekends you would want to get a reservation (easy to do online)
The patio seating is lovely at night and a constant source of entertainment as it looks out over the Strip and the human circus thereon.. . Our waiter was French. How awesome was that having a (polite) waiter with a French accent provide you dinner while sitting uder the Eifel tower.. . The food was excellent with the expected French influence. We had the salmon, filet and trout. All were well prepared and well presented in addition to being tasty and well seasoned.
Came to Mon Ami Gabi cause we heard amazing things from friends and via Yelp! . . Atmosphere was romantic. Dimly lit, cute parisian decorations and really just perfect. It was windy and hot that day so we opted for a window seat but inside the restaurant vs patio and still got an amazing view of the bellagio fountain shows. We ordered the escargot, mussels, bone in ribeye with a side of sauteed mushrooms, and creme brulee.. . The FOOD verdict:. . Escargot...a bit TOO chewy and really bland considering it was being drowned in garlic butter :(. . Mussels were DELICIOUS! I wish we got an entire full order vs half order....mmmmn! best item of the night :D. . Bone in Ribeye so mediocre and considering it took an hour after ordering to come out you would think it would be amazing but nope! . . Sauteed Mushrooms don't order, not worth it and even more tasteless than the ribeye. . . Creme Brulee was very good! But i don't think I've ever had a bad creme brulee...LOL . . Overall food was meh and it took forever for our main course! . . Service: . . Hostess were a bit snobby and were kinda rude when I asked for a photo. Our server Dawn was nice at first but she had a really condescending tone when I would ask about the whereabouts of our food. And listening to her talk to another table I could tell she may have just been having a bad day cause she was rude to them too. . . Basically view and atmosphere were amazing and romantic! Food was 2/5 and service from hostess and server were 1/5. . . Step up your game Mon Ami Gabi, there's too many good restaurants on the strip for you to be acting like the only hot french girl in the room.
This place always has an extremely long line at any hour of the day! I came here for breakfast at 10 am on a Wednesday. The patio was completely full but we were seated in the greenhouse area which is just as lovely. The decor at this place is classic and authentic. Their breakfast menu is very large and has everything from large entrees to little pastries. . I decided on the lemon pancakes. The pancake is large and very thin, more like a crepe than a pancake. It is served with lemon marmalade and cream. It sounds simple but it was one of the most delicious brunch items I have ever tasted! The marmalade was so flavorful and you could tell it was all made from real lemons. I would definitely come back if I had a reservation, but the long wait is definitely off-putting.
Mouth watering dishes! All of them! Yeah, I'm the type to pick off everyone's plates. Don't judge me! and I'm Such a sucker for outdoor patios!! Vegas weather does get a bit crazy, but you have a choice. Of sitting in the indoor patio! What? Yes!! Get the steak and the sandwiches. all of them. Take it Togo if you can't finish it cause it taste equally amazing hours later in traffic or on the plane!
Really good food. Good service our waiter was friendly and had a good sense of humour. Service was really fast considering they were packed. Prices are reasonable especially for the quality of food and for being on the Strip.
GREAT for Gluten-Free dining. They have amazing gluten-free bread and very knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend the French Onion Soup!
I think this place is being exagerated. The service is fast but unfriendly. The breeads were not fresh. Waste of money :(
Tried the Au poivre which was incredibly tasty and tender, along with crispy and homemade fries for 25$ total.. The restaurant had calm background music and high class service, 5/5
The service is excellent. The food, drinks and ambiance superb!!! A bit pricey for breakfast but money well spent
After all of the amazing reviews I saw on yelp I was so excited to come here for my last morning in Vegas. Mannn what a disappointment. My poached eggs were overcooked and the salmon was kind of dry. Not exactly the delicious breakfast I was looking for unfortunately.
Centrally located, so it's a wonderful place to grab brunch and get your day started on the strip, which is exactly what we did when I brought my parents here.  . . We had a reservation for 10:30 and I was a bit annoyed because I told them my name and for some reason the hostess kept coming over and loudly insisting "RICHARD?????" in my face.  Lady, I told you 3x my name is not Richard, your screaming the name in my face is not going to change that fact.  . . Despite that, however, the service during our meal was very good.  Our server was Jose and he was very busy but quick and attentive.  We had coffee, a bellini and a mimosa and all were strong and delicious.  . . I had the steak frites, my dad had themushroom omelette and my mom had a breakfast croissant sandwich, and we all split the fruit bowl.  . . Everything was quite good EXCEPT FOR MY STEAK FRITES.  It is double the price of the other breakfast entrees and the meat was tough and the fries were weird.  I spent most of my meal wishing I'd ordered something different.  . . The decor and ambiance here are lovely and reminiscent of Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  I'll probably come back here for breakfast/brunch next time I'm in Vegas but I'll definitely be skipping the steak frites.
Me and my boyfriend came here on a Friday night with an 8pm dinner reservation, and were seated within 5 minutes. (Reservation highly recommended as this place will get busy!). . The hostesses, bus staff, and our waitress were all friendly and attentive to us even though the place was pretty packed.. . We ordered the escargot, scallops gratinee, salmon, and French green beans. All the dishes were fresh and tasty and came out fairly quickly. . . The pricing is great especially for Vegas, and the atmosphere is nice although it is a really dark/romantic type of atmosphere if you go at night. . . Would definitely go back to try more of the menu!
love this place - the food, atmosphere, drinks, all of the above.  It's a go to spot for us when we are in Vegas!
Terrible service. Very disappointed because I had heard great things. Made a reservation for 745 but still had to wait for 35 mins. Hostess was extremely rude, her name Christina. I was talking to her and she was purposely looking over me and not responding. Not a good start to dinner and not impressed with customer service.
Great food and great service. The hand cut frites are so crispy and flavored. The steak is also perfectly done. Love this place
I had an AMAZING experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!. . I made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to Strip traffic. The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!. . When making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). . . As for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, sauteed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS!  One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce!  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  I would not recommend the sauteed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. . . The service at Mon Ami Gabi was great!  Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. . . If you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place!  I will definitely return!
I was very pleased with my experience here! The hostesses that helped us out were very friendly and accommodated our request to outdoor seating and we got the best view of the water show from The Bellagio! Our server Cetap was attentive and friendly, we never had to ask for water once(my bf and I drink water like a fish too lol). My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with Merlot, and I ordered the rib eye. The steaks were AMAZING!!!!! Although, I would prefer the filet mignon over the rib eye :p. We then ordered the banana crepe for dessert and it was D E L I C I O U S! The sauce that came with the crepe went amazingly well with the bananas and ice cream, ITS A MUST TRY!! Amazing first experience and I will dine here again with Cetap! :)
Our favorite restaurant!  I love the Pavillion room ambiance and the steak frites are the bomb!
We love this place. It is a must stop for us whenever we visit Las Vegas. Lunch on the patio watching the fountains and the Human Circus. The food is always great, the servers are entertaining, cocktails are good and wine list is too.
Service was great when the restaurant was packed.  The portions were very small for the price and food was ok
I don't live in Vegas.. but if I did.. I'd be here every day. Amazing food.
Made reservations here for brunch and wasn't disappointed. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was relaxed yet sophisticated. Our waitress, Rosa (I think), was very nice and competent but was sometimes slow to get back to us. . My fiance and I shared the special, open face lamb sandwich , and the salmon and spinach salad. Both were amazing! Rosa suggested the sangria as a great compliment to our food and she was right. We also ordered the fruit bouquet and for desert the blueberry crepe for him and the strawberry cake for me. May I suggest, sharing deserts, they are huge! We didn't finish. Definitely try this place when you're at Paris, Las Vegas.
I've been in the restaurant business most of my life.  I have eaten everywhere and let me tell you, Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant in the world. You will not find a better combination of unpretentiousness, view, ambience, food quality and preperatipon anywhere.  Get ready for a simple, but fantastic meal.
Love it.  Amazing food in an amazing atmospere at an amazing location.  What more could you ask for?
Favorite place to eat on the strip!
Had an amazing experience here last week  with seven other girls. Everyone's food was fresh, hot and delish. Everyone decided to have the steak so I obviously had a salad and scallops hoping to finish everyone's steak (which of course I did)!!! I had the soft boiled and bacon salad- oh so yum. Imagine a nice fresh salad covered in bacon and a warm soft boiled egg over. As you cut the egg the magical yolk pours over the salad. The salad also has little pieces of toast that soak up the egg yolk. I'm salivating as I write this. Then I had the scallops gratin which was amazing. Fresh scallops smothered in buttah and cheese baked to perfection. Get a piece of warm baguette to dip and you are in business. Then I tried everyone's steak and every style was amazing. I prefer the classic butter- medium rare but everyone style was wonderful. I love the fries too- they are fried but not greasy. Dip those bad boys in bearnaise sauce and you've got fireworks. We also had the chocolate mousse which was rich and decadent. For drinks we split the sangria which was flavorful and strong! Yum! Loved this meal.
Came here again from California.  I was seated right away, and the food came very quickly.  Oysters were okay this time around, but the steak classique really rocks my world.  Also the warm goat cheese and garlic bread were to die for.  Will be coming back soon!
I came here on the 20th with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We came because it seemed nice, not crazy expensive (it is Vegas-so pretty much everything is expensive!), and I had heard we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio if we requested the patio. We waited about an hour for the patio because it was a busy night, but we didn't care because the slot machines are right outside so we got to play a bit before we ate! The ambiance was really romantic, the service was excellent- our busser Nester was seriously on top of things with drinks, and the food was to die for. He got the steak bourdelaise, and I had the filet mingnon merlot, both with whipped potatoes. I highly recommend both. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and pretty much melted in our mouths! We also had the waiters wine recommendation, which was lovely, and the creme brulee. Best creme brulee I've had in a while! Also, I felt like the wait was worth it for the food, and the fountains did really help to make our special night even more special.
Vegas started off on a weird note and I was thoroughly annoyed with some of the people in my group. However Mark totally turned things around with awesome recommendations and great service. Attentive and funny, Mark listened to all our over the top requests and modifications with a smile. He made sure my friend's bacon was extra crispy as requested (a little burnt if you ask me lol). He made sure all the toppings were on the side per another patrons request and he kept the drinks flowing. Now it's starting to look a lot like Vegas! Then the water show at the Bellagio across the street was spectacular!!! We were able to dine al fresco but still take advantage of the AC. We couldn't tell it was 105 degrees out or that the breeze was actually artificial. For Vegas, the food was reasonable priced, brunch including 2 mimosas tip and tax was $40-45 pp.
I've dined here multiple times and enjoyed it both times. Most recently I had a casual lunch with my sister. The atmosphere is wonderful, staff is attentive and friendly and the food is fantastic.
This is my favorite place for a relaxed brunch (non-buffet) with a view. I love the french cuisine! I ordered the french toast with mixed fruits, and my bf got the seafood crepe. We also ordered the appetizer pate which was of ginormous proportions. We got a seat on the pavilion so there was the benefit of the cool/AC, yet we still had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and people watching on the Strip. It's a perfect place for that lazy, drawn-out, 3 hour Sunday brunch with amazing savory and sweet dishes.. . I felt that the prices were extremely reasonable for the Strip (and the fact we averaged $92 per person per meal during our trip) and what we received.
There's nothing more satisfying after a day walking the strip in 100 degree heat than a nice steak and a glass of wine.  It's kinda pricey, but hey, you're in Vegas.  Treat yourself.  You won't regret it.  . . Oh, there's usually a long wait, so plan ahead.  We killed time by gambling and drinking, which was fun.
Mon Ami Gabi was a bit expensive- maybe more expensive than the food warranted.  BUT the food really was yummy and definitely worth it since we were celebrating a special bachelorette party weekend.  Unlike many French restaurants, the portions were decent as well. They weren't what us Americans consider large but realistically, I think the portions were perfectly appropriate.  The food was delicious, just not as unique I would have expected from a French restaurant- but maybe their options are broader for dinner (we went for brunch).  The service was absolutely perfect!  Our server (who was clearly French) was friendly and checked up on us regularly (our water glasses were never empty) but he never felt invasive either.  He was polite and direct, and overall it was the best place we ate all weekend- comfortable and casual, yet classy and non-invasive.  I would definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a special night out.

I have eaten here numerous times now and every time the experience has been amazing. The food is absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh and flavorful. The prices are so reasonable! the service is amazing. I just cant say enough good things. Its a must try! :)
Dinner was nice! The waitress did everything she could to make us feel comfortable. Food was great! Athmosphere is vibrant and the interior of the restaurant cosy. . Only downside was the cold air coming from the air condition which was way too chilly.
This restaurant is located in the Paris casino/resort.  Dine on the patio for a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were seated immediately even though we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  Great wine selection.  The oysters on the half-shell were served very cold and very fresh.  Select your main and side dish separately.  We ordered creme brulee for dessert; it was wonderful.  I give this restaurant four stars instead of five because the food was very good, but not the best I've ever had.
Mon Ami NEVER disappoints me. Large wine list ,,,with a good selection of reasonably priced wines. Salads always fresh and inventive with the seasons...same for soups....Cream of mushroom rich and creamy . Frites always crisp and tasty..not greasy. Complimentary bread always warm and FRESH and CRISP..... Accompanying tapenade tasty and fresh. My favorites: any of the fresh fish.                       Hamburger moist and well-seasoned. Breakfast menu has plenty of reasonable entrees. Professional, friendly,knowledgeable servers. Fun to sit on the patio
Great place!!! I had the oysters, trout, and peach melba. The oysters and peach melba were terrific. The trout was good but I've had better. Our server, Chris, was really sharp. . . Fun to watch the Bellagio fountains and people watching.
Not fantastic for the price you will pay for dinner. The view from the patio was nice. We enjoyed eating outside. The French onion soup and the bread were the highlight of my meal. The salmon entree wasn't anything special nor were the pricey, small side dishes.
This is one of my 5 all time favorite places I've ever eaten at. We went multiple times on our trip. The staff went above and beyond each time. Always a smile & friendly. loved being able to sit in the fresh air & people watch. Gorgeous place to get dessert & watch the bellagio fountain show. First morning I got croissant sandwich. If you love avocado this is a yummy perfect breakfast sandwich. Second morning I had to have the hash & poached eggs ( ask for some jelly with your toast very good). Hubby got it the day before & it's truly amazing. I NEED to find the recipe for this online somewhere. Also got myself a pain au chocolate. This is a true must you won't regret it.
Another home run! My high school friends rarely fails me but we never studied the French equivalent for "cleared the fence".  . If you ever find yourself in Sin City, don't walk by without grabbing a strip side seat and glass of freshly squeezed juice in the morning.. The portion size is plentiful and the date covered bacon should be recognized as an equal gift to the US just like the Statue of Liberty.. My slight ding against the 5 stars is that our server seemed a bit rattled and non existent to our table of three.  She inquired about our need for jam and butter and returned with it when we asked for the check. My waistline benefited with the lack of turn around!
I have three words for Mon Ami Gabi: 1.) Perfect 2.) Perfect and 3.) Perfect.  This restaurant on the strip and inside the Paris Hotel & Casino is just perfect. From the extensive cocktail list, the extensive beer list to the assortment of cheeses to the menu of quality French food, you simply cannot lose! If you sit outside on the veranda there is great tourist/people watching and the weather is always sunny in Las Vegas. They also have a vast variety/selection of Bloody Mary's (they used to have a Sunday brunch Bloody Mary Bar).  It's the perfect place for the perfect lunch. Did I mention that it was perfect? Because...it is.
***BEST Salmon Egg Benedict that I have ever tasted!!!! . . This place has one of the best views of the Bellagio foundations, so I highly recommend eating outside. I originally wanted to check out this place because of the reviews. Although I didn't really get to tried what I wanted to tried at this place I went for the alternative. Aside from the view, Mon Ami Gabi has the BEST Salmon Egg Benedict that I have ever tried. The poached egg was PURFECT done. I don't know that they did to the egg, but it just seem to have more yolk oozing out of that thing. The lemon sauce it worked so well with the entire plate. I really have no complaints about this place. I really cannot wait to tried their French Onion Soup, escargot and the beef wellington. That day will soon come!!!. . RECOMMENDATIONS:. . 1. Salmon Egg Benedict (5+/5- BEST in LAS VEGAS)
One of the best finds we had on our Vegas get-away. The staff is wonderful and the food was terrific.
Service was excellent waitress was very friendly my wife and I both ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked we sat outside so you could not ask for a better view definitely worth the money in fact kind of inexpensive considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's directly across the street from the fountains at Bellagio
Yummy!  Great view of the  Bellagio Fountain show.
Second time here, there wasn't any wait to be seated for lunch unless you want to sit in the patio. . . We sat for 8 minutes before anybody acknowledged us, and as he took our drink orders he tried rushing us to order our foods as well. As we were ordering he had the nerve to walk away mid order and talk with his fellow waiter. Is this real life?. About 5 minutes after he took our order we don't have our drinks, and we noticed that everybody around us had baguettes as soon as they sat down.. Fast forward to around 25 minutes after seating, our table looks exactly as it did the moment we sat down. No drinks, no bread, no attention from any of the many waiters/food runner around the place.  I had to go hunt down our waiter and ask for some bread and water or something.. Anything.. Finally the 34th minute of our dining experience we got our bread and drinks, and our food soon after. . My steak sandwich was cut vertically? I thought that was weird, imagine going to quizno sub and getting your sandwich cut vertically in the middle.. The steak had NO flavor! The fries chips were delicious but the bread completely overpowers the meat in that sandwich. . The tuna sandwich, macaroni, and quiche were delicious as well. Although I thought that somebody split salt in the tuna sandwich.. Overall,. Food: 7/10. Service: 2/10
I went here for breakfast this morning and it wasn't particularly good considering the price ($18 after tax and tip).  They did have some pretty good table bread, which my girlfrind really seemed to enjoy.. . If you're hungry and looking for somewhere to eat then it's fine, we got seated very quickly at 11:30 on Labor Day Sunday.  Just don't really expect to get anything you couldn't make yourself.
Great service and a great meal!!
Good food. Attentive staff who take food alergias seriously. Fantastic place for breakfast in the enclosed patio you get the benefit of being outside while escaping the heat.
Everything here is delicious. I've never had a bad meal. . . Make sure to sit on the patio for a view of the fountains and great people watching!. . Some things we've had:. Seafood crepe. Scallops. Chicken &Brie sandwich. Steak sandwich. Salmon Salad
