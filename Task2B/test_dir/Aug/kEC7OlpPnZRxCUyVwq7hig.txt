Visit was in May of 2014:. As a BIG fan of music, I was excited to hit this place up. I walked in and my eyes widened at the sight of Sex Pistols memorabilia and I spent a great deal of time walking the entire floor to look at all of the goodies. Unfortunately my excitement was short lived... . . My friend and I sat down at some slot machines. We were carded immediately which is ok. It happens. However, this happened every single 5 minutes. I am not exaggerating. I was carded by the same woman 3 times! I moved to a different area and was again carded by two other guys working the floor. I made a comment to the guy carding me and said wow man every 5 minutes I'm going to be carded, really? And he laughed at me and said I highly doubt that. Had a very poor attitude. Please let me add in that I was here on a weekday and the casino floor was EMPTY. The bars were empty and there were a few scattered people throughout. I wasn't lost in a crowd where they had to continuously card me. There was nobody there! Their poor attitudes and eventual HARASSMENT, drove me out of the place. Yes I use the word harassment because that's exactly what it was! I left very unhappy and I will NEVER return to this place again. What a disappointment.
It's far off the strip but one my best friends love rock music so I opted to visit. It was okay. Boring for a non rock fan.
Good:. Location is slightly off the strip, which was nice for us because there was a CVS across the street and local food spots were never slammed busy. . Valet guy RICHIE was awesome. Woman at the front desk (cant remember her name sorry!) was awesome as well. All staff members we spoke to were wonderful and accomidating.. Food inside the hotel is good.. Bed is comfortable.. Rooms are clean.. . Bad: . We were on a nonsmoking floor, but half of the time our room / hallways stunk of cigarettes and weed.. Lights in room only work at certain times of the day. . Rooms are small. Hotel is FREEEEEZING
First timer staying here and have to say that their customer service at registration and the central bar was awesome!! They were super accommodating and made our first few moments at this hotel wonderful! What a lovely way to start a vacation.
Good:. For the most part, the room was spacious, very presentable. Location was off the strip and away from the traffic, but close enough to get to the trip when need be.. . BAD:. Our room got broken into and burglarized.  Not everything was stolen- but +$100 cash, 2 macbooks, ipad, and dj set was stolen. Filed a complaint, hotel report and police report as well.
I signed up for Yelp just to express how awful this hotel is. . For starters, this hotel is NOT accommodating to medical issues. I expressed to the reservations desk that I have a food allergy which necessitated me to bring all of my food for our week-long vacation. When asked, they explained to me that there are no refrigerators in the room, but one could be provided for $20 a day. Absurd. I even offered to provide a note from my doctor confirming my very serious food allergy (so they didn't think I was making this up just to have a fridge), and she was very rude and would not help me.. The room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. But taking into consideration that there is no refrigerator, microwave, or coffee pot in the room, it was way too pricey.. Our room keys failed three times, and we kept having to get them remade over and over.. The pools are very nice. But the music from the DJ is so loud that I could barely talk to my husband. It would be nice to have at least one day a week, or a portion of the day where there isn't relentless party music. I thought the pools would be relaxing, but it was annoying, and the music was the same.... it was the same songs on the same loop every day.. Also, considering that I am staying at the hotel, I should not have to pay $50 a day to use the pool on the weekends because of the Rehab pool party.. Overall, this was a terrible hotel experience, and I walked away feeling like I had thrown a lot of my money down the drain.
The Hard Rock Casino is a really fun place to play.  I really dig the youthful and energetic vibe, and of course the music is awesome.  I couldn't help but hum and sing along the background music while playing blackjack, something I'm sure everyone else at the table appreciated.  When it wasn't the music distracting my game, it was the beautiful Hell's Belles.  Good times.
The room was filthy. The carpets would have you believe they don't own a vacuum. Fixtures were broken. Every outlet was bashed in and broken so the few that actually worked required you to either hold plugs in or they'd fall right out. People were staying in the rooms to drink loudly at all hours. Annoying at times, but not unexpected. However, the jagged broken glass aftermath in the hallway that remained for a FULL day and night was completely unacceptable. They charge a resort fee, presumably for amenities, yet any and all amenities are banned to anyone below 21. They advertise a nice pool, but this is clearly excluded from the price as an 18-20 year old cannot at any time use this and is delegated to a 3' kiddie pool for no apparent reason as this is still entirely littered with abandoned beers and half drunk alcoholic beverages.
Had a groupon deal at this place VERY last minute, so I had little to no expectations.. But wowzas!! Did we luck out! The room was nice, different, very rock n rolling, hence the name..the patio view was amazing but my favorite part was the bathroom! Normally  a huge germaphobewhen it comes to hotel bathrooms but it was very clean,and the shower was HUGE! The tub part went higher than my knees, I literally almost had to climb in..lol so not ideal for really old people.. I didn't go with the 5 stars because of something really minor! Only because I tried to extend the room for another night and they were going to charge over $200 when I paid only $50 the night before..on a Tuesday. Umm, no thanks! But hey, not their fault but if u can use a groupon.. DO IT!!
If I could put a zero I would.  Worst  . Customer service!! We had do not disturb on the door and the maid came in anyway! No consideration for your privacy. We called to complain and they said they would send a supervisor up. We waited over an hour and still no supervisor. We called three times! At the pool they charged us for coconut water we never ordered coconut water nor did we get coconut water. That was only one issue we had with our bill. They charge for everything.  I recommend you stay at the Cosmopolitan.  Cosmo is a bit more money but you get what you pay for. Rooms are nice at hard rock but service is non existent.
Awesome hotel. Got a really cheap deal for the nights we stayed. The juice bar I would highly recommend! The beds were amazing! Rehab was fabulous even though they don't except pre loaded cards which is disappointing considering that's all we had. And last but not lease I will warn everyone that is reading this don't go to the fuel cafe inside.
came here for a work meeting. not the best choice from my company as many folks roamed the hallways in swim cloths. not a family hotel. also the layout was very strange. would not stay here again
Very nice casino! It's what I expect when I walk into any Hard Rock franchise. The rooms are very spacious and they have a lot of cool shops inside. I did not get to try Pinks Tacos but next time I will. The staff is very courteous and there is plenty of parking. The only knock is its a mile off the strip but I do not mind walking here to burn off the calories from the beers I drank. It is worth a walk or a cab ride to come here.
I expected better. They charged 25$ a night for service fee, The housekeeping lady came into my room twice while i was changing and when i told her not to come in she still did. They have to make phone calls when their finished cleaning rooms, and they did it while i was in the room as well, which i found a little rude. . When i came there, they made me wait in the pool for 2 hours because my room wasn't ready, and they were going to charge me an additional fee if i checked in early. I was just really mad with their service because there was packed line and there was only 3 people standing at the counter. . The pool was okay, they had white sand and it was burning hot. Overall, it's an okay hotel, i just expected better
The good: great food, great people, great hardscape and pools and all. . The bad: we stayed in the HRH tower 1. An upgrade to a suite, 15th floor. When we entered our suite the first thing that came to mind was the term 'road hard put away wet'. Yes, the room is dated. Everything very dirty looking. Like putting lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. On the last day as we were searching for everything possibly misplaced, my wife found a used condom under the dresser (Lol!).  Married, not ours. As far as the stains on the couches, I will let you figure that one out. Had to place towels on the couches to sit! Our saving grace was family staying at the Mandalay Bay. We spent most of our time there.
A mature established rock & roll themed casino resort dubbed from the world famous Hard Rock Cafe.  They have displays of various musicians instruments, costumes and clothing they wore during iconic concerts and music videos.  Examples like Slash's guitar and Brian Setzer's guitar from the Stray Cats times.  Gwen Stafani's red leather ska pants & no doubt wifebeater.  Princes Purple Rain leather jumpsuit get up etc. etc.  . . The amenities include cheesy trendy named restaurants with decent dishes.  Nobu is an awesome $$$$ sushi joint.  Culinary Drop Out serves the usual hipster tapa menu array.  The HRH pool includes a beach type setting with sandy areas and bars abound with probably one of the original LV dayclubs Rehab.   .   . .  It's just off the strip, but walkable, and close enough to some really cool local bars like the Double Down Saloon and the infamous "Fruit Loop" LGBT community.. . Came here for a little local vacay with my girl.  We had a very swank suite that had modern furnishings a separated lounge area and an upscale bathroom.   Great view of the pool.  After partying at the punkrock bar DD down the street we ordered room service that night.  It was a shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, fillet mignon for the main, chocolate strawberries for dessert & 2 cocktails.  All were decent about 4/5 for room service standards.   The servers were quick and non intrusive. . . Overall it was a great time at the HRH!
Honestly I wish this hotel experience could have been better. The front desk wasn't as rude as people said they were, in my experience they were really helpful actually. But that's where it ends. We checked in on a WEDNESDAY they said our room wasn't ready yet so I said it was fine and gave my phone number and they would call when it was ready. So after 3 HOURS of waiting in the hotel lobby's I went to the desk and asked if my room was ready thinking that they must have made a mistake with my phone number, unfortunately it still wasn't ready. So I waited another hour and asked again, when the Asian lady helped me again she saw how long I waited and offered me a room on the 3rd floor. Because my original room on the 16th floor wasn't cleaned yet and the cleaning crew is barely on the 5th floor. So I thought about it and realized if I was going to wait I would be in my room by midnight. So my wife was disappointed because we didn't have a view but we were tired after a 6 hour car ride. When we got into our room we were surprised that this room has been "cleaned" there was shrimp tails on the floor and the bathroom smelled terrible. The bed was comfy but smelled terrible like the staff never changed the sheets or pillows. Honestly the whole bed smelled like body odor and sweat. We had to contact the front desk about this problem and it took them around 1. Hr to send someone to fix it. And on top of that the shower smelled terrible like the water coming out of the shower smelled bad. Not to add to the fact that there was semen stains the glass walls of the shower. Honestly they said the paradise tower was beautiful but it was so dark in there I don't see how that is considered paradise.
If had the chance to stay in your car or Hard Rock Hotel stay in your car.  Wifi didn't work, safe didn't work, front disk and . Manager  extremely unprofessional.  When I called to complain she was trying to make a believe that with removing resort fee everything will be Better. I won't be back to this establishment ever again.  Not even for free.
As a frequent traveler to Vegas, this is my favorite place to stay. The Center Bar is always a good time and allows you get your drinks faster and more often when gambling. Rehab Pool Party is a must and highly recommend staying at Hard Rock Sunday Night.  Mr. Luckys and Pink Taco always have good service and awesome food. And if you like to gamble, the rewards card, Backstage Pass, is much better there compared to M Life rewards.. . FYI: If there is more than 3 people just spend the extra for a suite in the HRH Tower...it will be worth it with the 2 Queen Beds, and Nice Sofa (that may pull out) split by 2 French Doors with a pair of 2 Flat Screens.
Pretty disappointed with the hotel. We checked in on a Monday. I guess we were in the main section of the hotel, on the 11th floor facing the pool. We headed out pretty much immediately. Came back to the hotel around 9 and our room was extremely hot. We thought we just had the air on the wrong setting, so we fixed it and headed out again. Got back at 4 am and our hotel room was around 80 degrees, so we called maintenance. They responded right away, checked out our unit, and said the air was working properly. At 6 am, all four of us woke up, miserable. We went to the front desk to change rooms but were told every room was full. Our only option was to switch to an upgraded room the next day in the HRH tower, but we would have to pay for the upgrade. They refunded the day fee ($24) and we switched rooms the next day at 11. The new room was improved but I still find it unacceptable that we had to pay a $80/day upgrade when their room was the one with the issues. If they didn't have an equal room with a working air conditioner, we should have been upgraded free of charge. While we were able to salvage the trip, I will never stay here again!
My only complaint, but it ruined my sleep there is at 4am, deep into sleep I heard a buzz go off. So I had to find out what it was. . . Turns out, it was one of their cordless phones in my room. Something I would never use. Apparently, staff unplugged the phone charger. When the battery in the phone died, it starts buzzing. . . Ruined my sleep. I could had stayed at motel 6 and had a better night sleep. . . I complained to the management but they did no compensation for me at all but say they will alert the staff about what happened. . . Not a happy camper.
Just completed a two night stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas and left dissatisfied. Our room was clean and spacious but there were a few lights in our room that were not working. We were a group of three girls and I must say that it was difficult to get ready for the day/night because all of the mirrors were in one corner of the room. AWKWARD!. . The decor was pretty cute, the beds were amazing/very comfortable, shower was heavenly, and all of the staff we encountered was pleasant. I will say that the only reason decided to  book at the HRH is because we were told that we get up to four complimentary tickets to Rehab; upon check-in we quickly learned that is not the case! They will only give you rehab tickets at a discounted rate but($28 for the first 2 and $33 or $35 for the third and fourth tickets) it totally isn't worth it if you are a girl because you can pretty much get into ANY pool party for free by getting on the guest list.. . As far as the actual hotel lobby/casino..I really like how they have the actual outfits that musical artists have worn during some of their most popular performances. It was very cool to see..and the excitement stopped there for me.
Horrible service for a horrible stay. Teens everywhere constantly screaming, bottled water costs is 3000% beyond reasonable, and rooms are mediocre. Stay someplace else to avoid the pain.
With all the great hotels in Vegas, I would never stay here again. I stayed with my husband for 4 nights and will be my first and last time. We stayed in the HRH tower. . . Pros: Cool costumes worn by famous people, pools are awesome and bed are very comfortable. Make sure you stop and buy drinks, I bought a bottle of water in the room for $9.00. No bratty kids running around, well, actually you had drunk, loud, and rowdy young people running around. There was always some kind of drama in the elevator or in the hallways. . . Cons: Room was kind of dirty, even after housekeeping came in, they didn't do a very good job with cleaning. They might have had a toiletry shortage because we only got them the first night. Restaurants were very pricey. I hated the lighting in the room, the only normal light was in the washroom minus toilet room. I didn't like how the doors to the washroom were clear. The only privacy you have is in the tiny toilet room and it was moldy and dark. The  last day of our stay, housekeeping came in at 9:00 a.m., she knocked lightly and I was in the shower, keep in mind that those doors are clear. I let out a huge scream and my husband told her our check out was at 11 a.m. and to come back later. The resort fee is 22 plus tax, which equaled out to 25.86 per day. Ridiculous.
A true comedy of errors. First, our RESERVED room in the HRH tower was magically "downgraded" to a room in the casino tower. Next, due to the casino tower selling out (EDC weekend), we were then sent to the paradise tower and told the " upgrade" would be free. We did not receive housekeeping services for 3 days, which is pretty gross when the trash is full and you have wet towels.. Upon check out, I recieved a "bill" for nearly $800. ( I was an invited guest and comped!) I was told I had to now pay for the room due to demand over the time I was there!? I was then sent to VIP services where I showed the email whereI was to be comped. They said sorry and refunded $50 of my resort fees.. This hotel is so disorganized, stay somewhere else.
