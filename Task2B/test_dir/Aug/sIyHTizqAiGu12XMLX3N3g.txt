This does not need any more reviews...but, just in case someone doesn't know about this and it shows up on their feed - you need to go to this buffet. . . I came here 4 years ago, before they renovated it. It was probably as bad as going to Golden Coral or Ruby's. It just wasn't good, very poor quality and very overpriced. . I decided I would never go again.. . One thing I will tell you - I am not big on buffets. I don't like that people can touch the same things you're touching and you don't know where people have placed their hands. I eat out a lot and I can handle it with the restaurant employees because I don't see them making my food. At buffets, I see everyone touching everything or even putting their hands in something. I can't handle it. . . The #1 thing about this buffet is, almost everything is separated or served to you. High. Five.. #2 - the food is VERY good. I would say that this is the best buffet on the strip. I've been to most of them on the strip because when families come to town, they love buffets. This one trumps all. . The food is very well cooked, not over cooked and served very fresh. I love how they serve hot crab legs to you so they're not dried out or too cold. . I had the pizza, lamb, blue cheese wedge salad, Asian BBQ Ribs, Prime Rib, mac & cheese, green beans, chicken florentine, crab legs, crab wontons, I ate a lot. . But, my favorite was the crepes. I'm not big on sweets, but I looooooooove crepes. . I had her drizzle nutela on it and topped it with whipped cream, strawberries and caramel bananas...god, it was delicious.. . The buffet is pricey, but if you're going to indulge, it's worth it. It's very clean and the service is very good.
Let me start by saying we are not big buffet fans, but on several visits to Vegas we have gone to buffets. So.... . Check-in- WFT would I check in early, go gamble for 30 mins and then get a call to come to the front of the line only to spend another 30 mins waiting for a seat???. . Service- yep it is a buffet., so no service right?? But no plates ?? Seriously??. . Food- actually the food was decent, good selection and good quality.. . Cost- stupid, as a total rewards platinum member I still have to pay $30 upgrade? What??? This after $99 credit? Give me a break.. . Huge fan of Caesars, but not this place.
great selection, amazing desserts, amazing variety - something for everyone so with a big group, we ended up here more often than not
Where do I begin this was so amazing. Things I highly recommend:. -the hot crab legs . -clam chowder with bacon. -scallops in the shell with spinach & Panko crumbs! Mmmm. -Alaskan cod served over some yummy mash something- so good. . -mushroom ricotta pizza . -polenta with beef cheek & much room-sooo good. . -cream cheese wontons!. -good sushi-pretty basic rolls but high quality & fresh . . -mexican style corn with mayo,chile & butter. . I had to stop to save room for dessert, but some things I wanted to try were stuffed baked potato & Mac n cheese. . Dessert:. -creme brulee- perfect!!!. -made-to-order crepe, I topped mine with bananas in caramel sauce, nutella & whip cream- so delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. -flan. . Oh & the atmosphere is beautiful!
Best Vegas buffet I have ever been to!      Everything was delicious. There was plenty of variety. It has the price tag to match, but if you have the opportunity to go, I highly reccomend. If you buy the 24hr Buffet of Buffets pass it is slightly less expensive. Seriously still dreaming about this place.
I heard from family friends that this buffet is the best in Vegas. The setting was nice with the seafood and dessert station in the front. The buffet is in a "zig zag" form starting from the seafood to mexican, italian, and lastly asian cuisines. The waitress was very kind and checked on us for refills. I love their peach iced tea! The best time to come here is for lunch (I think its 37 bucks). Was it worth it? Hell yeah. My top 3 items would be the bone-in ribeye, wagyu slider, shrimp dim sum. I wouldn't say I would come here often, but if you win 40 bucks in the casino then definitely congratulate yourself with the Bacchanal Buffet. . . Oh btw, I LOVE their desserts! Crepes made to order, cake pops, and PANDAN TIRAMISU....need i say more..
This was my first opportunity to eat at the Caesars. I was told it was ranked number one in the city of Las Vegas. the last bus fare of this caliber I tried was at the Wynn by Steven Wynn. I was thoroughly impressed with their standard of excellence in every dish. But I was curious to see was Caesar's Palace better?. . I arrived for brunch on a Sunday at around 10:30a.m.. The lines were not too long and I was seated within 15 minutes. The price of the buffet was 45 99. That included my endless mimosa. The decor was very contemporary and chic. As my hostess took me to where I would be seated, I was able to get a glimpse of all of the wonderful treats that we're in store for me.. . I first started at the meat section. I had the prime rib which was a great choice. Your other options were chicken New Mexico sausage, hot links, slab bacon if you prefer. The staff at the carving station were very friendly. My prime rib was medium just like I like it however it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The New Mexico chicken sausage was zesty in flavor but cold in touch. This was disappointing but it also was a telltale sign for what I had to expect for the rest of my visit.. . I also enjoyed chicken and waffles. They were in an individual basket. I think it was the best thing that I ate. The chicken was crispy and juicy. And the waffle was flaky very good. When I got to the seafood table, I tried the snow crab and a lobster bisque with corn over a biscuit. The lobster bisque taste great however the potato that was in it was under cooked. Disappointed. I enjoyed that all the snow crab was warmed if you wanted it warmed in front of you.. . My mimosas kept coming and the coffee was hot fresh and delicious. I ended my meal with a slice of Pizza and a side salad with mozzarella and tomatoes and mushrooms. Overall I enjoyed the food however, with the price that I paid I would expect that everything would be near perfect and it wasn't I was not impressed by anything they serve on the dessert menu either.
Though the food is good, we got here at 830, they close at 10 but are no longer taking anymore people. An hour and a half earlier than the actual closing time is absolutely ridiculous. Definitely points removed for that. If they wanted to close at 8:30, they should say they close at 8:30 not 10, false advertisement!!!
Overall i thought that this buffet was one of the best buffets that i have ever been to. They had many different variety of meats such as lamb and primb rib (which were cooked really well). I am usually very picky with slider but the one at this buffet was amazing. The ramen was decent and so were the crab legs. This buffet had a giant variety of many different types of food and they all hit a good level of satisfaction. Not a big fan of buffets but this one is an exception for me.
The buffet at Caesar Palace is kind of mediocre. I have heard raving reviews about the newly remodeled buffet and decided to try it out.. . Came here on Monday for their lunch buffet. The cost was 35.99 plus tax, which is typical of Vegas buffets. The selection of food was okay, but most of the food was lukewarm or dried out which is strange when the place was packed.  . . The layout of the buffet was also strange as it snakes around and people just stay near the front where the seafood and meats are. The lines for the meats and tacos were long and people blocked the food near there so the baked potatoes and other foods near the area were untouched.  . The prime rib and brisket were overly salty but compared to everything else, it was decent.. The seafood was also decent and but the selection wasn't that great.. . Our server was also never around so there was always a lack of drinks. . . Overall. It was mediocre at best. Expectations were not met
$53 for Sunday dinner. I've been wanting to eat here and my family finally took me on my birthday. The only thing worth talking about was the lamb. It was amazing. Everything else was mediocre. No ones been posting recent photos of the food and I think after it was dubbed the #1 buffet in Vegas, it let go of itself. What happened to the French macaroons, crazy gelato flavors, fresh honey from the honeycomb and all the other goodies ppl have been boasting about? I feel hella cheated. As for the the chefs, I feel bad for them. Some ppl just don't have common sense. Idk how many times the chefs have told ppl to stop eating on the line and to take the plates with the food they literally transferred onto their personal plate via their hands. Smh* ppl!
NEW FAVORITE BUFFET IN VEGAS! :D. . This one is apparently fairly new, but it has the most reviews for buffets on the strips. My friends got here before the rest of us did, and luckily was able to make a reservation. The wait until the reservation for a party of 7 was only a 1 hour gap. I like how they give you a time to actually come back rather than making you wait iN LINE like at some of the other buffets. We made it in time before their lunch ended, but I was so hungry I don't remember looking at how much the price was per person. I do remember we got bottomless mimosas included with our buffet though!!. . I would say you can break this buffet down into 5 sections: Asian Cuisine, Taco Bar, Meat, Seafood, and Desserts. The selection of food is amazing, and not only is it a large selection, but the way the dishes are cooked makes it different from your average buffet. The only thing that sucks is that there is actually a long line at some of the Stations, especially the Taco Bar and the Seafood section. Most people don't see it, but the Asian Cuisine section is off to the left past the Taco Bar :P. . Don't get me wrong, everything was good, but these are MUST GET Favorites:. -Taco Bar! Customize your own tacos and the chef cooks it on a stone grill in front of you. -Hot Steamed Crab legs (Asian Section). -Cold Crab legs (Seafood Section). -Oyster Shooters (Seafood Section). . I know I'm stopping here for a buffet next time in Vegas!
I have tried most of the known buffets in Vegas and I would rate this one #1 (for brunch) as of yesterday. First of all, you don't have to wait in a long line like all other places. You just go up to a kiosk, sign in and they text you when your table is ready. So I decided to play some electronic black jack at the bar near by drinking my bloody mary. Our table was ready within 30 minutes at one of the craziest hours. . . I started off at the Asian section and worked by way through every dish, not wanting to miss out on any. Then I realized I did it all wrong! Make sure you start at the seafood section and try their hot crab legs! AMAZING. They also have another section where the guy cuts the meat. Unfortunately, I was way too full to stuff more meat down my throat so I passed on that. They also have a little juice section. Make sure to try the guava and horchata. They were great because it wasn't too sweet.. . Finally, their desserts are mouthwatering good. I grabbed at least half of the selections they offered. All of them were so tasty, especially the mango pudding and chocolate chip cookie. I'm SO torn that I haven't tried this place before, but I'm definitely revisiting here on my next Vegas trip.
Just got back from Vegas from my bachelorette party! WOO HOO. On the last day, we came here starved and hungover  and with a mission to stuff ourself silly. Me and my girlfriends were trying to diet and look sexy throughout the whole weekend in Vegas. We though that it was time to treat ourselves out and ended up coming here.  This is the second time I've been here and I LOVE IT!!. . The steamed crab legs are amazing as they are not overly salted like the other cheap buffets. (they salt it so you that you can't eat too much of it). So many different types of desserts as well that there will be one thing that you can find to like.. They also had these cute little bottles of horchata and guava juice! CAN YOU SAY HELL YEA?!? TRY THESE. I literally brought like 3-4 bottles of these.. . . The only downside is there is a FOREVER LINE/WAIT to get those crab legs and another forever LINE/WAIT to get nice cuts of meat. Literally took me 30 to 40 minutes just to get those darn crab legs.
$36.99 for weekend lunch.. . EFFICIENT. A good way to describe this buffet. They have a waiting time ticket system. Go to the computers and enter in your party number. They spit out a receipt giving you a time range when to return for payment and seating (they will also send messages to your phone if you prefer that option) Walk around and gamble until your seating time.. . I can't say much for the hot food, as most buffets I gorge myself on seafood. The crab legs and claws were a point. As were the OYSTERS! I've never had such fresh and sweet oysters at a buffet before! . . Dessert was a bit lack luster for me. The creme brulee was disappointing as the consistency wasn't right, but the FLAN was delicious and made up for the custard craving. I give them points for having macaroons at their dessert bar, granted they weren't very good and many of them were rock hard. A lot of the girls in our party loved the chocolate covered strawberries as well.
Ok, well I wanted to like this place being that my father in law footed the bill but im going to be honest about this place its just another buffet. The only thing that is worth trying is the crab legs and the rib eye steaks here. The wait wasn't that bad we waited a total of twenty five minutes included putting our names down. Some of the things I tried at the buffet were:. . Sushi.....its alright kinda tastes and looks like packaged sushi from 7 eleven. Rib eye.... was good and tender. Lamb shanks....they were good but overcooked. Carne asada tacos.....never come to a $50 buffet for tacos you can go else where, but the tacos were ok.. crab leggs...where really good and they are unlimited too,so I guess thats good.. Brisket...overcooked and tasted terrible. fruit....some of it was overripe and was uneatable . desserts...were eh ok. . There was a line for the meat and the cook serving the meat was very rude to most of the customers, including myself. He asked me what choice of meat I wanted I told him and then he didn't repeat back what I wanted so I repeated it a second time to remind him and he then copped an attitude and said " I Heard you man you don't got to tell me twice" and I was like woah, this guy is pissed. He's probably policing the meat hoping that his attitude will only cause just a few people to return a second time. Screw him I came back about three times, after all this was a $53 dollar buffet wasn't going to let this go waste. . . The service was ok, the lady that served us brought our drinks and after that I pretty much had to flag her down ever now and then to get a new drink. Would I come back? nope, very disappointed the wicked spoon is much better and a lot cheaper than the buffet here, sorry guys its the price that makes you want to like this place and not the food.
Amazing buffet!! Has anything  you could ask for!! Very polite staff!! Definitely will return!
the service was a 5, but i would give it 3 stars because of the food.. most of the cooked food was on the salty side & there aren't many vegetarian/vegan options.. also, the labels for the foods left out were incorrectly placed.
If I can give 0 star,  i would. Last year was terrible and this year is worst. We went on Aug 4 for dinner, party of 7. Prime rib was like rubber, lamb also like rubber. Green tea creme brulee was terrible and  no other dessert worth eating. Expensive as heck, over $50. I don't even know why i even try again. Spend your money at Bellagio Buffet. Cheaper and prime rib is very tender. I am a platinum member of Total Rewards. Anyway, not ever again I guess. I hope I remember next time.
Just WOW and not in a good way . . My family of 14 went to Vegas for a few days to take a little vacation before school starts and we ended up getting the 24-hour pass which we used here (but you also have to pay an upgrade fee of $30 for dinner per person). It made sense when we looked at all the pictures on yelp: king crab legs cut in half, crab cakes, korean bbq, peking duck, etc but we got there NOTHING. It was the bare minimum and it didn't even taste all that great. . . I guess it depends on what day you go but I wish I knew that before we forked over so much money for something we could have gotten at Rio or Planet Hollywood. All of us were 100% disappointed. . . The only thing that was okay was that the service was fast when clearing out plates.
This place is by far my favorite place to pig out. It's pretty pricey but I feel it is worth it. Service is great. Food is not the best, but better than majority of the buffets on the strip. There are a lot of options to choose from many different type of regions. I just wished they had some Mediterranean food. Tables and chair are comfortable to sit on. Some are even more plush than others. . Sometimes the seafood line merges with the carvery line which sometimes causes confusion. I see people wanting seafood  waiting in the very back of the line for carvery station. I got called out by someone for going into the seafood line and they wanted me to wait in the back of the carvery line, no one cared that I went into the seafood line, just that one person. After the altercation quite of few people who was at the carvery line just started to line up behind me because they wanted seafood, I guess. . I love their new system of getting into the buffet. They have a kiosk where you sign in to get a ticket telling you when you can come back to the buffet. It's a pretty smart idea, you can kill time by gambling, drinking, or whatever before your check-in window, instead of waiting in line for hours to get seated. Just don't forget to bring that ticket with you.. . I would recommend coming here if you want to pig out and spend a lot of cash.
You know a place is poppin' when you have to wait 2+ hours to get in. But all good, cuz the homie hooked it up with that VIP Status (aka he gamble a lot) so we got in real quick. I'm talking Quickbooks son!. . I heard Cesar himself ate at this place (My Mexican homie) and even he said "Me encanta!". . When in Rome, do as the Romans do, and man do the Romans know how to eat son!. . Let me break it down for you guys to make this review easier to read.. . ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN: . Ain't nobody trying to eat at a basic ass sit down buffet. This place is architecturally sound! Glass everywhere. Those good old architecturally sound Roman arches (go learn something and Google it) are made of glass! But it's sparkling glass, the type that glistens when lights hit it, kinda like vampires from Twilight. Not that I watch Twilight, just saying. . Lay out is pretty awesome too. All foods are separated by segregation. That's right, racism is even alive in food! Asian food towards the rear of the buffet, crackers and deli in the middle, BBQ in the front! Damn right! BBQ deserves to be in the front! Even vegans know!. . FOOD: . Let's get to it! AWEEEESOMMMEE. Brisket and the ribs are good enough to bring PEACE on Mother Earth. They got lamb, chicken, turkey, pork, beef, combine em all and you get LA CHUPA fawking CABRA! Who else you know got LA CHUPA CABRA!?? Even the people serving the food are happy. That's the key, you want people creating your food to be happy as Pharrell, that way you taste the love. Not in a weird way though. You know what I mean! Seafood is everywhere, you want your crab legs? you get your damn crab legs and some! . They have ramen soup, though I'm not a big fan or Ramen soup, other people are. Crackers, deli meat and cheese --- DOOO NOT SLEEP ON THIS! I'm talking these are 5-star caliber Lunchables people! Another thing to not sleep on are the Horchata, Guava, and Strawberry drinks they keep in a glass. If you ever have a bad day, one drink of either of those and you taste the meaning of life --- ENJOYMENT BABY! Did I mention there are UNLIMITED mimosas! Mama say, mama say MI-MA-MOSA! (Ode to MJ). I know ya'll Vegas peeps love you some mimosas. I see ya'll on Instagram hashtagging the shit out of it #MIMOSA. . . DESSERT:. Where do you start? Gelato, Ice cream, so much cake, it's ridiculous. The downside of the awesome buffet is you probably won't have enough space for dessert. Of course, they also have fruit, but if you're like me you go straight for the MEAT anyway.. . If you have the moola and time to spare, or you have a homie in the VIP (brazzers), then try this place out. You won't regret it!
This has got to be my favorite buffet in Las Vegas. They have over 500 items to choose from several culinary backgrounds such as American, Mexican, Asian, Japanese, Italian, BBQ and my favorite Seafood! The line for this buffet is very long, thanks to our high roller in our party, we got the expedited line. If you time it right, you can pay lunch price and get all the dinner entrees. We came around 230 pm so we still paid $38 for the lunch price, so by the time we were seated we got to try the end of lunch entrees and the new dinner entrees coming out. . . The King crab legs are served over ice and are sweet and tasty. Fresh Oysters on a half shell were delicious especially topped with the vinegar sauce. The cooked shrimp were humongous! Prime rib was excellent, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The lamb chops had a really great flavor but over cooked for my taste. There are also many different varieties of desserts. My favorites were the green tea cream brulee, carrot cake and lava cake. Definitely come hungry so you can try all the different yummy varieties of food.
Horrible buffet. We went at 5 pm on a Sunday hoping to avoid a long line. We printed a ticket from the kiosk and had a 1 hour wait. . . Once seated it took about 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order. Both of my kids ordered Dr Pepper. The server came back and said they don't have Dr Pepper and he brought root beer instead. . . Food selection isn't anything special. Very very long lines for each good station. I ate at the planet hollywood buffet last week and the crab legs there were much better quality. Nothing we ate was memorable. I don't feel like the selection was bigger than other strip buffets.. . Service was awful. Our server never cleaned up our dirty plates and never refilled our drinks. Tables are very small and we were very cramped with all the dirty plates.. . The dessert section had no plates so I had to go search some out. The desserts looked good, but lacked in taste. The macaroons had a jelly filling and I spit it out it was so bad. The ice cream melted before I got back to my table. The coconut macaroons felt like dough flavored with fake coconut. I tried several other desserts and nothing was good. I like to have a cup of coffee with my desserts at buffets but since our server was MIA I couldn't even ask for one.. . Very disappointed. Don't waste your time or money on this buffet.
Our favorite buffet in Vegas. Always a wait but they do have those handy dandy kiosk that you can sign in to and they'll text you when you're at the front of the line so at least I can wander off around the casino. I throw caution to the wind when I'm here and forget about logging my daily caloric intake on myfitnesspal because inevitably we end up sitting around for 2 hours and I've eaten more than is reasonably safe. Anyhow, I think I've sampled a bit of everything here and everything is pretty good but the only area I care about is the seafood - which means shrimp, crab legs, oysters until I'm full. Only downside is everyone probably thinks just like me so the line at the seafood bar is quite long and it becomes sort of a pain to go through the line each time - but I guess it gives me time to digest the food while I wait. Their dessert bar is decent - although I only go for the chocolate covered strawberries, crepes, and mochi ice cream - everything else is standard.
I would say that this place is impressive but then I'd be lying, the servers and hosts were very rude, we made reservations for 11:45 am and were told when we arrived that they don't take reservations and then we were  told they do, then they told us you we would be texted when your tables were ready, an hour  and a half go by,  and still no text, so then we go up and ask what's going on and we are told that we cannot sit together and that if we wanted tables together it was going to be an 18 % gratuity in addition to  the already 600$ bill for breakfast, being that we were a party of 11 that would normally make sense but being that this is a BUFFET,  we were not having it, when a manager finally came she was rude and unapologetic, and seemed to roll her eyes and just generally was very unprofessional, she told us basically she can't do anything, then rudely said I will get the general manager and he can explain it to you the same way I did and maybe you'll understand. Another  thing the subordinate manager said later on that was rude was when she had us being taken to our seats  she told the host to make sure she split us up,even after all the hassle of simply letting us sit together , so the general manager comes out and before he did they were telling us that even if we split up into two groups we'd still be charged gratuity and the tables wouldn't be close, finally we get sat and and the general manager was able to take off the gratuity and we got two tables and they were semi close. The food was great until a few hours later when my stomach was unsettled and I threw my 600$ meal up. Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional.
THE BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP (perhaps in Vegas?) BAR NONE!. . I remember going to the Caesar's buffet when it was a few heating lamps and steam tables.  Certainly nothing to clamor about and the food was bleah.  Not anymore!  Bacchanal has turned Caesar's table for the better.. . We went on Thursday for a late lunch as we were flying back home later that evening.  Very short queue for a line and then when we were seated it was right in front of the dessert bar.  Bad idea on their part, great for us!  . . Their buffet had everything.  Stone crab claws, oysters onthe half, HUGE cocktail shrimp, street tacos, prime rib, brisket cooked for 18 hours, pasta and pizzas, sushi and dim sum...and that's just to name a few things!  . . Their seats were cushy and comfortable, and the buffet line seemed to go on and on and on.  Their cooking staff is also great, personable and had great customer service.  . . For desserts, they had a crepe chef, shaved ice (delicious house/custom flavors) and gelato as well as various cupcakes, cheese cakes and other small plates of incredible gastronomy.  . . While Bacchanal is pricier than most other buffets on the Strip, you literally get what you pay for.  If you're big on buffets and really know how to eat at a buffet, the costs are nominal.  I made my money's worth on prime rib and oysters alone!. . I hesitate giving them such a high rating as it will just make lines even longer, but they certainly deserve it.  . . I would probably ding them for not serving Coke (the serve Pepsi), but they more than made up for it with their fresh juices (the mango is to die for!!!).
This is definitely the best buffet in Vegas, however the wait is extremely long. They have a great selection of carved meats, seafood, Italian food, Asian food and even 'sushi'. Their Sunday brunch buffet is great.  I highly recommend their gravlax/smoked salmon, any of their carved meats, the ceviche (absolutely amazing) and the crab legs. And the best thing about the Sunday brunch was unlimited mimosas (however, I only got two as our server did not check on us very often).
Really great variety of food. Strangely arrange though. The lines for the meat options (brisket, rack of lamb, prime rib) and for the seafood (mostly shrimp and crab legs) were really long and interrupted the flow of the other food stands. It was also difficult to find plates while already in said lines. A few times my friends would have to exit the lines when they were near the front since the plates were at different locations. Service was excellent though! We requested several refills and our waitress was always prompt and sweet. I liked the dim sum options- nothing strange or exquisite. It was what you'd normally order at dim sum restaurants like Ocean star. I also liked that the chef had offered to boil my crab legs too. My favorite was the prime rib and Mac n cheese. . We prepaid with premium seating so we only waited a maximum of 15 minutes to find seating.
So we went to check out bacchanal buffet after hearing all the hype about it. We waiting about 1 hours in line. Once we got seated our server came and took our drink orders and ask if we wanted some wine . Service was great. Lets talk about the food now... Nothing there made me say "wow I have to come back to eat this again" Presentation of the food was nice. But once you took a bite of your food most of it lack flavor or had something missing. The food did not wow me.  I will not be returning.
I wasn't sure what to expect, because based on reviews, people either love this place or hate it.  My husband and I took a quick trip to getaway, and this was to be our special meal after seeing it on an episode of Brew Dogs. . . We decided to do lunch instead of dinner - it was $34.99 per person for lunch, and the wait was shorter.. . The place is decorated nicely for a buffet.  Probably one of the better ones I've been too.. . The food was spectacular.  I can say hands down that this is the best buffet that I've ever eaten at.  Neither my husband and I eat seafood but they have quite a large selection of that, and you could easily eat your monies worth in sushi alone.. . I had several helpings of the yellow curry.  It had excellent flavor - some of the best curry that I've eaten to date.  My only complaint is that there was not any rice available to eat with it. . . I also really loved the macaroni and cheese.  It had a really nice smoky flavor. Not your average cheese and noodles.  I was also a fan of the brisket sliders.. . My husband really liked the prime rib and the giant slab of bacon.. . For dessert they had a good selection that looked as amazing as it tasted.  We both loved the apple pie with the crumb topping.  It was the best apple pie I've ever had (don't tell mom).  There was an Oreo Mousse that I'm wishing for more of right now, an excellent carrot cake, mango pudding, and a chocolate raspberry torte.  . . I have to see this was one of my favorite meals in Vegas, and I intend to eat here again.
Poorly organized for a buffet.  People lined up like cattle in one long line for prime rib and seafood ie crab legs.  Food ok not awesome; question the $51 price.
$55 brunch Sunday . . The line was ridiculous, it stretched into the casino. Luckily my friend was a diamond status member so we walked up to the front.. . $55 a person is a little high for me. Bellagio is actually cheaper and has more selection. The $55 includes bottomless champagne or mimosa. If you don't drink this, then it's probably not worth paying the $55.. . Salad Bar-small and boring, but who the hell eats salad if you pay that much. . Asian foods-I have to say we're horrible. No line for the Asian hot foods, and it tasted like Panda Express.. . Sushi-small selection, but made fresh. Don't expect much from sushi at this place.. . Italian/anti pasta- awesome. Lots of selection and everything was made fresh. The quality was in the taste.. . Mexican-a taco bar (who eats tacos at a $55 Buffett) I day skip the Mexican food and get your money's worth. But taste was ahhhhhh ok. . Soul food-surprised to see soul food and BBQ but it was good. Everything also fresh and a lot of southern dishes you don't normally see in restaurants.. . French cuisine-line was to long to get this, but kind of a small selection blah.. . American-this area was the longest line, turkey, prime rib, ribs, filet minion. Of course I was a fat ass and had all of it, and was well worth the wait. Amazing selections.. . Seafood-the best area. Crab, lobster bisque, shrimp galore, fried fish, and everything you can think of, but no lobster tail. For $55 this was the biggest disappointment. Bellagio and Rio has lobster cuisines including lobster tail for cheaper.. . Dessert-selection was amazing. So much to choose from. Definitely make room for dessert. So much high end selections here as well especially if you like chocolates or sweets. I went to town on the desserts.. . I would go back again but not for brunch. Dinner serves the shames selection for cheaper which is why I say it's only worth it if you drink champagne. Outside of brunch I would go back  for the selections they have, but I gave this place a 3 star because of the wait, and the price.
Food is very good.  It's the price I have issues with.  $51 per person for dinner?  Is that the way it's going to go?  Really?  I thought $40 was high end.  This place is just not worth $51 for one buffet.
Hands down the best buffet in Vegas, it's nearly impossible to try everything because of their huge selection. . . It was like heaven in my mouth, my favorite foods were the pesto clams and oysters in some zesty sauce. . . The crab legs are excellent quality and the dessert bar is magical. . . This place is a must.
They had warm snow crab legs, which was different cuz it's usually cold. I prefer the cold crab legs because they're sweeter. They had macaroons for dessert which was a bonus. Their udon tastes like regular udon broth. They had a lot of oysters and different toppings for the oysters like horseradish. Most places don't give that. I liked their tamarin juice drink. It was a little sour.
Best buffet in Vegas as of August 2014. . . Asian section is kind of tucked away in the back but once you find it there's sushi,  noodle soups in different varieties,  dim sum and other yummy dishes.  . Meat section, as I called it but I think properly it was the American section,  served a carving station with all the meat you could ask for,  tons of potato dishes (my fave was the truffled potatoes), even a quinoa dish, although it didn't taste particularly healthy.. . Bottomless Mimosas were great but dangerous. . . Tips. * Stay awhile and enjoy dessert too. Green tea creme brulee was awesome!. * Asian section is in the back (#minoritycorner). * Truffled potatoes = must try. * Stop by the noodle station
Like most places in Vegas, this buffet is overrated. After reading the reviews here, my girlfriend and I were so excited to try what most people call the best buffet in Vegas. . . I recommend that you go to this buffet a little before 3 pm. This way the line is very short, you pay the lunch price rather than the dinner price, and you can eat dinner items because they will be serving it starting at 3 pm. . . The service sucked (see below). The food was just okay. Not crappy, but not great if you are paying $50 a person. I'll go in order:. . The salad ingredients were fresh, but that's not hard. Their "cheese" menu was severely lacking -- there were only 3 kinds of cheese, and they were all extra sharp. The soups were cold because most people want to make their money by focusing on the expensive meats, so the soups just sit there and hardly anyone eats them -- I love clam chowder, but theirs was cold and lumpy. I asked them if they could warm it up and they said it was a fresh batch. (It wasn't a fresh batch.). . The Asian ramen stand is good, and although I don't usually like tofu, theirs was really good. However, you can get a lot of good ramen from asian restaurants for a lot less money (and you should probably avoid ramen at buffets because it is so filling). . . My favorite item was the creamy salmon, but none of the sides were good, so eating just salmon was boring. The crab was a little too salty. The prime rib only comes in medium rare -- disgusting. The "lobster" corn chowder barely had any lobster, and in any case was not very good.. . I didn't try the taco station because I live in San Diego, home of the best tacos in the country. But people kept lining up for them, so maybe they are worth a try.. . The dessert was lacking as well. The gelato section looks interesting, but there is a line for it, and they only give you one little scoop per visit. I had to wait in line three times to try 3 flavors. They all tasted like frozen yogurt, and not the good kind. The cheesecake only came in sugar-free form. (What?). . All we wanted for drinks were hot tea, but they don't have tea pots. Instead, they use their coffee pots and just add water to them. So the tea just tastes like old coffee. We kept asking the server if they could wash them out and she said all she can do is add water. The tea was just horrible because it just tasted like bad coffee.. . They make sure the most filling items are well stocked, so people get full faster at a lower cost to them. We've definitely been to better buffets that cost much less.
I try to go to at least one Vegas buffet a year...and I am continually disappointed. I came her during lunch it was earlier in the day so it wasn't too crowded. The food was mediocre. . The sushi selection was not really a selection. It looked rather sad actually only 4 choices of rolls and no sashimi. The dim sum selection was quite large however the shumai is the only thing worth getting. . The seafood selection was not an actual selection. The crab claws hardly had any meat and the oyster shooters were super salty.. . Overall the desserts are the reason why I gave this place two stars. The pan dan tiramisu and the red velvet whoopie pie were my favorite.
It's hard to rate a buffet because it's really all about the items YOU choose. And here, there are soooo many to choose from, I am sure 100 people will have 100 completely different experiences based on what they choose to eat.. . This buffet is massive and good quality for a buffet, so if you can't find something you like, you are probably just in a bad mood or a true buffet hater, and then you shoulda stayed home.. . Service for us was spotty, thus not 5 stars. We stopped seeing our waitress after the first two orange juices and though we didn't stay long, plates did stay in the middle of our table with no pick-up.. . We went for lunch. I'll give you an idea of what you can expect here at the various stations:. --Fresh cold and cooked seafood items, including crab and shrimp. I tried the corn lobster soup and it was super salty and some baked cod that I didn't like, so my impression here was not great. But lots of folks just piled plates high with in-shell crab and had at it, so I'm guessing that was a hit.. --Italian station. Pastas and pizzas. I didn't try anything here but my daughter thought the pizza was delicious.. --Salad station. I am a salad lover, so I was sad to see that nothing in this section looked appealing to me.. --Indian food. --Sushi. YES! The salmon and hamachi nigiri were small but quite good. There were also some sushi rolls that were OK.. --Chinese. Didn't try any, but decent selection and some dim sum items.. --American station with the carved meats, sliders, baked potatoes, etc. This was one of the more crowded stations, but I'll admit I tried none of it.. --Mexican station: Living in the Portland area where Mexican food generally sucks, I loved this section! Someone was there to grill up mini tacos for you and there were mini tostadas and green chili verde, and more. Between this and the sushi station, I was happy.. --Desserts: You know when you go into a Whole Foods and the bakery has all those mini desserts that look so good but cost like $4-5 each? So you pick your favorite and go home? Well imagine that you've paid this $36 entrance fee, and now you can literally try as many as you want! I took a bite of about 7 of them. Nothing really stood out to me, but I have the same experience at Whole Foods. More eye candy than anything. For dessert fiends though, you could have your whole meal at this station. There is a LOT to choose from, including all the mini desserts and some gelato and a crepe station.
I gotta say. Bacchanal Buffet is one of the top buffet in Vegas. If you go Vegas without stopping by Bacchanal, then it is one of the big lost that you have.. . The foods here are good and have more variety , especially the desserts. One of  my favorite dessert that you cannot find where else at the buffet is Macaroons. All you can eat Macaroons. . . Make your money worth while you are in Vegas
Bacchanal is a good example of how a place can be really good and still overrated.  I felt like there was a lot of hype for this place, and all the anticipation gave me ridiculously high expectations, it's heavily oversold and I bought in.  Ultimately, I am giving it 4 stars because I really did liked the food and they have tremendous variety, but the service wasn't very good.. . Like all the great buffets, they have many different stations, but the crown jewel is the carving station.  They have A LOT of meats: prime rib, ham, different kinds of sausage, brisket, lamb chops, ribs... and I'm sure I'm forgetting some, I didn't try all of them, but I tried a lot of them and they range from very good to great, the lamb chops being my favorite.  Other standouts were the dumplings, cheese station, crab legs, cake pops, and little jars of agua fresca.  The dessert station is surprisingly hit or miss.. . I recommend trying to get your money's worth because it certainly ain't cheap, especially if you pay the extra $20 to stand in the 30min VIP line to bypass the peons in the 2hr line.  Our waitress was friendly, but hard to get a hold of, so much so that after waiting quite a while to get a refill, I told her to please bring me 2 drinks when she finally came around.. . Bacchanal is a great buffet, easily in my top 5 buffets, but Wicked Spoon and the Aria Buffet both rank higher in that list.
I haven't been to this buffet since it opened but it was the best I ever tasted.  It was better than Bellagio and I've been there several times.  As a person that use to live in Vegas, I know my buffets and this one is the best.  I hope to go to this one on our next trip!
Literally fell in love the moment I had my first bite of the seafood offered here lol. Man it's so upscale and quality when it comes to food here. The price is definitely worth paying for when eating here seriously. I used to be so in love with the M buffet but now differ.
What's all the buzz ?! We simply thought this place was okay.The wow factor for us was simply the variety of food offered and nothing we ate knocked our socks off ..... I will say the dim sum was pretty good ..as good as the spots we have here in the bay area but that was it.
Best best buffet in Las Vegas. The food was great sooo good. There's a a lot of food stations also an ice cram station loved it. Haven't been to buffet like this .
Rated as the best buffet in the nation, we had to give this a try and had certain expectations. Sadly, we found this place overrated.. . The free-flowing champagne was a huge plus, their dessert bar was aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable, and my favorite item were the red velvet pancakes!. . The rest of the food wasn't too memorable, and overall tasted bland. It was still an incredibly fun atmosphere and and we enjoyed having brunch here at Bacchanal Buffet. Do check it out and enjoy the experience.
Every visit to Vegas must include this buffet. Lunch or dinner, expect to surprise yourself with 2 hours of gourmet food and drink. Our lunch included bottomless mimosa's which was a nice touch. Went a second time for dinner and was also very satisfied. Line can get long (1hr wait or so), so go during off-peak hours.. . Beware of requesting a small plate of crab legs though; they will ignore your request and pile on about 15-20 legs.
New waiting system, you first come in and get ticket they will tell you the wait time, you can come back when your table it's almost ready. They should do this for all the buffet at Vegas. :) (wait it's less than 20min. After you come back from the time they text you). . Over all food quality it's one of the best I would say, great quality for the price and many selection. Fresh sea food, king crab leg, oyster. Very good prime ribs, and they got the bomb chicken soup. . . Love the trendy decor, try to get the seat next to the window by the pool, it's really nice, great with groups of friend. . . Definitely the buffet of Vegas, I would come back every time cus their wait it's a lot shorter now.
It's basically not worth the long waiting. It took me almost 90 min to get a table. The quality of food is less than average.
It is pretty much as good as everyone says it is.  The food choices are incredible.  Like, literally my plate was full after I looked at just 1/4 of the food (not including the desserts).  Some of my favorites were the sweet potato tater tots, chips and guacamole, mashed potatoes and gravy and baked beans.  They had really cool stations that I had never seen at another buffet before, such as artisanal cheese.  I would definitely come back because the food was good and there were a TON of options so if you have a party that has picky eaters, they will likely find something up their alley.. . The hostess who sat us was also very nice.  When she found out that my sister had been to the buffet before and recommended that I come, she thanked my sister for returning and suggesting I visit.  They have to know that word of mouth marketing is really strong and you can tell that everyone takes their jobs very seriously.  They had more staff on hand (cleaning tables, setting tables, serving, preparing food) than any other buffet.  They are obviously spending a lot of wages, but the quality of that really comes through.  I even asked someone at the dessert station about desserts without nuts and she didn't know she she checked with someone instead of just guessing (as happened to me at other buffets).  That follow up, even if simple, goes a long way with me.. . With that being said, the price was ridiculous.  it was $75 for two of us for lunch.  I know they have to charge that much because of the seafood and sushi, but as a girl with simple tastes, my dinner probably only cost them a couple dollars to make, at most.  Considering how shitty all the other buffets were, though, I would gladly spend more to be able to eat here.
This place is amazing. Everything was fresh! The seafood was fresh.  The meats were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The sides were great.  I live that you can check in then go walk around until it's ti.e for u to be seated, that just makes it so convenient.  Waitress was good she kept my champagne topped. Overall great experience
just ok.  would not go back for $50.  the yelpers giving5 stars do not know any better and are the Obama voters.
I have a couple of disclosures.  One i am a seven star member (that is the highest rated player).  Two i never pay for food at any of the caesars group hotels.. . I really liked the buffet.  The selection is huge.  The food is really good.  The desserts are incredible.  But what i liked most of all was every time i went to refill my plate, when i came back my plate was cleared and i had a fresh utensil set.. . I know i sit in a special section but this made my experience perfect.  I have eaten here several times and always had a great experience.
This is our second time in this buffet and I have to say I am not as impressed as I was the first time. . I understand I have to wait and I am ok with that and I love the system that you have. . . Got to the table got drinks right away but been sitting and eating for about an hour now and no one even stopped or asked if I want a refill. . . The table next to me, the people left about 45 minuets ago and no one came to clean the table and have it ready for the next couple ( is this the reason for the wait times ? And then you are charging $20 per person if they don't want to wait ? ) . . Food was great and I will sure to come back for the food but the service at the table is a joke and that is the reason for my 3 stars. . . Come in enjoy the food but ask from the get go an extra drink and be here 1/2 an hour to an hour early to get in at the time you want because while it took me about 8 min to write this review they still didn't clean the table next to me or picked upthe empty plates from our table since we got here.
The desserts... Deliciouuuusssss. And I am very particular about desserts. I don't like huge portions and sugar saturated foods.. . All the desserts I had here were flavorful and not too sweet. They were perfect. I devoured everything I got (see pix). Went to "The Buffet" at Wynn the next day; they are supposed to be known for sweets. It did not compare to what I had here.  . . I thought the crab here was not as good as Wynn's but my friend liked it better. They come out warm. My other friend said the oysters were better here. My friends liked the seafood. . . Other foods I liked: Lamb, corn, mashed potatoes. Friends liked their seafood and apparently they use really expensive meat in their sliders. . Drink: tea drinks were really good. not too sweet. . Servers- Excellent. Came around frequently taking away our plates and filling our drinks. Was there on a Friday around 530pm. . The reason for minus 1 star- The price. . . They had a wide variety of food. I think it was worth it.
This buffet is way over rated. Considering this is supposed to be the best buffet in town,  I found it a little average. . . The selections were plentiful but the wait times and the quality was subpar. Seriously there were so many people in line for the raw oysters,  shrimps,  and crab legs that my boyfriend ate 2 plates before I came back with just one. . . This place is a mad house on the weekends as well. One review said the chefs were friendly but they were so busy on Friday that no one bothered to look up from refilling their stations. The price also increases x2 on weekends and there are so many kids. . . The service was alright. The waitress cleared our tables in a timely manner and our refills kept coming. . . The dessert bar is also amazing. They have mini versions of everything. My favorite has to be the creme brulee and the flan.
Overrated. Funny part is when you're at the front of the line, about to enter - they actually have a photographer there who will take your picture (like you're at Disneyland) if you want.  . . There was nothing wrong with the buffet, but it was rather enlightening/disappointing when we had lunch at the Aria buffet the next day and they essentially had all the same things (and I'm talking about the good stuff - shrimp, cold and warm crab legs - in fact, their crab legs tasted even better than Baccahanal's).  And that was obviously way cheaper.  . . Well, now we know.  At least we can say we tried it once.
Had this for a second time and enjoyed it as much as my first.  If you're looking for sushi or may, go to wynn or bellagio. . Good:. Seafood quality. Huge assortment of food.. Dessert selection.. Decor. Service!. . Bad:. Pricing. Sushi. . Ok:. Meat. Asian food
shrimp, oysters and crab legs! Don't get anything else! Oh and really liked their juices-- horchata, jamica and guava
Can't wait to go back!!!  Bacchanal did not disappoint!  . . My recommendations.... Steamed Crab Legs. Beef Brisket (the BEST I've ever had). Sliders. Mac and Cheese. Truffled Potatoes. Baked Potato (had pulled pork in the middle!!). Crab Ragoons. Har Gao. Custard Buns. Sushi. Guava Juice, Mango Juice. Mango Pudding. Shave Ice. Fresh Crepes. White Chocolate Covered Strawberries. Strawberry Cheesecake Pop. Calamansi Pastry (can't remember the exact name). . Dislikes.... Spicy Fried Fish. Creme Brulee. Macarons. Passion Fruit Pudding. Lobster Bisque. . Didn't get to try the taco station and we forgot about the chicken and waffles.  Next visit for sure!!
$55 for dinner on a Monday. 5:20pm no wait. Dim sum, a bit bland. Xiu Mai pork wasn't very flavorful. Mediocre sushi selection. The nagiri was laughable. Oyster was fresh. Cold crab legs were well stocked.  Hot crab legs tasted good. Prime rib was good. Very dry looking chow mien and chow fun was bland. So basically ignore their crappy Asian selections. Burger sliders dry and over cooked. Mexican corn on the cob on point. Liked their mushroom risotto. "Fresh" Fruit is sour. Dessert is good. Liked the mango pudding and Nutella coffee ice cream. Lava cake dry. Flan was ok. Horchata watery. Pineapple juice good. Reviewed while I was eating.  6:50pm departure and a good amount of people in line. It's good compared to other buffets on the strip but I'm not sure it's worth $55 or a long wait.
Me and my boyfriend expected the wait to be extremely long but we went at 2:30 (after the lunch rush) this past Friday, and we were seated within 10 minutes! . . The selection was awesome, and we focused heavily on the fresh oysters and shrimp. The dessert area was amazing as well so save room! Crepes and shave ice made to order!. . It was about $77 for two, plus we tipped the staff that were fairly attentive in cleaning up our used plates. You definitely pay for the variety in food ranging from American to Mexican, Japanese, Chinese and more.
Sad to say I was a tad bit disappointed.. . In all fairness though, I was pretty hungover so it was hard for me to enjoy the food. Don't get me wrong - everything was decent but I think a lot of people hyped this place for me. I rarely go to buffets in Vegas but when I do, I go straight to the crab and shrimp. Typical asian, going for the expensive stuff. I started off at the very end which was the dim sum/asian side. Everything was good. I tried a bit of my friends things as well. Sushi looked weird. Prime Rib was bomb. The truffle cheese scalloped potatoes were BOMB. The crab was a bit salty but it was really good (and it was sliced in half for easy access *wink) The shrimp is always good and unfortunately I don't like the oysters but I hear they were good. . . I was pretty satisfied with the plain crepe with nutella for dessert but I wish I had gelato. My stomach just said NO MORE. . . I wouldn't mind coming back here. Endless mimosas.. how can I say no. For 60 bucks though, I think I would rather eat at the Wynn buffet for half the price
It was an interesting experience. Very crowded arrangements of seatings w barely ne walk ways to table. Most foods r very salty n dry. N their long single line arrangement of food stations cutting off to bk area  was like bing in some sort of maze.  Best i can remembr is the zucchini side dish. Aqua fresca in individual bottles were cute but cant say flavors were as good. Condiments r hard to reach or see. Fortunately i paid lunch price bfr starting of dinner n had no line to wait in.  If it was othrwise i would've been very unhappy. Oh! But Shrimp lovers u'd like their jumbo cocktail but crab legs r waaaaaaaay bettr at wynn! Barely ne meat to eat.
Whoaaaa maybe better than Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo!  My party of 8 were very lucky to get a spot for dinner.  They were sold out for dinner on Saturday night and we were on standby.  Only waited 15 minutes!  I think the lady felt sorry because I looked like a sad, starving puppy so she let us in, but split our group in two, which is fine with me!  They have great selections.  Fresh sushi and crab legs!  My favorite was the dessert bar! OMG the ice cream was mad good!! There is always a line here so come early!!
Have been here twice, first time was during weekday lunch, price are reasonable and food has lots to choose from! Oysters, hot dishes, dimsum, ramen, pizza, pasta, guacamole, tons of dessert. It's under 25/person! Food taste in general very delicious, I was very satisfied! Second time came on a Sunday. It was their Sunday brunch, unlimited champaign and mimosa, I am not a big drinker and I could do without it. The food is still very good, and added the crab leg. Crab leg is very fresh and tasty compare to other buffets I have been to in vegas. It was 50/person. . But I would prefer just to come during weekday.. I could do without the crab leg and mimosa.
The best ever. Crab legs, meat selection, cheeses, etc.... Whatever other buffets have just 20x better. It's just a little pricey but worth the money and wait time. Come early and get a fast pass ticket!
Ok, We already all know the food here is amazing, but has anyone mentioned the staff? . . Honestly, every time I go to a buffet in Vegas I feel like I am left on my own. Yes, I know that is the point, but where is my waiter half the time? Even then, I feel as if they are saying to themselves "Oh God, here is another round of people to stuff themselves". Bacchanal Buffet is different,  in so many ways. . . We came her after a very disappointing Saturday night delayed flight into Vegas for a Bachelorette party. We stayed up until 6am to make up for it.  We knew the wait would be long at Bacchanal, but just could not make it there until 12:30pm.. . The hostess Erma told us to go get a time card from the machine. It printed out with a time to come back (kind of like a fast pass at Disneyland) for 3:15pm. We were so sad because the bottomless mimosa's on Sunday only go to 3:00pm and we had a whole itinerary planed for our soon to be bride. I went up to Erma to ask her if there was anything to be done. Seeing how we had a Bachelorette who's face was covered in crushed dreams, she asked to see my ticket.. and then allowed us to go in!! Erma you are the best :) . . The wait was a bit long to get to our table but once there our waiter Jeff and busser Vladamir took great care of us. Jeff was amazing. He kept our mimosa's full, and even played games with us to see who had had the most to drink. We loved his humor, attention to detail, and the fact that he never let us see the bottom of our mimosa glasses ;). . We also met the manager Wolf. We actually met him when trying to find Bacchanal inside Caesars. He kindly showed us the way and mentioned he worked there. Later in our brunch he came over to our table and asked us how everything was. Upon remembering us we began joking. We ended up having a nice little banter between our server Jeff, Wolf and our table. . . Jeff even brought an assortment of deserts from the buffet with a candle in it for our Bachelorette to blow out in a celebratory congratulations! . . The food here is amazing to say the least, but the staff behind it all is equally as satisfying. I know this review seems to have a lot of info about the staff, but they truly made our experience so fun! I want to thank you for making my friends Bachelorette brunch so memorable!!  . . Seriously, ask for Erma, Jeff, Vladamir, and Wolf! They are amazing! . . Also.... get an many crabs legs as you can. They are super fresh!! :)
We came at 3:30 and we had missed the lunch buffet which ends at 3 pm. When we arrived, there wasn't that infamous line that Bacchanal is known for. We didn't have to use the kiosk as there was no line to get in. After paying $55 each, we were whisked away to have our picture taken. Hmm, I guess for some it may be a memento that they dined at one of Vegas' great buffets. . . I had high hopes of eating at this grandiose of a buffet. I'm sorry but our experience was just mediocre. There was no lobster tail, instead they offered steam snow crab legs. Bummer! I had some of the crab legs, basically the same crab legs I would find at any other buffet. I tried the lobster chowder, bland and cold. Hubby had a couple of slices of prime rib, just ok. The ribs were nothing to write home about. The lettuce wedge was bland as well. As a matter of fact, most of the food was quite bland and either cold or old?! The fried rice at the Chinese food section was dried out and looked unappetizing. After having so many misses with my food, I found that they had Tonkotsu ramen! Ugh! The noodles were mushy and overcooked. Matter of fact, nothing stood out in my memory as spectacular. It was just another buffet. . . After being there for an hour, I noticed that there were some people who really enjoyed this buffet. There was a group of about eight people and three of them were asleep in their chairs while others were getting endless plates of food. We could see that they got their money's worth because there was a mess of plates on their table. Seriously, if you are gonna take a nap, isn't it time to call it quits?? Go back to the hotel if you're gonna sleep, people! . . Anyway, Bacchanal failed to impress me, it was more quantity than quality. I had high hopes, but the food was just mediocre. I would have rather eaten at a fine dining establishment at that price. To me, it was a lackluster experience, but so glad I got it off my bookmark!
Truly the buffet of buffets! Nothing can compare to the quality, variety, and taste of the food. I can honestly say it's the best buffet in Vegas. It is expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for. Go hungry and enjoy!
Oh boy.. . Everything you can think of is served at bacchanal! I usually don't eat big portions but I went back like 5 times just to try a little bit of everything. . . They have Asian, mexican, delicious seafood, and lots of cuts of meat. Mac and cheese, green beans, crab legs, crawdaddies! Ugh I could keep on going.. . The best part was the dessert section. . Cake pops, macaroons, mochi. And even beignets! *drool* . . Everything I had tasted fresh and had plenty of flavor, but my favorite was this mango pudding from the dessert, I wished I had more room to have had one more. . . Service is great but tipping is confusing. You pay before you sit and can write in a tip then. I has cash that I was going to leave at the end so didn't write any on the receipt. I noticed they didn't stamp my ticket with "tip", idk what the purpose of that is. Service was still great, drinks refilled, plates cleared. . . When we first got there we were told an hour wait but got a text in 12 min. Pricey but worth it.
For a buffet place, this place is the king.  Although there were lots of ppl.  it felt like you were the only there.  Other than the dim sum,  the food tasted good.
Man one of the best buffets I been to in Vegas .. Food is fresh and tastes so good .. The staff is super friendly and top of it .
60 bucks! Well worth it. I was tired of spending $30 average on restaurants for just 1-2 entrees. So I said lets do a buffet! This buffet was great all around. Service was excellent as I didnt have to wait in line. I a vip guest. Cut right to the front. Haha. There was about 30 people in line. Service was great. Food was excellent. King crab. Huge shrimp. Raw oyster. They had a Hispanic selection. Asian selection. Sushi. The sushi was standard. The asian food was very good. Even the fried rice was delicious. They also had dim sum. The desserts was good. So much macaroons! Over for $60 I think its well worth it as so much variety with great quality not just quantity. Give it a shot. One of the the better buffets in vegas and I tried many. Come extra hungry.
I come to Vegas very often especially to try out the new restaurants since I am a true foodie and I heard so much hype about this place of course I had to try it. . . When I got there the lines was ridiculously long.  They said the wait was over 3 hours long.  I don't know if it's just me but I would never wait in line for 3 hours to eat anywhere.  Luckily my husband is a VIP card holder so we didn't have to wait in the long line which was definitely a plus.  Otherwise I would have left without trying this place.. . I have tried mostly all the buffets in Vegas so I had really high expectations for this place. For a buffet their decor is very impressive.  Maybe that's why their prices are a bit higher than most other buffets in Vegas.  . . The food was pretty good and the dessert selection was great but I don't see anything that really stands out about this place except for the fact that you have to stand in line for hours for most people and that the price is more than most of the other buffets where you can get about the same quality of food for less in my opinion.  . . If your a first timer in Vegas this place will most likely be impressive.  For all the regulars I don't think it's worth all the hype.
By far got too be the last Vegas yelper check out the Bacchanal Buffet. Save the best review for last. LOL! Right off not much of buffet person in general but the last two trips at buffet. Like to think hit current top two Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal. Not so entirely different besides the obvious both PRICEY although Wicked Spoon save little bit. Thankfully got here super early so no dealing with horror stories of long waits or find that fast pass get in and out. I guess some card program or whatever jump ahead in line. Still always hook. This one sure you go in separate line still have wait so really that much faster?? Best advice go early if want to avoid lines. Thankfully my friends visiting had good day gambling so never had pay the ridiculous price for dinner. . . The food I had nothing but praise for the diversity of food! Somethings that found never seen before at a buffet. The ramen station. On this night never got any cause the person working the station was non existence or even was at the station had back turned seem disinterested checking for customers. Needless too say never tried any. They had station of freshly squeezed juices in little kraft glasses all on ice and nice setup. Horchata as one of the choices found interesting. I went with the guava tasted really refreshing and good. The cold seafood section with the snow crab legs not often you see. I think snow crab legs are over rated besides lot of work get meat out. I rather stick with the crab legs. The craving station was mile high of meats from prime rib, sausage,brisket, and sure missing couple more. The sushi station though great was rolls not just your standard fare ones but spicy tuna and not just bland ones. The nigiri looked pretty good (tasted pretty solid for buffet) and again more then just your standard ones. The charcuterie station with meats and cheeses and breads. Something hardly see in buffets. Thumbs up! Ethic stations or trend in buffets got your italian station, asian station, and so on. Some hit or misses but its buffet with that many options it is what it is. The dessert station again like the diversity. They even make fresh crepes. I was way full get any. Overall the food here is really good and although paying for it like to think getting the quality in the price.. . The things dislike. I think the tables are WAY too close to one another. I felt like eating in cafeteria at times. Three of us. The next round table literally tight fit turn the table around so  one of my friends could slide her chair in and out. Our server not the quickest came getting our drinks and keeping them filled. The location it tucked in the back. So if not sure Bacchanal can be hard to find.
O my this buffet has everything and is hands down maybe the best buffet in the vegas strip... Yes I said it, best as in better than WS.. . why you ask? K. here it goes.. . quality of food. Ambiance.. almost the same amount of variety as WS, Bacchanal just had a nod more. Especially desserts. The sushi and Asian food selection much more home style cooked which I liked a lot. This time around the seafood much better and tasty. All the amenities and condiments made the food experience of taste and flavor much better. Also the Spanish/ Mexican cuisine was awesome!!! great Tacos, great condiment bar and especially the juices. . . yes, there are different selections. WS had bone marrow, and yes its delightful and hard to find places that serve it. But it wasn't amazing I thought it would be. However, Bacchanal has a great variety and it's selection compared to WS... what I liked most was after each cultured section there are condiments after condiments. For example, Chinese had there soy sauce, garlic chips, preserved eggs and onions. Thai/ Vietnamese had all the spices, limes and basil. That is what amazed me was giving the customer the opportunity to customize of enhance all the flavors and foods to there specs. So many extras and extra ingredients after each section I loved. As a chef this is a for sure hit and a great way to experiment with your food. Bow down!! and a round of applause and smiles from my side of party goers and restaurant loyalists you sure thought out every little spec to be the best buffet!. Thank you for a great experience... O also a side note i compared WS and bacchanal by eating trying each one in a 4 day stretch. 1st day bacchanal for dinner, 2nd day WS for brunch.. 3rd day took a break from eating.. 4th day bacchanal for brunch. boom! thank you chefs keep it up!
What a waste of money.  We came here last year and the food was so much better!  And they had lots of different foods, the food was in cute little portion, it was so good and look amazing too! I've been looking forward to coming back to vegas for this buffet, but I am extremely disappointed. This year we come here with family of 5 for lunch spent $200 and the food wasn't good! Just like a regular buffet anywhere else. My husband ate about $5 worth of food.
Good buffet, worth your money if you are a seafood lover! The chicken and waffles along with the fresh crepe were good too! Mimosa on weekends.
I have been to Vegas plenty and experienced good and bad buffets.  Bellagio and Aria, great!  Monte Carlo and Luxor, not so much.   . . The Bacchanal is one of the good ones.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and although there was a wide array of food, they weren't trying to do every type of dish of every single cuisine.  I was really surprised by their Asian selection.  The sushi tasted made to order and was super fresh as was their pad thai.  So, so good.  . . As is to be expected, their seafood section was mobbed.  Although the crab legs were the most visited area, I thoroughly enjoyed their crawfish boil, mussels in lemon sauce, and clams in a garlic sauce.  Those were the standout seafood dishes for me.  . . As expected, the lines can be quite long but service is great.  It seems they have a dedicated waitress and busboy for each section so there isn't a huge pileup on plates or empty drinks.  . . If you are looking for an intimate meal, this is not the place to go.  It's always bustling and always full.  But impressive food for a buffet!
Not bad.. Really clean. Great desserts. Liked it over most buffets in Vegas.
AMAZING!! Hands down the best Buffett I have ever been to. So much options to choose from you really have to your time in each area. Not only is there a great option with food but drinks as well. . . I gave it a 4star because of the set up. It can be a but confusing if you have never been here before but other then that from the quality, options, and service it was well worth it. Not once did we have to call a server everything was brought to you before you could even ask. Drinks where refilled halfway through. . . I do suggest you plan your time you will be in line for atleast over a hour. Don't try everything at once cause you don't enjoy it. You have to really go section by section and every option they had especially the desert area was well worth trying. I don't eat Mexican food but those fresh tacos where great! . . We will be back for more!!
Overall I was pretty happy with most of the selections offered here!  I left full and satisfied.. . I love buffets that have salmon sashimi (in this case nigiri).  I ate many many many.  The oysters were not that good though, disappointingly.  Oh yes, if they have the lava cake...eat multiple of those.  SO good.. . The ticket system is pretty convenient.  Instead of waiting in line you get a ticket to come back at a certain time.  It's a win win because you'll won't have to wait, but you'll probably go spend money in their casino gambling or drinking in the meantime.
Wow. This is the king buffet of all buffets! Awesome food, awesome service, and awesome ambiance! Any time I am in Vegas or anyone for that matter, this is a must stop!
Stop! before proceeding to check in with the lady you need to first check in at the kiosk, don't forget to print out your ticket.  . . A long line for seafood. You have an option of having it steamed rather than eating it cold.  . . FREE MIMOSAS w/refill or champagne.  . . Lady filled us in with where is where in buffet . Entrance is seafood, meats, all American, Italian, Asian food.-thai, Chinese, Japanese . . FRESH which wicked spoon lacks.  . . Dessert is heavenly.  . . Cheers need to catch up on my mimosas
Wait, wait, wait, and wait. Three hours of waiting time  to eat something here. What's the point of kiosk check in.  When your time is up, you wait on the line to pay, wait to be seated, wait to get your food...... . This is my last time coming here.
Yummy!. We went to the breakfast buffet. For two it was about $63 since we are not total reward members. The food was amazingly good. Come hungry. Fresh juiced juice. and almost any breakfast food you could think of. Everything tasted great. The staff was very friendly on the floor as well as behind the counter. Five star service and food. For breakfast they had seafood, American, Mexican, Indian, and Asian. We were not hungry again late that night. This is really an outstanding place that is worth the price.
Beware, DIMINISHING QUALITY coupled with increasing prices.  Utter disappointment.  Just finished dinner on Sunday night at $57 per head.  No king crab legs, only snow crab. Not to mention the most watery not sweet puny stone crab claws I've had.  My Gf said the oysters were too sandy so she had only one.  Dishes are not in individual portions like they were in the past but like all low quality buffetts, dishes sit in large vats getting mushy and overcooked. This effect made the clams and mussels all dried and rubbery. Crab croquettes and crab fried rice no longer available.  All corn and no lobster in lobster chowder. Carne asada tacos chewy and not even close to par with King Taco.  Real gelato no longer served but instead sub with super sweet cheap ice cream with fake plastic props in display case.  Total waste of money. Food was overall too salty (pho, bbq )or too sweet(ice cream). And really?! Displaying decorative seashells instead of awesome fresh seafood that used to be in the seafood station. Real gaudy.
Breakfast, nothing worse than cold eggs, cold french toast , would have been better off at a Dennys, not sure how you can mess up breakfast so bad. We even got another plate thinking it was just cold first time. Nope , all bad
The managers attitue made me very unpleasent . She said her name was Stephanie . 8/26/14 . I came for breakfast with the 24 hour pass looking forward to eating cause i was starved from playing and not eating all night . So after i spent all my cash i had on me i come to find out by the incredibly rude staff thats theres gonna be a 15$ chage for the buffet Omg!!!! .i asked to speak with management because she couldent show me where it said that . She said all other buffets were closed and laughed and started to walk away . I guess its because i am 25 so she didnt take me serious but i wont be returning here to play or to go to any of there restrurants . Its a shame i have always been treated fair here . Long story short she said she was calling security on me i waited they never came and she walked off what a joke i was expecting a way better experience
This so far would have to be my favorite buffet out of vegas as of right now until someone decided to redo their buffet. . . Caesars old buffet was pretty out-dated so I was super happy that they decided to spend some big cash on updating it and must I say they did a heck of a job. . . This buffet has everything you want to eat. They have seafood, sushi, comfort food, tacos bar, salad bar, pasta, dim sum, noodle bar, Chinese food, pizza, etc etc etc. . . Also, whatever dessert you are cravings..they have it. They have cakes, cookies, crepes, gelatos, tarts, macarons. I can just get sugar high just thinking about it. . . This is actually a place I would drive four hours just to eat here. Too bad the line will take that long too. Overall, try it out! I would just avoid during holiday and busy weekends. Or make friends with a seven star or diamond members so you can go in the shorter line.
The food was great and the people working there were wonderful.. My motherin law is very old - Miss Perez and Taylor - the general manager and the manager were very helpful. I can not wait to go back.
Lines lines and more lines. This is the second time i have been to vegas and tried it based on the reviews and friends reference. We went and took the ticket and wait was approximately 55 minutes which is not bad compared to the 3+ hours the others stated on here. We came back in an hour and then realized we have to wait once again to get in. After that we got to another line which were seperated in 3 groups. The VIPs, the couples, and the big groups. . . Then we were seated promptly after another 30 minutes. We had complementary mimosas and drinks. We wandered around to find food and yet there are more lines. One line for seafood, one for tacos , one for crepes, one for ice cream. Lines everywhere and to be honest the food wasnt even that great. Its really the rave that got people here. I regret waiting 15 minutes for 4 tacos because I didnt know what the line was about. . . Sure the decor was nice, the staff dressed professional but the food was average at best. I feel very proud of myself for not spending a huge amount of money on the buffet of buffets pass and paying extra for this. Overall at least I can tell my friends ive been here.
Lots and lots of options! Very appealing to the eye on presentation as well. Went on a Wednesday at 11am and didn't wait in line at all. I only wish they had snow crab legs but they have dungeness instead (just a personal preference) side note if you sign up for the players card you will receive 10% off the buffet , every bit helps!
Not impressed at all. I had high hopes and was really let down. Wicked spoon is way better. Nothing special at all here. Nothing was great and barely anything was good. Service wasn't even good. I will not be back.
Bacchanal Buffet is probably the best buffet in Vegas.  Actually it is the best buffet in Vegas.  Hence the near $50 price tag.  Lots of options on food here. They carried stone crab when they first opened, but not anymore.. . Lines are long so come early. Decor is neat and the desserts were probably the least impressive out of all the food.
Came on Thursday at 1pm during LUNCH (not dinner, so this is not a dinner review) and there was no line.  The lady that rang us up forgot to tell us that the tip we signed on the bill was intended for our server.  Only then did we find out that the tip on the dotted line was meant for our server, embarrassing!  But we did leave a tip for our server in case you're wondering.. . Onto the food.. . Flat out, this place is overrated.  The photos you see on the net are glamourized.  Not as big as everyone says.  Options available for the most part are ordinary.  Quality is what you would expect of a buffet.  The dishes were lukewarm, bordering on almost cold.  Sushi is stale and dry.  Roast beef was average, but the chef that manned the carving station is a total sweetheart!  Shrimp and grits was, well, shrimp and grits.  The pulled pork sliders were better than I expected.  Didn't try the mini hotdogs.  Didn't try the cold fried chicken.  No king crab legs.  Didn't even go near the Asian section as the dishes looked stale, you know that dull-dry-sauce-look on foods?  Yep.  So what did I try?  The mushroom truffle soup, salty and creamy, it was alright if you like those flavors.  The clam chowder was alright, not as bad as I thought.  But nowhere near as good as the clam chowders from San Francisco (not a fair comparison as Vegas is in the desert and SF is by the bay).  I noticed that no one touched the salads on their plates, so I didn't go there either.  Boy, it sounds like I tried a lot of nothing!  But I actually tried 4 plates worth of food.  But nothing really stood out!  Oh yeah, the seafood paella looked great!  And it was actually just GOOD, not great.  You know what they had a lot of?  4 different pizzas; cheese, pepperoni, mushroom and deluxe style.  But who wants to eat pizza for this price!  And they had lots of sauces and salsa for the Mexican cuisine station...16 sauces and salsa! C'mon! Who is going to waste stomach space on salsa and chips!  However, you can the chefs to make you fresh tacos, which were ok.  If you like street tacos, you'll like these.  . . I read they have 20 different breads to choose from?  Only five to choose from and they were stale.. . A small island for desserts.  Now I admit, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so the desserts were mediocre.  The chocolate lava cake was probably the best thing there, it was piping hot and oozing when I broke into it.  Nothing special about the gelato and I'm a huge gelato fan!  Only the lemon sorbet was palatable.  Tried the pistachio, raspberry, and mango also, meh.  . . So is this buffet worth the high price tag? Not in my book.  But I'm glad I tried it, so I can say that it was alright.  The price should actually be $10 cheaper.  That's what I think this buffet is worth.
Decided to go because I read many reviews rating Bacchanal in Caesar's Palace as number one buffet in Vegas. While you're going to pay a steep price, $50, every dollar spent was worth it. Had the salad, cheeses, sushi, crab legs, salmon, lamb chops, horchata, ribs, shrimp, mashed potatoes, green beans, oysters, and many, many desserts. I could go on and on but if you're in Vegas and want a big meal that actually feels worth it, just go.
The taxis are not lying when they are driving around the Las Vegas trip advertising Bacchanal Buffet as the #1 buffet in town. This is THE BEST buffet in Vegas, and probably on the West Coast. . . My boyfriend was skeptical about this buffet because prior to it becoming the Bacchanal Buffet, he claims there was a really bad buffet he had tried at Caesar's Palace. Honey, that was 3 years ago, lol. It reinvented itself, and Bacchanal was born in 2012. . . If you're worried about the price ($58/ person), I suggest you don't gamble, you don't drink, you don't go clubbing and save your $58, and eat here instead. It has an upscale environment like a club, minus the drunk people and having drinks spilled on top of you. Plus, you aren't losing money because this buffet claims to have over 500 food items and they are not exaggerating. . . And you don't have to doubt about the freshness of the food either; The seafood section of the buffet is filled with freshly caught fish, oysters, crab, etc. They are literally prying the oysters open while you're in line. It doesn't get any fresher than that. . . Just a little warning, because I didn't do this, but I ate way too much to my heart's content- MEANING, I wasn't able to enjoy the beautiful display of desserts in front of me. My boyfriend tried to feed me chocolate, but I just couldn't have anything anymore. . . We went on a Friday night, about 7pm, and the wait was 20 minutes... I was skeptical because the line was so long, but you tend to move pretty quickly because there are so many tables inside. . . *My margarita cost me $8 but it didn't taste like a margarita, lol *
One of the better buffets I've been to. It's this or The Buffet at the Wynn. Price is not too bad. Good selection. You'll definitely find something you love. I've heard the wait can be hours. We went on Monday for brunch. We were quickly shown to a table.
Food was great, 1.5 hour wait, paid $20 per person to only wait 1/2 hour in line in staed. Line to geat food was also long, buddy waited almost an hour to get carb legs and prime rib. Price i cant complain as our meal was comp due to a cockroach decided to join us for brunch. Moved us to another table, gave us front of the line passes for each of us (good for only 1 person). Manager brought our buddy a plate full of crab legs. He also over herd the manager talking to another saying that it wasnt the first time this has happened. If it wasnt for the roach id say its worth the $70.25 we paid initially. but after the roach i dont know. 1 roach means there are millions more hiding.
5 stars for..... -The lightings. -The tables. -Food, (meat, seafood) . Ribs and steak was well marinated.. Sushi bar wasn't bad, . The crab legs, gimme all of that!!. . 1 star for.... -Price. -The long wait. . It was expensive, better eat your share of $50.... The wait was worth it just for the experience, wouldn't really do that again.. The food is so good, it'll make you go broke!
I was very disappointed with this buffet. Take this review with a grain of salt though, I came on Labor Day weekend and so the kitchen was likely understaffed and rushed.. . We waited about two hours to get seated in the buffet and paid $55 since it was a holiday. The food was mediocre, nothing was spectacular. I sampled some of everything. . . The meats were a tad dry and a bit too fatty. The seafood was also dry and flavorless. The Asian food was subpar and uncreative. The desserts did not stand out either. Service was good, and the unlimited breakfast drinks was nice. . . I've eaten better buffets at my college dining halls. Wholly unimpressed with the Bacchanal considering how steep the price is.
Foodies, we just went to Vegas and here is where you should go. Great selection, many wonderful small plates. Good food across the board (okay - sushi could have been better - but everything else was beyond excellent. I especially liked the mushroom truffle soup, but everything was well prepared and super yummy.
I would describe myself as someone who is very familiar with the various buffets in Vegas. Been here twice, and definitely still at the top of my list. The price can be a bit of a scare, but I do believe it's worth it. As you start to try the different dishes, you get a sense that each dish is very well thought out, something that might be at a fancy restaurant, where they give you a small portion on a plate because it's gourmet. Everything here feels better quality than just cooking a whole bunch of mac n cheese in a big pot or pan. It's a strange thing to judge on, but what impressed me is that they had a variety of bottles of fresh squeezed juices. Don't think I've ever seen that, but I think it goes to show the effort they put into each offering.. . I can't just describe one or two things that I really like, but would say that they have one of the widest array of selections, and each one is very good.. . Pay the price, and it's still better than Wynn, Wicked Spoon, etc.. . . One note: there's no need to wait in line now thanks to the interactive kiosks where you check in, and they give you a time to come back. Don't let them trick you. Instead of having you wait in line, they're happy to have you sit and play $20 of video poker, and now your buffet is $70 instead of $50. Don't let them trick you! haha
I work in the food industry and am usually NOT a buffet fan, however 2 years ago we discovered The Wicked Spoon. I fell in LOVE with. So when returning to Las Vegas I saw that. Baccahanal was rated #1 buffet, I stepped out a limb and tried it. . . I was disappointed. The food was OK. I did not like the lay out, I did not like the flow.. . One thing I LOVE about the Wicked Spoon was that EVERY plate IS individual. I DONT like when TONS of people are digging thru my food.. . I will give a plus to the fact we sat for a while and actually enjoyed our dinner company.. . I am sorry, I will go back to Wicked Spoon.
Terrible! They have the worst line management I have ever seen. Very disappointing experience for such a high price. Booo!!!!
a feast for the hungry. it's too good for me not to come back.
