Check in was terrible right now. There was only one person working at the Rush Tower and were staying at the carson. The concierge was taking forever with this guy that had no reservations. And there was more than twenty of us standing in line. I hope the rest of our stay this weekend gets better. :(
Very nice property. It was very busy as there were a lot of people walking around and the pool was packed. We couldn't park in their garage. Only hotel guests with a key could check in. I guess it was very busy, so that is understandable. We had to park at the parking lot in Main Street about 1 block away. $5 to park but the walk was not bad.. . I'd say that the place is a very nice place downtown. Worth the millions of dollars of renovation. Not smokey at all. Lots of nice restaurants and bars/lounges. Plus the pool with the large skate tank was real cool. Supposedly one of the too best pools in America.
You get what you pay for!   Cheap rooms, crowded pool equals nasty smoking people and nasty dirty pool water.  Shark tank is cool but the crowds are not.
The Golden Nugget is good and just inches away from being great.. . The Good:. I stayed in the Rush Tower, which the GN site calls "new". It was either just built or renovated because the rooms were very up to date, very nice, and very big. The bathroom was awesome and now my wife wants one like it. The bed was comfortable and the rest of the room was very clean.. Vic and Anthony's is a high end steak & lobster restaurant with incredible food and an impressive stock of top shelf Scotches. Just be sure to have deep pockets. Dinner for 2 plus drinks came to about $120.. The Grotto is a mid range Italian restaurant with a good menu, a good wine list and a view of the pool. Moderate price, good food.. Red Sushi located next to the casino floor is a good place to get some hand crafted sushi and roles while people watching. Comfortable but a little loud because it is open to the casino.. Both pools were clean, well maintained although neither had a view of anything except the hotel.. The hotel/casino complex is small when compared to monsters like the MGM, which I like since it is easier to navigate, quicker to get to my room if I need something without having to walk past a dozen overpriced shops no one buys anything at, and it has very quick access to Fremont Street from the casino. . . The Bad:. No free wifi. Its 2014 people, get over it! I can get free wifi on a freak'n airplane I think I should be able to get some wifi at a mid-level Las Vegas casino.. I wouldn't have known it was there if I hadn't asked, but there is one bar near Fremont street in the casino that has been designated the International Beer Bar. It isn't on the maps or website, only has a moderate selection and the staff wasn't knowledgeable enough. If you have that name and say you have 40 beers but include terrible domestic beers or super common imports like Becks, you aren't really doing anyone any favors. If the IBB doesn't stock a German Doppelbock they should at least know what it is (not that uncommon) and if they stock Belgian Trappist beers like Chimay Blue and I ask for a Quad, you should know that will work.. I also had mixed luck with the bars. The Rush Bar made me a Godfather cocktail no problem. The H2O bar at the pool had no idea what it was, called someone to find out, and still got it wrong.. Speaking of which the H20 bar is at the pool that closes @ 8pm. The Hideaway Pool on the third floor for adults is open to 2am, but doesn't have a bartender after 8pm. Kinda lame. So your options are to get out dripping wet and go down two levels to get a drink, or hope that a girl collecting towels comes around every 30 minutes and is willing to take a drink order (which they then get wrong.). . The Golden Nugget feels like it might be in transition. They want to go upscale, and offer a whole lot of bang for a pretty good price, with some nice amenities, but fall just short of getting it perfect. If they offer the right services when they should be offered and get their barmen up to speed, I'd say the place was perfect.
Live in Vegas but first time actually going to a bar inside the hotel.  Went to H20 Bar by the pool purchased two drinks I used my credit card. The bartender who had no name badge on called himself "John" charged my cc but only gave me the torn off bottom half of the charge receipt and no itemized receipt. When I disputed this he became really angry. Beware he may be defrauding customers he stated it was there practice . I quickly contacted the management who stated it was not there practice and that they would take care of it
Note:  I did not gamble at all.  Not interested.  . . Pros:. - Pool!  Terrific pool (the main reason we stayed there) with great music (though the DJ could have given a bit more variety).  The fish are awesome, and the sharks are downright distracting.  You are in the pool, and they go casually swimming by in the tank.  Really impressive.  There are a couple of sharks that have razor-like teeth sticking out, and with their sinister-looking eyes, they grab your attention.    . - Rooms are nice, but need more electrical outlets for all the cell phones, iPads, etc. . - Free parking. - Starbucks in the lobby (of course you have to pay for it). - Nice dining area.  All the restaurants are updated, contemporary, modern, and competitive.  If at dinner time you walk down the main corridor where the restaurants are, the terrific smells will make you hungry.  . - Drinks at pool:  Pricing was less than I expected, and less than the awful Serendipity 3.  I think I paid $7 for a bourbon & water.  Not bad considering it was pool-side service. Note:  Bring your ID if you want to charge to your room!   You can also get a small bucket of beer 6 for the price of 5, including ice.  This was popular at the pool.  . . Cons:. - No in-room free coffee?!  This is the first hotel I have stayed in in more than 15 years that didn't give free coffee in the room.  Wow!  That is very CHEAP of the Golden Nugget.  . - No free WiFi.  If you want to connect it is $13 / day.  Seriously?!  . - Lots of smokers walking around and in the casino, too.  Though, that seems to be the same all over the Strip casinos I visited.  I could smell the smoke in my clothes.  . - Clearance in parking deck:  It is LOW!  If you drive a big SUV, then you can't have anything on the roof at all!  . - TV service in the room:  I think the hotel needs to update its wiring.   Our TV suffered from lagging and pixilation.  From past experience this indicates too much content trying to go across old wiring.
Had a so-so experience here. . . Pros - inexpensive, good location for what I needed it for, lot's of dining in-house (my dinner at the Chart House was great), plenty of gambling if you're into that (I'm not), staff was helpful.. . Cons - smoke definitely lingers, was crowded when I was there, loud during day, pool constantly crowded, my room in the carson tower was very dated (I can't be picky since it was inexpensive).. . Generally my experience was pleasant, however when it came to checking out, not so great. I checked out very early morning and they were unable to print my receipt. Okay, no problem since they said they would email when they were able to. Nothing for one day. I called and accounting was not in since it was the weekend, so I left a voice mail. Another day goes by with no response so I emailed. Again, no response. I called again, this time very annoyed since I had to reach out an additional 3 times from checking out just for my receipt, and finally the front desk was able to email it before I got off the phone (lady was extremely sweet and helpful). I'm not sure if all the departments are in constant contact, however, I never heard back from my voice mail or email.
We stayed in the Carson Tower, the older side of the resort. Lower priced than the newer glitzy Rush Tower but the bed was very comfortable & the bathroom worked well. No free WiFi.. Pool is great & lots of restaurant choices. Bars a plenty too. We liked the Rush Bar best. . It is right on the Fremont Experience which is a plus!
Got sick eating at Claim Jumper in the Casino.  Then woke up to beetles in bed with me.  The only cool thing was the pool.
Overall we had a very good stay.  I'm not giving them five stars for two reasons. We paid extra to get a room with a view when we booked the room online at their website. Upon arrival on a Thursday evening we were told rooms with a view were sold out. She said it was first come first served. The view from our window was a wall.She said she upgraded us to a mini suite for the inconvenience but the only difference between a regular room and a mini suite is that the tub has jets. Our friends who came with us paid $60 less and had a gorgeous view out their window and they arrived hours after we did. First come first served?  Whatever.  The second reason is the lack of lounge chairs at the pool. If you don't get there right when the pool opens or pay money to reserve a seat in advance you're pretty much out of luck. . . On the bright side everything else was good.  We had good food and good service at the restaurants and the bars.  The pool is definitely incredible. There was no waiting for the elevators which is always nice.
We had a great stay at Golden Nugget! Great pool, location, restaurant.  Room was very nice, staff is courteous. The gift shops and shopping in the hotel were very reasonable unlike on the strip.  Our only issues were the HVAC system in our room sounded like a Mack truck, and the valet parking was frequently full.  . . Other than that we had a great stay and will be back!
Although the hotel was nice, and has a great pool, parking staff and parking was the worst!  Before booking, check to see if they have events planned for the weekend.  If they do, book somewhere else!  They told us they normally don't even have enough parking for a full hotel and with any kind of event not only does self park fill up by 6pm,   valet even stops taking cars.  They give you an envelope with poor instructions to a public parking structure (that smells of urine) with a voucher to pay for it. When i asked about parking priority for hotel guests they said there was none and was told by the hotel management this parking problem is what we can expect every time there was an event of any kind.  You can tell the parking staff received a lot of complaints about the parking situation because all we got was an an insincere "sorry were full",  shrugs of shoulders and looks of "not my problem".  Not an isolated incident, happened every night of our weekend stay.  So check before booking!
Room was clean and beds were very comfortable. Check in & ticket staff was very nice. 24 hr Starbucks in case you need a fix. The pool gets very crowded even early morning. A good place to stay.
We stayed at the Golden Nugget because my daughter wanted to go to the pool, which I'll review separately. We got a room in the Rush tower, but in the 5th floor, facing a roof of a building with two large flood lights directed at our window.  Fortunately the curtains did a great job of hiding the light.. . Our room was very well appointed and looked exactly like the ones on the website.  There was plenty of storage, the furniture was stylish and the bathroom large.  The bed and pillows were comfortable, and one of my daughters managed to sleep on the modular chair/sofa not too uncomfortably.  There were some problems with the room, e.g. lack of TP, but they were quickly solved.. . One minus if you have kids is that they don't have any children TV channels. We don't have cable at home so my kids like to stay in hotels so that they can watch them, but there were no such options here.  Also, internet is an additional $13.. . All in all I liked the hotel, though it was very crowded.  We usually stay on the strip, and I liked how small this place was and how little I had to walk.  We had dinner at a restaurant in the hotel which was pretty good, and did some gambling as well. It was smokey, but not more than at most hotels.
This is the best hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Hands down. Frankly, it's in the top 25% of the nicest hotels in the city.. . But they know they are the prettiest girl in class so they charge more. A LOT more for everything. (Water and beer is at least 1/2 the price at the ABC store next door!). . But I guarantee you that the crappiest room in the Carson tower is better than the best room at the Plaza.. . Trust me. I post reviews on the Internet.
This hotel is the most bang for your buck! The rooms are nice, it's clean, not too smoky, and the service is on point. I dig the  buffet, and the pool. I will stay here again for sure. At $50 bucks a night you get the whole package!
Oh, the Golden Nugget! . . I was placed at the Golden Nugget for a business trip to World Market Center. I was disappointed my client chose this hotel, since my sister was tagging along for the stay. The Nugget, as we named it, does not offer the glam of the Vegas strip, but rather the retro feel of old Vegas. However, maybe from the excessive gold detailing or maybe from the amazing people watching, the Golden Nugget worked its way into both of our hearts. . . The hotel room was decently clean (the kind of clean where you just choose not to look too closely at the bathroom tiles or peak behind the furniture) and the beds were decently comfortable. The decor was very dated, but somehow charming. . . There weren't many great dining options at the hotel or nearby, which was probably one of the biggest downfalls of staying in old Vegas. While there are options, they just aren't welcoming. As for entertainment, we didn't see any nearby shows, but there is no need to pay for entertainment on Fremont. The "street people" are plentiful, drunk, and usually dancing. Oh, and if you want to meet Elvis, this is the place! We spent most of our nights taxiing to the strip. Transportation was not cheap (about $25 one-way) but we ran out of Fremont-fun. . . I would not come back to the Golden Nugget on my own, but we do talk fondly of our time here! Overall, it was a decent stay... and since we are both Karat Club members now (why not?) we get email deals for $40 stays. You can't beat that.
Very nice stay. Rooms were clean and well kept.  (We had two rooms in the Carson Tower and I was worried after reading some other reviews. The bedding was new and there were flat screens, if that is important to you.) Pool was fun and tank was very entertaining. Casino was clean and had lots of tables open. Dinner at Vic & Anthony's was amazing. I would definitely stay at the GN again.
I really wanted to like this property more. Although I have stayed in Vegas numerous times, this was my first Downtown LV experience. It will also probably be my last. First some positives, the Gold Tower rooms are good size and nicely appointed and the beds are comfortable. Also, the shark tank pool is a fun experience. Okay, well that's about it for the good stuff.. Now, why won't I stay here again? The rooms "look" nice but they are still in an old building. It has been a long time since I stayed in a place with the old wall A/C that bangs all night long and is controlled by a push button and knob. That's right, no room thermostats so plan on getting up in the middle of night to turn off the unit because it's freezing or simply making too much noise. Speaking of noise...three mornings in a row we were woken up by banging noises on the upper floor. At first we thought someone had been murdered and they were getting rid of the evidence, but nope, it was just the 6AM construction crew doing the upper floor remodels getting started with their day. That's right 6AM! Lot of fun after getting back to the room at 2AM. Finally, after they started banging we were able to get back to sleep and left our room at 2PM for a late lunch and to start the day. Apparently that is too late for Housekeeping because when we returned in the evening, our room looked the same, no made up bed, no clean towels etc. Bottom line, this is a 2-3 star property that wants you to think it's on par with Caesars Palace but the truth is it fits perfectly with the other lower end hotels of Downtown Las Vegas.
Just got home from staying 3 nights here. The room price was good for the carson tower and the resort fee was only 5 dollars a day. I was traveling with my 2 kids and one of them is 2 and there was not ONE decent kids tv channel. Hellooo people sometimes have to travel with small children and need an evening tv option!!! We got stuck in the elevator and ended up getting comped the buffet .... GROSS it was the worst buffet I've eaten in las vegas. I'm so glad I didnt pay for it. The pool was the main reason for staying here and it gets my 3 stars.
The rooms are OK but really the gem here is the pool party.... The shark tank pool is awesome and the DJ was better then most of the headliner DJs featured around Vegas. A+++ for DJ Dezi? And I don't even like EDM that much.
Pool is great Hotel surroundings are nice.  Gold towers upgraded $20 worst upgrade ever . air conditioning doesn't work rooms are smoked heavily for a non smoking  terrible time I do not recommend staying at least in the Gold Tower not worth the money .I have a maintenance man in my room its 1:30 a.m. Replacing the AC. first time staying here probably my last. I usually stay at the Luxor about the same price . Accommodations are real nice real clean and true non smoking rooms.  I recommend taking a cab over to Fremont experience.
Golden nugget hotel.... We stayed there this past week. Although the pool was kinda crowded there were a lot of nice people there. The casino has a 10$ min so we gambled elsewhere but the room was nice and clean the bed was comfortable and the staff was nice. I got bill upon check out and the room ended upcosting less then they told is by 50$ I say this go see time share they give you a hundred and twenty five dollars in chips which my wife turned into 575$ cash on the roulet wheel and you get a free vacation. Not a bad gig. I'd stay there again any day.
You know, I would love living on the Strip but dude, some of the hotels are just not worth it. I saw the room my cousin stayed in at Caesar's Palace and it was pretty bad. The room was small, a little jenky, didn't have a fridge or anything, and the view sucked. AND it was twice as much as our room at the Golden Nugget. Our room at the Golden Nugget made the room at Caesar's Palace look like a joke (but to be fair, you're really just paying to live on the Strip). . . If you're not looking to go clubbing or drinking on the Strip and just want a nice, inexpensive place to place (but still get some of the Vegas vibe), I think this is a good place to stay. Located in the "Old" part of Las Vegas, if you go downstairs, there are still a few casinos in the area that you can still gamble at. For the price and what you're getting, it's really not bad. The room we got was comfortable, spacious, and pretty clean. Plus they have an awesome pool here so that's another plus!
As a single parent, I like this hotel, but will also never stay here again.. Wifi is $13, per 24 hours, the pool closes early in the summer (8 PM!), there are no kids channels on the tv (which forced me to pay $13 for a movie they'd already seen!), and you have to PAY for your in-room coffee! . I will easily pay slightly higher, for a smaller room, "uptown", with the included amenties, and closer to the majority of the Strip action.
We stayed here in January and I thought I had written a review then but apparently not. I purchased a Groupon to stay at this hotel and the first night the air conditioning clanked super loud all night. My husband recorded it and showed it to the front desk. They didn't care. They told us they weren't sure if they would be able to move our room. We told them they had to since we didn't sleep all night and we had our kids with us. The TV had problems as well and maintenance had to come out. Every interaction we had with staff was rude. The manager in the buffet was walking through the food area typing on her phone and never looked up. She almost bumped into a couple of people. The staff doesn't move out of guests way at all.The buffet was HORRIBLE for breakfast.When I spoke the manager he didn't care.  I wrote an e-mail and have never received response. However when I informed Groupon about our experience they refunded me. I was shocked and not expecting that at all. Groupon rocks but Golden Nugget stinks! I will definitely be staying somewhere else next time.
My friends and I decided to spend our Saturday afternoon at the golden gate pool with some cocktails and do a little bit of gambling. Once we got to golden nugget valet, valet was full. So we had to park elsewhere (which was another huge ordeal) and walk to the pool. . . When we arrived, it was super busy. (We expected that since it was Saturday.) My friends and I all agreed to get a table so we can get bottle service. One of the waitresses got us a table within 20 minutes of our arrival. Once we asked for a drink/bottle menu, it took her 20 minutes to deliver us one. We eventually got tired during our wait and went to the bar ourselves and grabbed our own drinks. . . The shark tank is cool but quite small. Sort of makes you feel bad how many sharks are in this tank with such limited space. . . Children everywhere...EVERYWHERE! And since the adult section was beyond full, we had to hang around with them. I don't hate children, but I just didn't feel right having cocktails and smoking cigs next to one. . . The worst part was people swimming in their clothes. Men jumping in with their basketball shorts and old tshirts. Women in their basketball jerseys while wearing old sneakers to swim in. Babies swimming in soiled diapers. I found that quite trashy because all other hotel pools forbid any other attire other than swim suits and sandals inside the pool. . . Once we got to top section of the hotel pool, (the adults section finally has some vacancy) it was a bit more relaxing but the music was different from downstairs. I swear it was putting me to sleep. . . You'd be better off going to the pool during the weekday where it's less busy with people and children. It was obvious the waitresses couldn't handle the rush which took forever to recieve proper service. Last year, 2013 I had a blast but that's cause I went on a Monday afternoon. Stay away in the weekends.
I stayed here with a friend earlier this month. We got an awesome deal thanks to Cyber Monday so our 4 night stay ended up costing around $145 total. (The basic cheapest room.) The room itself was okay. Nothing to write home about. My only complaint is the beds are small. (But to be fair they are advertised as the correct size.) The main reason we chose the Nugget was because of their pool. Unfortunately, the first two days it was raining with thunder (off and on) so they closed the pool early but our other two days were good. One awesome part of the pool is that the upper pool closes at 2am. We had a blast with fellow hotel guests drinking, laughing and swimming.  The only bummer  was the pool boy who was dubbed the fun police. Why? Because he would tell people to stop splashing each other. Wth?!!! We are grown ass adults. Older than this dude, probably. No one was bothered by the splashing because everyone was doing it. Everyone was having fun. The security guards even wondered what the heck his problem was. Anyway, all in all it was a decent stay. Would I stay here again? Yes. For four days? No.
Pleasantly surprised is the best way to describe our experience at this hotel.  We stayed in Carson Towers, which are the cheapest rooms, but they were nice,  comfortable and roomy (we had two adults and two hyperactive boys). I will definitely stay here again.
My GF and I came out from Philly for a week for our 1 year anniversary.. It was and AWESOME stay. The pool is great, the staff is friendly, the restaurants were great, and Fremont street is insane!. The rooms are large and clean.. I would highly recommend staying here.
Stayed here a few nights. For what this is, a downtown, older-school, moderately priced casino hotel, it's just fine. Not any aspect of the hotel enhanced our Vegas experience; nor did it detract from it.
