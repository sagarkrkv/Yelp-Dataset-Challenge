Great pizza! Fast and inexpensive, not 2 things I've found anywhere else in the Cosmopolitan Vegas. Love that I had to be shown where it was, because it REALLY is secret. I had the sausage and pepper pizza and loved it. Also loved that a slice and a soda only cost $9!
If you want a nice slice, this is where to go.  We've been many times and everything has always been great. Order your slices, find a spot and do the old lean and eat.  Can't beat the convenience.  Wed night not very busy, Saturday afternoon in the middle of summer, there is a line down the hall.  But hay, that's when the people watching gets good.  Would I go back?  Absolutely!
Sooooo good!! Super friendly staff and Erin (Kap) was great!!! Go niners!!! . . Hands down the best pizza we've had in a long time. The white sauce pizza is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Expect a little wait though. It may be a "secret", but it's still POPULAR!!! A+++
What a great place if you have the time to wait it well worth it. Top 10 pizza places I have ate anywhere. A hole pie takes about 30 min so get a pice of siclan!!!!!!
Good-tasting, good-sized pizza. Perfect late night munchies! It's easy to miss, though. Look for the pool table on the 3rd floor close to a gallery with some nice wood furniture around it.. It's right down the hall.. . The pizza was delicious! And not just because I was drunk:)
What a great spot! Hard to find. The slice I had was fantastic. There's essentially no seating and the restaurant is amazingly tiny. Not cheap but that's Vegas
Awesome pizza joint. If you're going to get 3 or more slice just buy a whole pizza. Cheap large & tasty food for vegas prices. I will come again. Maybe tomorrow morning and the next lol
Always so amazing. We always, ALWAYS stop by when we are in Vegas. The last time we came to vegas was mostly to come to here. It is that good. Be sure to try the white pizza and also the mushroom. Both so so good.. . Don;t miss this place if you are in Vegas. Please, oh the humanity!
In a town where things stay a secret, it was nice to find something worth sharing. I'm that snobby NYer. I judge every slice of pizza that isn't up to the NY standard.. . Can you imagine the elation when I not only discovered this "secret"...shhh! But, pizza outside NY that is so good it tamed my snob.. . Look for the long hallway strewn with vintage pictures and faint peek-a-boo of a pinball machine. Those context clues will lead you the best pizza Vegas has to offer.. . All I ask is you get the Sicilian slice and don't use knives or forks please!
At 4am in the morning, anything tastes good to me.  However, I also did get the chance to try the pizza in my more sober moments, so you can trust my tastebuds.  . . Tucked between Blue Ribbon Sushi and Jaleo is this retro looking pizza joint that is opened 24 hours (I believe).  They have the standards, cheese and pepperoni, and deliciously greasy sicilian pizza.  A slice and a drink will cost you around . $6, so it's definitely a steal.  . . Of course there are amazing restaurants at the Cosmopolitan and right outside the hotel doors.  But when it's super late and you just want a quick and yummy bite before heading to your hotel room, Secret Pizza definitely comes in handy!
Secret Pizza. Let's face it, it's not really so secret anymore. Perhaps Slightly Hidden Pizza, or No Signage Pizza - that last one begs to be said while touching your thumb and forefinger together and shaking them as you say the name in your best Italian accent.. . Other names come to mind: . . 1) Tasty Pizza. Full of garlic and cheese, this name is far more apt than "Secret".. . 2) Food and Drinks for Two for $19.50 Pizza. A big mouthful for sure, but so are their slices.. . 3) Opens at 11am Pizza. It's pretty popular with the late night crowd, but at 11am we had the whole joint to ourselves. I'm guessing all the 3am pizza eaters are still sleeping at this hour.. . 4) Near a Pool Table Pizza. There is a pool table out front. Nobody kicked us out, or charged us a penny for shooting a game of pool while we waited for Secret Pizza to open, so we shot a game of pool on the most entertaining landmark you will see on your way to the best pizza on the strip.. . 5) 4.5 Star Pizza. I'm really stingy with my 5th star. If it wasn't for a Pizza I had in New York this would be a 5, but once you've had the best, all other pizzas just try to mimic them. Still, I'm teetering on the 5th star. I will definitely come back - this is research worth doing!
3rd Floor by STK.. Come here.. Chill outside and play pool or check out the rad art exhibit thing.. Or stay inside and enjoy the rad arcade games, TV and awesomeeee dudes that work here.. . Bomb pizza.. Large slices.. . Just get a whole pizza and split with friends. Worth the wait. Better deal price wise.. . Oh, and did I say it yet? The dudes that work here are awesome.
So yummy! Pricey for just a slice of pizza, but well with it. RICOTTA AND TOMATOES was delicious! Slices are small so I'd suggest just making this a pit spot.
Meh. It was good, don't get me wrong. And there was a novelty to it. But they were out of white pizza, we had to wait probably 45 minutes total. Ok, it's decent and different pizza. Got the white slice with sausage and it was SO greasy I was embarrassed as I washed my hands next to someone in the restroom and grease and cheese and herbs were filling the basin. It's ok for the novelty of saying you ate at "secret pizza," and it's an ok deal, especially for the strip. But still, just meh. Also, the sticker that said "people love us on Yelp!" kind of ruined the "secret"... ;)
I'm sure everyone and their mama's has been to Secret Pizza ESPECIALLY if you've stayed at the Cosmo. IF you haven't, GET ON THE BANDWAGON NOW!! . THIS PIZZA is so good late at night, after the day club, as a snack, as a dinner. HELL, ITS JUST DAYM GOOD! This is the one place I always make a pit stop to While I'm in Vegas. . . CHEESY, OILY, DECADENT, JUICY. You'll feel like you are in pizza's heaven for that one minute while you are devouring the pizza. . . TIP: If you've never tried peppercinis as a topping, TRY IT NOW. Tastes soooo much better roasted.
I'm not sure why this place gets so many good reviews because they're pizzas are just Meh... Its just overly hyped up because its the "secret" pizza joint at the Cosmo and everyone gets so excited over it because now they get to go treasure hunting. But in the end you find out its not really a "secret" due to the long freakishly slow line and the pizzas don't taste like something I would treasure. . . I've had it three times already in three different occasions because we were staying at the Cosmo and it was late and we were hungry and I was not about to be on hold for 40 mins to order room service (I don't want to get into that cause that deserves whole another review all on its own). On all three occasions I was hungry and pretty inebriated and not once did I think it was best pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Cause everything taste pretty good when your drunk right? Not really... I just ate it and thought to myself "Okay, I'm hungry, and this will do". . . Just for the hell of it I will give it an extra star instead of one for being there for me when I needed to satisfy my late night hunger. But really guys and dolls, I promise it wont be the most exquisite pizza you've ever had. The end.
I don't give 5 stars often. I am from California and it's hard to find a good pizza. I'm gonna go ahead and say it, This is the best pizza i've ever had in my life. Crust was perfect. Sausage and pepperoni were fresh. I cannot  compare it to New York or Chicago pizza because i've never been there. But if you are in Vegas, this is a must have. Pizza was a little greasy, but if you're complaining about grease you shouldn't be eating pizza anyway. Cant wait to go back!
With social media's help and Yelp around, nothing that happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas. Which was good for me because I found a few hidden gems during our most recent trip including the Secret Kitchen.. . I think this place was dubbed "secret" by some poor drunken soul who got lost finding it, or lost finding his way back to the elevators. It's located past the large conference rooms on the 3rd floor, and you will know you're almost there because, out of nowhere, you will start to see people heading back to the elevators. . . It took us about 10-15 minutes to order and I was grateful that this $5 slice did not disappoint. Thin but crunchy crust with super satisfying toppings (I'm not sure if it was due to late night hunger or too much to drink or both, but I inhaled my slice within minutes). Love the sausage, salami and pepperoni. I also liked that they offered oregano/garlic powder/parmesan/chili flakes at the counter, which reminded me of the pizza places in NYC. . . We ate here twice during our Vegas stay and our experience was consistently the same: long line, good pizza, barefoot women.
Definitely a cool place to visit and eat. I usually, actually...always come here when when Im inebriated and too lazy to take a taxi to further location. This place is perfect for those who are staying at the cosmopolitan and perfect for those weakling laggers who cant handle their booze anymore. Why? Because its secretly and conveniently located at the upper floors of the Cosmopolitan by STK and Scarpetta. I recommend the Scillian Slize. This thick crusted bad boy is packed full of flavor and gives it that rustic taste from the oven. In my book, whatever looks more ooey and gooey with cheese is always a winner for me!. . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. . UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
Went back and tried the white slice. I am pretty sure it was crushed up angels, unicorns, and full on magic in my mouth.....so freaking good!!. . I no longer care that this pizza is $5-$6 a slice..it's worth it!
This place is great if you have been out all night and want some "drunk food". On weekends roughly 11pm this place gets packed. Expect to wait at least 45-60 minutes  to get a slice. If you want to order a whole pizza I would recommend calling ahead(if they even pick up), it's about an hour wait if you call in. If you are in line waiting for a slice but decide to get a whole pizza instead, its about 20-30 minutes for a whole pizza, depending how busy it is.  It can be a little pricey, but it's Vegas, almost everything is overpriced. If you don't mind dishing out $5 a slice, or $6 with a drink, you should definitely make your way over here. . . I would recommend getting the white pizza.
+That box wine comes with a HEAVY pour.. +Delicious pizza. Lots of varieties. . -"Secret" aspect is silly and makes it tough to find after you may or may not be intoxicated.. +"Secret" aspect may actually keep the typically long line a little bit shorter than it'd be if there was signage. . +Friendly service.
this is a great case of reviews inflated by alcohol.  the late night crowd that lines up for pizza is incredibly annoying and not a bit discriminating.
Cosmopolitan second floor down hallway with pictures of records. Unlabeled. Two man staff. . . Came here for a dinner or day cap meal after drinking and enjoying the town. Line was quick to come go and order. . . Simple enough menu one or multiple topping pizzas. Calzone and a Sicilian pizza were also available. Most basic pizza ready. Custom or added topping only a few minutes for slice. All slices had to be reheated for variety of toppings on hand. Irregardless of pizza order, all slices reheated. Still good not great and not so heavy. Priced like the other small pizza places around. . . We ordered and shared a Sicilian deep dish enough for two persons. Pepperoni, sausage, olive among deep stack of melted cheese. Good flavor. Reheated correctly and good on a budget. . . Overall enjoyed the quick grub. Great on budget. Okay on flavor. Hearty are the slices. Would likely come back. Only three stars as the slice is already made and reheated. Not as fresh as can be and service was okay. Nothing too stellar.
The pizza was well worth the wait. I highly recommend trying a pizza already created by the pizzaologists. . . There's always people in line and that's understandable because the kitchen is so small and there are only 4 workers. When I went everyone was working really hard except for the two managers just shooting the breeze with one another. Basically they were taking up room and air.. . I would say call in the order but we tried calling in our order and the phone kept ringing and ringing. Going in person though is much better. While you're waiting in line u can strike up random conversations with people all standing in line for the same thing...PIZZA!!!!! Or check out the million of pictures they have along the walls as u wait:)
Loved the food...no need to be drunk to eat it! Went on a non-busy day and received great service.
Trying to find Secret Pizza my first time was hard.  I was about 3 pm and we were just wondering around the third floor of the Cosmo and had to keep asking around where it was. We had passed by this obscure corridor a few times and had no idea that was the entrance to Secret Pizza.  Well I guess that's the secret.  Try finding this place at about 2 am is a lot easier, there are tons of post night clubbers, or other late night eaters trying to get their grub on.  You'll most likely see a line into the hall or at least bunches of people scarfing down pizza near the entrance.. . As for the the pizza,  it's not like there are crazy weird toppings or anything.  It's just a plain and simple good pizza.  They are constantly baking them so they are coming out hot a fresh.  They are just under $5 a slice, which may seem like a lot, but they are large like Sbarro, but wayyyy better.  Keep in mind you are on the strip trying to get food.  They also sell beer on tap and soda too!  I love the white pizza, but I usually select whatever just came out of the oven, and haven't been disappointed yet.  . . Overall, it is something to experience once.  You feel like you a part of a secret club, secret pizza club that is.  I can almost guarantee that after trying it once you'll be back again.
Great place, worth searching. Don't expect the best pizza of your life. Expect amusement, great quality of pizza to go, but, unfortunately, inequal ratio price / quality die to the position and guerilla marketing around it.
Seems like every time I go to Vegas I end up at Secret Pizza. It could be months, even years, between Vegas trips and yet Secret Pizza is that go-to joint when you need great tasting grub that is cheap and will fill you up. Its especially the place to go late at night. . . First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.. . If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come. . . Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.. . Except that one time Joe Thornton from the San Jose Sharks was a douchebag and tried to cut everyone. Thats a story for another time.... . Tip: There's a nice spot with couches around a pool table where you can enjoy your pizza away from the cramped close quarters of this narrow pizza joint.
omgggg this place is my fave!!!!. . so bomb after a club! $5 slice, so worth the wait!!. . my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!. . it's pretty greasy though. this is the perfect place to go to for drunk munchies!!!. . must try!! :)
Although it's pretty much an open secret at this point, do not visit the cosmopolitan late at night without visiting secret pizza. It's greasy, delicious, and very satisfying. Just follow the drunk people up the escalator and look for the long hallway (and line).. . I happen to adore the white pizza and anything with mushrooms, but honestly  all the flavors look awesome. Yes, the prices are higher than the flyover state you might call home, but you will likely be tipsy and exhausted by the time you make it over so you won't mind.. . The very worst thing about this place is standing in line and watching what feels like an endless number of people walk past you with yummy slices. It will take a while if you are in the post club crowd. Don't expect a whole pizza either on a busy night- you could be looking at an hour wait or more (after you wait 30+ minutes in line).
I love that this place is hard to find! You have to go to the third floor, where all the restaurants are. Look around and find a long alleyway/corridor that is lined with framed pictures. This is your tunnel to a pizza haven. I had to ask someone where exactly it was when I saw her sitting by the pool table with a large, delicious looking pizza (as a tip, this is where you can sit when the pizza joint is filled with customers). Thankfully, I came in the afternoon so there was no line to wait in. As it was my first time, I decided to ask the workers for recommendations. We ended up getting a white pizza with mushroom and sausage, and a traditional red pizza with sausage. Both were delicious and satisfying - sometimes you just need a good slice of pizza as a break from all the rich, fine-dining type of food in Vegas. At first, I thought just one slice wouldn't be enough. But wash it down with an ice cold beer and you have yourself a meal. . . Prices were decent, $4 - 5 a slice depending on the amount of toppings you add. They have beer on draft too, which made the whole experience remind me of my undergraduate days. Overall, an excellent pizza joint for your afternoon, evening, and post-club munchie needs.
Great crust, but pretty greasy and on the expensive side.  Just a few stools for seating. Kind of cool location and atmosphere.
Thanks to Yelp for suggesting this pizza spot in Las Vegas. As others have said it is a little hard to find, but worth it. Very flavorful thin pizza for a decent price.  . . The spot is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino. It is to the right of the Japanese restaurant and has no signs. Best to order well in advance if you want carry out. . . The line for walk in guests could take a while.
I've never paid more than $1.50 for what I considered to be delicious pepperoni pizza (which is at costco) but Secret Pizza was recommendation from a friend for a quick lunch since I didn't want to eat fast food. This place does live up to its name since I had to ask two Cosmo employees to point me to the direction of this place; no signs or the name is not on the directory. The place is small and there is counter space for people to quickly eat their pizza but if you want to have conversation I would recommended just heading out right outside where there are couches and pool table to eat and enjoy your meal.. . Now onto the food, I first ordered the sausage and pepperoni and within the first bite I was hooked! What makes this great pizza is their crust, it has just right amount of texture between doughy and crunchy. Because of this I've been back 3 times within my 3-day in Vegas needless to say I'll be back!
Secret Pizza was one of the places we were looking forward to on our last trip because many people talk about it, and the reviews are awesome. It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo with other restaurants (I think it's the level with a pool table on it), down the hallway with all the pictures.. . There was no line and we were able to get our pizza right away. Each slice is preheated, and one of the disappointing things is that both of our slices were overly salty.  The slices were good, but no where near the hype. And not anywhere near the quality of an authentic slice from NY.  I think the slices were $5-7 each, and beer was $7-8.. . The service was OK and there is virtually no seating. The atmosphere is nice (arcade games, bar top seating, etc). But the pizza was just OK. We found the slice at Flour and Barley (at the Linq) was much better.
Yo this place is literally a secret: no signs, no logo anywhere and hidden in some random hallway I would have never known of if it weren't for yelp and countless hotel employees and strangers guiding me. It's on the 3rd floor right by the glass elevators. I did not realize it wasn't an actual restaurant which was so strange... But there's several seating areas nearby. . We ordered a whole pizza which is enormous beyond belief. Pepperoni and sausage pizza was 31 tax included. . Hands down THE best pizza I've ever had. Like, comparable to NY PIZZA GUYS. it was major salty though so if you're sensitive to that don't get either meat on your pizza lol. Overall it was a peculiar and delicious experience. We thought we would share our plentiful leftovers with some homeless people too
NOTHING HITS THE SPOT BETTER THAN A SLICE OF SECRET PIZZA AFTER MARQUEE!!. . The line may be long, and there may be shoe-less girls everywhere, but trust me, it is worth the wait. . . I think one thing for me is that this place reminds me of DC, when a night drinking in Adams Morgan always ends with a slice of Jumbo Slice Pizza. . . $5 dollar per slice is way more expensive than your normal Costco slice but there ain't nothing better after a night of fun. Plus, we already sweated and danced all the calories off at the club anyway. Why not indulge?
The definition of secret. It is hidden far down a random corridor in the Cosmopolitan and completely unmarked, so I can see how it is so easy to miss. What is the best way to find it? Track down the nearest person with a huge pizza box and ask them to direct you to the secret pizza parlor they just picked it up at. Trust me, it works wonders!. . The full pies are expensive, but definitely more economical than paying per slice. Also, when you are craving that chewy, gooey goodness at 3AM and all the pizza delivery boys have been asleep since 2AM, paying close to $30 for a pie is definitely worth every penny.. . It may be a bit of a wait (20-30 minutes) if you are custom ordering a pizza, but when you are stumbling back to your hotel room with that piping-hot fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza in your hands and everyone else is staring at you in jealousy, you won't even be mad.  . . The retro decor is tacky, but we're just there for the pizza right?
There is a long hallway to get in so it is definitely pretty secret. There is not much seating inside, about 6 seats. You have to wait for your pizza, atleast 20 minutes so I would call ahead. . . The pizza was alright, I honestly like Slices in Dublin, CA so much more. If I were in Las Vegas again I would not come by here but it was a nice expierence.
Thank you Secret Pizza for saving so many club goers lives.  After drinking and dancing the night away, one needs greasy pizza to save themselves from making bad choices.  After clubbing at Marquee, there is a super long line, just be patient, you'll make it to the front.  My pizza slice was very good, ate it like I haven't eaten before.. . What I like about this specific place, was the hallway of album covers.  Made the time pass by looking at them.  Great conversational pieces.
For a lactose-intolerant person to enjoy pizza... enough to suffer?!! That should tell you something about this place!. . Their sausage ricotta cheese pizza was SO GOOD! . . Late night eating after Marquee. . Line's kind of ridiculous but goes by fast.. Thin crust.
Location: 2nd FL of the Cosmo right next to China Poblano. Walk straight off the escalator, down the hallway of old school records.. . Love how they're open so late! We came here straight from our flight because we hadn't had dinner and it was a place that we wanted to try that was still open at 1:30AM on a Thurs. There's only about four stools inside so it's a take-out type of place. There are long couches outside by the elevators as well if you're lucky to grab a seat. . . Greasy food with yummy thin crispy crusts. They have pies on the counter and underneath as well, so if you wanted something that's not on top, just ask! I got here when there was a line nearly to the entrance of the hallway. After I got my slice, the line was gone! So timing's everything here. When I finally got my slices, I was so hungry that I forgot to pat down the slice with a napkin to take off the tons of extra oil. Oh well.. vacation! :D. . My order:. Slice of White Pie. Slice of Pepperoni & Mushroom. . I'm fairly partial to red sauces, so I enjoyed the simple pepperoni & mushroom more. Both were really good though.. . Note: If you're ordering a whole pizza, I highly suggest calling in because it'll take about 20min.
Hmm. I don't know if it's my taste buds... (& no, I have not been drinking - hubs thinks it's my taste buds) or what but this isn't as great as I expected it to be. . . We ordered a whole pepperoni $28.50. We were there at 6ish on a Tuesday. No line. . . The service was cool - not sure what the name of the super chill guy was who took our order or the gentleman who made our pizza but they were awesome. . . Mr. Order Taker looked at Mr. Pizza Maker and said "What, 20 min?" cook shook his head "Nah, 15!" Sweet! & sure enough 15 min later we had our pizza. . . They'll do 1/2 orders too - half white half what have you. . . Flavor: . . The Pepperoni used was SALTY and gave me this bitter after taste. It's weird.. It has a great flavor but the salty was too much. Or was it the cheese?  . . Can't taste the sauce. It's almost only there to keep the pizza from getting dry. I'm a big sauce person so this was a downer. Maybe next time we'll try to get extra sauce. . . Crust was good and.. Er.. Crusty. I love crust. I love carbs. . . So, overall... Eh. Buuuuut... I wasn't drunk. Maybe that's where I messed up? Hahaha. And I mean, like I said "next time" so, I'll come back & I'll try the white sauce. . . I give it a Three, my Hubs gives it a 4 - but he can get his own Yelp account =P
Delicious pizza can be found here if you can locate the place! I had the white, and a slice of regular cheese, and they were both fantastic! A bit hefty price-wise, which is the only reason I'm not marking it 5 stars, but still, some damn good pizza.
I am glad someone let me in on this secret. You have to go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan by the elevator. It's a little restaurant/pizza joint down a hall.  You see all these record covers on the wall leading into the place. So you get there and there are funny men behind the counter making pies and joking. It just puts you Ina relaxed mood and gets you ready for a slice. I am a pizza purest at hurt. Meaning I judge a pizza place by a simple cheese slice. If that is executed well it's a good sign of what's to come. So I ordered cheese and pepperoni.  Did I need two slices? NOPE... I am miss piggy so I had to get them. The cheese pizza was right up my alley. The thin crust with a decent amount of cheese and sauce ratio. You take your slice and sit on one of three few stools they have or you stand. Still you don't mind because that big slice of pizza is smiling at you. You have to smile back. Another spot that will be a Vegas staple to visit.
sooo good! We got there at 3 am something the line was so long. About 30 mins in we are getting antsy and saying maybe we should leave is it really worth waiting this long? It better be worth it! Next thing we know people start walking by with whole pies opening their boxes wafting the smell in to our faces saying oh yeah it's worth the wait. I think maybe an hour later or longer even, we finally got our pizza. We were starving at this point and ordered a whole pie. Half white and half pep and olive. We walk back down the hallway and everyone is cat calling our pizza. I felt a little guilty because I knew how long those people have to wait but not guilty enough I just kept it walking with my pizza ;) the white pizza is amazing!! I honestly never cared for ricotta but I don't know if it was the alcohol it just tasted amazing the dough is perfect. I was worried because some friends had it their 1st night here and said it was too greasy. I did not have that problem at all or maybe I can handle the grease a little more. The white pizza was absolute perfection.
So I was referred to this so called "Hidden" or "Secret" pizza place in the Cosmo.  I will say that I actually enjoyed the pizza here.  However, the lines are slow and the workers are inefficient.  There are like 2 people working hard while 3-4 workers stand around and talk story.. . Anyway we got the NY Style slice with Meatball and Pepperoni.  It had a nice flavor.  The tomato sauce wasn't overpowering.  It has a nice taste.  And the meatball and pepperoni worked well with the sauce, cheese, and crust.. . We also had the Detroit Style Square slice with cheese and tomato sauce.  The crust was nice and also had good flavor.. . Overall this is a really good place to get pizza.  But at the end of the day pizza is just pizza, it's just some toppings on a piece of bread.  I don't really get too excited over it.  But it's pretty good nonetheless....
It was almost $100 for 2 pizzas but it was absolutely awesome!  Absolutely worth the wait (and be ready to stand in line).  No place to eat there (some couches outside in an open area of the Cosmo).. . This is so worth it!
My fave pizza spot in Vegas. It is bomb  when I'm hammered.
Awesome pizza, just like home, especially the Sicilian.  Lots of toppings, and the dough was agood 2 inches thick. Well worth the wait.
