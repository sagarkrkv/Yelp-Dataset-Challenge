This place is dope. Bartender Julie made a custom cocktail for my wife which was a tequila/St. Germain drink. The music was fantastic, great service, fun nightlife atmosphere in an awesome club.
Watch out for the bouncers. Not at all safe for girls. They are more thirsty than other guys in the club and would take any chance to stare, grab or grope the girls. They are probably under the impression of being some kind of vigilante police force. You can find plenty of stories in other reviews although interestingly most of the 5 star reviews here are by the staff/promoters of the club. I don't expect a promoter to promote by writing bad reviews of the club. . Despite being multi floor and covering a lot of area the club's main dance floor has only space for about 50 people at a time and security guys won't let you stand anywhere but that doesn't stop the management to keep letting people in. . Another advise, don't let the security get away by forcefully searching you without your consent or take you any back room. You can claim wrongful imprisonment, wrongful search without warrant/authority and you can bring a civil case against them.
We were less than welcomed at the door. The security guard was extremely disrespectful. We would not have gone in if our birthday bud didn't insist.
Marquee nightclub is located in the best location with the greatest views. We went on Halloween weekend and didn't have to wait too long. Drinks are average ... $14 for ciroc + cranberry.. . Ps. There's no ciroc peach in the city :(. . However, the music wasn't my cup of tea. I was excited over the rave reviews about their "hip hop" room but it wasn't what I expected. The DJ was spinning young joc & lil Jon tracks and then jumped into music from the bay. Maybe, it's because I'm from NY and I'm use to hearing relevant music.. . But regardless it's a dope spot. It's huge, it's beautiful, the people are nice.. 3 stars.
Went here on Aug 3 for my bday for my bday to see Kaskade. We had pre-purchased our tickets so we went right in and avoided the massive crowd outside. Professional and friendly staff. Great setting and atmosphere and views. I would highly recommend this place of you want to party or celebrate your bday.
Gah, the night club is alright.  got in for free due to our hookups with promoters at TAO.. . came here on a friday night, there were some non-EDMish hip-hop-like beats with no words on the outside. . when the DJ comes they close the outside and every crowds on the inside where its just blasting bass and everyone is standing there fist pumping.  prepare to have your eardrums blown out. . there are tons of asian uncles and sweaty curly haired guys here, prepare to get creeped on and have drinks spilled all over your feet. . wear platforms because all the confetti piles up and gets mixed with alcohol and grime and stick to your feet if you are wearing some open toed shoes. . definitely liked Tao better
I visited Marquee recently and was surprised by the amazing format. The layout of the venue itself is amazing. The best part is having both the indoor and outdoor section of the club making things different than most clubs in Vegas. Overall This venue is a must see as they throw a great party.
I'm paying $620 for my room for the night and they charge $20 per person extra to go to this pool. . . We paid to see that it was all about and it was so not worth it. In fact we walked out after 10 minutes and asked for our $60 cover charge back. Then had to wait another 20 mins to get our money back. . . They make you go through about 4 sets of security more than the airport. Each one had a ruder staff member who seemed to have his owe person rules in getting in. The last one was trying to tell me that I could not bring my purse in. Then finally acted as if he was doing me a huge favor by letting me bring my purse. . . When we finally got to the pool after about 30 mins of bs, we found out that if we wanted a place to sit we had to pay extra money as all seats are reserved so we were told that we had to sit on the 100 degree concrete. . . At that point we walked out.
They fill this place in past max capacity where itliterally is like walking on top of another person just to get anywhere. Even to get back in from outside you have to wait in another line because they have to wait for people to exit first. These people need to be more about customer service instead of money hungry thieves.
MY FAVORITE night club in Las Vegas! I have only been at night (a few times), so I have nothing to speak to regarding the day club except for that fact that it has to be just as awesome, if not more awesome (since you can swim). They don't allow you to get near the pools when it is a nightclub, so don't try or else you'll get thrown out (have seen this happen). If you have a suite in The Cosmo, your balcony will lead straight to this club.. . Marquee is located in The Cosmo (Cosmopolitan) and right in the center of the strip (next to Bellagio and the Monte Carlo). Great location! This place is SO BIG and has MANY LEVELS/AREAS, but despite this fact, it is always busy. Busy in the GOOD WAY. Not busy to where you can't move without touching someone. (Ew!). . Great DJs, awesome music, fun atmosphere, variety of levels/areas to appeal to many tastes, plenty of bars, and all the good stuff. There is a bar called The Library, on the bottom floor. It's more quite there and intimate so if you don't really like clubs but your friends do, this is a good place to retire to. It's a bar inside a club, as I said appeals to all tastes.. . My girls and I got in for free because I know a host and had open bar for an hour. BUT I have known people to have trouble getting in. When we leave, there is usually still a line of people trying to get in. For guys, I know you have a better chance of getting in if you have a bunch of girls with you. But this is true of every where else in Vegas.
We were on the guestlist for Kaskade so we got in free. I've been to a lot of the clubs on the strip and thought this one was poorly designed and small. We had to climb quite a few flights of stairs through the fire escape stairwell which was not fun in our six inch heels. You enter in and have to walk through a small walkway in the shape of a half moon. When you get to the middle you're able to exit into a bigger area that lets out to the pool where the day club takes place. When the club gets packed it's a traffic control nightmare. You literally have to push your way through a cramped crowd to get in, out or around to get to the bar, bathrooms, or exit. If you're claustrophobic don't even think of going here. . .     I didn't enjoy the opening DJ's set and that put me off for Kaskade. DJ Lema stuck with the same B.P.M's his whole set which I found boring. I've been to every Insomniac event and listen to countless EDM  podcasts and found his set to lack creative transitions and sampling/mixing. Even with the awesome screens and visuals it did nothing for me. At one point I thought they changed D.J's because I saw no one managing the laptop or mixing for a good three minutes which lead me to believe his set was pre-recorded. . .     The club itself reminded me of a mini-scale version of XS and I left the main room to go elsewhere before Kaskade came on. On the way out we found the hip-hop room and wish we'd went there first because it was a good time but super crowded. My suggestion is to find the hip-hop room first before hitting the main floor.
It has been nothing but a pleasure working with CJ Hilbert. I booked through him for a girls weekend back in July, but I'm coming back this weekend for my birthday and I have a dosage of dudes in the group. So many promoters get upset or nasty when you bring guys to Vegas, since it's an inconvenience to them. CJ has been so incredibly professional and accommodating throughout the entire process. . . I sent him an itinerary of what I'd love to do for my birthday weekend, which of course includes all the top day and night clubs, and he didn't even flinch. He is able to make magic happen! He is super communicative which I know is hard as he has a strong following. . . Thank you CJ for all of your help. I don't think I'll ever book with anyone else.
Best club I've been to in Vegas---probably the best I've been to EVER.. . Hip hop room is small but they play some good oldies (rap/hiphop) that I never knew I missed so much.. . Their light installation in the EDM room is AMAZING. . . Notes:. * Large outdoor area WITH gambling tables (wahhhhhttt?????). * EDM room lights are mesmerizing. * Drinks are expensive, but where is it not in vegas?. * Bring folding flats. Thank me later.
If you're looking for a Jersey Shore douche party featuring DJ Suck, then this is your joint. But that's just your typical day club atmosphere and not why I rated this pool so low.. . First of all, this place is FILTHY. We walked in and the whole place smelled like urine and drunken desperation. We had a cabana and the little carpet inside was sticky under our feet. The daybed attached to our cabana was lined with towels but they were all stanky and full of questionable stains. Like, seriously? A $1500 cabana and the staff can't change the towels on the day bed? And I cannot convey enough how disgusting the pool was. The water was thick and soupy with random floating debris and hair floating everywhere. It looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a month. I stepped in up to my shins and it was at that point I decided that fully submerging in that sewer water would surely result in a staph infection or pregnancy. I got out and had long ass hair stuck to my foot. I was, and still am, totally grossed out.. . The food we ordered was very good but the staff wasn't super attentive. Again, for a$1500 cabana with auto grat, the service should have been stellar. It was getting to the point where I wanted to put a little bell around my server's neck. . . Seriously. When I dress up, wait in line, deal with the cockbag doormen, and pay a million dollars for food and drinks, I expect a clean cabana, attentive service and pool water that isn't an eleven on a scale of 1 to Erin Brockovich.
I have one word. One word to warn you with. One word to make you understand the dilemma. STAIRS!!!!! . . What in the mind fu@k of Vegas was someone thinking when they built this?!? Never Have I never had to climb 6 flights of stairs to reach the dance floor. Never have I ever had to almost kill myself while wearing (might i add super cute) stiletto heels walking metal staircases!!! METAL STAIRCASES. NOT ONE. BUT LIKE 60!!!! . . Who decided that a labyrinth of Stairs was a fabulous idea with thousands of drunken Vegas patrons!!! Never ever will I ever go back to this monstrosity.
I came here with a couple of "race" friends. I asked the guys letting us in what the waiting about 20 minutes in the front of the line problem was. They said we are trying to figure it out... I asked them multiple times what the problem was ...and they said we are trying to figure it out..... I will never go to Marquee again...They let multiple white girls in front of us.... They never let us in and I am a beautiful white woman with a couple of african-American friends. They definitely thought we were up to something.... Because of my friends' race. I am not happy and I will always talk shit on this place. I will never go here ever again .... I talked to the cops right next to the class... And they said they have the right to refuse anybody. WOW!!! Never go to COSMOPOLITAN.
If you want to get screwed over make a reservation with "TAVO". I have been to most of the biggest clubs in the country and never have I came across someone so unprofessional. Booked a cabana 3 months in advance. Our main reason for coming to vegas. We get there by 11am to wait in a hour table reservation line. Get to the front they check my name off the list take my id comes back 20min later to say sorry we dont have your cabana anymore. The minimum that was given to you was to low. I say no problem we plan to spend 10k what can you give us. They couldt even give us a daybed outside. Worst experience ever.  Best part was the hotel gave me his contact.
For nightclub only: . . This space is huge! And be prepared to climb a numerous amount of stairs... The main stage area is very large and always a mosh when the big DJ's are in town. One for the best parts about this space is that they open up the outside area where the dayclub is. So you can meander around out there is you need some fresh air. . . But my favorite part is 'the library', a secret room upstairs with a private bar, seating, and a pool table! That is our designated spot every time we go to Marquee. And this year they had large screens so we could watch Kascade spin, the perfect setup! . . They also have gambling tables outside so there is a little bit of everything going on. But don't forget to hit up Secret Pizza when you leave! (located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo... just follow your nose).
Where to start Marquee?  Let's start that it's better to get your tickets online (women $20, men $50), rather than wait in a very long line and possibly not make it in.  Now that you are in, what to do?  Well, you climb stairs of course.  I'm finding this is a theme for many of the clubs, Marquee isn't the only one....Hakkasan!!!. . What I did like about this club was the different rooms you can pick and choose from.  They had the main EDM room with your special guest DJ, other room has hip hop, top floor is the library room, pumping out the live EDM music, and the outside patio area with gambling dealers wearing bra tops.  Only in Vegas.. . Bathrooms are a little hard to find, but once you do, overall clean.  They are located outside past the gambling tables.. . If you enjoy going to a club, check it out.  Just be warned that we were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  While walking the main EDM floor, Kaskade decides it's time to come on, thanks Kaskade...not!  We got swarmed by tons of people.  I couldn't move or breath, I was on the verge of passing out.  Try to stay away from the middle when the main talent goes on.  We didn't know???  Never again.  Once we were able to crawl our way out of that, I enjoyed the club so much more.
We waited in line for 2 hours even though we had a table reserved.  Need I say more?
We went to Marquee both at night and for the day party. Both times we were on the guest list and got to jump in front of the line. They have great music blasting and so many people. This is the place to be if you want to be seen. Be aware that for the pool party you cannot bring anything in with you unless you have a cabana. You rent lockers downstairs for $20 and even have to leave your purse there. They do have towels provided for you so we just carried our credit cards and sunscreen in with us. It didn't make for a fun start, neither did the 20 minute line to get a drink. I get that this is Vegas, but I've done other pool parties and been treated better.
Marquee disappointed me a little on my most recent visit. I've now been to Marquee nightclub three times. The security irritated me - asking me to move a couple of times for no apparent reason. The DJ on a Monday (08/25/14) was solid. I thought there were a couple of really long pauses in the music that needed to be tightened up. ...Despite being on a guest-list with text confirming such, there was confusion about which line I was to be in. One host took me out of line and placed me outside the roped off area and asked me to try to get the attention of a very busy fellow host. I was passed from three different hosts before being taken care of. I did not feel like a "guest".
Marquee is my second favorite club in Vegas. There really aren't many downsides to this club, Marquee has all the things you would expect from a club.. . Getting to Marquee proved a little confusing because the club entrance isn't located on the first floor like most other clubs. However, on your way up to Marquee, you get to see all the pretty decorations the Cosmo has to offer. You can even stop to take a photo by the dangling crystal light fixtures. When we arrived to the club, we were directed to to the guestlist line. Another plus is how quickly the security guards let you into the club if you are on the guestlist, unlike Hakkasan, who made us wait an hour to get inside.. . Once inside, you take an elevator up to the main floor where the headliner DJ begins to perform around 1:00 - 1:30 AM. From here you can either continue to the back of the club which leads to the outside rooftop area or down the stairs to the hip-hop floor. . . The hip-hop floor is small themed. It has a small bar and a good sound system, but a terribly small dance floor. There are also a few small tables surrounding the floor.. . As for the outside pool area, it is pretty relaxed because it is not as packed and stuffy compared to being inside any club in general. The outside has pretty palm trees and a great rooftop view of the Vegas lights and buildings. This is also where their day club occurs. There is another DJ here so the cabanas and tables outside have music. . . The main dance floor is not terribly small, but it is not big either. When it gets packed (around 1 AM, sometimes maybe earlier) they do not allow you on the dance floor. I walked over to a side entrance and just made my way to the dance floor anyways.. . Overall, Marquee is a great club with three musically different areas. They have great views and they offer areas to sit for anyone suffering from sore feet. And their security aren't pushy like those at Hakkasan. I love the light sticks they have and the DJs they have here as well! The only thing that this club could do differently is the location of their bathrooms, one is located outside near the pool area and the another is outside on the hip-hop floor. It is a journey to get to one of these bathrooms from the main dance floor.
I've been to Marquee 3 times.  Each time, I had hopes it would top the previous one.  Marquee does attract famous Djs every weekend.  Best advice is to get your ticket online and come here early as with any other major club in Vegas.  If not, you could give a bouncer some cash.  My friend and I thought we were out of luck with no online ticket, no guestlist, and not staying at Cosmo.  But the bouncer casually asked us to give him cash and we would get in without issue.  AND it worked! . . Two dance floors.  The major one is for EDM and the smaller one is for hip pop.  Both are nearly impossible to move around when packed.  The outside pool area is pretty nice but once its crowded, it's not so fun.  The visuals and the effects at the main dance floor is pretty nuts.  Now the layout of the venue is top floor pool and main EDM stage and then lower floor is the smaller hip pop room and a secluded bar.  Pretty simple right?  Add in a little Jack Daniels, or Grey Goose and now you are in a maze.  Cost of drinks?  $$$$ The same as XS, or Hakkasan.  . . If you are coming for your favorite DJ, yeah come to Marquee.  I'm more interested in a large spaced venue with a good crowd.  I might have to bump Hakkasan up a star due to this review.
