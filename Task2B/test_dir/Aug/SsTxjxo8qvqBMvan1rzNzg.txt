I absolutely loved my visit here! However, my rating is more for the ambiance and experience rather than the food. . This is old school Vegas with all it's gaudy lights and style. The fireside pit was definitely a place I feel I can get Day Drunk at. The fireside pit was separated from the main restaurant. If you installed a few poles and threw in some strippers, it will look EXACTLY like a strip club. It's dark and the seats were definitely strip club-esque. . . Anyhow, we ordered this fishbowl drink (supposedly their signature drink) that we saw being served at another table while waiting for our table at the fireside pit. It was about 18 dollars and enough for 2 people to share because it was huge. It was also quite a tasty drink. Thumbs up.. . We also split an omelet, which came with a side of hash browns. Both were decent. Nothing particularly good or bad to say here. . . The reason I'm such a fan is the fact that it's open 24 hours, the old school Vegas feel, and a photographer even came by to take our picture and print out a free postcard for us!
A very interesting place to hang out. Good happy hour specials and fire pit seating is cool. Has a serious strip club vibe without the strippers, not sure if it's super cool or creepy, either way, it is worth checking out for sure, just to say you've been there
The food was terrible, arrived cold, and was nothing like the sister restaurant in Reno. I don't understand. Cafe Milano in Peppermill Hotel was so good. This was... well terrible!. . The service was slow, out food was over salted and arrived cold, and we just hated it. Not coming back!
This seems to be a local touristy spot for diner food at the end of the strip. We hit it up and had a great time. The food was fantastic and we had great service too. It was a unique place with an outstanding menu and friendly staff.
The interior is Gaudy and reminds me being in some strip bar but it is so Las Vegas! The food was good, but not the best. The portions were huge and the service great! The prices were a little but by the looks of the place being full......I guess people are willing to pay.
Real american restaurant with dressed up waitresses. . The lady that advised the wine was classy.. The waitress  also gave good recommendation.. But the food was terrible.. Greasy, fries served cold, too much sauce on everything. . Definitely a place that Europeans should avoid.
Grrrrrrrreat breakfast. It was our first time, ever, there and the service and food was fantastic.
We have been coming here since our college days of weekend trips to Vegas,  a good stop before your long road back to LA on the 15.  Came back last week for some breakfast before our flight back to San Diego...Great variety on the menu still, huge portions as usual and good fast food with good friendly service. Had the blueberry pancakes, too much to finish, hubby had eggs and turkey sausage....good job, how about smaller portions with appropriate costs next time....we had no room for doggy bags on this trip.
It's one of the few classics that doesn't fade away. I just had the pastrami sandwich the other day and it was excellent! I have not had a good pastrami sandwich since Old Ebbitt's Grill in Washington, DC. This sandwich was pretty darn close. On top of the one of a kind decor, Elvis was having lunch at the same time! This place is still top notch!
Went twice while I was in town last. No regrets because the portions were stupid and the food greasy. This place is the quintessential breakfast experience of Vegas and everyone who's been in this town more than 5 years knows it. I'm lucky as I happened to be hanging with people who knew this town in and out. . . Did a chicken fried steak in the morning. It was huge. Diet be damned. . . Amazing place to hit up after night of drinking. 10/10 get drunk, stumble here and regret the food later. But don't regret. . . Not Vegas extravagant, more just glutton extravagant.
If you're staying in Vegas, or live here and are out on the town, forget everything you think you know about late night/early morning drunk breakfast. IHOP - haha, forget about it. Denny's - gross. Peppermill Lounge - perfect. When you walk in the lighting and decorations will make you happy, it's like an 80's night club with trees. Every member of the staff was friendly and patient. The food was perfect for the moment, yummy stuff. I got the Joes San Fran Special, which was filling and delicious. The prices are just right and the timing of the whole meal was on point. This should be the after after party spot for all club goers! Trust me , read my other reviews, I'm legit. ;) . Done
5 of us.  Bill $101 (tip not included).  BELOW average diner food.  WAY, way below average.  Arrived Friday morning at 11am.  30 minute wait.  Super busy.  Neon everywhere.  Cool exterior, we were pumped and ready to eat!  service was efficient.  Most of us got breakfast, and only one got a sandwich.  All the breakfast food (hashbrowns, omelettes, chicken friend steak) was just blah blah blah.  Sure, larger portions, but NOTHING was amazing or above average.  I can't stress enough how BELOW average their food was.  Not worth the wait.  Not worth the energy.  Staff even got mad for two of our group smoking in the "fire lane" -- they were standing NOT in a car.  WEIRD.  where are you supposed to smoke during a 30 minute wait?  will never be back.  why is this place soooooo popular I'll never understand.
Wow, I remember a time not so long ago (well into the 1990's) when "Steak and eggs on-demand 24 x  7, $5.95" was synonymous with Las Vegas and partaking of such fare at the Flamingo, the Stardust, and the real Vegas casinos was an essential part of the Vegas experience.  Fast forward-ing to Steve Wynn's Vegas of 2014 can be dismally unsettling and attempting to get ANY real dinner past 10PM will end up being a disappointing if not downright depressing quest.  Pretty ironic given the shows let out between 10-11.  Enter Peppermill..  Best thing I ever did was ask my cab driver where to get a steak dinner after a show at the Westgate, he dropped us off at Peppermill and stepped into the Vegas I know and love.  The food, full steak dinner, fabulous ambience, and the place was packed with like-minded late-night eaters.  I remember Peppermill from Santa Clara of the mid 1990's - I hear it's gone - it was the same place as this, though randomly placed across Intel, HP, AMD buildings- an oasis/breath of fresh air amid a rapidly developed Silicon Valley locus, same vibe, same neon, all good....
The best hot wings and curly fries on this side of the Mississippi!!!! It was amazing grace!!!! I'm from TN and was visiting and I will be back next month!!!!!!
The service was good. The food was good and you get very large portions. I ordered the turkey burger which was the biggest one I've ever seen and the sweet potato fries that come with it were enough for 4 people. The price was decent for all that food.
Fun place!. . We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday. . . We had a friend staying at the Wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the Wynn restaurants. None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.. . The decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!. . I can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.. . We had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.. . On the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)
I love this place, it's my 4th time here and it's kinda become a tradition to eat lunch before heading back into LA. All the servers and cocktail servers are pleasant. While waiting for our table we went into the lounge and had cocktails by the fire pit. Best Bloody Mary in town, honestly!. We loved our lunch today. Corned beef hash was amazing. I don't remember the lady's name who was our server, she had blonde hair, probably in her 50's? She was awesome.
This place is a Vegas cultural icon! Has been open since the 70s and I hope it doesn't change !!I have to say that the quality of the food certainly hasn't changed I have the French toast collage which consists of eggs sausage on four pieces of French toast and the serving for enough for two people it was delicious the French toast was golden and crispy on the outside the scrambled eggs were so fluffy and the sausage is the biggest I've ever seen! No matter what time of day I go the place is always packed!! You must come here instead of the basic casino cafe.
Would have been 5 stars, but it took too long to get a drink. They have separate servers for cocktails, and we had to ask 3 times before one came to our table.. . Food is EXCELLENT and servings are HUGE!!!. . Decor is perfectly gaudy....lots of neon and fake plants!. . This is a favorite of mine in Vegas!
This place has become my go to breakfast stop coming in, while in, and/or about to leave town. I was very impressed with Munch's breakfast. The linguica they use is one of the best I've tasted. My scrambled eggs done to perfection. The hostess and my server (#36, haha) are friendly. I need to keep going back until I cover the menu.
A great place for all appetites.  With a full bar for the adult eaters.
Wow! Just like its twin in Reno, the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge in Las Vegas is Heaven on Earth!  WOW! What AMAZING, "old school" customer service!!!!!!! Two thumbs WAY up to James, Marilena, Alyce, Brigitte, Ruthie and Diana!!!!!!! You guys treated us like we were whales!  Please Mr. Peppermill: Give them all a big, fat raise! They more than deserve it!  Oh and by the way, we'll be back!!!!!!
I didn't know what to expect when my boyfriend drove up to Peppermill but he assured me it was amazing food (my first trip to Vegas but he goes once a year). He was completely right!  The look when you walk in is what one thinks of when thinking about Vegas with neon everywhere, but the food was the best while there & we hit some nice places. The entire menu is available morning or night. I highly recommend their eggs Benedict but everything looked good & my boyfriend said he has never had a bad meal there.  It's on the strip but not in a casino which is a plus too. Definitely worth checking out!
Great food at good prices. Excellent decor, it's definitely unique. Awesome coffee for you java lovers.
Cool looking spot inside.  Food is good. Price is right! The French Toast was delicious.
Drinks in lounge are great. Always a good choice . Best after hours grub. Can't beat the taste early in the morning after being out all night . It's a classic
The good and the bad of this place  (read to end to hear the good). The decor is typical over the top Vegas. Even though the exterior does not look like it. Quick service at first, but that is where that stopped. Once our food came,it was hard to find our waitress. We saw more of the photographer hacking snapshots on cheap postcards. (If I wanted a photo of myself here, I would take a selfie). What bothered me most is the pricing. Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving. And once again no response, not even a "I'm sorry to hear that". She just rolled her eyes.  My vote next time. Save a couple of bucks and eat next door at Denny's.
Ate here for breakfast with my boyfriend. It was our last day in Vegas. I was at first iffy about the place but I'm glad my boyfriend convinced me to try this place. Food was very good & the quality of the food made it taste more better. We had a great server too. Very nosy and loud atmosphere but despite the noise, overall the food was delicious.
August 3, 2014. . Peppermill, I have heard of you and I have been told that you serve the best breakfast food. And now, finally, I was able to experience you first hand. And here I my verdict, Peppermill- I am in love with you. I'm in live with your Eggs Benedict and your rainbow sugar! Why oh why do you do this to me? Why do you have to be hundreds of miles away from me? Why, oh why is it only when I crave you, that I have to drive 4 hours away to see you- to taste you? . . Oh how my heart breaks, how my heart aches for you. . . ::end scene::
The Peppermill is one big ball of happy. Everything about it makes me giddy. It's neon and pink. There are fake cherry blossom trees and blue velvet chairs and booths. There is a photographer that comes around to the tables and you get a postcard of the photo at the end of your meal (you also have the option of purchasing a larger,  cardboard framed version).  There's rainbow sugar on the table. . . I have been to the Peppermill several times.  I started just going to the Fireside Lounge,  but on the last few trips,  I've eaten at the diner too.  The food is really good and very reasonably priced for the Las Vegas Strip.  Last time I was there, I had a spinach omelete,  which was giant and delicious.  The pancakes and hashbrowns were also tasty. . . The Peppermill is a must see when you are in Vegas. The Fireside Lounge next door is beyond kitschy and has all kinds of tropical drinks,  even some non-alcoholic ones. They serve honey roasted peanuts and play ridiculous music videos.  If there's a wait for a table at the diner,  take a seat at the bar and wait while sipping a Zombie or virgin Pina Colada.
This is a fun colorful restaurant. If u like breakfast food, they have a lot of choices.
L O V E THIS PLACE! My go to spot every time I am in Vegas.
Awesome,  cool 64 ounce drinks by a retro fireplace followed by chicken fried steak with a sunny side egg on it with a jumbo fruit plate under a fake tree. Don't ask, just do it.
Sooo this place has a wide variety of food and great cooks.  BUT some of the waitresses are not sanitary when handling the food.  I went in for breakfast and at least 3 waitresses touched the customer's bread without gloves and none of them washed their hands.
3 Stars because our hostess was rude and...read below. . This was our first time here. We walk in. No hostess at the stand. 2 of them talking amongst each other arguing... what were they arguing about? They were arguing about which one of them was going to seat us. We can here them. "Its your turn!" ... "No, its your turn!" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe. My wife ask them..."Should we just seatourselves?" The hispanic looking one acts like she didnt see us.. "Oh im sorry, how many in your party?". Finally seated. Our waiter, waitress and another guy was really nice.. no problems with them or the food. . . So half way through our food a family shows up. Ok cool, cute kids. A few minutes pass by, kids know everyone there. They walk in the back as they please. I see another waitress holding a baby trying to put it to sleep. I know this is a place of business, a restaurant business not a day care. It looked very unprofessional. . . As im paying the bill (have to take the tab by the entrance) and there are slot machines. More kids and they're sitting in front of the slot machines. Some climbing on the chairs. I thought it was illegal to have kids sitting at any slot machine inside any place of business if they're underage (trust me the kids weren't older than 7 yrs old).. . Great portioned sized food. Fairly priced. Just not somewhere I think I'll eat again. . . I dont know,  just my observations.  They'll be closed the first week of Sept 2014.
