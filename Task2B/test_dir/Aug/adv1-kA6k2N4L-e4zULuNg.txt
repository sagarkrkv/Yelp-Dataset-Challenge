If you are looking for a tourist trap, this is it.  This is the old Vegas where paddlers and old folks hang out.  There are a couple of really ill equipped and unfriendly street bars here, so if you want to walk and get drunk with Elvis impersonator then go right ahead.
Work a visit, at night! Lots of fun! Happen to stumble in during first Friday, it was really crowded, no kids on first fridays, old coin slots and staff was actuallysuper nice, until the strip where there's aggressive sales people everywhere.
Less rowdier than the strip but at the same time, it was rowdy enough. There were concerts setup and that was entertaining as we walked pass. Girls dancing on bars? yep. They played a show or concert on the LED screens on top and everyone literally just stopped and watched. I didn't get to do the zip line this time but I will next. Overall, it's just a good hangout spot if you are in the area.
best people watching in my life ever!
Old Vegas is definably something to check out while you are in Vegas. Fremont street is a great time on a Friday or Saturday night and you can find great drink specials inside the casinos. The Golden Nugget has the best breakfast buffet in all of Vegas, in my opinion. There are also free concerts held here as well. They had POD, Lit and Papa Roach perform on July 4th. It was awesome.
Amazing night!! Live music, tons of great drinks/food. I got matching bracelet at "name in rice" the Asian looking guy there was so nice and pleasant to talk to though it was hard to hear through the loud music. Fried fair food for cheap!! Fried twinkles for 99 cents. Can't get better than that (; also, they have tons of little shops for souvenirs to take home. One of the performers " visual art " they are spray paint painters does amazing!!!! Scenery pieces. I'm definitely going to go back and buy one tonight!
I suppose this is what people go to Vegas for. It's an interesting concept...sort of like a midway for adults...lots of gift stores (no need to mention that they are tacky...that's a given)...places to buy alcohol...and walk under a covered street with lights and loud music. It's crowded, but all in all, it helps set the experience.
Too much fun..although I had my young kids with me.it was fun .took a pic with drunk santa..going back for sure with the kiddos..lots of drunk people
It's a nice stroll downtown to walk from the Plaza all the way down to Freemont East.  Its like taking a trip back to classic Vegas.  With all the lights, music, and night life, this small version of the strip gets crowded on the weekends and there are free concerts and entertainment all within a few blocks.  The drinks, food, and hotels are within reasonable price here compared to the strip on Las Vegas Boulevard.
Came here on a Friday night about 11 i was highly disappointed. Hence the 2 stars who should be more for the bartenders since they give you a show! Since you cant take your own drinks! Local say this changed about 3 months ago. I thought it would be a lot bigger, if your familiar with Venice beach jn cali then pretty much this is it super drunk ppl you can tell most of the also on drugs, around every corner was someone looking for a fight, saw 2 passed out ppl one who most definitely will remember vegas since from the looks of it broke his nose and slit open his forehead. Just definitely not what i expected at all for the price we paid to get there from the strip either. Also everyone who "works" on it is in a thong or titties out! Looked like a freak show out there! Either way yes it was a experience most likely ill never forget, but i also wouldn't go back!
This is an iconic visit in Vegas. There was street/lot parking nearby within walking distance. You get to see the casinos of the "Old Vegas" which is really cool. There are lots of celebrity impersonators, some of which looked like the real thing! Music plays live at two different stages. The lights are all so amazing and the ceiling is filled with visual light art. We came here with our family just to check it out. Granted-- you need to be comfortable with all types of things. There are several almost nude people walking around, and unless you are ok with that, you may be a bit shocked--but then again--you are in Las Vegas. Must see.
