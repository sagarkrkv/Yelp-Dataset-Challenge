Best karaoke bar in vegas. Try the stout. It's delicious.
On the menus it said "best brewery in Nevada by the Nevada Brewing Association" or something similar. I believe it, the Heff was amazing! . . The rest of the food was 5 stars as well, only overall the atmosphere was meh and casino-y. . . Our group ordered the no-carb chicken, fish and chips (2), a side of baked potato, and two sides of coleslaw. Every single dish was top quality, as good as the best of any you've had. Baked potato was perfectly cooked, and the others' dishes were large-portioned and delicious. Everyone was sharing. . . Even the waitress was super friendly and didn't talk too much, she seemed experienced and no-fuss. . . The only downside was that we walked from the Strip, and it was farther than it seemed!!
Pretty good fare for pretty great prices. Nothing to really write home about, but the portions are wonderfully huge. Got the ham and eggs breakfast for, I believe 6.99, and the ham steak covered almost the entire plate! Good portion of eggs, lots of potatoes and great toast. Hubby had the Reuben special and said it was amazing! . . Over all, the place was small, the casino was kind of sleazy, but the food was good. A short walk from the middle of the strip, so not bad at all! They serve a 24/7 breakfast menu (that is limited) but I hear you can't get that on the strip anywhere really.. . $20 for "brunch"-me breakfst, him lunch. Can't beat that.
Fun fun fun!. . I always wondered where karaoke was in Vegas, and now I know!  There is a large selection of songs which is nice.  Their cocktails are STRONG, good news folks!. . We ate at the cafe part, accidentally thinking it was the BBQ area which is where we intended to eat, but that didn't mean the food was bad, it was delicious.  The staff was friendly and the ambience was very kick back and relaxed, not too terribly dive-y.  I was told this was a dive bar so I was definitely expecting more dive, teehee. . . My biggest critique was that the song book was arranged by song title, not artist.  However that's a personal preference.  I'd totally go back here.
I had come to EI a few years before and loved it. The charm wore off. . .   What I didn't like:. .  1. It looked run down, maybe a little bit dirty. .  2. The food was right from the freezer into the fryer. I had some shrimp thing and a heavily salted French dip. It was cheap, but sat in my stomach for the rest of the day. . 3. They were running some scam where if you joined the players club and played a dollar you got free play or something. After jumping through a few hoops and completing the requirements I was told I wasn't eligible because I had signed up a few years previously. They couldn't tell me that before I completed the requirements for some reason. . 4. When I tried to get the rest of my $$ out of the machine it wouldn't work and I had to wait 20 minutes while they called maintenance to get it out. . 5. A waitress was complaining loudly about having been robbed by a patron earlier in the day. Made me feel great about being there.
Forget the steak, it's about the prime rib.  For ~$14, you get a good size prime rib, choice of potato, and veggies.  The prime rib was flavorful and not overly salty, the green beans were hecka tasty (might be some of the best I've had in a long while), and the steak fries were a little too pale for my taste.  The steak and shrimp (~$12) was edible, but definitely not the highlight of my meal.  Standard stuff I get when I go to Denny's or similar establishments.  BTW, the steak special everyone on Yelp raves about was not on the menu - well, at least I didn't see it.. . Other important info: The steak and prime rib can be found in the CAFE side and not the BBQ side, the service was too painfully slow (50 mins to get my food), tables are really close together, and apparently theyhave special root beer which is not listed under their soda section and costs more than soda.
First time for me & few times to my son to this place.  The cafe inside this casino looks like a nice meal with reasonable price.. The area is like a cafe with booths & tables for 4.. The service was very good.  The steak meal is $13 & my fish meal was about $10. The taste is good & the size was awesome.
Prime rib is really cheap here. Taste wise it was okay. Mashed potatoes was good. Green beans no so much. Forgot to give the free beer they claim to give you. . New York steak was okay for price. Not too great though. Not much to say about that.
I love this place. Food is delicious and you can't beat steak and shrimp for $11.99!!!
The food is great and the beer is FANTASTIC.  $2.00 for delicious beer thats brewed right here on premisis.  I've been coming here for over a decade.  The garlic green beans are a signature side here.. . There are newer and fancier places to go and eat here in Vegas for sure, but I'd rather eat the first rate food AND gamble the savings for an opportunity to win....  Again!
If you like great food at reasonable prices, then this place should be a MUST on your Las Vegas list.  Great value for money and the beer's quality is unbeatable - at a price that is right out of yesteryear.  This is old Vegas, the way it used to be.
Signing up for the free membership earns you a $9 (?) steak dinner with a free draft beer and two sides (good for member and 3 guests if I remember correctly). It was as good as you would expect it would be for that price. Food was edible, but not incredible. The beer was respectable, but I would not order two.. . Location is a modest walk away from the strip, but it is a good value meal for Vegas.
Do not let the appearance of the casino deter you away, $5 steak and a pretty decent weiss with a slice of lemon await you. I honestly had no problems with the wait staff, he was very friendly and quick. Maybe it was because we were not falling over drunk and pissing all over the seat that had something to do with it (although I don't judge, it is Las Vegas after all). The salad had no whites, all green with a pretty decent Thousand Island dressing. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted on point which was a surprise. Don't mix up the brewery with the restaurant, keep walking past until you hear people singing off-key!
Ate at the bbq place inside and it was amazingly good!! Boyfriend ordered the full rack of ribs for $13.99 and I got half a chicken and half ribs for $11.99. Best deal in town and ribs we're fall of the bone tender! Our waiter was so nice and some the best service I ever gotten anywhere. This is will definitely be our go to bbq spot!
Just slightly off the strip, Ellis Island is the place to go for late night steak and eggs. Save yourself the trouble of finding decently priced steak and eggs on the strip and just take a taxi here.. . For $6.99 you get a nice size piece of not too shabby cooked steak, fried potatoes, and  eggs anyway you like. WITH toast of course :). . The wait wasn't too bad either. Quick service. Win Win. . . Not the best steak, but for that time of day, it will definitely satisfy and post partying cravings you have!
This is our favorite go to place to eat in Vegas.   We are locals and we love it here.  The restaurant is the best food in Vegas.   The servers are awesome and I hear the karaoke is awesome although I don't drink so haven't been to the bar but I can hear it from the restaurant and it sounds great.  We just are very thankful for the great deals and the awesome atmosphere.
I really enjoyed Ellis Island for it's local beers and great prices. The dinner included a steak and a beer and choice of soup / salad. The atmosphere is calm for being in a casino environment. When I visited there was a slight wait and my buddy and I were able to go and play a couple of hands of blackjack. We won enough to pay for the meal and leave with extra. All in all a good experience that I would recommend for an off the strip local hangout with great pricing.
An hour and a half wait to be seated for mediocre food.  I don't think so.  Not happening in this lifetime.
Love this place! Players cards have great daily rewards. The food is delicious - especially the ribs and pizza. Bar gets way too crowded - I suggest they add another one. This is where the locals go near The Strip.
