Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are ginormous. It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces. I would say that most of the dishes here can be split with a friend.  My breakfast was pretty delicious. My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait.  I definitely recommend this place.
Leave it to me to visit a famous brunch place like Hash House A Go Go and, amidst all the scrumptiously savory options, opt for.... . Oatmeal.. . Dude, it's Vegas. More specifically, it was EDC. Salt retains water and makes you bloat. Look it up if you don't believe me.. . $8.75 for a huge bowl of STEEL-CUT OATMEAL topped with mixed fresh fruit (bananas, oranges, strawberries, watermelon, blackberries, blueberries), brown sugar, and milk, with soy milk substitute for $0.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=MvpCoCsWZOkCv1zg6Wsm_A#MvpCoCsWZOkCv1zg6Wsm_A). Though this menu item won't give your taste buds a wild time (don't worry, that's what the rest of Vegas is for), the portion is huge--'Murica size huge--and filling. You probs won't finish it all. But serious kudos if you do manage to finish it all in one sitting because it's a ton of oatmeal. Literally.. . But really, what better to feed me than oatmeal for EDC ;)
Came here around 9 o'clock on a Saturday night. Wasn't too busy. The good was delicious! Bought the chicken and waffles. The plates are so big two people can share an entree. The only reason it got 3 stars was the service. We were on a double date and the other couple got their food first and they were almost finished eating by the time our food came out. It literally took an extra 15 minutes before we could eat. Now of course we weren't mad at our friends for eating, but seriously us having to watch our friends eat sucks and is bad form. We did some light complaining to the waiter and he didn't even act like he cared. I would probably try this again though because it was only my first time and you can't always hold it against a restaurant for one instance of employee slack. So hopefully my next visit will be better.
Every time I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to make a special trip here. Absolutely love this place. This is great for the person who loves breakfast food no matter what time of a day it is. The Corn Beef and Hash is my all time favorite. They give you a large portion of corn beef with potatoes two eggs (style of your choosing) and a biscuit. The corn beef is never extremely greasy the way a lot of other places make theirs. It's always delicious.  . . Another one of my favorites is the banana pancake. It's a giant pancake with bananas cooked into it as a posed to just sitting on top. Also very delicious and a great size for sharing. . . My only negative is that during some parts of the day there is a long wait and the last time I went two employees were arguing in from of the hostess station (a little unprofessional). But these has never stopped me from going. I would suggest going very early in the morning or late at night for their late night menu. . . I always have a positive experience when coming here. Highly recommend this place!!!
Assolutamente da provare, ma solo se veramente affamati: le porzioni sono enormi! !!! Specialita Pollo fritto alla benedict: man Vs food non sbaglia mai!!!!
Bad location the garnish ruins the meal there's  no restrooms inside the restaurant . . . Great music and fun environment  AMAZING BLOODY MARY'S BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE SUCks bC OF THE LOCATION I would not go back
Came here for a 1pm breakfast on July 25th 2014 with a friend. We were hung over and starving for some breakfast. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait and that we should stay close because it could be sooner since people miss the call for their tables. We ended up only waiting 15-20 minutes and we were able to get some good screwdrivers while we waited. The menu was very unique for my tastes but I ordered the sage chicken. We were told it would be about another 45 minute wait for our food after we ordered. It didn't take that long, maybe 30 minutes maximum. Our waiter forgot to bring my friends drink and took some effort to flag him down to ask about the drink, but he returned with the drink promptly once we were able to flag him down. The food was delicious and the price was very reasonable for the amount of food. I couldn't finish all my food, which is very rare. The waiter brought us jam, butter, and honey at our our request, no questions asked and no wait. I would go here for breakfast over a cheap breakfast buffet everyday if the wait was a little shorter and i wasn't in a hurry to lose more money. I will definitely try to come here every time i come to Vegas.
Checked this place out on the last day I was there in Vegas, its right inside the Quad hotel. You have go through the hotel take the escalators to get to the top and bam your there. Now I want to gripe a little bit about the arrangement of taking in guests. The first thing you see is a line to your left at a counter, thats where you put your name down right? WRONG thats where you can order a drink. . . I was so disappointed that I waited about an additional ten minutes than I needed to in a line I did not need to wait in. I saw a line that was getting larger at the counter I assumed this is where you put your name down but it wasn't it was just to order drinks if you wanted any during the wait. You have to pass up this counter to go to the front of the restaurant to put your name down. By the time I figured this out there were already about maybe ten or twenty names ahead of me so I had to wait a little bit longer. FIX THIS GUYS this was very frustrating for me and a few luckily for some guests I saved them by pointing them to the front, thank God I was there. . . Alright after about a twenty five minute wait I got myself a bloody mary just before getting called. The bloody Mary was beautiful with its  green olives and pickled chili and man oh man does it have a lot of pepper, you can almost not tolerate it at first but after yo suck down all the pepper that settled at the bottom, the drink gets easier to finish. . . Me and the wife got a booth and I have to say the industrial look was eeh dont really know how that connects to any theme but ok. There is like metal platform plates bolted everywhere and the tables are also covered in sheets of aluminum, very cold to rest your elbows on but ok lets get to the food. Me and my wife shared a chicken and waffles breakfast, trust me everything in this place is share-able because of the HUGE amount of food they heep onto your plate. . . The service was pretty good although because it was so busy here it was kind of hard to get the attention of our waiter. He eventually would come by and got us whatever we needed but you can't blame the guy the restaurant was at maximum capacity, I know he was trying to keep up as best as he could. . . When the chicken and waffles showed up it was a tower of fried chicken on top of bacon loaded waffles. It looked good but it didn't taste as good as it looked, the chicken and the waffles taste as if it was frozen bought and reheated. The only reason why anyone would forgive the taste is because you get so much food, seriously. My wife said it was good and then I asked her ok lets take away most of the food and give you one piece of chicken and one waffle would you still be happy and she said no and I asked why and she said because its not enough it doesnt taste that good that it can be on its own, and I said ah ha! see told you its really not that good. . . We also ordered extra biscuits with gravy which was also ok but it was gigantic enough to satisfy our questions for taste. Its really hard to say bad things about a restaurants in vegas because to be honest you have limited amount of choices, especially for breakfast. Would I come here again? well I dont know we'll see. The prices where not that bad to be honest. The only thing redeemable here was the bloody mary which again was just ok.. . ps: also forgot to mention if you need to go to the restroom you need to go back downstairs to the hotels restrooms. They do not have any restrooms inside the restaurant, really sucks when you just need to wash your hands.
Parking sucks!! Looks like a delivery zone for trucks. You wonder if your in the right spot. BUT... It's worth a try cuz the service is good and the food is pretty darn tasty. VERY large portions, enough to feed 2.
First time back in a while.  Atmosphere still good.  Started with Fried Green Tomatoes.   Tomatoes were flavorful.  Finished up with Chicken and Waffles.   Chicken was fried to perfection and very crisp.  Waffles were good too.  Took quiet a while for entree to arrive.  We took home half the entree as the portion sizes here are ginormous!!!
Awesome I will be returning!!
Man, MY idea of a BREAKFAST place............and WAY MORE!!. . Bloody Mary's definitely and inspiration.  Full bar.  Waitresses add to atmosphere.  Several tats and just a little attitude.........but good service.  Food was "monstrous" in size and NO one at our table (two guys; two women) could finish their meals.  Good quality, too.. . You can't miss with the Chicken Benedict or whatever it's called officially that was featured on Man v. Food.  I will post a pic.  . . Get there early or make sure you have a line pass/Total Rewards Platinum or higher card as the line can go out the door.  Because it takes awhile for food to be prepared fresh AND it takes awhile for folks to eat THAT much food, I would make sure you saved enough time.  This is NOT a fast food experience by any means!  The one we visited was in the Quad....soon to be renamed Linq Hotel.  (A Ceasars/Harrah's property).  Located next to the new Linq development and the new High Roller.. . website: http://www.thequadlv.com/restaurants/hash-house-a-go-go.html#.U-K05aNmasM
Definately share a plate w someone else. Second visit... Chicken and waffles... Must get! Sooooo good!
Wait: Forever! It was super crowded, then once we were seated we had to wait even longer for our server to get to us. Since, for some reason, on a busy Saturday they had decided to have the poor, overworked bartender also serve about 10 tables. Annoying.. . Food: Uh.. Yes, I'm a fatty, but asking to have your eggs scrambled soft does not mean "please bring me out a GIANT bowl of over cooked eggs, because I've sent back two sets of eggs that were also incredibly over cooked." I don't want more shitty eggs, I want my two eggs cooked properly. Or at the very least, not the exact opposite of how I like them. I'm not that picky..   . If you don't know what scrambled soft means, don't give us the option to ask how we want our eggs. Just tell me, "the only scrambled eggs we have are premade and sitting under a heat lamp getting nice and bouncy!" Then I can change my order. Simple.
We came here based on reviews, but were incredibly disappointed. They say that they are famous for their buttermilk sage fried chicken, so we wanted to try it. The chicken breasts had multiple chunks of fat on them, which is just gross when you bite into them. So, they can't be bothered to trim the chicken before frying it? The biscuits that came with the meal were dry and tasteless, even though they were covered in melted butter and honey. So basically, we received huge piles of terrible food!! We were sick to our stomachs for the rest of the evening. We had the remainder of our meal boxed up, which we gave to a hungry homeless person on the strip! It was just gross...don't bother!
So it's, I don't know, 1am, on a Tuesday morning in Vegas, and I'm starving. I have this terrible habit of waiting until the very last minute to eat anything and therefore, I get insanely grumpy as my stomach starts to growl and hurt and all I want to do is eat something. Only problem is, even though it's Vegas and the place never really shuts down, it's still hard to find something to nosh on that doesn't cost an exorbitant amount of cash, or is even really open (and no, I will not eat Denny's way up by the Rivera- It's gross and the walk is ridiculous).. . "Ever heard of Hash House A Go Go?" my buddy asks me as we stand by the Bellagio fountains, sweating in the humid air, my temper already on a very short fuse cuz I'm sure not even orphans in war torn Africa are as hungry as I am at that moment in time.. . "Nope," I reply. "But as long as it isn't pizza or somewhere far, I'll give it a shot.". . We cross over to the Quad (which is actually pretty nice now that it's been remodeled and doesn't reek of pure tackiness) and, there at the top of the escalators, we walk into the place. Yes, I said "walk-in", as in we didn't have to wait in these really long lines everyone is complaining about on here. Maybe it's because it was mid-week and early in the morning, I have no idea, but those long wait times were non-existent.. . Like others, I don't really get the whole ambiance of the place. Is it industrial? Is it retro? Is it some weird steam-punk amalgamation? Whatever it is, it doesn't really work. The various pictures on the wall (I seem to remember cowboys and burgers- but then again, I think I was a little drunk), just don't seem to mesh with the metal and the gray paint. But whatever, I was there to eat, not be an interior critic.. . How long do you think for us to be seen by our waitress? 30 minutes? 40? Neither of those. Honestly, I would wager it was all of about 5 minutes or so before our waitress was at our table, asking for our orders. Hell, we had barely even begun to look at the menu. In fact, I was a little to preoccupied with the waitress herself, who was looking really good with her tattoos and nice smile. Her helpfulness was also pretty alluring.. . Now, speaking of the menu, which is really what this whole thing is about isn't it? It's not especially big, by which I mean there wasn't a huge selection to chose from. The place brands itself as a breakfast joint, and they have a decent amount of offerings in that department, but I was more interested in something a little more traditional. I picked the burger and only after I made that decision did I realize it had mashed potatoes on it. Mashed potatoes? On a burger? What the hell? Well, I was in Vegas and it was late, and I was hungry, and I had to live a little, so I went with it. Plus, the waitress (who's name I can't remember, although I wanna say it was Gia, or something like that) had been so nice and I didn't want to make her hate me. My buddy, also drunk and clearly feeling the effects of drunk hunger, ordered the chicken and waffles on the suggestion of our server. She said it was good and what most people ordered. She also said the portions were huge.. . When she said huge, she meant it. My burger came and I swear to God the thing stood like 8 inches tall. So much meat and toppings crammed in it. Yes, those mashed potatoes took up some of that space and I debated scratching them off with a knife, but they must have put those potatoes in there for a reason, right? I went ahead and just dove right in, tastes be damned. I can say that whoever made the decision to put those fluffy, white, mashed roots on a hunk of beef is a culinary genius and deserves an award. Simply put, my burger was delicious. I couldn't even finish all of it in one sitting, however I was able to take it back to the hotel and eat the rest of it for lunch the next day. It was almost like a whole new meal. As far as the chicken and waffles went, those too, should win some type of prize. They came pilled up on a plate in some kind of pyramid like stack, ready for consumption.  Oh, and those waffles had bacon in them. Yes, tasty, salty, crunchy, glorious bacon, mixed into the batter! . . Would I recommend this place? Yes!. Would I return? That would be a resounding Hell Yes!
Food was not good. It's all mushed together & you have to disassemble their "presentation." I wouldn't go back at all.
The wait for Sunday brunch is horrendous (about 45 min to an hour for a party of 6 when we checked in with the hostess around 12PM). They also do NOT take day of reservations on theweekends (boo!). However, they seemed to turnover tables pretty quickly - and to my surprise - actually had plenty of empty tables when we got seated. . . The menu is expansive. You have your sweet, your savory, your burgers, and your hashes. I ordered the rosemary chicken hash which came with: two eggs however you want it, breakfast potatoes, and a large biscuit. Although the chicken was not as well seasoned as the description seemed to claim, it was cooked well and nicely complemented by the sauteed asparagus. . . BE WARNED: The portions are gargantuan, so consider sharing with a friend when you are ordering. I swear my eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw how large some of my friends and neighbors' dishes were when they arrived at the table. Although my hash platter was not large in comparison to some of the other dishes that arrived at our table, I ate my fill and still had enough left over for breakfast the next day! . . The only downside -  our waitress wasn't particularly friendly, and made obvious that we were a burden to her load, but my friends and I enjoyed each others company and had a great time anyway.
The food here was absolutely spectacular. I ordered the French toast and it was so soft and perfectly tasty. The best I've ever had. I also tried my friends hash browns. They were perfect. The food there is easily 5 stars. The service however is not so great. Our waiter, in particular, was quite serious and terse. We asked him to split the check and he turned into a drama queen and made it seem like it was the end of the world. I'm pretty sure he rolled his eyes too. But hopefully your service experience will be different. The food is most definitely worth giving it a go!
The sever switched the receipt n he wrote $37 more, then he signed it!!. Although I payed 18% tips :( . He must thought we're just tourist from Asia n not gonna argue with that.. More ridiculous thing is the manager seems like doesn't care about this.. I talked to the manager n she said they gonna refund it ASAP but after they got my card info I can't hear anything from her over 10days!!. So I had to call my card customer service explained what's going on-_-. Everyone knows fake sign is serious problem but only this restaurant doesn't know.. . This was the worst worst experience I ever been through
Place is awesome. Open all night. Portions are HUGE!!! I give the food a B. Good service and good prices
ok lets get straight to the point.....go here before you die!!!! off da chain!!!! food....appearance....quality....service...well deserved! stop guessing....and go...period!
This place has quickly morphed into a "must do" bucket list kind of thing!  I hit this joint every single Vegas trip. It will fulfill all your food fantasies, PG or XXX.  Fun for the whole family. Be careful you will over order by about 5 families.  The meatloaf hash is one of my faves.  I always start with the wagon wheel sized soft pretzel that comes hanging on a rack with a couple dipping sauces.  Service has always been spot on and attentive and full of suggestions.You will not be disappointed.
Everything on the menu comes large and in charge. Unless you are Man vs Food caliber, expect to share or bring home leftovers. I did exactly that and shared my fried chicken eggs benedict with my boo thang. All in all it was very satisfying. What I can tell is that their fried chicken is very good. The batt contains corn flakes in it and the chicken stays juicy and moist yet fully cooked. In some ways the fried chicken is better than roscoe's (but that is up to debate, imo roscoe's) . . What was a pleasant delight was there BLT Bloody Mary. Containing a slice of bacon and lettuce (just because) and a side of toast.. honestly it probably was just the presentation of the bacon and toast added to the drink but it made the experience of drinking their bloody mary so much more enjoyable. Getting all of the Ooh and Aahs when served to my table was also nice, and quite honestly, the attention you get is half of the payoff, am i right?. . Our server had a crazy mohawk which was totally awesome, he was happy to answer questions about it also which was very nice of him. Ive been here a couple times and it has never disappointed. . . If you don't know what to get, get the chicken and bacon waffles. It seems to be their most popular dish. FYI, this place was on Man vs. Food, no challenge just giving credit where credit is due.
Huge portions and great presentation, but the food isn't very flavorful. Last time we went, we waited a lot longer than they originally told us. We noticed some people were being seated before us, even though they came way after us. After complaining, they sat us down. This was our second time here and I'm still not impressed. There are so many better breakfast places in vegas. This will be our last time.
Andys sage fried chicken was the best dish I've had in my entire life!! I'm happy to hear I have one close to home in Florida! Congratulations to Hash House to go go, for creating this amazing dish!
If you need to grab a bite in Vegas this is the place!! Seven of us managed to split three dishes: the portion sizes are huge I'd suggest splitting the plates unless your real hungry. Has the chicken and waffles the best ever! The service was perfect, one of the gals drinks was really delayed and the waiter took it off. Superior service!
One of my most anticipated stops in Vegas. Huge portions & the food is delicious. I always get Andy's safe fried chicken Benedict. My boyfriend usually tries there burgers. & we always share a side the Mac & cheese. It is so good!! If you go on a Sunday morning be prepared to wait a little while, but it's gonna b worth every minute.
Big portions AND good food??? This place is known for it's very big portions. We decided to stop by before we left to go back home. We arrived at 930 and only waited about 5 minutes before getting seated (this is a first). There were maybe 3-4 other groups waiting at that time. This place is 24/7 now!!. . The drinks are pretty pricey. Fresh squeezed juice can get up to $7 and a their coffe drinks to $8. I opted for their watermelon kiwi lemonade..doesn't it just sound delicious?? This was $5.50 and so refreshing. My friend ordered the hazelnut latte, which was also very delicious. It's not too sweet and the whip cream on top is so yummy. Maybe they do have a reason for pricey drinks! . . It took us awhile to finally order our food because there are so many choices...and so little stomach room. I ended up ordering the Corned Beef Hash. This came with corned beef, onion, swiss on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs, and a bisquit. It was a pile of cheesy beefy starchy goodness. My only complaint was that I asked for the eggs to be cooked over medium well but.. they were pretty much cooked through. I like the white to be cooked, but the yolk still runny.   . . My friend ordered the Chorizo Hash and this came with chorizo, cheddar cheese, jalapeno, and tomatoes on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs and a bisquit. I had tried this before on another visit and recommended it to my friend. There's just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos and not too greasy from the chorizo. Very delicious. She ordered her eggs the same way, and it came out perfect! . . Service was good. We didn't wait long when we requested something. Out waiter was very nice! When we finished eating and walked out.. (around 11) there were SSO MANY people and the wait was so long. Try and come early.. avoid lunch rush hour!!
Very large portions. Easy for couples to share. The lemonade mimosa is flavorful. Don't arrive hungry in May be a long wait. You have to order sage  chicken and waffles.
I don't know what all the rage is about.  yeah, the food was HUGE.  The chicken was done with ginger, something i've had at post and beam in LA.  I got a breakfast plate (waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage).  Honestly, it was as average as a hole-in-a-wall.  Sure, maybe if I got that Man v. Food plate, they may have gotten one more star out of me, but the service would have knocked it back down to 3.. . This was a 11pm food run with maybe a restaurant that was 45% full.  I shouldn't be applying this to all the servers since I did see several waiters wizzing by me numerous times; however, i just didn't see mine.  Never refilled my water, kept the table waiting for a box, then the check, the the receipt.  Literally, 22 mins between when I was finished and when I was able to sign the check and leave.  Don't get me wrong, the dude was nice.  Very courteous and opened his greeting like a pro.  When its closing to midnight, I just need basic service and I didn't get it - Sit, order, a refill, and check.  . . Good:  Food. Bad:  Service
I went one late morning for brunch extremely excited because of all the reviews on yelp and the menu does just look mouth watering. However, the portions are HUGE but the food is just not that great. Prices are a little high but you need to think about the amount of food you are getting. I tried the chicken and waffles which was a let down. The spinach and cheddar eggs were good, but again, nothing out of this world.
Never disappointed when I come here.  Great food and the portions are huge!
Chicken and waffles are awesome huge portions.  Great Bloody Mary's too.
What the frick. Could the dishes BE any bigger?!??!. . FASHOOO share with someone when you eat here. Do not even doubt the size because anything you get will be good enough for 2 if not 3 people!! You definitely get your moneys worth, but the food is definitely not ideal to take to go when you can't finish your meal so try to find a dish wanted w your friend and just gooo for it.. . Somehow I finished all the toppings of my HH original benedict only leaving behind half the mashed potatoes and a little bit of the biscuit (WHICH IS TO DIE FOR BTW THE BISCUIT WAS OOOOH LAWDDDD). . but everything else..... . CHICKEN POT PIE - the size of an actual freakin pie. looks like a pie that threw up its insides gracefully. . SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT - huge pile of compost lookin food but BET IT TASTED GOOD. . CHICKEN ROSEMARY HASH PLATE - big square plated hash on a pan big enough to cook on. . just why. never again not listening to reviews. satisfying, but really hash house?? really???
My wife and I went there for a late lunch  I ordered the bbblt  and my wife ordered  the radish salad  with  cucumber ranch  dressing. The bbblt was real good and jay  the server even said that  was one of his  favorite sandwiches on the menu  and he the salad that my wife ordered was awesome too the cucumber dressing. Was even better  and the taste was real  refreshing  too. I'd like to go back again  and again ..
I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service my friend and I received as well as the food. It wasn't as good as I've heard it to be. I had the andy sage fried chicken with potatoes and my friend had the kokomo burger/sandwich. I had so much leftover that I took it to-go and gave it to a homeless person because I didn't want to waste the food... pretty disappointed.
Wow!!!!! That's all I have to say about this place! I don't know how they are not charging more for the amount of portions you get. The girlfriend and I ordered the chicken and bacon waffles and it was the best breakfast I've ever had in my life!! Share with someone do not get one for each. One comes with 2 big pieces of fried chicken breast and 4 bacon waffles! Split that in half and you still won't be able to finis it and I'm a big boy but still couldn't handle it. Best breakfast under $20 . . For drinks I recommend the watermelon spiked lemonade!! So good and refreshing!! And the watermelon is so juicy!. . 2 drinks and chicken and waffles for under. $40 so worth every penny. . Our waiter Travis was really cool and always checking in with us. He's the dude rocking the big punk Mohawk can't miss him lol. Get him a raise ASAP!!
A. Ma. Zing. The waiter suggested that my husband and I split the French toast and the sage fried chicken Benedict for a little sweet/salty mix and it was ridiculous!!! Highly recommend!!
I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It hit the spot. I like their food. I wish their portions were smaller. I have to share because I can't possibly eat that much.
Being the billionth person to review this place, what could I say that hasn't already been said? How about praise for the terrific service? I got into Vegas late and hungry,  walked over to Hash House around midnight, and sat at the bar. The bartender/server's name was Fonda, and she treated my half-awake, bewildered self as if I were the customer she had been waiting to see all day. She made me a BLT Bloody Mary in no time flat, and it was great-- and so generous with the alcohol that it scared me a little. . . I ordered the famous sage fried chicken and bacon waffles that everyone on Yelp said were fantastic. I am here to tell you, everyone on Yelp is telling the truth. It's delicious-- like, the kind of delicious where you try to commit the flavors to memory so you can attempt to vaguely duplicate it at home. Two people can easily share this meal. Both Fonda and another (male) server were very attentive without being overbearing, and I felt very appreciative to feel so welcomed as soon as I arrived in Las Vegas. And this place is really perfect for Vegas: Mom's home cooking, but larger than life and more luxurious!. . The place is cute. It was a little confusing to find at first, but it's upstairs in the Quad, right next to The Linq. If you are in the Flamingo and walk out the door that leads to the Linq, it's more or less directly across the path. You just have to go into the building and follow the escalators upstairs.
Normally I woul led give this place 5 stars but the wait staff tonight was horrible, I find it very hard to tip someone who makes you feel like you are an interruption to their business....Hello Helen you work for tips don't you....tonight you worked my table for free. No tip....sorry
Love this place... you have to get the Chicken and Waffles. Yum!
The portions are huge! Make sure you bring your appetite!
I've always loved hash house, great food and bloody Mary's. However last night watching the beyond poor customer service was sad. A young ladywalked in very intoxicated ordered then passed out w/ her head on the table. No one tried to wake her get her water, make sure she was ok, or get her out. the waiter dropped off her food w/o saying a word, countless wait staff walked by her as she slept for 45 minutes before a manager came out, he tried to wake her then just left.. Customers were asking if she was ok if she needed help. Finally after almost an hour the young lady embarrassed got up and left. I asked the hostess what there policy was for leaving people like that she just shrugged and walked off.  Yes we're in Vegas and yes she was drunk but who's to say she didn't have a medical condition?? Also it's sad that customers were more concerned about her safety then the people who worked there.
We went for brunch and there was a wait, but the host staff got us seated very quickly. . . Out group mostly had the fried chicken and one got the meatloaf sandwich. The fried chicken and waffles is a must, you could probably split it between 3-4 people. The flavors go together very well and the price is very reasonable. The meatloaf sandwich was outstanding. . . Our food did take a while to come out; however, it was appreciated that our server let us know ahead of time that it would be use everything was made from scratch and there were no heat lamps. . . Definitely a great place to go to nurse your hangover!
I must say that the wait here is a lot shorter and moves a lot quicker than the Hash House located inside the M Resort. Upon arrival there was a very long line but the wait was barely fifteen minutes so don'tbe deterred by the lines. Staff members here are very helpful and they work hard to get you in and out in a timely manner! The food is grade A as it is at any Hash House. Definitely worth a couple tries!
1 plate of anything here should be enough for 4 small people or 2 large people
Was looking for somewhere to eat after our Male Review show. Remembered that this place place opens 24/7. Got there around 1030pm. Got seated right away not packed like i was expecting. I remembered the portion size was huge so we decided to share everything. Ordered Salmon, Ribs, Chicken and biscuits, Penne Pasta , and a couple Watermelon Kiwi Lemondes. Everything was fantastic. I ate so much i couldn't breath or move. Definitely coming back here whenever i'm back in Vegas!
OMG ! . This place was the shit ! Got recommended by a friend , and im glad we went ! I had the steak and eggs ! Didn't leave anything in the plate ! My friend ordered chicken & waffles and I even got try some of his plate . The waffles had cooked bacon on the inside ! The only thing that I didn't like was the 1hr wait . But after we ate we were glad we waited !
Great food and huge portions. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas. The breakfast is amazing. The orange juice also taste great. The server we had was really nice and made great recommendations about what to taste in the menu. The meals can be shared by two, unless your really hungry!!! I recommend the chorizo plate!!!
Went here for breakfast not quite knowing what to expect. Well, I can honestly say that my expectations were not only met, but exceeded! Girlfriend and I looked around at all the other tables around us, and noticed that the portions were huge, so we decided to split the chicken and waffles. It was absolutely amazing, and I wasn't quite sure that I was going to enjoy it, considering that chicken and waffles is a southern thing and I'm from the Midwest. The chicken was tender and the waffles were stuffed with bacon! How can you go wrong with that?! We both ordered OJ to drink, and it tasted as if it had just been squeezed! The atmosphere in the restaurant takes on a farm theme, and it is very fitting, The decor, the fixtures, the tables, it all goes together very well. The prices are a little steep (the OJ was $7 per glass!) but hey, it's Vegas. You have to expect to pay more.
I had been dying to try this place after seeing pictures of the chicken and waffles circulating around the web. I mean who wouldn't want to try a chicken and waffle tower?. . i came here with a group of 4 and the wait was exceptionally long, which is something that should be expected when you are going to one of the most rated restaurants in Vegas. After standing for a near 45 minutes I could feel my stomach screaming at me from the Fat Tuesday indulgence I had the night before and from the teasing stench of crispy fried goodness. The waiter warned us that the chicken and waffles are best shared because of the sheer size of the dish. . . Boy was the waiter right. Not only was this the largest chicken and waffles I have ever seen but it was also the most delicious fried greasy bird that I have ever had. It was crispy, sweet and savory all at once. I would definitely come back to this place but next time I will make sure to come at an odd hour so I don't have to torture myself with the long wait.
The wait is crazy here so don't go if you want a quick meal or arrive hungry! Go early or else you'll wait for at least an hr! Food is made to order so that's another 15-30 mins wait. With that said, I really enjoyed the food here, the portions are huge, sharing food is highly recommended. Got the The Tractor Driver Combo with French Toast and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this place if you have the time. . . Parking: Parking lot is free but it's a maze to find the entrance.
Got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which was highly recommended here on Yelp and was featured on Man vs. Food and boy it did not fail to deliver! Soo delicious - wish I could have eaten it all, but sadly there was just so much food and there was no fridge or microwave in our hotel. :( The giant serving comes with a huge piece of fried chicken breast with egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, and mashed potatoes all topped with a slightly spicy house bechamel sauce. If you get it to go, the sauce comes on the side, which is a nice touch and allowed me to adjust the amount of sauce I wanted (so you might want to ask for it on the side as well judging by how much sauce comes on it otherwise). The only thing I wish was that sage flavor on the chicken came through a little more. Not too pricey given the portion size. I came here around 7 am on a Saturday so it was not very full (there were maybe 4 parties are so sitting). My take out order came out in less than 10 minutes, which was certainly impressive. The restaurant is pretty small overall though so I can see how it gets insanely packed. My advice, come early. You won't regret it.
I am a definite foodie. This is one of the best places I have been to for brunch. The Chorizo hash is some of the best Choriozo I have ever tasted the fact that there is jalapenos cooked into the hash and they serve it with potatoes and just a side note that you can request a tortilla in place of the biscuits. The drink with the watermelon is delicious as well as the drink that is like a mimosa but better. . . The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating versus a 5 star rating is because we had a 2 1/2 hour wait. while they were letting other groups in we continued to wait.
It's busy but very well organized. Be patient and you will be rewarded! Service is great and the food is unlike anything I've had before (in a very good way).
Was told by many to try hash house. Walked into the restuarant. I wasn't that impressed thought it just looked like any other place. But it didn't dissappoint. Awesome bloody mary & the vanilla dipped french toast wow I need to figure out how to make it this good at home. Tried a bite of my friend's waffles & fried chicken mind blowing. If your are ever near one it's worth it.
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Portions are out of control, but you're in Vegas, go big or go home. . . We always get the chicken and waffles and then we always try something else. This latest time I got the Boston Scramble. I would recommend they put this on the regular menu. Delicious!! . . I would HIGHLY recommend has house to anyone looking for a unique dining experience in Vegas. ;-)
Went here based on previous reviews. Thank goodness we did. The food was amazing and the portion sizes were ridiculously large. We went in for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was fairly empty, however, it was midweek so we weren't concerned. We were a group of 7 and we each chose different entrees. Each were excellent choices. The only downside was the absence of a restroom. The restaurant is located upstairs from the casino at The Quad, even though the restroom is a short trip down the escalator it is still a bit inconvenient. I wish The Quad would've considered a small restroom for patrons. Nevertheless, that will not hinder me from returning!
We eat here every time I get my oil changed at Lexus, which is right next door. The food is legit delicious, but the portion sizes are out of control. It almost takes away from the fact the food is high quality and inspired, and turns the experience a little gimmicky for my taste....however...if you take a friend, and agree on an entree to share (which might not be easy as the whole menu sound yummy) the portions seem more manageable and you can focus on the quality of the food, which is on point, versus the mammoth quantity.
Definitely the place to go for breakfast when in Vegas. Portion sizes are huge. Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and still we had left overs. We both ordered OJ and we could have shared those as well. Biscuits with the meal were really good as well as the crust on the chicken! Based on other reviews will have to go back and try the chicken and waffles.
Before I get to how good the food was, the service here is super friendly! . . Now onto the food, I got the pub crawl sandwich and I didnt expect it to be that big of a portion! So its totally worth the price.  I got the mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon on it as the side order and it was probably the best I've ever had! Oh gawd!
