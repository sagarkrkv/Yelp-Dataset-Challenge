I can definitely see why people are fans of this place. However, I'm not in that boat.. . Let's start with the wait. We came at a time where it should have been well after lunch time rush but there was still a 20 minute wait. If I'm driving into the middle of nowhere, the food better be damn good!. . We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. . . The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: While it was interesting and enjoyable, it's not something I personally would crave. Was it tasty? Yeah I suppose... but the fries itself isn't specially made extra good. While eating it, I couldn't help but compare them to McDonald's fries. They were 11-12 dollars. . . The Mr. Ho's Burger: I definitely had better burgers! The bun was taro flavored, or so its said, and therefore it's purple. Unfortunately, you're not able to taste any subtleties because the sauce was so overpowering. We split thisburger and I'm raised with the voice of my parents saying there are starving children in Africa if a grain of rice is left on my plate, even till today, but I simply couldn't finish this half of my burger because of how strong and over-applied the sauce was. And this was only half a burger. This was also about 12 dollars. . . Perhaps the rest of the menu items are sublime, that's a possibility. But there was definitely a disconnect between the food I got and the raving reviews. It's hip and trendy and could very well be a spot in the middle of West Hollywood or Downtown LA, but I'm very sorry to say it felt like this place was more hype than substance. I know I'm definitely in the minority on this.. . Overall: Like the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, don't regret getting it but I wouldn't do it again.
Pretentious.. Kinda sums up my experience there. We just happened upon Bachi burgers driving down Windmill Lane.  The staff was friendly, but gave off this arrogant vibe "your lucky to be here".  Beer, btw, is $7 per small glass. So 2 beers, for 2 people, will set you back $28 !!! They feel special and don't mind raping customer wallets. The burgers were good - but not $30 good for two burgers. .  Next time, we will just hit Smash Burgers.
A coworker recommended this place & I had to try it. I had the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, which were interesting. It's not too salty, it had a sweetness to it which was different but not bad at all. It can get pretty packed fast, so keep that in mind. Service was friendly, I would def recommend it to people!
This is definitely the best burger joint I've ever been to. I'd write more, but this is already my second review. Lol. I got the same exact burger as last time, Kiki Burger, and it tasted like perfection. The jalapeno pepper fries with pineapple ketchup is like no other. I will always be a fan here!!!
If you want delicious burgers that are a bit out of the ordinary, this is the place to visit, and expect a wait.  The oxtail fries were outstanding and my adult son raved about the shakes.  I had a Ronin burger, added bacon and jalapenos, it was very tasty.  Everyone enjoyed the meal, and the service was good (not great).  The only issue was the one stall restroom, it was disgusting.
Update to my review from a few months ago:. . Revisited Bachi Burger today for lunch. Had the Miyagi-San Burger and the Salt & Pepper French Fries. Both were epic!. . The burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) with bacon, furikake seasoning and onion rings. . . The fries were the possibly the best 'dressed up' fries I've ever had. Topped with onion salt, cilantro, fresh jalapenos, lemon grass (?) with a delicious dipping sauce. . . I'll be back for sure.
If you go, you must try the oxtail chili cheese fries. The appetizer is more than enough to substitute for an entree and it is absolutely amazing.
Service was so slow last night.  The table next to us turned over three times while there.  Only ordered appetizers, burgers and cocktails.  The bartender had to come over to replenish mixed drinks so they could re use the glass, really you don't have enough glasses for a new one.  Plates sat on table after appetizers for awhile, had to stack them so they would get the hint!  Burgers were good, fries and appetizers were good.  Food good, Service was marginal at best.  If service was good might go back however, will wait awhile hopefully staff will turn over!
first time there  really good food and service    This location is smaller than the summerlin location, but service fast and friendly.   I would definetly recommend it to others.   Matter of fact, might go there for my birthday celebration this month.
There are not enough words to describe my love for bachi burger. Undoubtedly, the best burger(s) I have ever had! Everything is grade A; from the staff, to the atmosphere; above all, the food. It's kindof a Japanese fusion resteraunt, primarily specializing in burgers (obviously). Their menu is extensive to say the least. Anything, from a vegetarian burger (red bean patty & Japanese eggplant), to oxtail chili cheese fries can be found on the menu. And EVERYTHING is delicious & you can taste the quality. If you haven't been to bachi, drop everything and GO. You will be hooked.
Love In n Out? Forget about it, this place will blow your mind! I've never travelled off the strip for a meal. Boy, I was missing out on the best burgers of mah life! I saw stars and angels while I chomped away, while my taste buds screamed out, "Hallejuah! Asian! Burgers! Genius!". . I got to try the miyagi and the kiki burgers and both were divine-okay the miyagi was better because I asked for wagyu beef for my kiki burger and it came out bunless. Not sure if that happens when you substitute the meat or by chance I accidently agreed to no buns?. . Bachi Burger, you just made Vegas a whole lot funner for me. Can't wait to come back and try each and every delectable-sounding burger.
I went with a friend on a Saturday night, so it was packed! We had a 25 wait time outside in the heat standing, but even so this place is amazing! The quality of the food was well worth the wait! I had the Kiki's Burger and I have got to say it was one of the best burgers of my life, if not the best!!!
Went here for lunch thinking maybe we try a new burger spot instead of burger bar. Arrived just after opening at 11am. Plenty of seating since we were so early. Promptly sat down and ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the black and green burger. The chili fries were large, flavor slightly on the sweet side. It would have been a good hangover meal.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. My only complaint was that there was something clawingly sweet in the burger that I couldn't pick out. Overall the food seemed to have a sweetness to it that was a little too much for me, maybe not for some. I would say 3.5 stars but I can't give it that on yelp.
Bahn mi burger was a nice surprise. The bun was fluffy and soft with pate. Shrimp with the burger and a slice of grilled pork. I didn't care much for the dipping sauce and thought it didn't need it. I ordered the fried rice for my youngest. He liked it but thought it wAs a little spicy. I ordered the pork rice ball. He enjoyed that a lot. . My husband ordered the MiYagi with fried onion rings, egg, garlic aioli served on a soft bun. He thought that it was great. My older son ordered the tonkatsu ramen and he slurped that right up. We ended our night with the chocolate cake and caramel salt milk shake. Both were ok. I thought that the cake would ooze out a bit but no luck. . I los ordered the plantation ice tea and had them add boba. Got my boba fix after all. I would recommend you give this a try.
If you want to eat off the strip, try to stop by this place. This place is pretty good, but not somewhere I have to go when I go to Vegas. This places does get pack during the weekend, but the wait usually isn't that long. I only got the Oxtail chili cheese fries since I was not hungry at the time. I tasted some of my friends orders and it was pretty good. I can't say much about this place since I didn't get to really try the food as much as I wanted to, but I will update my review it once I head back to Vegas.
My friends and I just left this place and can I just say.....SO GOOD! I had the No Meat burger and the Just fries. They were very tasty. They shared the Ox tail fries and they said that they were very delicious and the meat was very tender. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. It is a bit of a wait but for sure worth it.
Onolicious!  We indulged!  All the reviews mentioned are absolutely correct.  Now if they'd open up in Southern California. :-). . Your mouth sinks into the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries and a Kiki Burger and as my husband described it was "mouth watering orgasmic".. . Great food altogether and look forward to trying other items on their menu.
Recently went here and was amazed at how wonderful this place is. I was seated immediately and brought water as drink order was taken. I ordered an appetizer of the Chili Garlic edamame. This was Salty, with just enough heat to give you a thirst for a nice cold beer. They have several great beers on tap. Fortunately the y had a beer on tap that I recently had at Hakassan. Hitachino Nest Beer White Ale. I then Had the Rhonin Burger..  Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese . Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg . Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli. . I added aged Cheddar for an added bite. Cooked a perfect medium rare as I like it. You need to cut in half to start the egg just oozes down the burger making your taste buds yearn for that perfect bite. It was a perfect bite. I will with out a doubt eat  here again.. The service was excellent and attentive, and you know how I feel about that. Prices are moderate.. I will say this joint is jumping at lunch time and the staff handled it well. Good place for group lunches. If you get a chance go check this out if you have not. You will not be disappointed.
It has been a couple of months ago so excuse the late review but I have eaten at this location four or five times even though I'm from California. So now that the disclaimer is out of the way, onto the review. . . Bachi burger are for those who like their taste buds to rome wild.  Bachi is connected via a door way to their sister restaurant Shoku Ramen. Which closes earlier even though they share the same space. . . I started with Salt and Pepper Garlic fries. It's served with Jalapenos and a garlic chili aioli sauce.  This is great way to start off a meal. It's an explosion of tastes and it lights up your tastes buds begging for more. . . Then the Miyagi-San burger arrives and I instinctively bow my head in a gesture of respect to this masterful burger.  After practicing my wax on wax off techniques (if you understood that reference you just dated yourself) I begin to indulge myself by bitting into the burger.  I enjoy a fried egg in my burgers and if you have never had an egg in your burger, Bachi is definitely the place to venture out of the norm.. . Your mouth is challenged by the opposing textures. The hamburger bun is soft as a cloud and paired with the crispiness of the onion straws, all you can do is close your eyes and enjoy the sensory overload. At that point the flavors of the caramelized bacon and sauces kick in, and when you least expect it you are in a blissful comatose. . . I recently tried the chili fries and it's an out of body experience. Don't be afraid of the ox tail and you will pleasantly surprise your taste buds. Bachi is not where you come to be conservative or play it safe. Be adventurous and you will walk away a happy camper. . . If you want an amazing burger and avoid the strip, this is the place the come.  Since I work so often in Vegas, this is definitely one of my safe havens.
My fave burger spot. Ronin and Fois Gras are amazing. The bao and oxtail chiili fries are good. Gotta go back for more later on. Fried egg on everything fyi.
[No Bachi for coming here]. . T-Shirt wearing tenders are all you need to understand what the scene is in here. It's burgers - and no need to explain the "Bachi" part - only that my thought is its in mixing the 2 cultures ingredients that someone may receive negative results - well by the attendance, and the amount of conversation in the air, it seems like its the reverse psychological side.. . As a burger lover, you wont find cheddar, definitely not American, and hardley a sign there is a simple beef and cheese combo to be had (although you have the option of constructing your own), but you didnt come here for that anyway. I ordered the Black and Green - this is about the closest youll find to anything not too fusion-i. Their take on Wagyu Kobe Beef, naturally grass fed - open range assumed, but not Wagyu American or Japanese as stated on the front, grilled to your temp, Blue cheese crumbles, spinach, and bacon. There were some other things in there but it wasnt noticeable to note.. . Burger is substantial, and to remind you this is Vegas casual, but still upscale, they give you a knife that will not only split your burger, but would probably cut through that ceramic dish they serve it on. I opted for the hands on approach, as I do. Burger is very well done (not the cooking temp, by the way of the flag atop my bun) smooth meat to cut, the quarter pound of weight measure, and was preformed, likely in a cylindrical press as I felt the tight packing, but the slightly flakey outter edge - not to be confused with a frozen pre form that is like eating a freshly sliced sausage.. . All the other ingredients really melted into the background. What you actually find is that you can smell this beef, an aromatic experience I've found is reserved for the CAB versions - this is probably a hint you maybe in Kansas of experiences, where the beef is free, and the taste is pretty awesome.
Good lord was the 45 min wait worth it! I ordered the Miyagi burger and our table shared the oxtail chili cheese fries. Both were out of this world yummy! Servers were nice and helpful with the menu, too. Can't wait to go back to Vegas and try the Shogun burger, which has foie gras. *drools
Burgers refined & redefined! . . Amazing selection of gourmet burgers, which makes it hard to decide, but no matter the choice is sureto please. Our group of 4 (3 adults and 1 child) ordered the Bahn Mi, Miyagi-san, Spicy Miso and a children's cheeseburger. All three gourmet burgers were standouts and the children's burger was a hit too.. . The Bahn Mi was our favorite. The depth and range of flavors are indescribably delectable deliciousness.. . Only critique, the Parmesan truffle fries are quite unappetizing to look at. Taste is, okay. The appearance of runny brown sauce on top was unexpected. If it were described as a gravy sauce on the menu it would have been less of a shock. Not what we imagined Parmesan cheese fries to look like. A positive, the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is 100% tasty. Scrape off the brown slime and dip away.. . The servers are on their mark. Great knowledge of the products, good descriptions and attentive. Waiter forgot my iced coffee, but was easily forgiven since after the very satisfying meal it was time for a bit of eat and sleep.. . Aloha!
PROS:. 1. Burgers are big and juicy (although a bit overpriced.). 2. Onion rings crispy and big. 3. Black Milk Tea boba ...delish!!. 4. Kimchi burger is the BOMB!. 5. Staff were nice. . CONS:. 1.  My Kiki burger tasted exactly like the Ronin burger and that means they were just ok.  Had a weird sweetness to it but both got better 1/2 way thru.. . 2.  Ordered Oxtail Chili fries which were forgotten and then brought out long after we had finished our burgers.  And these we just - meh.. . 3.  Bar counter and tables were wiped down with mildew-smelling rag.. . 4.  Only 2 individual bathrooms, so line is long.  . . 5.  Beer was overpriced.  . . I'd go back to try a different burger  or maybe just stick with the kimchi burger!!
Honestly, Bachi Burger is one of the best gourmet burger joints in Las Vegas. If you expect to have a plain burger with your average toppings for just $2, then go to McDonalds. Otherwise, if you want a next-level, out of this world burger and don't mind forking out $13 just for a single burger, then Bachi Burger is your place.. . The employees at Bachi Burger make sure that all of the ingredients are of the highest qualities. Like I said, do not come to Bachi Burger expecting a McDonalds burger. Their burgers are HUGE. The patty itself is thicker than the dining tables. The bun is even thicker, yet it also doesn't overpower the party at the same time. Regardless of whatever burger you get (I got the Miyagi-san burger), it's going to be rich, juicy, and full of flavors.. . Don't even get me STARTED on the fries. No matter what kind of fries you get, they cook the fries to absolute crispy perfection. Their oxtail chili cheese fries, especially, is the best fries I've ever had. Oxtail meat, chili, aioli sauce, and French fries all on one plate with a fried egg on top? The combination itself sounds really weird at first, but it is so delicious and fitting that you'll wonder how no one has thought of it before. Even their fry sauce is amazing and nothing like you've ever tasted. Bachi Burger may be famous for their burgers, but their fries actually won me over.. . Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone! I wish I could be a regular customer. However, I will definitely be back another day.
Went here yesterday because it was near the south point casino. Saw it on DDD and was excited to try. My group had the spicy edamame, oxtail fries, Miyagi san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the Bahn Mi Burger, and the Kiki's Burger. . . Edamame was addicting. I call them Japanese french fries. . Miyagi burger was the most familiar thing I had tasted with the fried egg and onions on the burger.. The Bahn Mi burger was good with the strong taste of the pate being my only dislike.. The Kikl's Burger was tasty but the sauce was a little sweet for my taste.. The Oxtail fries were really good. theres something about a fried egg broken all over fries that just makes everything come together.. . Overall it was a good experience. Would like to go back and try the pork buns and the spicy miso burger. Will return soon.
BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!. . I am drooling just thinking about it.. . Ordered the ox-tail fries and kiki burger and both were really amazing!. . Fries portion was seriously enough for 3 people and burger was well portioned too! . . The sweet perfectly baked bun and Asian fusion flavors of the burger really were really spectacular and my taste buds were going crazy, YUM YUM YUM! The sauteed mushrooms and carmelized bacon marmalade were a perfect touch!. . Service could definitely use some work as the servers weren't that attentive or seemed happy at all. But the food was amazing enough to let me look pass that!. . Once the LA location in California opens up I'll definitely be visiting!
best gourmet burger in town.. Crews are awesome..  nice place and always clean.. food always delicious. I am totally recommended this place to anyone.. they always have good service to us everytime we go there.
HOLY COW. . . I have no idea where the bad reviews are coming from because bachi burger is the best burger I've ever had. It was Sunday afternoon and I was starting to regret waiting this long for a burger. My family and I waited for 45 minutes, but the moment I took a bite out of the miyagi-san burger, the pain my feet endured was history. The burger had several layers of textures to it. From the soft bun to the crispy onion rings, to the juicy burger, to the tart yet sweet sauce and finally down to the oozing goodness of the over easy egg--I am drooling as I describe this. . . Other than the burger, you must get the onion rings! In general, onion rings are tasty in almost any restaurant, but these are even tastier. The rings are battered lightly, and they're really crispy! . . As for customer service, Kelly the waitress was extremely helpful and kind to us. Our glasses were always full and she made sure we had everything we need. MAYBE the hostess had a little attitude, but it is totally understandable when people kept checking if their table was ready when she specifically said the wait would be 45 minutes. People need to either wait patiently or go to the Subways down the street.
Delicious!  The Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger was amazing!  Really loved the fresh sweet bun that all the burgers are served on and loved the huge portions of perfectly cooked fries!  I'll definitely be back!
BachiBurger is, by far, the best burger joint that I've ever been to. The Kiki burger is the best burger I've ever had, hands down. Just amazing. My friends tried their other burgers, such as The Miyagi burger, or The Ronin burger, and they were equally delighted by the deliciousness of it all.. . We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries, those were really good as well.. . No complaints on service, it was excellent, everyone was polite and helpful. Our waiter was a really cool dude.. . If you're in Vegas, you've got to go check this place out, it's a must. There is a little wait time, due to the popularity of the restaurant, but it is well worth the wait. BEST BURGER EVER.
One of the best burger restaurants ever! I couldn't finish the burger but it was soooo good! The truffle fries and oxtail fries were sooooo good! Our server Dan was the best!!! A must try!
Best lonely bird burger!  ... It's a lot to say if a non beef or pork eater loves this place.  Great beer selection.  Good service.
This place is amazing! Good service, good food and good atmosphere. I  ordered the bun mi burger and it did not disappoint. It was bursting with flavor. Every bite was delicious. Also had the chili cheese ox tail fries and they were just as delicious. I highly recommend trying this place.
A very special burger! !!  Maybe not for all occasions or cravings. I love it!  However the bun is too soft and too sweet to make the Burger totally awesome...
Rude. Unaccommodating. Mean. Horrible customer service due to the bald server wearing the blue flannel shirt. He needs to learn to refine his language to be less abrasive. Waited 40 minutes to be seated because we had six instead of five people and was told (very rudely)  that we would need to wait again. . . This isn't a rating on their food though. Wanted to try it but refuse to because of that guy. Horrible.
The coffee mint spiked shake is delicious. Had some of the usual favorites, oxtail chili fries and onion rings. Also tried the Bachi house salad for the first time and the vinaigrette dressing is so good and light.
Thanks mucho to Careline V. an awesome friend and amazing Yelpie for recommending I try Bachi while I'm in LV. Place was packed although my friend and I were able to be seated straight away. Nice comfortable atmosphere with one TV. Place is clean and to my eyes looks pretty new. Somewhat hidden in an unassuming strip mall. Food is anything but. The flavors in the burger I had which was theKiki smack you right in the face. So juicy and tender. Bun is very soft and warm. Although a good size did not feel stuffed or sluggish after I was done. Ordered a side of fries. Although I wanted to try the Ox tail which Jennifer C. mentioned to me. Next time ;-) To drink I got the Burton Baton by my favorite Brewery Dogfish Head. . . Service was excellent! A must stop off the Vegas strip!
In my opinion the best place in town to have a burger, however it's very busy so if you want to go I recommend you make a reservation.
Mediocre at best.  Have been looking forward to come here for a long time and I'm glad I did, because I won't be back.  The oxtail fries were great (hence why they got 3 stars) but the burgers were blah.  The meat was flavorless and is only complimented by the several different ingredients added to the burger.  The pork belly was pretty good but again mediocre because I can get this at Chinatown and it's just as good.  I really wish this place was as good as everyone says, but sorry, it's just not.
First off, Taylor, our waiter was very kind and accommodating. The food was very savory, full of flavor and absolutely delicious. The food took a while to come (almost an hour). We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, tantanmen ramen, spicy miso ramen and spicy miso burger. There was a mix up in the ramen orders and the waitresses that brought them out were very rude about it. I'm all about service and I was pretty shocked to get an attitude from them, especially when the mistake was on their end. No apology or anything. The food was so delicious though that we just brushed it off. You must order the chili cheese fries. It was sweet and savory. I wish there was more oxtail on it though. I had the spicy miso ramen. The broth was very rich and flavorful. It can get quite pricey with the add ons. It comes with chasu pork. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I had my fair share of ramen around Orange County and their pork beats them all. The noodles were cooked to perfection. It had the right amount of chewiness. Overall the food was great. I would definitely come back the next time I am in town but I hope for better service.
The second visit to Bachi Burger was not as good as the first visit. Not bad. Just not as great as we initially thought. ...I'm not a fan of their ketchup. ...Wifey said her chicken/turkey burger was good but not great.
I've been here a few times.  Great Burgers. They've got a lot of good items on their menu. Whenever I'm in Vegas I always stop here. Friendly staff
Service was great! Food was delicious. We ad the Ronin burgers and oxtail chili cheese fries. I had the Miyagi burger its  delicious and has this dressing on it.
Setting of the restaurant was pretty average but their food tho #onpoint. Ox tail chili cheese fries is a MUST try, meat is very tender and the cheese they use was a very soft tasting cheese and use thin slices of fresh jalapenos.  If you like spicy I would ask for extra jalapenos!. Also got the Banh mi burger, there is a dip that comes with the burger.  USE IT!! Not sure what that sauce was but looked kind of like fish sauce.. I will def be going back to try their pork belly/lamb steamed buns.. This place needs to expand either in LA, OC, or SD!!!!!!
Stopped here while we were driving through Vegas and wow! These burgers were incredible. Easily the best burgers I have ever had. Everything we ordered was delicious. I had the Kiki burger which was fantastic. My boyfriend got the Black and Green burger (wagyu beef, spinach, blue cheese, bacon)--also delicious. We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the brussel sprouts---once again, amazing! The fries has a delicious cremini cream sauce drizzled over them and a great aioli for dipping. If you're a burger person, you can't skip this place! Definitely a different burger experience than the norm.
By far the best burger ive EVER tasted. Everytime im in town in vegas, this is usually my first stop for lunch. Absolutely delicious. Every burger just has so many bursting flavors from the patty to whats with the burger to their sweet bun. . . I usually order the crabby patty, but its not in season. Sooo I ordered the kiki burger (angus beef, with eryngii mushrooms and caramelized bacon) with a side of truffle fries which is just as delicious. But what took me by surprise was the Mr. HO burger which I really need to order next time. Its the burger with a taro bun, I had a bite from my cousins and wow, amazing. . . I genuinely love this place. A family own restaurant and great service. Came here when it just opened and ive been raving about this place so im extremely late on my review. Anyways, excited to have bachi burger open in LA, just hoping its just as good as the original.
This is my second time coming to Bachi Burger. The Truffle french fries is a must for any newcomers. I get the Angus burger and add the blue cheese, yummy.
Oxtail fries. Just shut up and order them. Don't question it, just get them. Your meal and your overall quality of life will be better once you eat them.. . Anyway, I love this place. It's right down the street from my house and definitely holds a special place in all of our hearts. . . My first time going there I got the Ronin burger, which I definitely recommend. It's delicious. It's salty, sweet, crunchy, soft, juicy, tangy, refreshing, gooey, and messy. It's everything you want in a burger. . . Seriously, Bachi burger is great. It's got a cool vibe inside, they have a good beer selection and a great menu of delicious, un-pretentious food. . . Just go there.
The burgers here are probably the best burgers I have ever had, very flavorful with a creative presentation; but they take forever getting the food out along with terrible service. We were on the waiting list for 10 minutes being told that there are no tables or bar seats available, but a couple comes in after us and they quickly seat them at a bar. I of course complained and they really didn't do anything special which was upsetting of course. When we finally get a table and order, we waited for 20 minutes for the food to arrive. If they had better service, I'd give them 5 stars because their burgers are beyond wonderful; but I unfortunately can't because of the terrible experience I had.
Went last night. Keep in mind I've been here dozens of times.  Our server didn't give a hoot about our table of five. We ordered the pickles and they were slimy. Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like "hi! Um.....nooooo". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky "manager".
Went here for the first time a few months back. I had never heard of it and had no expectations other than some of my friend saying it was a really good burger place. . . Went with a group of about 15 so we had to wait about 20-25 minutes which was fine considering our group took a little while to filter in. . . Everyone on yelp and in person raved about the oxtail chili cheese fries. So we got a couple orders to share amongst the group. All I had to say was... OMG!! The chili was flavorful. The fries were my perfectly fried in my opinion: nice and crispy on the outside with the right amount of creamy potato goodness on the inside. The oxtail moist and delicious. . . Per the server's suggestion, I ordered the Miyagi-San for my burger. When it came, it looked good. It was a pretty hefty burger. But, nothing will compare to that first bite. I died. It felt like the perfect fusion of a burger and Asian flavors. Perfectly cooked to my medium-rare order. Juicy. Savory. Simply amazing. . . A lot of people compare it to Umami Burger over here in CA. In my opinion, I liked Bachi better. But I hear it's a pretty close race and all a matter of preference (much like the in-n-out / shake shack debate). . . Fast forward to this past weekend.... . I took a group of friends who had never been here before. I told them it was definitely worth the price (~$10-$26 for a burger). . . We got a few appetizers because it was our only meal that day. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and pork belly buns. . . While all delicious, the pork belly buns were definitely the hit! The pork belly was so moist and melted in your mouth. For some, these were the highlight of the whole meal!. . For our burgers, a lot of my friends ordered the Miyagi-San per my suggestion and they loved it! The few that ordered something different (myself included; spicy miso, kalbi, and banh mi burgers) still thought they were good, but not to the same degree as the Miyagi-San. . . Would definitely recommend this to everyone whenever they're in Vegas! And I hope the one in LA is completed soon so I can treat my stomach to this amazingness more often!
Awesome food and service. We had pork belly buns, oxtail chile fries, shogun and spicy miso burgers.All are must have!
First thing I ate after landing in Vegas.  Totally worth the 8 hour trip from the East Coast.  We got here around 9pm on a Wednesday and there was no wait.  . . I had the Ronin Burger.  Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, and a fried egg on a burger.  I think I destroyed the burger within a few minutes and it was a decent size.  Every burger shop should add fried eggs on their burgers.  It was sweet and refreshing.  Maybe a little too sweet for my liking, but overall a good burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi-san burger.  With the onion rings, the burger looked massive.  The furikake (seasoning) went very well with the burger.  I had a bite of the burger and the taste still lingered as we walked back to our car.  Next time I'm getting this burger.   . . As a pork bun enthusiast, I naturally had to order them.  I like Bachi Burger's version of the steam pork bun.  The bun was not soft and fluffy but the pork, egg, and herbs totally blew my mind.  Like I said earlier, eggs should be added be everything.. . I'm very glad I went here after my flight.  Totally worth the food coma while driving 3 hours to Zion National Park.
This place hits the spot. It is not good as Umami burger, in my opinion, but the Ronin burger was amazing. I cleared the plate within minutes. I did not like the truffle fries as much as I had hoped to. However, the service was awesome and fast. We came in during lunch time and got a table right away. But, there are always lines, so beware!
I have been here around 4 times in the last 3 years. The service use to be really slow but now the service timeliness is very reasonable. Apparently they completed some renovations eight months ago and that probably helped the restaurant become more efficient.. . My go to burger is the ronin burger, can't go wrong with that burger. I should probably try other items but why fix something that isn't broken? Also truffle fries are awesome! . . The staff here are very friendly and try to strike up conversations with the customers, that's always pleasant.. . All in all, I will come here again. Especially because tourists seem to love it. My cousin Jackie for instance, she claims its the best burger joint ever!.
I love the food here. The oxtail fries is a must and the $26 Shogun Burger was worth every bite!
The food at Bachi Burger is once again the star of the show!  The taste, temperature, and presentation were PERFECT once again!  The Myagi is my favorite burger!  Fries were perfect, loved the pineapple ketchup, and a peanut butter and chocolate milkshake!.    The gentlemen at the counter, I assume the manager, GETS IT!  Our waitress, eh The wobbly table, eh.  Otherwise I would have given Bachi Burger 5 stars.  It's worth the wait!  Always!  The burgers and fries are worth every penny!  There were 6 of us!  We will be back.
Best burgers I've ever had!  Love the truffle fries, the pork belly bun, And the drinks are yummy, Katsushiro is my favorite drink!  We eat there about 2-3 times a month.
Bachi Burger is a burger place with an asian fusion theme. I've been here once and the Summerlin location once. Ive tried 2 of their burgers: Miyagi-san Burger and the Banh Mi Burger. The Miyagi-san Burger was pretty good..wagyu beef, chili mayo, caramelized bacon, fried onion rings, fried egg, and furikake seasoning if i remember correctly. The crispy onion rings, gooey egg, and saltiness of the bacon matched really well. When I finished the burger, I thought I had like a "loco moco" version of a burger with onion rings (minus the gravy). The Banh Mi burger knocked it out of the park..shrimp and pork patty with nuoc mam (i think thats how its spelled?) sauce and pickled veges. This was probably the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. It got better with every bite. As I was eating it, I was intrigued that i was eating a burger but the flavors REALLY DID remind me of the banh mi sandwich (which makes u think of the french bread cut lengthwise and eating it hot dog style). The resto is also know for their oxtail fries which i will try on my next visit. . . The resto has a nice, cozy feel with some tvs. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The only thing I would have to say negative is the boba drinks are a little too pricey.. . Overall, Bachi Burger is the best burger place I've been to since moving to Vegas.
I might have had a better burger, but I don't remember when.  Best burger in Las Vegas!
This May be my shortest review ever, but these may be some of the best burgers I have ever had. I want to go back to Vegas just to get some more burgers. drool.....
look at all the pics. nuff said!
