I am a big Beatles fan. I have also had the soundtrack album for this show for years before finally getting a chance to actually see the show. I was very excited to finally go. Call me biased, call me the right audience for this show, whatever. This show is amazing!. . As soon as you walk in you're immersed in Beatles history. A huge multi-colored light up walkway takes you towards the bar serving several Beatles-themed cocktails. Entering the arena (in the round) you're confronted by four large sheets with projected images of the Beatles on them. In the background you can hear mostly instrumental Beatles songs, which put me in the mood to hear an hour and a half of Beatles music. They did exactly what I would have done; they played almost exclusively Beatles songs NOT featured in the show itself, which I appreciated.. . Everything about the pre-show sets you up for the fun and exhilarating show to follow. An actor walking in the crowd snuck behind an audience member and sat in his seat before he could. It was this type of unnecessary fun that made the entire experience fantastic. The show itself starts with a haunting display of acrobats slowly descending from the ceiling and ascending from the floor on wires in slow motion to the song "Because" but only the vocals.. . Soon after the show bursts to life. I won't ruin it for you. You should go see it. There was so much visual spectacle happening at once that my girlfriend and I often didn't even know which amazing stunt to look at! A note: watch the guy on the swing high above the stage, it will make your heart stop. I was overwhelmed by the amazing acrobatics happening in front of me. The people at Cirque know how to dazzle.
Aesthetically gorgeous show  with a  large cast performing in a unique wheel-shaped stage, set to Beatles music- you don't need to be a superfan to appreciate and enjoy an amazing night here, nor do you have to shell out for any particular seating section as they all offer amazing views. In fact, I'd sit further back to be able to take in more than just what's right in front of your seat.. . Lucked into some amazing second-row seats via a generous Yelper (thanks Janel!) and spent the evening swiveling my head back and forth and up and everywhere trying to take in all of the action. At times there are up to 30 performers on stage or in the air with no central focus point, as such it seems like it would translate to one of the few shows worth seeing more than once, as you could easily see things you missed before.. . Favorite parts:. "Strawberry Fields Forever" with bubbles. "Here Comes The Sun" with candles. "Octopus's Garden" with lights. "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" almost a literal interpretation. . Consistently rated one of the best shows in Vegas, recommended as one of the best Cirque shows, LOVE lives up to the hype-  and then some!. . TIP: Don't get a drink in the lobby, you don't want your bladder to force you to miss any of the scenes!
Must see, simply amazing, and the middle 15 minutes are probably as close to doing acid as I'll ever get! . . I'm actually a little embarrassed that it took me so long to finally see this.  Stop thinking and just go. . . Pro tip: sign up for the Mirage players club/card and get 30% off tickets without having a gamble a single dollar.
This show was amazing, it was so action packed and so subtle all at the same time. So much goes into this production I'm sure and you truly shows how professional and good they are at what they do. My only complaint is the seats are small so your close to the Person next to you but you will hardly notice with all that's going on. I'm not sure about the price of tickets as this was a comp so I can't speak on that part but I'm sure it's worth whatever they charge. It's a 1 and a 1/2 hour show with no breaks so you will really enjoy the time spent here. Good job to the crew that perform here on a daily basis. You truly are incredible at what you do.
This was my second Cirque de Soleil show and it was very entertaining! If you're a fan of The Beatles, then you would absolutely love this show. It's a full 90 minutes of songs, acts, and dancing. The seating of the theater circled a full 360 around the stage, so every seat should have gotten a good view of the show. We sat in section 205 row N, and the view was perfect. It was far enough back to see everything going on, but close enough so that you don't feel distant from all the performers. I would recommend sitting in a similar section. . . There is a concession stand where you could buy drinks andpopcorn, but be sure to come a little earlier because the lines do get long! If you're not in your seats by show time you'll have to wait like 5 minutes into the show to sit down. If you have your mlife player's card, I believe you get a little discount on your purchase. . . The show itself was amazing. The only thing I would complain about was that their wasn't as much acrobatics and "keep you on the edge of you seat" acts. But for the amount of space they had, they were able to do some crazy acts! Nonetheless, the show was very entertaining. It told a story of an era in a very theatrical and awe inspiring way. Would definitely recommend people to see it.
My favorite show I've seen thus far on the strip.  Granted I'm partial to the Beatles so it would make sense this one would stand out to me :-)  But I also could have easily been let down as I went into the show with very high expectations.  Cirque did not disappoint!  The performances were very lively and fun.  I highly recommend this show...especially if you're a true Beatles fan!
Best Cirque Show (and I have seen them ALL). O is great, KA with the boards and story interesting, Michael Jackson, depressing. . . This was fun, engaging, well-planned and great music. Upbeat, slow songs and just when you thought you have had enough...bam? There is more. . . We had seats towards the back but still felt included. The theatrics were suburb, the music not too deafening, the actors came into the audience, it was all a great time. I love shows where you are sad and surprised it is all over!. . If you love, heck even like the Beattles go!. . Cannot wait to go see it again.
This was such an amazing amazing show that completely lived up to the hype.   I won't ruin the show but the creative minds that put it all together knew exactly what they were doing.  The atmosphere is what I imagine an actual Beatles concert would have been like.  . . This is an absolute must for any level of Beatles fan.  I will definitely be seeing it again.
Worth. Every. Penny! I would fly in just to see this show again. There was so much going on at all times on the stage and in the air that you can see it 5 times and still probably have missed something. It was the highlight of our recent 5 days in Vegas by far. I'm a Beatles music fan, so I couldn't get enough of it. And I took my 14-year-old daughter and she equally loved it. So I think there's something for everyone. If I go back to Vegas and this show is still playing, I'd do it all over again.
It was beautiful to watch!! Great theatrical vision! Beautiful dancing and the music paired so well with the dancing. The story telling was great.
I always say that "O" is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but I can't help but say that this is my favorite, too.  It's just not fair to compare the two!  This show is so FUN!  We've been 3 times now, and there just isn't a bad seat in the house.  This show brings history, classic Beatles music, dance, and acrobatics like you've never seen before!  My husband and I are huge Beatles fans, so it's easier for us to love this show, but we took my parents who aren't that into the Beatles, and they absolutely LOVED it!  It's a must see!
A great show. Very upbeat feeling and great acts. I would recommend to anyone, even if you're not a huge Beatles fan.
I really wanted to like this show especially with all the positive reviews. But I don't know why I just didn't feel like it was all that spectacular. It was colorful and all but the music seem too loud. The acts were not tied together too smoothly. There were times that I felt it was just too long. Perhaps it's personal taste. I did like zarkana.
Loved the show!!!! The best part about this particular show is the audience engagement. I absolutely loved the huge blanket covering the whole show. Who doesn't love the Beatles?! Great dancers, great costumes and best music.
