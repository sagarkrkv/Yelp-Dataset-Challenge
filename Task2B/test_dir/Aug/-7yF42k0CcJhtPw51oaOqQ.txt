I will never again stay at the Bellagio even if they paid me to stay. I was meeting friends for a Bachlorette party and my flight into Vegas was delayed so they asked the front desk for another key and left it for me to pick up. When I finally picked up the key and got to my room, the key didn't work. I called the front desk and waited 30 minutes for security. When they finally got there, they told me they couldn't let me in because the room wasn't in my name. How does a hotel mess up activating a god damn room key?? I am livid
Great hotel, beautifully maintained,  Pool was very nice, with plenty of chairs (august).  Beds are very comfortable and turndown service is nice (love how they turned the tv channel to the tranquility music channel each night).   . . I will say the checkin procedures needs revamped.  Its one big free for all with no lines.   Needs more structure to checkin like Aria next door (one line).   Too many guests get to the front and take forever chit chatting while people people next to you zip on by.   Thats probably my only big complaint...please fix checkin process.
LOOOOOOVE this hotel.. . If you want to get the best customer service possible, be treated like royalty, and experience amazing restaurants, this is the hotel to go to.. . The difference between Bellagio and the other hotels? Elegance. Classiness. The people who stay here are classy: you don't get stumbling drunk people, or weirdos security needs to watch...it's just the normal, put together people who like to enjoy Vegas from an non-girls-gone-wild perspective.. . The lobby is gorgeous...check out the ceiling and beautiful fountains and flower displays. The restaurants (DO NOT MISS OLIVES!) serve delicious food with a classy touch.. . You don't smell cigarette smoke ANYWHERE...not even in the Casinos. For someone who can't stand the smell....huge win.. . They have the largest chocolate fountain in the world...according to Guiness Book of World records...enough said.. . The rooms: beautiful!! So well done....spacious and with a marble floor entry way. Bathrooms are huge with a shower and separate tub to soak in...really nice.. . Best part...the beds....OMG. When you lay down, you just sink into the bed (where the hell do they get those mattresses?) and the pillows and mattress seep into every crevice of your neck and back, almost knowing where you need support the most. I had some of the best sleep ever in Bellagio beds.. . Point of the story: Bellagio hotel is excellent on every level. I recommend this hotel to any other on the strip, We'll be staying here every time.
I have been staying here since it opened and I love it here. The restaurants are always consistent and great. You can tell from the second you walk into the hotel it is an upscale place. The decor is also top notch. I really like how they remodeled the rooms and updated them. The service here is also great. I have never had a bad experience here in all the years I have been staying here. The pool is great and a of fun. I also love that their prices have dropped from what they once were. I strongly suggest staying here. You won't be let down.
Beautiful fountains, cool art inside, they also have an ice cream and sweets shop! A very elegant and classy hotel overall
My husband and I frequent 4 and 5 star hotels hotels when we travel, and we like our date nights in Chicago, so we have a good basis for ratings.  We stayed in a suite in the newer tower late April for an Elton John concert...a bucket list for me.  As we walked in our room, both of us said this is by far the best room so far.  Nice view of the desert, and spacious room - 3 bathrooms!  The hotel is grand and beautiful.  We will definitely stay here if we go back.
No one does it better than Bellagio.  We've stayed here a few times and it's become the ONLY place we'll stay when visiting Vegas.  We've had Deluxe Fountain View Suites and the two-bedroom Penthouse Suites and they are all amazing.  The service is impeccable, the staff amazing and the hotel stunning.
Moi c'est tout comme Camille L.!. . Une fois de temps en temps, un peu de Bling-Bling ne vous tue pas. Bien au contraire, un peu de Bling-Bling peut beaucoup vous amuser! Et au Bellagio, c'est le carton plein assure! Un chouette casino, un hotel kitschissime (mais j'ai encore fait pire a Vegas, je vous assure!), bref, de quoi reussir votre sejour.. . Mais si vous voulez profiter du Bellagio sans payer, il existe une alternative: allez profiter du spectacle des fontaines a l'exterieur: les jeux d'eau des fontaines sur "Con Te Partiro", c'est quand meme beau :).. Le spectacle des jeux d'eau est tous les quarts d'heure entre 20h et minuit.. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whqgVUuIN9M
Beautiful hotel is like a resort no complaints ever , excellent service, excellent price, excellent locations  only thing you need is to have enough Energy to do everything, drink, dance, gamble, swimming, party, do it all.
Recommend this hotel.  Excellent service, food, and comfortable rooms.  It is also near the tram so traveling along the Strip is easy.
This is one of the premier Casino-Hotels in Las Vegas and could be considered a vegas landmark.  Everyone knows the Bellagio fountains.... But did you know this Casino has the best selection of restaurants of all the Casinos in town?  Michael Mina, Olives, Jasmine, Picasso, sensi, Fix, the list goes on.  Not to mention a little 24 hour cafe in the back by the sports book for the hardcore gamblers.. Throw on top of that a world class buffet, best poker room in town and a garden?  You don't have to leave Bellagio for the full vegas experience!
Really nice.  Very accommodating.  Comfortable beds and rooms.  Lots to see and do.  Probably the nicest smelling casino in Las Vegas - only smoke or stale odors is if one is standing next to a smoker or drunk... and there are virtually none of those.  Beautiful swimming pools.  Exceptional check-in clerks, bellmen and valets.  Also exceptional... the room service!
Pluses:. . * Beautiful hotels and rooms.. * Friendly staff.. . Minuses:. . * Takes forever to check-in to this hotel (50 minutes).. * "Self check out" process does not allow you to get an emailed receipt. So, after you self check out, you still need to go to the desk and wait in line to talk to a clerk to get a receipt! Useless!. * Cigarette smoke all over the place!. . Great hotel, but poor check in and check out procedures!
Best hotel ever? We wanted two double bed rooms next to each other, which they didn't have, so they upgraded us to a king sized room with an attached double bed with an amazing view of the fountain. Though at one point they claimed that we consumed a bottle of Jack from the mini fridge and said they will charge even though we didn't even touch it. But over all excellent hotel!
The Bellagio is top notch! This is the only place we stay when in Vegas. Comfortable, elegant, and a great location on the strip. The pool cafe has great food for lunch. Bellagio is definitely the place to stay when visiting Vegas. You can't go wrong with this choice!
My first overnight at the Bellagio, and I have got to say ... IT WAS AWESOME!  I'm usually swayed by some super-low-rates or new casino promotions at other properties, and I like to earn my Starwood points at the Westin, but this time everyone was at the Bellagio for a recent family get-together, so I joined in..   . My recommendation to fellow Yelpers is to go for the Belllagio Suite.  Not the penthouse or anything crazy, just the basic Bellagio Suite.  These are plenty of promotions and discount codes out there; you'll end up paying about 1.5 times the price of a regular room, and you are going to thank me!  My promotion (Bellagio Summer) included a $100 food and beverage credit.  Yes, there is a $28 "resort fee," but everyone seems to have that nowadays.  But, you say, I'm never in the room anyway except to sleep.  Hear me out, I say.  Here's why the suite life is so sweet:. . 1.  Preferred Check-in.  The Bellagio lobby, though pretty, is always in a state of pandemonium.  Suite guests get their own "Invited Guest" line which was never mobbed during my four day stay.  Totally worth it to whisk in and out.   Fancier suite guests get their own check-in room, but no need to go there.  . . 2.  Front of line pass.  The Bellagio buffet is, I suppose, a must do.  When my group arrived, there were over 300 people in the buffet line, snaking out along the casino.  The VIP line, for high rollers and other cool guests like you, had not one guest in it.  Suite holders get a free front of line pass, good for the buffet and the Bellagio Cafe.  Worth its weight in crab legs!  We were inside and seated within two minutes.  . . 3.  The room.  Suites are on high floors, 27 and up, and have their own elevator banks.  Even the suite hallways are different, and, not to sound boy scoutish about it, they are just beautiful; my friends from lower floors were astounded.  We did not spring for the much pricier Fountain View suites (for eyeballing the famed Bellagio fountains), but the standard view suite (of the Rio and beyond) is pretty awesome.  Even for a jaded Vegas Yelper, the suite furnishings and size will take your breath away.  Three bathrooms, a huge 600SF living room with furniture I would like to have, and separate 600SF bedroom with super comfy beds.  I'm a sucker for that TV-in-the-bathroom-mirror thing, and there are two.  . . OK, enough already, give it a try.  A hit!
One of the most beautiful hotels ever, this place is a must stop just to see their beautiful fountain show and the indoor structure and attractions.  i love this place, super gorgeous! The botanical garden was well maintained, had the most beautiful flowers and just everything about it total jaw dropper. A must see that's all I have to say!
Only reason for 4 stars is the food lines are always so cluttered and not very well directed. . . Other than that. Lobby is perfect with the Dale Chihuly glass art. I always go to the store, and garden. Those are always my first stops!
They have nice stores inside the casino. And definitely nice arts and buffet is good at this place.
Favorite hotel in Vegas! Top notch all around...Deluxe Fountain View rooms are the cats meow. Can't go wrong at The Bellagio...
The fountain is the saving grace of this hotel. The hotel and especially the customer service is in need of a MAJOR over haul. . . They need to take a lesson from Aria for customer service.
My first time staying here was for my dad's birthday. It's almost an annual or biannual trip for us, and we've stayed at many different hotels. More times than not, we get invitations from the hotels themselves for free nights due to player's credit. And I was so excited to come and stay at the Bellagio because this has been my favorite hotel since I've saw the water show many many years ago. So my expectations were high.. . Parking is free, goes without saying like all of the hotels in Vegas. Casino is beneath all the parking levels, so level 1-2 is usually full. Registrations were readily packed but we had no problem checking in. We walked through the blackjack tables to the elevators. You must show the security guard your room key to enter the elevators.. . !!! We walked down a long hallway to get to our room. Once we walked in there and within 2 minutes I noticed there were opened water bottles, wet towels, used and open shampoo and conditioner bottles in the shower- I mean the room was half-a** cleaned. Was not what I expecting from a high-end hotel. Disappointed.. . There check-in and check-out lines are the same. Such a hassle to check-out when there's always a crowd of people :\. . Besides that, the pools are gorgeous. There are like 4 different pools and 4 hot sauna. Buffet, dessert with the chocolate foundation, cafe shop, Cartier, ALL them brand named stores. Free but slow wifi in the rooms. Also the hotel is located in the center of the strip, across from Planet Hollywood (good dining options), I would stay again, can't keep me away :)
We stayed here the weekend of August 15th and we had a great experience. It is a beautiful hotel and the service is beyond excellent. The rooms were modern and the bed was very comfortable. Our room only had one bath robe so we called the front desk for another one and they actually brought us two more within like five minutes that were the same robes they use in the spa and they were heavenly! Much better than the regular ones in the room when you get there. But this hotel is crowded all the time! There are so many people walking through that you are very slowed down when you're trying to leave. None of the other hotels we visited over the weekend were as crowded as the Bellagio. Also, our visit to the pool was very disappointing. There were no lounge chairs available and getting a drink took a very long time. But overall we were very pleased with our stay here.
The attentive service and authentic interactions of Bellagio staff with guests makes for a memorable experience.  What makes Bellagio outstanding are how many people stop and take the time to say hello and also attend to handicapped guests.  KUDOS Bellagio for providing a complimentary wheelchair and finding so many ways  to assist guests with disabilities.  You make Vegas distances doable.
This place is good for families, and people who want a clean, more upscale Vegas experience. It has some stunning attractions. -the indoor atrium with amazing flower sculptures and bird collection( gotta take the kids). . -pool/ gardens are idk lovely is a good word for them. Closes at 8pm. . -GREAT dining. I love Japanese food, if you do too then do not leave this city without eating at Yellowtail! Best place...expensive, but stunning flavor. . -Spa is very nice. I got a massage, seaweed wrap and detox mani/pedi. Stay away From the wrap unless uve had it before and liked it. Basically you will be a stinky human sushi roll, not fun. Get either Staci or Taylor to do your nails, they are beautiful, funny, and great to talk to while you get some quality paint. . Shopping is great, bellagio fountains are incredible(I waited 30mins. Just to watch them a 2nd time, and I'm impatient). . Rooms are smaller, but classy, clean, with free wifi. Tasteful. . To eat: Olives is good. The chocolate fountains are great. Yellowtail is supreme.
As it promises this is one of the best places in Vegas to stay. Awesome pools with parks  that make each of them more private. Really clean, modern and very good service. The food also amazing and the ice cream bar is one of the best ice creams I tried in America.  Will come back if possible!
I don't see what's not to like.  The public rooms are a cut above the other hotels. The chandeliers are made of beautiful Murano glass from Venice.  The marble is Italian and top quality.  All the public areas are spectacular and interesting while the bedrooms are tasteful, lovely and with subdued colors.  Our stunning suite had a beautiful mini kitchen with lovely marble and 5 star appliances.  We had 4 separate bathrooms with a powder room.  Again the beautiful colors of brown, tan, vanilla and caramel were so beautiful and soothing.  The beds were perfect with comfy down pillows and opulent bedding.. . Even the shampoos and soaps had a glorious scent and were classy.  The art and furnishings were lovely and didn't seem manufactured.  I have zero complaints.  Of course it is a mammoth hotel with throngs of people everywhere.  If that bothers you, then you'll need to find a nice hotel off the strip.. . This place is exceptionally well-managed.  For such a large hotel, when you ask for your car to arrive, the valet has it there within a couple of minutes.  Kudos to management and staff here.. . My only recommendation to the manager is to have a coffee maker in the kitchen.
Overall I was not very impressed with the Bellagio. Like many hotels in Vegas, the place smelled of smoke. My eyes were irritated the entire weekend from being in the hotel. Check in and out took a long time. The rooms themselves are nice. They are big and pretty modern. Also, they said our room was a partial fountain view, but I would easily consider it a full fountain view! However, the hotel is very noisy (and no I am not talking about the fountains, don't mind that noise at all). While you could not hear the music the fountains were dancing to, you could hear all the rest of the noise from their nightclub Hyde as well as the strip, sirens all night long, etc. Our friends had a room on the other side of the hotel not facing the strip and were woken up every morning by the sound of bottles being crushed at a recycling plant. The food was ok, but nothing exceptional. I just expected the hotel and the experience to be a bit nicer and classier than it was.
The location isGREAT. Bellagio sits in the heart of the Las Vegas strip. Check-in on a Monday evening was relatively fast. My room was nice. I asked to be near an elevator and I was accommodated (the hallways at many Vegas hotels are LONG!). ...My room was clean but not "five-star" in my book. ...Used the pool often in my two-night stay. Service at the pool was good Tuesday with server "Alyshia" - but I went un-acknowledged the next day by a different girl. ...The pool area is way more family oriented here than at many Vegas hotels I've stayed at. The music at the pool is not loud or aggressive. ...Room service corned beef hash was super-good!!!! Service was prompt on a Wednesday at 4:15 am.
Just got back from a wonderful stay at Bellagio. Got upgraded to an awesome suite!! Great time and will be back again.
The Bellagio is a gorgeous hotel from the moment my family car pulled up to their entrance. The valet staff was very accommodating and pleasant throughout our whole stay. Their lobby is quite a feast for the eyes, my only complaint was that it's always ridiculously crowded: tourists and hotel guests alike. It was a bit hard to feel welcome pushing past bodies after bodies to get to the elevator. The suite we stayed at is absolutely breathtaking. We had a living room, three bedrooms, and four bathrooms; it was quite spacious. The furnitures are impeccable and the decor have a warm feeling. The pools surprisingly were not crowded and there were a lot of chaise available for lounging and sunbathing. In conclusion everything was great and Bellagio had made my first Las Vegas stay memorable and fun. In the future I'd love to stay here again but with a smaller room for a different feel.
Bad customer service from the front desk staff!  . Excellent view since we paid for fountain view!  . Free snail speed wifi.. . We checked in, walked up to our room and see cups of alcohol and opened wine bottles on the counter top.  It's obvious that either the room has not been clean or it is still being occupied. . . We left the room immediately (in case it is still being occupied) and picked up a house phone to call the front desk.  They apologized, gave us a new room, and told us that our key card will work for the new room.  . . And of course the key card does not work.  Call the front desk again and they send security over to open the door for us after verifying our ID.  He suggested us to call front desk to request a bell boy to deliver a new key card to us to save us a trip to the front desk.  So we called the front desk and waited in our room. . . After 45 minutes of waiting we decided to give them a call.  The person on the phone said it could be that the bell boy is busy with other requests.  Sooo disappointed.  In Vegas, We've stayed at Paris, Mandalay Bay(The Hotel), Venetian, Encore, The Wynn, and have never encounter this before!  What a way to kick off our three night stay!
Over all it's a nice hotel, very Vegas. Even if you're not a guest of the hotel try the Buffet. Loved the breakfast buffet there. . However, the rooms are rather small. Luxor and Rio's rooms are double the size than this one, in the same price range. Also, they charge additional $25 a day for internet + gym entrance AND ANOTHER extra $29 for spa entrance (Rio, for example, included the spa and gym in the price of the room)
Finally I got to stay here ( always outside watching the water show) Nice standard room, we paid $160.
