A friend purchased tickets for myself and my wife as a gift. When I showed up to will call the lady at the counter checked my ID and confirmation number which were correct, the proceeded to ask for the credit card which of course I did not have because it was a gift. She was insistent on not letting us inside even though I showed all my information and told her it was a gift. I asked to speak with a manager who said the same thing, she even had the audacity to tell me to pay for them again on the spot. These tickets were almost 200$ each!!! A gentlemen next to me picking up tickets showed solely his ID and was able to pick up his tickets with no issue. We left without being able  to see the show, which I'm sure is a great one. But we'll never know. The customer service or lack thereof is appalling. We were so excited to be able to see this highly reviewed show and left without seeing it and not even an apology, I will not recommend this cirque du soleil at least KA to anyone. Be careful if you're buying tickets as a gift or getting one as a gift!
Our family of 5 went to this show.  We really enjoyed it.  The theatre was impressive even before the show began.  We were all amazed at the stage and what they could do with it.  The performances were awesome. . . Two reasons for not giving it 5 stars: price and tempo.  The tempo was kind of slow at times, when it was rockin it was really rockin but when it was slow I got sleepy.  And the price, the price ($100 each) made it tough for me to enjoy it when I have to buy 5 tickets.  That's not their fault but it's how I felt.  . . We saw "V the variety show" the next night ($50 each) and, frankly, it was a lot more entertaining.  The whole family loved it.
This is the second time I've seen KA and sadly they totally changed the ending of the show! Yes they had a major accident last year with the death of a cast member. But as many yelpers have mentioned they literally took out the best scene in the entire show and replaced it with some cheap blurry CGI wannabe fight scene! I mean cmon isn't this suppose to be Vegas?? Go BIG OR GO HOME! The show also seemed to lack that energy level I remember when they first opened. Maybe they've lost that passion after performing for so long. Yes i was literally falling asleep instead of staying engaged during our show. . . Knowing the and personally knowing and meeting the original caste members they would definitely be disappointed in what the show has turned into.. . Anyway for those considering seeing this show i would say save your money or at least do NOT pay full price and use those deal sites or book through mlife. You will be disappointed if you pay for this one.
Saw Ka last night for the second time and I left feeling very disappointed (and kind of duped). I was traveling with friends/family and invested in VIP tickets so they could share the same experience I had when I saw Ka the first time. Well, had I known they completely removed the vertical fight scene, I would have never spent the kind of money I did. I understand after the 2013 tragedy the show must go on, but be up front with customers about it. The low-quality video that replaced the most amazing scene I have personally ever seen on a stage was a huge let-down. It was confusing and appeared a short-cut in the entire story line. I genuinely hope they someday revert to the life action that made Ka the most impressive Cirque show in Vegas. In the meantime, "O" is back on top.
My mission is to see every Cirque show there is :-). . I LOVED KA!  It had a great story and the action really kept me on the edge of my seat and turning in circles to see the action all over the theater.  I was anxious to see the big fight scene at the end.  I had read about the performer who died last year during that scene.  So I have to admit that I was disappointed that they replaced that whole scene with a video.. . But... I get it.  A person died.  Maybe that was the resolution to ensure everyone's safety and still keep the show going.. . Still an excellent show and I would totally go watch it again.
The theatre is beautiful and the staff fantastic, but I was very disappointed with the lack of acrobatics in this cirque show. As a theatrical production, it has a great storyline, breathtaking sets and great costuming. But, as a cirque show I was left wanting more. The most entertaining part was the men on the spinning contraption, flipping and jump roping through the air. MYSTERE at Treasure Island is a better show.
Saw this show tonight. It was a little slower than I expected but we went to the 930 show so maybe I was just sleepy. The show was good but the end CGI sequence was a waste. It made the ending super confusing. After reading other reviews I guess they changed it, kind of wish we would have picked another show...
Wonderful show... simply mind blowing! Don't miss this jaw dropping experience.
I thought this was going to be like an average Cirque Du Soleil show and I've seen a bunch of them.  But it wasn't average at all.  It was amazing!!  I was blown away by it.  I don't want to give too much away but the stage was so cool.  I would definitely recommend this show to everyone.  Also, don't take your seat right away.  Stay outside and a little before the show, performers come out and play the World's Largest Harp.  It's located outside the bar, you have to look up.  It was pretty cool.  Overall, one of the best things I've ever done in Vegas (and I've been dozens of times).
Loved it.  The entire experience from the time the doors to the theater open and all the staff helping people get seated are all in costumes and character,  to the fact that the whole theatre is used as a stage during the show not just one linear stage.  Theres a lot going on and it was very very enjoyable to watch.  Even go so far as to have a very creative and entertaining way to discourage camera and cell phone use during the show. It was visually amazing to see and we were both impressed and enjoyed the show.  It doesnt seem like there would be any bad seats but we were in the middle of the theater as well as center stage and the view was awesome. I would highly recommend it!
Wonderful!. . What a show! Easy entrance. The employees are SO nice! They're very helpful and funny when finding your seat. They talk and joke around with everyone in the audience. . . The show is spectacular. I love the story line and the costumes. These performers are so talented and strong. They really put on a great show. I don't want to give too much away, but I really can't imagine anyone not enjoying the show. Just go, and you will enjoy it. There's a lot of effort put into the story, the performance, and the stage set up and you can tell!. . The only thing, is that one of the last scenes includes some sort of projection screen of people climbing up and down the wall. This is the scene that was previously the actual performers doing the acts going up and down, but has been changed to projection since Sarah Guillot-Guyard passed away. It's a very traumatizing thing to have a performer pass during the act. I almost feel that they should just remove the scene altogether. But it is not my decision. . . The other thing... If you play MyVegas you should use your points on this! I used mine on two tickets for the show and we got row D seats 1 and 2. It was a fantastic location and the tickets retailed at $140 each! Can't go wrong with a great cirque show for free in Vegas.
Ok, really? Shadow Puppets on the Vegas Strip?. Really, I'm Serious.. A Video game - it was like watching your kids play on their playstation 3.. . I would not suggest any one pay their hard earned money to see KA. Two thumbs down... Go see Mystere at Treasure Island.  . . The Story line was aweful... the aerial display was old and tired.  I have seen better on "America's Got Talent.". . Please, Please, Please don't waste your money or time.  Unless you own a time machine and can go back in time before you made the decision to buy the tickets.
WOW, I loved the show!   It was beautiful and the stage was amazing.   The stage can be acclimated to be perpendicular to the floor and the people who are performing are seriously risking their lives to perform.   I could watch this several times and I am not one who watches things a second time, once I've seen it.   I think it is one of the must sees in Vegas.   Some of these people's stunts are really dangerous and executed it flawlessly.   The whole thing is just wow,   I am excited to see other Cirque Du Soleil shows now.
I have seen many Cirque Du Soleil shows, all of which kept me on the edge of my seat and always blew my mind. That is, until I saw Ka. . . Several things made Ka inconsistent with the usual standards of Cirque Du Soleil. For one, the storyline was a total cliche. I think I have seen ABC Family do better. Seriously, similar storylines can be found in any daytime cartoon. Furthermore, the ending was unusually underwhelming. When the entire cast came out for the curtain call, the audience's collective reaction was something like "that was it?" Ka's short program time didn't help either. . . Then there was the entire fight scene that consisted only of a pre-recorded video of their actors comically "fighting". The video was overcompensated with a plethora of needlessly loud sword-clashing soundtrack. Actually, the video really felt like watching a cut scene from an old video game, like from Nintendo Street Fighters or something. The video was not only blurry, it was also yawn-inducing. It dragged on for a painful amount of time. If you have a small bladder, this is the perfect time to go for a bathroom trip since there is no intermission. The decision to play the video perplexed me thoroughly until I learned later that the original/live fight scene was removed from the show due to a death of an actor last year. . . Oh yeah, there was also an entire act that was just shadow puppets. Maybe I should have brought children to this show...? . . Overall, I still enjoyed the show despite its obvious shortcomings. (Having been drunk the whole time might have contributed to this.) Both the stage and the theater itself is impressive, and I loved it that I could feel the warmth of their pyrotechnics from my seat. Although, admittedly I sat only 4 rows from the front. As always, the energy and effort put forth by everyone involved with the production is inspiring.
I'm sorry but I have enjoyed EVERY single Cirque Du Soleil show..... except KA.. . I felt KA was too theatrical and less about performance. I have seen The O Show, Zumanity, Mystere, and KA.
This is my second Cirque Du Soleil show i've seen.  I had big expectations after first seeing O.  This was a good show don't get me wrong but I definately loved O.  I left KA liking it but not loving it.  The performers were awesome but that couple minutes of watching a projector/video game scene needs to go.  People pay a pretty penny and I understand that there was an accident with a previous show but I really feel they need to change that part of the performance.  We used the companion deal on MY VEGAS which was good but I would suggest seeing O over this.  Especially if it is your first Cirque Du Soleil show!
Let me begin by saying one word -- AMAZING. Seriously, if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? The amount of times I found myself getting chills and felt my mouth drop are endless. The cast did such a brilliant job, and the music was just beautiful. I would definitely say it is a MUST do when you visit Vegas!
The show was okay.  My seats were not as good as when I saw zurkana so I may be biased in that aspect.  There are some amazing scenes: fight on the boat and the vertical wall.  But there are a lot of slow scenes as well. The scenes that they tried to make funny we're not funny at all.  And the fighting all though was very good, got very repetitive.  Most people love this show.  I unfortunately am not one of them.
I would give this 5 stars if the vertical battle was live...but I knew going into this show that it would be a projection and bought the tickets anyway!. . This show is amazing!  The athleticism and production are nothing short of spectacular.  The performers' abilities to maneuver on the revolving stage is something to marvel at.  There is so much to take in at this show that a second viewing is probably in order.  The performance does occasionally extend out into the audience, such as the pre show and some of the battle scenes.  . . The story is very cohesive and easy to follow.  Every performer has their moment in the spotlight to showcase their athleticism.  Well, almost every performer.. . This leads into the epic vertical battle scene near the end that is now displayed as a projection against the vertical stage because a performer tragically fell to her death during a performance.  I applaud their attempt to ensure further safety to their performers but that battle scene is definitely missed.  The projection is blurry making it hard to distinguish the performers from each other, save for the imperial twins due to their green and red costumes.  . . YouTube KA live battle scene and you'll be able tosee what really happened during that battle scene.  For instance, SPOILER ALERT, I did not know that the forest creatures and the glittery dude were aiding the twins in battle!  I thought it was the Imperial guards versus the tattooed archers.  And the prince's body guard/companion was also lending them a hand here too!  I also knew the counselor's son was taken down by the twins in this battle but I couldn't make it out  clearly from the projection.  So because the LIVE battle was cut, you don't get to see the counselor's son display his athleticism in the show.  His other scenes include walking around with a huge bravado, laughing maniacally and making grand gestures with his arms.  Such a shame because the performer was so good in this role! Also, the firefly boy (glittery dude) and the creatures didn't get much time to do some cool aerial scenes.  Sure, they had some trapeze-ish moments in the forest when they make their first appearance, and while they were very beautiful and graceful, they were really tamed.. . The soundtrack is also incredible.  There was a blend of opera, rock, ballads and hyms.  I particularly love the music whenever the counselor's son was center stage, the rock opera number was so grand and powerful and portrayed his character so vividly.  Again, the performer did a phenomenal job in this role (and such a shame that he didn't get more live time due to the cut scene).  The other comedic twins, (chaperones maybe?) served as comedic relief and had some interesting scenes.  They also even got their moment on the VERTICAL stage.  . . So despite the blurry projection, this show is still worth seeing.  Prior to the show, I knew the epic battle would be modified, but I got to admit that when the projection came on, I was still a bit disappointed.  . . And finally, there is not one bad seat in the theater.  My party sat in section 201 (side seats), row GG, and we could still see everything!  The theater isn't massive and the revolving stage allows everyone in the audience a clear view.  . . Enjoy!
