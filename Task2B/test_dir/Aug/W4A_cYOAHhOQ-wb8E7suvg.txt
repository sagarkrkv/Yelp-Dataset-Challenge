Amazing show, wow!! The water adds a new dimension to all the special effects, been to cirque du soleil tons of times and this kept me on the edge of the seat the entire time!!
It was an amazing show. The only problem was that due to technical issues during the show; the fire part was omitted but I still enjoyed the show.
This is a truly amazing production in a city full of great shows. My husband and I are huge Cirque fans but I place this above those great shows (he doesnt). I like the faster pacing, the spectacular theatre and lighting and the simpler story.. . If I had another night in Vegas, I would go again. There are no bad seats but I would try for higher rows as you will be better able to ppreciate the aquatic artistry
An awe-inspiring display of skill and artistry by an army of incredibly talented athletes and performers... Exceptionally well done, and especially impressive if you haven't seen similar shows before.  I've seen Le Reve twice and enjoyed both times tremendously.  It is not an actual Cirque du Soleil production but worth every penny regardless.  If you're going to watch just one big show in Vegas, make it this one. . . I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 only because the theater seats could be more comfortable - there's very little leg room.  I understand the tight setup makes for a more intimate atmosphere but if you're on the taller side beware!   And yes avoid the splash zone front rows - you will get wet and it's not the ideal view anyway.   But overall thumbs up.
This is absolutely the best show I've ever seen! I took a special someone with me and we had very good seats. The water show is truly amazing and I loved every bit of the show. We didnt really get wet. Overall,  the Price I paid was worth every penny...I will definitely take my parents here to watch Le Reve....
This show was pretty amazing, a fast paced visual spectacular. The diving & acrobatics are phenomenal. I happened to like Ka better because there was more of a "story" that draws you in & the movement of the stage in Ka & the way the performers used the stage was unlike anything I have ever seen--breathtaking & fun. I kind of didn't "get" Le Reve. Not a compelling story with any kind of logical development. The first hour seemed like pretty much the same diving and acrobatics, just with different props & costumes & some magic tricks. The last 20-25 minutes was more varied & interesting--much more enjoyable to me. . . It's a must see in Vegas, but while I would see Ka again in a heartbeat, I wouldn't be excited to see Le Reve a second time. All seats are good seats in the theater. But I can't comment on the splash zone.
My boyfriend and I had the best time. We had the top seats and loved the show.  It's breath taking. We paid $180 and was well worth it. Their popcorn is delicious as well.
There are only three shows in Vegas I'll pay to see, and this is at the top of the list.  Every seat is great and the show is beyond anything Cirque could ever dream of being.
"Le Reve" as of now is the best show I have seen so far in Vegas.Just stunning, and amazing. Great music great performance, one of most enjoyable water theme show on the strip of Vegas. The hour and half show just flew by that's how much I really enjoy it. The venue set up was beautiful, so every sit in the house is actually a great sit. I would definitely watch again. Well worth it!!!
If you're looking for the best show in Las Vegas for the past 4 consecutive years running, then look no further. Le Reve is simply mind blowing. Although it is NOT a Cirque du Soleil show, it was designed by a Cirque director Franco Dragone (Cirque's Mystere and La Nouba). It's a show that you will want to see again and again. So, if you get a chance to see Le Reve while in Las Vegas, make sure you do not pass up the opportunity. Trust me, you won't regret seeing it!
I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.
