YUP! Ill be back and ill bring friends. . . If you have a group in town who love to eat and love their beer then this is the place for you. Its kind of dinner and a show, some contests, and a whole lot of other stuff going on... wood paddle to your butt yes please. I enjoyed the atmosphere with a few clients and had a great time here, as he was German and i know and miss the food from growing up. Its hearty, good portions and consistent. Its not the cheapest dinner in town but its certainly one of the most entertaining as there is always something to watch or look at while here. Band on stage cuttin it up to the beer stein holding strength contest that guests participate in. Being outgoing and entertaining is very much encouraged here so dont be shy, order a plate and a pint and make friends with the people sitting at your table. . . If your looking for a quiet meal out... this is not the place. But you can come here, leave VERY full, likely buzzed,and a few friends heavier on your way to the next destination after dinner... enjoy.
Nicest server ever. Best entertainer guy ever. Fantastic beer. Just,all around great times. One of my favorite things to do in Vegas. I've made it a tradition to always stop by here for lunch
My friend and I are staying at the hotel next door and before I even arrived she mentioned that she wanted to eat here while we were in town. Both of our families have German families so I was excited to see what sort of place it was. We were seated shortly before we were expected (we had a reservation for 8 PM) and were seated in the dining hall. It was incredibly loud! At the end you fill out a survey and it asked if the music was too loud and I had to say that the crowd was too loud. Maybe it was just the time of night. The music that I did hear was not German (lots of recognizable party songs) and the entertainment was amusing.. . My food was delicious! We split potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer) with salmon. I got the pork schnitzel and a side of spaetzle (my favorite holiday meal!). I wish that there had been a selecion of German wine but I did not see any on the menu. I spent more than I was expecting but it did taste good. I would take my family here and I think they'd enjoy it.. . With a drink, half an app, and the entree I got (from the special) I paid ~$50 before tip.
If you want to have fun while you eat this is the spot. I had tilapia, a bunch of cold cut type of food, some seriously delicious dogs. All of it was really delicious. For being an insanely busy place they were still so attentive and friendly. . It was a straight up party in there. The beer was great. Standing on tables singing, German band playing and some fun drinkinggames. To top that all off I think it's still a good place to take kids!
Service: Fairly standoffish and unfriendly waitress. Had to request a drink refill every time and every request we had seemed like an inconvenience for her. . . Food: Completely overpriced and subpar. Average of $20 a dinner plate. Drinks are completely overpriced as well. $15 for 1 liter of beer at a restaurant? No thanks.    . . Environment: As expected, this place is very loud. We were the furthest from the stage but still couldn't hear everyone at our table. . . Overall I would NOT recommend this place. The staff was very pretentious and cold. The food wasn't very good at any price and while the live entertainment was fun, the pretentious waitresses took away too much from the environment. . . I would not recommend this place under any circumstances.
Everyone liked their food, nice atmosphere. Tried to get a substitution of potatoes for spetzle, no dice. One we were done, we felt pressure to get out and make room for the next batch of tourists.
Wow, tough to give it four stars, but I am going to do that. I will explain why. Beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. Sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? You almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full Bavarian experience.. . So why 4 stars? The food. Let me tell you after spending five years in Germany and knowing what Bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. Really rich and authentic. I had the Cheese Plate appetizer which had American cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in Bavaria anyway. . . The Bratenteller is a mixture of Pork and beef with red cabbage and Spatzle. Authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc. . . Entertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder. . . You will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the Bavarian way and I met some of the most fantastic people including a family from Ireland. . . So money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. Just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you.
The schnitzel was a good average schnitzel. Probably some of the better schnitzel you will find in the US. The potato salad was different than the potato salad from Germany, but still good. The burger was a very good quality, tasty and moist. I would highly recommend the burger. It is not what you would normally expect. The Black Forest cake is very good and moist. The sauce is to die for. The Hofbrau beer is a true German beer that is not common to most restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone to visit. It is a good, close to authentic German meal.
Decent-enough German food, gigantic beer steins, live traditional music, and public humiliation. They seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.. . Considering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.. $60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.. . Kartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15. . Special Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20. . The beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16. . The reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.. Our waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed "you good?" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.. There was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. Disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.
This wasn't my first time to Hofbrauhaus, but it was my first time to this location.  Just a short taxi trip off the strip, Hofbrau is a beer drinkers delight.  German beerhall fashion tables, live music a liter beers.  What more could you possibly want?  There's more. . . During our hour or so long visit, (plus a short wait), many, many people were spanked, yes spanked, by the more than willing females servers.  We did not partake, but it was fun to watch. . . In addition, the cheerful dancing on benches, live music, and stein holding contests were all exciting, fun happenings to keep us entertained.  We went for the pretzels and sausages and the food was quite good as well. . . Prost!
The beer hall style of dining was unique. The host seated us with another party of four which really livened up the atmosphere with cheerful laughter and conversation. The service was great and the food was authentic to my expectations. They serve there beers in large glass boots which were fun to drink out of. They also had a gentlemen on stage playing a instrument and singing while a lady would paddle patrons at their seats. You have to love octoberfest!
