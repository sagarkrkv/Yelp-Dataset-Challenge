I'm definitely a fan of Gordon Ramsey- I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious! But their fries and onion rings may need a revisit from Gordon Ramsey :( but overall it's a great experience.
Our first time here.was sketchy at first. Went on a Thursday evening. Hardly any wait time. Husband and I both ordered a burger, however we shared fries which was good because the portion was huge. The burgers were cooked exactly how we wanted it. They weren't pushy on up selling drinks and food which I liked. They don't have you put your name down for waiting, you stand in line which not sure I liked. It was a good atmosphere. Burgers are around 14-17 a piece which does not include fries. I would recommend this place to friends....
Cool restaurant in a great part of the strip.  The fire on the outside wall just sucked us right in.  Noisy, busy, crowded and didn't think much of the high-top dining.  Our server was wonderful, the burger was ok, the shake was really good, but the price, oh the price..  That was the most memorable part.  Let's just say that even for a cool new place on the strip I found the price to be a bit much for what we got.  As a local, would i go back?  Yes - as long as I wasn't picking up the bill.
Delicious!! We watch Gordon Ramsay's shows and were excited to try his food. The shake my husband had was incredible, an Oreo shake topped with creme brulee pudding! We went around 12 on a weekday and had a very short wait. Great service, food came quickly. I recommend the shake #4, roasted jalapeno poppers, southern yardbird burger, and Hell's Kitchen burger. I didn't love the fries but everything else exceeded my expectations!
You have not tasted an amazing burger until you have tried Gordon Ramsey. Absolutely nobody should compare this restaurant to bachi, because it is beyond amazing.. . My friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and only waited for about 5-10 minutes, which was fine because it gave us time to peruse the menu and check out yelp for some tips.. . I decided to try the brittania. The mango chutney made me a little hesitant, but I decided to just go for it and I'm glad I did. The mango, arugula, and sharp cheddar worked in a beautiful medley with the beef. It has this amazing sweet and savory was amazing.. . My friend go the euro burger. She really loved it. I tried some of it, but it made me realize that I really don't like goat cheese. . . The truffle fries were pretty great. It was actually really big. I shared with my friend and we couldn't finish it with our burgers. The sauce it came with was amazing. The truffle aioli was something else. Y'all need to hit it up!. . I forsure can't wait to come here again and try the hog burger, if I'm not really tempted by the Brittania again. It was that good.
Very good burger. The milkshake was freaking amazing! Ramsay made a nice place. Staff is very professional and the atmosphere is trendy. Price is around $10 per burger and if you have a slot membership card you can get a buck off which is worth while to get since it is free and you can use it other places.
Don't queue or book on the phone, just give your name to the hostess at the front. They will text you when your table is ready!. Food is great, meat delicious and well cocked. . Service is great, tvs switched on sport (love it). . The burgers were delicious but a bit small, but so good. You need to go there !!!
I may be biased because I'm obsessed with Gordon. I have loved all of his Vegas restaurants!
I would like to call myself a burger connoisseur since I can eat burgers every day of my life.  With that being said, this place has some awesome gourmet burgers!  Located in the Planet Hollywood Casino Resort, it is pretty loud.  The burgers come a la carte and aren't terribly huge like other burger restaurants.  But don't be fooled by the size.  Everything is perfect and the meat is ridiculous! I can't describe how tender and scrumptious the burger patty was.  You can order fries and onion rings separately.  They also have a wide array of beers and they bring you an iPad to look over their drink menu.  After your meal you can walk around all the different stores in the casino which is like a little mall.
Farm burger w/ the duck bacon and fried egg was really good. Got the #2 shake which was also pretty decent. Not a big fan of the fries, the chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup were kind of gross, really wanted something more "normal" tasting.. . Service was great, waitress checked up on us frequently, had a party of 6 people so the wait took 30-45min but we were able to expand it to fit another 2 friends when they dropped in.
Wow. You know, I like watching some of the shows with Gordon in them and so I thought that this would be a great experience. I actually planned ahead to eat here because I knew the wait would be long. Checked in with the hostess and went and checked out some stores in the indoor mall. . The hostess was very nice and the server was very nice, and made a couple of suggestions. . I had read many reviews before coming here and so of course my expectations were high. I had the farm burger, and my wife had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We usually order different things so that we could try each other's. We had a couple different types of fries. My two sons both had adult size burgers as well and I tried both of theirs. Well, it wasn't even slightly impressive. Boring, bland, and a whole lot of so what. . Regardless of having high expectations this place was just not very good. . Again, the service was great, the atmosphere fun, the food was not even close to just about any burger place I have ever been to. I'm not mad...just disappointed and surprised.
The Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a well thought out plan. A nice resturant located inside of a casino. The initial waiting time was about and hour and a half, which to our standards was a pretty long time. When we got to the front of the line, we were very excited, and even more so when we were seated. The servers were very nice, and the staff was full. We ordered burgers, obviously, I ordered mine medium well. When the food came, my burger was well done, maybe even a little charred. I was starving, but I didn't really care. The burger itself was delicious, and as usual, I like to put ketchup on it. The ketchup they provided was a odd concoction of chipotle, vinegar, and regular ketchup, watered down. I have many allergies, and after I ate the burger, I felt like I was allergic to the burger some how. . . Ambiance- Beautiful . Staff- Awesome . Waiting Time- Horrible. Food- Moderate. Thank you.
Let me ,just say, I am a true sucker for a great burger & mac n' cheese! . . I watch way too many Gordon Ramsey show, so expectations of his restaurant is pretty high.  We waited for about 30mins for seats.  When we actually got seated, the server was truly just amazing.  He was super informative about the entire menu, gave some recommendations and just continued to make sure that we enjoyed our experience there, and we did! . . Burgers: . Hell's Kitchen Burger $13 (shoot!  I had to order this medium well because I was sharing w/a friend   I wish the jalapeno peppers had a little more of a kick to it.  But overall, this is the best burger I have ever had). asadero cheese + roasted jalapeno peppers + avocado. + oven roasted tomato.  . Greens & Salad:. Kale Granny-Apple Caesar Salad $11 (nothing special, just a good Caesar salad) . parmigiano-reggiano cheese. + mini herb-garlic croutons. . Fries: . Truffle Parmesan Fries $10 (nothing special, but the fries should not be wedges.  Didn't quite taste the truffles in here). hand cut fries + truffle parmesan. + truffle salt + truffle aioli. . Of course, I will come back here if I was in Vegas.  My rating was really based on the Burger, environment and service which was a great experience.
The burgers are awsome the hells kitchen burger was great my wife had the chanterelle  mushroom burger it was incredible  my daughter  hot dog was like 15 inches long great atmosphere service great
"Another burger place to love inspired by yet another one of my favorite chefs!" I recommend the Hells Kitchen Burger, "Delicious!" You have to try the truffle fries as well! This restaurant is perfect for when you want to that fancy meets casual feel with out having to dress up. :-)
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I'm from L.A. and I gotta say I've tried alot of really great burgers, but I think the farm burger from here is my favorite!!! Also, shake #4 which is an oreo shake is by far the best shake I've had! BurGR has become a necessary stop every time I go to Vegas. I was just in Vegas this past weekend and stopped at BurGR yesterday and it was even better than I remembered. The jalapeno poppers, farm burger, and oreo shake were all delicious AND the prices are extremely reasonable, especially for Vegas. Our server was awesome and very attentive. The wait was an hour and a half, but I have to say it was definitely worth it. My friends and I just played roulette in the Planet Hollywood Casino while we waited to be conveniently texted once our table was ready. THIS IS A MUST WHEN IN VEGAS!!!!!!!
Gordon Ramsay has 3 restaurants in Vegas and during my trip to Sin City, I was eager to try one of them. Definitely glad it was this one because GR sure knows what he's doing when it comes to burgers!!! . . My party of 5 came here on Friday for brunch. There wasn't a wait yet at 11AM but after we finished our meal, we saw a ~30-minute queue to be seated. While I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't mind doing so for these bougie burgers. . . After browsing the menu, I settled on the Farm Burger w/ duck breast bacon & a fried egg. It seemed to be a popular option and the waiter even confirmed that it was his personal favorite so I didn't have any "buyer's remorse" about my choice. . . The burger itself was very rich and juicy. The hero of the meal was the runny egg, which was a really nice touch. I enjoyed my burger...however, my bf's Hog Burger was a burger of impossibly EPIC proportions!!! After first bite, I was sold. It was flavorful, savory, had that magical X-factor, and I definitely see why it got a special spot on the menu apart from the other selections. If it sounds like I have the biggest school girl crush on it, it's because I do. . . Aside from our main course, we also ordered a portion of truffle fries to share. The fries were a hit! Our waiter suggested we order 2 for 5 people and when the fries came out in a cone, I questioned our decision of ordering just 1... The portion size looked dinky for $10. However, it ended up being just right because we were all full from our burgers. . . Service here was also spectacular, which was not surprising because GR is known for running a tight ship. Ambiance is also relaxed so you don't need to be dressed to the nines. . . Overall.... I had a GRand time GRubbing here. You might even say it was the best burGR I've ever had ;).
The food was, without a doubt, cooked to perfection - as expected from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Our table of 5 ordered 4 burgers, sides of fries, and a caesar salad.  The wait for the food was a bit long as the restaurant was packed.  However, our waitress, Hilary, made up for it by being extremely helpful and professional in making sure our first experience at Burgr would have a lasting impact.  I would highly recommend this joint to anyone craving for burgers, and if possible, request to have Hilary serve you.
Hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten.  I had the HK burger and my wife had the Brittania, and both of them were flat-out phenomenal.  "It's cooked beautifully" (in my best GR voice.  The servers are very attentive, the pricing isn't bad ($15 for this burger wasn't out of line, IMHO), and everything about the restaurant smacks of attention to detail.  . . Try the sweet potato fries.  Absolutely delicious.  . . This place is worth the wait.  You could also wait until after midnight, usually there's no line by then.
Food and service were great. Wife got the fish sandwich, and I got the Britannia Burger. They were both delicious.
By far the juiciest most flavorful burger I have ever had, better than my previous favorites BLT burgers and Holstien's Burger and Bun, which are fine burgers in their own right! Farm Burger is outstanding, Hell's Kitchen Burger also first rate! You can tell it's great food when it just gets better bite after bite! Great service we were pampered!
Euro burger is awesome and worth getting. Maui Onion rings are really good and worth getting. Farm burger is okay. With the egg and bacon it is a nice breakfast type burger but not the flavor we expected for dinner. Truffle Parmesan Fries are good but we did not care much for the truffle aioli. It was much better with the curry ketchup
Oh my! I've never considered myself much of a burger person, until now. This burger was perfection! A simple cheese with lettuce and it was spectacular. As were the fries and the environment. . . The only reason four the four star review is that our service was about as bad as it gets. Our server was really out of it. Tables with other servers sat after us and ordered before us. Others sat after us, ordered after us, and finished their meals before we were served. The issue appeared to be limited to our area/server. . . All of that said I would go back. No question. The standard of the food is on another level.
This place has received a lot of good reviews so maybe my experience was just a fluke. I came here for dinner on a Friday night to get a quick fuel up before an evening of Las Vegas festivities. There was a bit of a wait which is totally understandable on a Friday night. We were actually seated really quickly. The ambiance of this restaurant is really nice and it is very well decorated. Our waiter was prompt and attentive throughout our entire meal. The selection of craft beers was very good.. . I ordered jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and the uber cheese burger for dinner. The poppers were good. The outside was wellfried and crisp. The dipping sauce they were served with was an excellent compliment. . . Unfortunately my meal went downhill after our appetizer. I ordered the uber cheese burger and when it came out it was clear it had been left to sit under a heat lamp or just on the counter as it was warm but certainly not hot or fresh off the grill. Additionally, the cheese on top of the burger was not even melted. I also ordered two different sides of fries the sweet potato fries and regular fries. Again, both were just warm certainly not freshly prepared. The dipping sauces for both were very good though.. . I have certainly had a better burger and eaten at better restaurants in Las Vegas for the same price. I will certainly not be coming back. I was very disappointed and I expected better out of this restaurant.
We're HK/Ramsay fans and have been itching to go to BurGR. We read about the crazy wait times but we went at a good point in the day and only had to entertain ourselves for about 30-40 minutes (in Vegas that isn't hard to do, c'mon people).. . I thought I wasn't going to eat much since I had just finished a late breakfast, but 3 glasses of their iced tea later I was starving, not to mention fangirling as Chef Christina, winner of Season 10 was there. I was bouncing around in my seat like an idiot. . . Anyway, I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger because I love peppers and avocado. Swallowed that sucker whole. The table ordered both parmesan-truffle and regular fries and they were delicious. We caught a glimpse of the behemoth that was their hot dog. Thing was HUGE.. . I bought a glass from the bar and my bf broke it three days later after it survived the trek home. Heartbroken, but it gives me an excuse to go back.
My second time here. We now have a different waiter who wouldn't let us split our shake even though there's pictures on here saying other customers can do that. I originally gave five stars but I can already tell I won't be enjoying this experience the way I did the first time. . . First experience the hostess said they would text or call you after waiting in line but didn't. I had to ask twice to get seated. But!!! Our waiter was extremely helpful and food was perfect!!! . . What a complete 360...
The food, service, and atmosphere were great and the prices were very reasonable for a restaurant right on the strip. It was not very original or mind blowingly awesome. I had the onion rings for an appetizer. They were sprinkled with Parmesan and came with ranch and spicy ketchup. Very tasty. For a main course I had the American burger. It had a sesame seed bun, red onions, butter lettuce, pickle, and cheddar cheese on a medium-well cooked patty.  Also very tasty. Over all it was really good, just not amazing.
I'm glad I came here an hour before closing time, that way I didn't have to wait in an hour line just to eat! **ALSO, if you're signed up with Total Rewards, you can shave a few dollars off your bill, free to sign up.***. . Went up to the hostess and she told us to wait in line while they got our table ready which took 5 minutes. The only awesome decor that I see that they had set up were the flames 0.0 how I wish I wasable to sit next to it. The place was a full house, busy and loud of course. I didn't realize that the menu was already placed at the table and was used as decor for the silverware. Nifty :-). The waitress took a while to greet us and didn't come fill our drinks once... . . Couldn't decide on what to order just yet so we started with the parmesan fries which my sister and I were extremely disappointed in. They come out as steak fries which is not terrible, but when they come out soggy it's not enjoyable. The dipping sauces were delicious but it wasn't enough to make up for soggy fries. . . Next up was the Hell's Kitchen Burger. We took this to go since we got tired of waiting for slow service and figured it'd be a better experience to bring it to our room to enjoy. Especially having some water to drink! . We went upstairs, turned on the TV. Much more relaxing.... They cut our burger into two cooked at medium rare... Nice and juicy the way I like it. First bite into it... O my... I was surprised how great it was. The ingredients all came together to have this tangy jalapeno beef burger. I wished I was filled up on fries so I would feel like a chubster wanting to eat the other half. Sadly it went to the sister.. I will definitely come back and try a few other things on the menu.
Great service I ordered the parmergon fries and the hells kitchen burger and the banana milkshake the butterscotch pudding was divine it was excellent definitely will go there again
Gave it a second chance...over priced burgers lacking in debth, flavor and taste.  Good service, but you can pass on this mediocre burger bar, nothing special, except for the fire decor outside the restaurant.  Fish burger was greasy, no flavor and lacked total flavor, fries ok, how can you mess up fried potatoes. Other's ordered various mediocre burgers - meh..they said In and Out is better - wow...had the portobello burger last time, ok..nothing special...keep walking by...Do better Gordon, this place needs an overhaul or restaurant makeover by Robert Irvine!
Friday afternoon, took about 15-20 to get in which is fine.  Party of 2.  . . Once I was seated, I placed my drink and food order with the waitress in a timely order.  . . After that, she never came back.  We received the food from a different worker, never once was asked if the food was good or if we needed anything else.   . . The burgers were good no complaints.  1/3 of the fries were undercooked so you couldn't eat all of them.  . . In the end we had to ask a random worker for the check because we had been finished and waiting for 10-15 minutes with no service.   He actually went to tell the server we needed the bill and she didn't even bring it to us.  Someone else did.  Pretty lame.  . . . Burger was good. Fries 50/50. Service whack.
Stood and waited for 30 mins for a table. What was really disheartening was the amount of empty tables we could see through the the pointless but clearly expensive glass sign. . . While Gordon may be a renowned chef world wide, it's doesn't excuse the ridiculous get up that is presented here. Empty tables = no one paying: why the hel make people queue needlessly when there are perfectly good tables available. . . Sadly we didn't wait to sample the food but there is no excuse for this crap! Can I say btw we counted 32 empty seats alone. This was in the back as we walked by!!!!
I have been here twice! The Farm Burgr is amazing. The egg and the burgr are cooked to perfection! It is just delicious. Also, their service is fast and friendly.
Prior to our trip, we were looking for places to eat while in Vegas and this happened to be one of them. This place is inside Planet Hollywood. We tried to get there when they opened to beat the long line. We later found out that the line outside was for parties of 2. If you're in a larger group, you should ask to have your name put down. The wait for us was about 45 minutes, and when our table was ready they texted us. . . The place itself was really nice. I ordered the farm burger and it was filling since the meat is pretty thick but it didn't wow me. I didn't really taste the egg that was in the burger. It was definitely a good experience though, but I'm not sure if I would come back for a $15 burger. . . What I found pretty cool was that at the end of your meal when they give you your check, they also hand you a iPod touch...which they have their satisfactory survey on.
The wait was long. I didn't care for my burger I ordered the Euro. The other two burgers Hells kitchen and American were good. Beer was excellent. It's cool but kinda pricey.
In n out beats this place hands down. I don't understand what is so special abt hells kitchen burger and the chicken burger had bones in the patty. Truffle fries were good. I don't understand what's the hype abt this place. Never going back.
Just finished eating here with our group of seven.  Well worth the hour wait.  I highly recommend you be the carrier of a Rewards Card as this may help group sizes in obtaining a table sooner rather than later.  Ryan, our server, was professional, courteous, and had a splendid sense of humor.   Parties of two generally are seated more quickly than groups (3+ people) so be aware of that before showing up here on a busy Friday/Saturday night.. . Blue burger... Farm burger... we had other types as well.  They were excellent.  The truffle fries were scrumptious and we recommend asking your server for the plate of dipping sauces (blue cheese, ketchup, ranch, et cetera). . Remember Ryan... Gordon's burgers ARE better than Carl's Jr. burgers!  ;)
We decided to try this for lunch on a Wednesday and only had about a 30 min wait which was nice considering how long the line was.  It was definitely worth the wait.. . I am 99.9% sure this was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I ordered the Britannia burger and it was the most amazing, flavorful and juicy burger ever.  I ordered fries which were nicely done - crispy but not overdone.  We shared the Jalapeno poppers - six on a plate, each in their own individual ramekin with sauce.  One is supposed to still have seeds - ours had two and I happen to pull both of them!   . . I highly recommend for a great, reasonably priced burger on the Strip.  . . Looking forward to my next visit!
Great place! There is always a line to wait in, but if only 2 people in your party it goes very fast...20 minutes tops. If more than 2 then be prepared for 45 minutes to hour wait. We sit at the bar and had outstanding service. Was quick and attentive and outfits waiter and waitresses wear are HOT! Ordered the jalapeno poppers and was definitely impressed. 6 in and order and each is in an individual shot glass. Popper is cooked well and nice sauce served with them. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was great, but shared with husband and one half of it was so hot it was impossible to eat - spicy hot. Other half was terrific so I don't know if just had very hot pepper or what. Fries are great and you get two styles of ketchup with order. Loved the chipotle one...the curry was different but enjoyable. Very nice place!
Visited for lunch on Saturday 8/9/14. . Delicious! . . The server was super friendly, nice guy from Santa Cruz (forgot his name). . . We got 4 appetizers because they all sounded amazing! They were!! Chicken wings, poppers, bao, onion rings...I would eat them all right now again!. . And the burgers, oh the burgers between us we got the two chicken burgers,  the spicy burger, and and I forgot the last one.. . They were all amazing!. . Great food, great service, great time!. . Only one complaint,  there's a line out front DO NOT GET IN LINE! Check in at the host stand...stood in line for 15 minutes for nothing...they should get rid of that line.
Party of two, so we were seated quickly. Got the Britannia burger and Parmesan fries. Not enough mango chutney on the burger, couldn't taste it. The meat was quality and cooked perfectly. Bun was awesome. Fries were disappointing because they were soggy/wet. My co-worker got the sweet potato fries... Much better than mine. Service was very good. Burger, fries, diet coke and tip = $37, ouch.
This place deserves every ounce of hype it gets. Talk about redefining the burger. If you wish to confirm why this place always has lines that rival those of the best nightclub at Cosmopolitan, pay a visit after midnight, when the hordes are getting wasted elsewhere. You will find that even the humble AMERICAN BURGER here is vastly superior to anything you have tasted at the mainstream burger joints. My personal favorite is the HELL KITCHEN'S BURGER, but I warn you about its spiciness. It's hot. It's sexy. Your first bite of it will result in an orgasmic burst of traditional Mexican flavors fused with all the protein greatness of well-prepared American meat. Skip the sweet potato fries. Their water tastes like wonderful chlorine, so splurge on beer or if you are desperate, soda. On the weekends, get a booth and avoid the bar at all costs. The gal there is super nice, but the guy bartenders are as pleasant as an emphysemic smoker's overly ripe phloem!
Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.. . Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. . . So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. . . The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. . . The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.. . We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. . . Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. . . Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me.
Exceptional burger place, for a reasonable price, considering you're at a celebrity restaurant on the strip. The wait is long, but worth it.. The burger combinations are delicious, my favorite is the one with the fig spread. They are usually perfectly cooked.. The thing that sets this place apart is the truffle fries and the desserts. The truffle fries are a concoction of beautifully presented fries with a generous sprinkling of light Parmesan fluffs (for lack of a better word) mixed with freshly chopped herbs, and truffle, of course! Love it! I could probably have an order to myself althoughit's big enough (and expensive enough) to share.. The dessert combinations are also stellar, with delicious milkshakes topped with a wonderful pudding. It sounds weird, but imagine a milkshake topped with a somewhat chocolate mousse-flavored topping. Awesome!!. The only flaw we've ever found is once the dip for the fries had a skin on it from being prepared ahead of time. The dishes are starting to looking a bit beaten-up, but considering the high volume of people, understandable. They should swap it out, though, and the placemats are looking a bit raggedy for the image.. Not as much kid-friendly as Holstein's, no kids menu. I think Holsteins' burgers on a good day can beat BurGR when they aren't on top of their game. They can't touch BurGR's truffle fries or milkshakes, though!
Very long wait for us (we were told 20-25 mins, it was more like 45-50 mins).. Excellent service, ambience and food. The staff member was courteous, well-informed about the menu and gave us great suggestions.. An experience to remember (despite the wait)! . We got the fish and chips sandwich (large portion, very tasty) and the Euro burger which was also very good!
A little pricey but what do you expect--you're on the Strip.. . The food and service were excellent. If you find yourself there and not craving a burger, you'd do fine with the Soba Chicken Salad.
Despite waiting for over 20 mins. The food was delicious!! I am a hugr fan of gordon ramsay, and it now i finally know how awesome his food is! I wanted to try the gordon ramsay steak house but it was on the higher end side. So i guess ill wait until next time!!. . We ordered the farm burger and chicken burger with truffled fries.. . The burgers were amazeballsss. It was the juiciest burgers i have ever eaten. The truffled fries are to die for!! The cream dip it comes with is bombbb!. . A photographer took a few pictures of us.. But we never found out where or how we could obtain them?? Wouldve liked to know what happened to them.. . Anyway, love this place!! Not too fancy but it definitely hits the spot!
Does Burgr live up to the high expectations we've set for Gordon Ramsay? That would be a resounding YES!  My wife and I went to Burgr twice during our two night stay in Las Vegas, and loved it! Please try the Farm Burger and the Hells kitchen burger. The ingredients were fresh, sinful, and left my brain wanting more in spite of my full belly. I will be back.
Amazing.. . Magical cows.  Yes, magical cows grazing on magical grass. On a magical farm.  Cows who willingly provide magical milk for the shakes and give their lives to create the greatest hamburgers ever made.  It's the only explanation I can come up with.. . I'm not a big fan of the Gordon Ramsay 'Hell's Kitchen' show like many who frequent BurGR are.  I've seen maybe two episodes at best.  So when people started pointing at the executive chef, I had to Google her from the name embroidered on her chef's uniform.  Turns out she won Season Ten.  I didn't care, but that's kind of interesting.  But not as interesting as my meal.. . I normally wouldn't wait in line 30 minutes for a meal at a burger joint, but I was dining alone and there was a very short wait to eat at the counter. I'd heard good things so it seemed an ideal opportunity to try it out.  Next time I'm in town, I'll happily wait 30 minutes, an hour or however long it takes because it's well worth the wait. . . The menu includes some selection of appetizers (onion rings looked amazing) and a selection of about ten burgers.  They had salads and some other stuff, but really why bother?  There is a fancy hot dog that seemed popular, but I was focused on getting one of these famous burgers I have heard about.. . Burgers ranged from the good old American Burger (my choice, a plain cheeseburger the way those magical cows probably intended) to other interesting combinations. One of the specialty burgers involved duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  It's that kind of place.  My burger and the bun were terrific.  It's not cheap ($13 for burger alone) but worth it.  Burgers are  cooked over an apple wood fire or something, which I guess actually makes a difference?  Or it's just the magical cows again. . . Fries include sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and 'just fries' - had the regular fries and the chipotle and curry ketchups were available as well.  Amazing.  Add $9.. . Finally, the milkshakes - ranging from creme brulee (my runner up - next time) to coconut to caramel pudding and more.  I chose 'Shake #3' which included a banana milkshake covered in butterscotch pudding and topped with a snickerdoodle cookie.  It was SOOOOOO good it has at the very least tied the Twinkie shake at BLT Burger for best shake ever.  I may need to conduct a side-by-side taste test next time I'm in town.  Add another $9.  Yes, $9 for a shake.  Worth every penny.. . The ambiance is great and, if you are into the whole 'celebrity chef' thing, you'll love it even more.  Service was prompt and super-friendly, and the food, as I said, is wonderful.  It's the magical cows.  . . The whole meal, just a burger, fries and milkshake, came to about $40 with tip.  Yes, $40 for a basic burger and fries.  Again repeat after me. . . . worth. every. penny.. . Kudos, Gordon Ramsay.  I didn't think I'd every pay that kind of money for a burger.  But I did, and I will again.  When you visit your magical farm please tell the cows I thank them for their service!
Excellent Burger, great fries, good atmosphere!. . Of most 5 star gourmet burger joints, this place does not disappoint. Burger cooked to perfection, chargrilled and juicy. I choose the Hells Kitchen Burger with mild asadero cheese melting into roasted jalapenos and oven-roasted tomatoes with cool avocado balancing out the bunch. Price was right at $15 dollars a person. Stop, drop and indulge!!
My burger was salty and chared - I ordered medium. My soda was flat and they had no means of replacing it with something that wasn't. . . The service was mediocre and it was very loud.
I've only had a to-go order here, therefore, my review is mainly for the food itself and not for the service or ambiance of the restaurant. . . Came here a couple weeks ago because my family was in town and they love Gordon Ramsay. We ordered a couple Hell's Kitchen and Farm burgers. . . The good:. 1. Girls at the front were very friendly and helpful. I read a couple reviews that said they were rude, but we did come at a time when they're not busy at all, so I think that helps. My parents, being the Asian tourists they are, took pics all over the restaurant and they weren't hassled.. 2. Burgers are great, perfectly seasoned. . 3. Menu is cute.. . The bad, or I guess the so-so:. 1. Girl who helped me order said that they grill the burger pretty rare here and told me to order Medium Well when I said I like my burger pink in the middle. I've ordered a burger Medium at the Counter and it came out pretty much still bloody red in the middle, so I thought BurGR is the same way. I ordered mine Medium....there was hardly any pink in the center. It looks like a Medium Well on its way to become Well Done really soon. It was overcooked. The burger still tastes great but I was disappointed they didn't cook it to my liking. . 2. Price. Obviously I do understand I'm paying extra because first, it's inside a Planet Hollywood on the Strip, and second, it's Gordon frickin' Ramsay. But the burger was pretty small for $15 and it doesn't come with fries (most gourmet burger places don't include it). Fries are another $7 - $10 so you'll be spending $22 - $25 for burger and fries. Maybe I could justify the price if I were sitting down, enjoying the atmosphere or watching sports. But I wasn't.. . I want to come back to dine in, and also try the jalapeno poppers which look amazing. If you do get a to-go order, check and make sure they cook the burger right before you leave.. . Tip: use your Total Rewards card! $1 cheaper for almost every item.
So normally I would not be so picky with a review, however I am obsessed with burgers - eating the best anywhere has to offer and also making them at home. It takes a lot to impress me. WhenI eat a gourmet burger  I have high expectations.. . We tried the truffle fries, blue cheese burger and the jalapeno burger we split the burgers in half so we could share( I don't recall the exact names but these were the main toppings). The blue cheese burger was very nice, lots of blue cheese but I though the bun was disappointing. At $15  a burger I expect a much higher quality type of bread. Overall a delicious burger. The Jalapeno one, I was expecting a little spice - not at all spicy, not even an after kick, I didn't even finish it as it was just totally lacking in flavor.. . Lastly we ordered the burgers medium well and they came out pink in the middle  and the service was not particularly fast - tons of servers , not that many diners but the kitchen was slow when we went. Everyone was really nice though and they were open late which we appreciated.. . The TRUFFLE FRIES - AMAZEBALLS. . . So overall, yes yummy food, but for someone who really considers themselves  a foodie with a burger obsession I felt that while food was good it was overall nothing to really brag about. Go check it out for yourself and order the truffle fries. I personally feel that Umami Burger is much better than this place.
Well spank my ass and call me Sally! We had to wait over an hour in line(HUNGOVER) to get a table, but it was worth it. I don't know if it was my hangover aching for greasy, delicious food, but I had over a year to sit on this review and this place serves some delicious ass meat cakes.
Love it! A bit of a wait, but worth it. The food is great, shakes are great, try the sweet potato fires.... awesome!
Ever since my bf successfully turned me into a Gordon Ramsay fan, both of us have been trying to eat at his restaurants whenever we can. So on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this restaurant. We did not have to wait in line for that long (it was early lunch on Sunday).  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger (So juicy~~TWO THUMBS WAY UP), he had the Farm Burger (he did not like this one very much),and shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries (SO GOOD). . . If you ever read this...we love you, Gordon Ramsay!!!
Came here with my awesome group of friends and didn't even wait that long for 13 people. The atmosphere here is amazing, the food taste awesome and great service. . . The menu is not that selective. My friend got the Hell's Kitchen burger and I got the farm burger. I got to admit the spicy kick in the Hell's Kitchen burger is what made it taste amazing. My farm burger (duck and bacon) was good too. The fries here were outstanding.. . 1. Hell's Kitchen burger comes with jalapenos and Avocado. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The spicy kick made it pop!. . 2. The fsrm burger is full of flavor, you can taste the bacon and the duck. It's not to fatty nor grease and definitely hits the spot.. . 3. We got the jalapeno shooters, this was fun because there is one jalapeno stuffed with the spicy seeds. My friends all took and waited to see who was the special person. In the end, it was not me!. . I would definitely go back.
Okay.. so no 4 stars because... I hated the burger bun. it's hard, it's not tasty, it's not special and it's dry.  Also, the fries, although TASTY..were EXTREMELY salty. . . Highlights:. sweet potato fries and that sweet jalapeno sauce.. dude. heaven. HEAVEN.. milkshakes. any milkshakes. don't be afraid of that delish pudding they put on top of there either. I'm lactose intolerant and I thought I'd be okay but they must you quality ingredients in there because my stomach hurt so bad that night...but it was worth it.. my actual burger was pretty good, i forgot what I got but it's the egg. Let me rephrase this.. the ingredients and the INSIDE was good, I was just underwhelmed with the quality of the bun. I tried some of the other burgers my friends got and they were good too- but once again.. turned off by the bread they had. My burger was cooked a little more than what I requested- medium rare, but I did that on purpose because I knew if I ordered a medium, it would end up medium well. I think chefs are afraid of cooking meat medium rare especially on the west coast bc we can't handle rare meat like people in europe and the east coast does. . . I'd still come here for those damn sweet tater fries and milkshakes. . Don't let the line fool you- it looks long but it goes relatively quick.
Food was ok, service was good.  Not impressed after being so excited to come!   It's very loud, good for groups of people but the food was nothing special.  Glad we came but won't be back.
Allora: hamburger divino, patate fritte (quelle grosse) normali, niente di eccezionale, servizio freddino ma cortese e sorridente, manca solo il bacon negli hamburger. Refill come al solito, la cosa che piu amo dei locali americani. Gordon, promosso!
I've had the pleasure of dining here 3 times and seriously love everything. My girlfriends and I constantly reminisce about the food, particularly the jalapeno poppers and the euro burger. For an Englishman, Gordon knows his way around a burger. . . I've found that there is always a bit of a wait, so be prepared! I always try to come right before the lunch or dinner rush to avoid an even longer wait. The restaurant is very open and you can see right into the kitchen. They do have a bar out front, but it is very exposed. It's a bit on the pricey side, but come on people it's Gordon Ramsay!. . My favorite snacks to start are the onion rings and jalapeno poppers. The onion rings are lightly battered, crispy, and served with two delicious sauces. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but the jalapeno poppers have the best flavor! They are cheesy and rich and served in adorable little shot glasses. So good!. . I've tried a few of the burgers and my favorite by far is the Euro burger. The goat cheese is incredibly flavorful and rich. The burger is always cooked to perfection and the buns aren't too heavy. I'm also a big fan of the fish and chips sandwich. It's a little awkward to eat, you're probably going to need a knife and fork, but the fish is absolutely perfect. If you need a side for your burger go with the truffle fries. I seriously wanted to bathe in the truffle aioli, I mean I almost licked the little cup. So at this point you are absolutely stuffed, but make room for a milkshake because you haven't had one like this before and you can't leave without one! I've only had milkshake #4 and it was a spiritual experience, I seriously wanted a private room to indulge! The Oreo shake is rich and delicious, but the creme brulee pudding sets it off. Yes, I said creme brulee pudding! Go, go get one, NOW! . . In my opinion the food is more than worth the price and you deserve to indulge once in awhile :)
I always walk pass this restaurant when I was in Vegas a few months ago. I thought since it's Gordon Ramsey, it should be great. I was here a few days ago with my friend. She had a soba noodle chicken salad. She said it was really good. As for me, I got the farm burger. It was. ehhh. ok? It wasn't the best burger I had. The meat was really dry. My friend and I also got truffle fries which is big enough to share.. The truffle fries were delicious.
I just wanted to add a review on a different burger I tried here called the Britannia. It definitely trumped over the other burgers I had the last time I came here. OMgosh that mango chutney yo! I didn't know what mango chutney was at first, but it appeared to be a spread/condiment with a spice and mango blend. It's the perfect topping to compliment the the flavors in this burger. If you like sweet and savory, then I highly recommend this burger.. . Similar to my last visit here, the fries were soggy. This time it was also a little burnt. The portion was pretty big though for $8 worth. I shared a side of fries with 2 other people and there was still half left over at the end. I will probably try a different side here the next time I come back since soggy fries 2x in a row ain't going to cut it.
I finally got to try this place out. So I give the food a 4 star, good burger, solid ingredients and was cooked well. I ordered the farm burger which was duck bacon, honestly it tasted like normal bacon nothing different but bacon is always good so... Fried egg was cooked good too. The Parmesan fries we ordered had great flavor but weren't cooked that well, I think some were over cooked and some were under cooked so there was much consistency there for me. Long wait for parties of 3 or more so be prepared. I will for sure come back just might come on a more down time so it's not so busy and I can try one of their shakes which looked amazing.
Overall, very good. 5 stars for the jalapeno popper appetizer. 5 stars for the onion rings....6, if possible!  The burger was good, not great. That's the reason for 4 stars. But I will definitely go back.
This location is located in the casino area of the PH Hotel, just inside the strip entrance doors.   The wait is usually about 1-1.5 hours, so be prepared for that.  The nice thing is they will take you cellular number and page you when your table is ready.  That means you can hit the mall and shop while you wait.!. . The burgers are really really good.  My girlfriend loves the Brittania.  The onion rings are awesome and their special ketchup is top notch.  I'll definitely be going back!!
Came here for lunch on a Saturday and got seated right away. The hostess was super friendly and did their best with every request.. . We ordered their pork belly bao bun as an appetizer and was blown away. It was juicy flavorful fatty pork inside a soft fluffy bun. Thinking about it creates drool right now. . . For burgers we got the euro which has arugula and goat cheese and the hells kitchen burger which has jalapeno and a roasted tomato. We were really impressed with the harmony of flavors.  Very well paired and extremely delicious. . . The burger patty was cooked perfectly. Pink center and juicy. . . Also check out the staff. Besides everyone being ridiculously good looking,  they all worked like a well oiled machine. Super efficient and friendly. Will definitely return when in Vegas.
Most amazing burger of my life, and has ruined all other burgers for me!. . The Hells Kitchen burger with a shake! Mmmmm!
Amazing food and worth the 20 min wait in line . Hell's Kitchen burger was the best great flavor and not too spicy. The farm burger was good but hell kitchen burger was the winner! . Waiter was quick and attentive!
Overall: The service is absolutely atrocious and the food is good. Prepare for $35-40/person for a burger, fries and drink.. . We really looked forward to Burgr, and if you are a fan of Ramsay's you will notice the menu follows his ideas. It is simple, small and straight-forward.  They try to incorporate technology as they have iPad's for the drink/dessert menu and at the end of the meal provide a survey that you use an iPod for.. . Overall, there was a nice selection of beers on tap. The food was good, not the greatest burger I have ever had, but it was definitely a good burger. The Parmesan Fries were pretty good too.  Most couples split an order of fries.. . What ruins the food though is the horrible service. The servers seem only interested in bringing your food and not seeing if you are doing fine. While we were eating out meal, our server interupted us to ask if we wanted dessert before we were even done our food.  Then, while still eating our food (after turning down dessert) our bill was tossed onto the table.. . Usually these sort of restaurants in Vegas have great service, service that makes you forget about having to wait for your food. But the horrible service took away from the entire experience. . . I cannot recommend this restaurant. While the food is good, it is no better than many other places in Vegas and definitely no cheaper. But the service is absolutely horrible compared to them,and why put up with horrible service when you have many other choices?
Came to BurGR with my friends before we departed ways as our weekend in Vegas has came to an end. We got here at about 12pm on a Monday and our group of 6 was seated almost instantly. . . The waitress told us it was going to be about 20 minute wait to get our burgers. We ordered our fries and shakes to come out while we waited for the burgers. We got sweet potato and Parmesan truffle oil fries. Both were good- but the House Ketchup made both fries AMAZING!! (and I don't even like ketchup). . . We got our burgers. I got the hells kitchen and it was tasty. My friends enjoyed there's as well- they got the euro, bleu cheese and american.  The creme brulee and Oreo shake was also very delicious! Something that we never even heard of before. . . Overall we had a good experience at BurGR and will be recommending it to our friends when they visit Las Vegas
The wait was less than they quoted. Innovative text when table is ready. Our server was perky and a pleasure to deal with. Christine was working the pass and while the good took a bit to get out it was worth it. Only downer was the obvious stack of fries orders under a heat lamp and ours seemed not as fresh as the burger.  Had the all American and was cooked to perfection. Tasted delicious and was very juicy.  Son said his was the best cheeseburger ever and that is a strong endorsement.  Christine signed a menu for us for our 25th anniversary.  Great experience.
A group of us were in Vegas for a bachelorette party and the bride's mother-in-law invited us to lunch here on our first day before we started the festivities. Despite being called off the wait list, we still had to wait over 20 minutes before a table finally freed up.. After we did get seated, it took forever for our waitress to check on us and service was just plain bad for the rest of our meal as it was impossible to flag anyone down for anything.. . We ended up ordering truffle parmesan fries & sweet potato fries to share - the fries were pretty good. I got the southern yardbird burger - the meat is very tender and juicy but the burger is SO large that it's almost impossible to eat.. . Overall, not worth it IMO to wait in long line for crappy service and slightly above average food.
His burgr is great.  Juicy, flavorful, and satisfying.  Tried the jalapeno poppers (spicy but good my mouth is watering now) and onion rings (pretty good).  But what is really bombtastic is their shakes.  SO good, especially with the creme brulee pudding in it.
Was there this past weekend, wait for about an hour for a group of six. . Service was excellent! Like honestly, our waitress was super friendly and nice. I got the farm burger and shared Parmesan fries with my gf. I got the farm burger with an over hard egg and it was great. The fries were ehh alright, wish they were cheesier or something. But the burger was amazing
Pricing: Good-Expensive. Expensive for a burger joint, but cheap for a "classy" restaurant.. Quality: Excellent. All the flavors just came together.. Turnaround: Good. Just about right.. Service: Good-Excellent. They split the burger for us without needing to ask.. . I have never been to a "classy" burger joint before as I am use to fancyrestaurants being Italian or French in nature. The pricing is high for a burger, but this is not the standard burger as noted by how everything just melded together. We ordered the cookies and cream shake, parmesan fries, Hellfire Wings, and the Hell's Burger. The shake comes with an upper layer of slightly torched creme-brulee pudding that went perfect with the cookies and cream shake below. The parmesan fries comes with three different dipping sauces, a tangy ketchup, something else similar to ketchup, and a garlic aioli. This was one of the best garlic aioli I have ever tried and I would have ended up cleaning that dipping tray if I was not full from all the food we ordered. The Hellfire Wings was a perfect combination of aroma, taste, and aftertaste. I judge buffalo wings first by the fragrant scent of different spices, then the actual taste of savoriness mixed with spices and a hint of sweetness, and then a lingering spiciness that travels across the tongue. These wings hit the first two perfectly, but I found the lingering spiciness weaker than I would like. The Hell's Burger is a dry burger meaning no sauce so if this is not your cup of tea, do not pick this. Given that, the jalapeno, although spicy, did not overpower the burger and when mixed with the creamy avocado, everything just clicked into one another. The burger was of ample size and cooked just right in a toasty bun that was equally delicious. Compared to the food, I really have nothing much to say about the turnaround. The food came neither too quickly or too slow and at the right order: shake, appetizer, and then entree. We were seated right next to a pay station so there was always a server at hand when we needed anything. I do commend them for being proactive and knowing to help us cut our burger because we would obviously share since we ordered only one burger between the two of us.
I had VERY high expectations for this place, simply because of the GR name attached to it, and I am a huge food network fan. But maybe because of those high expectations, this place didn't quite deliver for me ):. . I split the farm burger & truffle fries with a friend. And the burger was good, yes, but not amazing. Admittedly, everything was well cooked, nicely made, and beautifully presented, but the burger just seemed to be missing something. I think maybe I would've liked some lettuce or tomatoes in my burger? Some kind of veggies to balance out the patty and the egg? The fries were good, but not noteworthy either. Their house ketchup was different, and I probably would've preferred just plain-ol' heinz.. . Anywho, overall, the burgers were good, just not as good as I would've expected from GR. Maybe if the bar hadn't been set so high, this place would've gotten 4 stars instead of 3. But solid burgers, decently priced for being on the strip, just don't expect amazing.
First I love GR! I was/am so excited to get to eat here. I ordered the Britannia burger, which had mango chutney, cheddar and arugala. It was delicious but unfortunately it wasn't cooked consistently through out (very pink on one side and well on the other side). My son got the Hell's kitchen burger, which he said had the heat but didn't actually taste like jalapeno. The fancy ketchup with the fries... curry and chipotle weren't my chip of tea but my son liked the chipotle. Service was great.atmosphere was really nice.  I will come again!
Burger was fair, fries cold. Not Ramsey quality at. He would be throwing the food all over the place. No value for your dollar, too many other options
Great option if you want good food and a low hassle restaurant that's on the strip. The burgers were decent, but we just wanted a quick meal that wasn't at a fast food chain or a high end restaurant. Location can't be beat. There was a short wait though, maybe five to ten minutes.
This is the best burger and fries I have ever had! We ordered the Euro burger and Parmesan truffle fries. Excellent!
I ordered the Farm Burger and I am certain I will never find another burger that delicious anywhere else as long as I live. Thanks for ruining all the rest of the burgers that will enter my life Ramsey!!!
Best burger and dining experience I have had for this category of dining. . . Great people working here first of all, prompt and attentive service.  It shows that everyone was knowledgeable and experienced. ..even down to the eye contact.. . Food was hands down amazing.  Homemade sauces, bread, and fresh ingredients never disappoint. . I went with 4 others so we tried an array of items.  My Gordon Ramsay burger was a new, off the menu item that has only been available for 3 days...so I had to get it.  It was a hog (pork patty) full of flavor, cooked medium with a charred crust, toasted buns with white and black sesame seeds.  And the lettuce mix has chives in it...so thoughtful.  . . Overall, get the hog burger or pork patty burger...it is just more tasty.  Truffle fries and onion rings were delicious too.  This is the only BurGR location,  so come here when you are in Vegas!  Come when they first open, less wait time.
Ok I am going to give this a 5 star review the food was over the top! The shakes were incredible , they made to order burgers for us which was great, even the Ice Tea for this southern boy was increbile.   The sauces that pair with the onion rings fries and sweet potatoes fries are paired well. The only thing is you have 30 beer taps and only one dark beer on tap come on GR at least change that.  Will definitely come back again
First of all, the customer service was top notch. Annie, the manager, was phenomenal! She diffused a customer situation promptly and with a smile and even handled it with security enforcement once the situation called for it. She was great in standing her ground and protecting her staff. . The jalapeno poppers were AMAZING and I don't even like spicy foods! The presentation was wonderful and the portion was perfect for my husband and I to share. I don't remember what burger my husband ordered, and I actually don't remember seeing him eat it! It was gone so fast! He loved it! I orderedthe Euro burger and was a little apprehensive at first, but after the first bite, I knew I made the right choice! Hands down, this is the best burger I have ever had! Nothing compares to this, and I wish there was a restaurant of his here in Chicago. Even the drinks were exceptional! We ordered everything our waitress recommended and we were more than satisfied with all of her choices! She even sold us on a second drink (which we weren't going to get) but she gave it to us to go!!! :) Our overall experience here was beyond words. From Annie the manager to our waitress, from the appetizer to the entree, from the presentation to the proportions, every single moment was wonderful. We will ALWAYS come back every time we are in Las Vegas, and anywhere else we travel that has a BurGR restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant, and always ask to meet Annie. She is wonderful and it would be a treat just to say hello to such a wonderful person and complete your experience at BurGR in Las Vegas.
It's better than Red Robins at least.... . Food is underwhelming in flavor and creativity. . . The Gordon Ramsey brand could learn a lot from much better burger places from the PNW such as; Quinn's, 8oz Burger, and Biwa.. . Supposedly they reinvented the milkshake too... Into that jello pudding you buy from the grocery.  . . Also... The French fries were chewy.. . iPads with a terrible web-based application used as a drink menu offer a very awkward experience. . . If you're a foodie... This is not a place for you.
I have been looking forward to coming here for quite a while. The wait was not too long at around noon on a Saturday. Asked to be seated at the counter facing the kitchen which was a pretty cool seat. The burger was pretty good. I got the European burger. Also got a shake and it taste like someone took a bottle of caramel and put a straw in it. Way way way to much to think about drinking. Maybe that's why they give you a straw like boba. . . I would go back if the wait wasn't too long but the burger was good minus the wow factor. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Great food there. Drinks were a bit pricey though. The burgers were cooked perfectly. Service was excellent. Our waitress was amazing she was pretty fast with things and very thorough with explaining the menu.. . I had the fury wings as an appetizer and that was delicious. The parmasean fries I wasn't too crazy about. The. For entree I had the Hell's Kitchen burger. The pepper gave it a nice spice to it. . . Def would love to go back again!
Best burger I ever had! This place was fantastic! I've always wanted to eat at Ramsay's restaurant. The burgers are so delicious and full of flavor. The service is great and couldn't be more pleased! Our food also came pretty quick which really surprised me since this restaurant is packed full of people. Definitely eating here when I visit Vegas again!
A highly recommended place to eat! We waited in line for 45 minutes before seating (for two people) so I suggest you make reservations or as to sit at the bar. The line got really hot either from all the people in line or the flames right by the line... Not such a good choice. I started off with the jalapeno poppers which were amazing! The thing that really made them stand out to me was the sauce, I loved it. For dinner I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and added spicy mayo to it and I fell in love although it was pretty tricky to eat. I also got a side of fries which disappointed me, they were bland. I tried the fries with the truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup both sauces tasted bland until I decided to mix them and it tasted really good. For dessert I tried their shake #4 (oreo) and I am not very much of a shake person but I definitely enjoyed it. Only thing that disappointed me was the fries, but overall it was great.
I'm such a Gordan Ramsay tv fan, this was on my checklist of places to eat! . . LOCATION: The first restaurant to the left when you enter Planet Hollywood from the Strip, you won't miss it because it has real flames encased in glass but it's not hot.  . . LINE/WAIT: My friends flew in Friday night so we got here around 11:15pm? We checked in at the counter, gave them my cell phone so they could text me when the table was ready. We took some pictures in front of the flames and the total wait was maybe 10-15 mins. I love this text waitlist so if it was any longer we could just wander about. . . FOOD: My bf and I had eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we just split the Hell's Kitchen Burger. They were nice and actually split it in half for us and brought an extra plate. I liked it, it was just the right amount of spicy but it wasn't the best burger of my life, which sadly I was expecting. We also ordered regular fries and my friends got the truffle fries.  Both fries were meh. They were both super hot (temp) but still kinda hard and airy at the same time. The truffle fries and regular fries all came with different dipping sauces. None of them blew my mind.  . . I was also excited to try the shake since they looked so good on yelp!  We split the #1 (caramel pudding + chocolate shake+ toffee cookie). The menu says "shake'" but it LITERALLY is pudding. When I think shake, I just assume ice cream shake and so this was SO not what I was expecting. It was like eating a jello-pudding cup of thick chocolate PUDDING with a layer of caramel on the top 1/3 of it.  :( . . OVERVIEW: Certain expectations are sometimes the worse because this happens where I wasn't blown away and I don't agree with most of the yelpers. The burger was good but I wouldn't come back here. Glad I got a check off my food list though! . . TIPS and stuff:. *Make sure you give your TR card before they bring you the check. I forgot but the waitress was nice enough to re-run it. . .  *Here's a link to the full menu: http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/content/dam/phv/Dining/Casual/burgr/GRBurgerMenu_9_15_2013.pdf. . *Also... I didn't know this until we sat down.. BurGR.= BurGordanRamsay. Haha
Great experience! Tasty burgers cooked perfectly, first time I've had duck bacon and it didn't disappoint. Exceptional service and delicious cocktails, definitely recommend as a must eat at spot in Vegas!
Nice selection of beer on tap- Had a Perino. Decently priced. . Had the devil dawg, brittania burger, sweet potato fries, and the jalepeno poppers. Everything tasted amazing and fresh. The oreo shake with caramel pudding was to die for. The staff was very friendly and helpful at the bar. The hosts were efficient and very friendly as well. Mike was our server and we are so lucky to have had him :). Congrats BurGR, you made a fan out of us!
Huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, however the hells kitchen burger I ordered was not as expected. I ordered to go and waited half an hour for my food to arrive. When I bit into the burger it was overly salty, as if the person who was seasoning the meat dropped a whole canister of salt into the patty. It's probably because I ordered around 11:45pm and they close at 12am so they didn't care about the standards and said "f" it, they can't complain after we close. So disappointed.
I could honestly write this whole review about how delicious the onion rings were but for the lack of room I will just talk about how amazing my experience was overall.. . I have been dying to try this place for years and when I finally got her I was in awe. Only Gordon Ramsay would design a restaurant with a wall made completely out of glass and fire. Coming here I was prepared to go all out when it came to both the drinks and food. I ordered the chili dog, onion rings, original burger and coffee shake...I know thats A LOT but hey you have to take advantage of the situation especially if Gordon Ramsay is involved. . . The onion rings were so crunchy and seasoned to perfection. Just writing this post my mouth begins to water. The shake was crazy too. There was chocolate pudding on the top andcoffee shake on the bottom. A serious sugar overload but went great with the whole fancy diner feel of the whole place. The burger and hot dog were also delicious. Both loaded with all sorts of toppings that I would have never expected to be so delectable. . . If there is such a thing as an orgasm in your mouth then this place will be sure to give you one.
Do not leave Vegas without stopping in.. . Let's get it out of the way. My only complaint was how noisy the place is ... but, it is PH and it is Vegas.. . The burgers are out of this world. Price is great value.. . Do not skip the appetizers ... onion rings are like nothing you have every had and even non-ketchup eaters will dig on the chipotle infused ketchup. The jalapeno poppers, served in individual shot glasses with a unique ranch/ bleu chess blend are a must ... good luck finding the one with seeds before you bite in!. . We were too full for the shakes at dessert but they looked amazing.. . Our server might have been the best in Vegas. Well trained, passionate about the food and the experience, she went out of her way and delivered 5-star dining service in a "burger joint".. . For us GF diners, they will wrap the burgers in lettuce.
Came here with another couple for a late dinner. The burgers were delicious but I don't think the $15 price tag is necessary but, hey, it's Vegas, everything is expensive. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. The wings were very good, not dry at all and flavorful.  Our appetizer, the truffle fries and wings arrived on time but our main course was taking a long while. She went to go check on it and discovered that the ticket had gotten lost or misplaced. She immediately retook our order (mostly from memory) and we had our food in less than 10min! Cocktails were also very well made and we each enjoyed 2 of them. I recommend the Whiskey Lemonade!
Another pricey Vegas restaurant that's mediocre at best. My burger was good but nothing special, it was kind of lacking until I requested the spicy mayo.  The fries were ok, plenty to share between two people. The dipping sauces were different and fun. Was it worth $25 for a burger,1/2 and order of fries and a glass of water? Not really.
Best burger of my life. I got a new one he just made on his show 2 weeks ago. Like the farm burger but with pepper relish, avocado, shredded lettuce. So glad I stopped in. The staff is very upbeat and friendly. Will visit on another vegas trip for sure.
Long wait. Burger was decent. Habit burger is better. Its fancy and unique though. Clean and the service was great. But FOOD FOOD FOOD is the main thing. and it is just, Decent..
Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 8 people. The wait was about an hour... but that's to be expected. Got the farm burger, and honestly, I wasn't too wowed. Maybe my taste buds aren't refined enough for these gourmet burgers, but I didn't see the appeal of it or the fries. We got all three different kinds of french fries and none of them seemed to be worth the price. . . Overall, if you're a simple eater like me, don't dine here.
Yum! I'm so bummed I was too full of burgers, onion rings (make sure you get those) and truffle fries, to taste the shakes! Cutest little waitress, who was top notch! Go! Great experience!
So we got lucky on our recent stay at PH and the line at lunch time for BurgR went quickly.  The staff was great and the food choices made it tough to choose.  There was a special Gordon Ramsay burger that was delicious and the fish and crisp sandwich was so good! We got plain fries and onion rings and the came with the tastiest dipping sauces.  Especially the ranch with cheddar cheese dip! . If you are in Vegas, go there for a really great burger!
WOW. What can I say-- WOW. WOW. WOW. The EURO burger is amazing! I don't know if its because I went from vegetarian to gradually eating meat , but the food here is amazing. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is conveniently located in Planet Hollywood perfectly located where my sister and I went to watch a concert. Coming out from Britney's Piece of Me concertthis just completely sealed the deal with my overall evening experience. The concert was great and I just had a midnight snack craving so when I saw Gordon Ramsay's Flaming Signage I knew this was it. For the first time, the line and the Flaming Sign made me curious about what the fuss was all about. I tried the EURO BurGR and it was sOooO Goood. All the ingredients complemented my burger, it wasn't too heavy and it wasn't too plain it was just PURFECT. As for the Parmesan Truffle Fries, it was good, but it wasn't the best that I have had. The fries were crispy, but I couldn't taste the texture of the potato the creates the flavor within the french fries. The fries were over cooked and too hard for my preference. Otherwise this place would have been perfect. This is definitely a must go to place just to experience the BurGr but also the ambiance and evening hype. . . . RECOMMENDATION: MmmMmm.... Good*- MONEY-SAVER compared to other restaurants. . 1. Euro BurGr (BEST Burger I have ever eaten in Vegas 4.7/5)) ---WAY better than Bobby Flay's Burger  . . 2.  Vegetarian Style Euro BurGr (Custom Made) (3/5). . 3. Parmesan Truffle Fries (3.7/5)
The line was a little ridiculous for a Tuesday evening for what turned out to be an alright burger. It was flavorful enough, but something about it was missing a gourmet flare. . . Nice beer selection, though.
They have a great mix of burger choices. The size looked a little small at first, but really was perfect. We had the Hells Kitchen burger which came dropped with roasted jalapenos, guacamole, and cheese. The meat was cooked medium and was really juicy on a black and white sesame.. . I recommend the onion rings. The portion is perfect for two and were fried to perfection.. . The one thing we had which we did not like at all was the Pork Belly Sliders. The pork belly was cooked fine, but it had a flavor profile that I did not like. This was on an Asian bun and paired with traditional pickled vegetables that to me seemed a little over bearing and harsh.. . Would defiantly go again.
3.5 stars. . Had the farm burger. Not bad. But not blown away either. For the price, a little expensive considering you don't get fries, but it is Vegas. . . Service was great though.
The pudding shakes alone make the line, long wait, and price worth it! I went here Labor Day weekend with the hubs twice! Saturday we came around 1pm and there was a 1 hour wait. You need to check in with the hostess and leave your cell number where they can text you. WARNING: that system isn't fool proof meaning you might NEVER get notified. We were told our wait was going to be 45min to an hour. After 45 minutes and no text I checked with the hostess that originally took our names to see how much longer. Well she couldn't find our names on her list? She went to the main hostess and she couldn't find it either. She remembered that I was there earlier. Obviously I had a less than pleased look on my face so they seated us next. But anyhow aside from that service was great and the shakes even better.. I'll sum up what we ordered on both days. Difference: Wait was a lot less shorter by showing up when they opened at 11am on Sunday. I was dying to try shake #4 Oreo so that's why we went back.. . Wings: flavor is great with a spicy kick. Husband really liked it and the portions were decent.. . Pork belly buns: these were soft and most with a sweet flavor to the pork belly making almost like. BBQ type appetizer. . . Blue burger: this was just ok. The blue cheese is stronger than what I was normally used to and that's why it had a very distinct flavor along with the arugla. I wouldn't order this one again bc it was just ok.. . Hells Burger: this has tons of flavor and was really good. I'm not a fan of avocado but if you are this burger is for you. I would order this again just without the avocado. . . Parmesan Fries: good with the aioli dipping sauce. But I think the fries themselves are dry. Would not order this again. . . . Now on to the best part and why I would come back here.. . Coffee shake: the coffee shake portion of this is amazing! It's like sipping a mocha mudslide.. . Oreo shake: amazing creme brulee pudding and if you're an Oreo fan this does the trick. . I'm a sucker for desserts and the concoction of gourmet pudding with shakes is brilliant! . Lol . .

The Lines kinda ridiculous here so if I were you you should go really early. I remember the wait for us is three hours!! Crazy. So we decided to go the next day instead and really early. Even though we were there early we still had to wait for an hour since we had a large group. . . The place itself is nice but it's super cold. I was cold most of the time and I couldn't really enjoy my food so I had to ask the server to lower down the ac. Other Han that it's not bad of a place to eat burger. The atmospher is very friendly and typical burger place. . . I order the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was super gooood! I didn't expect it to be that spicy but over all it was good. I was a bit disappointed with the presentation of the burger I mean it looked plain. But I guess it's just a burger. My friend ordered the truffle fries and it was sooooo good with the sauce on the side! .  . Love this place!
Food is solid, which I expected from a Gordon Ramsay establishment.  I ordered the Britannia burger (recommended) both times.  The first time, we went during the mid-afternoon when the place was starting to slow down from the lunch crowd.  Burger came out perfect, truffle fries (a must) were solid.  The second time, we went during dinner time.  The food was good, but not as up to snuff as the first time.  The price is what it is, considering the location. . . Prepare to wait on line.  The wait is unnecessary long, considering how many empty tables I saw when I left the restaurant.  Not sure if it is a staffing issue or a "let's make it look prestigious" issue.  Doesn't take anything away from my opinion of the place, though.
We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.. . Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. . . "Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. . . "Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. . . "American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. . . "Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.. . I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.
The food & atmosphere were great. I wish it weren't so expensive, we would have gone more than once; $170 before tip is a bit expensive for us. But we enjoyed the experience. The best beef wellington ever.
I am disappointed to write this review. This is my fifth time here and after. This experience I feel that burGr has lost it's luster.  We ordered the jalepeno poppers and they were cold inside. The waitress didn't come around to even complain about it to. The burger was eh. Not bad not good. Fries were horrible. Onion rings were delicious though.
