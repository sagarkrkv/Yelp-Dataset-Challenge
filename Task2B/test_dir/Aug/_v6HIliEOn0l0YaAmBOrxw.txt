We booked through Expedia for our honeymoon. First off we got a great deal for hotel and flights. Then when we checked in and let them know it was our honeymoon we got a complementary upgrade to a strip view room, just by asking! We received buy one get one free coupons for the buffet (x2) and cirque du soleil show! They sent us champagne to celebrate our honeymoon. . Room service was great. They came by twice if we were in the room the first time to clean it. . . Yes we lost money gambling. . . Yes Snr Frogs is for youngins trying to party hard. . . Don't go to Kahunaville. Did not sit well with us. . . The steak house was good. The breakfast place was good (the coffee house). . . Don't do breakfast buffet. But dinner was delicious!. . Overall we are very happy with our choice to stay at "ti".
DO NOT STAY HERE. My purse was stolen at the pool and while we were waiting (almost 20 minutes) for security to come another guest came to report their bag was stolen as well. Security took our report but gave me wrong information about filing a police report. I later learned if you don't report it in person to the police (rather you do it over the phone) then the Las Vegas police do not investigate. This is why TI tells you that you can call the report in. I think either they don't want the police investigating or it's their staff doing the theft. Then we requested new rooms keys since one of ours was stolen, they were surprised at why we would request such a thing. There was no apology, no compensation. I had to have my passport sent FedEx to me since my license was stolen and TI wanted to charge me a $7.00 handling fee for receiving the package, I told them no way, I'm not paying that. Also, we had a medical situation in front of the Mirage and my friend called TI and asked them to have a cab sent to the front of the Volcano at the Mirage on Las Vegas Blvd. and they refused, they said "no", that's the Mirages problem not ours. Terrible service, one evening we saw people filling out security reports in the casino because their wallet was stolen. The hotel itself also does not compare to some of the others, it's outdated, and the layout is terrible, the parking garage is really far from the room elevators and lobby. It's a little lower class as well compared to Caesars, the Wynn and Mirage etc... Never once did the management call to apologize or compensate us in any way. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.
Ok, so I am giving this place 5 stars because our stay was great here! I have stayed in some of the other more ritzy places, but when my husband booked us at TI for 2 days...I thought, ok let's see how this goes.  I was not sure what to expect, but when we got to our room it was really nice.  The room itself smelled clean, the sheets, bedding and all that was clean.  The bathroom was nice and tidy.  We were up on the 32nd floor and the view from our room was amazing.  We could see the entire strip, we even watched The Mirage fire show from our room.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The casino was entertaining as well.  I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again!
If I could give them zero stars I would. Do NOT go here if you want to have fun in Vegas.  The employees here are extremely rude and the pool area is filled with even more rude employees. My brother waved hi to the life guard and got kicked out of the pool area because he could "potentially TOUCH a girl." EXCUSE ME!?!?THIS ASSUMPTION IS DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL. Even the people around were appalled and agreed that he should not be kicked out.  Absolutely absurd.
Love the location. Across Venetian/Palazzo/Wynn/Fashion Show mall, close to all the action on the strip. We stayed here because we were coming in Friday midnight and got a cheap rate on hotwire and wanted to save money since we got the Palazzo for Saturday night. As we got in it seemed like hip hop night at the bar (gilleys I think ) and lots of rougher people around as we walked towards registration. Actually the next day was also rougher crowd. Not as bad a circus circus though.. We got a suite and it was HUGE! but the decor was very dated. 90's almost cheesy! with reddish marble in the bathrooms. (there were 2) and those alien looking lamps, the ones were its springs into 5 different bulbs hanging over the sofa. Also, it didn't feel completely clean. The tub felt gritty, like maybe they didn't wash the ajax off and saw grime on the handles. The lights were so dim that I couldn't examine everything else completely. I know it's an older hotel so I wasn't expecting anything fancy and we just used it to sleep. I wouldn't stay here if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room. . It's just way different than when I started coming here as a child back when it used to be kid friendly with the arcade and pirate show. I remember coming here when they had social house sushi and celebs were dining maybe 10 years ago and it's just gone downhill. This is a cheap decent hotel in the middle of the action. (I'd pick this over Monte Carlo/Excalibur/Luxor/NYNY/Ballys but not over Mandalay Bay/MGM/Caesars (other 4 star hotels)
For the Pool....$140 for Cabana which wasn't bad....service was horrible, they honestly had 3-4 girls for the entire pool, to include Cabana patrons.  Music was good overall, not a bad way to spend an afternoon....
Before you "cash out" at TI, read this. On the afternoon of Sunday, August 3, 2014, following some lackluster video poker rounds at a group of progressive machines, I decided to stop my losses and printed my voucher of 90.00. I took that same ticket to a nearby redemption machine, inserted it in the green flashing slot, and whoosh- it was gone. Nothing happened. The viewscreen never changed, and as there is no call button on those kiosks, I hit the service button on an adjacent slot machine and waited. I told the attendants who came to help about what happened, and they first wanted to know what machine I printed it from, and I showed them the machines we were playing. My transaction appeared on the log screen with others- I wasn't using a players' card. I reiterated that I put a voucher in the redemption machine, and one of the attendants said "no you didn't." I said "CHECK THE MACHINE." I was then told "we can't open that redemption machine. " TI never stopped the ATM machine, and others were using it, apparently without issues except for a very upset patron nearby trying to be heard. I asked "Can you look at the video? There seem to be cameras everywhere." "Yes", they said.  But their denials and implications continued and they refused to pursue any video proof of me using the machine. I was made to look like a fool in front of other patrons at their games, and after promising to "look into it" they got back with me and said they didn't find a voucher for 90 dollars and "could not see my face" on any purported video. The most they offered was 43.50 from another transaction on one of the poker machines, it was not mine; I remembered very clearly the amount I cashed out. My partner accepted the 43.50 in hopes of calming me down, but what it comes down to is that they got away with keeping 46.50 of my money and no apologies for anything beyond the frustration. I suggest if you are playing there and end up with a cash voucher, get a casino employee and a witness to watch you cash it. Maybe then if one doesn't get scanned and vanishes into it, you will have a better recourse than I did. I left the casino humiliated and made out to sound as if I was lying, and I will never spend another dime there, period. Angela, the slot manager, was the only TI rep I dealt with that handled me with respect; the floor attendants were the worst. And while I'm here, on an unrelated note, avoid their breakfast buffet at all costs- it is depressingly bad.
I was in Las Vegas to attend ASD trade show and TI hotel was one of the hotel referred by the show , i got a room at 33rd flood facing strip , which had a great view, but room smelt bad, furnitures as you can see on picture was dirty with dark spots, nobody was in charge of taking care of hallway's leftover dishes , one ice bucket with few glasses were stayed there for 24 hours , towels looks old and some dirty.. Never never go back there.
Schones Hotel, direkt am Strip gelegen.. . Einchecken dauerte 10 Minuten, verlief ohne Probleme.. Geraumige groe Suite mit Aussicht auf den Strip, zwei Badezimmern. Gemutliches, groes King-Size Bett. Whirpool. Room-Service top. Casino ist okay, besondere Empfehlung: The big Wheel - aber vorsicht, Suchtgefahr ;). Auch das Buffet kann ich empfehlen, viel Auswahl zu einem fairen und normalen Preis fur Vegas.. . Einziger Kritikpunkt, Zwei Uhr Nachts, kann man auer Roomservice nicht mehr viel kulinarisches erwarten. Aber man kann ja immer noch nach drauen gehen.. . Daumen hoch, wenn wir mal wieder in Vegas sind, dann in diesem Hotel.
We bought the $59/night special through their website. No resort fee and included 2 for 1 dinner buffet. Room was clean and spacious. Room included microwave, safe, hair dryer, iron. Close to Caesars and the new LINQ. We would definitely stay again.
The rooms are clean and manicured, along with a great lobby and central location right next to everything. The valet service was abrupt when we first arrived and offered no help for our luggage, which is the main reason for the 4 star rating. Great place, Tao club across the street and shopping right next door. Definitely a clean and friendly hotel!
I can't quite give Treasure Island 5 stars because the rooms are missing some of the basics like a coffee maker and microwave, but what is provided is very nice and the beds are quite comfortable. There is a very small amount of black rot growing on the edge of the bath tub suggesting the place could stand a thorough cleaning although other than that, the room appears to be clean.. One major plus is a small safe that is activated by your choice of numbers.  It gives you peace of mind when leaving the iPad and jewelry in the room. The staff is helpful and polite and the casino is huge.the restaurants serve well prepared dishes and overall, the cost has been what we expected. The security is good.  You can't get close to the elevators or anywhere else like the pool or spa without showing your key card.
My sister and I had a wonderful time at Treasure Island recently. We have stayed at various locales in Vegas, including The Bellagio. This place is just as good as The Bellagio, in my opinion. Very nice, helpful dealers, awesome rooms, wonderful staff. I accidentally left $500 in the safe here and the wonderful staff member in lost and found helped me to retrieve it! That is amazing!  Good people who want to truly help you have a great experience = a great place to stay!
The room was very nice and reasonably priced. The restaurants prices are double what you'd pay if u just go outside the hotel and onto the strip. The pool is great and has a DJ on the weekends. We were given a BOGO coupon to the buffet. But we thought the food was gross. The hotel experience was a positive overall. Except the baggage check at the end. Since we had to check out at 11 we stored our luggage with the hotel until 1:30 so we could stroll around some more. When we picked it up, and didnt tip the guy. He's like "realy?! Thats it?!". What an ass. We just laughed at him. Who carrys cash in vegas just to tip the guy for doing his job. Smh...
Back in the day, Treasure Island used to be one of my favorite places to stay in Las Vegas.  I enjoyed staying here because for the price, the rooms were a very good value.  . . Alas, nowadays...I find Treasure Island to be just average.  The room rates are still fair, but compared to the competition I find my money better spent elsewhere.  You can stay at newer more modern Vegas properties on the Strip for the same or lower price.. . Another thing that I miss is the cool Pirate show in front of the property.  Yeah, it was a bit cheesy...but it was a cool "free" show.. . Although, I do not forsee us staying here again in the future, it is still a nice place to visit when walking along the Las Vegas Strip exploring all the casinos.
I enjoyed our stay at Treasure Island hotel, upon arrival we were treated very nicely everyone was so welcoming during our check in at the lobby there was a nice older lady making sure we were doing fine offered us some cold waters which was nice . We also got a free buffet for two which was very nice because being on the road for five hours the first thing we wanted to do is get out and eat. Our room was clean didn't see anything out of the ordinary in there like other hotels . The price is reasonable it also located close to everything . They also have a  tram service that running till 3am from The Mirage which helps a lot.  The restaurants at night are lovely music is loud and the atmosphere is great .
Clean room is where it ends.  Linens were torn, towels were like sand-paper.  We were grateful to be upgraded, but the hotel positively reeks of smoke, non smoking rooms included.  We walked through all the  properties on the strip and despite a recent upgrade/remodel, unfortunately TI is the WORST!!! They try in vain with coconut air freshener (pumped through every possible opening) to overcome it, but instead give the guests coconut ashtray scent.  Buffet is free for a reason, and that is the only reason you should go.  Never pay for this breakfast or lunch.  Better off at McDonalds for sure.  Staff is friendly and helpful throughout the property.  Pirate show is long gone.  We wouldn't stay there again for free.  Now... If you are a smoker, I bet it's just fine and an excellent value.
Wow, Treasure Island hotel rooms are dark, smelly, and have moldy bathrooms with water stained doors. I expected better. Stayed on the 24th floor. Nice View, but wow.  There's also a 28 resort fee. Not a clean freak, but expected the toilet seat to be clean. Yikes. I couldn't sleep thinking about that. Go somewhere else...
We like it. Found a mystery deal on Hotwire without knowing what hotel - ended up being TI $42, totally an awesome deal. . . We stayed in a King Bed room & it is (I'm typing this in the bed) really comfortable. The sheets and comforter are soft & cushiony but can't say the same for the towels - though that's always the case. The girl checking us in was professional. Though could have been a little friendlier.. . I didn't give it 5 stars because it's pretty dark in here WITH lights, the TV is really weird (but who cares you're sitting in the middle of entertainment city anyway) & our bathroom does not have a trash can (Ahem, Ladies) . . The bathroom is an awesome decent size.. . We'd probably stay again.
Seen better days. Location is good. Pricing is bait and switch. Dinged horribly for "resort fee". I've been here during corporate outings and had the fee removed. They even charged for early check-in. No, I'm not kidding. And there was nobody checking in but me. The rooms are adequate. Surely, okay if not for all the add-ons. Old Vegas respected the visitor. LV had become like New York of he past. If you are a sensitive traveler, do read the fine print. You will find problems here. Communication with the hotel was poor, prior to travel, and upon arrival.
A friend and I were there in mid-December, during one of Vegas's slowest times of the year.  That being said, we got an awesome rate (about $62 per night, and two of those nights were weekend nights).  We also didn't have to wait to check in, and we only waited about five minutes to check out.  All the staff members we encountered were very friendly and inviting, as well.. . Our room was on the fourteenth floor, and even though we didn't request a "strip view" room, we ended up with a pretty nice view of part of the strip.  The room was incredibly clean and comfortable.  It's clear that the rooms have been recently renovated, as the furnishings are all modern and new looking.  I'm a bit of a design snob, and I was fairly pleased with how our room looked.  My only qualm with our room was that there was no ventilation in the bathroom (at least not in ours), so it got steamy in there VERY quickly.  My friend and I actually had to shower with the door open.. . The casino is a little smokey and confusing to get around (both of which are to be expected), but there was a vast assortment of games.  I'm not much of a gambler, so we didn't spend a lot of time in here.  TI also pipes in a delicious-smelling fragrance of sugar cookies (or something similar) into the casino.  I would have that scent in my home if I could!. . The buffet was... eh.  There are better around the strip for the same price.  There's actually no phenomenal dining in TI, to be honest.  There IS, however, a Starbucks right outside the front doors, and there's a direct walkway from TI to Fashion Show Mall, and the mall has a big food court.. . OVERVIEW: Treasure Island is in a terrific location.  The hotel is fun and lively, and isn't stuffy.  The pricing is mid-range, and is a good "bang for your buck."  I recommend it!
Do not waste your time at this hotel. Don't be cheap like us, spend the extra dollars at a nicer hotel like the Encore, Wynn, MGM, Venetian, any hotel but this. Very poor communication with from management and staff. . . The first night we got there we weren't even able to get a key for any of the 3 rooms we booked because they said our name wasn't on those rooms even though we paid with our credit card. . . By the time we left and got back home there were a bunch of unauthorized charges on our card and when we called to question the charges TI told us all this bullcrap we were never informed about. . . Like I said, do not waste your time here. All the hassle almost wasn't worth my first trip to Vegas since I turned 21. . . Also, the coffee shop restaurant wasn't even that good. We were the only people in the restaurant at 1am and the service still sucked. . . Terrible staff, terrible management, terrible coffee shop/restaurant, just a terrible hotel in general. You're going to be in Vegas, might as well live like you're in Vegas.
The room wss well appointed and beautifully decorated, not to mention incedibly clean. . The bathroom was an absolute joy with fabulous bath products and a tub big enough for a romantic soak for two. . The bed was a dream and best of all there was virtually no noise. The staff were a delight, from the front desk to the room personnel. . . Thank you Treasure Island for making our stay a complete pleasure.  We are already planning a trip back.
