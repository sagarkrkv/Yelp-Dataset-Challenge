Have stayed here and there's much to do inside with casinos going on forever, many restaurants, bars and stores. The hotel towers are many so the place is busy with activity and people.. . The group I went with, like 15 people, had similar comments. The rooms were run down and not that clean. The maid service had just left my room upon my arrival. I saw her leave my room. There were wadded up Kleenex balls right outside my room and she just walked by them. Gross. I thought maybe she just didn't see them. On the third day there, I'm pretty sure someone in housekeeping had to have seen them but they were still there. . . I was there on business so it was hard to tolerate hearing slamming hotel doors ALL night long and partiers yelling down the hallways at 3,4 or 5AM with no regard to others.. . Summary: if you're there to party and gamble and are OK with semi clean rooms, this is the place for you.
We stay here all the time. We usually really like this hotel and casino. However the players club desk at this hotel is awful!!!!! They have a promotion where you play win free play. After standing in line for 30 minutes to see if I was eligible to play, I won 5 dollars and had to wait in line for another 30 minutes although one person at the desk was taking people with their tickets without standing in line. . . Horrible system! And why are there only two people working at 12 on a Monday!!!!!
Terrible experience overall at this casino. I went on three occasions and had terrible dealers each time.. . One of the dealers I had, Lee, an older Asian man, took the cake in the "Rude Dealer of the Year" category. He had a bad attitude during the whole game and didn't speak unless something little upset him. When I sat down to play and handed my ID to the pit boss, he yelled at me demanding my ID. I told him the pit boss had it and he had the gall to shake his head like I was in the wrong. He immediately talked himself out of being tipped. . . When I wasn't playing and was watching my friend play, I pat the table when my friend got an ace (good luck measure for the next card to be a face card, seen all over the Strip), and he BARKED at me saying "hey! I don't like that! You're not even playing!" Excuse me, we're trying to have a good time and you're just an asshole. I didn't reach towards the cards or the chips and every other dealer is okay with this. I barked back "I don't like YOU" and my friend and I both left.. . The New York New York would've made some money off of us if they had dealers who had better attitudes but they quickly affirmed that we would never be back. If you don't like your job as a dealer and can't be entertaining, especially in Las Vegas, you need to switch careers.
I'm hesitant on the 4 stars, sure this is Vegas and it's a tough market to compete in, but I still think they could do a little better. Our "updated" room may have been updated 10 years ago. The bathroom symbolizes nothing modern. The check in process wasn't enjoyable, the woman checking us in was rude and didn't care to help or want to accommodate us. The manager soon took control and helped us. The other staff around this MGM property are great! People in the south are usually super friendly, and that rule follows right through here. Sure the hotel is not as nice as Caesars or the MGM Grand, but it's still very nice, has a large casino, roller coaster, arcade and shopping area!
Stayed in the players suite ....the atmosphere is great...so much to do...the suite was about 800 Sq ft....lots of room and great place 2 take the kids...although that arcade is overpriced and so expensive $20 will burn in a few minutes with the kids!!!
Oh, my. If you like all the dirty and decrepit parts of New York City, yet not actually be in New York City, this place is for you. It smells of a million un-showered people smoking cigarettes, combined with a vat of Fabreze sprayed over it all to mask the stench. There isn't a surface that isn't in poor condition, from the entrance pavement in poor repair to the filthy doors to the worn-out carpets, this place could not be more down scale.  And the people...no comment.. . We went so my husband and daughter could ride the coaster. They seemed to enjoy it, but we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Perhaps it is unfair to NY NY that we had just come from Luxor, which is very, as the New Yorkers say, "classy," and NY NY casino was like going to a third world country by comparison.
I stayed here once a year and a half ago for work and couldn't remember why I didn't really like it then, other than the loathsome Chin Chin breakfast buffet. That work trip was otherwise hellish so maybe this hotel was the least horrible part of my stay, I don't know. Anyway, the Palms was completely booked up and this was the most convenient hotel to stay in that I wasn't scared would give me some kind of STD just from touching the sheets.. . Aaaaanyway, I remember why I hate this place. There's really no Verizon or AT&T service in the rooms, making tethered Internet useless, and the in room wifi is so slow I'd imagine I'd get better speeds on a satellite link in a dacha somewhere near Siberia. But I'm here for work, I'm not picking mushrooms in a forest so no useful Internet access is kind of a non-starter. . . Also, the food options here kinda suck. Chin Chin is miserable, Gonzales y Gonzales is kinda eh from my drunken recollections years ago, Il Fornaio is like a more expensive Spaghetti Factory, the sports bar that may still be here served me one of the worst steaks of my life....actually I've eaten at at lot of the restaurants here and I don't know why, I should have just crossed the street to the tram and gone to Mandalay.. . Also, my TV randomly turned on at 3:30am, and no, I did not bump the remote, it was on the far end of my nightstand, well out of reach, there was no kind of laundry bag for dry cleaning (which I like to steal for my dirty laundry), and somehow there was no shampoo or conditioner in my hotel room.. . Anyway, this would be one star, but at least they lived up to my expectations of not giving me an STD, I hope, and I think I won 50 bucks doing something stupid like doubling down on a 14 here years ago, so why not.
With a few final days in Vegas to fill in (and with cash to burn) we checked into the New York New York Hotel on the strip and made full use of our spa in our Jr suite, which felt like such a luxury after 10 months on the road in a minivan. . . The NYNY is known mostly for its amazing facade (a full New York skyline, complete with statue of liberty) and for the rollercoaster on the rooftop.  From our window we had a view of the first drop on the coaster and every few minutes were treated to the squeals of the riders.  Down in the lobby they have recreated an entire 'street' of NY eateries, hot dog and pretzel stands, souvenir shops, etc which make you feel like you are in a version (albeit a warped one) of the big apple.. . Overall my world was far from rocked though.  At over a hundred a night we seemed to get the room at the FAAAARRRR end of the corridor - it took 5 minutes at a time to get to the lifts!  The cleaners brutishly ignored the do not disturb sign and someone tried to access our room at 6.30am - if the bolt wasn't across we would have had an even nastier fright then the one we got. . . We were not provided with any of the promised amenities (newspaper, toiletries) and for $25 a day resort fee the internet was basically unsuable. We used our phone wifi. You don't get anything except a room for the price you pay.  Its pretty rubbish.  Our view (over the pool) was boring.  The front office staff were useless too... not their fault because they have to service so many people - but it felt so cold and clinical. They just didn't want to lift a finger to help.  We were just a number to them.. . One thing that bothered us was that we called ahead and asked if we could have a couple of packages sent - they said 'thats fine'.  But what they didn't say was 'there is a $12 fee per package to pick them up'.  Macys.com decided to send our order in a few packages, meaning we had to pay twice! We ended up giving the business centre about $50 in fees for packages, which was horrible since the $39 a night Super8 down the road not only let us have things sent there for free, but also provided brerakfast, let us use the office phone AND had amazing wifi! . . Another problem was the credit card fee on check in.  I had been very unlucky to have both my credit cards stolen the week before (I know - how unlucky can you get!).  They literally would NOT let me check in without one.  I offered to pay cash and they said it wasn't possible.  I ended up giving them my debit card, which is totally stupid since all I did was load enough cash onto it for the transaction... thats basically like paying cash anyway right?   Being that it was my Australian debit card the transaction cost me a small fortune... so thanks for that. . . I get it, people love to stay at places like the NYNY when they go to Vegas, but next time I will be spending less on boring, average hotel rooms and more on going out and having fun. Out of all the places I have stayed in the world (across 60+ countries) I would rate this as one of my least favourite hotels - due mainly to the lack of value you recieve for the price you pay.
We rented a "Park Avenue room with a view."  The "view" costs extra and is not worth it; our view consisted of the roller coaster, a beat-up roof, the airport and two hotels: Excalibur & Tropicana.   Based on the extra cost, I was expecting a strip view (not two hotels but the ability to see down the strip at night etc).  If I had to do it over again I  would not pay extra for a room with a view as it is nothing to pay extra for.  . . The room itself was clean and the beds were comfortable.  It is a large hotel so the walk to/from the elevators is a bit of a hike but we were expecting that as all the mega hotels are like that.  We were on the 16th floor and one thing we did not expect was the noise from the roller coaster.  I certainly knew it was there when we booked the room but I did not think about it running all day and well into the middle of the night.  The roller coaster itself makes quite a bit of noise and when people ride a roller coaster they scream...constantly. . . There is a $20 "resort fee" with the hotel which is a total rip off.  What you get is free "high speed" wifi (that works at a SNAILS pace...think back to the days of dial-up internet). You get a free newspaper with it (if you want to trek downstairs to the shop and ask for it but I don't know why you would want one anyway).  The fee also allows you to print an airline boarding pass (what a bargain at $20 a day...insert sarcastic face).  . . The hotel looks awesome from the outside and has an awesome decor inside (they also brought New York prices in for all the shops and food vendors...a soda is $3).  The staff were all friendly and the casino was pretty standard.   . . While the hotel is neat and the room was clean I would not stay here again.  You can come (for free) and visit the fun parts and stay at a better place.  I've been to Vegas several times and sayed everywhere from the Stratosphere, Rio, Palace Station, Tropicana, etc.  While I am not unhappy with my stay or the hotel, I enjoyed all my other stays at the other hotels better.
Great hotel, great price. This one is fairly cheap and has a great feel to it. I love the New York theme. . . Check in and out was quick and easy. When we checked in we left our bags with the bell hop since we arrived before 3:00. At 1:00 our room was ready, and the bell hop brought our bags up quickly. . . The room was nice. We had the Park Avenue room on the 29th floor. It was clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. Not rock hard but not super plush either. I though the decor was simple but nice. It wasn't over the top, but I liked it. It wasn't extremely plain. . . There's a lot to do in the hotel and around the area. The roller coaster is fun but at times can be painful. There's a lot of good food in the New York hotel, too. Although, I will say skip the starbucks. We got a tall coffee, one of the protein boxes, and a small sandwich and it was $17!!! And then they wanted to charge 50 cents for a cup of water. There's other places to get a quick bite in the hotel, but it was very early when we went and it was the only thing open. Just avoid it. . . The only thing I really didn't like about the pool is that it was small. Like really small. Other hotels have multiple pools and they are large! But this one was one tiny bean shaped pool that was only 4.5 feet deep. That part of the hotel could use some improvement, but other than that it's a good place to stay.
I stayed here previously at the Park Avenue view suite.. . Hotel room-I wasn't a fan of the room. For a suite it was kind of small. AC was strong but was very loud, good view of the strip, bathroom looked old and not renovated. It actually looked like a motel bathroom. Room decor was very 80s, big tv, comfy beds and pillows, walls were really thin. I could hear our neighbors having sex (it was kind of hot). . Hotel/accommodations- check in was by fast, elevators no line and fast, hallways clean, staff very nice, pool was rather small for the size of the hotel, wifi included in resort fee, valet was actually really quick.. . Restaurants-I have to say that this hotel has a ton of selections for food which I liked about this hotel. And a lot of choices to fit a person budget.. . Staff-service and staff was awesome. Everyone was welcoming and smiling, lots of staff and security. Felt safe and nice that staff acknowledges you.. . I would stay here again for the price.
Booked my room two months in advance with no issues and a conformation number that was sent via E-Mail.. . Upon arrival I noticed a very strong smell in the casino gaming area which appeared to be air freshener that was piped through the ventilation system for the gaming area. It was a very disgusting strong sweet aroma. I think it was to mask the cigarette smoke. I've stayed here in the distant past and always thought the air conditioner system was sufficient with no strong smells of cigarette aroma.  Anyway this freshener gave me a headache and was strong. It was absolutely terrible.. . I did in fact arrive early for check in ( 2 hr ) and was charged an extra $ 20.00 just so I could go to my room early which was already cleaned. RIP OFF!  I was told about this additional charge after they had finished processing my information for check in, how nice.. . The room was very out dated but clean. The bathroom had a tub shower combination with a sliding shower door.....very out dated, really?? The enclosure while standing in the tub taking a shower was tight and there was very little room to wash without hitting the shower door with your elbows ..... . This is 2014 , what happen to a big walk in shower. Does anyone really want to take a bath in a hotel tub sitting in someone's DNA from the last guest...not me. Anyway I would never think about a hotel tub in a nice hotel casino.The entire bathroom was very small about a 5 x 5 foot area, with the toilet situated right in front of the sink, thus cutting down the standing area. Having to step up and over the tub sides is approximately 14 to 18 inches, This could be a real issue for somone with limited mobility or the elderly. . . The room had popcorn ceilings,  really?? This is 2014!. Overall the room was clean and furnished nicely. The room air-conditioning worked fine but the thermostat was out dated and  no digital temp display. It was very difficult getting the correct room temperature at night. The bed was comfortable and pillows as well. . . The TV was a flat screen but the cable signal was absolutely terrible. The signal strength was scattered and the picture would freeze and completely shut off.. I was there for 5 days and the TV reception never got any better. REALLY THIS 2014! . . The restaurants were plentifully with various types of food available.To many to mention. . . On my first day at the hotel I had walked up to a center circular  bar and was met with an attitude from the bartender when I ordered a mixed drink. I had just sat down and wss fumbling with my money to insert into the table top Keno machine when he blurted out, you have to play to get a free drink. Made me feel unwelcomed right off the bat. He was just rude bottom line! Hope I didn't break the casino with a short pour of cheap liquor.....my wife had a similar experience at the same bar by another bartender. She ordered a Cadillac margarita while she was playing electronic Keno at the bar, she was served a watered down drink in a plastic cup and charged $ 11.00, yes eleven dollars!, REALLY??. . When she questioned the high charge and the fact the drink should of been free because she was gambling she was hit with an attitude from the bartender.He told her that premium drinks are not comped. It would of been nice to tell her this beforehand. She finally contacted a bar supervjsor and was refunded the price of the cocktail ....they need PR training here.. . The Casino is getting old and not really getting all the attention it really needs.. . The Starbucks within the casino charges more for the same drink's I get everyday elsewhere. I order the same two drinks that normally costs $9.60 elsewhere and here it is $11.84....REALLY??. . There was a lot of kids running around, and there is a arcade on the upper level with a roller coaster for a premium charge.. . Resort fees are charged everyday that you stay at the casino. $20.00 a day plus daily taxes. Some booking web sites will mention this and some won't. This can add up fast....just another way for hotel casinos to gouge for more and provide less in some cases. Everything has a tax associated with it, check your automated hotel bill on the TV in your room by going to the menu and looking at the itemized daily breakdown before you check out so you don't need CPR when checking out and not understanding the hidden tax.......Taxation and resort fees are absorbent and just another way for the hotel to make more by calling it Tax.......years ago there was no such thing!!. All the casinos have jumped on this bandwagon! . . The covered parking garage is connected to the hotel by use of a air conditioned pedestrian walkway but is a distance to the lobby and down one floor and you must navigate screaming kids as you pass by the arcade. . . The hotel also has walkways to other casinos above ground level that crosses over the busy Las Vegas traffic..a lot of walking but some have moving walkways that transport you.. . THATS IT......
New York - New York has a really fun and energetic casino, I had a blast even though I didn't do very well at the tables, though I did win some cash playing the Dark Knight slot machine.  . . The beaty music and city ambiance gives the place a youthful vibe that is palpable and contagious, plus it doesn't smell like piss.  It's also one of the better casinos to still have $5 blackjack, and did I mention there's a Dark Knight slot machine? It's not the slot machine you deserve, it's the slot machine you need.
I want to give a shout out to the management team. I had some issue but they resolved it. Assistant manager Jackie is a lovely lady and she's a smart manager who knows how to handle customers complaints. Brian at the concierge is a wonderful manager. Charles is a wonderful manager. Lastly, Tim of the risk management   Team, he's a super nice guy. Thank you for all your help to make my trip even more wonderful than I could possibly imagine. That one star missing only because of the bell boy joe who had a nasty attitude and threw my bags on the floor and left. I have got to give props to the management team at nyny. Customers aren't easy here and they handled it extremely well. Thanks.
Gonzales  Gonzales is a mexican restaurant inside the casino. I've been eating there for years but not anything recent. I ordered chicken fajitas. Normally this selection would be served sizzling hot when arriving at the table. This item came out luke warm and the beans and rice arrived on another plate.. . The rice and beans were only luke warm and only about 5 bites of rice and 5 bites of beans, no cheese!. The tortillas were luke warm...the service waiter was very good and attentive. no chips and salsa were served and chips and salsa have to be ordered as an extra cost.....most mexican restaurants will serve chips and salsa before you order....... . The chandeliers above the eating area need to be cleaned or shaved , they look hairy from dust and lint. Gross!. . That's it!!........ . . ******************Security Warning ***************. . I was a guest at this hotel for five days. during this time period I stayed in the same room and at my request refused any type of room service or maid service.. . I had brought a pair of mini canon binoculars into the room, upon check out the binoculars were gone, I realized this a few hours or less after I left when I needed the binoculars for sight seeing at Red Rock.. . I contacted the hotel house keeping, short version, the maid said she had not seen them. A security report was filed and this is under investigation. It's hard to believe they had not been located , there's a possibility that someone used a room key during tbe week I was there unbeknownst to me.. The only people in the room was my wife and I and the cleaning staff, who cleaned the room one time right after we left. We had refused room service the entire week. I really hadn't seen the binoculars for about three days but wasn't looking for them either, when we checked out they were just out of sight out of mind. I didn't realize they were missing for a few hours after check out. Update will follow upon conclusion of the hotel security investigation. Just be mindful of these circumstances. I was sloppy for not having a good inventory of my stuff when I packed.. . 08-27-14. Update Conclusion. . Hotel completed their investigation, nothing to support my claim other then my statement. Through their own follow up and interviews and checking electronic records of my room lock they feel the theft is unsubstantiated.  Bottom line I arrived at the hotel with the binoculars and somehow they were stolen from my room during my absence . They just didn't vanish into thin air...no compensation offered for replacement                                                                              ( WHICH I DIDN'T EXPECT ) and they closed their case.....I won't be staying here again for obvious reasons. Take the information for what it's worth.......... .. THERES ANOTHER REVIEW THAT TALKS ABOUT THEFT OF MONEY FROM ANOTHER GUEST'S ROOM!. . That's it!!....
Just checked in 2 hours ago - shocked . Room smells like old old house, windows so dirty so we will keep the curtains closed this time.. . We ordered room service, the food arrived 45 minutes later, cold. I decided to call Room Service, before I could say anything the lady on the other line said that she wants cash and if we are not paying cash the food will be taking away, she was super rude and didn't let me say a word. I asked her to charge this bill to our room.. . A half  hour later got a visit from 3 huge security guys that claimed we didn't want to pay the bill, they were talking about jail. Completely overreacting to a non exciting problem.  . . this is just 3 first hour.. I'm scared.  . . + The internet connection is terrible.. . New York New York NEVER AGAIN!!
Thisplace is awesome!! The room is beautiful and clean! So far all of the staff have been extremely nice and not fake and very helpful. This is definitely our new place we will stay when we come to Vegas!!
Very basic hotel & casino on the end of the strip across the street from MGM.  Good no frills amenities, although I was rather annoyed our room didn't have a fridge.  I wouldn't mind staying here again although I probably won't.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #6:. spoiler alert: it is themed after New York City!; some very cool features including the outdoor faux Brooklyn Bridge along Las Vegas Blvd., the outdoor roller coaster that actually runs right above areas of the casino, and the Greenwich Village area of low key eateries; the hotel check-in is not impressive, basically part of the casino; the entry to the roller coaster is via a huge maze of arcade games - great area for the kiddos, I suppose, but Hades for childless adults; serene & classy conference room area on 2nd floor with cool black & white NYC photos; I must say that Nine Fine Irishmen is the greatest Irish pub west of Manhattan, especially with the house band Sin e Ri Ra kicking it almost every night; best craft beer bet = Pour 24 on the 2nd level has a great selection on tap (please stop ordering Bud Light here, people!), and the Broadway Burger Bar has a fair bit as well
Cash was stolen in my room!!! It was in my wallet inside my purse. Was there for business and our meetings were at the hotel too. Been fighting this with the hotel since June. The investigation is taking forever.. They need to do something and I just want my money back!!! . What's more insulting is they offered a compensation of $50 room service or $50 at Nine Fine Irishmen. No way!!! . I refuse to spend another dime here.
I stay at this hotel A LOT.. Not once or twice but probably 6 times a year... This visit was awful.  A big hair in my jacuzzi tub,  a big greasy handprint on the mirror and clothes tags in the carpet.   Just a nasty room.  I photographed all to prove I am not making this up.
Worst FUCKING HOTEL EVER! We paid 1500+ dollars for the weekend PENTHOUSE! They tried giving us a crappy ass fucking suite! Really? What the fuck is wrong with you guys! Trying to fool us into giving us a crappier room thinking we wouldn't notice? It's my cousins BACHELOR PARTY and you guys try to screw us over like this? Are you kidding me? NEVER COMING BACK HERE, DO NOT COME HERE! THERE SERVICE IS REALLY REALLY BAD! IF I COULD GIVE A LOWER RATING I WOULD
We stopped at the NYNY hotel casino on a long road trip and thought it would be one of the more child friendly hotels on the strip since we were traveling as a family.. . One of the restaurants there, Chin Chin was very good. The sushi, chicken lo mein, and breakfast buffet are amazingly good. There is a big arcade but my very tall 7 year old was too short to ride the roller coaster, which is one of the reasons we wanted to stay there. The pool lights up at night so my son enjoyed that. Unfortunately the internet did not work in our room which created a bunch of problems for us. We called tech support and they woke us up with a knock at the door 2 hours after calling the front desk only to tell us there was nothing they could do.  I hear that this resort will be building a central park themed amusement park soon. That seems like it would be really fun. We enjoyed the new Hershey World and cute NY theme throughout.. . Bottom line: The NYNY hotel is affordable for the strip, is in a good location, and is within walking distance of a lot of fun attractions but next time I would choose a middle of the strip hotel like the Mirage or the Flamingo with kids. The hotel served its purpose and we would return.. . Pros: Price is affordable, Free Parking, Chin Chin breakfast buffet (yum), cute theme. . Cons: Not as child friendly as say The Excaliber or Circus Circus, internet didn't work in our room, housekeeping left a roll away bed in the middle of our room.
So far so good. Nothing that is a wow factor right now.  I would suggest Hershey world. It is a cool place to visit.
I must admit I am a bit of a hotel snob. For those traveling on a bit of a budget this place is great. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. This hotel seemed to be catered to the party-crowd but was at least quiet at night while trying to sleep. There are lots of restaurants and dining options.
Overall, an average hotel experience for the strip. . . Pros: It was clean, everything worked, spacious room (Madison Park Deluxe). Casino was eventful and staff was friendly. Centrally located on the strip. . . Cons: Pool seemed small, so we decided to not venture down there. View was all concrete (expected for a lower end room). Bedding was a little shabby (they used a flat sheet to cover the mattress, not a fitted sheet, and then the sheet had holes in it). Lots of hidden fees. What started out as a $80 room ended up being $120. . . Basically, it served it's purpose. Viva Las Vegas!
So know we have stayed at several hotels here in vegas on the strip and I gotta tell you NYNY is still my top choice!! . . Every year I check in to VIP and is greeted with a smile from the same person that always recognized us from the year before. She makes everything so easy and comfy for us. . . The vibe in the casino at night is always nice. Nothing fancy, just good people having a great time, good music, good bar's and quick server's bringing free drinks as you play. Nocomplaints here
This review is about the arcade. I'm sure most people wouldn't  mind it, but I'm so disappointed that they changed everything. The arcade was a place my dad took me to since I was a kid, and we had so much fun. I went a couple times as an adult and remembered why I loved it so much so we started making it a regularly visited place again. Then we go today and they changed everything to a new system where you use a card for everything. I can definitely see the positives to this system but now they have removed several games including my favorite one. Also, we something was wrong with their system and we lost out on several hundred tickets. . . These things probably don't matter to a lot of people, but for me, because of the changes, this is no longer a place I will be visiting anymore. :( . . On another note, Nine Fine Irishmen is a pretty good restaurant.
