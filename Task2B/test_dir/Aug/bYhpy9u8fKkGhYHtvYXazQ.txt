Enjoyed our stay here.  The beds are fabulous and that is the most important thing to me.  The bathrooms could use updating, but were okay.  The pool is beautiful and the view from the rooms is lovely. We were in 1715.  Overall, a great stay. Good value for the money if you get a good "deal" on it.
This place is in a fantastic location. The parking garage always has a decent spot available too.. The pool was nice and we never had trouble finding a spot to lay out.. There are lots of machines and plenty of restaurants and bars.. . The bathroom is gorgeous and large.. . I give this place three stars because the beds were awful. Also, my pillow smelled like mildew. There were also stains on the sheets. . Even though the beds weren't comfortable I would come here again.
Pricey for the type of hotel but sweet Jesus the bed was like a cloud.   Slept off many a hangover.  Room service was also pricey but super quick and quite yummy.   Enjoyed the dueling piano show downstairs and the mimosas near the elevators are a great way to start your morning ;-)  great location.
Un excelente hotel. Gran ubicacion y limpieza. Buena relacion costo-calidad. Falta wifi libre.
Non, non et re-non.. En tant que bonne parisienne qui se respecte, je peux decemment pas dire que cet hotel est representatif de la capitale. Pourtant c'est dommage ca partait bien.... . L'exterieur est tres bien fait je trouve. On a une jolie Tour Eiffel, et surtout un Arc de Triomphe superbement reproduit. L'opera Garnier, lui, est moyennement similaire a notre magnifique edifice mais bon, je trouvais que de l'exterieur, c'etait assez beau. Ca laisse presager le meilleur. Surtout quand on voit ce qui a ete fait pour le Venetian, on se dit : ouah! Ca doit etre trop beau.. . Et en fait, non pas du tout. On est trop dans le cliche et la caricature, et si j'ai bien retrouve l'esprit de Venise au Venetian, je n'ai absolument pas retrouve le charme parisien au Paris. J'ai trouve ca tout much, trop colore, trop tout en fait. . . Un de mes amis y a pris une chambre et m'a dit que ce n'etait vraiment pas terrible. Du coup prochain passage a Vegas, je me contenterai de regarder l'exterieur et preserver mon temps pour partir vers d'autres decouvertes.
At the paris the atmosphere is very friendly and clean there are many different restaurants and shops. The room were cleaned very well. Comfortable beds and Beautiful bathroom with separate shower and bath. I enjoyed my stay and this is by far my favorite hotel in vegs.
Looks great on the outside. Interior is okay. Girls dance on the casino table at night
The hotel is in the middle of the strip, which is in a nice location. The hotel is beautiful, but the price vs service do not seem to go hand in hand.. . We checked in around 4:30PM and waited about 20 minutes in line...only 3 people working the front desk. While not necessary to have all hands on deck all day, it would be nice during peak times. . . I had requested 1 king bed and they gave us a room with 2 queens. When we entered the room the carpets were wet, there appeared to be vomit stains on the floor, and there was a large commercial fan blowing in attempts to dry the floor. I have pretty severe asthma and allergies, so we had to go back down and request another room. Carrie at the front desk was very apologetic and helpful, and even noticed we had requested a room with a king sized bed and changed that as well. When we got to the room, the toilet paper holder was broken off and sitting on the sink, and it was clear housekeeping was aware of it as they had folded the bottom of the roll neatly. The room was clean and we had plenty of room and a little view of the Bellagio fountains. . . The Le Village buffet was subpar with the only decent items being the 2 kinds of Mac n cheese. The meats were fatty and rubbery, so we basically paid $35 for Mac n cheese. We paid $11.99 extra for the unlimited beer and wine, but the Blue Moon tastes skunked so we opted for a refund and had water instead. La Creperie was delicious - I got the Nutella crepe - but the line was long and the gentleman working did not seem happy to be there. The pool was nice and not too crowded on a Saturday, plenty of room in the water and lounge chairs available. . . Overall, the hotel wasn't necessarily bad, butat a price more expensive than other hotels nearby, I would expect them to step it up a little bit. It was just...ok.
Wow this hotel is very luxurious. Definitely would stay here again.. . I stayed with my friend that had comps. We stayed in the red view rooms overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Awesome room. Super big and comfy beds, giant tv, bathroom was by big with double sinks, private shower, jet tub. Room service was fast and actually pretty cheap.. . Casino is very big and surprisingly lots of table options. Cocktail hosts were on it, every 10_15 mins I got a new cocktail, I got a ill typsy off of free drinks which is always a plus in my book, decor in the casino is very old school romantic Paris which kind of sets this casino apart from others.. . I would stay here again. Awesome hotel and casino.
Paris Las Vegas is a nice hotel. The staff is friendly and willing to answer questions when needed. I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights (aug 4- aug 6). I checked-in around 1:30 pm and was not charged a early check-in fee YAY & even got a Las Vegas strip view room. My only issue was the $100 registration fee that I was not told about and the $44 fee for internet that is automatic (even tho I did not use the internet) Overall I would stay here again.
I really enjoyed my stay. The staff is excellent and amazing. It's not as fancy as other places because it tries to portray an older look? (Not sure) . . The casino is awesome with different variety of slots and games. . . Definitely a nice memory of my first time visiting Las Vegas. . . The room was clean and like I mentioned before, it had an older look to it. The tv was off to the side so that was kind of weird.  There's a big closet/drawer thing where you would imagine the tv being but instead there's a refrigerator there. . . I didn't get a chance to visit the Eiffel Tower for viewing or the restaurant but hopefully next time!
Pretty bummed out about this place, the view we got was amazing however the tv would not work at all and the wired internet was broken as well as the sink being clogged, called the front desk and Ashley told me they could move me but to the other side of the hotel with no view and several floors below (about 22) & that was pretty much my only options. Decided to just stay since I would just check out in the am and head to a different hotel doubt I'll be staying here again or recommending it to anyone. The view was awesome but the customer service is clearly lacking.
Nice chill hotel. I don't think it's big enough. Or maybe it was way too crowded. Cool piano lounge downstairs. Also good pastries restaurant downstairs. Pool was ok for the fam. Gym was ok fairly small. Center of Las Vegas strip. Room was nice. I just wasn't impressed. I think I expected more. Not that it was bad in any way. Would come back.
We have stayed at many properties and we find Paris to be our favorite. The reason? The buffet is good, the nightlife is exciting, The Sugar Factory is fun, Gaming is good with fine variety. Staff is mixed but in Paris it would be much worse. You simply have to try a bit of everything here. We love playing at Bally's best and that is just a short walk through the casino without having to go outside. The only bad thing is the Anthony Cools show, we hated it but others love it. It just felt fake. . . Make sure you take the time to walk through the Arc De Triumph (near the balloon) and take the Eiffel Tower ride. The view is incredible. Just don't go when it is very windy. . . The best reason for five stars, location is everything. Directly across from Bellagio and a short distance to all of the best places including Caesars Palace, The Quad and High Roller, Flamingo, Bally's, Planet Hollywood, and the Cosmopolitan. Save your feet by staying here center strip.
My husband I stayed here August 10-14. I thought the hotel was nice, although not nearly as grand as I had imagined. The rooms were decent enough...I say rooms because we had to switch rooms after our second morning there. Monday morning we were woken up at 7:00am by construction a few floors up, and at 7:30 the next day. The manager assured us it would be finished Monday, but it wasn't. Pissed off to no end about getting woken up so damn early while on vacation. They moved us from the 4th floor to the 27th, where at least our view of the parking lot was improved thanks to fact that we were 23 floors higher and could now see the lights on the strip. They told us the new room was a suite, when in fact it was the same exact room we had before, just with different decor and a coffee machine. . The Sugar Factory serves delicious pizza and drinks. Be sure to try the Recess Peanut Butter martini. Also the fancy burger restaraunt in the hotel was very good and provided a few vegetarian options.. . The pool was a big disappointment for me, as it was ice cold. No matter how hot it is outside, who the hell wants to go into an ice cold pool? And by the looks of others, I was not alone. Are they so cheap that they cannot heat it just a little? The Jacuzzis were nice though. . . I would stay at this hotel again, but it isn't my first choice, as there are few others I would love to try out.
This place is really nice. I personally think it's decorated beautifully.  We have awesome service.  We are in a suite on the 21st floor. I like the view even though it's not of the strip or of the tower. Our suite is really nice. My husband and i think the bed is very comfortable.
The rooms are decent; nothing fancy at all. We booked Paris for a pretty good price, so I didn't expect anything extravagant anyways. The pool on the other hand was a pretty sweet treat. It's HUGE! This means that there's room for everyone and then some. Also, the dj playing music by the pool added to the Las Vegas party vibe. Now on to my favorite part! The pool is located right next to the Eiffel Tower so seeing it up close was pretty grand. It's the perfect backdrop to a nice Vegas hotel pool relaxation time. . . If the price is right, I'd book again!
I went there just the other day with my friend, Alejandra for the sole purpose of visiting their Eiffel Tower back on Monday, August 18, 2014 and it was a Very Pleasurable Experience!. . I have been to Las Vegas several times before, but I never knew that you could go up the Eiffel Tower because I thought that it was only a Free Standing Monument.. . However, this time around I got very curious and went inside the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino to find out if I could possibly go up the Eiffel Tower and sure enough it happened!. . It was very beautiful and had Fantastic Views of the City!. . I more than Highly Recommend this place to Catch a Glimpse of the City!. . Thank you for Making our Visit a Very Memorable One!. . Enjoy To The Fullest!
Gross! Gross! Gross!. . Hair in the shower and bathtub, red stains in the carpet, and bad bad water pressure. I felt like I was camping. If it weren't for the hotels great casino vibe, restaurants, and gaming I would've given it one star.
I heard good and bad stuff about Paris Hotel & Casino.  I was there for Weds and Thursday this week.  My feeling is that Paris is a good hotel and there service was good.  Paris Hotel is not a huge Hotel & Casino but still big enough .  Next time when you are in Vegas go check out Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.
The rooms are nice and comfortable.  The location is great.  The pool is nice but there is not enough shade by early afternoon.  Free coffee in the room is nice.  We have stayed here numerous times and is always a nice experience.
I like the Eiffel Tower and Arc du Triumph in front.  Except they're all mashed up and give the place a claustrophobic effect.  Also, what's up with the crazy "sky" thing inside?  Kinda weird.
Totally disappointed.Rooms are super small and old.The tv is in the corner of the room making it hard to see from the bed. Hot water takes 5 minutes to heat up. I feel like I'm staying at a Best Western. I will never stay here again. I've stayed in Vegas several times,you can get a way better room for the same amount of money (with a view!!!!) somewhere else. Don't waste you money here.
Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower ride, in Paris Hotel, 20 dollars for the ticket, I would suggest night time take in Vegas at night. No time limit you can stay as long as u want.
The pros:. -Great location (right on the strip in the center of the action).. -Good ambiance and theme (it's a little on the cheesy side, but this is what you should expect in Vegas). -Friendly staff at the bars and restaurant (albeit a little slow). . The cons:. -The check-in process is a mess.  I "checked in" early via email, which somehow made it more difficult to check in in person.. -The layout/numbering of the rooms is entirely illogical. -The dealers and cashiers on the casino floor are a bit rude
Don't ever stay here!  The casino is very small!  You pay a resort free...for what?  Wifi is included.  However, it took me 25 minutes just to get yelp.  This place is a dump.  I stayed here twice and I should have learn after the first, but I think to give a place a second chance.  Btw...when you're room key stops working you have to wait in a 45 MINUTE line just to reactive it...I talked to 5, that's FIVE different hotel workers.  I there my players hard out and I won't stay at any of these hotels.  Back to aria where is was 110%. Big mistake here
LOVED LOVED LOVED everything about this place.. . It's in the perfect location, the service is just AWESOME! I've stayed at Harrah's and Planet Hollywood and this one is the best out of the 3. The rooms are amazing and they are CLEAN! Checking in was a piece of cake, but the check out line was pretty long. However, I don't mind that at all!. . I really don't mind paying a bit extra just to stay at Paris, they have good food, Chateau is a good club, and Mike (he's a dealer there) made spending my money at the tables way too much fun! LOL. . RECOMMEND!
