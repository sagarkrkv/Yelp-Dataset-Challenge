Stayed here for my trip in July.  Booked my room online for about $300 for 5 nights.  When we checked in around 7pm, it was pretty quick.  The checkout counter was very near to the taxi drop off.  I almost forgot about the free buffet credit that came with the hotel booking, but the receptionist was kind to remind me and let me know how to redeem it.  . . The rooms were better than what I expected after reading reviews online. It's not the most luxurious, but worth what I paid for.  The only minor gripes off the bat were that I had to plug the bed light and turn on the main power switch for the TV. This would've been more of an inconvenience for a non-techie.  The resort fee included coffee (1 cup coffee maker using packaged grounds), wired internet (wireless was spotty on the 17th floor, but they only guaranteed connection on floors 1 and 2) and 2 mini bottles of water.  The beds werecomfortable and soft. Our room was facing the pool side.  I didn't think the noise level was distracting, but others not used to it might not enjoy it.  It was only on during early afternoon to sunset. Other reviews said the walls were thin, but I couldn't hear any of my neighbors.  Bathroom was a good size.  Fixtures could use an update soon though.  I thought the shower faucet was leaky at first, but I just had to turn it tight.. . One of the reasons I chose the hotel was its central location.  New York New York was less than 5 minutes walking distance away.  There is a free monorail past the shops that stopped by Crystals Center and Bellagio.  The temperature at that time was between 100-110 degrees, so this helped a lot and saved us money that we normally would use on the bus or taxi. There is a good selection of places to eat here.  New places opened up in the front area facing the strip.. . The casino itself was one of the smaller ones on the strip I've been to other than Bally's. The only slots I really play are Wheel of Fortune which are conveniently placed by the room elevators and buffet. The Pai Gow dealer Fernando was very friendly to chat with.  Drink service was excellent all around, especially at the tables and Wheel of Fortune areas.
Enjoyed our stay here. Rooms are pretty standard. Nothing fancy, but nothing horrible either. My sister in laws room was pretty dirty upon arrival, but ours was fine. Worst part was no wifi above the second floor!!! They have an Ethernet cord but that didn't help with our iPhones and iPads! Pool was nice. The area right by entrance was fully shaded in the morning which was perfect for letting my infant swim for a short time. Wave pool and lazy river were nice also. The food court is convenient. The buffet was horrible!!  Friendly staff. I would stay here again if I wanted something not too expensive.
ATTN: Kim T.. . We'll I made it to Monte Carlo !! Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to the VIP check in due to the traffic coming from LA. ..  But not the less. I checked in, lady at from was very nice. .. Thank you for the room "upgrade". I really see no difference other then The view and the broken lampshades. We'll here is what I see so far.  The water in the shower comes out. Very lightly with no pressure ( not as I remember it). And. Also the. Drain seem to be. Backed up that the water take some time to drain ...  The lamp shades are all broken and dirty  ill attaches picture...  But. I have to say not what I expected. ..  I would have to say the Monte Carlo to me has loss it's edge and forget the basics I would have to say that this might be the last time I visit any the the MGM resorts. It's sad to say.  I really had higher standards for Monte Carlo. Maybe not as high as your other properties but some what better. ...  We'll if you would. Like my feedback or speak over the phone then  my number is on my room reservation if not it was a pleasure. I will be posting. This on my social media feeds as we'll in the days to come. Including the pictures.  . . Regards. . . J. Oliver
Let me first say that I normally do not stay on the strip or anywhere near here. I'm a Golden Nugget type of person. The younger crowd that hang out in these strip casinos are full of douchey people that all think they are high rollers when in fact they are all spending their paychecks and savings accounts trying to fit in paying for over priced bottles of wine and terrible service. So this particular trip we were looking for somewhere that had a cool pool because we had the kids with us. Note: kids don't belong in Vegas it's boring for them here. We were just passing thru coming home from vacation. So looking at who had cool pools we would of normally stayed at the MGM. But we wanted to try somewhere new. DUM DUM DUUM! This place is over crowded and over priced. Their rooms are terrible! I literally called the front desk because I said I wanted 2 queens but the queen are more like twin beds. They are SMALL! Very small for a queens. And I have been in better rooms at the Plaza for less than half the price. Bathroom was plain and small. The rooms are very small as well. Just to put it plainly, I WAS NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL! You here about these places on the strip. Yes, the casino was nice. But the other place like the rooms and the pool were just not up to par at all for the price. Big thumbs down for the price. Be happy you got 2 stars. Will never stay here again I don't think.
There are nicer hotels for the same prices. I always thought Monte Carlo was higher class, UNTIL I STAYED THERE. Stained & wrinkled carpets, chipped bathroom decor, etc. I stayed for the pools, but the lazy river is very small & the wave pool gives off tiny waves, not even a tad fun. Not staying here again.
My fiance and I stayed at the Monte Carlo this weekend. After looking at some of the negative reviews I was thinking we would have to change hotels, but when we arrived we found the staff to be friendly and helpful, the entire hotel and room to be spotless, and our overall experience was great! Pool party was kinda loud during the day but who is in their room during the day? The spa was great (too expensive though, I've never paid so much for a facial). Granted the hotel is older and the floors and fixtures are gold finish like it's 1975 but the chipped floors were shined beyond belief and the place was well maintained. The only negative we had was a weird shower head, it kind of sprayed at you like it was the police and you were a protester - a little too forceful and sort of all over the place.
So I received a call from M.C. Today ..  Very nice phone call to apologize for the experience.  Have to say it does. Make a big difference. I have to say I enjoy the Monte Carlo more than any Casino .  Reason being the location and we'll the cost. My review. Was  based on my current visit.  I have been staying at the MC for the past 8 years. That I starting going to Vegas. ..  This mornings phone. Call really cleared the air..  Monte Carlo you have a wonderful team working. Your customer experience. . .   Thank you . Kim T. for the phone call. See you in the Fall
The valet/ Bell desk guy was superb.  Went to go grab our bags and met us at the taxi stand and loaded them in.. . Expedia did not have some things right with the reservations.  Front desk Manager Jake was extremely helpful.  Made a bad first impression into a very good one.. . If you want to get a lounge chair at the pool get their early!  Very nice tho.. . Waitresses girls for the casino are on top of their game never had to wait for a drink.. . Strip view room was nice.  We were on the 30th floor rm313. . Over all a good stay!
We have stayed here many times but our last visit on July 19 was horrible. We found both beds had dirty bloody sheets after inspecting sheets in the am. We were ready to leave but our kids begged to stay because they love the pool and friends staying at the hotel. We got a room exchange, $50.00 food credit and one night comp. Still disgusted knowing my kids and I slept in bloody sheets.
Clean, good service, and cool lazy river. I stayed in a suite and it was wonderful with a great pool view. Valet and concierge services were helpful and prompt. The food court had good options and their Chinese restaurant was not bad. I just wish the Japanese sushi restaurant would open for lunch hours. I didn't have time to see a show or visit higher end restaurants, so I can't comment. The gym was okay, nothing special.
Let me start off and say that the concierge at Monte Carlo was amazing! They are very service-oriented and made me feel like my patronage was appreciated.. . The rooms were as expected- nice, without being overly luxurious or anything. However, the bathrooms were so subpar. What kind of a 4-star hotel bathroom only has 1 dim light? At least the light was over the sink, so I could apply my makeup properly. However, the tiny tub with the shower curtain was so dark, that I could barely see in the shower. The water pressure in the shower was also pretty terrible, and the water felt like a light drizzle. It also took forever and a day for the shower to get hot. I think it was 10minutes into my shower that I finally felt the water reach a comfortable temperature. I had it on the hottest possible, and didn't need to turn it down at all during my 20 minute shower. . . Wifi is only complimentary in the lobby and public areas, and guests have to pay for wifi in their rooms. . . The pool was awesome, and we really enjoyed the lazy river (inner tube rentals at a fee). We didn't get to the wave pool, but everyone seemed to really enjoy that as well. We managed to squeeze into the jacuzzi with about 8 other people. . . The concierge was very helpful in booking Blue Man Group tickets for us a few hours before the show. We got discounts on seats towards the front of the theater, thanks to our m-life membership. . . The checkout process was very efficient and simple, thanks to their check out computer kiosks. And they were more than happy to hold our bags for us until our flight in the evening. . . I'm not exactly sure if I would stay in the Monte Carlo again because of the bathrooms. Although the rest of our experience there was amazing, a dark bathroom with measly tepid water is a huge bummer.
If you are on a tight budget - the Monte Carlo is probably one of the better bargains on the strip. From our stay it seems to be popular with overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians. And luckily for me at their gym - seems neither of those groups work out!. . Given my recent experience though - I will probably spend a few more bucks next trip and stay at Vdara or similar (discount rates via Jetsetter/Hotels etc). I knocked thisfrom 3 to 2 stars for uncleanliness. Details follow..... . The Dirty Discoveries:. . - Bathroom floor: dirty, especially under the sink. I mentioned once to room service, but it was never mopped. I rubbed around a towel to verify it was dirty, and not just the color of the floor. - Dirty Washcloth: the second day I was delivered a washcloth with multiple large, bright red stains in it, that looked like fresh blood. Made me think they don't bleach their towels enough. Unfortunately it was right on top of other towels on the rack. Those all went on the floor, unused.. - Found half a condom wrapper under the desk, in the far corner of the room, next to the wall (thankfully, no condom, and unfortunately too small sized for me anyway). - Found a pill on the floor, next to the bed, while checking around to see what other goodies we might find. Googled it and it was a birth control pill, and not one that any of my girlfriends' take. And, unfortunately, of no use to me (being male).. . Previous guest - whoever you were - when you leave pills behind - please leave me some of The Good Shit. Thanks.. . We ended up leaving the wrapper and pill on the floor, to see if it would get cleaned up. They were there our entire stay, until checkout. To be fair - we didn't call room service and tell them about it. But, I wanted to gauge how often/well the floors were cleaned before I performed any calisthenics on the floor. Needless to say we decided it was better off to wear socks and avoid touching the floors.. . Overall I thought it was kind of funny, minus the bloody washcloth, but my girlfriends' were fairly unimpressed. I've stayed all over Vegas, and in this price range the MGM Grand was similar but cleaner. But that was 9 years ago.. . In Summary -. . Pros:. + cheap. (I paid roughly $115/night for 5 days = $585 total. I've read other folks found 5 night bargains for as low as $300. For $300 I'd give this place 3-4 stars). + No taxi line, ever, even peak evening times.. + Beds were decent for a cheap stay.. + Great, free gym, very clean, new equipment, that nobody uses. Very friendly and helpful gym/spa staff. The gym alone would be a deciding factor in staying here again, were the rooms clean.. . Cons:. - Hallways to room were worn down, dirty. - Room was very dirty - see above.. - Checkin lines looked insane most of the time I walked by. Luckily when I arrived (on a Tuesday) it was fairly dead. I waited maybe 15 minutes total. Later in the week looked light it might be painfully long in line.. - Only tried eating at "The Buffet". Food was overall very low quality, in all of my guests opinions, for $25/apiece. I'm more of a quality than quantity guy, but we wanted breakfast food.. . ProTip: Didn't try their other restaurants, but we found out we could have eaten at The Buffet for roughly $10/person by calling Tix4Tonight.
Planned a quick trip for my mother in laws birthday so we had to book a room fast. My mom has stayed at the Monte Carlo years ago and she loved it. So we decided to stay here since all the other hotels were booked. We get to the hotel and wanted to see if we could get the same floor to my sister in laws room since she as well was staying at the hotel. They told us that was possible but our room wouldn't be ready until FIVE PM.. Mind you it was ELEVEN AM. No way would we wait that long so we decided to just get another room in any floor. BIGGEST MISTAKE! The front desk told us we would get a strip view for the inconvenience on the 9th floor. We were excited to go check out the room and when we go in the view of the strip was non existen we had a wonderful view of the roof of the top of the casino.. 1 star down... . I tried to be open minded and not let that bother me.. But then I go use the restroom and the door gets jammed! I yelled for my mother in law to go help me open it because I was literally stuck inside the bathroom. It took about 5 mins to finally be able to open it . She had to push the door open with her whole body..Another star down... . We go down to the pool to tan and relax for a bit. They do have a small pool and even smaller jacuzzi.  A lazy river. And a wave pool. We walked around and it was beyond crowded you had to search for any empty chairs. The water was so nasty and hazy . I didn't dare to even go into the pool!. . Bathroom lighting is horrible and the toilet flushing is so loud.. So night time rolls around and it's time for us to shower and get ready so I let my mother in law shower first. When she's done showering she tells me I might have to wait to shower because the tub is full of water.. The drainage was so bad it took forever for the water to go down. So we ran late to dinner because of this . Minus another star.. . The pillows are not comfortable at all! They are so hard I even had to sleep with no pillows since it was unbearable.  On the other side of my bed there was also a big wet stain. Of course I didn't realize it until I stepped on it with my bare feet. I will never know what that was... . At this point I wish yelp had an option to put zero stars.. I won't ever be staying here again. If everything wasn't so crammed in together I would've been able to complain but by then I just wanted to hurry up and self check out and never stay in this nightmare or a hotel again. If your running on a budget there are plenty of inexpensive hotels on the strip. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY STAYING HERE.
I come to Vegas 2-3 times a year and this is one if my favourite hotels! I have always been treated so wonderful there. Sure some. Times the lines are long but what do you expect when they literarily have 1000's of people coming to this hotel and Vegas-the pools are nice and the shopping and entertainment is great! The beds and pillows are the best :) I always have one lazy day while I'm here in Vegas and just stay in my room lounging around :) - This hotel is definitely worth the stay :)
After a terrible afternoon which included a flight cancellation and the need to book a room on a Saturday at the last minute we ended up here.  I had stayed here years before and the place is definitely worse for the wear.  The first room they gave us was not clean, in a few disturbing ways, leading me to change rooms for the first time in my life.  The second room, on the 28th floor, was better, but still not four star quality.  The staff was nice, and the casino is solid and has reasonable limits, but the rooms are more three star than four and I would hesitate to stay here again without a big room renovation and assurance the cleaning staff was doing a better job.
Looking up from the lazy river and wave pool at the Monte Carlo. Get your dance, tan, and drink on!
First off, listen, if you are going to give the hotel 2 stars and say you'll stay at Bellagio next time, that is not helpful! That is comparing apples to oranges. Of COURSE Bellago is nicer, it costs 2-4 times as much.  That's like saying Denny's sucks because Lawry's has way better food.  You need to re-align your expectations if you are expecting the Bellagio when you stay at Monte Carlo. If you are looking for the 20-something wild club scene, this is also not the hotel for you. Do some research.  . . Now, that said, for the price it is great. I have been staying here exclusively for 3 years ever since my last nightmare stay at a TR property, and I have been very happy. Yes, things go wrong, but this is a huge hotel with thousands of guests moving through everyday. Cut them some slack. You are human too. . . I don't know why everyone is complaining about wi-fi not working in the rooms. They don't even OFFER free wi-fi in the rooms. Only the first floor, though I have stayed as high as 8th and got it to work. They offer free wired internet in the rooms, but no wi-fi.  . . I have never found rooms to be dirty. Worn, yes, in need of updating, maybe. But filthy? No. The water pressure is a problem at every huge high rise hotel in Vegas, and everywhere else I have ever stayed in one. . . The pool is our absolute favorite of any Las Vegas hotel. Other than the one day it has a pounding DJ and wet bikini contests, it is a mellow, quiet, safe-feeling atmosphere. I love the lazy river and the wave pool, and I have never had a problem getting a chair in the sun or shade.  Wait service is good if you treat them well, and the only one time I saw any misbehavior security was on TOP of it big time (it was just someone who had way too much to drink and was endangering herself by being in the pool, nothing big).  I think this hotel does tend to attract families because of the pool as there are always kids in it, but I have never felt like it was overrun with kids, nor an inappropriate environment for when I do have my kids with me (which is rare). . . Admittedly, we don't eat on-property much, we tend to go to other resorts for dining but not because there is anything wrong with MC's food, we just try to brand out and try new things and MC has not had the widest array of choices. Now there are more with the new openings so we may have to try Yusho on our trip this month. . . Valet has always been fast and we use it every time we stay. I like to park once and cab/walk for the whole trip so we don't have to worry about drinking. I also have used the new express/early VIP check-in and it was great. One room of our two was ready by 10am, the other wasn't but they quickly found one that was and we were on our way to the pool less than 20 minutes later. Yes, the line for check-in is long at 3pm on a Friday - it moves very fast and you should see the line at Bellagio if you want to compare! Yikes!! . . On our last two trips this year, the casino air was the cleanest it has even been. I did not need my asthma meds once, and not one time did I end up at table with anyone smoking. The air actually seemed pretty darned clean for a casino. . . One thing I really do like about Monte Carlo is that it is not enormous and the elevators to the rooms are placed very close to check-in and valet/parking as well as the pool and the tram to Bellagio. I hate nothing more than having to walk half a mile just to get to my room, through a crowded casino, carrying luggage. . . Monte Carlo is also a good less expensive place to stay if you don't plan on spending any time in your room but just want an inexpensive, quiet, convenient place to crash, hit the spa and relax at the pool, while you do your partying elsewhere.. . As for the comment about only "overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians" staying here, that is disgusting and wrong. You've clearly never been to the pool mid-day. Yes, it is a quieter hotel, not a party scene, but that comment is really ugly. Sheesh!
KID City not SIN City...Short Stay type of Motel Rooms not Hotel Rooms.. . The room reserved for me was outdated with stained and dirty chairs, stained carpeting throughout (I couldn't sit or even take off my shoes) peeling walls, no mini fridge, plus I got a view of their HVAC system. They graciously changed my room it was approximately 20 percent better, but I still wouldn't wouldn't sit on the chairs or walk bare foot.. . The chaise lounges at the pools are also dirty and stained. You have to climb in it because there is no room on either side of the lounges. They are one on top of the other. The towels at the pool had either yellow stains, holes, shredding at the edges or all of the above.. . If you want to relax by the pool or in the jacuzzi is not going to happen. Infants and Children galore. So expect a lot of pee pee going on in the water.. . Even though it is modestly priced. It still wasn't worth the money. . . Staff are friendly and professional. . A serious upgrade is an extreme necessity. . . Gravely DISSATISFIED!!!
I usually stay at the Monte Carlo. I like the location and it's easy to find your way around.  I'm not giving up on the Monte Carlo just yet but they have some issues with maintenance and housekeeping.  The carpets are dirty and the bathroom has issues that would make Bob Vila crap his pants. That said, none of these issues were bad enough to repack my clothes and ask for another room. It's Vegas who stays in their room for a long
One of our family favorites hotel and casino. Friendly staff, well kept rooms and the pools are fabulous. Lazy river is our favorite.  Center of the strip and easy access to many shops. Had a great time and will continue to book here.
So I received a call from M.C. Today ..  Very nice phone call to apologize for the experience.  Have to say it does. Make a big difference. I have to say I enjoy the Monte Carlo more than any Casino .  Reason being the location and we'll the cost. My review. Was  based on my current visit.  I have been staying at the MC for the past 8 years. That I starting going to Vegas. ..  This mornings phone. Call really cleared the air..  Monte Carlo you have a wonderful team working. Your customer experience. . .   Thank you . Kim T. for the phone call. See you in the Fall.
My gf and I recently stayed at the Monte Carlo for four days in the Monaco Suite. I was really looking forward to this trip b/c it was a gathering of cousins.. . We started by going to happy hour in the afternoon at The Cafe. I ordered Chicken Tikka. About 2.5 hours later, I started to break out in sweats and had to go to the bathroom multiple times. It kept me sick throughout the night including my dinner at a Brazilian steakhouse with the group of 15. I totally didn't get my money's worth b/c I had only two plates before having to go back to my room.. . I thought about all the things I ate and drink up until that point and I could not find any other explanation except for that Chicken Tikka. DO NOT ORDER IT!. . After several hours of napping back in the room, I tried to get settled in and take out my luggage. That's when we found a number of problems. There was a bottle of KY Jelly in the drawer next to the bed, a bunch of trash in the drawer under the TV and the bathroom faucet was full of gunk.. . I took photos of all three items and went to Guest Services to complain. The gentleman listened to my complaints and saw the pictures I took. He apologized and gave me a $50 credit and said he would get me another room that's equal or higher. I said since it's already 12am, I can wait until the morning. He said okay and someone will call me between 12pm and 5pm tomorrow.. . The next day, we went for lunch and put the privacy card on the door. I still haven't received a phone call after 2pm So we went back to guest services to check the status.The gentleman told me that it looked like we are downgrading to another room. I was extremely frustrated and upset so I explained the whole situation to him. He had to get a manager (CeCe) to get me an upgrade. Cece comes and said there's nothing for me. I explained my situation again, showed her the pictures and then she had a change of mind. She gave me an upgrade and said someone will come up with room keys for me to a new room.. . When we returned to the room, we realized the privacy card was gone from the door. Someone came in and cleaned our room. What the heck! So we got our keys a bit later and moved everything into the new room.. . The new room was the Diamond Suite on the 18th floor. So we walk in and after a few steps,I stepped on a Cheeto on the floor. Then we found a pair of jeans in the bedroom, the shower handle was full of gunk and some of the lights did not work. Despite all of that, we were willing to deal with it b/c at least there's no KY Jelly in the drawer. We started to unpack and I realized that my cigar cutter is gone. It was sitting on the table in my previous room. I'm pretty sure housekeeping took it.. . The new room also didn't have a privacy card or an in-dining menu. I had to write a note on a piece of paper and stick it outside of my door for "DO NOT DISTURB." . . This was the most frustrating stay I've ever had in Vegas. Besides the location of the Monte Carlo, there is nothing to like about this place. It was dirty, I had my stuff stolen, my room was cleaned despite the privacy card and I got food poisoning from their food. I would not recommend anyone to stay here for all of the reasons above. If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend the extra money to stay elsewhere. It's not worth saving the few bucks per night.
Never again! We just checked into out room.  It wasn't very clean, few things looked broken or used. We were only staying two days, so it fine I guess. We went down to the casino to walk around and see what's going on, it was pretty dead in there. 30 mins later we went back to our room, to find our hallway Flooded with about of inch of nasty smelling water! Joking about our room being flooded,  to find out it was our room! Our door was open with staff all standing around blocking our door way, pushing them out of the way. I guess the toilet tank over flowed while we were gone. Our luggage were left in a puddle of nasty water! The staff didn't bother to move anything! We had to call a manager ourselves. They were too busy trying to mop of the flood. The they said a Manger would not come up to our room,  they don't do that. All they were going to do was move us to another room! Turns out after yelling at everyone the manager showed up with security!  We got moved to a worse room with view of construction,  we said hell no, got moved again. They wanted us to do some BS checks and other stuff, we only came back to our room to get ready and leave for a show. I was bothered they never called us to let us know our room was flooded,  nor check on us after we got moved the next day. I would never say here again,  everything looks old and dirty.
After staying here for 4 nights Wed-Sun, I have to say this place isn't half bad. Rooms were expected, not completely luxurious but not your basic hotel room.. . Prices were reasonable for the rooms, I booked two adjoining two queen bed rooms and it still ended up being barely more than just 1 room at a more upscale hotel such as The Mirage or MGM.. . The pool is awesome. Lazy river, wave pool and a volleyball court. Casino isn't crazy big and just the right size. Game options are good, plenty to choose from. They have a food court with a good amount of options. Id avoid it though cause they literally rape you with the prices there. $10 for a $5 subway footlong?! I'll walk a bit more and grab something cheaper and better.. . Location isn't bad either, it's at the beginning/middle of the strip. It's convenient that there's a CVS right in front of the hotel and tons of places to eat within the vicinity.. . Overall if you're on a budget and don't need anything overly luxurious I would recommend this hotel.
We booked our room on Expedia like most people would. Requesting a king bed non smoking. When we checked in the hotel told us that room wasn't available. Instead we would get a double queen bed. They said our reservation on Expedia doesn't guarantee any requests. We complained and got no where. They did t do anything for us. I guess this is pretty standard practice for this hotel. The room was terrible and we demanded a room change. They accommodated us. Still in a room that had two queens. The hotel room is very out dated and looks terrible. Bathrooms looks like you stepped into the 1990's. I will never stay at that place again.
Okay so my boyfriend and I stayed here Tuesday through Thursday. . Valet is EXTREMELY polite and welcoming. . The line was short to check in. . . We got free tickets to the buffet.. Let's just say, good thing it was free.  . . Our room was the Spa Suite. . I loved everything about it. . . The bathroom had it's own separate door for the toilet, which was great.. . The hot tub was HUGE! . I recommend bringing bubbles. It gets really fun. . The hot tub is just next to the window to enjoy a view while having a drink. . They also have little jets inside the hot tub that are so relaxing. . . The couches were uncomfortable--stiff. . . The kitchen was nice. . . The AC is spectacular. It actually really works. . . The food court has a great variety.. [subway, McDonald's, sbarro, Chinese food, rubios, chicken tenders]. . . Monte Carlo, you sure did satisfy our needs. . By far my favorite hotel on the strip now. . . Would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like you should update your lamps to have an outlet to charge your phone. . And also, the bottom sheet under the bed, [the "skirt"] was dirty. Looked like vomit. :/ . . But other than that, I loved it all.
While not the fanciest hoteln on the strip, the MC works hard to provide amenities and location that keep your costs down while in vegas.  The pool offers more options than caesers, venetian or palazzo and you can get a chaise lounge.  Not being able to move the chairs to sun direction is a problem.. . Food court is great, access to food and sundries at cvs, walgreens and abc stores across the street is great. Train is fantastic way to get all the way down to the bellagio free... . Nice little sports book at no fee (hear that Venetian)... . Hip, music on the sidewalk at night.. . One complaint, wireless access in the rooms is woefully behind the times. 4g barely works, most of the your are in E mode. Lets get modern MC, invest in wireless access points for our mobile devices in the rooms..
I always stay at Mlife properties but this was my first time at Monte Carlo! I Loved the cleanliness of the casino  and the location was great! A short indoor walk to Aria and quick tram to the Bellagio ! Right across from the ABC store ! Heaven!!  We ate at Diablos and it was delicious, also the Dragon Noodle restaurant was amazing food ! The only small issue I had was I felt a summer cold coming on and retired to my room early while my husband played some poker. Around 9pm I wanted to order some soup for my sore throat from room service, but they were closed . I guess I was used to the MGM having 24/7 room service.  Nevertheless, it was a great trip, this is my first yelp and I am happy to give a positive review !
I enjoyed staying very much because of the hospitality. The Concierge were very kind and so was the Housekeeping. I complained that the shower was very weak and wasn't draining properly and they fixed it right away. I didn't want the trouble of switching rooms either so they fixed the little mistake. The room was okay, two queen beds, non-smoking. Beds were extremely comfortable and I loved the pillows to the point I wanted to take some but refrained from doing so.. . PROS:. -the beds are awesome. -the people are awesome. -the breakfast at their buffet was pretty good, WAY BETTER than MGM. -they have a little food court right across the lobby which is very convenient. Starbucks too.. -they have a tram connected to the hotel that will take you to aria and bellagio so you won't have to walk all the way over there. . . CONS;. -the pools were way too dinky for my taste. I mean, my brother loved it because he's a kid but i thought the pools were way too close to each other and the space seemed very compact and limited.. . All in all, I would definitely stay here again because I loved every minute of it. It was a nice, relaxing vacation that I thoroughly enjoyed and Monte Carlo Resort made it the best for me. . . WAY BETTER THAN PARIS HOTEL.
Because it was our third time to Vegas in three years for yet another bachelorette we decided we would try something different than our beloved MGM Grand and save a little bit of money.. . Pros- cheap, right on the strip (central), tram goes right to the hotel, lazy river/big pool. . Cons- the rooms were gross! We moved the tv dresser to find an outlet and we found old Parmesan cheese wrappers and food and dust, the lazy river is highly monitored and lots of families- if you are looking for a party pool not the best one as you can't even float the river with a beer! And the showers- old and the water pressure was trickling!. . All in all I probably would not stay here again and would spend a little more- but I guess the sayings true you get what you pay for!
