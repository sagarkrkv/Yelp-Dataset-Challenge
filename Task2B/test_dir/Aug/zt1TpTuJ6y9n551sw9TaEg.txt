I've never been so dissatisfied with service, that the food became an afterthought. I've been to Las Vegas 6 times within the last 3 years and visited here each time. After my last experience here, I'll be taking a long break if I ever decide to go back. . . My father and I ate here on 7/25 for brunch around 11am.  I'd say the capacity was about 2/3rds or less full.  For buffets, I only expect 2 things for service - that my plates are cleared in a timely manner and drinks are refilled. After being seated, I go to get my food first while my father stays behind and orders our drinks.  I'm away a good while since I take a look at all of the food stations to decide where to get started. Decided on some breakfast items and toasted a slice of bread.  When I get back to the table, only our bottle of glass water was dropped off.  For those that haven't been here before, they provide you a bottle of glass water to start you off with.  My father leaves to get his food and our waitress finally arrives with our order of a cup of coffee and two juices.  This was over 10 minutes since we were first seated.  Another note to those that haven't been here before is that the table that seats two is small and the big plates that they use take up about a little less than a quarter of it.  I finish my first plate and my glass of juice, and I go back to get more food.  I tell my dad to order another juice for me while I'm gone. When I came back, my plate wasn't cleared and the waitress didn't stop by to check on us.  In fact, she didn't pass by at all since she came back with the drinks.  My father flagged down the first person that passed by, which just so happens to be the lady that sat us. She mentions that she wasn't our server and calls the one who was down. Lo and behold, our server appeared with the quickness to finally clear my plate and refill my juice.  By this time, our water was less than half full and should have been refilled also. But it never was refilled our whole stay.  By the time our waitress came back, I was halfway done with my second plate.  I always overlook things like this and give our server the benefit of the doubt, but still no improvement.  Our area wasn't even full and I didn't see our server busy serving others except for a group of a dozen ladies with champagne who seemed more into taking selfies and chatting than eating. My third plate was dessert already. And when I came back, my second plate was still on the table! So was my father's first plate.  So remember what I said about the size of the plates and table? Well that equals a full table does it? Our table wasn't cleared until I was already done with dessert.  The thing that really bothered me was we were near the wall where the bussers would stack up cleared plates before taking them to be washed. I was thinking they were shorthanded, but seemed like they had enough time to talk story by the wall while our plates and well as others in our area weren't cleared yet.  Like I said in the beginning, all I expected was my plates to be cleared in a timely manner (preferable before I come back with my next plate) and drinks are refilled.  If my father didn't flag down the lady that sat us, who knows if our server would have ever come back? . . We ate at two other buffets that week, at the Bellagio and Monte Carlo.  Service at Bellagio was excellent, even though it was packed.  Our server was efficient in refilling our drinks and I always came back with no plate sitting there.  Even at Monte Carlo, where drinks were self-serve from their fountain station, our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  At nearly $30 after taxes for brunch, I expect great service when the competition like Bellagio and Wynn provide that for $10 less. But was we got was pretty much non-existent.
I LOVED the Wicked Spoon!! The staff was so friendly, nice and welcoming. We had never eaten here but had seen the reviews and also this place was on Travel Channel. The food was excellent, the restaurant is clean, well lit and a true pleasure. I will definitely go back!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
Yay!! First, I like having an excuse to walk through the Cosmo to get a glimpse of the three story chandelier and the video pillars. (Soo cool!!). . Second, awesome awesome bloody Marys!. . Third, food is pretty darn good! I do wish that there was more seafood, but still there were some tasty items!. . I really enjoyed the crispy duck wings and lamb ribs . . . though I did feel guilty afterwards for eating such cute creatures (they are so decadent though. . . ). . The escargot polenta is REALLY rich but OH SO good!!. . Gelato bar is dangerous . . . thai tea flavor SO yummy!. . Also, the watermelon siracha dessert kind of blew my mind -- sweet, spicy and refreshing!. . Great service too. Would recommend, and while the food was good, it wasn't mesmerizing enough to justify the $35 price tag (+$12 for bottomless champagne/ mimosa/ bloody Mary).
I went in thinking I was going to walk into a spread of Gorilla brains or Aardvark risotto based on reading the reviews alone preceding this, but definitely after consuming the food here I am happily a fan. I won't lie there are odd choices at a few stations, BUT it did seem to work so kudos to that!. . The highlight for me was the watermelon Sriracha. I am by no means a ghost chili consumer, but damned if that wasn't the best combination I've ever had far as fruits and veggies go. The other item that stuck out was the pork belly fried rice. The presentation was awesome as it came in a mini chinese take out box.. . As far as buffets go, to date I feel this one was an underdog and is the best one on the strip I have experienced so far! For the simple fact that the food tasted fresh and not like it was incubating for hours and overall taste!
Went to try this buffet after hearing a few good things about it. We arrived noticing the line wasn't so long like other buffets. We probably waited 20 mins for a table of 3. I guess the reason was because the food totally sucks!! There seemed to be a lot of experimentation and stuff that didn't work out. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Wtf? The eggs Benedict was bland, the rice in the risotto was semi crunchy, and I avoided the Asian food and sushi all together, they looked like they came from some packed food!  Food seemed to be undercooked or under flavored. I got some food that was still cold or got cold for being out too long. The wait staff was nice and friendly though. 1 star for them but 0 for the food. Avoid at all costs! Go to bacchanal M or whatever else. This is not worth $35 for brunch, gotta be crazy spending extra for mimosas for a bad experience
Was surprised to see no line for Sunday brunch. Should have known why...food is very underwhelming for the price point. Food was bland, cold, lack of selection, and overall did not taste good. I expected more esp. It being inside the cosmopolitan! Cesar's and M buffet are the places to go when in Vegas. A little pricer but food significantly better. You've been warned!
I went here for brunch/lunch to try something different from bacchanal. Biggest mistake of my life. A lot of it was undercooked. I really felt like I was at Hometown Buffet typical pizza, wings, disgusting mac n cheese, weird mash potatoes, non tender meat, and cereal. Currently in the toilet trying to flush it out of my system. #notimpressed
Good but not great.  Lets face it,  Las Vegas is known for its endless selection of buffets,  most of what are meh, not great.  The appeal of this buffet is the small portions prepared fresh.   Unfortunately the selection is more about appearance than flavor.  The beef marrow bones are good but most people seemed to avoid trying them. Many of the dishes looked nice, but tasted like typical Vegas buffet foods.  The best part of this buffet was the dessert selection. But even then, spending the equivalent amount of money in a regular restaurant will always deliver better flavors and quality of dishes. This buffet is more about the Vegas experience.  If you want to feel fancy while wasting money, this is the place. If you want great food, visit a well reviewed restaurant.
Maybe I got too hyped up about this place but I have to say that I don't see they hype that everyone is talking about.  It was a typical Las Vegas buffet.
You know this is a gourmet buffet when they serve everything in little dishes and plates! The overall presentation was very elegant and fancy.. . Wait was around 30-45 minutes on a Friday night around 8 PM.  I was very impressed by the bone marrow and snow crab. Snow crab is chilled and already cut open for your own convenience. I also enjoyed the creamed corn and mashed potatoes. As for the bone marrow, I just now expanded my taste palette after my experience here. Never thought I would ever enjoy that!. . The Asian food was definitely a miss. As a matter of fact, most of the items served here were a hit or miss. I did not enjoy the deceptive "tonkotsu ramen." NO where near the taste and authenticity at all. . . I also witnessed some chef-people-person yelling at customers for using the wrong utensil to pick up the food. So unnecessary and unprofessional. A serene warning would have been more fair.
Simple and Sweet. . I think Wicked Spoon is probably the definition of vegas buffet! The good chunk of dishes are plated like Hors d'oeuvres. This is good because it helps with being able to try everything in the restaurant! All the food is fresh and amazing and the time they put into the attention to detail is fantastic!. . I went on a Sunday brunch around 11:30 and only had to wait 30 minutes. Now i say ONLY 30 minutes because a lot of other solid buffets in Vegas take 2 hours just to get to the cash register and that doesn't even include waiting for a table!. . As for price it was averagely priced (or i think it was) at $35. Pretty reasonable for solid food and beverages. The service was outstanding and the water they give is not tap. They have a special filter in house and serve it in a glass vase bottle. (SO FANCY!). . I would say go try it if you want the Vegas buffet experience and trying not to stay on a reasonable budget. (the rest of the money goes towards bottle service at clubs and gambling! Am i right? :D)
Wicked spoon food is really good food but looked more focused on Chinese and sea food !! Although deserts here are delicious which will make you FAT :)
We came for brunch on Sunday and sadly the quality of food has definitely gone down here compared to previous trips. The selection was pretty average to below average for a Vegas buffet. They had your usual salads, chinese food, meat carving stations, and seafood and made to order omelettes for brunch. But the entree items themselves simply weren't that appetizing. i mean cmon they served cream of corn as a entree? Where's the exotic meats like at the Bellagio? Or at least something memorable and i want to eat more of! . . The best part still has to be the desserts especially the gelato! You can't go wrong with sweets! Yes they can do half n half scoops too. . . The service staff was friendly as usual and cleared our plates pretty quickly even though the place was packed. . . Overall, this place has become a hit and miss for us. I guess we'll see again next time if they've improved.
Waited an hour to be seated while there were tons of empty seats open.. . Food was horrible . . Only good thing was pizza and omelets.. Never again
Mmmmmm
I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars but don't have that option. I bumped it to a 4 because of the gelato. I ate a few things but was not totally impressed. My favorites included the congee plus fixings, bone marrow and the hazelnut gelato. . I also liked the decor and how the buffet was set up. It wish very modern and doesn't look like you're typical buffet. . We opted for the bottomless mimosas. That was worth it. I think it an additional $12. I saw my friend add the mango passion juice from the buffet to the mimosa and it made them even better.
The phrase that comes to mind when describing this place is "quality not quantity."  This place is Amazing! i loved it! I can't say enough about it.  .       The food they had was everything that I love.  They had a lot of the type of sides you would find at like Ruth Chris's. The presentation on these dishes was so cool and unique, like the little Chinese takeout boxes..    I was in foodie Disneyland, so far this is in the top 3 buffets for me.  The other two great ones are at the Wynn, and the Buchannal at Ceasars.  Wicked Spoon may be my favorite though.  When googling buffets, another one that's supposed to be great is the one at the M Resort.  Let me tell you, that was a huge dissapointment - mediocre. This place is LEVELS above!!
The food was delicious but the hour long wait was most definitely not. We paid for our meal at 8pm and were told it was a 45 minute wait before we were seated. While waiting in line (which took an hour) we watched as several empty tables were left unattended while we waited to be seated. Even after the empty tables were cleaned, no one was seated at those tables! There was a long line outside! I asked the hostess once we got to the front of the line why no one was being seated at these many empty tables and she said people were coming and going for food so it's hard to tell. Baloney. We diligently watched during our 60 minute wait as these seats remained empty and we remained hungry. . . I don't appreciate paying full price for a buffet up front and then being forced to wait on purpose for our meal.
Best buffet I've ever experienced! Quality was amazing. The choices were absolutely not your standard buffet choices.. . There were many options to choose from that would satisfy your tastebuds and make you forget you're at a buffet.. . Definitely will return.
The food was salty.
This is weird but....despite the fact that we ate a lot, and pretty much enjoyed what we ate....I can't recall a single thing. Mac and Cheese with added shrimp was cool.....so was the cerviche....but nothing at burned itself into my memory. Nothing extraordinary, nothing to rave about and nothing to go back to. It wasn't awesome and it didn't suck. It was just...alright. . . (as an aside, however I really liked the parking system at the Cosmo, the little light system that shows you were vacant spots are. As a casino its pretty cool if out of my budget.)
This place was a disappointment. I came here when they just opened years ago and all the food items were just marvelous. Their food quality has really watered down through the years.. . The crab legs tasted like they just thawed out - really bland. The risotto was undercooked. There really wasn't anything that's worth raving about, except maybe the bone marrow.. . Oh, I loved most of the desserts, especially the Nutella ice cream - yum! . . I will stick with the Bacchanal for now but I really do hope they do something to improve their menu.
We thought coming by around 2pm would pass the lunch rush but it was still packed. There were 8 of us and we had to wait a while because there weren't any tables available that would fit all of us. . . The food was good; I had like 3 servings of the mac n' cheese and 10 of these little ice cream cones filled with goat cheese. . . They must have been switching to the afternoon/dinner items because 1/3 of the stations were closed and they weren't refilling certain items.
We were so excited to come to Wicked Spoon because we read so many good reviews and raves from our friends.. . Big disappointment. The wait wasn't even a big deal (they seat first come first serve, not by party size, so we waited for almost an hour for a table for 2). The food selection was very large and impressive, but the actual taste of the food was so mediocre. I give them kudos for all the cool unique combinations and fusions they came up with (Sriracha watermelon, anyone?) However, most of the other dishes were just too salty or spiced an incorrect amount. (Avoid the Chinese food, if you can even call it that). . . In the end, I filled myself up with the mushroom pasta, which came in a cool metal ladle, and the steak. The rest of the items were just disappointing. . . The dessert selection, I will admit, is amazing. Most of the dessert items I tried were quite good. . . I wouldn't go back for the price of $41/person.
Horrible service. Would not recommend.  You do not get the service for the price you pay. Also the food the mediocre.
The infamous Vegas buffet was just ok.... Tons of food were cold and not fresh. . even the crab legs they had was just ok. . . Overrated for sure. . The additional 12 dollars for bottomless champagne was good tho
Once in a lifetime experience. . . You can go to Vegas not for gambling, but for this buffet.. . People may say it expensive but it is worth the price. The dessert selection will blew you off. Lots of variety and all of them are god.. . I seriously recommend to go here than wasting your money in a casino.. . There is no love sincere than the love of food.
Never thought I'd say "higher end" buffet but this is it. Came here on our last morning in Vegas and it was delish. A ton of variety for everyone and huge range of food at all hours of the day. Be prepared for the price tag but not much more than you'd pay at any other place in Vegas...def a recommend.
Wicked Spoon is definitely in a league of its own.  It is not a massive buffet venue, like the Bellagio Buffet or any other standard Vegas hotel buffet.  Wicked Spoon is dimly lit with intimate seating, varying from tables of two to round tables of about eight.  The buffet opens at 5pm, and the BF and I were starving since we landed in Vegas about 3pm.  We got there at 6pm and there was no wait at all.  However, about 30 minutes after we sat down, the line was around the corner.  . . The Wicked Spoon dishes are individually plated, which (pro) allows you to have many full dishes but (con) you can fit about 2-3 small plates on your big plate.  The BF mentioned that they should consider getting plates large enough to fit 4 of their small plates - not a bad idea! I did get tired of having to go back and forth so often and having to carry a plate with two plates on top and another small plate in my other hand.  . . As for food, i will mention of the tasty morsels I had.  I know the assortment changes everyday, but hopefully this can give you some insight into what you would expect from Wicked Spoon. . . Custom macaroni and cheese station - you choose the fixings and the friendly chef makes you a yummy concoction.  Toppings include proscuitto, bacon, onions, chicken, and shrimp. . . Roasted duck with cherry glaze - so good!. . Pork tacos and guacamole. . Waldorf salad. . Ahi tuna poke . . Gnocchi with mushrooms - one of my favorites, but heavy . . Prime rib - be aware of the horseradish! It is overpowering! . . 5-spice asian wings . . Fried rice with pork belly . . Desserts - macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, a variety of gluten-free items, chocolate lava cake, mango mousse. . Overall, Wicked Spoon was a great experience, but next time, the BF wants a REAL Vegas buffet eating extravaganza.  Wicked Spoon is definitely a fancied-up buffet with a guy's worst nightmare - tapas.  i heard the brunch is amazing, so I will have to try that.
Keto friendly buffet.. . Meat here was better than Bacchanal, minus the ribs which were dry and tough.. . Bone marrow, prime rib, fatty pork belly all fell into my high fat low carb macros.. . They have a sugar-free pudding that is also gluten free which was delicious, I personally had 5 servings of it.. . As for normal dieters they seemed to have enjoyed their food as well. The mac and cheese bar was praised by everyone else at my table.. . Definitely comparable to Bacchanal but 10 dollars cheaper.
When I went to the wicked spoon it wasn't that great actually when I walked out of the bathroom I slipped in vomit in was gross but of course no one was there to inform that vomit was there. after we talked to the manager they gave me $100 gift card to buy new clothes, comp room, payed for the meal, and let me take a shower in one of the rooms.
I don't usually do buffets but this one has a ton of choices. . . Un/fortunately the best thing I ate at this buffet was the angry mac and cheese. Although the menu was creative and fun, the execution could use a little help. . . The "lava" cake was actually chocolate cake with raspberry preserves inside ? The pork belly wasn't as crispy as it should be. . . The must haves if you are going to this buffet are: aforementioned angry mac and cheese, hazelnut gelato, any of their super fresh salads & maybe something with a poached egg (flawlessly poached even for a crowd !). . . If I'm back in Vegas, I may visit again at dinner (we came for brunch).
One of my favorite buffets! . . I LOVE the oriental station with the mini takeout boxes of noodles!!!! Soso cute and tasty. I really enjoyed the Angry mac and cheese along with their asparagus salad. I tried almost everything in this buffet and they were worth coming back for. . . Also,the bone marrow was gross. It's not fair for me to compare it to the ones they serve at Wolfgang Puck's Cut, but this just had an unsavory texture, which was bland and chewy.. . Overall the Wicked Spoon has done an incredible job and I would absolutely return.
The skinny: Decent selection of food, mediocre quality, long wait time, and overpriced. . . Decided to try Wicked Spoon Sunday morning of EDC weekend. Unfortunately, I missed brunch, but was still extremely excited to try the rival buffet to Cesar's Bacchanal. My final decision: I'm going to stick to Bacchanal's. . . The array of food selection was limited. They seemed to try to put a spin on the conventional food types (like putting bleu cheese on the pizza instead of mozzarella or adding salmon to the chow mein). While this might of been hip or different, it definitely did not mean better tasting. Nonetheless, I can appreciate the attempt.. . Another odd practice was the fact that after ordering a Coke, the server brought out two glasses of coke filled with ice. He probably did this so that he did not have to come back again for any refill, but it also made my second glass unenjoyable since by the time I got through with the first glass of coke, the second had been watered down due to the dissolving of the ice. That being said, I only saw my server twice.. . My 3-rating is based primarily on my opinion that I think Bacchanal is a better buffet. They have a greater variety of food that appeals to more people. Their food tastes more fresh and is warm. The wait time for Bacchanal has improved with their new seating system so you don't have to wait in line bored to death, as I did waiting in line for Wicked Spoon. One thing that makes Wicked Spoon better, though, is that their bathrooms are actually in the restaurant. It's a bit weirdthat Bacchanal places their restrooms outside of the buffet. Regardless, I think everyone should try a buffet when going to Vegas. The different variety of foods you can try is great and it is an enjoyable eating experience that you can share with friends and family.
This was the husband and my second time at the wicked spoon. We left prostrate and pathetic after two hours of nearly constant consumption of food and drink. This is a ritual of any Vegas vacation.. . The good. The bagel and lox was great, as was the bacon. We also enjoyed the shrimp, salmon Benedict, and dessert selection. We may also have drank our weight in mimosas. Eat the gelato.. . The bad. Whatever was being served instead of prime rib was more akin to the heavily seasoned meat of Brazilian steakhouses. It was ok, if misrepresented by the presence of horseradish and somewhat overdone. The bone marrow, on the other hand was undercooked and wholly inedible. The juice in the breakfast bar was warm and unpleasant. The sushi was unspectacular and the beet salad was unimpressive. . . Now for the ugly and why it's barely getting three stars. The women's bathroom was absurdly filthy. I'm talking vomit in the stalls, dirty thongs on the ground dirty. I understand that this restaurant turns over a lot of drunk ladies, but I expect cleanliness in a restaurant with no exceptions or extenuating circumstances. If a custodian with a mop needs to be stationed in the ladies room 24/7, do it. If this is what the women's restroom looked like I can only assume the men's was an ankle deep pool of piss. Bring your snorkels and floatation devices, gentlemen.
I really don't understand the hype. I've been going to Bacchanal the past couple of times I've been to Vegas but all my friends keep telling me to try Wicked Spoon. Sooooo, giving in to the peer pressure, I decided to make a visit on a Saturday at 2PM. . . My first warning should have been that the place was pretty empty and lines nonexistent. I mean, I've been to Bacchanal on a TUESDAY at the same time and had to get a number to get back INTO line later. As I was walking through the stations, I noticed the appalling fact that there were so few selections! Even in the salad/seafood bar, there were barely any items to choose from compared to many other lower-end buffets in Vegas. . . Per Yelper suggestions, I tried the pork belly and the Mac 'n cheese to start, along with the compulsory sushi selections. The sushi was decent, the Mac 'n cheese bland, and the pork belly disappointing. I also had a chance to try some sirloin, prime rib, and thick-cut bacon. Everything was just ok - the beef was tough, dry, and extremely salty. Even the horseradish couldn't save it. The mashed potatoes and the jalapeno creamed corn was better than the meat selection unfortunately. The bone marrow was a unique dish but wasn't as delicious as I would've hoped. The steamed crab was good - I appreciated that they had this hot option, but they also didn't have any butter to dip the crab in. How... odd. The ramen was decent, but again, I appreciated that they had this selection and even offered up an egg with it. The dessert selection was again, both sparse and disappointing. Nothing tasted exceptionally delicious except for the gelato. The Thai tea gelato was really the savior of the night, just is really something quite sad to say for a buffet. . . Service was attentive in the beginning but lacking towards the end of our meal. We asked for a Coke and was given Pepsi. It would've been better if they just told just they don't have Coke. . . Overall, I would STRONGLY suggest going to Bacchanal Buffet if you're looking for a higher-end buffet. Everything about Wicked Spoon was a wicked disappointment. :(
Amazing. Wonderful food! Only meal in Vegas I've had so far that was worth the price tag.
After reading all the reviews on yelp, It looked like one of the best buffets. However, I was quite disappointed. They didn't have that much to offer. The service was also quite disappointing.  When my friend and I went to get more food, our servant took our away our utensils and our cups.. The desserts were amazing.. there was a lot to choose from, like chocolate strawberries, cake, gelato, etc.. I got the thai tea gelato which was amazing.. wasn't too sweet. Comparing this buffet to Spice Market buffet over at Planet Hollywood, I think Spice Market had more variety. but the desserts over at Wicked Spoon was better.
Not impressed. Only 3 sushi-. Salmon, and some Tempura crab sushi.. Not enough variety in the Chinese and Italian Selection. Food was either over seasoned - too salty- or under seasoned. . Bottom line, not worth the money.
I am sorry but after experiencing The Buffet at Aria wicked spoon does not compare. Bad selection food is just okay and I was disappointed with most of the food I ate. The chef at the omelet station needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to make an omelet.
Well it does provide a wide variety of options for everyone! The food here was hit or miss. Some of the stations were out of this world fantastic and some missed the mark. I will give 4 stars to the squid ink pasta and the benedicts- those were delicious. The strawberry watermelon smoothies were AMAZING. They came in little shot glasses and I swear we each had 5 or 6. I wasnt impressed with the rest of the food and it wasnt worth the $40 per person we paid to get in.
I LOVED the Wicked Spoon when it was brand new...not too expensive, great quality food, lots of variety...but I went back last month and was disappointment with the selection of vegetarian options. I ended up paying $40+ to just eat some vegetables and salad. Other Vegas buffets have great tofu/soy options so I'm hoping in the future the Wicked Spoon will follow suit. . . Also, I really miss the fudge bar! The desserts were still good but they used to be great.
I honestly have no idea how this buffet got ranked #1. You want to know how, I'll tell you. People see the individual portions served in fancy little containers and automatically go crazy for it immediately blinding themselves from the fact that the food is just ok. Now the food is not bad, the service is terrible. If you enter the Cosmopolitan from the back side hotel entrance, you have a mile long walk to find this place. It is tucked away upstairs in a back portion of the building. . . The only reason we tried this place is because it was ranked #1 and I dont know who does the rankings, but if they think this is #1, they must have judged it on looks and serving containers because this place is severely OVERRATED!!!! One thing is for sure, I definitely will not be back to the Wicked Spoon. While the gelato choices are many, I had the pistachio gelato and was very good, do not buy into all the hype around this place, it is not worth it. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else, you will be glad you did.
Super buffet avec petites portions d'une qualite dignes d'un grand restaurant. . Poisson et viande de grande qualite. Tres bons accompagnements (risotto,  gnocchi, puree maison, polenta) et  desserts succulents (fondant au chocolat et gelato a essayer).. Seuls les sushis dont decevants mais il y a tant d'autres choses a gouter que ce n'est pas un probleme. . Le champagne compris dans le forfait a 12  illimite est d'une qualite tres correcte. Le vin par contre est d'une qualite tres moyenne.
Wicked Spoon's an interesting buffet place with a wide variety of different food. I came here during brunch to get some food. Even though it was brunch time, there was pizza, chicken wings, sliced beef, etc. The buffet also had your usual breakfast food items.. . == Food ==. . Brunch was pretty good here. They have Eggs Benedict here! Comes with salmon or pork. The soft boiled egg is cooked just about right with a nice gooey inside.. . There's bone marrow here for everyone who's interested. I haven't seen a buffet serve up bone marrow before, but it's not my cup of tea.. . There's various cuts of meat here also such as sausages, beef, and pork. They were all delicious and tender. . . There's a very wide variety of desserts ranging from cakes to ice cream. They are alright, but everything tasted pretty blank on the dessert side. Nothing special, but it wasn't bad either.. . == Service ==. . Service was pretty good. The waitress came around often enough to refill drinks.. . == Overall ==. . The eggs benedict makes this buffet stand out. The various cuts of meat here is good too. Definitely worth the money.
I do not usually eat buffet, but I always come to wicked spoon for my Vegas trip. The most important WARNING: this restaurant has its good things and bad things. . .   First of all, I never wait for the times I visited since i always around 1-2 pm. I guess people were still having hang overs. The price for lunch was $37, which is the same amount as Caesars palace. .   The things I like about wicked spoon are:. 1. I loveeeee the interior design , and the vibe in this restaurant. The staff was very active too.. 2. The salad here was really good !!!!! I can't stop eating them . 3. You have so many choices, and they all come with small portions. As a person with a small appetite, they are so prefect for me. I can actually try everything in this restaurant.    However. The things I do not like: . 1. I love how they have very weird and wicked dishes, but not every one of them is delicious ! Sometimes it even taste bad. 2. As a meat lover, I think their fried chicken need to improve !!!!!!!. . Others than that, I would say I will still come to wicked spoon when I visit Las Vegas:)
This place met my expectations and more. Offers military discount (15%), delicious food, and friendly service. As a vegetarian they offered me plenty of options to eat as well. Best buffet I've been to.
Not worth it. Expensive and quality of food isn't up to par. Left unsatisfied. Will not come back.
Love this buffet! Would definitely come back next time when in vegas! Love their small dishes! So delicious! Their bone marrow are not as impressive as I would hope and their crab legs are not as good as Caesars' buffet, but their other hot food dishes are in general very good! I enjoyed it very much! They have too many food too! Wanna try everything but just couldn't!! Will for sure try next time! And their gelato! Pistachio flavor was one of the best I have ever tasted! And their have fun Thai tea flavor as well :) love it!
Our server pissed me off.  I ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  It came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a Moscow mule. We asked to have it changed on the bill, since I ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  Rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim I've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! . . As for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  The mashed potatoes were good, I'll give 'em that. A couple of the pastas were serviceable.  Everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  And a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  Not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  Hmmmm.  . . Overall, pretty disappointing.  You think you're paying more for unique menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish.
For a $40 pp buffet, this place certainly leaves me wanting more. After scoping out the pictures on Yelp, I was very excited at the idea of an upscale buffet with delicious food - especially the small plates.. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed. "This is essentially like Golden Corral but twice the price." That's my boyfriend who eats anything voicing his disappointment.. Yeah... the food was blah. Mostly tasteless. The polenta was super salty and this is from someone who adds salt to everything! Minimal seafood selection. Cold stale sushi - you get the idea.. Literally the only saving grace was the dessert bar which was fantastic. But man cannot live on gelato alone.. My advice, save your hard earned mulah and skip this one. You can definitely getm better for less in Vegas - the land of good food.
Brunch Buffet is great. Service is kind of spotty, but the food - for a buffet - is awesome. But it is still a buffet, people. Is it amazing compared to every other buffet on the planet? Yes. It is amazing compared to a sit down restaurant where everything is made fresh to order? . . No, so don't expect that. Instead, sit down, unfasten your belt, and gorge until you enter a coma. Boom.
Let's just sum it up pretty quick all you can eat.. Pork Belly . Bone Marrow, and all the great flavor selections of gelato. I'm happy with that ,but they do have other great gourmet food selections.
This was my second time at Wicked Spoon.  The first time was amazing but this second time - I dunno - maybe they were having a bad day.  The food was 'ok'.  The desserts were amazing just like last time.
Preview the buffet before paying as you may be surprised that the selection and quality of food is just okay. Compared to Bellagio's, Wynn's, or Caesar's buffets, the Wicked Spoon is just wicked. I thought with the Cosmopolitan Hotel being new and hip that the food would follow suit, but surprisingly it's meh. Perhaps, the less spoiled palate would enjoy this buffet?! The buffet is on par with the Rio's, and close to Planet Hollywood's buffets. I just expected more and that's where I take responsibility for this wicked outing. I should have previewed the buffet as I am recommending, kept my expectations low, and perhaps I would have been pleasantly surprised rather than disappointed. I don't think it would have really mattered as my friends were extremely hungry and we just wanted to sit down and eat. With that being said, we were starving and the food still didn't taste that great. So, you have been fairly warned... If you choose to take this Yelp review with a grain of salt, I'll bet you'll join me later with a similar review. Wishing you only good eats and service... Eat On ;D
Back home on the East Coast, planning for my Vegas trip, the Wicked Spoon had become almost legendary in my mind. The reality was... well, almost as good.. . I came at lunchtime on a Tuesday and there was no line. The buffet is a little smaller than I expected, but still, you will be well fed. They have a lot of unusual items that make your meal an interesting one. The surprises, to me: duck wings were particularly memorable, as was the polenta with escargot, porcini, and garlic butter reduction. At buffets I always think of potatoes and polenta as the cheap foods they try to fill you up with, but that was some seriously delicious polenta. And the bone marrow is a great feature of this buffet... risking a heart attack, I got it again each time I got up for a new plate. I'd never had it before but now I will crave it.. . Wicked Spoon is especially well-known for its desserts, and maybe this is just because it was lunchtime, but I really didn't think they were that impressive. The gelato selection is great, and they have a lot of chocolate-covered strawberries... but most of the options were skip-able to me. It's definitely way better than most buffets in this aspect, however.. . My server was excellent (African American lady, nose piercing-- I don't know her name, but if management sees this I'd like them to be able to identify her!). She was attentive and treated customers with respect-- and by that I mean her vibe was "you're a person to me, not just another table I have to deal with." . . While I was in Vegas I ate at both this place and Bacchanal. Honestly if you're going to choose just one I'd go with Bacchanal, but it's a close match. And, there's an Art-o-Mat machine right outside it-- a converted former cigarette machine that sells unique art at $5 a box!
Came here for brunch. I thought it was super overpriced at $35. Good selection, but the food was pretty average overall.
What happened! You were my favorite. I was so excited to introduce you to my fiance but when I saw the selection I was embarrassed to say maybe they will make or bake more FRESH food.  Needless to say at the end. I was disappointed. . . Let's move on to dessert. Very pleased with the variety.  We had more change of plates than the main course.  . . Note to paying - SEE and look around before paying.  You will determine whether or not your up to eating hours of stale looking food or constant fresh, eye appealing mouth watering, yes I'm hungry I can't wait to eat food.
A very good buffet with the perfect amount of selection.. . I know that Vegas is home to some pretty big contenders in the buffet world and that the wicked spoon is a little smaller than a few of the giants. I still personally think that this place makes up for size in quality. I would actually prefer the size of the wicked spoon over the bigger guys. Hehe maybe because I'm indecisive?. . We went during brunch when there wasn't much of a crowd so I'm not sure how bad it can get. There are several different sections here with mostly Asian, Italian, and American offerings. I found that the food was a hit or miss with a few gems sprinkled in there. That was mostly the reason for the four star rating. A lot of the food is good, some of it is excellent, and some of it is just weird. I noticed, like many buffets in the area, they tended to have a few dishes with some experimental flavors. Hmmm yea dishes like the watermelon Siracha didn't really do it for me. I also tended to stay away from the Asian section as it honestly wasn't that great. On the other hand if you love desserts, you are going to love their dessert section here. I thought it was the most consistent/ strongest section they had. I don't think I was disappointed with anything I grabbed from there. Plus the gelato bar at the wicked spoon is amazing! I went at least 4 times. . . The price is pretty reasonable at $30 a person as of aug 2014. Its about what you'd pay everywhere else. The soft drinks and ice tea are complementary and they have unlimited wine and mimosas for a little extra. The staff is friendly and helpful. They cleared plates and refilled drinks quickly so no complaints there. The one minor thing that did bother me about this buffet was the fact that some of the food is already portioned out for you. I generally wanted a little less then what they had on the plate but it's very minor.. . If you're not looking for any Asian food I think this is a great buffet to check out.
Amazing dinner buffet... With BONE MARROW!. LOVED this buffet... definitely high up there and worth the money! At dinner they had a create your own mac and cheese section! Still comes second in my opinion to the ceasar's buffet, but delicious none the less.
In Vegas, there are so many big players with gigantic buffets filled with somewhat mediocre food, and the Wicked Spoon is a little on the smaller end. However, the Wicked Spoon really makes up for what it lacks in size, in quality. . . I've been to the Wicked Spoon several times and I've never been disappointed in the offerings. The food changes a little bit from time to time which makes each experience a little bit different.. . Tip: Expect to wait in line for quite a while if you come anytime near brunch or dinner.
I actually give them some credit for having customers pay before they have to wait an hour in line.  I just think its smart for a business.. . Now to the food.... The plating and looks of the food was excellent.  The taste was nowhere near $41.  It was more like $9.99 food.  First of all everything was drenched in oil.  I felt like throwing up after the first bite.. The meat had bad flavor to it.  I think its five spice or something like that.  Im Asian and I hated it.  The ribs were tough and salty like beef jerky.  The lamb was good but too salty.  The puree with the salmon had an odd taste.  The calamari smelled fishy.  The crab legs were thin and not tasty at all.  Maybe they were just trying to mask the taste of ingredients that arent fresh?. The icecream was good though.  Actually the icecream was excellent! $41 for icecream!
Wicked Spoon is a mediocre buffet. The thing is, the presentation is amazing and the options are definitely gourmet, but the quality of the food is lacking and definitely not worth $40 a person for dinner. . . I've ate at most of the buffets in Las Vegas and there is much better options for the price. For buffets I work on a price:quality ratio, if the price is high (over $29) the quality must be excellent. I would rather have less selection, but high quality food.. . The crab legs were not fresh and had a sandy taste to them. A lot of the food was over powered with salt. On a better note, the prime rib was excellent!. . Perhaps, I just caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately I won't be returning to Wicked Spoon.
People were raving about this place and personally I don't get it. Make sure you go check it out before you decide to stay. The selection was mediocre at best... And the quality just not what I would expect from the hip Cosmopolitan. Service was good... Food was meh.
This place is mediocre at best. It's a hit or miss with the food. I guess things would taste a lot better if the food was fresh but I guess I went during the time when they weren't making a lot of new items (2PM). They have very limited selections of seafood (which I love)... well they have a limited selection of everything.. .  I went around 2 and got seated with no problem; the line move relatively fast. . . For $37; I would suggest you save your money and go somewhere else. . Two stars for the ice cream; they have Thai Ice Tea flavor yum!
Honestly... I don't get the crazy amount of positive reviews for this place (disclaimer: I went for lunch, not dinner). I can't say anything was amazing here and would not recommend to a friend. Maybe their dinner is worthwhile? I rather stick to the buffet inside the Wynn ! . . Also, what happened to the service here? That alone knocked off 2 stars for me. There was (yes, I counted) 5 times I came back with food and the tables were not cleaned up. Not to mention trying to get someone's attention for plain water.
I gave this five stars.. 1. Great customer service . 2. Great selection. 3. Nice presentation. 4. Food is fresh. 5. Food tastes great . I'm not one who usually frequents Buffets. But I have to say this buffet is awesome!. I could say it has put other buffets to shame, or at least ones I have tried. I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in town.
Pricing: Expensive. As befitting a Vegas buffet.. Quality: Good-Excellent. Best French toast ever and interesting desserts.. Turnaround: Good. A little funky from breakfast to lunch, but otherwise trays are full of food.. Service: Excellent. Someone was always ready to clear empty dishes and refills drinks.. . We made it in time just for breakfast, but late enough so that we get to eat through lunch as well. Needless to say that even for breakfast at a lower price of about $30 or so when I went back in June, I did not feel the food was quite worth the cost. The most expensive items were the steak and crab legs (available for lunch), but the steak was overcooked and chewy with just simple salt and pepper seasoning. The crab legs were better, but the long line coupled with the fact that some of crab legs were not fresh and thereby mushy in texture was a big turn off. However, I must recommend the French toast. They were fluffiest piece of heaven I ever had. I kept getting them as soon as the chef put them out, which I know most people will scoff at since French toasts are just carbs, but trust me, they are heaven! The poached eggs were good and the mac-n-cheese were so creamy that they slid perfectly down my throat. Most of the meat options were either bland, dry, or of a bad cut, but the sausages were delicious! Moving from there, the dessert options were varied and huge. A lot of them were kind of mediocre and did not really stand out, remind me of store bought packaged desserts, but the gelato options were awesome! I had a strawberry vinaigrette that surprisingly worked and a pistachio that was actually nutty. I wish I saved more room to have more! The turnaround is pretty good with food readily available most of the time, except for during the switch, a lot of food disappears and so do the servers. There was only one guy manning the meat section and he had his hands full cutting and serving all of them to the long line of patrons. Overall, I felt this buffet had superb service since most buffets do not even provide service! Someone was always on hand to remove empty plates and bring new drinks to us while proactively asking us if they could bring us anything else.
Lunch was a huge letdown. We've been before and loved it. This time TONS of breakfast food. I asked if they would be putting out more lunch offerings since it was after 12:30 - they said no. No prime rib, meet selection extremely average. I don't care for seafood, so this review may not be meaningful for people who love that. For me, they had a small selection and it was a big letdown. Staff was very nice and room well appointed. I just think that on a relatively quiet day, it should still be good and it wasn't. Cesars was 1000% better. More small plates of yummy things and more variety. You may want to see what they put out before you pony up the $. Very disappointed. If you want breakfast the huge servings as the Hash House a go-go while not a buffet are much better.
It was a great experience here
Would give it 10if I could. . Hands down the best!
Coffee torte is awesome.  Different dessert than most buffet.. . Mac and cheese bar is different where you can choose salmon, chicken sausage, and bacon. I like the shell pasta,  which makes it different.. . Watermelon with sriracha was quite refreshing. . . Two Lines FOR Buffet was quite confusing. Line to pay and line to sit down. Quite deceiving.
Came here for lunch at 1pm on a Friday and there was no waiting time.. . The food is simply amazing!  The quality is evident and the choices are numerous.  Although we came during lunch time, they had a few breakfast options available, and why not?  Some folks love breakfast and I appreciate that they included this in the lunch menu.  The smoked salmon eggs Benedict is delicious.  . . I typically don't like mac-n-cheese, but their "angry mac-n-cheese" is delectable.  I didn't eat much of it but I finished the amount I got on my plate.  Normally, I toss aside whatever I don't like on my plate at buffets  but I finished all the mac-n-chees here!  . . But anyway, here's a run down of what they served for lunch when I was there.  No shell fish of any kind was offered.  So if you're looking to score on seafood, go elsewhere.. . Pulled pork eggs Benedict and smoked salmon eggs Benedict (so good!). Red velvet pancakes and french toast (pancakes are delish). Breakfast patty sausage. Bacon (who doesn't like bacon?). Half bagels with cream cheese and/or jam, butter. More breakfast options I can't remember. Creamy mushroom soup with corn and jalapeno (amazing, grab two). Creamy pasta with mushroom and peas (think Alfredo with twisted pasta). Creamy polenta with escargot (yes, you read that right! Snails are alright!). Risotto with saffron ( a littlesalty but still tasty). Indian curry with lamb, with option of raita (pretty darn good). Bone marrow ( tasted like fatty oil, lard...? At least I tried it!). Portobello mushroom topped with goat cheese and some balsamic vinaigrette. Spicy mac-n-cheese (darn good!). Kielbasa sausage. Pineapple glazed pork roast. Pork roast. Beef roast. Fried chicken wing in a mini basket . Sauteed zucchini with olive oil, salt and pepper (my fave veg dish here!). Sauteed red and yellow bell peppers (loved this too!). 4 diff pizzas and a 3 cheese and egg panini sandwich. Made to order omelet station. Heirloom tomato caprese salad (fresh mozzarella balls!). Kale and cranberry salad . Cobb salad with bacon. Caesar salad. A big ol' plate of smoked salmon (OMG, love). Some sort watermelon smoothie in a small shooter (got at least 3 of these!). Lots of fresh fruit . Other salad options I can't remember. Build your own salad. California, spicy ca, and salmon nigiri rolls. Congee with Chinese donuts. Stir fried udon. Chinese spicy chicken stir fry. Chinese BBQ pork. Shrimp balls. Teriyaki chicken wing over white rice. About 6 more Asian dishes I can't remember. . I'm not a huge fan on Chinese food (no offense, I just can't digest them readily, maybe the ingredients don't like me?) so I didn't try any of the Asian dishes offered, but there are a lot and I saw a lot folks go for them so they gotta be good!. . Now for desserts! . . At least 10 diff gelatos (blood orange and thai milk tea are my fave, ran out of pistachio :(. Choc lava cake. Peach cobbler. Choc chip, oatmeal raisin cookies. Mango/raspberry panna cota . Goat chese with lavender syrup (lavender is strong...interesting flavor). Mini cupcakes and various chocolate cakes with different flavors. And more that I can't remember, not much of a sweet tooth so I can't really comment on a lot of the dessert section.  . I'm 100% sure I'm missing many more dishes! but as you can see! wicked spoon has an extensive offering.  The quality and presentation are evident and you'll love this buffet.  IMHO, this should've been voted as best buffet in Vegas.  Tried others and I don't understand the hype for some...maybe the lack of shell fish (crab, lobster and the like) bumps this down a couple of ranks.  I honestly feel that other buffets hike up their prices because they offer seafood, and neglect the rest of their other dishes. As a buffet, attention should be given to all areas, not just one area, like the seafood section, IMHO.. . But Wicked Spoon is really an upscale buffet.  The food is way above buffet quality.
Bring your 2nd stomach - your going to need it. Sit straight and take your time to breathe deep - trust me it helps your stomach come through with your appetite. If you can get up, walk a few laps around the wicked spoon but stay away from the buffet. You might not have the will power to stay away - so commit. 2-3 laps around the restaurant before stuffing your stomach with your uncontrollable appetite that you still have from all the delicious food. Run a marathon the next day it helps with the fat burn and it eases the guilt. Enjoy, and stay fit.
Good quality food, very long lines (it took us almost 2 hours to get in) our server was nice
Excellent food and variety, good service and delicious deserts, the taste of the food was very good.
Great atmosphere,  super yummy food and amazing service from a very sweet lady by the name of Lisa D. When I find myself back at the wicked spoon, I'm asking for her section
Their selection of food is superb! Their meats and sushi are delicious! And they have their own "build your own mac n cheese" station!! Totally worth the price.. . The only bad side to this is.....GETTING A FOOD COMA CUZ YOU ATE TOO MUCH. . Dont forget their desserts!  (Passion mango sorbet was amazing!)
