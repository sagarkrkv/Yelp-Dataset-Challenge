Saw good Yelp reviews so thought being that we were staying nearby give it a shot for dinner. However, sooo thoroughly disappointed. Service was mediocre from. Finish to end as staff seemed more preoccupied with bigger tables ( we were only a table for 2)....found also food to be decent as tuna / raspberry skewers were rather bland in taste. We followed up with the potatoes which were no better than any home style fries you'll get at any local breakfast eatery...we thought to give it another try with stuffed peppers with goat cheese and received 2 small peppers. I understood the overall concept of it being a tapas place but overall quite average and nothing special of note for me to encourage others to go......
Was happy to see tapas in Vegas.  We arrived and were seated immediately and welcomed by Donovan our server for the evening.  We started with a martini (berry) don't remember the name and a bottle of wine. Both were delicious and there was a great wine and drink selection.  My husband and I order one tapas each because we knew we wanted for order the paella.  We started with a cheese plate and tuna carpaccio, both very flavorful.  We then ordered the mixed paella, which is by far enough for two.  The seafood was plentiful and included mussels, shrimp, fish, and chorizo.  The rice flavor was wonderful and not overbearing.    The seafood flavors still shined through.  Donovan was an excellent server, very attentive and pleasant, I recommend you ask for him when you dine there.  If you like paella, you can't go wrong at Julian Serrano!!  Enjoy!
Was in Vegas for a work conference at Aria. Made reservations for 15 here a month or so in advanced. They called ahead to confirm and had everything ready when we got there. It's really convenient if you are staying at the Aria, Cosmo or any casino nearby. Had a couple drinks at the bar while waiting for the whole party - bartenders were friendly and attentive.. . Now...for the dinner. We got the Chef's tasting for all of us along with some wine and cocktails. Ummm BEST decision ever - the food was amazing. There were around 6-7 sharable dishes and 3 types of desserts at the end. I have to say that EVERYTHING was amazing. Some of my particular favorites were the scallops, short rib, risotto and oxtail. For dessert, the Churros and almond cake were...amazing. . . I really think this is one of the best restaurants I've tried. The food is super flavorful and inventive. I literally closed my eyes and said "MMMM" several times during the meal. It's a great dining experience for a group - I love variety and sharing plates...makes it a great group experience. Will DEFINITELY go back when I'm Vegas. I am drooling just thinking about it.
The service, food, setting, and whole experience was great. The food is spectacular and the hosts are friendly. Not to mention the wait time for the food is quick. Overall it's an amazing restaurant and I recommend it to anyone, especially if you like tapas.
Was pretty good but not great. We had a few different items that were hit or miss.  Other places I'd rather eat at in Vegas.. . - Tuna rasberry skewer - 4/5 - awesome presentation and flavor was pretty good. - White ceviche - 3/5 stars - needed salt and flavor. I've had much better elsewhere. - Gambas 4/5 stars - one of the better dishes. - Black rice 4/5 stars - very flavorful. - Sliders 3/5 stars - pass, didn't care for these at all. - Bacon wrapped dates - 5/5 awesome. - Spicy meatballs 3/5 - Good, not great
Delicious tapas!! . . Tapas are perfect for me because I like to try a lot of different dishes, but have a small stomach :(. . We had the following:. Seafood paella - meant for sharing! They make a certain amount depending on the number of people in your party. We had a huge plate. It tasted alright. Very flavorful but nothing too amazing. .  . Duck confit - love the presentation. The duck itself was a little dry, not too fond of the citrusy flavor. Not my fav. . . Seared scallop - my favorite of the night. Packed full of flavor and was seared perfectly. . . Oxtail - my friend said it tasted like a Cinnabon..in a good way. I'm not sure about that.. But it was delicious. Had a hoisin flavor too it, and was wrapped in a pastry. The meat was soft. . . Mushroom risotto - tasty and flavorful. No complaints here. Probably my second favorite. . . white ceviche - fish was fresh. Thought it was interesting how they used taro chips instead of the usual. Yum. . . Red sangria was also amazing. I want to drink a whole jug, please. . . Minus the paella, the total bill for two people came out to be around $80. I thought it was well worth it for a fun and tasty dinner in Vegas!!
Tasty tapas. Some came in different numbered and sized servings, which made sharing challenging. Servings listed in parentheses below. In order from favorite to least: . Brava potatoes. Albondigas (4) - wonderful sauce that would go well with a basket of bread. Fried Calamari (3) - perfectly breaded, with a small pepper on each skewer. Creamy Risotto - mushrooms and manchego . Tuna cones (3) . Lobster salad - ruby red dressing, beautiful, but lacked more contrasting ingredients. . Some plates required a communal fork and knife to work through, and definitely could not be shared among more than three. . Duck salad  - looks more like an oblong scotch egg until you cut into it. Crispy and flavorful, with lightly dressed greens. Baby back ribs. . Drinks were solid. I had a tequila and prickly pear puree cocktail that was refreshing and tangy. It would have been nice to have been informed before we ordered of the number of servings in each item. Suggestions would have been welcome from our server, but he seemed a bit frazzled serving our group of 5. Dishes that we enjoyed as a group were fairly standard restaurant appetizers. I was looking forward to being surprised by the seafood and ribs, but that was not the case. . . 3.5 stars
I have eaten here once before and had such a great experience, I just had to come back.  . . I started out with the roasted apple stuffed with foie gras, which was my favorite of the night.  It had a nice blend of sweet and savory and the nuts added some nice texture.. . Next, I hadthe seared scallops which were cooked perfectly.  Well executed, although not particularly innovative.. . I had the short ribs which were a little bit undercooked this time around (the last time I ate here, it was perfectly cooked and tender).  The flavors still were great and the mashed sweet potatoes matched the short ribs well.. . I tried the molten chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet.  I like the contrast in temperatures and the presentation was nice as well with the chocolate cake in one corner, while the sorbet occupied the diametric opposite corner, bridged by a stripe of chocolate.. . The service was ok, but the nice variety of high quality small plates made this a wonderful experience.
During a recent stay at Aria, I did one thing that I NEVER thought I would do while staying at a hotel... I never left the property once during my 3 day stay. I don't know about you, but that is unheard of for me, especially in Vegas. I'm all about the hotel hopping and restaurant at this hotel and this other hotel. . . With that said, Julian Serrano was one of the reasons I never left the property. I simply did not need to. . . I came here for the lunch three-course menu, which I concluded was an AMAZING deal and steal. If you want to try this place out, but are wary about the heavy price tag, come for lunch. It was $19 for a three course meal. . . My three courses was the Wild Mushroom Soup, Rib Eye Steak w/ fries and the Santiago's Cake. I really enjoyed the rich and earthy soup and the rib eye was cooked very nicely and served with thinly cut and crispy fries. The cake was surprisingly delightful and I preferred it over the flan that they offer. . . Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us several times. He also gave us some sangria mini samples and informed us of the happy hour they have daily 4-5:30 which includes sangria and app specials!. . Overall, a good bang for your buck, especially for being at Aria and I'll be sure to come back for their happy hour!
everything about this place is good. from the service to their tapas and their  drinks
Repeat customer here ! . Very nice atmosphere great host and server grilled Lamb chops is AWESOME! Also had Gambas A La Plancha , Gampas , Mariscada , Atlantic Cod , Mixed Seafood Ceviche n Seared Scallap... Dessert Santiagos Cake all AWESOME !
So I've gotten accustomed to ordering the same thing every time I visit here. The sangria is a standard for me, red please! It's not real sangria unless it's red...sorry. I wanted something different this time so I ordered shrimp al ajillo (garlic). Woww...not bad but really spicy and killed the flavor of the shrimp. Tone it down a little. I did eat it though. It was flavorful. The mixed ceviche, not flavor whatsoever. My background is South American and it lacked salt and flavor. I sent it back. So I ordered the usual my anchovy fillets. Delish and fresh. The service was impeccable. The bartender who speaks Spanish and has worked there awhile is excellent and friendly. They all are friendly. I love coming here. They also have a happy hour menu with 1/2 price sangria during certain hours.
$6 for a side of mashed potatoes at lunch? No thanks. Especially since our waiter told me the short ribs came with them. . . Portions are tiny...it is a tapas place, but the prices are just ridiculous. I left their hungry with a $48 tab and that didn't include alcohol. Pretty place and food but skip if you're looking for substance and bang for your buck.
The food is all cold :(  and bland D:   The only reason for 2 stars is that the servers are nice...
Great tapas and good service .Some people from Spain was a little bit disappointed about the food because It was a little bit hot ,but for me was good.(The only thing that was weird  was the huevos rotos,They should to use another kind of potato ).I Will be back next time in Vegas .
If the food wasn't memorable, how many stars is it worth?. . That is the question here.  Reality is, I can only remember liking three things at Julian Serrano...the Red Sangria...Roasted Peppers stuffed with Goat cheese and Cinnamon Hot chocolate in some form.. . I ordered much more, but can only remember that everything looked much prettier and fancier than it tasted.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was great.. . I wouldn't return.
As I was driving to Vegas for my vacation, I was contemplating on dining options and suddenly thought of Julian Serrano. . . Julian Serrano is a great alternative to the multi-course restaurants in Vegas, and here are the reasons that I may revisit the restaurant: . 1) If you are looking for a good place to grab lunch and do not want to wait in line, this is the restaurant for you. . 2) The waiter knows the menu well and points out food for our friends who have dietary restrictions. . 3) The food is simple and arrives on your table quickly. . . However, I have decided to give the restaurant only three stars because of the following reasons:. 1) Although the restaurant is not full, it takes a long time before the host takes notice of us.. 2) The food is good but not great. Having had the tapas in Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat in Chicago, my friends and I are not impressed with the food at Julian Serrano. . 3) The restaurant lacks vegetarian options. If you are a vegetarian, I would recommend you visiting Jean Philippe next doors.. . If you were me, would you visit Julian Serrano again?
My girlfriend and I were very excited to dine here but the food turned out to be appallingly bad, especially for the price. One of our dishes was described as eggs with chorizo on top of fried potatoes. The eggs were bland and mushy, the chorizo had the taste and texture of mediocre hot dog meat, and this restaurant actually had the gall to serve these things on top of pre-made french fries for $11. The other wildly overpriced "tapas" were consistently ill-conceived, poorly cooked, under-seasoned, or some combination thereof. I have never been actively insulted by food before, so the dining experience was unique in that respect. Julian Serrano should be ashamed. Avoid this place if you like food at all and have even a modicum of self-respect.
During a 3 night stay in Vegas, went here for dinner twice. The first night had the cheese plate, lamb skewer, beef and cheese, and mozzarella heirloom tomato. Beef and cheese was definitely the best...the jus was amazing and the beef was extremely tender. Ordered the lamb after hearing good things. Out skewer was over cooked and had a lot of fat. . . Went back another night just so we could order the beef and cheese again. Also ordered tuna raspberry skewer, creamy risotto, oxtail, and sliders. Everything was delicious. The risotto was the best I've ever had and the oxtail was melt in your mouth fantastic. Finished the meal off with the molten lava cake and blood orange sorbet. Usually I find when orange and chocolate are combined, one over powers the other. But this dessert was a great balance.. . Overall this place is great. Smaller portions but food is delicious. Highly recommended if you're staying at the aria or are close by.
Went here for a friend's birthday. Ordered beef and cheese, oxtail, short ribs, calamari, veal, and chorizo. I have to say the oxtail was the best. The servings are smaller so you can try different dishes. Would definitely recommend others to go here and will be bringing my parents here on the next visit
Amazing tapas dining! Some of the best food we've had on the strip. Great wine selection with very knowledgable servers. Will def go back!! Try the lamb!
Come for: white ceviche, tuna cones, scallops, creamy risotto, potato bravas, chicken croquettas, apple foie gras, strip steak, seafood paella, paella Serrano. . Skip: crab and avocado, short ribs, ox tail, artichokes, baby back ribs. . Great service. All their food is solid thigh if I had limited choices, I would follow the list I mentioned. The only thing I wish they cooked their paella a little more so that the rice can get a nice crisp.
Incredible and outstanding. Every plate we ordered was delicious. Service was on point. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas. Don't miss out.
Solid effort here in Aria.  The sommelier here is particularly amazing.  . . All the dishes here are pretty good, with my favorites being the short ribs and the fried potatoes.  Paella here is decent, but definitely not authentic.  It lacks the crispy bottom, except for the very edges.  . . However, what is really noteworthy is the sommelier here can recommend you some excellent Spanish whites and reds are very good prices.  You will so better with the wines price wise than drinking sangria, especially since you are getting cheap reds with the sangria.  . . Ask for wine recommendations here.  The food is pretty good, but definitely come here for the wine.  Lastly, excellent service!  Just a wonderful and bubbly staff.
**Review for Restaurant Week 2014**. The 3 course lunch for $20.14 was solid.  We had the lobster gazpacho which was refreshing and perfect for August.  The lobster was a lowlight in the soup.  The texture just seemed off to me but the flavor of the soup was amazing.. I had the salmon which was a small portion but could not have been cooked any more perfectly with the crispy skin and buttery flesh.  My dining partner had the rib eye which was depressingly small and came with french fries that weren't terribly exciting but were cooked just right.  For dessert they ran out of the cake option so we both had flan which was good but I bet the cake would have been better.
I very rarely give any place one star but this was an extremely disappointing dining experience. If it wasn't for it being restaurant week I definitely would have complained. But the proceeds were going to three square so I held my tongue. Let's start with the cheese platter my friend and I ordered... I'm no cheese expert but I have had my fair share of cheeses and actually have tried a few at different tapas restaurants. I kid you not I'm pretty sure the cheeses on this so called "Spanish cheese platter" were Brie, Swiss, Parmesan and some blue cheese. One small piece each at $16! Oh also, when the server dropped off our dishes, he didn't explain anything to us. Didn't bother to let us know the ingredients or describe the dishes to us whatsoever. My lobster gazpacho was just ok. Nothing bad but nothing special. Let's move onto my main course, crispy chicken... More like chicken fingers that had no seasoning and overly salty potato and chorizo on the bottom. Terrible. My friends pork chop was way over cooked. It was like eating jerky. The chocolate molten cake was good, the only thing good from the whole meal. If you want good tapas in Vegas... Go to Jaleo, hands down way better and worth the price.
Went with my fellow vegetarian beau for our first night in Vegas. The atmosphere was entertaining all by itself and the staff consistently helpful. After being told the mushroom soup could be prepared vegetarian, we proceeded to eat the most cozy mushroom soup ever. If you need Thanksgiving without Thanksgiving, go for the mushroom soup.  The marinated olives are probably the best olives I've ever eaten, and I snacked on them throughout the rest of the meal (also, I've never had a pickled garlic clove but those were delicious to eat whole, what's the secret?) The sauteed baby spinach was a bit mushy and wet for my taste and the asparagus nothing to write home about. The stuffed peppers were great.. . For dessert we got churros and Santiago's cake. I wish I could have had four scoops of the ice cream they put on that cake. The churros were just a pretty-good vehicle for the AMAZING spicy chocolate. Could have taken home a vat of that chocolate.. . The virgin sangria was refreshing as heck.
Our meal at Julian Serrano was fantastic. We were seated immediately with our 5:30 reservation, and the restaurant was pretty crowded by the time we left at 7pm. My wife and I had 7 different small plates, and all of them were good. As others have mentioned I wouldn't say I was exactly stuffed for our $150 tab, but everything we had was meticulously prepared and tasted great.. . Ahi Tempura - Fantastic! Perfectly red Ahi tuna with a very light tempura breading, just enough to give it a bit of a crunch. The avocado puree under the tuna, combined with the seaweed salad was amazing. 5 / 5. . Padron Peppers - Never had these before, and they were incredible. Crispy, light, and reminded me of eating green pepper flavored string potatoes. Not spicy at all as I originally expected but still excellent. I could eat plates and plates of these. 5 / 5. . Iberian Sliders - More like a two bite burger. Flavorful and salty because of the ham. Up until this arrived all we had were basically appetizers so this dish gave our meal some "weight". 4 / 5. . Creamy Mushroom Risotto - Very good, risotto had a bit of crunch to it. Manchego cheese added saltiness to it. About as good as risotto I've had elsewhere. Next time I'll try something different instead of getting this again. 3 / 5. . Goat cheese and sweet marmalade cake - This was fantastic. Very creatively constructed. Looked like a little work of art. 5 / 5. . Dessert was the churro with chocolate sauce - about the sum of it's parts. Chocolate sauce had a bit of a spicy pepper bite to it. 3 / 5  . . Service was great, drinks were decent, wine list was pretty good as well. Next time, I'll try out the paellas and some of the seafood tapas.
So we got a $50 daily food and beverage credit from the Aria daily.  We went twice and loved it both times.. . We had the Mix Paella.  It was full of lobster, mussels, shrimp, and chorizo.  It was cooked magnificently.  The saffron flavor came through.  It was a little small though for 2 people.. . The next time we went we had the Serrano Paella.  This paella had morcilla, baby back ribs, baby kale, & saffron rice.  The morcilla was flavorful.  And the ribs were so tender.  I never thought about adding kale to a paella.  But it worked.. . Finally we had the Chocolate Molten Cake.  Damn, it was so good!  The chocolate oozed out of the inside and was so delectable.  . . This is a very good place.  The next time we go we will try all of the tapas.
