Today is my birthday.... BTW!!! Hint hint. If you see me on the strip tonight? Don't be shy. I accept drinks as a birthday present supplement! Anyway this hotel is great we love it here. Always a great place to relax, party or just sleep! The pool is fun it's shallow so no way anyone can drown. Come have a drink with us!!!!
Perfect place to stay when in Vegas for business. I used to come to Vegas at least once a month for my prior job and each time I would stay here. It is nonsmoking and non casino which is really nice after long work days in the craziness of Vegas. I always felt comfortable and safe here, being mostly alone at night and having to walk to my room, etc. Rooms are nice and sort of set up like a studio apartment, i'm pretty sure they actually rent them out as apartments as well. It is right in the City Center so walking distance to Aria (should you want to gamble), Crystals (should you want to shop) and has a walk way to Bellagio for all the Bellagio has to offer. Prices here are good too, very reasonable compared to other places on the strip.
On a last minute trip to Vegas for EDC, we were left scrambling for last minute accommodations during the second busiest weekend of the year.  With luck on our side, we were able to secure a room at the Vdara through a corporate discount, resulting in a deal that I didn't even think was possible at a nice hotel in Vegas during a summer weekend.  The rooms looked great on Yelp and I was just thrilled to not be staying at Circus Circus again, miles away from anything butthe scorching Vegas heat.. . Upon arrival, we were greeted with complimentary valet, perfect for someone who cannot stand the concept of valets (me!).  We then went inside where we experienced possibly the simplest check-in I have experienced in my life.  Despite being about 4 hours early for check in time, we were able to be checked in right away and immediately went upstairs, where we called to have our luggage brought up.  The room was spectacular, with the queen-sized pull out couch possibly more comfortable than our bed (not a knock on our bed).  Spacious, a mini kitchen, reading lights by the bed, a seated shower, nice tub, expansive bathroom.  What more could you ask for!. . The lobby had a nice bar, where the bartenders remembered our drink orders after the first visit.  The pool was also enjoyable and not as crowded as those at some of the casino hotels, in which you question if you are swimming in a higher percentage of water or sweat.  The fact that it is a non-gaming hotel makes it a little less crazy as others and the location makes it easy to get to anything you need situated about 30 seconds from the Vdara and a walkway away from the Bellagio.  Being in the middle of the strip was also very convenient, allowing us to get wherever we needed with ease.. . All in all a great experience, and further punctuated by the fact that they were very accommodating in allowing us to extend our stay, despite initially being full that day.
As far as Hotels go in Las Vegas it doesn't get much better than this.  My girlfriend comes to LV on a regular basis and she stays here a lot.   This is one of my favorite Hotels.  You need to make sure that you select the right type of hotel for your visit.  We like Vdara for a variety of reasons but here are a few that stand out; 1-most important the rooms are amazing and we always get a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains, 2-no smoking and 3-it is dog friendly.  Sure it's not a Casino Hotel, but with Aria just across the way or the Cosmopolitan it's not that bad.  The bartenders are great and very personable.
This is absolutely the only place my partner and I will stay in Vegas.  Using the mlife discount, the price is incredible for what you get.  There is no casino in the hotel, but there is a walkway to Bellagio and on the other side Aria is just a short walk away.  The hotel is also non-smoking, which we also enjoy.  Nice to get some fresh air after walking through the other casinos.. . The rooms are incredibly spacious.  We personally always get the Vdara Suite since it comes with an extra half-bathroom, but is less expensive than the other bigger suites (which only come with 1 bathroom).  We haven't encountered any loud people/parties going on, which is always nice when you're trying to go to bed early or sleep in late.  Love that a full kitchen comes with the room with complimentary water and coffee, and we're always using the fridge and the microwave.  Just fyi, some suites are way more spacious than others (our first stay had a much larger bathroom, living room, and bedroom, but our second stay had a room near the top of the building so it had a better view).. . During our last trip we rented a cabana and it was a great experience.  The pool area gets really hot because of the reflection off of the hotel, so we alternated between using the dipping pool and laying out in our cabana.  Staff was incredibly friendly, and I was so comfortable I ended up napping most of the day.. . This might not be the right place for you if you don't plan on staying in your room for long, and if you enjoy having a casino in your hotel.  For us, however, this hotel is absolutely perfect for just relaxing and unwinding and we wouldn't go anywhere else.
Absolutely beautiful hotel. Very tastefully decorated and a very upscale vibe. It's in a great location ( it's in a complex called CityCenter ), next to the Aria and Bellagio. It takes pets, it is non smoking, and it's non gaming. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is spotless. The views practically can't be bad, as there are no views of the less-desirable I-15 side. Pool is nice and service is very friendly. Definitely the new go-to vegas stay. The one issue is that the sofa bed isn't terribly comfortable. Loved!!!!
I really wanted to love this place, and there are many positive things to say about it, but it's just imperfectly good.. . Vdara is in the Citycenter, and it's a little bit away from the Strip --- to get to the Strip, your best best is to go through Aria or the Bellagio.  The Cosmopolitan is very close by, but there's no direct walkway/path --- I had to go take the stairs outside, then walk into the parking driveway of Cosmo.. . Got in around 10am and dropped off my bag at the bellhop, since the room wasn't available until around 2.  Very convenient feature of having my bag delivered to my room after checking in.. . Room is nice and spacious.  Had a higher-level floor with a slight view of the Bellagio fountains and overlooking the pool area.  Free wifi as well (hear that, Total Rewards hotels?)  BIG negative was that the room wasn't 100% clean --- keycards and an empty bottle of water from the previous occupants were still on the kitchentable, and there was an unwrapped (presumably used) bar of soap in the bathroom.  And there were only regular bath towels (no hand or wash towels) in the room.. . The staff is very friendly and even the security guards at the elevator banks were nice enough.. . Some more negatives: the Market Cafe and the Starbucks were always understaffed --- almost always had long lines, particularly the Starbucks that only had one barista both mornings.  Ordered the chicken and waffles from the cafe and it was very salty.  Service was fast.  Didn't check out the bar but it was nice.  Also, the outside seating area looked very unappealing --- I wouldn't want to hang out there, even though the pictures on the website look nice.  No one was on the cushioned swings the entire time I was there.. . So this place is really 4.5 stars, but just short of 5.  But I'd definitely go here again.
First trip to Vegas and this was a perfect place to stay. The vibe is very relaxed, no casino and no smoking is a HUGE plus! The staff is friendly and attentive and very accommodating. Sign up for MLife before you arrive...we got a big discount on a Cirque show because of it. Three small downsides...not deal breakers though. The free wi-fi is terrible, unless you are very comfortable with your travel companion you may be a bit put off by the placement of the toilet and the pool is small and often crowded. On the plus side, it is an awesome location connected to the Bellagio and Aria, no smoking or casino and the rooms are clean and very comfortable. We had a city corner view. Highly recommended.
We just spent the last week in Vegas for three birthdays (significant other and friends). We checked into the Vdara on Tuesday. The lady at the reception desk was perfectly pleasant yet seemed highly indifferent to our special occasions. Nothing was offered to help us celebrate, even at an additional cost. . . Upon arriving in our room, we perused and noticed that the room is plenty spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable. We were somewhat disappointed that the format of the room is not the same at all as they were shown online. It had rained the day before our arrival and our rooms windows were quite filthy and spotty as a result. While our view was of the interstate, and nothing special, it still served as a distraction. Also, having a kitchenette with no flatware or dishes unless you specially request them is completely absurd. . . The $28 a day resort fee covers the internet and two free bottles of water a day, unless they don't clean your room every day like we experienced. Then you're faced with needing to call back down and request something that should already be in your room, like a plate or a fork. . . The hotel offers very light amenities, such as a Starbucks and a small cafe. It helps keep the place nice and mellow from the hustle and bustle but also ensures that you have to venture out to other hotels for most needs. . . All in all it was a mixed bag.
I really liked this place it is really cool, modern, super comfortable room or mini condo I should say. The bed, was super soft and humongous. I could lay there  doing a laying down jumping jack and my fiance still had room to sleep. So comfy beds I slept without waking up at all to anything, even the sun beaming through the window.. . Oh, the windows are sooo cool. This super modern room has one of those window curtain things where you push a button...and the curtains raise and shut by themselves, like automatically. So cool, loved it. In this condo, the sofa turned into a bed and there are two tv's, everything is really top notch great quality.. . The bathroom is beautiful and ultra modern chic. There was also a mini kitchenette and a little dinette table. Just really modern, nice, comfortable studio. I was on the 52nd floor and had a great view of the strip, the Bellagio fountains, High Roller, Paris Eiffel Tower, and a little of Ceasars.. . The only reason i didn't give the place 5 stars was because i thought the pool was a little small and crowded. that's all.. . PS: there is no casino this is a really quite chill place to take a break from Vegas. Although, it is super close to everything and you can take the train around City Center to Monte Carlo and the Bellagio.
Complimentary valet! Check in was superb! It smells absolutely like heaven once you enter the hotel. The staff is so helpful. My boyfriend and always book the city corner suite because the room is like our own swanky condo. It is beautiful, modern, and feels so big! The mattress makes you feel like your on a freakn marshmallow! I called about a week before we went to ask for a high room to see the Bellagio fountains and of course they helped and we were set on the 46th floor. It isn't on the strip but its just a small walk, I mean its Vegas why not! Aria is a small walk away with a casino and Crystals which is full of phenomenal art structures and fancy shops. The maids were so sweet, we did tip them just like everyone else lol. But even if they didn't get tipped they are always so sweet and personal with us. They request you ask for the robes now which isn't that bad because you can ask for which ones you prefer. They have a starbucks now, but its pretty pricey and the pastries are an extra three bucks. However my boyfriend and I are always spoiled at Vdara because this is the only hotel worth its rates and the hotel rooms are all beautiful. . . . . The only thing is if your checking in with a debit card they take out an additional 100 dollars for security of some sorts for them until you leave then they refund your money.
My 3rd time staying here and the service is still incredible. The staff is friendly and attentive. My husband thought he lost his sunglasses and we had no problems from the front counter to the security guard help us try and find them. They were in his travel bag the whole time but none the less thank you guys for making us feel we covered all based before giving up. We also like the easy in and out of the hotel as well as there is no big casino you have to walk through.
We arrived at the hotel and they gave us only two big towels, nothing else. When we asked for more towels and more blankets, they asked how many people were in the room. It was so annoying. Anyways, the hotel is cheap and the service was bad.
stayed here on 2 different occasions.  . PROS. I love how quiet and low key it was.  Rooms are comfy, love the separate living area and kitchenette going on.  If you know your way around vegas (we drive around a lot to shop and visit friends/family) - this is a great home base.   We hardly ever saw any guests around either.  Pool is small - but there weren't ANY kids!  We got lucky.. . CONS. I didn't like waiting to checkin, because there was 1 girl working and 15 people in line.. but we got over it as soon as we had out room key in hand.  I know they have a bar near the lobby - but skip it.
I stayed two night in Vdara, and I had a unpleasant experience here. The first day we checked in Vdara, I took a nap on the bed. After a while, I felt one of my leg was itchy and I lifted the quilt, and found there were some black spots peppered on the sheet. I was shocked, because I didn't expected the hotel like Vdara would make such mistake. I called the housing keeping instantly and asked for changing the sheet. Then I asked the manager to come as well, the African American manager took a picture and said he would report it, and would compensate us for that. Yet, two days latter, I still didn't hear back from Vdara. :( It seems like Vdara is not value about customer experience. not recommended.
My group got upgraded from our original suite to the hospitality suite so my review will encompass that experience. . . The Vdara gives you a great sense of luxury and comfort from the very start. The hotel offers free valet and we gave the bell hop's all our luggage including drinks and food and they brought it up to the rooms on their own. . . The room itself was extremely spacious. We fit a group of 9 into the space with ease. Anything we needed was brought up. From silverware to cleaning. . . The rooms were cleaned in the morning and again touched up around 6 pm. This ensured that we never ran out of supplies. . . The beds were extremely comfortable and each living space offered a separate climate control. Bath was large enough for our larger males to use with comfort. At the end of the trip this hotel offered complimentary limo service back to the airport. . . I found several deals on Groupon for similar rooms. Would come back. Downside is no on site casino,  but Aria is within 3 minutes of walking from the front desk.
I first of all must state that i am a bit of a hotel snob. I found this place to be absolutely wonderful! Perfect location on the strip just next to the Bellagio and centrally located. We stayed in a Delux Suite on the 25th floor and had amazing views  and a partial view of the Bellagio Fountain. The bed was extremely comfortable and the soaking tub, kitchenette and small living room was perfect. Although it was just my boyfriend and I who stayed... It would be perfect for a small family. The couch in the living room pulls out and turns into a bed. There is one TV in the bedroom and one in the Livingroom as well. We paid 169 per night which included the taxes and resort fee.  Also... we had to call for some more towels to be delivered... housekeeping had them to our door within 5 minutes. Great service. . Another great thing... is that the hotel is really quiet. There is not a casino in this hotel and there is a nice little cafe and also a bar downstairs. I would stay here again...especially for the price.
The rooms are amazing at the vdara for the price, the trouble comeswhen dealing with guest services.  They are pretentious across the board and really unpleasant outside of trained politeness.. . Compulsory 18% gratuity on 200$ cabana rentals (not just the service/food/drinks but *everything*) is ridiculous and the staff act like they know it.  You're giving a ~40$ tip for the honor of paying 200$ for a few lawn chairs and a tent (and couple waters and and apple or two also).. . Pros:  The rooms are amazing for the price and you are in the heart of everything south strip.. . Cons:  The pool is crowded  on busy days and the staff is insufferable.  Just the initial dealing with cabana reservations was a very off-putting experience.. . Any billing issues seem to be handled by some call center the service is even worse there.  Most of the answers to simple questions are "what would you like me to do for you", repeated as a reply instead of a genuine question.
Great slightly off the strip non smoking hotel without a casino.  We got upgraded from a one bedroom suite to 1,600 square feet suite with two master bedrooms, full size kitchen washer and dryer, living room, guest bathroom and walk-in closet. It was by far the most luxurious stay I have had in Vegas. It reminded me of the Park Hyatt hotel in Tokyo which was featured in a Bill Murray film.  The clientele of the hotel is more sophisticated and business like.  . . There is a Starbucks, bar, and quick grab and go place downstairs.  Going to the strip requires going through the Bellagio or the Metropolitan.  Bring comfortable shoes.  It will be quite a walk. . . Maid service was great. They neatly arranged our toiletries and even put some in the drawer.. . I would stay here again. The hotel is a nice retreat from the glitz and glamour of Vegas.
