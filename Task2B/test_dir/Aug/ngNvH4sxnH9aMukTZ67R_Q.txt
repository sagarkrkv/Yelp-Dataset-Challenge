Prime awsome crab and shrimp in mounds food from around the world dessert never stops all fresh and good place seats 733 people and is in a wait
If you're doing the 24 hour buffet pass or not (but you should be) you just have to go here!! It's the best one in my opinion. Their dinner is simply awesome! My friends and I usually just go to rio for the entire 24 hour pass. They don't have a breakfast last time we went but we usually are not up that early anyways. Apart from the food selection, they have pretty good desert, especially the ice cream!!! It's yummy in your tummy! It's a must go to!!!
There was so many varieties.  That is probably the best thing about this place.  I never got the same thing twice,  except the deep fried scallops.  I was full about half way during my time here.  The food wasn't super amaze balls,  but it was great. A lot of the items were cooked very well and had very good seasonings.  Our server was attentive and courteous the whole time we were there and asnwered all our questions.  Plus free champagne via groupon!
Love coming here! They have a variety of food to pick from. It's a bit pricey but if you come in for dinner get here when it's still lunch to get a cheaper price!
Amazing food so high quality and so many varieties. I especially enjoy the breakfast buffet.
Excellent food...taste and abundant!! Though the line could be a bit long they seat you pretty fast and dependent on the group size. All levels of the wait staff are attentive and very pleasant!!
This place has seriously gone downhill. My family and I tried food from every single section and none of us were even remotely happy with the food. The meats were overcooked and almost everything we tasted was bland. Hoping this place would redeem itself with the flashy desserts section, we all tried someone different. Nope. Also horrible. I asked my husband what he thought of the cheesecake and he said, "It tastes like nothing, there is no flavor whatsoever". The servers are very nice, but that is the only redeeming quality of this overpriced, barely mediocre meal. DO NOT waste your money here.
Well we waited in line for this buffet for about 1hr and 45 mins. And when we finally got to the front with only 1 party ahead of us I'm guessing the manager and older white man named Art made us go to a different line and told me and my wife it would be faster. Well that was a LIE because the line we got sent to took us an additional 15-20mins waiting in. And about 6 party's that were behind us were able to get seated before us in the line we were previously in. Art pissed off a lot of people that night because all the parties behind us were saying the same thing. Good thing our server was a good guy. The food was good. I wish there was more warm crab legs instead of cold. Just a warning to anyone to who goes to this buffet don't listen to Art if he tries moving you lines.
The seafood buffet -- O M G.  I think I might have eaten 182 crab legs.  So many choices, all of them delicious.  If you're in Vegas, this dinner is a must!!
Over the years, this buffet has gone from being the best now to the worst. I've been going to the carnival world buffet since 2003. In 2003, they left me with an unforgettable experience and the food was really yummy. I went back to the buffet in 2008 and it was by far still really good food. Then doing the recession they offered Locals 50 percent off and it used to be a really great value. I would go once a week since it was only 12.99 for dinner. However, I noticed in 2012, they started cutting back on the desserts, the food quality starting becoming tasteless and cold, and the price went up. Recently, this year its no longer 50 percent for a local if you have a gold total rewards card. It's only a 25 percent discount and its now 35 dollars for 2 adult locals for lunch. It's way overpriced for cold, low endless food. The pastries are barely there and mainly just a few fruit pies and gelato. This used to be my favorite buffet but now I will never go back after the experience I have had this year with the food tasting bad. i noticed different managers were working there now than the managers in 2012. If they bring back the carnival world buffet like it were in 2008, then I would go once a week and pay the extra fee, but to me its not worth it. The chefs do not care about the way the food is cooked and I think the food is just being reheated and nothing is cooked homemade. They produce cheap low end ingredients and make you pay for a high priced buffet.
