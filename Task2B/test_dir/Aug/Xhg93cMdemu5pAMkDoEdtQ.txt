Of course the atmosphere here is wayyy better than in NYC.. definitely dine outside! The food is different than the NYC location.. we got burgers and fries and I prefer the New York food for sure. Not that it was bad, just not as tasty IMO. We split the original fro-ho which was good as usual. This location has a much broader fro-ho selection which sounded amazing (like amaretto!) but I had to stick with the original. I also think the dessert tastes better in New York, but again, not terrible. They also have alcohol, so we got birthday cake shots. Waiter was very nice. I'll probably be back next time I'm in Vegas because it's a fun environment & the food is fun but for the most part just average :)
Just ok nothing special
Horrible service today, 8/2/14, around 5:30pm. We waited a long time in line because the person taking orders was pretty leisurely about it. But the WORST was the 30 minute wIt for a corn dog and French fries!! Everyone ordering ice cream sundaes gets served first by the same cook the makes the food like hamburgers and for dogs as well! We were #27 and ice ream orders in the high 30's were being Called while we were still waiting. Worst thing is when I saw our food up and they still didn't call our #. Stay away. Not worth waiting half hour in 100+ degree heat.
LOVE the deep fried oreo sunday. A must every time we visit vegas.
Great atmosphere, especially if you're sitting outside!  You get a great view of the strip, and the decor is fun in a cute candyshop kind of way :). . Food is decent, however the prices are obviously high considering its prime location in front of Caesars'.  Sandwiches/hot dog are ENORMOUS. The famous Frozen Hot Chocolate is delicious and also ENORMOUS (and also $$$). I got mine with fresh berries and it was pretty yummers!. . My 2 complaints about this place are as follows:. 1. Uber slow service.....like incredibly, mind-numbingly SLOW. I've been here twice, and both times the service has been snail-paced. . 2. Bathroom is outside around the corner somewhere, and it's kinda gross...
we stopped in after dinner and everyone ordered something different so we could all try, I am a HUGE fan of just a Hot Fudge Sundae, let me say I licked the bowl and plate for this is by far the best Hot Fudge I have ever had!!!. wish we had one in Huntington Beach Cali
Frozen Hot Chocolate = Bomb! The Filipino lady working the front area = not so nice.... But what do you expect from tourist destinations!
Deserts are fantastic and you should really come here for the deserts, literally any of them are delicious. The food itself isn't that amazing so eating there isn't really worth the price. Go for the deserts!
Deeply disappointed in the food & drink, but the waiter was terrific!. . Pros:. - Terrific waiter, really on top of things.  Nice guy, too.. - Location, right in front of Caesar's Palace. . Cons:. - Food quality:  My hamburger sliders were severely undercooked, so much that I had to ask for the manager, and I have done that less than 5 times in 25 years.  To his credit he did not charge me for the sliders (they were a health hazard) and gave us a 20% discount for the poor kitchen performance. . - Speed of the kitchen:  The restaurant was not terribly busy, yet still our order took more than 30 minutes to arrive.  . - Drink quality:  Mixed drinks were weak and expensive.  My wife had a $14 basic, frozen margarita and she couldn't taste the tequila.  I had a $10 basic bourbon & water, and it was weak, too.  . - Prices: You pay for convenient location on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace.  A $14 house frozen margarita?  Come on.   . . Overall:  . My whole family was deeply disappointed in this experience.  We paid $102 for a basic dinner for a family of five, and that includes no charge for the raw slider hamburgers, a 20% discount for the rest of the bill, and a 20% tip for the waiter for his terrific service.  The manager was nice, and did not push back at all once he saw the raw sliders, so I appreciate his response.   I have had worse.  Still, I was disappointed.  So was my family.
Overindulgence at its best! Before going big, talk it over with your dinning partner. Portions are big enough to share. This includes the fishbowl drinks. Come hungry and sober and it guaranteed to leave this place feeling totally opposite of either of those feelings. You've been learnt.
After asking the server about the food here my husband and I decided to share everything! It's all about big portions here and loud music. Good selections of music by the way. . . Appetizer: nachos- they were good, with an odd hint of lime that made it complete. After getting down on a few my husband found plastic in her mouth. A big piece too, I'm just glad she didn't choke. . . Lunch: the famous steak sandwich- it had 3 sunny side up eggs that made it good. If the steak was a thinner and the eggs weren't over cooked it would have been phenomenal. . . Dessert: deep fried snickers sundae- this sundae over flowed with peanut butter and chocolate sauce. The candy them selves we're dipped in cocoa puff cereal and deep fried. Such a good way to get fat and be happy.. . By the end of our lunch, our waiter took care of our dessert, gave us a free signature dessert, and took off the appetizer. He gave us an experience the owner would be proud of. We'd come back.
Fun!
If you're looking for a spectacular meal, this is not the place for you. However, the dessert is amazing and worth the experience. The menu items excluding dessert are hit or miss but the dessert never disappoints. I went with my family a few days ago and we ordered the treasure chest for dessert- not a small feat but absolutely delicious and great for sharing with a large party.
The meal was quite good, but the frozen hot chocolate is a bit overrated and prices overall are out of line with the food. Portions are typical to large (by American standards), but I can have similar food elsewhere for about 2/3rds the cost. Yeah, yeah, it's Caesars, but we're talking $14 for a cold hot chocolate with ice chunks (c'mon, your blender can certainly do a better job than that!). Kids loved it, though!
I LOVE the original Serendipity in NYC and when they opened this LV outpost I Had to drag my friends here on the last couple LV trips to try the infamous frozen hot chocolate. . . Well, the hot chocolate and all the food is as yummy as I remember but I have to say the service at this outpost is always lacking. I've been 3 or so times and it's always super super slow, and to some degree I can't blame the waiter staff cuz they all seem to be working their tail off but it's almost like they are just always understaffed. I seriously think they need to re-evaluate their staffing needs cuz the place is almost always full and the service is always like this. . . So basically.. I would still go back and suggest you go, even if just once, to try the amazing frozen hot chocolate but just go at a time when you aren't in a hurry or in a bad mood. ;) . . Hint: they take reservations and I highly suggest you make one cuz otherwise the wait to be seated can be really long.
Meh... My experience here back in June with friends wasn't that pleasant. We got seated a few minutes after I checked in since I made reservations for me and friends. I ordered the Mint Frozen Hot Chocolate and it was okay. Our food twas taking forever to arrive and we've noticed that the tables surrounding us that were seated maybe 20 minutes after us got their food before we did. We found out that our server didn't even put our order in so we sat on our table literally waiting for nothing. We all got irritated and told our server to cancel our order and left. I guess at least I got to taste the frozen hot chocolate but whatevs.
It's really sad reading all these reviews... Ppl say food was excellent and service was great but it was expensive and leave only 1 star. Problem with Yelp right there... . . This place is amazing, every time I go to Vegas, I eat here a couple of times. Yes, sometimes they are crazy busy but they handle it well. Food never disappoints. Drinks are expensive... But in case you didn't know, you are in Las Vegas. . . I think there's a Denny's down the street if price is an issue.
I like to bring myniece here. It's a fun place, especially if you can sit outside on the deck. Little kids love it. I've always had good waiters and waitresses but sometimes the service is very, very sloooow. The sandwiches are very good and the deserts are amazing, but nothing here is cheap so expect to pay around $100 for just 2 or 3 people.
Food will not knock your socks off. Food borders on ordinary to bland. Frozen beverages taste like flavored sugar. Definitely over rated. Plus place is always packed!
Really good place to cure your hangover. Lots of sweets and deep fried food to relieve a crazy night in vegas. Only thing is its a bit pricey...but who cares in vegas! Definitely worth trying.
Diner food at Las Vegas prices... THANK GOD FOR GROUPON! The service was fine, we sat at the bar. The food was eh' okay. My partners burger was raw, but that was quickly remedied. The giant, get fat in one sitting, ice cream thing we had was a bit much, but what the hell, we were in Vegas. Go for the dessert, skip the meal.
Mediocre. We came here wanting to have an ice cream on the strip and eat outside to people-watch in a cheerful-looking place. We were told there was a 20-minute wait, so we went out back to their to-go line. I tried to order a root beer float, but they told me I could only order that in the restaurant, although they had it on tap outside. My husband tried to order an Oreo sundae, but they were out of Oreos, and just about everything else on the menu other than a couple items. Must be good, you think? Not so much. They charged us $1 each for tap water and $12+ for the sundae. I had to wait so long for the ice cream that my tap water was empty by the time my food was ready. I asked them for a refill of tap water, and they said they can't do that; I must have given the eyebrow because she agreed to do it this once... For a mediocre $12 sundae and $3 worth of tap water, one would hope they could refill a TAP WATER. The ice cream wasn't even good enough to hold my five-year-old's interest. They no longer have the fish tank featured on Tanked, either. This place is not up to Las Vegas strip standards.
If you want desert this is the place to go, I didnt' lol, I was thre for someone elses bday lunch. I actually ordered the hot wings which were really awesome. . . The frozen hot chocolate, IMO - over rated. Its yummy but the flavor was nothing new.
We went on Sunday at around 11 and there was no wait. I think we got a little lucky because the place packed up a bit afterwards. The wait for the food was a bit too long though and no, it was not because we were hungry. . . I shared the breakfast burger with my friend. It was really good! We went with medium rare for the patty and it was the perfect texture and taste for us. The burger comes with potatoes and a pickle which were also pretty good. One of our friends ordered the chicken and waffle and the portion was very big. I tried it and the waffle was too dough-y for me but the chicken was pretty good. I am not a big fan of fried foods so I would never order that. For dessert, we ordered the frozen hot chocolate of course because of the hype. It was good but I would probably not order it again for $12. I feel like I can make something similar at home. . . The decor inside and outside of the restaurant was very pretty and the waitress was extremely nice. We loved her.
Huge disappointment! About $12 for a frozen hot chocolate, my two kids and wife threw away at least half of each of theirs. My daughter ate the whipped cream and took about two drinks and said she really didn't like it an it was the Oreo flavor, kids trashing Oreos clearly means it's no good. For all the folks thinking about stopping in just skip it. Sugar factory in the Mirage is way better and there are several other locations on the strip that I am sure would be far superior.
Mocha double frozen hot chocolate rocked my daughters world
I am done ordering food here, I will stick with the hot chocolate. We have eaten here a dozen or so times in the last few years and never had good service. Our orders always have at least one error, the service is SLOOOOOOOW - like painfully slow, and the food just isn't amazing. I get it, its a tourist place, but still, at least it could come out the right temperature. . This most recent trip, we sat for 20 minutes before I finally asked a server if he could find out who our server was. Then he never came back so I asked another one. He asked around and said apparently no one was, so he would be happy to help me. What the heck?? . . So go for the frozen hot chocolate, when you have some serious time to spare, and bring a board game, or novel to read.
Again a mediocre experience. I have no complaints whatsoever about the food. The food is great. The service is iffy. I had a friend in town from Texas who wanted to go to a restaurant where we could eat outside so I suggested Serendipity. I made a reservation ahead of time because the previous time I was here, the wait time was ridiculous mid-week. I called about 2 hours prior and made a reservation for 2 with a request for a patio table. The hostess let me know that it was based on availability, which I understand but at the same time if I'm asking to reserve it then I should get it, no? Anyway we get there and the host re-confirms that we would like a patio seat and said that it would be about a 10 minute wait. He walks away and another hostess takes over. 10-15 minutes rolls by and we are still not seated so I asked the hostess nicely to check on the status of our table. She says we're one party away from being seated. The hostess asks the party ahead of us (whom arrived after we did with NO reservation) if they want outdoor or indoor seating, and of course they say outdoor so she seats them on the patio. The hostess calls my party next to be seated, and immediately she looks down and says, "oh you wanted outdoor? It's going to be another 10 minute wait. Do you want to stay inside?" We had already waited 20 minutes WITH a reservation so we just agreed to stay inside.. . To eat I had a cheeseburger well-done with fries and red sangria to drink. My friend had the crab cake sandwich and white sangria to drink. She also got the carrot cake sundae. The food is the business LOL. Like I said, no complaints about the food besides the fact that it's pricy but hey you pay for a great location, good food, and huge portions. Plus it's LAS VEGAS. If you're not ready to drop some cash, it's not your city. Sorry to say.  The waiter was just okay. Not really engaged, didn't tell us about the happy hour or anything on the menu really, which I feel is important since this is a tourist restaurant and not a regular for locals either. If you really want to see what all the hype is about as far as their food, just take it to go and eat out front. We should've went to Sugar Factory!
One word will do Overrated. Expensive and very cramped too.  Will not be coming back i've had way better tasting ice cream and shakes at other local spots.  Save your money and go sowhere else.
Our waitress was great
Wasn't impressed with the food I the restaurant...save your money by ordering your Frozen Chocolate at the outside window and lounge in the outdoor cabana tent. The Frozen drinks are a yummy break from the alcoholic beverages. My favorite is the white chocolate...it's piled high with whipped cream and white chocolate flakes sprinkled on top. It's expensive...but worth it. I ate in the restaurant and the server was super! She talked me out of a certain dish with her honest opinion of it...and made recommendations of others. She didn't write anyone's order down and that was impressive. The food was mediocre and overpriced. I'll stick with ordering just the frozen drinks and skip the unnecessarily long line for the food.
I ordered a cheese burger and cole slaw. Burger was flavorful and had great presentation. The cole slaw was ok at best. Go with fries. Onion rings are huge and little greasy. Overall great place to get a good burger and enjoy the strip while you eat. Sitting on the strip is a must!
so rich and delicious, couldn't even finish it.
THIS PLACE IS BEYOND AMAZING!!! From the service to the food I have nothing but raving reviews!!!! We came in for my sister's birthday and ordered the onion rings which were phenomenal and a perfect size! Each of us got a meal and the portion was large, but extremely delicious!!! We all ate each other's because each plate was out if this world!! And let's not forget the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!!! It was too die for!!! We definitely will be back and I'm definitely recommending this place toeveryone!! Thank you for a wonderful experience!!!
Been here a couple times and am never that impressed by the food. Maybe solely because of the strip prices but the salad and pasta did not disappoint and dessert was HUGE. Nice place for a fun night out if I'm already out by the strip, but would not go out of my way.
I was only there for Frozen hot chocolate, and I regretted. HORRIBLE - pure  water with chocolate powder and crushed ice ... and the regular size charged me $ 17.00, a fortune for this....I DON'T RECOMMEND  to anyone ...
Frozen hot chocolate, quite a concept, just the right thing for a 100 degree day in Vegas.  I would say it was all it was cracked up to be.  Plenty for 2 to share.  Pizza was pretty good too and the outdoor bar with view of the Strip was a nice way to spend an afternoon
This was my last stop during my Las Vegas trip because I really wanted to try their famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. That did not disappoint. I would give 3 and a half stars if I could, but the three will suffice.. . It was a Friday afternoon, and the restaurant was not busy to my surprise. All we wanted was dessert, and we had decided to get the hot chocolate and some sundae with cake in it. The waitress did not come until about 10 minutes after we were seated, but that was understandable because she was waiting on about 5 or so tables. We ordered when the waitress finally came, and the waiting game began again. The sundae and frozen hot chocolate did not come for almost 20 minutes.  People who ordered AFTER us, who were ordering meals, got their food before we got ours.. . The wait was really bad for the amount of people there that day. Maybe they're just understaffed, who knows? But to top it all off, I noticed that my fork (which I did not need to use, since I was getting dessert) was still clearly dirty. I probably will just order Frozen Hot Chocolate to go next time and won't be dining here again.
Awful. I've frequented the Serendipity's in New York many times and this location is nowhere near in comparison. To start, we had to wait at least 15 minutes on a weekday at 2pm for two people. There were plenty of empty tables inside and outside. The problem seemed to be that they lacked enough staff to actually clear and clean the tables as soon as patrons left.. . While we waited for our table, we stood outside and perished the menu posted on the wall. Was looking forward to trying their sundae with the humble pie. As soon as we sit down inside and look at the menu, we realize the menu isn't the same. I asked the waiter where the sundae was on the menu and he tells me that they don't make humble pie anymore and that the menu outside is old and they haven't bothered to change it.. . Disappointed, I order a cookie sundae and my friend orders the frozen hot chocolate - something she had been looking to try the whole trip.. . The deserts come quickly. Her dessert is much smaller than the one they have in NYC. My sundae is mediocre. Basically just cookie dough ice cream and a cookie. 5 minutes after serving our desserts, our waiter comes and drops off the bill basically preventing us from ordering anything else.. . Needless to say I won't be frequenting this location again. It's not worth the hype - nothing like the movie. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale would definitely not approve!
This place is always packed and the prices are pretty expensive. I don't really get the hype about this place. Yes, the frozen hot chocolate is good but the food in general isn't anything special.
Need a sweet treat in the early hours? This is the place to stop! I recommend the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate.
This place is a piece of crap!!! The service is slow an the food is awful this was my third visit and every time the service and food kept getting worse! Management there is a joke they don't know their head from their ass let alone how to manage a restaurant.
The service takes forever... But they are nice... Obviously you must get the Frozen Hot Chocolate... Get it girrrrrrrrrrl
The food here tastes like food you could get at Fridays or Chilis or any American chain restaurant but for double the price .. I got the crabcake sandwich or burger or something, and thought it was kind of dry and over cooked. The buffalo wings were delicious, but you really can't go wrong with it since it just tastes like buffalo sauce .. . . I ordered the almond frozen hot chocolate to go, but the waiter brought it to me in the bowl thing. While it was admittedly beautiful served as it was, you realize that it only fills up like 3/4 of a tall starbucks cup when they transfer it and take off the huge amount of whipped cream! For 11 dollars???? What?? It was good but sososososo sweet. But good if you have the sweetest tooth of life (me).. . Anyway the food was solid enough and still remains one of the more affordable dine in restaurants on the strip ............. I cry saying that since I was crying at the check. *cries*
Love the burger called 1/2 Angus Burger... Of course no egg i did add avocado, still delicious great customer service. I am coming back for more hoping i can taste the whole menu. Clean place. Love how the place is decorated its open and great to come in to eat.
I went to the grab and go window.. . 1 star for the service, 2.5 for the food.. . They don't serve hot food before 11:30am, cashier was kind of rushy and impolite, and didn't let me order nachos--even though it was 11:25am.. . She didn't even register all the items we wanted to order.. . Food:. The donut is big and Ok.. The frozen hot chocolate is meh.. . Not bad if there's nothing else around, but not really worth $17.. . I'll probably avoid this place in the future.
Just as many claim it is indeed a diner with diner food. Sometimes it breaks my heart that there are a hundred better places in Vegas but way slower because of the location or the fame game. It's like any restaurant on the strip will do.
Food pretty good and service not bad. Made a pretty good AMF that I enjoyed. . Food portions are HUGE. You can order one thing and share it.
This review is for the grab and go section only.  My friends and I ordered 2 banana splits. They were 12 bucks each. Not only did they take 20 min to give is our banana splits... When we received them they were melted and dripping everywhere. And dripped on our clothes.. . They seemed understaffed in the kitchen section.. . But come on.. Don't give me melted ice cream when I dropped 12 bucks on it. . And at least apologize... Don't just hand it to me and act like I ordered melted ice cream. . . I hate leaving bad reviews, but this was just unacceptable.
The food was great. We came at twelve forty and had a ten minute wait. My guy was annoyed because there were tables open and the one he said we were going to get that had been open the entire time was the one we got. I got a groupon that included two salads, two burgers, and a frozzen hot chocolate to share. Got offered water while we waited for the waitress which took about ten minutes. When she came we ordered the burgers with the salad. The salads sit on the side of the hot plate ready to grab and go. We sat for thirty minutes waiting for the salads. We got our burgers from the food runner when she stopped and asked if we had gotten our salads. So she brought mine and replaced my guys with an extra order of sweet potato fires on the house since he didn't want the salad since the burger was right there. As soon as se got the fries (two minutes) she asked to take my salad away. I just let her since it seemed like it was a big deal for me to eat that and my fries. I looked at my burger and noticed they forgot my avocado I orders on the cheese burger. Had to stop the food runner to get it. While we were half way threw the fries the waitress came back and asked if we were ready to have her put in dessert. we agrees. She came fast with the dessert and check and requested to take the fries. Since I had the groupon I only had to pay for the extra things like drinks and add on to the burger. Free refills but the soda is five bucks. I put my card in and had the check standing up while we eat dessert since I only had a ten and felt bad if I only gave a two dollar tip. even though my guy thinks any tip was to much since he has worked in the past as a dish runner to head waiter in high school to college.But no one came to get the card and the place at this point was basically empty since it was almost two and lunch rush was over.  So they got the bill I had and we left. . The food was amazing. Looks just like the picture. The burgers taste great and I loved the regular fries. If it wasn't for the waiting staff being so non attentive and rushing I would have given it five stars.
It's okay...I think it's a little on the pricy side but the portion is pretty generous - need to share!! The onion rings are pretty good!
Frozen Hot Chocolate Yum Yum!!!
Awesome place for a Sunday hangover cure/brunch. On a Sunday around 1, there was a long wait, so we sat at the bar with no wait. The bartenders were very polite and helpful. We shared an omelette meal and it was the perfect amount for the 2 of us. Love the atmosphere and decor!
Here for breakfast. Food is great. Service is excellent. THANKS TO Barbara. Good job! :-)
Stopped here for lunch , they were empty tables all around but was told that there was a wait , so we had to sit at the bar , I ordered the nachos and by the time my food  came to the table the cheese was cold and the beans didn't taste fresh . But my friends ordered the pizza which was good , and my other friend ordered a burger which was really good ! So next time I know what to order !
Came here just for the frozen hot chocolate. The serving for two is perfect to share. The other couple we were with thought it was too sweet, but my boyfriend and I love sweets so we finished it haha. . . From what I saw other tables ordering, I wouldn't come here for food. It just looks like typical American diner food from Denny's. . . The restaurant smelled like cheese which kind of grossed me out, but it was too hot to sit outside. . . Kinda overpriced for a drink ($14 I think), but nice to say you've tried it. Probably won't be back since there are other places on my Vegas list to check off.
This place is a joke. Dont come here for food. My girlfriend got a deal on groupon (no good can come from Groupon) and wanted to go there for breakfeast. We both got omelets,  both were over cooked and rubber. Both also came with a side of potatoes that were so burnt and chewy they were almost inedible.. This place must only exist for desserts,  which we didn't wanna try after our below average breakfast.. Like i said, This place is a joke. Charge 18 bucks for a omlete, but dont know how to cook an egg. Even with the groupon i feel over charged.
I've been here a handful of times and I'm never really wowed by the food. It's mainly over priced diner food with ridiculously large portions. The dessert is pretty good. . Service is decent, when I was here last night our server wasn't really checking on us as frequently as we wanted. It's decent...but never my first choice. . You should try this place at least once though. If you love desserts then you'll enjoy it.
Terrible customer service! Walked out! Waitress was rude! If I could I would give zero stars!
The food was amazing! We went on Sunday 8/17/14 before our flight back home. They wait wasnt long which was a surprise. Our waiter was friendly. The food was good. I wasnt expecting such big portions! I was so full i didnt get any dessert! Thats what they are known for. The frozen hot chocolate. I guess this means i will be making another Vegas trip soon!!
The double frozen hot chocolate is awesome.
So much food on your plate... So much poor service.. We had a reservation for four for breakfast thinking that the place would be busy and there were five other tables actively dining and starting the day.  We saw our server twice and that was only for three seconds, total.. What could have been a great experience was soured by the in attentiveness to our beverage glasses and table.  Not worth the your time... Grab a bite elsewhere while in Vegas.
Make a reservation! This is my first time being here and I will say that the service is really good. The lady was really accommodating.. . Now to the food, I got the chicken and waffles and I'll say that the portions were pretty good, however the chicken was alittle salty and my friend got the egg Benedict and it was REALLY small. Overall this is a decent place, alittle overpriced but it is Vegas..
On a hot summer day in vegas, you would want...no you NEED to get a frozen hot chocolate! It just had a taste that I cant describe! Yummm
