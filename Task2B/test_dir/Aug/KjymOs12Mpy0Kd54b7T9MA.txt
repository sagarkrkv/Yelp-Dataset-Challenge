Olives is a very nice restaurant bar that is located in the Bellagio.  . . I think they can get pretty busy here during peak dining hours so I would encourage you to make a reservation.  We did so using OpenTable.. . Olives has indoor seating as well as patio seating.  You can also choose to sit by the bar.  The indoor area is very relaxing with little overhead lighting letting the natural light from the patio serves as the main source.  The outdoor area is great as well seating around 10 or so groups/tables.  There were large parties as well as just couples dining outside.  This is probably the best place to eat as you will be able to see the Bellagio Fountain Show during dinner.  This area is kept very cool with umbrellas and misters throughout.  . . I would say this place is pretty formal in terms of attire.. . The menu and service here are great with a nice selection of flatbreads.  They provide you with a drink and dessert menu that is presented through an iPad.  A very modern way of dining and a definite need at more venues.  Service was prompt but not overbearing allowing us to dine at our own pace.  You are served bread and olives while selecting what you would like to eat.  I had the flatbread and it was really good and refreshingly light. . . I would suggest coming here for a nice dinner or even for a few drinks at the bar with its great selection and appetizing bites.
A nice setting with great views of the fountain but the food? Meh.. . The good: the beef carpaccio appetizer was enormous. Never seen anything like it. Tasty but definitely meant to be shared. . . The OK: the mushroom pasta is 'highly recommended' according to the server. Tasty but over cooked, came out as more of tasty, flat noodled goo. . . The bad: octopus and squid appetizer. Made with hummus so the char taste of the grilled octopus mixed with the hummus produces a bitter, off putting flavor. Watery, not particularly visually appealing. Note I order grilled octopus wherever possible. I love it and this is not up to standards. . . So many great dining options in Vegas. Skip this one
We came here based on Yelp reviews, and the fact that we were staying at the Bellagio resort. We made a reservation with the concierge and were accomodated for an 8:30 sitting. We were escorted to the table and thought the room looked nice albeit dark. We sat down and started to chat but could hardly hear each other. The restaurant was very busy and the noise was down to the full house as well as the hard walls and tile floor. The hostess gave us two menus and an ipad. No explanation but basically figured the ipad was the wine list and menu pics etc. the server checked in and asked if we would like to start with some wine, I said that we werent sure what we were going to eat so would need some time before our wine choice. BIG MISTAKE, at least 20 minutes passed before we saw him again, we were on minute three of our 5 minute countdown to walking out. We ordered the carpaccio, the mushroom tagliatelle and the gnocci and a bottle of Layer Cake. The carpaccio arrived and it was as advertised, delicious. We also got some tappenade but I just don't get the white chocolate scone as an accompanyment. We again waited for what seemed a very long time for the remnants of the carpaccio to be taken away. And then we waited, and waited. the table next to us who came in while we were ordering recieved their appy and entree and were deciding about desert while our server announced that the kitchen would be plating our pasta momentarily. I would have complained directly to this guy but he was a ghost. A different person was continually dropping off our food or refilling our water. Once the pasta arrived , the gnocci was fine, nothing special, and the mushroom pasta was well over cooked, mushy and stuck together, at the quality check we actually mentioned that its was just Ok, but no reaction. Bottome line? don't bother
Amazing restaurant at the Bellagio!!!! Food was second to none.  Definitely worth the money!!!
Solid... and tasty.  Great experience sitting on the patio with good food, drink, and the Bellagio fountains.. . I'm tempted to reduce by one star because Todd English wasn't there for us.  Chef... how could you do that to us?  Ha ha ha.. . I've been wanting to eat here for a long time.  And now that we did I am pleased to have had a totally good experience.
So glad that we ate here! Everything was amazing, from the view, the drinks, the food, and the service!! Because of the reviews, we had the beef carpaccio, and it was wonderful! My husband and I had never eaten it before, and we both loved it! I had the butternut squash pasta, and my husband had the scallops - both second to none! We've eaten at many high end restaurants, and this was just such a fun atmosphere! Make sure to request to sit on the patio - the Bellagio fountains make the experience! So wonderful and so romantic! Will definitely be dining here during our next Vegas trip!
First time - pleasant ! Daringly sat outside in the middle of summer knowing the heat but it wasn't too bad. Started with the watermelon/arugula salad and hummus both of them were good and perfect sizes. Entree was butternut squash pasta and the gnocchi with pesto? I believe . Everything was great and came out fairly quick. Prices weren't as pricey and I thought. It was also my birthday so they gave a commently dessert not sure what it was but it was kind! I'd go back
definitely one of the better restaurants i have eaten at on the Strip.  eating out on the patio is a treat.  i have been here a few times for various events, and the food can be inconsistent, so i can definitely understand if other people have had more of the "meh" experience.
Olives lived up to everything we hoped it would be. The food, drinks and ambiance were perfect. We had the cheese and meat board to start which were great. The Gnocchi and Fig and Prosciutto flat bread were to die for! Add the view of the fountains and it's perfect!
Went for a late dinner with reservations at 9pm, needed to wait an extra hour to sit outside and we did. Just walked around and had a cocktail at a lounge. Absolutely loved the view and show!. The service was great and the food was amazing!. We decided on the three course prix fix for $55 and added the wine pairing for an additional $20 each. The oysters were okay, but the fish and steak entrees were mouth watering. We had tiramisu for dessert and it was very good too. You get a separate type of wine for each course, well worth the $20. Overall, wonderful evening
I didn't actually get to eat here.. . I had reservations.  I wanted to sit on the patio.  I checked in and told the waitress that I wanted to sit on the patio and I was willing to wait however long it would take and she said no, absolutely not possible.  Even if I'm willing to wait 2,3,4+ hours?  No, it's impossible, she states.  I just left.  I was so looking forward to that dinner but it didn't happen.  Disappointed.
I started with a $15 mojito at the bar. And then I elected the prix fixe dinner menu for $55. I regretted the latter decision. Although the starter two oysters were fresh, they were tiny, and I could tell from that that the rest of my meal would be unsatisfyingly small in portion. And indeed it was! My steak was probably only 6-8 oz. and was extremely dry and somewhat chewy and charred. But the sauce was good, though it didn't do enough to cover up the char. Lastly, the sorbet dessert was disappointing because the texture was that of dying-sorbet-making-machine-frozen-yogurt. . . But.. The service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely patient while we perused the menu, and even helped us out when we overheard us discussing how to obtain show tickets. He was sincere and kind, and frequently returned to our table to make sure everything was going well.. And the beef carpaccio was amazing. I was extremely apprehensive about eating raw beef, but I worried to no avail. The beef was thinly sliced, spread atop a bed of cornbread and spring greens, and sprinkled with prosciutto. Just amazing.. The patio view is great, too. You can watch the fountain show while having dinner--how often do you get to do that?
Great dining experience every part of our dining experience was wavelength from appetizer to main course . Paul our server was courteous and superb .. We have stayed at Bellagio many times and this was our first time at Olives.. It will be one of our must eat places when next we visit .
I love Olives and I try to dine there as much as possible. I reccomend the patio seating because it faces the fountains and you have a lovely view during dinner. Everything from the bread to the olive tapenade is amazing. Their drink menu is featured in an Ipad. I had the double pear martini and it was perfect. The beef carpaccio is amazing. I almost ate half of it myself. I still haven't tried a better beef carpaccio than the one from Olives. My ricotta ravioli was perfection. This is a good place for a date because the lights are dim and it has a very romantic vibe to it.
I gave this restaurant a 2 stars for many reasons. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday thinking it would be a great experience since its looks romantic sitting next to the Bellagio fountains and eating outside on an August night . We unfortunately were seated inside (which is understandable since the outside was so busy), but I was the only one who could see the fountains from my seat and my boyfriend barely could get a glimpse of them. I know they can't guarantee a window seat or outside seating but just the fact that they didn't try despite my request that I made with my reservation was frustrating. The service was OK nothing too special. The tables are super close to each other (less than arms length) and it is very noisy. So not romantic! There were 3 different people who had wine glasses fall off their tables and break (seems to be quite the often occurrence). In fact the tables are so close to each other that I got elbowed in the head by the waitress serving the table next to us! I was very disappointed because it was nothing like I pictured it, don't let the dim lighting, candles at every table and the 'view' of the fountains fool you.. it is not a place for a quiet romantic dinner!
Made a reservation for 7:15 and requested balcony seating. Arrived and lady was pretty dismissive saying they sat all seats outside and it would be over an hour before one opens up, then turned and walked away before we can finish speaking to her. . . . The wait doesnt really bother me as much  as the dismissive attitude of the hostess. Also be warned, apparently reservations dont mean much for balcony seating.. . . Update after meal : Paul was a great server and the service by the wait team was great. The food was good as always. mac and cheese was delicious, scallops and risotto was good but scallops were on the over seasoned side, and the Tuscany flat bread was nice. The carpaccio is a very well balanced dish. Steak and lobster was a little forgettable but all in all great meal.
We went for a late dinner reservation 9pm, as many other reviewers seemed to have a better experience later in the evening. We had requested to sit outside, but were told it would be hours more to wait for a table outside, so we sat inside. Our server was fine, but we were near some kind of server station and on two separate occasions glasses were dropped and flying pieces of glass came all around us, not quite the atmosphere you would expect from a nice restaurant, one server even asked for our help to find the broken pieces of glass. The food was unremarkable. We started with a Fig & Prosciutto flat bread, which was fine but nothing special. I had the salmon which was by far the best main course at our table, however it was drenched in butter so it was very rich and I could not finish it. The butternut squash tortellini was shaped nothing like tortellini but more like cannelloni and lacked taste completely.I don't even remember what the men at the table had. The also had a photographer going around the restaurant snapping pictures, which reminded me of a cheesy cruise ship. The photographer was asking $45 for the pictures she took and rolled her eyes when we said we were not interested. I also saw the photographer run out of the restaurant and down the shopping plaza after a couple who had finished their dinner, but apparently not seen their picture yet! The whole photographer situation seemed odd and left a bad taste in my mouth.
We had an 8pm reservation.  Were seated right away and got a balcony seat. Which I had read was difficult to achieve. So we were very pleased about our table! Paul was our waiter, he was personable and efficient!  Plus we really liked him! They need to describe the salads better. The one I chose had prosciutto on the top of the salad and I didn't see that listed in the ingredients.  It could have been there I just didn't notice.  Took it off the top and ate the salad anyway.  My husband had a different salad that was more Mediterranean and he liked it a lot. He ordered the corn ravioli, which he liked but I didn't.  I had a salmon dish that was Amazing!  All in all a very good dining experience.  Plus we had an excellent view of the fountains!
The drinks and service is really good. Get the window or outside seat for good view. I ordered ravioli but it did not taste like a delicacy it tasted like frozen ravioli.
This was the most disappointing meal during our visit in Vegas last week.. . We visited the place and it was packed. So, we made reservation for three days later.. This place is way overated !!!. . There was nothing worth mentioning. . We cordered mushroom pappardelle and sea bass.. Nothing stood out other than the price. For the price, location, and hype, I expected something more. . . The cocktails were okay. I ordered three pears and the sling. #15 per drink. Not much alcohol in them. more like fruit juice. . . The service was friendly thought. The waitress was very pleasant.. But toward the end of the meal, you can sense they want you out because people are waiting outside... . overated ! hype! . Didn't live up to my expectation for a Bellagio Vegas experience.
I ran into this restaurant on accident. I was skeptical to try it out considering how much I hate olives but I must say the food was amazing. Very tasteful! . . The Bloody Mary was to die for. I also got to see  glimpse of the bellagio water show! . . I will be coming back  for sure!
Food is terrific. Patio, fountain seating is limited,  so get there early and call to reserve.  Ask for closest to the fountain seats. If you like rare the steak tartar and tuna tartar are fabulous.  They take food alergias seriously,  just ask and even the bread selection will be accomodated. by far the tastiest,  most tender pork chop I've had.
