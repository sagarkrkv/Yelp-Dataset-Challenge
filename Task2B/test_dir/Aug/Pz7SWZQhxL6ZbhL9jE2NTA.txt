First of all I spoke with Tram Tran, who was very helpful getting me abs my large party to decide MIX was one of our must hit clubs while in Vegas and I am so glad. . . The place is amazing. The views are breathtaking. The drinks are delicious. There is a patio that's just insane. We had a great time.
Amazing dinner. The staff was so attentive and the food is incredible. Add the stunning views (even from the bathroom!) and you can't go wrong here.  For the service, location, and food the pricing wasn't too bad.
I travel to Vegas for work a lot, and this is by far, my favorite bar on the strip!  It's never too crowded, the drinks are awesome, and the views... breathtaking!  I esp like the bathrooms... how often are you happy to sit in a stall, doing your business with a full wall of windows overlooking the skyline right in front of you???
Had a couple of drinks here on a Sunday night. Seating was fast. Orders were on point. And must say at night it's one of Vegas most beautiful views. I like the place because it was more of lounge vibe versus a night club scene. Definitely will visit again.
Well I wasn't sure if I should have chose 3 or 4 stars. I chose 4 for the view and the surroundings. The steak was good. But our table was soooo small. Wouldn't fit more than 2 plates at a time. So we couldn't have appetizer and main dish at the same time. The bread was cold and the side dishes were so so.
Came here on a Sunday night for a romantic dinner. Loved the views and decor! White and clean ! Staff was excellent though our server was a bit stiff and not as friendly as the others. Ordered the Wagyu and lamb. Both were excellent! Dinner with wine was $110.  . We also ate in the lounge area and tried the braised beef tacos and ahi tartar. Highly recommend the tacos!
This place has an amazing view of the strip. The service is great and at sunset (around 7pm) they give everyone a free glass of champagne to cheer to sundown. I'm giving less than perfect because I do think it's a bit overpriced, and also I've noticed throughout the years that they are allowing people in with shorts and sandals which, in a way, kills the ambiance of the amazing view and decor.
Love this place. The view, atmosphere, service and food were phenomenal. Prefix menu came with lots of compliments from the chef as well. On point, probably one of the best restaurants in vegas... and the bathrooms in the back are a definite bonus.
I love Mix. I've been there twice to both nightclub area at night and the restaurant area during the early evening. I just visited the nightclub, didn't actually party there. As others have said, at night, you need bottle service to sit outside. Seemed to be hopping' though. I recently visited again and ate at Mix. I made reservations through OpenTable but didn't need to. We got there right at 6 and the place was nearly empty. I believe it had just opened. We were seated immediately. Apparently you can actually eat outside in the restaurant area but it too hot that day according to a sign on the door. I guess they don't want 105 degree air entering the restaurant every 30 seconds. People were walking out there though, just not eating out there. Later in the night when it's busier they probably wouldn't allow that. I haven't been in the girls bathroom but heard the view is the best of any bathroom hands down. The food was good. Pricey but good. Service was prompt. Everyone was friendly. Not a single bad thing to say. A must visit, especially if you're staying in Mandalay Bay/ Delano.
The view is Ahhhh~mazing! Located at the top floor of the Mandalay Casino tower perched just above the Luxor's diamond in the sky you get an absolutely breath taking view of the city lights. The ambiance and decor are quite lovely and Really, that's all ya get. . . The DJ is hit or miss ( I really wanted to ask the DJ if it was part of the job to keep the dance floor clean & clear and under control,) the crowd consisted of middle/late aged middle class white folk and the bartenders are slow, lack personality and don't even have their looks to fall back on. Drinks were so-so, nothing worth the $15.00 for a rum & redbull. Prepare to be robbed blind.. . Granted it was a Wednesday night, but I was under the impression that Vegas was on point 24/7. Perhaps they didn't get the memo.. . 3 stars for great locale/concept but the execution/promotion could use some help.. . Our group arrived with 4men & 2women and we brought the party.
Enjoyed a couple of beers on the balcony on a slow summer night. I wouldn't come here to dance but I would come back to just kick back with good company, breathe in the desert air, and marvel at the beautiful skyline.
Worst upscale restaurant in vegas.  I went with my wife and another couple.  We love great food and have tried many of the great restaurants in vegas.  This is definitely not one of them.  Our friends ordered steaks which were mediocre at best.  I had the halibut which was dry and had no flavor.  I switched it for the salmon which was dry and also had no flavor.  It didn't end there.  We got the mac and cheese which tasted like kraft easy mac mixed with chopped pieces of deli ham.  The mashed potatoes were chalky and bland.  Im really not sure how you screw up mashed potatoes that badly.  I could have done better blindfolded.  Finally, my wife had the lobster, which was just ok, not great.  Overall, the ambience is amazing, but the food just flat out sucks.  To make matters worse, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy.  Las Vegas has too many outstanding restaurants to waste time and money with this place, especially for the price! I will never go back to this place, or to another one of Ducasse's restaurants for that matter.
