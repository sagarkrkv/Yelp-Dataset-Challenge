The Signature at MGM Grand is okay.  We arrived Tuesday at about 7:30 P.M. and left Thursday at 11:00 A.M.  I liked the room, the bed, the spaciousness, and the bathroom.  The TV worked perfectly Tuesday night, but come Wednesday it was not working correctly whether I used the remote or the TV buttons to turn on the TV, and change the channel or the volume.  If I pressed the volume button it would change the channel and vice versa.  If I pressed the power button it would turn on and then turn off.  I called the front desk and they did a soft reboot on the TV and it improved for a couple of hours.  One of the men came up that was working on the reboot and asked how it was working, and at the time it was working fine.  But later that night it was back to being glitchy.  The shower is spacious and easy to adjust to the right temperature.  Tuesday night we used room service and the food was a 2 out of 5 stars.  The chicken wrap was good and fresh, but the croutons on the salad were stale.  My son had the chicken noodle soup, which he liked, but I tasted it and it was very salty.  He also had the French Dip and he didn't like it.  The rolls that came with dinner were not fresh and the one I tasted was stale.. . Housekeeping is prompt.  We needed more towels Wednesday night and they brought them up quickly.  All of the employees at The Signature were nice.  We didn't use the pool at The Signature.. . We were in Tower 3, which is far from the MGM Grand and the action and grand pool complex.  I wonder if the food at the MGM Grand is fresher than the food at The Signature Tower 3?. . I won't be back to The Signature.
One bedroom penthouse suite 32nd floor in tower one was amazing! Great view of MGM grand pools & city. Very clean & quiet. Ordered room service at midnight for an 8:30 am delivery- on time and was great. Had a wonderful two nights there and would recommend everyone to stay at the MGM Grand Signature.
Great place to stay at. A little pricey with their $25 a day resort fee. Quiet, just off the strip. The pools look like they'd be quiet and relaxing, away from the madness at MGM but it's just as crazy and loud. That's Vegas for ya. Staff is friendly and helpful, good location and access to all MGM's amenities. I would stay again
This hotel experience could have turned into a complete nightmare, but thanks to the staff, it became a awesome experience.  First, I pre-checked into a room in tower 1, floor 30, right around 7:30 AM.  Since I couldn't check in until 3:00 PM officially, I walked around the strip and I waited for a phone call from the MGM Signature as promised.  When I did not get a phone call and is it was around 3:30 PM, I decided to call them directly and was told that my room was finally ready.  When I got back to the hotel and finally checked in, the room was an absolute nightmare.  The room was not clean, there was garbage everywhere, the bathrooms were dirty, and the bedroom TV was broke- the prior guests were there for the bodybuilding expo and left everything from their syringes to clothes in the room.  To say that I was livid is an understatement.  However, when I called and spoke to the folks on the phone, they moved me from tower 1 to tower 2, 17th floor, so I had to take all of my luggage to the lobby, and get new room keys.  By this time I was upset but willing to work with the hotel.  The change in rooms was day and night.  The new room had a full view of the strip.  The room was completely clean and smelled great.  With that being stated,  I accidentally left some personal effects in the old room so when I went back to tower 1, I saw the staff trying to clean up the mess and much to their dismay, they found out that the TV was broke in the master bedroom after I told them- poor folks. . . All of the staff were absolutely the kindest people you could find in Las Vegas- I never ran into anyone working there who did not appear to love their job to the fullest.  . . With that being said, I need to tell you that if you are adverse to walking- this is not the property for you.  However, I could make the walk from the hotel to the casino in 10 minutes which was fine by me.  Another thing- you can use the main MGM pools plus the MGM signature pools- although the signature pools are smaller, they are less crowded, and much closer to the hotel.  . . Remember if you require drinking glasses- you must request this from front desk staff, otherwise, they will leave you with one glass.  If you ask for anything, they will deliver.  . . Although I don't know if I will ever return to Vegas, I can say if I do- I am staying at the MGM Signature again.  If you book through Southwest Airlines, they even give you a resort credit- mine was $75.00 and it paid off really nice at the MGM buffet.
Unfortunately as soon as we arrived there was nothing but problems.  We checked in at the front desk with a woman who happened to be the manager on staff.  The 1st room keyshe gave us didn't work, the second room key did work, but the room she gave us was already occupied!! The second room they provided us with was still not ours, finally the 3rd room was correct.  The manager offered us a $75 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience.. . The woman who was helping us check out spoke to us as if we were dumb, trying to charge us an extra $200.  They never provided us with the $75 food and beverage credit and they tried charging us double for the resort fee.  The woman went over the bill multiple times being very rude as if I was dumb for not understanding why the bill was so high.  I paid the entire bill before we arrived to the hotel so this wouldn't happen.  The front desk staff obviously needs better training and needs to check their attitude towards their guests.  . . . Regarding the hotel and 1 bedroom suite we stayed in for 2 nights, it was great.  As you pull into the casino drive way it is gated to keep other people out who are not staying there.  We had 4 girls in the room and it was so helpful to have 2 full bathrooms. The hotel did not have a casino inside which made it really quick and easy to get in and out.  There is an indoor walk way from the Signature Suites to the MGM.
Family friendly resort......kind of far to get to the strip. Pretty sure the valet stole my sunglasses.....my fault for leaving it in the car.....ugh!
Hands down the best hotel experience I have ever encountered.. . They don't meet expectations, they exceed them. . . Vacations are hard earned and we deserve the best when on one, you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to stay at the MGM Signature at least once !
I just returned from a 3 night stay here with my family.  We stayed on the 32nd floor in a 1 bedroom suite.  We were pretty happy with the size of the suite and the two bathrooms.  It is a bit farther from the strip and the hustle and bustle of the strip - which can be a pro and a con.  I liked that the walk to the MGM property was all indoors.  We stayed Sun through Wed so it wasn't very crowded which was a huge pro, in my opinion.  There are two things that annoyed me enough to knock it down a couple stars.  First, when I realized that we only got 4 bath towels I called housekeeping to request an extra towel.  It was after hours so I'm not sure who I spoke to, I don't think it was actually any one in housekeeping, and was told that they strictly only give out 4 towels and that I could switch out a used towel for a fresh one.  Uhh, seriously?  I've never stayed in a hotel so stingy about their towels.  My friend's family checked in the next day and also requested extra towels and had no problems getting them.  Second, the pool area is lined with marble.  What genius thought of that?!  Marble + water = slippery!  People were falling left and right.  During a couple hour span that we spent at the pool one morning, I saw at least 6 people slip.  Some more seriously than others.  My friend's son fell and bumped his head (he was fine) and a hotel staff person showed up an hour later (no one from our party reported the fall so I'm not sure who did and why it took so long) asking if he was alright and to ask my friend to fill out a report.  They were pretty aggressive about asking her to fill out the report - she initially didn't want to bother because they wanted pictures of her son.  We also saw an elderly lady slip and fallpretty badly.  :(  I think they need to figure something out before someone has a major injury and they get sued.  So all in all, I wasn't completely displeased with my stay here but I'm not sure I'd stay again.  I might check out some of the other all suites properties in Vegas before coming back.
This is our second stay at The Signature and once again I'm very pleased with the experience.  The first time we rented directly from the owner, while this time we did it through a travel agency, which booked directly to the hotel.  The advantage of doing it with an owner is that you know exactly what you are getting it - we had a better view last time.  But it's much easier and less troublesome to do it directly with the hotel and you get daily maid service included in the price.. . In both cases the rooms were identical, and they are pretty much like they look in pictures  They are both elegant and comfortable.  They are also a bargain, in particular if you are a family and take advantage of the kitchen, at least for breakfast.. My kids particularly like the large jet tub in the bathroom, and the fact that there is a little TV for their use while they bathe. . . The bed is super comfortable as are the pillows, the sofa isn't too bad.  Internet is very fast and there are enough outlets.  There is a table where you can work.. . Service has also been very good.  Their computers were down when we first arrived and the lobby was full of people waiting, so they comped us $75 at The Lounge and helped us find a place to seat and eat.  BTW if you eat there, both the chicken wings ($8) and the flatbread with prosciutto and figs ($10) were excellent, and not overly expensive. . . The only minuses of staying here is that it's far away from the strip and that it has valet parking only.  They are pretty quick in retrieving your car, but it does mean you need to have change to tip.
Amazing location for Las Vegas.  The units are nice but a bit dated.  I love that it's walking distance in the center of the strip.   The pool is gorgeous too! And each tower has their own pool.  There's a nice gym and coffee shop there too.  Fun stay!
Non-existent customer service from the valet, doorman, front desk, room cleaning and security down to the operators and managers. Good rooms but awful in every other way. So much so, I would not return and would recommend that others do the same. Cleaning staff failed to show up one day - left my room wide open all of the next day. Managers could not respond except to say sorry. When you could get a manager through the operator or whether they picked up the phone at all. That's several managers. Just lousy.
Awesome hotel. The staff go out of their way to make your experience enjoyable. My maid found my tangled up necklace and untangled it for me (it was very tangled, and would have taken me forever to fix on my own). Little things like that go a long way.. . I was staying for a week for a work conference, and they made sure I had access to laundry, as well as cutlery and dishware (even pots) in my room. Yes, there's a kitchenette.. . The only downside is that my tower was far from everywhere I needed to be. The MGM is huge, so it comes with the territory.
Snagged a suite here for the weekend with my sweetie from a groupon and from the moment we arrived, I was impressed! From the free valet parking to the complimentary bottled water when checking in, everyone was so attentive and sweet! The room was gorgeous with a brilliant view of the strip. Everything was clean, and it included one if the most amazing bathroom layouts that I've seen! I want it in MY house!! Even when we accidentally locked ourselves out the staff was pleasant and more than willing to help us out. . . My only complaint would be that it's a little far from the strip, but the MGM connects everything so well that it really isn't that big of a deal. I highly recommend staying here, it's a vacationers dream suite!
Love this place. Stayed in February for 4 days and after spending 4 days at Red Rock, I decided I had to write a review to compliment the service and amenities of this hotel. . Pluses: . Clean, nice front desk staff, great kitchenette, spacious, quiet, no smell of smoke because the casinos are down the walkway at the MGM, nice little bar for late night drinks (better if it was open later), good breakfast at the sandwich shop downstairs, convenient casino/restaurants/shopping at the MGM but none of the noise and seediness because the Signature is set apart. Also, reasonably priced even booking through the hotel.. . Minuses:. Would be nice to have a little store with kitchen/breakfast essentials in the hotel to make good use of the kitchenette.. . I just stayed at the Red Rock where the front desk service wasabysmal. When you only have 4 days at a hotel, it makes a big difference when the staff smile and make you feel welcome and try to address concerns efficiently and effectively.
My partner and I stay here every year for business and I highly recommend it.  Close to the strip but no smoking, no gaming and free valet!  Our check in/check out has always been painless no matter which online service (expedia, jetsetter etc) we used.. . Six elevators in each tower makes room for everybody. The rooms are enormous with real doors on the bedroom and bathrooms (both full baths) and a full kitchen with glasses and dishes and a dishwasher!. The master bath is also enormous with a full soaker tub and stand up glass shower. There's a nice table with chairs or a big desk for working with your computer.  Balconies are large and on the upper floors have great views.  I have never heard any noise from adjacent rooms.. . Our room has always been spotless and housekeeping keeps the hallways nice, without piles of room service dishes and dirty linens. It is a bit of a walk to the main MGM casino but it's all indoors and air conditioned. Plus you get a $50 restaurant credit we usually use at Wolfgang Puck. The walk back is good after a big meal.. . The one thing to keep in mind is that with all valet parking plan a little bit ahead. First one ready should head down and turn the ticket in, that way the car will be there when everyone has decided what to wear!
Why did I not stay here before.  I got two rooms, delux balcony on 35th floor, man what a view, great amenaties, two seprate showers, two bathrooms, a large whirlpool tub, good Wi-Fi. Exelent customer service. What problems we had were quickly delt with and comped. Will Definitely stay again. I would suggest joining mlife rewards for booking, and if you like slots, playing myVegas through mlife for free comps.  Ask for your  cooking utinsels when you check in, the don't keep them in the rooms, and they are all real sized, not mini, and very clean.  The T.V. is cool, but not very many channels who realy goes to vegas to watch tv anyway. The Pools are gigantic, and have a lazy river with tons of beds and seating with umbrellas and refreshments all around.  The resort is family friendly too, you have to go through a secure walkway to get to the towers using your keycard from the hotel, keeping outside traffic to a min.. Hardly had to wait for an elevator, and usually it went all the way up no stops. A+ in my book.
After having already left a negative review, and after speaking with the director of operations Mr. Levi Rogers, who assured me that he would personally respond to a conversation and try to make up for the deficiencies in my stay, even Mr. Rogers fell short and was actually unable to even send an email. Apparently the director of operations can't send emails or follow through on his word. As such, it seems relatively clear why his staff has no personal service as well. I guess If I could not follow through on my word with a simple email response, I would probably hide and hang my head in shame too.
Be warned this hotel is not like most Vegas hotels.  The signature is off the beaten path,there are no restaurants open late for food!  Thus, in Room Dining $17 for burger and fries - it was okay.  But there was also a $5 convenience fee added, plus tip!  We dialed up at 8:30 p.m. because the restaurant in tower two closed at 8 p.m., Starbucks in Tower 1 closes at 5 p.m. Regular coffee is $4 and an espresso was $5.50.. . $25 plus tax resort fee is for water/coffee in the room and internet.. Rate $160. . The room itself is fabulous.  I love the kitchen (you have to call housekeeping to get dishes and cookware.  The is ample outlets, a desk with a TV that pops up in the bedroom.  Two closets and safe deposit.. . The bathrooms.  Yes two bathrooms - one with toilet and shower and the other a room with shower and the most amazing of tubs.  Large enough for this big mama and her tall hubby - together!  (If that was TMI sorry - but you'll want to know you can both get in ..... because the pool closes at 8 p.m. too early IMHO and the Big Pool at the Grand closes at .... 5 p.m.! . . Times they have changed.  It feels like inside a mall!  I make my way 15 minuets from tower 3 to greet the slot machines.  Mind you it was lovely inside temp very cool.  Although one day in and I started to really miss fresh moist air.. . I would stay again just for the GREAT mattress, GREAT tub, and the kitchen.  I was able to head over to Sprouts!  Spend $80 on groceries and eat for just about a week - including salads and healthy stuf.. . Drink AS MUCH WAS as you can will in Nevada!
This used to be a stunning hotel.  Unfortunately, it hasn't changed since then.  They seem to be comfortable letting it fall into disrepair and just charge less and less for it.  I remember when this was $350 a night and it is now down to $120 a night pretty easily and I should have known this was for a reason.  They say you pay for your neighbors and this place has gone downhill.  Pot smoking, noisy night, etc.  TVs in the room were spotty, one of the phones didn't work.  It was a great stay regardless, but just know that it certainly is not "signature" anymore.  If I could do it again, I'd just stay at the MGM proper.. . Also, with all of the talk of "free" valet, they do charge an extortion fee, sorry, I mean resort fee which more than covers whatever valet would cost elsewhere.  Few things annoy me more than resort fees.  It is the definition of a hidden fee.. . I love the fact that its connected to the MGM and all of its services and such.
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Just returned from a 4 day stay at the MGM Signature.  We've stayed at the MGM a few times before but chose the Signature because this trip we were bringing the kids along with us and like the fact that the rooms were bigger and away from the smoky casino. When I was researching hotels one of the things that stood out to me on the Signature MGM website was the fact that they had a marketing special offer for a early check in as early as 9am and a late checkout offer as late as 3pm.  I LOVED this offer!  For an additional $20 for the early check in and $20 for the late checkout.  I called the Signature direct to book our stay and told them I wanted the early check in and late checkout.  When I called the night  before to confirm my reservation (which I always do...never want to arrive somewhere only to find they don't have record of your reservation!) they confirmed that I could check in at 9am.  This was great because I planned our flight to arrive in Las Vegas at 9:20am looking forward to having a whole day at the pool and shopping.  Here's where it gets ugly.  We arrive at the Signature at 10am....3 kids and my husband and I.  When I goto the front desk the lady says, sorry ma'am, we don't start check in until 3pm.  I explain that I purchased the early check in for 9am and again she says, sorry ma'am we are still working cleaning rooms from our guests last night.  She seemed to have no knowledge of any type of 'early check in' special that i had purchased.  She says, you can wait and give me your cell number and as soon as a room is available I will call you.  I ask if she has any idea how long it will be and she says, sorry ma'am I don't because housekeeping isn't on the property on this time.  WHAT!? Hands me a few key cards to use the pool and tells me that they have me in a room in Tower 1 but the pool in tower 1 is Adult only so I'll need to use the pools at the other towers....WHAT!  Why would they put our family in tower 1 knowing we have kids.  Whatever.  So we wait in the lobby patiently for 15 minutes.  Not impressed with the first customer service lady that I talked with, I decided to approach another counter agent thinking maybe he'll be more helpful.  WRONG!  Just as bad as the first lady..maybe worse.  As I try to explain the early 9am check in I purchased he says, sorry we're still cleaning rooms from last night and we don't start check in unit 3pm.  Is anyone hearing me?!   I try to explain again my early check in and condescendingly he says, well who did you talk to about that?  I said, it's on your website.  He says well ok I'll have to talk with my manager about that so that they can take it off because we can't guarantee a 9am check in. I said, well I would like to talk to your manager.  He says, no, I said I will let my manager know about your issues.  I said, NO, I would like to speak to your manager myself so I can explain what's going on.  He said, ok fine. He comes back and says my manager will be right with you.  I wait for 15 minutes as I'm watching this manager on her computer.  Doesn't look like she's going to help me anytime soon so I walk over and sit right in front of her on the couch.  FINALLY, she lifts her head up from the computer and says can I help you?  Ugh!  I said yes, I purchased an early check in via your website and I'm being told that you cannot accommodate.  She says, sorry but we don't start check in until 3pm ma'am.  Haven't I heard this before?  These front desk agents just repeat the same line over and over.  I was really hoping to get something different from the Asst. Front Office Manager Ms. Cordero but nope!!  Same thing!  I tell her that I would be much more understanding of the situation if just one of her staff members (including her) would have across more apologetic, helpful, understanding, etc., but not one of them came across this way.  She says I can put a rush on housekeeping and call you when your room is ready that's all she can do for me.  She says she'll need to contact her marketing dept. to explain that they can't accommodate an early 9am check in so the special I purchased shouldn't even be listed.  You know what, Ms. Cordero?  I'm the customer.  I don't care what you need to do to remedy the situation between your front desk and the Marketing Department nor do I need to stand here and listen to YOUR problems.  I want to know what your going to do for ME because my family has booked our airline arrival around your early check in promise.  I ask her, do you have an estimate on when our room will be ready so we can plan if we should go very far?  She says, "sorry I can't give you a time because if we don't meet that time you will be even more upset".  I almost had to laugh at this point.  Seriously?  OH MY GOSH. Finally, I figure let's just get the kids to the pool and try to make the best of this horrible check in situation. Room was ok but based on Customer Service we WON'T be back!!!
Nice hotel. Large rooms. Update rooms. Clean hallways and friendly staff.The valet is convenient compared to other hotels. The pool / lazy river is fun. Only bad the hotel is a little far from the strip. Well worthy it.
The Signature at MGM was, until recently, one of the best secrets and finest all service 5 star condo style hotels in Vegas. We have stayed here many times with and without our kids. We are fans of MGM and M Life properties generally and this was our go to place. This trip, however, it was different and everything has changed.. . The hotel staff are horrendous and could care less about their jobs or the guests experience. They are petulant and entitled. . . The facility is aging and many of the once luxury features are inoperable, outdated, and in need of repair.. . This trip, upon our checking in, we found soiled linens in our room and left over house keeping items strewn around our bathroom. The inefficient and barely effective housekeeping staff was still cleaning nearby rooms at 10pm. Construction started outside our room at 7:30am. Directly in front of our door!!! When we discovered a water leak in our room (next to and under the bed) we had to call down twice to get it looked at. The puddle was so big, we sloshed around when we tried to walk to the washroom. The blower fan they brought up to air dry the 'lake' was less than useful and highly annoying. At one point the elevators to our room had to be closed due to 'an incident'. What a joy trying to get to the 26 floor with our kids. . . On top of all of this, we had several issues with the billing. When we tried to sort it out and get clarification, we were met with standoffish front desk staff who were more concerned about us eating into their freaking lunch break (actually said as much).  . . Sad this has happened, but until new management can get things under control and restore greatness to this hotel, we will be staying elsewhere. So should you.
MGM signature has all the things you could want in a condo-hotel! The rooms are beautiful and the amenities like the Starbucks in the lobby are great!!! Friendly staff as well. It's one of the most affordable high rise condo hotels to buy. Studios units here start in the high 100s and offer some jaw dropping views of the strip! You can live here full time or you can put your unit into the condo hotel program and start making money right away! If you want an investment property that could be your permeant residence don't look anywhere else! Call/txt/email me for showings! Marissa@kingofcondos.net
What an amazing experience this was for my first time in Vegas. I am SO beyond happy that I decided to stay at the Signature. All the staff was very pleasant, the amazing pool was awesome ( they have a lazy river) and I really enjoyed that we were able to cross over to the grand at anytime without going outside. I will definitely be returning to this hotel the next visit I make. . . The tub was absolutely luxurious, the shower was HUGE, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I reserved a deluxe suite and it had everything I could imagine.  A mini fridge/freezer, a toaster, a blender, and a stove top! . . Thank you MGM Signature for an awesome first time experience!
I dont know where to begin. Ill start with customer service how can a hotel this beautiful and elegant hire people that dont care about customer service. Maybe its the managers who dont implement it, but one thing I know when I come to vegas venetian and palazzo go above and beyond for their customers. Second their food wow. I love my chicken wings with ranch. But not waterred down ranch. I ordered chicken tenders with chipotle sauce waterred down. Today I ordered nachos with steak I spent 15 on nachos with over cooked steak and horrible presentation. The server did not ask to change it what do they care about they get a pay check at the end of their shift. I would never come to the signature again big mistake.
