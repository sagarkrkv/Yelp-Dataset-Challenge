I love this place. Everytime I am in LV this is my go to place. Consistent, courteous, and the food is always excellent. Take the time to enjoy the finer things in life at this shindig. Eat some steak.
The service is superb! The food speaks for itself. The filet is one of the best in town!!!! The atmosphere is awesome. Sexy ambience, along with a traditional old fashion setting. Very romantic! . . Don't forgot about the happy hour. It's the best!!!
Excellent food but the service really makes this place top notch.  Also very kid friendly Which was a bit of a surprise ;). Stick to the steaks as they are the best i have tried.
Good food and welcoming servers.
This is the best Steak House in Las Vegas. The staff and service are fantastic. Liz is the best. The VIP martini's are great.
Had dinner here on Sun/10 Aug with a coupla buddies:. - We did a long walk to here from Monte Carlo.  After dinner, we had the staff call us a cab which they did with no complaint.  (Also, they didn't trouble us about our schlubby attire and tacky footwear).. - I had the $49 Prime-Pair Filet, Crab Cake & Side.  I opted for the Del Frisco's salad over the wedge, nothing spectacular.  The crab cake, filet itself, with the side of grilled(?) mushrooms I chose were delicious.  I've been in Vegas 4 years and I wish I had tried this steakhouse sooner (even though it's part of a chain).. - Also got the pineapple infused martini (next to some tables there are massive jars with pineapple wedges marinating in the liquor), I think that was $13/ea.  Tasty.. - My compatriots also enjoyed their meal and we all satiated the appetites we built up making the trek here.
Everything about it was fantastic! From the hostess, to the bartender, to our server and the servers assistant. The food was worth every penny and especially that lemon came for dessert. Big enough for several people but the two of is shared it :3. The delicious jelly beans at the front door gave it that extra special touch. I'll be back!
This is a letter I just emailed to corporate- it should illustrate our horrible service. Let me add a caveat though- the waitstaff was wonderful. Our server was wonderful. I couldn't have been happier about them. The GM on the other hand- needs to find a new job. She should NOT be in customer service. . . (Also, if you are squeamish, please don't read. IE- FOOD POISONING.) . . On August 23rd, I joined my boyfriend and best friend for a celebration dinner at your Las Vegas establishment. We sat down around 6:00pm and our Server Laura was absolutely fantastic. She was friendly, personable and very helpful in finding gluten free options for my boyfriend, who has Celiac's disease. (It also helps that me and my best friend were servers for a collective total of 17 years. She has worked as one for 10 and I was one for 7 years. We know great service when we see it and were happy to have Laura be a part of our celebration for my friend graduating the police academy and her officially becoming a police officer.) . . The only thing my boyfriend and I had that our friend did not was mashed potatoes and scallops. We also ordered one single drink each and drank lots of water. (My friend and I had the VIP and he had a glass of scotch.) I will also point out that while I ordered the scallops, I had one single bite of a fourth of one and ended up giving my boyfriend the rest. While I sometimes like the taste- depending on the texture, it isn't always something I can eat.. . My boyfriend and I had a show we needed to catch. *Mystere* He felt fine the whole entire time at the show but when we left to get our car from valet- he started feeling ill. (This is about 3-4 hours after leaving your restaurant.) We had planned on going out further and enjoying some of the desserts Vegas has, but were forced to head back to our hotel, due to how he was feeling.. . When we  got back to the hotel, he ended up throwing up in the lobby. It was embarrassing and just plain awful. Thankfully he had the foresight to move away from most of the traffic (patrons,) but he still could not hold it in long enough for us to get back to the hotel room. When we finally made our way back to the room, he threw up about 3 more times and was forced to stay by the toilet for a few hours, due to his condition.. . While I understand generally people overeat, eat at a several different places through the course of the day- we did not have that experience that day. We ate breakfast at 9am- which consisted of fruit, granola bars and coffee. Nothing that would have caused the reaction he and eventually I- would be having. We decided it would be wise to call your Las Vegas location the next day- not only to find out if there were other cases, but also to warn your kitchen manager and general manager, since something like food poisoning can be a costly issue. Not only dollar wise, but also reputation wise. . . By Sunday, he was feeling better and while he did have some side pains in his ribcage from retching so violently- he was able to eat small and light things and keep them down. He was having diarrhea and  I - by lunch time- ended up throwing up a few times and also started having diarrhea- which lasted well after our arrival home in Los Angeles. . . When the GM got on the phone- she didn't even apologize really for our experience the night before. Instead, she went into an account of how she served 100-120 scallops that night and not one other person called to inform her of food poisoning. She implied that we must be making things up- or said he must have been dehydrated or drank too much. My boyfriend is from Israel- he knows how to deal with heat and knows to drink plenty of water, which we both had been doing. We also had stayed in our hotel till about 4PM Saturday, which means while most people were out in the heat, we were enjoying a 70 degree hotel room, full of water and cool air. I tried to explain this to the GM and also mention that I was a server for many years and know what to look for with food borne illness. I also know that scallops depending on if they are from Mexico or not- can be contaminated and no amount of cooking will kill the algae that reacts poorly to the stomach lining once digested.. . She did not once accept any sort of responsibility and insisted that it did NOT happen in her restaurant and how dare we accuse her of such a thing. There was no sort of concern whatsoever to your other patrons or any sort of follow up on her part. As a general manager, it is her 100% duty to follow up on the safety of your patrons. If one item is mishandled, even if she doesn't hear from other people- she is still responsible for those who are effected by it. The right thing to do would have been to speak with her kitchen manager and do a full investigation in looking into how things are being handled and even reviewing tapes of the kitchen to ensure no cross contamination occurred.
I'm a huge fan of filet mignon and this place has one of the best filets! ...then there's the pineapple martini that is TO DIE FOR - but be careful they sneak up on you! Sometimes they have specials and you can get this amazing food for a great deal too!
We Came here for steak dinner for a bachelor party.  We read some decent reviews about this.. . Food:  Started with the tuna tartare and the seafood soup.  The soup was delicious however a bit too much pepper seasoned on it.  The tuna tartare was pretty decent with great seasoning and it came with great toasts.  My friend end up ordering the 8z  Filet,  I ordered the Osobuco veal shank. It was decently marinated. However, the Pasta that came with it was completely dry and stuck together.  It was not edible at all.  My friend's filet was cooked perfectly to do medium rare and seasoned well.   We also ordered sauteed spinach, broccoli and sweet potatoes.  They told us was a family size.  But those portions were NOT family size. Barely enough for 2 people.   For the pricing of the sides,  those portion were Not worthy.  But the sides were cooked very well.  Overall, the food was pretty good. But they seem to miss out on some details.  3.5/5. . Service: This Waiter was like a car dealer,  trying to sell every dish that you had questions for.  He was very knowledgeable.   The water boy were attentive and refilled our water consistently. The main waiter kept checking in us to see how we were doing.    It was very good consistence service during a pack dinner time.   4/5. . . Atmosphere:  When I walked in, It smelt like sewer smell.  It almost ruined my appetite.  However the place is very big and split up into sectors.  I like the spacing of the tables to allow people to walk and you cannot hear other table conversation.  It was decorated very well.   3.5/5  . . Overall, I will round it up to give it a 4 due to the consistency of the service and most of the dishes came out to be great.
Great customer service: lemon cake on the house with sweet wine. You have to try lobster macaroni & cheese. Seared tuna, crab cakes were also better than expected!
I typically go for a ribeye, but decided to branch out and try the filet (medium rare). Just amazing. My knife just cut through it like butter and it just melted in my mouth. The beef tasted pretty good. But not as good as a rib eye; the filet doesn't have much fat so it loses out on those flavors.. . For sides we shared the lobster mac & cheese and the mashed sweet potatoes. Both were just great. How I love carbs...
