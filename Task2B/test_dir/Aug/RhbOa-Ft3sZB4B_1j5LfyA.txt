This place was pretty packed for breakfast, but it seems like most breakfast places are. The food was average. French toast was the typical french toast. The omelet was good. I got a mushroom, spinach, tomato, feta cheese omelet. I enjoyed it, but its nothing special. The breakfast burrito failed! . . Avoid the breakfast burrito! The burrito has allthe standards: sausage, potatoes, eggs, cheese, and bell peppers. The flavor of the bell peppers over powers the burrito and the sausages were bland. You cannot taste the sausage bits, and there is little sausage in the burrito to begin with. It's not worth the money.. . Service was friendly, but a bit slow. Mr. Mama's a nice guy, but this place is mediocre.
This place has the most amazing service. The wait isn't so long and even when it is it's worth the wait. Everyone is so sweet. The food is beyond amazing and it's huge portions as well. It's not expensive at all. The pancakes are so fluffy and everything here is so yum. I want to live in LV just to come here hahaha! Luuuuuuv it.
I work across the street and somehow missed this hidden gem. Craving breakfast I looked these guys up on Yelp and ordered my to go order. I had the Cali omelette with has brown, wheat toast and a side of bacon. It was flavorful and very filling. The omelette was on point with the fresh veggies and the hash brows were finished to a perfectly crispy brown. They were still crispy when I got to work after being in the container. I will be ordering from here again soon!
Da Bomb great food good service.  The host was awesome.  Never got his name but a big shot out to that guy.  He did everything he could to make everyone feel comfortable at this small cafe.  For those that get "irritated" at small cafe miscues maybe this isn't for you and that's cool, just more great food and less of a wait for me!
The strip in vegas has EVERYTHING that you don't bother going outside of the strip for anything but thankfully we decided to venture out and came across Mr. Mamas. This place is truly a hidden gem and you would never guess that they sell food there. The place is simple and doesn't have much of decor BUT the FOOD is delish!! I was craving pancakes so I ordered their pancakes with their house fries. YUM YUM YUM!!! The pancakes were so tasty, especially after I drenched them with syrup. I'm glad they don't serve you a tiny cup of syrup.  As for their house fries, they were tasty too and they weren't greasy at all. I also had some eggs, which were good but then again I haven't had bad eggs before. As for the bacon, my friend swore it was the best. I wouldn't know because I don't eat meat. I'm definitely coming back to this spot to try their Cali omelette and their GIANT cinnamon roll with chocolate milk. Did I mention that their prices are GREAT! Inexpensive for  large portions of deliciousness!!!
What is with the super high reviews for this place?! . . The food was SO mediocre and I felt disgusting afterwards. . . Two stars for the large portions and pretty fast service, but I couldn't even finish a quarter of my food. . . I split the chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravey and california omlette.  Everything was super average.  You know when you can tell if a dish is appetizing from the moment you see it? When I saw my chicken fried steak, I knew it was overfried, the quality of meat was NOT good, and the Cali omlette was simply too greasy and just overall Blah.  The biscuits and gravy was huge--and just Not good. . . I can't even get into the specifics about the composition of the dish and the flavors, the meal was not worth the calories and grease.  . . You'd think Vegas would have great bfast joints bc of the amount of hungover people in search for greasy hangover cures, but i was extremely disappointed here. . . The diner coffee and the country fried potatoes were the only good things about this place.
Really liked this place! The food was great and the servers were friendly... If you can, find your way here!
Our favorite breakfast in Vegas!  We have been lucky every time and got a table right away.  When we leave, there is always a waiting list.  The servers are friendly and efficient.  The food is well prepared and really good! I tried the French toast this time - it was fluffy and light. The man at the next table was raving about the pancakes.  If you like a good breakfast served with a smile, try them out!
I am always greeted warmly here!   The food is excellent and the service is wonderful.   My favorite dish is the mamas chicken fried steak and eggs.  My kids love the french toast.  And my wife says the coffee is very good.  We probably come here about oncea week.
Just ate an amazing, very fulfilling meal. We were VERY hungry so ended up ordering multiple dishes and everything was good! The food wasn't too oily or greasy like most other brunch places..just wholesome goodness! Our server was pleasant and very polite. Great experience. Felt like writing this review right away!!
This is one of those times where it really paid off by being a yelper. This place was awesome! Food and service was the best!! Super friendly staff. Will visit next time were in Las Vegas. Oh, on top of great prices already, yelp has a deal where you pre purchase 20.00 value through the Yelp app for 15.00.  5.00 savings is always a good thing.
Thank you Yelp! This place has 4.5 stars for a reason. Worth the cab fare and 30 minute wait!! Staff is super friendly and food is great! Large portions and normal, non-inflated prices. I had the Cali Omelette - 4 eggs topped with cheese, sour cream, pico, and avocado slices. All super fresh and the food came out quick. . . If you're looking for local breakfast off the strip, this place is awesome.
Just finished breakfast here with friends. Omelets  were great, French toast superb. BUT the best was the pancakes. A must try. Great food a great team. Outstanding place.
So my son was acting up,  the nice person did was give him a snack , it help me out thanks guys. I love this place, I think I found my new place to eat breakfast.  I can't wait to try their lunch.
A must do while at Vegas! The staff is very friendly and the food is to die for. The Mamas french toast is extremely good and satisfying. The price is affordable which makes it a total plus.
Champ breakfast place! Loved their Greek omelet and white chocolate pancake. I love it that my hot tea is steaming hot! A must go!
The food and atmosphere was Great...you just gotta go at the right time so u dont wait too long. Thanx again Mr. Mama's Crew...we'll b back :-)
I ordered the steak and eggs. My wife ordered the pancakes and sausage and eggs.. We tried to order soft and hard boiled, respectively, to be told "we dont boil eggs here"... um what? ok whatever, poached soft and poached hard, then.. . All the eggs came at an in between, not really hard, not really soft state. I didnt complain but my wife did, and in response the waitress brought a COLD hard boiled egg. When we told her we wanted hot eggs she went and 'warmed' that same precooked egg, which was grey in the center. When we commented on microwaving eggs, she said "we didnt microwave it, we boiled it". WHAT? I thought you "didnt boil" eggs? Then when the bill came she had charged us for that egg!. . I ordered my steak rare, it came out medium. When I commented on it, the waitress brought a replacement, that was rare, but it was very mediocre, and it was NOT a ribeye as was stated on the menu.. . My wife ordered orange juice, and what they brought was orange, but it wasnt juice. She said it tasted like SunnyD.. . Overall, we were tragically disappointed, considering the rave reviews this place had received.
On our way out of town and hungry, Yelpers directed us to Mr. Mama's. The place was full and a pile of people showed up after us. Everyone was pleasant, they were fast but didn't rush us. The food was absolutely delicious! Service was excellent and friendly. There were 3 of us and we each had something different although all had omelets. Excellent food, one of the best omelets I have ever had (spinach, mushroom and jack cheese). Well definitely be back!
C'mon yelpers! 4.5 stars?? I drove so far to try this place due to the awesome yelp ratings they received and was thoroughly disappointed.  I think the reason for the high ratings was the cheap prices. You do get what you pay for. If you want cheap big portions, and not too concerned about quality, then I guess you'll be happy. . Anyway, let me start off by saying the people who work here were very nice and I have nothing negative to say about that.  The food is just average, greasy, diner food.  I ordered the breakfast burrito w/bacon. It had American cheese, bell peppers and onions, hash browns, and eggs. Was $6.75. The flavor was not bad but it was quite oily and not worth the calories! I also tried the breakfast sandwich. Got it on an English muffin with eggs, ham and American cheese. Came with side of potatoes and we chose the breakfast fries. This was also $6.75.  This also wasn't bad but there was sooo much butter on the bread. But it made the flavor good if you don't mind all the grease! The potatoes were bland, a little dry and not much to them. They came in a half round shape.  The ambience inside was well.. Not much of an ambience. It's in an industrial area so the restaurant was just an industrial type open room with the kitchen in the same space. . Sunday at 11am there was a wait. If you're in the area and wanna try basic inexpensive  food, come try it. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
Would have, SHOULD have been a five-star review.  However, it's a popular place with a long wait for a breakfast joint (over half an hour mid-Monday morning!), which we were actually okay with.  They unfortunately overlooked our order and several tables that had sat down after us were being served their meals before we were. . The staff was great and comped us a large OJ, but we were on our last day of a long vacation heading back home from Yellowstone.  We were NOT expecting a nearly two hour stop in Vegas, let alone for breakfast, hence the deduction of a star.. The food was delicious...  Have the Cali omelette with an habanero diced in it...  Wow it was good!. Do NOT overlook the pay $15 for $20 voucher you can buy through Yelp!  It's like a Groupon voucher!
This place has pretty good food.  I mostly have eaten the breakfast food.  Breakfast burrito is pretty good.  Pancakes eggs...toast.  All good.  Service is a little inconstant.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry.  Sometimes it's fast, but other times it takes forever to eat there.  Still I recommend the place.
Wife and I were looking for a local place to have breakfast and found Mr Mama's.  Had to wait about 10-15 min, no big deal. Talked with the owner while we waited. Very personable guy. Got seated, ordered chicken fried steak breakfast and Cali omelette. Waitress was very friendly. Food came out quickly, HOT, and as we ordered. Just like mom used to make, awesome! Would definitely recommend if you like home cooked style grub. YUM!
Best small place to eat in Vegas....everything my family of five ordered was great....pancakes...French toast...hashbrowns..
Soooo good. Service and food fantastic. As soon as we walked in we were acknowledged and seated right away. Hash browns definitely a must..I had steak and eggs my boyfriend had chicken fried steak.  Both awesome.  Next time I'm getting the pancakes :)
Amazing place. Just had lunch there. Burger was amazing. Wait was a little long, but that was because it was so packed. Waiter was very polite and fast paced. Was a casual mom and pop spot but definitely wasn't lacking anything. Clam chowder was amazing. Great place for breakfast and lunch since it closes fairly early. Would definitely recommend.
Very good food,  friendly staff.  Location was unexpected but was sure glad I found it!
Great little place. whole in the wall style. The waitress staff is very friendly and the food is good quality and good prices.. . thanks to yelp nation for getting the word out about this place. living in Henderson you sometimes don't get info on great places like this one.
This place is off the chain! Food, service, atmosphere and speed of service are all top-notch. Kathy (our server) and Shawn (our greeter) showed great personalities and kept us smiling... in fact, everyone in the place was smiling. I'm adding Mr. Mama's to my list of regular Vegas stops!
If there was a Mr. Mama in my family I would not hesitate to be at their house during mealtime. That is of course assuming the food was anywhere close to that offered at this restaurant. . . Located in Las Vegas off The Strip but in a small strip mall and w/in two miles of a strip club (it's Las Vegas after all, so most likely) Mr. Mama's stands as a testament to delicious food served up in nothing more than a hole in the wall establishment. They are serve breakfast and lunch and are only open until early afternoon (about 3). It's not a very big place and the wait for a table can be a little long.. . We visited on a Sunday afternoon (around 1ish) on our way home. There were already several parties waiting ahead of it. We walked up to the guy working there to put down our name on the waiting list and he was super friendly and offered us all menus to look over while we waited. This was good since when we were finally seated we had already made up our mind what we wanted. My wife ordered the Cali Omelette, my friend got the Mama's Burger, and I ordered the Mama's sandwich (turkey, bacon, onions, avocado on an onion bun) w/ a side of hashbrowns. As we waited for our food, my eyes drifted over across the room to their tv that had the current NASCAR race on. I halfway expected them to have a copy of "Mr. Mom" in the DVD player.. . The food came not too long afterwards and was extremely hot. The hashbrowns had a decent amount of flavor and were nice and crispy just how I like them. Dat Mama's sandwich tho- turkey was delicious and there was plenty of avocado inside. The onion taste overall was not overpowering and everything tasted fresh and plate presentation was awesome. My only gripe was that I noticed every plate on our table had some sort of small chip in it and a spot or two on the wall next to us also appeared to have some minor paint chippage, but honestly this did not affect food or service and should be an easy fix.. . I really liked this place a lot and the friendly service and wonderful food certainly warrant another visit on a return trip to/from Vegas. Thanks again to Yelp as we would not have found out about in our own. Definitely a diamond in the rough that is the outskirts of Vegas.
A cute little place located in the industrial area off the strip.  If you've lost all your dollars the night before just know that you can still afford a yummy breakfast at this place. . . The wait can be long sometimes but the staff is super friendly and does everything it can to make it smooth. . . The food is honestly average but has a nice home cooked taste. The portions are generous and you won't leave hungry. . . We tried an big Greek omelet and their eggs and bacon breakfast. The omelet was giant and cooked well. The bacon was thick,  smokey,  and crispy. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the home fries. They were large chips and not crispy at all.
Good spot for some yummy and inexpensive breakfast. Very welcoming and friendly! The food was decent down home breakfast goodness.. the wait was a little long, but considering we were a table of 6, I would stop by here again to give it another whirl.
Mr Mama's signage made it look like a tile store from the outside.  The restaurant was crowded and seemed to be doing well.  The service was good and friendly.. . I did not like the food here.  I got the chicken fried steak, I did not like the gravy, the fried steak was ok, but not great.   The home fries were soggy and bland.  The eggs were cooked correctly which was fine.   I also got clam chowder which was over seasoned.  My meal was not worth finishing.. . Overall the food all seemed to be prepared correctly, but the recipes that were used were just bad.  I will likely not come here again.
The food wasn't that great. I ordered a Western Omelet, and it arrived undercooked. Another moment in the pan probably would've resulted in less-runny eggs. I chose the hash browns over the potatoes after asking and taking the waitress'  advice, and those weren't very good either. The staff was polite and courteous, and split the check up for our party without a hassle. The restaurant was somewhat busy (noonish), and the service took a little too long to progress beyond the ordering stage. The food came quickly, but again, could have stood a little more preparation time. The rest of my party (mostly breakfast and 1 burger) agreed that their food wasn't very good.
I was in Vegas for a few days for some R&R with my wife.  We stayed at the Strip but wanted to get away to eat everyday.  I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  Spot on!  It is exactly what the reviews say: a cute hole-in-the-wall place on a strip mall just a mile or so away from the strip.. . I wasn't sure what to order, I like to look at other people's plates when I arrive at a restaurant and kept asking the server to tell me what they were. I'm a huge fan of biscuits and gravy so that's my go-to breakfast when in doubt. The French Toast on the table next to us looked delicious and I was leaning that direction.  Then, I saw it, the Country Fried Steak... holy schmoly, mother of all cholesterol... I couldn't take my eyes off it, it was staring at me from the table next door... and if I kept really quiet I could hear it calling my name.  So I canceled the French Toast and went with the Country Fried Steak.  The wait seemed like an eternity but my wife assures me it was less than 10 minutes; and then, it arrived.. . A huge breaded, fried piece of meat, laying next to a plateful of hash browns, three eggs on top of the potatoes, and gravy all over the steak.  I didn't know whether to smile or cry, I was so happy.  So after taking a picture I began the careful operation of breaking the egg yolks so they could infiltrate the hash browns.  This must be done carefully so that there is enough egg yolk to go around.  Trust me, with three eggs, there was plenty of egg yolk to turn the carefully-cooked hash browns into a golden, delicious pile of oh-my-gosh!  Each bite was celestial and I found myself quietly moaning inside my mouth as I enjoyed this wonderful breakfast.. . I ordered a biscuit and gravy on the side, just because it's not breakfast without biscuits and gravy.  The biscuit is not really a biscuit but a roll under disguise.  My recommendation, skip it.  My wife had the big breakfast with eggs, meats, biscuit and pancakes; she could only finish about half of it.  She loved it also.. . The servers were very friendly, the owner is a hoot.  He has a really groovy, deep, radio voice that fits his former wrestler frame just right.  The place can fill up fast, when we arrived there was no wait (10:30 am) but it quickly filled up and we saw people waiting for a good 15-20 minutes for a table so be prepared for either scenario.
So the first time I went was well over 2 months ago and I went by myself the first time. This time I came to eat with my sister and a friend and not even upon opening the door were we receiving EXCELLENT service right away. . . We didn't even open the door, the owner was the one that opened it for us. Definitely he started taking care of us right away letting us know it'll be a few minutes before being seated and gave us menus to look over. . . The place is clean and always well kept. The staff is definitely a reflection of the owner as the staff are extremely polite and always on top of it. . . This time I had a burger which was seasoned very nicely. For a "mom and pop" brunch diner joint it was a very big and delicious burger cooked to order. Your buck also goes a very long way at this place where as the portion sizes are huge. I also think they make their own ranch sauce which was also very very impressive. . . My friend and sister ordered their famous Mamas country steak and eggs. And it definitely did not disappoint.  The country gravy sauce on top really brings the meal together and yes the has browns are also seasoned and taste to perfection. . We also ordered a small cup of chili which was more a bowl size order to me. Just the right consistency on the chili, not watery and not salty. I like my chili chunky and it was just right and enough that all three of us were able to try it. . . There was so much we had to bring home. The place is always packed and the customers keep coming back I'm sure not just for the food but also for the amazing customer service received upon entering the establishment. . . Half of the dinning experience I always say is service and Mr. Mamas really has it all to a T! Again I give it to the owner who makes his way to each table to ask how they are doing and it makes the whole dining experience more personable. I love coming here and I cannot wait for their larger establishment to open and for them to move and get the bigger space they well deserve!!
This is the best place for breakfast in all of Las Vegas.  Went to the establishment with my BF last week.  The portions were very generous.  The food tasted great.  Service was excellent.  Perfect way to start the day.
Best breakfast I've had in a long time. I don't like country gravy usually but people said to try it....WOW.. . Nick the owner is awesomely nice and Claudia the server is great. A must visit in Vegas.
I have the hot cakes eggs and ham it was pretty good our waiter was friendly but my wife did not like the hash browns she said it taste like there was oregano in it

A yelp disappointment!  This place was no more special than your local Denny's.  Definitely not worth the 45 minute wait.  Save your time and eat elsewhere less crowded.
Great place off the strip. Yelp it. You wont regret it. Large portions. Wait is about 20 min. for large groups less for 2.
My favorite breakfast place! With great staff and amazing food you can't go wrong! Make sure to save room for a cinnamon roll!
Best breakfast is vegas. Close to the strip. Very friendly staff. The owner was walking around and stopped to talk to us, that dude cares, and it's nice to know. So get wasted, and head to Mr mama's in the am.
Finally tried this place. We saw a line forming and whenever I see a line, it must mean their food is excellent. We waited about 45 minutes for a table. I ordered the Cali omelette with hash browns and French Toast. Both were so good and cooked perfectly! The restaurant is small, they have 14 tables so there will be a wait. The employees are nice and they seemed to be working as fast as they could. Our breakfast was a steal. It's not as high as the other breakfast places we usually frequent. Just wish there wasn't a wait because I get impatient in lines when I'm hangry!
I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said for this place a thousand times on here already. I went there yesterday because of the reviews on here. They were right this place is fantastic its an odd location but who cares the food was great!
Very good breakfast place.  Great service (although it was a bit slow to get our food once we ordered, but they were pretty busy). Friendly staff.  Location is a bit "blink and you'll miss it."  Overall a good experience.
The staff is super attentive and totally ok with any variations we needed. The food was great. Since we've been in vegas for 10 days...it's nice to have someone cook the way you are used to. I'd encourage visitors to check them out.
This my all time default for a good meal and great service. A family ran place and everybody's greeted when you come through the door. A must try when your in town.
Terrible! Worst service I've ever had at an establishment. . . We will start with the good.. Food was fast. Hash browns were some of the best I ever had. . Okay now that's done, the bad....... The chicken fried steak wasn't seasoned and there was so much breading on it that the out side was crunchy and the inside was mush. I asked three people where my husband and my toast where and it didn't come till I was already done with my meal. My husband never even got his toast. . . Four different people came to our table not once did anyone ask "how is everything? Is there anything I can get for you?" . All the waitresses were huddled around the soda machine talking....one flaying her arms around and one bobin' her head like she was sha nay-nay. All of them asked if we wanted refills we said yes every time but no one ever brought us any. . . What made it worst is when I'm assuming the owner came and asked how was everything I couldn't say anything I took a long pause and all I could say was I just got my toast and I'm done with my meal. He says oh I'm sorry the toast was late. No guy my toast just came as you walked up. All I got was a "sorry" . . No I won't be back and I won't ever mention that anyone should go.... . . P.s. I did hear him say they were moving down the way to a larger place so I guess that's nice if you like this place.
This has become our go to breakfast place. Fantastic food and service.  We had their double chocolate chip pancakes.  Yum!
My fellow Yelpers, thank you for writing your reviews. Your reviews led me here. Yum! I wanted to go someplace away from the casinos, a place not so commercialized and not a buffet. This was just the spot. The food was so good. The service was friendly. I ordered a half side of biscuits & gravy and the California omelette. It was big enough to split with my partner. We both enjoyed our meals. If you come to Vegas, give this place a try. Yummmmm.
Mr mamas is by far my favorite breakfast place to eat, hands down. The best sausage gravy this side of anywhere.  I highly recommend eating at Mr. Mamas. You will not be disappointed..    The service is quick,  courtesy,  and precise.
It was decent. I had the breakfast burrito & out was good. It wasn't the best breakfast I had while visiting Vegas, but it was worth driving off the strip for....affordable & tasty.
