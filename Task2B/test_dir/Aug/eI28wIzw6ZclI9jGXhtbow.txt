We had seen Rose, Rabbit Lie at the Cosmopolitan Hotel on a previous trip to Las Vegas.  Absinthe is the same type of show so we were excited to attend as we . LOVED Rose, Rabbit Lie.  The show was good but not outstanding.  The seating is awful!  The chairs are metal folding chairs with no padding and they are tied together with zip ties so that they cannot be moved.  Be prepared to be touching the person you are seated next to.  There is limited table seating in the back of the tent that we wish we had purchased.  Plenty of room to move around.  Oh, and you really need to NOT be offended easily.  X Rated content!
One of the funniest shows we have ever seen! Could have skipped the gay and lesbian stuff. This show pushed every envelope and catered to almost every sense and social fear! Genius!!
Best show in Vegas, been there three times and would go again... Super funny and great show..
Best show in Vegas. Don't bring your kids and don't go if you are a prude and do not enjoy graphic puppet sex scenes. haha.  Seriously though, you will have a good time. My wife and I have seen Absinthe about 8 times over the years since it started and its been a unique and hilarious experience every time.
This show was a blast! Don't do go if you are easily offended. Not at all PC so expect crude and vulgar humor. If you sit close to the stage you stand a good chance of being the butt off a joke and possibly getting splashed just a little. Get there early because the line for the bar gets ridiculous about ten minutes before the show starts.
A great all in one show; there was amazement, there was comedy, there was sex appeal! This was my first up close and personal acrobat show but judging by the reaction from the audience the stunts were impressive and I agree. To appreciate the genre of humor used by the producer you have to understand his theme; very satirical and inappropriate, humor similar to that of Seth Macfarlane. As if the stunts aren't enough to keep your attention the performers are strip teasing in nearly every act, but they keep it somewhat modest. The slogan says it all, if you're going to see one show you should highly consider this one. Only complaints from my party were that the seats were terribly uncomfortable, however you may request a cushion, and that the show ended on a stunt that was rather unimpressive and should have been used either first or not at all, however I believe this was intentional on the producer's part (perhaps the absinthe was "wearing off" and therefore the fun too).
Terrific show, a must see! Well worth the price. Not a bad seat in the house in my opinion Tip: we got our tx from Tickets 4Tonight, I think we got a pretty good deal.
One of the most ingenious off the wall shows I've seen in forever!  Great break from the many Le Cirque and standard LV shows. Highly recommend. However only sit in first 10 rows if you are thick skinned.  Gazillionaire and Penny go off on people!
aving done my research ahead of time, I knew a few things going in. . . I didn't want to sit in an uncomfortable chair for 90 minutes and so I looked at the photos with seat numbers on them and the seating chart so that I could choose comfortable chairs along the outside. (It is not currently festival seating as others have stated). All seating seemed to offer good lines of sight so it is a matter of price and comfort.. . The host is rude, crude and socially unacceptable. He is also funny, very funny. Reading the reviews I was led to believe that my ears would bleed and the ushers (upon learning that I was from Indiana) bet that I would leave within 15 minutes. . . I admit to being kind of disappointed in that I was anticipating something that would make Andrew Dice Clay blush. Such was not the case. The emcee knew all of the basic swear words and picked on people because of their size, dress and race but nothing was shocking in the least.  His female assistant was much cruder in sexual matters (and equally hilarious).. . The acts all involved impressive acrobatic skills. Being in such an intimate environment made it that much more impresive as opposed to seeing similar feats from the balcony at a Cirque show.. . For the same price though, I prefer the Cirque shows. The acrobatic talent level seems similar, but while getting more humor you are giving up a much more grand spectacle.
Amazing acrobatics, cute story line, hilarious sexual jokes.  Think Cirque du Soleil+ laugh factory in old world burlesque . My girlfriends and I, all nine of us, laughed so hard, from the beginning to the end.  We were very pleased with the setting, the ambience, and the performance, and would love to come back for another laugh..again..and again.
Absinthe is definately bringing fusion to the show scene with a mixture of acrobatics and comedy.  Yes, the comedy is crude, but it is just so funny! Especially when they look to the crowd and bring a few people to the stage.  . . The acrobats are very talented...a lot better than the circ show I saw, which I really did not expect.  I could not believe some of the things they were doing.. . A definite must see
Very uncomfortable seating and poor view lines.  I wouldn't recommend anyone over 5'2,115 lbs, or with testicles to see this show.  You sit atop your neighbor, and there's a good chance your neighbor is from a Wisconsin bachelor party.. . Jokes are recycled stereotypes.  Raunchy is the right word, but funny is not.  Has anyone who is visiting Vegas not heard a joke about a Korean pedicurist, numerous gay slurs, or an uptight  Republican?  If you haven't heard all of these "jokes" by freshman year of college, I'd be shocked.  It's potty humor, and lacks any creativity.. . Comparing this to any Cirque show, or Rose. Rabbit. Lie. would be a disservice.  If you want comedy, go see a comedy show, and if you want entertaining acrobatics, there are a dozen shows in Vegas that are much more exciting.. . Lastly, there is nothing more annoying than the girl sidekick, Penny.  To summarize this show: It's fucking creepy.
Weird. The humor was stereotype racial and gay slurs. It was funny to a point...then it just was repetitive and annoying. The co-host has a high pitched annoying-nails-on-a-chalkboard voice. I don't get it. It's not cute to have a voice like that tell crude and obscene jokes, I could barely understand her half the time. The chairs were super uncomfortable and I couldn't see over the guy that sat I front of me.  The chairs are a mish-mash of metal folding chairs and wooden chairs. It was almost unbearable to sit thru the show on those chairs for the price that you pay for a ticket. I feel robbed. The acts were the saving grace...and the only reason i gave my rating an extra star. If you watch this show...here's a tip: Bring a stadium cushion...you'll thank me later.
Sinfully Great!. Worth the 100 Hail Mary's I have to do now by going on a Sunday! I laughed so hard, loved every minute and was so sad it was over! 90 minutes flew by! Sexy singers, funniest (dirty but dead on) comedians, high (mid-high wire) wire acrobats, gymnasts that make you want to join a gym to work on your core!. . The ring master was so dirty making fun of the audience but they just loved it...made me wish I had purchased $$ better seats to be part of the joke! All seats were good since it is such a small "tent". The ring master's assistant and he do a dance from Ancient Greece that is hilarious! She is so silly...where did she come from?. . If you don't like swearing, it is true, don't go! Right up my "Archer" loving life!
I really enjoyed this show! It's part comedy, part burlesque, and part acrobatics.. . The comedy is super vulgar and raunchy, so don't come here if you don't like swearing and super sexual jokes. I know everybody in our party thought the comedy was hilarious, and we all enjoyed the acrobatics. I also thought the music they played throughout was great, and I am currently on the hunt to figure out what songs were played. . . The show is not actually in Caesar's Palace, it is in a circus tent outside of it. The venue is very small and intimate, so it really doesn't matter where you are seated, pretty much everybody has the same view. I would advise against sitting in the front row, as the people there were picked on quite a bit.. . My only complaint would be the seating sucks. They are hard folding chairs, it's very cramped, and not too comfortable. I did see some couches in the back row, if I came again, I would try to get one of those. My back was starting to hurt during the show and since it was so tight, it was difficult to readjust the way I was sitting.
Read the reviews and be warned, you get what you get...and if you're good with it, prepared yourself to smile, laugh, and be entertained for 90 minutes.. . Yes, the space is a bit different, but that's part of the appeal. Yes, the seats could be better, deal with it. Some sight lines are a bit off, so lean over and make friends with your neighbor, everyone is there to have fun!. . My wife and I really enjoyed the show, so would recommend it to anyone that is ok with some vulgarity, has an open mind, and is looking for a fun show.. . Some advice on seating - it's hard to tell on TicketMaster, but the place is very small and intimate. The seats in the back that appear to have tables would be great for a group or couple. In my opinion, the best seats are in the back of VIP 2 with the cocktail tables...good view of all the action, cocktail waitress, table for your drink, etc. We prefer and sat in an aisles, but most have a pole somewhat in the way, so if that's an issue do the center of a section.
BEST SHOW IN VEGAS... MUST SEE!!. . This show was everything you want from Vegas... They had amazing acrobatic entertainment, some burlesque inspired sets and the best part of all raunchy humor ... My husband and I were in tears .... . Don't sit in the front if you don't like getting picked on ... Other than that ANYWHERE you sit has an amazing view!!! . . My only improvement would be the seats ... They are extremely close together (folding chairs)../ luckily we got a corner seat because I read the previous reviews ... If you aren't easily offended ... And like offensive humor this show is the one for you!!!  I would take this over a cirque show any day!
Last minute decision and don't regret any second of it!!! We went in a group of 10 and we ALL loved it. I cringed in the very beginning at the raunchy humor, but then I let go and had the best time. We were literally crying out laughing and everybody around was doing the same thing. Seating is not your typical Vegas comfortable one, but we didn't mind it at all. Acrobatics, music and everything else was excellent.
Absinthe is... unique, in a good way. It was also the most politically incorrect thing I've seen or heard anywhere, in my life. I wasn't prepared for how crude some of the jokes would be and trust me, I'm not afraid to make some pretty bad jokes. That said, once you get over how terrible some of the jokes are, it's really funny. The acts are pretty cool too. The show is very much 18+. Some of the acts are very adult themed and I would not recommend any families seeing this together. I enjoyed the show and couldn't stop laughing. Beware though, there's a 10 minute sketch with sock puppets about giving BJs. Funny but kind of weird too... If you're in the front row, prepare to get made fun throughout the show and the performers get extremely close to the front row, almost dangerously close. At the end of the show, they pick two guys to stripe tease dance for a girl they also pick from the audience. They're picked at random and they're not asked if they want to come on stage, it's basically demanded they come on stage and strip for a chick. FYI. Overall, great show.
Best comedy show we've seen in Vegas by far! There was a little of everything from awesome acrobatics to skits and audience interaction. VERY entertaining! We'd go again if the opportunity arises!
Awesome show! Probably the best one we have been to on the strip. The comedy is crude and not for everyone. If you are easily offended then this is not the show for you. We thought it was hilarious. If you sit up front there is a good chance you will get picked on. All of the acrobats were amazing and everything is up close since the performance is in a circus tent. My only complaint are the fold out chairs. After an hour it started to get uncomfortable but that's a minor issue.
Off beat humor, raunchy, sexual innuendoes, amazing acrobatics. Two hosts who are politically incorrect, and could care less about racial, and sexual preference sensitivity. Three words; I love it! I laughed so hard, and was in awe when need be. Go!
In 1999, I was a senior in high school and I was lucky enough to go on a trip with my French class to Paris. It was a dream come true for this Francophile, and I loved every minute. One of the strongest memories I have is the night at the "Gypsy Circus". My French teacher was one cool lady, and made sure we saw the authentic (and at times seedy) Paris, and this was truly it. We walked up to a ratty tent set up in a bad part of the city, and walked through the velvet curtain. Here I saw things I'd never see in small town America. There were Chinese acrobats, women hanging dangerously from silks, strong men contortionists, and even an act involving a cat. This was Cirque du Soleil  before Cirque du Soleil was a thing. It was exotic, slightly erotic, and a little strange. Sitting in the tent watching Absinthe tonight was the closest thing I've seen to the gypsy circus from my youth. Oh, and there's lots of dirty, offensive jokes and I laughed myself silly. Bravo.
Just go!  If inappropriate behavior and language bother don't.  Hands down one of the funniest, amazing, jaw dropping shows I've ever seen!  LOVED IT!
