We ordered the beef ribeye for two, the pork chop, the beef cheek ravioli, mixed mushrooms with onion, and the parmesan potatoes. It was so amazing. It was the biggest steak I've ever seen. Something out of the Flintstones with the bone attached. They carve it table side and finish it with extra virgin olive oil. The beers and wine were light and complemented the meat. The ambiance, the expert waiting staff, and the location  are all part of the experience. You get what you pay for and this, abiet expensive was worth it.
I was in Las Vegas for a trade show and took 8 associates to dinner. The service and presentation were professional and informative. We ordered 4 appetizers and they were all superb. The side dishes were all to die for. Now, the bad news. I have eaten in steakhouses all over America and in my all time favorite city for steak, Florence, Italy, which I suppose Carnevino attempts to emulate. The quality of the meat is not even up to the standards of a typical country roadhouse. The NY strip was tough and had absolutely no flavor. No way are they serving prime beef. For $61.00 per strip,  I expect perfection. I feel hustled. The filets were no better according to others at the table. If you are serious about, beef, stay away. Two stars only because apps and sides are superb.
Everything still stands from my previous review PLUS they've added a Cicchetti menu which is the Italian version of tapas. My wife and I ordered one of each of the 10 offerings and they were all delicious with special consideration being given to the Carne Cruda. Amazing cocktails and a very talented bar staff and props to the always amazing Chef Nicole.
This steak house has hands-down the BEST pork chop I've ever had in my life.  Medium well, thick juicy tender cut of heaven.  That and the lard spread are both to die for!  If I were on death row and was to request a last meal before I part this world.. I would choose this pork chop.
I can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars. Are y'all crazy?! I'm guessing it's because of the prices. It can't be the food, there is just no way. This is a 5 star restaurant hands down. They have 9 month aged dry bone in rib-eye for heaven's sake. That's 273.9 days! The quality of their meat is perfect. This place is perfect.. . It's pricey, but what do you expect in Las Vegas? If you can't afford it go test your luck at a black jack table. Trust me, you'll wish youdid. Best steak I have ever tasted.
So we went here last night for my friend's 30th birthday. Since we had such a big group we had a reduced menu to help get the orders in faster. I was a little irritated that the reduced menu didn't have any vegetarian entree alternatives but thats was probably my friends fault not theres. they brought me out a full menu, unfortunately i was disappointed by the fact that all of there pasta's were made tomato sauce, which is fine but i really want a pasta dish with some Alfredo sauce. the the three courses i had were ok but nothing to write home about. I will admit the service was really good, im not sure i would go here again.
I am a big Mario Batali fan and have really enjoyed some of his other establishments such as Eataly and Mozza, but Carnevino left me wanting more.. . // LOCATION // In the Palazzo at the entrance of the casino on the strip so no need to walk deep into the casino to find it. . . // FOOD //.      + Ricotta and egg ravioli: Beautiful ravioli, but the 1 large ravioli I received for the small portion could not justify the anything but small price tag.      + Porterhouse: Tried a bit of the porterhouse, but it lacked flavor and did not pack the punch you would imagine steak would at a steakhouse.
My favorite steak place.  Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye is the way to go.  This place. is bit on thepricey side though.  One reason you gotta love this place is its variety; great steaks, great pastas, great seafood, great wine selection.  I always stop in when I  am in Las Vegas.
I'm giving this place three stars for a couple of reasons. One, the food wasn't what's expected for an Italian steak house when you're getting an average meal for the hype of an iron chef rep. The atmosphere was average, the service was better than ok, but what intrigued me the most what the food.  The food was not an an elevated status like you would expect from a place that has a well known industry Titan. Food plus a few bottles of wine, will set you back a couple of thousand dollars. Definitely my not favorite place in my Vegas experience!
After spending so many years in the restaurant industry I thought I had a good understanding of what a steak house should be. I have never been so wrong in my life! Carnevino from the service to the execution of each plate was nothing less then perfect.. . My fiancee and I were amazed at just how attentive and just how perfectly the staff worked together to take care of not only us but each table.. . Our dining experience started off with Tagliata di Manzo arugula, parmigiano drizzled with ages balsamic and the grilled Octopus pickled vegetables and limoncello. The bar was set high with these first offerings and only got better and better with the progression of each course.. . We moved on to our pasta course. We had . Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter. I have to say that each bite was blissful and decadent. It's one of those dishes you will think about long after its gone. We also had the beef cheek raviolis with aged balsamic. The plate was all to quickly bare and I just wanted more!!. . Now we come to the meat which is the realm of one of the most talented chefs I know Adam Perry Lang. . .                                   ( BBL Beef. . Our all natural BBL beef is hand selected and aged in our meat chamber by our man Adam Perry Lang. BBL beef is often beyond regular USDA prime standards for marbling and flavor and is hormone and antibiotic free. We rub all of our beef with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to get a delicious and slightly charred crust.). . My fiancee chose the filet I had the . Bone-In New York Strip 16 oz dry aged bbl beef. . To co-star with our steaks we ordered the Porcini Bearnaise, Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes, Tuscan fries and "Creamed" Corn with pickled peppers. . . To begin with the steaks are masterfully carved for you table side then sprinkled with finishing salt and drizzled with olive oil. To say my steak was good would be not only one of the greatest understatements of my life but it would be sacrilege. It was prefectly cooked and it melted in my mouth. The co-stars or sides just seem to enhance what we were consuming. My favorite were the Mashed potatoes maybe because of the yolk or because of the bacon either way everything was incredible.. . Our dining journey ended with Caramel Panna Cotta caramelized bananas, raspberries as well as . Plum, peach and mango sorbeti. . . This is one of those places that will change the way you look at food and is an experience you must have at least once.
We came here under high recommendation and we came away with a very good steak house dinner. Not the best of my life, but very good.. . The atmosphere is pure steak house with theSommelier station right in the middle of the dinning room where we were seated (more on that later).  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. He had many suggestions based on our feedback. . . The wine list is extensive and we ordered a nice Cab. For mains we each had the same-Filet Mignon (no bone) which was very good. The highlight for me was the mashed potatoes with egg. I could have consumed 2 or 3 of them. It was just a perfect combination and piping hot. I'm hungry now just writing about it!. . For dessert I ordered the chocolate and peanut butter torte. It was fine but not great. My double espresso was outstanding.. . One thing bothered me a bit most of the evening. I watched the Sommelier and his assistants (they were right in front of our table) spend a lot of time preparing many wines for the tables around us. They seemed to almost overdue it. They would pour a very small amount in each glass and coat the entire glass with it then pour it out. They would often light a match under the bottle (to look for sediment?). It almost seemed contrived to the point it did annoy me. Hey-in Vegas I guess you're supposed to put on a show. . . Bottom line: It's a very good steak house but next time if I feel like a filet I will probably go back to SW or Eiffel Tower.
In short, the meal that my wife and I had at Carnevino was simply the best meal I've ever had. Service was impeccable and the food was stunning and delicious.. . Our server was friendly, enthusiastic, and attentive. He overheard that it was my birthday and planned accordingly without my wife having to take him aside. The warm rosemary ciabatta bread was served with their "lardo" spread - soft, rendered pork fat mixed with butter and flecks of bacon - and it was delicious.. . We started with the heirloom tomato caprese and thecheese wasn't the usual buffalo mozzarella - it was a special blend that our server said without a hint of bravado that they've simply searched years to find the exact right blend, and after one taste I believe him. It tasted amazing.. . My wife's veal scallopini in porcini mushroom sauce was the best she's ever had, anywhere. My $65 New York bone-on strip steak was cut table-side and arranged on my plate by a server with almost magical knife skills. The chef sent us a complimentary roasted corn "first of the season" dish in cast-iron which was fresh, crunchy, salty, and spicy. The mashed potatoes with mascarpone cheese had an egg cracked in it and was rich and delicious.. . My steak was dry aged for 3 months, cooked perfectly medium rare, and was hands down the best steak I've ever eaten. The texture and flavor was complex and beefy. I've simply never had a steak as good as this. It was served with a sprinkling of sea salt and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. At home I can cook an excellent steak but I quite literally have no idea how they cooked or made this piece of meat taste so incredible.. . A complimentary lemon flavored aperitif followed our meal. Tiramisu for dessert, with Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce, with 3 complimentary flavors of gelato. Like the steak, this tiramisu was leaps and bounds better than any other I've had.. . My only minor complaint is that the only music being played was non-stop Van Morrison. I'm fine with VM, and it fits the style and ambiance of the restaurant very well, but a little more variety would have been nice. It was like someone had an iPod filled with hours of VM-only songs and just hit Shuffle for the 2 hours we were there.. . Next time I'm in Las Vegas I will cancel any other plans I've made elsewhere to have a chance to eat at this restaurant again.
