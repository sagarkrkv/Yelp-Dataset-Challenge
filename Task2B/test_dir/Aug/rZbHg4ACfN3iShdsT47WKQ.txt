The brisket is really good and brittle, probably better off getting a brisket sand which. The 3 meat platter is really good, gives you an idea of what you will most likely get the second time around. And after trying between the sausage, brisket and ribs, ribs definitely take the cake! Corn bread is also good as an appetizer, and the grilled veggies really had some good flavor as we'll. The sauces are really good to I suggest the spicy, and at the end we got mini sugar donuts! Yum! Btw our waitress was Chelsea and she was awesome!
1st time here. We drove through lightning and hardcore rain but it was definitely worth it. Waitress was nice, the manager came by to check on us and the food was very very good. We are visiting from CA and we will make sure to eat here next visit. Complimentary cornbread with sweet butter, yum!
BOBBY Q'S. was just ranked among the TOP 30  BBQ  restaurants in the US! . . Need I say more?
The ribs are awesome! Fully cooked and delicious, meat fell off the bone! The corn beard was money and best part of meal! This is a real bbq spot! If your in the mood for some really good ribs or bbq stop by and try it! Nice staff and clean place
Came here on a whim. The outside is very deceptive but the inside is pretty nice, great atmosphere and mood lighting. The food though is the key here. In one word, spectacular! I got the brisket sandwich with Mac & cheese. So so so good!  The brisket falls apart it's so tender, and really doesn't need a sauce. The Mac & cheese is gooey, creamy & hot. The husband had the BBQ chicken and he inhaled his. Just a great meal.
We are from the Midwest and it's difficult to find good BBQ around here.  This is the best!  It is definitely a Midwest style BBQ.  Lots of parking behind the building.  The Hostess was sweet and knowledgable and let me look around the lounge area and told me about the dancing and crowd.  We got seated pretty quickly even though it seemed crowded.  We went on a Sunday about 130pm.  The Server (Dana) was great.  She said she had been there for 8 years.  They bring you corn bread to start.  It was really good and very moist.  We decided to order an appetizer since we hadn't been here before.  We ordered the wings 1/2 & 1/2.  They were both amazing but the BBQ was so good, next time I would order all BBQ.  We ordered the Half Hog platter to share.  It was the Sunday feature so it was only $31.99.  It came with ribs, brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  It was all wonderful!! It was a lot of food.  It said it feeds 2-4 people.  It is definitely enough for 4 people.  It also comes with choice of 2 sides.  We got the mac & cheese and shoe string fries.  The mac & cheese was so creamy and delicious!  The fries were good too.  The only negative I have to say is that they serve Pepsi products.  We will be going back a couple times per month.  And I might go one night to try the Salsa dancing.
Food was sub par. We got there about 20 minutes before close and they were converting it into a night club so we got a to-go order. They forgot some of my order and it defeated the whole purpose of going there. The donuts were good, but I know good BBQ and this isn't it. I called and left a message about the messed up order and they took like a week to call me back. Not going back.
Made the trip up the 17 to visit Bobby Q last night. I love me some good bbq, and had heard good things about Bobby Q, so it was time to give it a try. It being a summer Tuesday night the parking lot was busy, but not packed and we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was doing a good business. I enjoyed the interior. It was one of the most, dare I say, upscale bbq places I've frequented, though it's not upscale at all. . . Our server came by quickly and introduced herself. She asked if we had ever been there before and when we said no she got excited and told us all about the place. We each ordered a beer and decided what to order. We settled on the Whole Hog Heaven Feast to get a sample of a few things. Our Whole Hog included St. Louis & Baby Back Ribs along with brisket and sausage. For our sides we went with the ranch beans, corn, and mac n cheese. We weren't able to polish off the whole thing, but we came close. . . I must say that these were some of the best ribs I've had in a long time! They were perfectly cooked, easy to remove from the bone, but not fall off the bone, and amazingly the pork stayed together. I slightly preferred the baby backs. I wasn't as big of a fan of the brisket, but then again I am generally not a fan of brisket. To me, the best bbq is pork. The sausage was good, but I wouldn't go and order it as my dish. We got some of their spicy bbq sauce on the side and thought it had a good flavor. You could feel the heat, but it wasn't hot or overpowering and didn't linger. . . Of the sides we agreed the mac n cheese was the winner, though the beans were flavorful as well. The mac n cheese is certainly cheesy! Corn is corn. . . I know I really liked this place because as I was eating I swung my legs like a little kid who can't touch the ground with their feet. Signs of a happy camper. . . We are gluttons for punishment so we got some apple cobbler for dessert. It was good, but not memorable. Overall, the service here was wonderful and everyone made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be back!
5 stars are meant for restaurants like these!!. . I went to Buckeye, AZ for business and contacted my friend that goes to pharmacy school in AZ and told him "I'm hungry. Where should I go". Without hesitation he recommend me here!. . I am really satisfied and happy he recommended me Bobby Q!. . The brisket, baby back ribs and baked potato is AMAZING!. . The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent!. . I will definitely go back when I'm in Arizona!
Hands down. AMAZING BBQ. Dinner started with delicious cornbread. Then we split the combo platter which was very large for $13 and had ribs, brisket, pulled pork, corn and the nice waitress even brought us out some cole slaw and Mac and cheese to try. Delicious!!!  The waitress was extraordinary. I saw drinks being brought out in real pineapples. At the end they even bring you out a bag of hot fresh donuts. This place is YOWZA good. Total bill was a measly $15. LOVE!
It was awesome. We had the prime rib and ribs. The were tender and very tasty.  The pecan slaw was very good too.  Our server Victoria did a lovely job too. Highly recommend
I was excited after reading the reviews, but I was a little disappointed. I was looking more of a Little Miss BBQ real BBQ type of place. It is a beautiful restaurant inside I must say. . . I should've known I was in trouble when I asked the waitress if they had burnt ends and she had no idea what that was. I ordered ribs and brisket. The brisket was ALOT of fat, not what I was expecting. The meat with the brisket was good, just not enough of it. The ribs I'm sorry to say were not memorable. Sides were pretty good. . . I also ordered an appetizer. It came out after my entree arrived. They were kind enough to not charge me for the appetizer because of this. I have to say service was good but I don't think I will return.
We drove 30 min to B.Q. this past Saturday evening 7:30ish our first visit.The place was jumping & we were starving we happily gave our name to the young hostess and asked how long does she think it will be - about an hour & a half - ok. So we left and got a quick snack to hold us over down the street . We returned  30 min later & the place was half empty  with the same hostess at the front had called us twice. Where did 1 1/2  hour wait go? No big deal.. . So by this time we forgo the dinner idea and ordered  cocktails and a couple brisket sandwiches along with the sides. "" WOW"  Wheres the beef ?  It sure wasn't on our table it looked more like an empty Mcdonalds bun. The sides were good along with the tad of beef. Table service was A+ and triple A+  to the nicest lady flr mgr who was working hard helping out on the tables...... Sweet idea with the donuts....  . Big disappointment - over $40.00 bucks &  no beef.  Sorry for the ding.
Great Gluten Free choice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This place is on my Favorites list. Not only do they have amazing BBQ but they have real menu for Gluten Free options even though it includes nearly every item from the regular menu.  Server very knowledgeable and not afraid to go ask kitchen staff questions.  My family sampled almost every BBQ item on the menu and couldn't decide which was best.  And those that get Dairy and tried the Mac & Cheese you all who who posted are right they say it was the best as was the birthday desert i couldn't eat. Thanks anyway.
bad table at the back by the kitchen door, so we moved to the bar. Great Lemonade and beer. We had brisket and a burger it was not good. The brisket had no bark and it was laden with blobs of fat and thickly sliced, tasted more like a pot roast. The sauce was boring and the bread was also so very boring. The hamburger is supposed to be favorite but why?  The mac and cheese was an overly thick and gluey. No garnish on the plates and a badly bruised and bent pickle. Waiter overcharged us an extra sandwich. . Too bad, we gave him a good tip anyway. Just an over-hyped place. Cute name and decor.
All you need to know is... PULLED PORK!!! It is seriously one of the best pulled pork I've ever had! I'm from California and we are blessed with Phil's BBQ and my sister and I prefer Bobby Q over Phil's BBQ!. . What We Ordered. - Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. - 2 Meat Combo: Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. - Steak Sandwich with Shoestring Fries. - Catfish Po Boy Sandwich with Roasted Corn. . The complimentary corn bread was good! Very moist! The beef brisket was good! The meat was tender but I felt that I needed to add the bbq sauce for it to taste better. The Mac and Cheese was super duper cheesy!! I loved it!! The Mashed Potatoes were really good as well! Super buttery and smooth.. . The Pulled Pork (not pictured because my sister was sitting too far) was AMAZING. It was good by itself or with the bbq sauce! I really wished I ordered this instead, like I originally planned. Luckily, my sister let me sample some of hers. :) My Mom enjoyed her catfish po boy. She's really picky so that's telling you something lol. My Sister and Mom loved the roasted corn!. . The only bad dish was the Steak Sandwich but I don't know if that's because my Dad ordered it medium well. He said it was too chewy and had no flavor. His shoestring fries were really, really salty and soggy! He was very upset, to say the least lol.. . They give you little sugar donuts, (Thank Q's), at the end of the meal! They were so cuteeee! They were just average tasting but I enjoyed the fact that they were free! I will come back for the Pulled Pork!
Another great meal at Bobby Q Kristi M. services was awesome lunch menu was r reasonable the Q rolls are amazing. Unfortunately I'm on a diet wanted to bring my son someplace so I had a salad, which was good too.
Best Mac N Cheese in town!! Best steak, best ribs, best onion rings...I don't think I've ever tried something I didn't love! Very friendly staff. "Take out" is fast and best of all the pint of mac n cheese is only like $4 including the Best corn bread in town!! Lol
i'm torn. on the one hand, the service was superb, we liked the actual dining experience, and some of the food was great (mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, cornbread, wings, donuts, arnold palmer cocktail). on the other hand, i went for some RIBS and that is where they failed me. i had whet my appetite last week at pork on a fork where i had some seriously tasty ribs. like i wanted to climb up onto the plate and roll around in them, that is how good they were. so now i'm on this bbq blitz and it was my birthday so i requested to come to bobby q based on reviews seeming so positive, like supposedly best bbq in phoenix! anyway, got baby back ribs and you couldn't even pick up a rib that is how much the meat fell off. like literally reached for a bone and all i got was bone, meat stayed on the plate. it was like a gelatinous mess. there should be some bite, some crispy parts from the smoker, something! and i wasn't crazy about the sauce - ribs were way over-sauced, like sauce got slapped on right before they went on the plate and i did not care for the flavor of it. no choice of sauce, yet when we were packing up our leftovers the waitress appeared with two different kinds in to-go containers. huh? so i wonder if i had ordered something else if i would have been happier, but still. truthfully, i doubt i will come back unless someone else makes me and if i do i will stay away from ribs.
Great service! Waiter was friendly and knowledgable, special touches like the extra BBQ came out heated in an insulated craft my drink was in a pineapple fun stuff like that . The brisket was absolutely the best I have ever had and the Mac and cheese was pretty awesome too ! Big portions so bring your appetite !
This place was AMAZING!!!  I ordered the pulled pork and it was soooo tender.  This is the best BBQ I have ever had.
Brisket is flavorful and moist. Service from Jake was prompt and off the charts friendly.. Will visit again.. Next time need to try their house ale.
So-so BBQ.  I had the brisket and St. Louis-style ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled corn.. . 1. Brisket - Average in flavor.  Nice and moist, but the only seasoning was the sauce (sauce was good...sweet Carolina style).  Needless to say I drenched the meat in sauce.  Overall, I found the meats to be smokeless and pretty bland. . . 2. Ribs - See above.. . 3. Cornbread - Very tasty sweet cornbread.  My favorite.. . 4.Mashed Potatoes - They nailed this side dish.  Smooth and creamy, with a peppery overtone.  I wish I would have just ordered a plate of this as my meal.. . 5. Grilled Corn - Tasted more "burned" than "grilled".  I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of since I often think about the kids starving in Ethiopia).. . 6. Frosted Lemonade - I think I had 4 glasses before I passed out from sugar overdose.  These things are REALLY good!. . 6. Dessert donuts - tasty, need more of these.. . 7.  Service - Excellent, no complaints here.. . . Overall, I wouldn't advise against going, I just wouldn't go out of my way to make the trip out there.  The meats were IMO very unremarkable.
The smoke house wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Q rolls a must have, and the brisket was too die for.
Loved this place - of course, another great find from Yelp! . . We were in the area, and headed on in due to great reviews. Can I just say - holy cow giant drinks! We ordered our drinks and they came out in fun "glasses." And when I say glasses, I mean his was a ginormous martini style glass and my so-called glass was a cut out pineapple. The people at the table next to us on the patio were like...um, what did you two order?? We had no answers for them other than...awesomeness apparently! I've had some small martinis for $10 before...so this was just...whoa.. . I had the pulled pork and mac and cheese. I will admit that the pulled pork was a bit dry, but a little extra BBQ sauce and that's an easy fix. Plus the BBQ sauce was delicious, so it gave me an excuse to use more! Win. . . The mac and cheese was, for lack of a better word, luscious. Creamy, cheesy and everything good southern style comfort food mac and cheese should be.. . The real winner here for me was hands down the cornbread though. I'm a huge cornbread fanatic, and theirs was true southern to the core. Well done Bobbby Q, well done.. . Overall: A+. Some good southern BBQ with great sauce and great sides. And...the drinks..I mean seriously...the drinks!
Omg some of the best food I have had in a long time. We ordered the Q rolls as an appitizer. This is basically a brisket egg roll, these were yummy. I ordered the 12 oz. Top sirloin,  I was a little disappointed that it was not quite the way I order it. The mac and cheese was just awesome. I dare say it was almost better than my dads. My husband order the sirloin as well and enjoyed it but didn't care for the shoestring fries. All in all a good meal.
Great BBQ dinner on our last day of Phoenix vacation. Great staff - Ashlynn explained history of restaurant, how ribs and brisket prepared, and choices of sauces. Had a "Whole Hog Heaven" - which for our family was baby backs, St Louis ribs, and double order of smoked beef brisket. Tried two sauces - regular and spicy, which came to us in two small carafes for pouring. Sides included corn bread, roasted corn and ranch beans. Everything was tasty and we had left overs for part of lunch the next day. Ended with a death by chocolate dessert - which was two pieces of cake and a huge dollop of cream. Staff came by to replace empty drinks and refill water. A little dark inside so we were afraid to see what BBQ sauce stains were on our shirts when we left, but overall, a great place to dine.
A) this place is open on Sundays which apparently a lot of good lunch spots in Phoenix are not and B) this is one of the best BBQ joints I've ever been to! . . The BBQ brisket was tender and moist, my bf is from the south and was very impressed with the authentic Carolina BBQ sauce. The service was really above and beyond, at least 3 different staff members came to check up on us and everyone was SO friendly. (A certain resort in Sedona could learn from the people here!). . . The strawberry lemonade was super sweet and after you've stuffed yourself on delicious, moist BBQ, they give you 4 donuts in a bag with your check. Great idea because a bag of beignets certainly makes paying easier, though the food and service were so good, paying would never be a burden here. . . If you like BBQ, you MUST come here! We'll be back for sure!
I have not been here in a long time, and man Bobby Q's has really stepped up their game. Same location, same awesome feel with better food and service.. . We had a great time! The baby back rips were spot on, the pulled pork was nice and moist, and the brisket had very little fat on it. The side were all fantastic as well. Extra cheesy Mac and Cheese and fluffy mashed potato's. This was all washed down with there house beer, which was a Red from Sedona Brewing. No complaints at all on the food.. . The service was also great! My pops was in town from Florida so we all went out and our server was more then accommodating the kids and all of our needs. He did a fantastic job, and had several other tables besides ours. . . Plus you get a little bonus before and after your meal. Bonus number 1, 10% off your bill when you do a yelp check in. Bonus 2, corn bread brought to you before your meal. Bonus 3, after your meal you get cinnamon  donuts. . . I am looking forward to going back and thankfully this is one of the few BBQ places that is a reasonable distance from my house.
The Smokehouse burger (minus the BBQ sauce) is the best burger in all of Phoenix.
Love this place. Food is reasonably priced and the portions are large enough for lunch the next day. Wish their beer menu was a little better and cocktails not so expensive but everything is made from fresh ingredients so Iunderstand. I LOVE THE FOOD!!!!
Was in the Phoenix area and had heard about this place and we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. The service was extremely good, the BBQ was exceptionally good, and the food was reasonably priced. I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again.
I really liked this place.  The atmosphere is cute and the server was so friendly and helpful. Everything we ordered tasted amazing.  I had a ribeye cooked to perfection.  Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were so delicious.  The potato salad wasn't great but everything else was amazing. Loved the lemonade and my husband had the ribs and Pecan slaw.  It was just really good food and service.  I'm definitely going back.
We have lived In Phoenix for 10 years and have driven by hundreds of times as we driven down I-17.  We finally stopped in yesterday and WOW!  The atmosphere, service (thanks Jo), and especially the food which was nothing less than phenomenal! My steak was better than any steak I've eaten at any major steak house. Ribs were incredible, and their sides are amazing. Great portion sizes, and you get a lot of food for their prices.  Then hard part is finding how to get there; the Dunlap exit is the key to success.  We cannot wait to return.
First time here for me and what took me so long to try it?? Food was excellent, service was quick and friendly. Jack, our waiter, was  The Best Server I have ever experienced. My teenaged son even questioned why he was being so nice. I guess when you are used to mediocre to poor service you are surprised when the service is exceptional. We will be back!!!!
We split the 2 meat combo. Both the brisket and baby back ribs were flavorful and tender. The cornbread is delicious snd the side of corn was nice and smokey. Great food!
The pulled pork is amazing.  Sit at the bar with bar with Chelsea and Tony.  They are funny and great with  bourbon suggestions.
