A place I can always count on!  I love gambling at Palace station.  Best of all, Oyster bar has the best Alaskan chowder.  Lots of chunky seafood.  The only thing I don't like is the very long wait time to get seated.  Even after seated, it takes an extra 45 minutes for the food to arrive.  Expect and average 2 hour wait at any hour of the  day.  Even so, it's well worth the trip every time to go to vegas.
Yummo! Had the shrimp & lobster fra diablo and added spicy 8. Holy moly! Sooo good. You sit at the bar and they cook it for you right there for you. People are nice. Only 21+  definitely coming back! Love seafood! A must try place. Line can be long cuz it's first come first serve and there are only 16 seats.
Came at 3:15 AM and didn't have to wait. The bar was nicely set up as an open kitchen. The chefs and waiters were funny and friendly. . . 1/2 dozen oysters at happy hour rate: threw in a couple of little ones on the house. . Order of Littleneck Clams: the soup was delightful too . . Bouillabaisse Medium spice: most delicious seafood dish ever had, period. We live in LA and thought we were privileged but wrong!! This was the most amazing thing that can happen in your mouth! :) . . Very impressive! Would be back every time in town.
Yes, all of the above and below reviews say it all - this place is mind-blowing! For you savoryand spicy seafood seekers here is your haven.  . . The Food- Choose from fresh oysters on a half shell that are so fresh and briny that you might just need to check yourself and step out of the Palace Station looking for the ocean.  Start with these then definitely choose from the pan roast or jambalaya. You can indicate your heat level from 1-10 so go for it.  If you don't like slimy okra you might want to ask them to remove it but it does add a bit of an earthy flavor.  I also recommend you ask for the rice on the side so it doesn't get lost in the thick delicious tomato-cream base of the pan roast or the thick Cajun creole spiced base. . . The Ambiance - casual and unpretentious. If you get the Maya Rudolph look-a-like server you be sure to be entertained (tip graciously she has baby #4 on the way). Despite what others have said about showing up on off-hours to grab a seat, this is all false. There is no optimal time. Come on people in 20 years this place has had almost every seat filled 24 hours round the clock so it's basically luck if you don't have to wait an hour or two. Be prepared and have a small meal a few hours in advance so you can truly enjoy your experience.  M
After reading all of the glowing reviews, we finally made our way to the Oyster Bar and we were not disappointed!. . For starters, we ordered a dozen fresh oysters on the half-shell.  Although the oysters were large, they did not have the briny taste that I look for.  I asked the waitress where they procure their oysters and she said Louisiana.  Maybe I'm used to oysters from the East coast.. . For entrees, we ordered the Combo Pan Roast and the Lobster Gumbo.  The pan roast was creamy and filled with shrimp, crab and lobster and the Level 5 spiciness was just right.  The lobster gumbo was full of chunks of tender lobster and it was delicious!. . And, contrary to popular belief, there IS an optimal time to come to the Oyster Bar.  We came at 9:30 am on a Tuesday and did not have to wait at all.  Then, at 10 am, we were the only two customers there.  I've attached a photo that shows all of the empty seats just waiting for customers!
This place has become my new favorite place. Not a lot of seating so be prepared to wait. It's worth the wait though, the food is amazing. . . I got the combo pan roast and it is filled with big chunks and lobster and pieces of shrimp. The crab is mixed in with the bisque, so you get plenty of it. I get spicy level 5.
The food here is AMAZING!!!. . There IS a reason why people are waiting for this gem of a place, folks!!. . However, I marked off one star because of the long wait. My husband and I came here this past Saturday (at around 3PM) and we waited a total of 1.5 hours.. . It was really pathetic at first but after a while, we decided to just go with it since we did want to try this place.. . THANKFULLY....it did NOT disappoint!!. . The food was delectable. You get to choose how spicy you want your food from the scale of 1-10, 1 being not spicy and 10 being very spicy.. . We had:. - The seafood combo platter (included raw oysters, raw clams, and shrimp cocktail)- delicious & fresh!. - I ordered the Pan Roast Combo and it was SOoooooO yummy and pungent in flavor. It came with a scoop of rice in it. I couldn't finish the whole thing because of how heavy it was, but every single bite was heaven. So delicious and creamy.. makes me think differentlyof the typical "lobster bisque now".. this one is like a lobster bisque but. with LOTS OF crab meat chunks, shrimps and all the other seafood in it..... I HIGHLY recommend this dish if you are wondering what to order.  My friend had recommended it and now I get why. ;). - My husband ordered the house Gumbo. He loved it too. I tried a little bit but didn't like it as much since he had ordered it a little bit spicy.. . OVERALL I recommend this place..(THUMBS UP!) I still haven't decided if we'll be back since the wait can be a burden..But we will see. :)
The food is a 10 on a scale of 1-5.. But because this place is so scrumptious it's always busy. Even on a Tuesday evening at 1:30am. . The chef was pretty awesome too and had personality that kept me staying patient. . Optimistically speaking- food was delicious after 1.35 hrs of waiting!!!
It appears that the Oyster Bar is a hidden gem amongst the Vegas locals. I came here on a bachelor party with friends and the line was well worth it! We arrived around 10pm and the line was still 45 minutes long. There are only a certain amount of stools to sit on. I asked what ocean the fish and shellfish was from and the man had a smart ass answer for me but it's okay. I just prefer not to eat fish full of radiation from the Pacific Ocean. . . Everything we ordered was great and I also liked their beer and wine selection. If you are in the mood to wait a while for some grub, this is the spot.
Got really drunk and came here at 12 midnight cause my b**** friend was hungry. Not a real long line when we came but ended up waiting 4 hours!!!! Finally got to eat at 430...... and was tired as fuuuuuuu**. I started by downing my water from thirst, then I just sat there waiting for them to refill, but they never did until my friend asked for it. Then we order and it took ANOTHER 45 mins (about, I dont know, my phone died) to get our food.  Food was great...... but the wait..... god I would have never came if I knew they worked that slow.
This place is a hidden gem! !! You have t get the pan roast it's the best!  It is why I come back to this place every time I feel like some seafood. Portions are huge too!  You can't go wrong here. Sometimes one of the  chefs might be a little tipsy,  but he still know what he's doing ! Trust me it's worth it!
Expect at least a 1-3 hour wait if you're trying to grub during evening hours. Honestly the BEST gumbo in Vegas though. It's a must try place if you have time to spare and want good food.
Enjoy a 50 oz beer while you watch these artist go to work. Dolores our server was very pleasant and our chef Holloman prepared an excellent meal. Everything is done fresh right in front of you. It's just a 12 personish bar soof you get there at the wrong time there is a wait. But it's well worth it. Roast pan combo was great. Cream tomato sauce with shrimp crab lobster and some type of heaven I guess.  Oh yah Rice!  Very hearty so I'm not used to so much but I powered through and got the whole thing down.  Level 10 spice for me no prob. I gotta go back!
Man I wish I would not have told the waiter spice was okay. My Alaska Chowder was really good but it was too spicy for me. You can't unspice it. ...The seafood was hearty and fresh. I love that they are open 24 hours!! I ate there after Marquee on a Monday night (Tuesday morning at like 3:30 am).
I was really disappointed at this place. The oysters were disgusting (not cleaned or sweet). The combo pan roasts that yelpers raved about had no lobster and the broth had a lot of crab shell. Not worth the wait or my time. To top it off the chef was rude and not professional. Never again Oyster Bar.
It takes a long time. One order would be good for two. Pan roast all day.
I apologize I reviewed the wrong restaurant.
