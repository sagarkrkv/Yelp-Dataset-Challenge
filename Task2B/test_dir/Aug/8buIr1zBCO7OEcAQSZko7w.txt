My husband and I go to Firefly at least twice a week and this place is always hoppin!  We usually sit at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table and there is a steady stream of great people watching.  I love the tapas style menu because we can order several plates and just share.  The bread and butter spread they bring is super yummy.. . A few of my personal favorites from the menu:. bacon wrapped dates!!!. tomato soup and grill cheese. pupusa (octopus) this is divine. sliders. roasted peppers. empenadas. goat cheese and beet salad. fries. . They also serve a very tasty infused fruit vodka and the service is always friendly and fast.. . Awesome low prices, especially for the quality and hoppin atmosphere.  I would especially recommend this to tourists, however I'd like to keep it as a secret gem for us locals!
