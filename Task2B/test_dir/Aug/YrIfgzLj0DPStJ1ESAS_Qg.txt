I love this restaurant. I'm here every 2-3 weeks. I'm not a crawfish eater but the shrimp is delicious. They never fail to serve it the way I like it, plain and not spicy! Service is quick, wait times on the weekends are crazy but so worth the wait! They recently opened another location so I'm sure wait time have decreased dramatically. I recommend visiting here if you love seafood, also great for first dates. :)
First time at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  Service was excellent. We tried a pound of Louisiana style crawfish and a pound of fried shrimp.  Both were very good although there's not a lot of meat on each crawfish and they are not easy to peel, so you are left wishing you had ordered more.  A fun and unique place to go with a group and the utter messiness of it all is mitigated with the plastic aprons and gloves that the restaurant provides.  I recommend giving it a try.
If you love seafood and spices this is definitely a must!! We came around 4 and the place was packed the whole time we were there. Good service - they only serve beers and one wine, a Riesling, solely by the bottle. We got 1lb of crawfish 1 dungeness crab, and a few sides. All great tasting. You can get spice levels 1-5 on each dish.
My girlfriend and I stopped by this place last week, mainly because we saw the restaurant featured on Man vs. Food and because of the great reviews it gets on Yelp. Sadly, I was let down by Adam Richman and all of my fellow Yelpers.. . Shortly after we were seated, the waitress warned us that Hot N Juicy's spice levels were much higher than your "typical restaurant" and advised us to go for a lower spicy level when we ordered our shrimp. Taking her advice, we went with a milder sauce. We noticed a lot of things wrong when we got our shrimp:. . - There was absolutely no "juice" in the bag. We have been to similar restaurants where the shrimp/crawdads are served in the "juice" to give added flavor. Considering that this restaurant is called "Hot N Juicy", we were both expecting JUICY.. . - The shrimp had absolutely no flavor to them. It literally tasted like they boiled a bag of shrimp in water and served it to us. Again, considering that this restaurant is called "Hot N Juicy", we were both expecting HOT.. . We asked for a hotter sauce on the side to dip our shrimp in since we were let down by the sauce we ordered. The waitress was kind enough to come back with a small container of their "Hot N Juicy" sauce. This was also very subpar - it tasted like a blend of marinara sauce with a hint of Tabasco. Again, the sauce was not spicy at all. I think its important to note that my girlfriend and I aren't huge fans of spicy food. When we do order wings or shrimp, we tend to go for a medium level of spiciness due to our own sensitivities with spicy food. That being said, nothing in this restaurant (that we tried) is even remotely spicy.. . We also ordered a side of calamari. These were ok, but considering the price for the order it was not worth it. . . The only saving grace for this restaurant is the ambiance and decor. The restaurant itself has a cool modern look, is very well air conditioned (which is a big thing for me) and plays good music. I would come here to buy a beer but would stay the hell away from the food.
Spicy wasn't as spicy. Crawfish was a good size but not as BIG as everyone said it would be! Their sauce is really good and tasteful! Clams were meaty. Shrimp was a little overcooked and hard to peel. Great service!
Took my New Orleans-native girlfriend here after an unsatisfactory dinner at Lola's. Hoping to have a better experience...NOPE. The crawfish were mediocre (my GF thinks she could have made better with some old bay and frozen supermarket crawfish), the server didn't pay much attention to us, the cajun fries were WAY too spicy, and the lemonade was so sweet it was undrinkable. . . STILL looking for quality New Orleans cuisine and good service under one roof. If you know of a place, let me know!
Tuy is so sweet and always so friendly! She gives the best customer service and made my bambuu experience enjoyable! I come in just to order my drink! What a class act! My drink is delicious and the service is always pleasant!
Absolutely incredible Cajun food!  who knew the best Cajun food in Las Vegas are by the Chinese!  It's like the best Chinese food in TX is cooked by the Mexicans... haha..  Try it and you won't regret it.. Guaranteed!
This place is amazing!  Came here on Saturday before they opened so we could nab a parking space and were one of the first customers there.  It was our first time there so we got 2 lbs crawfish, a pound king crab legs, a pound of Dungeness crab and some Cajun fries.  We got the hot n juicy seasoning in medium and it was perfect!  Perhaps a bit salty for my taste but the flavors were explosive in a good way.  My tongue was dancing.  They use lots of garlic so you will smell like garlic afterwards.  Tip, if you use your bare hands, ask for some lemon wedges to wipe your fingers down to help tame the seafood and garlic smells before doing a final wash with soap and water.  Because soap and water alone isn't enough to combat the garlic!  I can eat spicy and the medium was spicy but not anything you can't handle.  My party doesn't eat too spicy so that's why we opted for the medium level.  But anywho, the crawfish that day was frozen but still they were so delicious!  The Dungeness crab was super juicy and soft.  Everything tasted so amazing that we put in another order of crawfish and crabs!  And we devoured about 11 lbs of shellfish altogether.  On top of that, we had fries and some baskets to wash it all down :). . . Wish there was a hot n juicy where I live.  Come here to satisfy your Cajun shellfish hunger and come early for parking, totally worth camping out for this joint in the hot desert heat!
