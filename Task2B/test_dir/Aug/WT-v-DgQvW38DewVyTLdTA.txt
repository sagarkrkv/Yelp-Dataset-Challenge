Bed bugs!  No joke!  Sorry for the grammar/spelling I am doing this on my phone.  First we arrive and the GPS took us to the hotel entrance where we used the valet with no issue.  We get in line for the check-in, took about 10 minutes, great!  Pulled the $20 sandwich trick, dude knew what we were doing, awesome.  We go up to our room and there is a manager lady inspecting the room.  She saw a small tear in the lamp shade and said she was going to replace it.  She left the room.  In the meanwhile we pulled back the sheets to find both beds had torn sheets and both had big stains, but they were clean.  We go into the bathroom to find that the ceiling is leaking above the shower head.  It was a huge bubble and was dripping pretty fast into our tub.  I called the front desk and they told me to sit tight engineering will be there in 45 minutes.  I requested a new room and they asked that I stay until engineering gets there.   Engineering shows up and so does the manager lady.  Engineering says yup, you guys may want to get a new room.  Manager lady got a bellhop to bring us keys to our new room after another 30 min wait.  So we move rooms, tired and cranky but they took care of it.  We get to our new room and it looks great.  Until my nephew went to look out the window and found 3 used Q tips laying on the floor where he was standing.  I was grossed out as was my wife and nephew.  I went to the hallway to tell the house keeper who could not understand me or the things I was saying.  I got frustrated and went back to my room to call the manager.  They were sending housekeeping and the housekeeping manager.  In the meantime my wife stepped on a staple and we found 4 more thick gauge staples around the room.  Housekeeping arrives picks up the Q tips and says sorry.  They leave.  Still a little grossed out.  By this time it's been 2 hours since check-in so the wife and nephew went to bed and I went to gamble.  It took me a bit to find the casino floor as the signs were not clear, but I finally found it.  It was way to cramped so I never even sat down and headed to the Rio.  When I came back it was much later and I decided to sit down to enjoy some blackjack.  Table was nice, dealer was nice, rules were the norm and they only had $10 tables.  The other players were pretty unsavory characters.   There was definitely some gang affiliations going on with-in that casino and not just one.  So I retire for the evening to my room and went to sleep.  It was quiet and a decent bed.  I woke up the next morning and went to take a shower.  The tub was filling much faster than the drain could keep up which grosses me and my wife out.  So I finished and told my wife, she didn't want to shower in there.  As I am getting dressed my wife is out of the bed and says eew a bug on our sheet.  She goes to flick it off and I said wait.  And I got down and looked at it and said "do you know what that is?"  She says no, it's not a bed bug is it?   Now I have only heard of these but have never seen one, thanks to the power of Google I Google'd it.  Sure enough it was a dead bed bug!  I was irate!  I called the front desk and demanded to speak with a manager immediately! They connect me to a supervisor who I told I found a bed bug and I wanted to cancel my room for the night and wanted a full refund for both nights!   He offered me a refund for the next night but wouldn't give me one for the previous until there is an investigation of the bed bug which could take 10 days.  He then Sent security to the room to start the investigation with written complaints and pictures of the bed bug.  When we went to check out I found the supervisor and asked him if he had see the pictures, he said yes.  I said is it what I thought it was, he said he was legally not allowed to say and I could find my answer if I Google'd it.  I said I want my money back for last night now.  Again he said he couldn't.  I said what if I stood here in your lobby and started showing people the picture? He said he would have the police escort me off the property.   So I left peacefully and went to the mgm grand for the next night.  This was just a terrible experience and will never go back.  It's been 13 days and still no refund.  I will try to add a photo!
Photo booth at the park - Lying to people stating the package is only $30, charging $31.46 asking why they charge more after they just told me it is $30, Katie (the manager) and Mariah told me the 1.46 is for "tax", but they charge additional tax... She then explain her boss was asking her to lie about it - unbelievable
Vehicle was broken into while parked in their lot. Punched the lock and when I tried to tell security for a report they looked dumbfounded. Eventually they took one but not happy with situation. Obviously security officers on duty not patrolling. . . Room was clean and non smoking but smelled really bad as if someone smoked in it. Family next door with 5 kids screaming and jumping kept us up all hours of the night. . . Kids loved the games and amenities. Price was good but what I saved on the hotel I am now paying in a vehicle damage deductible :(
The only reason it got 1 star was for the price and free circus acts which I haven't seen yet. The non smoking rooms are mixed with the smoking rooms so you smell the smoke. The wallpaper is peeling and the tub/shower is breaking apart. The rooms smell musty. Very inconvenient parking and access to the monorail. During our stay the fire alarm went off at 4 am with no announcement so we thought there was a fire. We pack our things quickly only to find it's a false alarm. The hallway smells strongly of marijuana, and so someone had set off the fire alarm due to smoking. I called the front desk and had to wait 20 minutes for them to answer and all they say is "sorry" and "people are allowed to smoke it with a prescription but if you can smell it in your non smoking room, we will send security to investigate." Wow, what great customer service. I will never stay here again. Also, the buffet is like hometown buffet but twice the price. And it is supposed to be kid-friendly but everywhere you walk the smell of smoke overpowers you. I would never bring my child here.
Yes, this IS the ghetto of the Strip.  Smelly, sketchy and very cheap. . . HOWEVER, if you're in Vegas with kids it's a must visit.  The Midway and Arcade are a blast for the little ones.  Total throw back to the shady carnival games of a day gone by (in a good way).  Toss in the free trapeze acts and my 8 & 10 year olds had a ton of fun.. . That alone earned 2 stars from me.  Just wash your hands when you leave.  ;)
The circus circus is a very kid friendly hotel with with the adventure dome and midway arcade. The arcade and adventure dome is very enjoyable as fir the rooms they were decent not the greates but ok. The casino is very smokey and dirty.
Je n'avais pas choisi mon hotel, alors forcement... J'avais un peu peur. J'avais raison. Je suis un peu mechante avec cette note, mais en soit, j'ai pas du tout aime ma chambre:. - trop kitsch. - trop vieillot. - trop chelou (je sais ca vous aide vachement a visualiser ma chambre ca). . L'emplacement de l'hotel etait vraiment pas top par rapport au Strip, tout au nord. Alors, c'est cool parce qu'au final j'etais pas loin de la stratosphere mais bon, j'y suis allee qu'une fois, et tant qu'a etre a Vegas, autant etre au cur de l'animation! Bref decue de chez decue.. . Bon, le casino est normal, rien de folichon. En revanche, et ce qui releve la note, c'est le buffet ! Un buffet petit dejeuner comme j'en ai rarement vu: vous pouvez manger ABSOLUMENT TOUT ce qui vous fait envie!. Donut? Checked!. Muffin? Checked!. Pave de saumon? Checked!. Oeufs benedict? Checked!. Pates? Checked!. . Un buffet IM-PRE-SSION-NANT qui vaut a lui tout seul sa petite etoile.. Sinon, ben... allez-y si TOUS les autres hotels de Vegas sont complets, y a largement mieux a faire et pour des prix similaires.
Overall, It's a dive, but inexpensive and the kids had fun on the rides and playing games. We had a smoke free room but it still smelled like smoke. Rooms are low end looking. Plumbing was awful. I would probably pay a few extra bucks and stay some place else and if you have kids, swing by for a few hours to hit the rides and games.
For lack of a better word, all I have to say about this place is "yucky.". . Parking is horrendous. Spaces are tight and the parking structure is filthy. Upon entering the hotel, you get the familiar stench of cigarette smoke. No ventilation like the newer hotels. While walking through the casino, some spots are super cold and some are warm. I remember staying here when we would go on family vacations, but I would definitely stay away from here now. . . Let's get to the arcade area since that's where we spent the majority of our time. Let's just say that I've never been more grossed out in a while. SO. MANY. PEOPLE.. Gross!!! I didn't want to touch anything. Lots of spoiled little brats running around unsupervised. And why are kids these days so fat??? Oh I know, cuz their parents are fat too and don't care about being healthy. I get that kids want to have fun too, but this place is disgusting.
Went on a road trip and spontaneously decided to go to Vegas. Looked online for a family hotel and chose Circus circus! Great place to stay at if you have kids. The circus shows were interesting and entertaining. The arcade and games were pretty cheap. The hotel itself was decent although the shower kept on getting clogged haha. The adventure some was perfect for my nieces. They enjoyed the rides. Tons of gift shops and food places. Super close to the Strop! Walkable to other places!
I really don't get the bad rap this hotel is getting.  I was very heistant to stay here because of all the bad reviews but my wife said we should check it out for the kids.  To say the least we had a great time.  I spent $80 on a room for two nights, including a $20 food voucher, a coupon for $45 in chips for $30 and numerous other coupons.  We spent around $85 total on an all day passes for the adventuredome  for 4 people and we loved it.  The hotel was extremely crowded but it did not smell like smoke and in fact my wife and I agreed the hotel seemed as clean as any other hotel we stayed at in Vegas.  I was up at 4am walking around jetlagged and I could not believe the cleaning that was taking place.  Guys on their hands and knees scrubbing the lobby carpet and one guy cleaning every stair on the escalator, one by one.  Our room was extremely clean and newly remodeled and the bed was very comfortable. Some of the hallway carpets were a little worn and the gym is sub-par, but my take is that for $40 per night it does not get much better and easily 5 stars at this price point.  My kids are already asking if we can go back.
Had a blast with my fiance. . Went to the arcade had a blast.. Got the most prizes in my life.. Shopping there can make you gk broke cause theres just way to many cute stores with to many cute items lol. Cool show different and free everytime cant beat it.. Get a nice tall margeritra and have fun
I did read many negative reviews but for the price I really didn't care. I think some people book last minute get a hike in price for doing so and then complain because it's "ghetto". That's probably because it's cheap, affordable and attractive to families with children . This is the first time I have stayed at the hotel with my 3 children and for the 70 dollars I paid for a Saturday was great and couldn't be beat.I can't lie..the decor needs an upgrade, especially the bathroom but we weren't planning on staying all day staring at mismatched colors. There are casinos, restaurants, circus shows, Adventure Dome, shops and a pretty spacious pool. I did hear that if you book last minute the chances of being sent to the motorlodge was high and from the remarks, I'm guessing it's pretty scrappy over there. I stayed in the skytower with the kids and they loved every minute. If you don't want to be around a bunch of teens, children or obnoxious people....and want "luxury", then I suggest to drive a bit more south to other hotels. You'll find ghetto and sketchy people all up and down the strip regardless. From my point of view and in my opinion, the price was right, children had a blast and didn't cost me an arm or a leg.. . Update--08/17/2014. My original review was placed on our first night. I felt like I need to update this place after my first night stay. This might be funny to some and perhaps serious to others, but I think my room was haunted. I took a shower and put the kids down, organized a few things before I slipped into the bed. I turned off the lights and closed my eyes. I was woken up by what seemed like something jumping on the bed, so I jumped up and turn on the lights but there was nothing there. I thought maybe it was part of a dream that had wake me up, so I just went back to sleep. I had the most creepy feeling ever and as a mother of three sleeping children..my nerves were on edge. Again, I heard something in the corner of the room so I just turned on the lights and left it on. I called down to the front desk and didn't want to seem like a crazy person, so I asked if there were any other rooms available. I was told they were completely booked and they apologized. It was about 1:45am when I went to sleep (again) and was woken up by a huge bang  at 3:17am (mind you the light in the bathroom was left on) and when I stood up..everything on the table was now on the floor!! MY Purse, bag, ipad, papers from check in and a cup of juice. All of it on the floor, almost as if the table tipped over -_-. Needless to say, I ended up just staying up turning on another light and opening the blinds. I ended up dozing off at 7am and the sun was coming up so I felt a bit at ease. At exactly 8:15am, I hear someone trying to open the door. I went to look through the peep hole and it was one of three housekeepers in the hall way. She apologized and said she had the wrong room!! Are you freaking kidding me??? First the angry ghost and then the early bird housekeeper. Checkout is at 11am thank you very much. SO.....Sleep at your own risk lol. I am now home and on 3 hrs of sleep. I now have a love ..hate thing with Circus Circus.
I am SO happy I did not really care to pay attention to many of the negative reviews on Circus Circus! Complain about walking? Really? This is Vegas! You walk, you eat, you gamble, you have fun, and you visit other hotels just wishing you could afford one of those rooms for a couple days!!!!! DUH! I'll just tell you my experience. I went with my 6 year old and my husband from Sunday to Wednesday. This hotel with flight included cost under $400 each. Not only was it affordable (one reason to not compare it to other hotels on the strip DUH #1) but it also gave us spending money to go visit the Adventuredome which was SOOOOO MUCH fun! That costed $25 each and we went and came back later after taking a stroll down the strip. There are a lot of families which equates to LOTS of kids, cousins, grandmas, and uncles around because it is family friendly (another reason to not compare it to other hotels on the strip DUH #2). We also went to eat at THE STEAK HOUSE and OMG, I had the best filet mignon I had ever eaten and I have been to a lot of fancy steak houses. It did cost $52 but it included a delish salad which included beets and orange tomatoes. Along with two sides. We also ate at some of the more affordable places such as the Blue Iguana and the Pizzaria. I just would NOT go to Vince Neil's spot. The margaritas were horrible along with the service and the chicken fingers my husband threw up after 30 minutes of eating them. Either way, I appreciate the affordability and quality of food for the other spots. My husband also gambled at the $3 Blackjack table! He had so much fun because once again...this place is affordable. (DUH #3). I did not give it five stars because the pool is lacking some updating but it was still a decent pool, however remodeling it in the near future may help with the visual aspect of Circus Circus. In the end, ALWAYS wash your hands whether at Circus Circus or the Bellagio and I would definitely come back...only with kids.
Salon @ Circus Circus - Let Down You're Hair Salon. OMG where can I start...?. I called and spoke with the lady that does the manicures & pedicures (Desiree) made an appointment for the next morning with her.  I arrived 10 minutes early for my 9:30am appt.  This chick shows up @ 10am.  She gives me some excuse.  Honey thats not my problem.  You had my # you could have called me to tell me you were running late.. . No receptionist, so she is constantly answering the phone while she is suppose to be doing my pedicure.  . . She is unorganized.  Didn't know the correct steps to apply the "gel" polish.. . At my regular salon it only takes 45 minutes for a pedicure.  I wasted almost 1-1/2 dealing with this woman.  Desiree, you do not know what you are doing!    . . They say they take walk-ins...but no one works there.  1 hairstylist & 1 manicurist.  Slow staff.  This place is unorganized and not kept up very well.  . . I WILL NOT BE BACK & I WILL STRONGLY SUGGEST NO ONE VISITING VEGAS GO THERE.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!
To be honest with everybody it doesn't worth it to pay for this hotel, try to pay 20$ or 50$ more and get a nicer hotel I stayed here for one night only and I couldn't get my wifi set up then then were trying to send a technician to set it up and I waited about 3 hours and then called them back and the guy was lost or something nobody could find him, then set up the wifi myself cause I know a little in adjusting thing with electronics but listen not everyone can do it!!! Then the internet was f*cking slow as f*ck!!! I couldn't even open a YouTube to watch some bullshit things, then when I tried to go to sleep with the tv on I saw spider coming down to my pillow, I was freaking out like probably there is something else from the world of insects lives in this room, then I called the the guest services and they told they gonna send me housekeeper, I was like for what does she eats insects or what?!:/ and then nobody eventually came to my room, in this whole situation I was so exhausted and tired and lazy that I didn't have any will to change my room even if it was possible, so my experience was too bad twice in this hotel, the good thing is now I am at MGM grand I got a small room with the same king bed and I think it looks perfect for me... So make ur decisions right and take the responsibility of ur choices in front of ur family or ur second half) good luck
Yay! no smoking allowed anymore, me and the kids can finally breathe!. . The Midway is full of fun games but prepare to lose lots of money and come back with a lot of stuffed animals for all your little cousins. . Don't forget to watch a couple of free performances, all of which are pretty good for free (ppl juggling with feet and trapeze acts)
SKIP IT.. We stayed here because my Mom wanted to relive her childhood visits. . As soon as we walked in I wanted to leave, once we entered our room, we strongly considered leaving. It was OLD and gross. It is unfortunate since this Hotel could be very pretty and fun. It just needs a re-vamp. BADLY.. . Although, this is a kid friendly hotel. I warn you to be prepared for a kid invasion. This is the hotel that parents drop their kids off at to go to the casino and walk the strip. They run rampant and loudly.
This hotel is not very expensive and all in all it's OK. Nice for kids, pool is OK, we've been treated well, just minus 1 because the non-smoking room still smelled (ex smoking room i suppose). . Tip: there is a very good mexican reastaurant just around the corner, the El Dorado Cantina
I Checked in the Manor Lodge, room was extremely bad, very old, not renovated nor maintained Long time ago. Place is smelly and bathroom wasn't good. The room rate itself was moderated but all other activities and facilities in the hotel are expensive. Food quality is not good in the buffet bur the steak house us good and expensive in t he same time.
90% of the time I come to Vegas I stay here. It's simple and very affordable. Key tip is book the West tower. It's the closest to the valet. You won't encounter the large amount of kids like you would in the Manor lodge and Skyrise plus those have no valet.
The rooms are old and even did not have flat TV. Parking is freaking horrible. It is a low class hotel casino. If you have kids is OK place to stay.
God, what the hell happened to this place?  Remember when we were kids, and our parents would take us here to mask their gambling?  "Oh, son, take these quarters and go play on the midway!"  I'd be all excited, but I knew what mom and dad were doing. They were gambling my college fund away!!!  But then I felt complicit because I took their $20 and played Simpsons until I got carpel tunnel syndrome.  Either way, it was cool meeting other kids whose parents were also gambling away their college funds.. . Flash forward to today.  Circus Circus is ghetto as shit.  There's still families there, but it's NOT the kind of place I'd want to take my family.  There's seedy people all over the casino, and lots of people were angry and yelling. Also, the midway is now disgusting. It makes me think I have MRSA or something.  . . Blech, don't go here unless all you want is super cheap gambling and shadiness.  If you want to give your kids the amusement park experience, take them to New York, New York or just walk up and down the strip.  Don't give them sad memories that they'll hate you for and that will lead them to drug and alcohol addiction.  Trust me, it's not worth it.
We've stayed here quite a few times in the last 10 years and have always been happy with our stay. . . A detailed review about our many stays..... . Check in: is usually quite quick but make sure you're checking in at check in time especially on a holiday or a weekend as rooms may not be ready. Staff is usually friendly but I've had a few times where they weren't. Hey, everyone's allowed a bad day right? . . Kids: yes, there are lots of unsupervised children running around acting like children. This is a hotel geared towards families so if running, screaming, playing children bother you then it might be best to consider another place to stay. The adventure dome is a lot of fun for both adults and children. The games and attractions are pretty cheap and your normal run of the mill circus games. . . Rooms: we've stayed in many different types of rooms and you are best off to avoid the manor rooms as they are a walk from the casino and main entrance. There used to be a mono rail type thing that crossed the casino but I don't think it's in operation anymore. We mostly stay in suites now since my players club card either comps the room or makes it very cheap. I do love the suites! They're large, clean, have a wonderful whirlpool tub and are a little more updated then other rooms. . . Food: there are dining options for every taste and price point. The steakhouse is the best by far I've eaten at on the strip. The portions are huge, the food is excellent and the decor is nice. I've used points towards meals here and paid $7.00 for 2 prime rib dinners within appetizer,dessert and cocktails. The Mexican/Italian resturant is unique in selections and is pretty good for American Mexican/Italian food. I haven't had anything that I was disappointed in eating and I'm a foodie. . . Casino/comps/games: one of the most annoying things I ever experienced here was being carded to the point I felt almost harassed. I was carded twice before I even made it to the bar and then a bartender called security on my very valid California ID acting like it was fake. They asked if I had any other forms of ID which I had to go to my room to get and then acted suspicious of my civilian ID from a military base. Two valid government issued IDs and they still acted if I was under age and trying to pull something on them....I was 25 at the time. Another bartender asked me my year of birth, when I graduated high school and other questions that I felt kind of harassed by also to verify my age. this only happened at one stay and they may have been on a strict ID policy or had an age issue recently happen. Still very annoying to the point I began playing across the street which hurt my points and comp ability. . . It's a regular run of the mill casino, typical games. I do like playing slots on the carasouel and I'm not a big slot player. . . This hotel comps very very well. I play table games 90% of the time, roulette, craps and a little blackjack. I was very pleased with after just 2 days of playing I had enough points to pay for a $95 dinner at the steakhouse. . . Yes, this hotel needs a pick me up and make over but as those of us with kids know....you don't get kids really nice things because they tear them up. I understand the hotel not spending millions of dollars to have children tear up everything. . . I've never had issues with my car but I always vallet, it's worth it to me. I've never had any issues with vallet or the bell hops. The staff is usually very helpful and polite. . . The hotel is located at the end of the strip and is closer to Freemont street then the strip in my opinion. It's a fun place to stay for a decent price. . . It's worth the extra bucks to upgrade to a suite and to vallet/bell your bags. If the children bother you then avoid the adventure dome and kids eateries. Also, try and avoid the first few weeks and last few weeks of summer as that's when it's most over run by kids. If you're expecting a fancy hotel/casino like other places on the strip then you will be disappointed. Don't be afraid to let the front desk know if you're not happy with the room as they have always been helpful in correcting or relocating in my experience. Even if you don't stay or play here the steakhouse is must when in Vegas, it's seriously some of the best food and service I've ever had.
Good fun for kids at adventure dome.. No place to sit for non players . Not possible to sit and eat com comfortably.
