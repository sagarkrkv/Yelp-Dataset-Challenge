upon reading other reviews - sad to see this place has closed.  The desserts were phenominal.  Rich fresh made chocolates.  Taking desserts to a whole new level of flavor, flair, and design.  It was literally eating art.  Perfect balances of sweet and salty - matched with amazingly balanced textures.  . . Max - I don't know where you went or where you have gone but please don't stop chasing your dream of creating sweet memories for people to eat!
