I'll start by saying the food is probably worth 5 stars. . . The chocolate was great as expected. For 2.25 a piece, they better be. I had the Gringo (dark chocolate coffee with caramel), Chiquita (banana, milk chocolate), and Earl Grey. All were smooth and tasted exactly as they were made to be tasted. . . I also had their Cafe Latte and Americano. Great coffees. Very pricey. About 6 dollars for a small of each. . . Here's where the bad part comes in: the service. The cashiers are EXTREMELY rude. Yes, I get that you must be tired and whatnot, but this is your job. I'm a waitress and I know how shitty food service is, but it really isn't that hard to smile and hand food out behind a counter. One female cashier was just yelling at people that the line was whatever way... The store layout is straight up terrible. Very confusing and MADE to make people look like idiots. Not the customer's faults. . . Great food without the service to match.
Too touristy for me-its in all the right locations and they have the beautiful chocolate fountain to draw you in but nothing I had here (chocolate or crepe) really impressed me too much. I'd have to say it's overrated!
This place is like a dried up watering hole in the oasis that is Aria, like a cold sore on the mouth of a beautiful woman, like a....you get the point. . . The food and drinks are ehhhhh. Expensive and subpar is never a good start but here's the biggest issue: this place is *always* understaffed. This leads to both unnecessarily long waits for the aforementioned subpar expensive eats/drinks AND a forever scrambling staff that doesn't have time to be friendly.. . Aria, I love you (Vegas love, not real love, just trashy temporary love) please put some Abreva on the cold sore that is this place and hire some more people. Oh and improving the quality of the food and drink wouldn't hurt either.
Order the almond croissant and don't waste your time with anything else (~$4).  Well, if you're gonna linger, try to score the free chocolates that spits out of the big clock in the middle of the store every 15 minutes.. . Other important info: skip the macarons and everything else there and only order the almond croissant, the big clock in the middle of the store spits out free chocolate every 15 minutes, they have a cafe express store a few feet away from this main store.
Food, drinks and dessert selection are pretty decent, if not slightly overpriced for what it's worth, but having to wait there for 10 minute in front of the counter before placing an order while the clerk leisurely made a smoothie for someone who cut in line left little to desire.. . Wait, lemme rephrase, there isn't any line system at all, very disorganized. Clerks merely call out "who's next" and proceed to randomly choose a customer they *felt* like was next, even if there were other customers standing in front of them idly waiting for ages.. . Service:1, actual food:4
this place is amazing, it's pricey but worth every $. I got the brulee w/mixed berries and a Stracciatella gelato. Hands down best gelato i've ever had
Really fancy desserts. I had a strawberry croissant. It was okay.
Crepes!!!. . If you are here, try the crepes with Ice-Cream. The pastries are all good and french authentic.. . Lots of candies and pick a box of your taste. . Not to miss
Fresh chocolates, chocolate muffin, regular palmier and croissant were delicious. Being a coffee lover, I really enjoyed the milk chocolate coffee truffle! Visited here three times during our stay in Vegas and the customer service was bad every time.
Be warned - these crepes are not handheld crepes.  They are so large, they are in a full takeaway container! I had expected to be able to carry my crepe from the Bellagio to the Cosmopolitan.  Whoops!. . I got the Italian crepe - which had proscuitto, mozzarella cheese, and pesto.  It was good - hell, I was starving, so anything would have been good - but there wasn't too much to it.  Since the crepe was so large, I got sick of the taste after a while.  The BF got the Exotic Sweet Crepe, which had mango and pineapple pieces in a sauce on top of the crepe.  The crepe was finished off with coconut ice cream.  It was delicious and definitely much better than the "savory" crepe.. . This is definitely the place for a quick coffee and breakfast if you don't want to head to Starbucks, which I do in addition to my patisserie stop!  They also have gelato too and the famous chocolate fountain!
The chocolate at jean philippe is amazing.  This location has different boxes than at bellagio.  The ones here are blue.  When I was there they had some unique chocolate sculptures on display.  Near this hotel are a couple of art galleries worth checking out - sculptures and glass.
I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and it totally exceeded my expectations. . I ordered a custom cake on a Monday for that Friday and they got it done! I emailed back and forth with a gentleman named Duke and he was on point. I sent him a photo of the cake I wanted with some minor changes and it looked even better than I imagine. . More importantly, it tasted amazing. Vanilla cake with strawerry brulee and fresh strawberries. Everyone loved it! . I would recommend Jean Phillipe anytime you need a special occasion cake in Vegas. . Bravo!
The baked goods are outstanding! We had a cinnamon roll warmed up.  Went there both mornings we were at the aria! A little pricey, but worth every penny!
Came here last night after having an early dinner at the other end of the strip and yet again, despite the fact that my favorite croissant was sold out, I ordered a cheese Danish and the taste was still fantastic even though it had been made earlier in the day.. . OAN - I passed by JP's other location in the Bellagio which is much smaller although they do have a nice flowing chocolate fall display. If you have never been to the JP locations, I recommend going to the one in the Aria to get the full "sweets" experience!. . In closing, for those of you who live in the San Francisco area, this particular location probably rivals Belinda Leong's patisserie in the Upper Fillmore area of the city.
Stayed at the Aria because my friend had her bachelorette in Vegas and was excited to see that there was a Jean Philippe Patisserie! This location is not the one with the chocolate fountain (that one is at the Bellagio) but it is larger and has a nice seating area. . . Jean-Philippe Maury is amazing with desserts. He had a mentorship with Chef Gerard Bertin (recipient of the "Meilleur Ouvrier de France," the most prestigious pastry award in France), won the Best Pastry Chef of France in 1997, won the Gold Medal in the 2002 World Pastry Team Championship as a member of Team USA, and many other awards. He also worked with Chef Francois Paillard as a pastry chef for his restaurant and shop.. . Our Order:. Croque Monsieur: Baked Ham & cheese topped w/ Parmesan. White Cafe Mocha. Pistachio Macron. Chocolates: Earl Grey, Lemon Tart, Pistachio, Dark Chocolate w/Hazelnut. . I typically don't order croque monsier because they're so easy to make but my friend didn't eat breakfast so I wanted to get him something. What's unique is that on the outside of the bread, Parmesan is baked onto it so it had so much more flavor. It was surprisingly good!. . The White Cafe Mocha was on the sweet side but very yummy. There were bits of white chocolate inside as well!. . The pistachio macron didn't have an overpowering flavor. The cookie itself was very soft and slightly chewy.. . The chocolates were all very creamy and smooth. Highly suggest eating right away as they do no hold up in heat at all. The layer in the caramel inside the Darke Chocolate w/ Hazelnut was amazing. EXTREMELY soft and not too sticky or chewy. Made me wish I had bought the mix of caramels (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like caramels much!). . Will definitely come back as they also sell gelato and crepes! Plus they're open late! :D
Pretty expensive for just dessert and pastries, but hey everything is expensive in Vegas. This location is better than the one at the Bellagio, that one is hard to find and hidden near where all the conference rooms are at. This one is bigger and much easier to find.  Love how they have different stations for everything. I have to admit the pastries, Macarons and other treats are to die for, you can get a crazy sugar rush from just standing in this sugar store. Will definitely be back for more deliciousness.
Jean Philippe Patisserie is such an exquisite store that a sweets lover cannot help but stop in his or her track and go in and see what wonders await. . . I am a sweets lover and was drawn by their beautiful chocolate creations. Unfortunately, this stop occurred during an afternoon stroll along the Strip. I so wanted to get a box of chocolates, but I was practical enough to know that the desserts will not have a chance against the desert. I will be back next time I am in town and satisfy my want for those chocolates.. . With that in mind, this review is really just for the gelato. Perhaps after the visual treat, my expectations were very high, but I found their gelato to be just alright. The dulce de leche was too sweet, and almost cloying. The liquor-soaked pastry in the tiramisu would have made it an instant winner had the gelato it came with been able to hold its own, but it did not.. . I will go back to try the other exquisite things I saw in the shelves.
