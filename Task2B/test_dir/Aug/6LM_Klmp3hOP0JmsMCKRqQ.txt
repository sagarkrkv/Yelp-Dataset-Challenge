This place works. I thought from the other reviews my room in the pyramid was going to be decrepit. It's not. It's spacious, nothing flashy but comfortable. I walked in and said out loud: this will work! And for the price? I'm more than glad to be right on the strip during the summer on a big boxing match weekend for a really reasonable cost. (Thanks Kayak). . What's better is the actual hotel decor and scale. Great places to eat... Other reviews, stop complaining. If you want the Bellagio, cough up Bellagio dollars. I can think of a bunch of other Vegas hotels that the Luxor far exceeds - think Riviera, Excalabur, Sahara. The old crusty ones.. . I'd put the Luxor on the same level as MGM Grand, maybe slightly less updated than the Mandalay Bay but only by a little bit. Point is, I'd come back for sure and save my money unless the Wynn is having a crazy sale.
Not the fanciest resort on the strip but you can get a hell of a deal here if you try. Booked a pyramid queen room for a great weekend rate and was upgraded without much effort to a tower king room with a view of the pool. The tower rooms are very nice and spacious and are not showing their age yet. Location is good, connected to Mandalay bay and Excalibur. Tons of dining locations if you need to grab a quick bite and two evening calls nearby are handy when you need your thirst quenched!
I stayed at Luxor for work and it's a bit of a mixed bag.  Of course, since my company is paying, I would prefer to stay somewhere nicer like Mandalay, but it is what it is.. . I stayed in the pyramid with 2 Queen beds.  The room was really spacious and had a nice Flat Screen TV.  That seems to be what the judge of a room is.  I stayed on the 25th floor and had nice views inside the casino from my hallway and outside the window.  Luxor is a little off the beaten path, but it's a nice hotel with interesting features.  The price is right - you can usually get a room for $30-60 a night even on the busiest of nights.. . The 2 biggest drawbacks I had to staying at Luxor is that I had a room that was West facing.  The sun, setting in the west, beat on my windows all day and the room was like 90 degrees.  No joke!  This was with the drapes completely closed.  If they were open, it would have been over 110 degrees inside, without exaggeration.. . This leads me to the 2nd drawback, which is the antiquated AC unit.  It wasn't powerful enough to keep up, so no matter how high I had it turned on, the room was not cooling down.  My advice is to request a room that is facing one of the other directions and you will be good to go.  I don't remember my room #, but it was directly opposite the check in desk, so maybe request a room that is above the check in desk.. . I know that seems OCD, but it will make a huge difference in your stay.
I had heard great things about this hotel, but was severely disappointed in the state of the hotel and the way we were treated by the staff. The casino floor was clean, but the hallway on our hotel room floor was a disaster. There was garbage left in the hallway for days at a time (we stayed for a week). This was sort of surprising as we encountered our housekeeper multiple times-- she did a fantastic job with our room and was very friendly! When we first entered our room, we had burnt out lightbulbs, cabinet handles that were only halfway screwed into the cabinet doors, and only 1 of the 3 phones in the room had a dial tone. We would wake up in the mornings and our headboard would be hot, as if there was a heater behind it. Unfortunately, our AC did not work in the bedroom, only in the outer room, which was nearly unbearable in the June heat. Any time we called down to the front desk to ask about getting our AC fixed, the staff treated us like children and gave us the run around, neversending anyone to fix our AC nor find us another room.. We were also harassed by salespeople anytime we walked across the casino floor, trying to lock us into booking rooms for next year. It is difficult to remain polite towards unassuming salespeople after the 50th time you're asked to come back-- especially when you're having a terrible stay. The deal being offered made the hotel seem desperate and tacky, as if scrambling not to go broke.. Also, the pool was really gross.. . And, word of warning: there is NO WIFI. You can't even purchase it daily. Although, if your room is close enough to one of the neighboring hotels, you can sometimes pick up their wifi. I had intended to work during the downtime of our trip, but was not able. It's 2014, Luxor, pull it together!
I came here for my 21st birthday. I honestly have no idea what these other Yelpers are whining and complaining about. If you want to get treated like a spoiled princess, don't pay 30-something a night.... pay whatever ridiculous price Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio charge. I stayed in the pyramid deluxe room, and believe me, it was more than deluxe!. . Everything from check-in to check-out was absolutely amazing and went smoothly. My boyfriend and I were having so much fun, we purchased another night! The EveningCall frozen slushie bar was amazing, I had a Jack Daniels (which I was amazed that they had). The Luxor gives you a coupon book, and there's an option for this bar, so definitely use it. There's even coupons in there for a buy one get one free jewelry, shots at other bars, club entry, and even $20 off the fanciest restaurants the Luxor and Excalibur have to offer! . . The room? 5-star quality to me! I mean, they didn't have a fridge, but you can literally ask for one to be brought up to you if you so desperately needone. I found the pyramid shaped soap incredibly adorable! A bit awkward to wash your hands with haha the monorail connected the three hotels (Luxor, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay), and that made things incredibly convenient. These three are a bit away from the strip, but don't go to Vegas if you want to be lazy and not walk around. (I saw a lot of reviews docking the Luxor because of this....absolutely ridiculous. Get a limo to drive your lazy butts around if you don't want to walk around.). . Our AC worked perfectly! In fact, I had to get under the covers a few times because it worked so well haha I will agree with some of the sour people reviewing: there is limited to no wifi... but you're not there to be on the internet, you're there to enjoy company in Vegas, baby!!. . Sorry for the dissertation, I just wanted to cover all of the points other people were complaining about.. . UPDATE: One more thing others were whining about: the elevator. You're staying in A PYRAMID. The elevator has to ascend in an angle. I found it fun and exciting. Those of you who are that high strung to dock a hotel for a "slightly rickety" elevator are ridiculous! I bet you being drunk added to the shakiness! It truly wasn't that bad, these people are blowing it all out of proportion. If you don't like elevators, don't stay at the Luxor. I mean, come on.
The worst hotel experience I have ever had in Vegas.. . My husband and I paid for the players suite for a weekend getaway in Vegas.  When we got to our room we found: . . 1.) The couches and chairs had sketchy stains on them . 2.) the TV was tilted on the wall. 3.) The lamp shades were broken. 4.) All of the furniture was scratched and much of it was broken.. . Generally, we would have just dealt with it, but because we paid extra for the suite-- we decided to complain.  The manager didn't want to do anything but the woman at registration upgraded us to a pyramid suite.  excited to finally get our vegas weekend started we lugged our bags to our next room and found:. . 1.) The room was meh.  Old furniture.  Nothing special. . . 2.) The spa jacuzzi was not a jacuzzi at all-- just an oversized tub.  When I couldn't figure out how to drain the water-- i hoped that house keeping would know what to do.  I was sadly mistaken.  The water in the tub sat for 3 days-- which made me wonder how clean the hotel really was. . . 3.) At night, the horizontal elevators in the hotel were so loud and they shook our hotel room-- yes, every 10 minutes it was like an earthquake in the room.  . . On top of it all the customer service at the Luxor is lacking.  It is the only hotel that I have ever stayed in (EVER) where you have to wait in a mile long line just to give your bags to the bell man.  . . All in all-- will never stay at the Luxor again.  If you are looking for a cheaper hotel night-- the sister Casino Escaliber is a much better deal.
I really did enjoy my stay here except the elevators were a little questionable! The pool was great too. Just don't go see the cris angel show..it was dumb.
The hotel design is awesome and there's so much to do inside the hotel but my room really sucked and the bathroom looked like it hadn't been updated in decades. It took 4 flushes to flush a small poop. It's also really smelly in some areas of the hotel, but it's such a big place, it's understandable. They can't keep the entire place smelling nice. Also a majority of the tables were closed for most of the weekend. All in all its a decent hotel,  with an ok casino, in an ok location. Just ok.
We stayed in the tower suites, awesome room, beautiful view. The staff was great, did our dry cleaning for our wedding clothes.  Room service was great, little pricey but good food & very convenient.  We did gamble there, the casino was nice, had some luck, but best was on Freemont St.
We booked the hotel one day before for 59$  per night + taxes etc. (one day earlier it was 89$ per night). The upgraded room was a tower luxury suite. I liked the safe that was in the room. The beds were very soft. Unfortunately the Wifi was not accessible from the hotel room. The pool area is okay but you have to be there early to get a good place. Over all it was a very good experience
I have stayed at Luxor twice, in July my family of 5 stayed for a week.  The only reason I am not giving a 5 star review is because we had to switch rooms, our bed was overly soft felt like we were sinking...as soon as I called the front desk, they were very apologetic and switched us rooms immediately the front desk was very nice they even gave  us a free buffet meal for  5 for the inconvenience!! My kids loved how it was Egypt theme and the slanted tower rooms give it a cool affect! I would stay here again, we were very comfortable in the room!!
Stayed here August 3-6. Upon arrival the Valet service was overwhelmed due to the uncommon down pour at the time but did well considering the conditions. We had a king size bed reserved, but at check in only a two queen bed room was available. Once in the room it had a musky smell and water leaking from the ceiling. The following morning was able to switch rooms and was placed in the east tower and the room was a vast improvement. The one downfall is the lack of wifi in guest rooms when your paying a resort fee (wifi only available on casino floor). Even Motel 6 down the street has wifi. Lastly to smooth things over we were given a 50 dollar voucher for their buffet at More.
This is an awesome looking casino and hotel  from the outside with the black pyramid and makes for great pictures. Inside there are plenty of shops to check out and they have a pretty good sports shop you may find stuff in you haven't seen anywhere else. There are also plenty of shows to check out here as well. I saw Chris Angel and it was a great time. I did not stay or eat here so I cannot speak on those topics. If you get the big smoothie drinks from Bally's there is a location here to refill!
Well we got to stay here for a total of $68 for  3 days and 2 nights, so I can't complain much.. . I just recommend you be aware of the following:. . 1. Early check in fee. Check in is at 3pm. If you want to get in earlier even if your room is available you have to pay $22.40. . 2. Resort fees. For each person you pay $22.40.. In return you gain access to the pool, access to the fitness center, free daily paper, free printing of your boarding passes, free local and long distance calls and the coupon book.. . We used the pool, the fitness center, and the phone.. . In terms of the coupon book, there's $20 credit for dining (limited to certain bars and restaurants) and complimentary entrance for two to the LAX club in Luxor. Those were most applicable to us.. . 3. Check out is at 11am. Make sure you're not to hungover.. . We were only in the room to sleep and shower, and since we only had to pay the resort fees and early check in, it was worth it.. . I still don't understand the early check in fee and resort fees. The room was already ready, the pool is already there, and not many people use the fitness center. It's not like I inconvenienced you, Luxor and MGM properties!!!. . Anyway, at least the room was clean.. . Until next time, watch out for hidden fees!
A great hotel for wanting to get the full Vegas experience. Nightclubs, bars, gambling, shoppes, and immediate access to the strip leaves little to be desired. Plus it's a giant pyramid so it looks cool.  Also, when you are on the strip and struggling to find your way back, the top of the pyramid shoots a huge skylight up in the air that makes it really easy to find your way back.
well, last time i was here, was like 10 years ago.  just walked around, and noticed they've eliminated ALL of the Egyptian themed ANYTHING throughout the casino.  It's all modern and clean now.  So it lost its weird charm.  Even the reception area lost its big statues.  WEIRD.  I mean, the people who go to Vegas and stay at Luxor, expect Egyptian themed stuff, right?  If they want classless class then they'd stay at Cosmo.
At least it's cheap.  Apart from that, get your shit together, Luxor.. . We did "pre-check-in" at 12 pm and were told that we'd be texted our room number.  That never happened.  I had to call the front desk and get my room number manually, which caused us to have to walk around aimlessly and unnecessarily for hours in the 100 degree desert heat.  Yeah, there's early check in, but they charge an extortionate fee of $20 for that privilege.  FYI, my friends checked in at 2pm without having to pay a fee.  Meanwhile, we were waiting for our text that would never arrive.. . The $20 food and drink credit advertised on Expedia is a scam.  It's given to everyone and doesn't work anywhere you'd actually want to eat (the buffet, the pyramid cafe).  . . As for checkout, I'm actually not sure if I'm checked out yet.  I tried using the link emailed to me, but the website was down.  When I called the number, I got the hotel's main line.  What a joke. I finally was able to navigate the menus to the express checkout option, which tells you to leave your name and number with a promise to send you confirmation later by email or US MAIL!!!  I'm still waiting for that confirmation.. . What a terrible experience.  I won't be back, and I certainly won't recommend Luxor to anyone.  Shell out the extra $20 and stay at MGM.
We went on a trip hear for anniversary the place was cheap for what we got. We has a nice big suit and I think I feel in love with the large tube. For are budget it was nice not amazing not suck just nice.
Only cool thing about this hotel is how it looks from the outside. We booked last minute and probably got the cheapest room. But it was still 140. The room was like an ok roadside motell. No wifi. Also this is a party hotel. I would stay here again, but not for that price.
Amazing hotel. I will definitely stay here again. The rooms were very spacious and clean, and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. The location is perfect too... you don't even need a rental car if you stay at this hotel. It's in the center of the Las Vegas strip... everything is within walking distance. I really could not find anything negative about this hotel, expect for the fact that parking can get very crowed at times. Valet parking fills up very quickly on Saturday nights.. and sometimes the check-in lines can be extremely long. But besides that, I totally recommend it.
We stayed here for 1 night at the beginning of a cross country trip.  Family of 4 (kids 6 & 11).  Didn't plan to gamble, but wanted to stay someplace fun & a bit luxurious.. . Check in had very long lines (actually, pretty much everything in the hotel had long list & long waits).   We had to wait 20+ minutes to check in.  Like others have said, be aware of the fees (although it seems to be a Vegas thing, not specific to the Luxor).  . . We did NOT get a good price (it was a last minute reservation, original reservation was lost), felt very taken advantage of, especially after reading the prices others got and the problems we had.  . . We had to go to 3 different rooms until we found one where the AC was working.   Very annoying, especially because there was a wait each time we had to go back to the desk.  We were jet lagged and it is a long walk to each room.. As an aside, whatever cleaning supplies & scents they used gave my son & I bad headaches. . . In addition, my son lost his 3DS XL in one of the rooms we had to go to when checking in and it has never turned up.  We filed a Lost & Found report, but have not heard anything and I'm concerned its gone for good.  Disappointing.. . Got accosted by time sharing people in the lobbies every time we went through hotel.  Offering 3 free nights in the future if we would listen to the sales pitch.  Very annoying.. . Did find most employees to be very friendly and helpful.  . . Won't stay here again.
You basically get what you pay for.  The room doesn't offer free wifi but only on the 1st floor.  Bring your own toothbrush and toothpaste because they don't offer it either.  The rooms are small and the AC is noisy. They run on those old AC system where you have to turn the knob to switch it on and off.  The tv channels are horrible! They don't even have premium channels, which I don't understand.  They do have a cable cord for the rooms if you bring your laptop for internet.  The pool is pretty nice and the sound system is pretty weak.  This is more oriented towards people on a budget and families. Again, this is a pretty good deal if you're on a budget and just need to stay one night due to you missing your flight in the morning or can't change your plane ticket like I did.
This place is sort of like a dump compared to the other casinos, but it has your basic needs if all you want to do is shower and sleep. I would give it four stars but in all honesty it can be a long walk from this place to the strip, so location is meh.
We'll it's cheap. It's dirty. And I'm pretty sure it's run by the illuminati.  Just kidding, but this hotel is obsessed with pyramids (even the soaps are pyramids...), also the chris angel show is here. DO Not waste your hard earned money on cris angel, everyone I know who's seen it says it's a waste. . The crowd is younger people who go here bc it's cheap and sketchy people. . The rooms look like attics. I think everything in the Luxor is dirty but this is coming from someone who is anal about cleanliness. So my advice is look at the hotel from the strip, that beam of light is beautiful but don't stay here unless u get a great deal, or just don't give a F about where you sleep.
We checked into our hotel room and thought it was okay but needs a bit of an update.  The price was right though so we can't complain.We went during peak season and paid about $160 per night plus the resort fee. It would have beenfine except we were charged twice for the resort fee, once through priceline and again at the front desk. The buffet was good and the pool was nice. We honestly enjoyed this hotel a lot and would stay again.
When we checked in at the front desk, the guy was very nice and accomadating but guess what? He dropped my girlfriends ID near his feet whick took us 20 minutes to figure out. After a 8 hour drive, that can be annoying.. . Luxor seemed a lot nicer when I was 12, now its just so-so. I feel like theres just something off about the casino; like the dealers dont want you to win-its hard to explain, youll see if you get here. Flamingo and excalibur peps were way cooler-especially Flamingo. . . Gym was cool, food is par. . . **hint: Play the electronic 2$ crap machines. These are the best odds and most fun thing to do there. You wont have meddling dealers in your face or drunk peps breaking your juju. Poker tourneys run all day and theres always a 1-3 no limit game going. Its not a  cheap game though, bunch of over-zealous tourists from all over.. . Cmon field!! Hope that helps, good luck ;))))
Chris Angle show is SUCK. Simple tricks and a lot of talking. Don't waste your money on that. The hotel elevator is horrible. However, Jabbawockeez show was good so 3 stars for them and free room.
The hotel is awesome. There is a lot to do and the staffare very nice. My husband and I became Mlife members and we are loving it. The pool area is cool too. I am loving it.
The staff is very friendly and accommodations are ok. This place is cheap, you can't pay $75 on the strip and expect a 5 star joint, sorry people deal with it. If you want a clean room, nice people, and no bed bugs then you will be fine. You want roses, super soft do do paper, and gold plated tub then go somewhere else.
At check-in they wrote the wrong room number on my packet. Called hotel operator from hall phone and was connected to Security. They never showed-up. Called operator again, connected to front desk, they told me the correct room number and I was able to get into my room almost 45 minutes after checking-in. Had to ask for something for my troubles, received in-house buffet comp for two. Their buffet is pretty weak, but has chocolate milk...a blast from the past. It's a bit of a hassle to get from their monorail to the main Las Vegas Monorail, it would be better to stay at a place near a real Las Vegas Monorail station if that is your primary mode of transport. Nice, clean rooms. Stayed in a tower, not the pyramid, but didn't matter, was there for business.
The hotel is good but the buffet is horrible. My husband and I got sick after we left after dinner. Overall, I liked the room and casino. AVOID BUFFET!
I LOVE the Mirage and stay there everytime I'm in Vegas, but four guests on a Friday in August in way too expensive. Especially when I had a comped room available at the Luxor. So we moved here for our last night of a four day trip.. . All in all, it's not a bad place. We had a "Deluxe Tower Room" and you can tell it's slightly older, but not awful. For the price, it really seems better than what you would expect.. . The casino was great (and the tables treated us well), the staff were all super friendly and the buffet was good (at least for Saturday brunch).. . That said, it doesn't have that super clean feel that I love about the Mirage. It's definitely on the dirtier side, but I'd still stay here again if the Mirage rates are sky high.. . Valet could have been faster on the checkout side, but maybe they were busier than normal.
I will say casino is nice but their service is crap. The women who gave up us the wrong room floor and gave us an attitude when we were checking in. We got robbed as well. Someone with a room key came in my cousins room and took her two sons iphone. At 4 in the morning. Lucky, she woke up in time before they took her phone as well. HORRIBLE HOTEL! Do not stay there. You'll get the worst experience.
Got a decent deal for signing up for the players club. They fail to mention there is no wifi in the rooms only in the casino. Would have been good to know. Pyramid rooms are funky but nice.  No closets but there is a wardrobe.  If there are two of you closet space is at a premium.
Great customer service in the begining. Nice floor layout, but the rooms were small, no fridge, coffee machine, probably wont stay here again but would like to cpme see the shows.
Hotel room seems comfy enough. The standard room is similar to any other double bed room at any other hotel I've ever stayed at.  Disappointed that the TV channel selection did not include cartoon network to occupy kids while in the rooms.  Bathroom door had water damage at the bottom as if the bathroom had flooded at one point.  There is no tub,  only a stand up shower which is ok with me,  but maybe not other.  On the outside at night the hotel is beautifully lit. There is a large outdoor pool area that is open until 9 pm. The hotel/casino has a variety of restaurant and shopping choices within it like all the others.
When you book by other agency don't forget to make sure that you have the right room with nice view. They say the have free internet but not WiFi. The place overall is cool. Their blackjack is dumb. Haha I won about $40 starting with $1 only!! But i lost it in other casino. Enjoy your time.
Normally would stay at Mandalay Bay, but since it was last minute, and Mandalay at last minute booking is above $300.00/day, I thought Luxor would be a good alternative since it was half the price of Mandalay.. But I guess if you've had the best, it's difficult to demote.. Luxor is a two because of the following reasons:. 1. Location: 5/5 it's behind Mandalay Bay, and in the strip. 2. Customer Service: 4/5 OK; BUT there are time-share-style promoters hunting you at your every move, it's annoying. . 3. Ambiance: Good, like the decor at the lobby; magnificent Egyptian decor/style etc, but the whole place smelled of smoke; even our room that's non-smoking wreaked of smoke coming from the balcony. The structures (I don't know what you call them) that look like buildings within buildings below our room floor was super dusty, with trash that were left there (seemingly from a long time ago) were all dusted over.. 4. Decor: Great at the lobby, dated in the room. 5. Amenities: No wifi, no fridge, no microwave & NO coffeemaker in the room; wifi is only available at the pool area.. 6. Others: the buffet (The M Buffet) -- meh, I've had better. customer service there sucked.
We stayed at Luxor on August 2014 for 2 nights. I and gf stayed in pyramid deluxe room, whereas the rest of family stayed in the tower room.. This review is for the pyramid deluxe room.. . Hotel atmosphere is a little bit too dark for my taste, but what can you expect for a pyramid-themed hotel, really. . . The room is mostly clean, except in one area. We found that the marble table has a lot of bread crumbs (a little bit hard to see in the pic).... all the way down to the chair.. . Resort fee. I see people complain about resort fee. However, it is not am issue that is unique to Luxor. This seems to be the new 'custom' of Vegas hotel (started about 2 or 3 years ago), where the hotel management 'forces' customer to pay the fee that provide them access to the gym and the internet access.. . Bathroom was clean. Water temperature was responsive. Just remember!! Pyramid tower does not have bath up, as far as I know. It only has the stand-up shower.. . Bed was quite comfortable.. . As any other M-life hotels, Luxor provides you with coupon booklet that has discounts for food, play, show, etc. . . Overall, it was a decent experience. We had a comfortable stay for the amount of money we pay. If it was not because of the bread crumb on the table, I would've given it a 4-stars.
alright, not going to lie...i was totally hesitant to come to this hotel because of all these negative reviews lol (like so hesitant to the point where i was about to move my reservation to a hotel like PH) but boy was i surprised. Luckily my friends talked me into using my free rooms. VERY WORTH IT. . first off, i had comp'd rooms from the myvegas reward game. I was able to receive three nights for free!  I was booked for the pyramid deluxe room. When I arrived, yeah the line was long to check in but it went by fast. WILLIE checked us in. He was so welcoming. I even asked if we could get an upgrade--upgraded to a room to the west towers near the pool. AND to top that off he was able to waive our resort fee! By then, I was swooned. . . The room: The room was exactly how it was pictured in their site. Linens were clean, bathrooms cleaned, beds nice, and most importantly i saw no evident of bed bugs. Quite spacious i must add. Although no fridge or anything like that but the ice machine was near by. . . The only downside was us getting deactivated for our  room keys---that was the worst thing that happened lol. Other than that everything was good! I would totally come back--free or not. . . . Also, use the coupon book. We were able to watch the jabbawockeez (the coupon gave us a free shirt and discounted tickets. That show was amazing btw.. . Thanks for everything luxor!
I stayed here for three nights early in August for a conference. For the low, conference, weekday rate (that I didn't have to pay for) I would say that it was a decent value. That being said, I would not recommend this place for conferences, as the entrance to the conference area is the same path as the entrance to the pool area. The conference area bathrooms also share bathrooms that are placed near the pool, spa and gym entrance.. . As for the rooms, not too bad, as long as you're not expecting WiFi. The fact that the place uses an ethernet cable symbolizes how outdated the hotel is. On the one hand, it's nice because it means the internet is not slowed down by peoples' phones constantly downloading stupid crap. On the other hand, how many people are using devices that even have an ethernet port anymore?. . The Luxor is poorly lit, and it seems there's at least one flickering light fixture on each floor-- reminiscent of a horror movie. The pool is terrible-- too shallow, broken up into small sections as well. They constantly run out of pool chairs (perhaps it helps them rent the mountain of "premium chairs" they cordon off. What irked me the most was that the last morning I was there the water coming out of the faucet and shower had so much sediment (or something) that it was literally brown. When I called the front desk they acted like it was no big deal, told me to just let it run, and explained that it resulted from a water outage earlier. Right...
They gave me a complimentary suite upgrade which was nice! Mello vibe at this place which I like.
