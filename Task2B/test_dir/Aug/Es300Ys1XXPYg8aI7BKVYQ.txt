I loved the club but I have to agree with other yelpers about their horrible customer service; it's just plain horrible. The bouncers are trying to find any excuse to use the "LETS GO! You're getting kicked out!!...unless you tip me" I saw it happened and happened to a friend and almost happened to me. Luckily, the bouncer was so offended by me offering 5 dollars he told me just to get the hell away from him. But it's Vegas, so you gotta pay to play.
F--- this place. I would give them NO stars if possible. Should have some sort of disclaimer stating that paid admission does not guarantee entrance into the club. Stood in line for 2+ hours before finally deciding to cut my losses and bounce.
If you're a guy going to Vegas and thinking about getting into XS on girls night be prepared to wait at least 2 hours in the general admission line! We went over the weekend when Zedd was suppose to be playing but he canceled last minute due to "illness". XS offered to issue refunds but unfortunately i guess only to those people that didn't go in. Sucks for the rest of us eh? . . Anyhow the if you're not baller enough to drop a couple grand on table service and not on the guest list you'll need to wait through the Disneyland style queue. But hey if you also wanna be suckered by the bouncers or still wanna be baller you can pay off the bouncer to get into the "express line". That could cost you anywhere from $20-100 though. But hey this is Vegas money can buy anything right? . . The venue itself is pretty spectacular once you get in! It features a huge pool which yes people do jump into fully dressed or in there undies. Although be prepared to get kicked out if you get out of the pool soaking wet. Also be aware of them douches splashing everyone on the sides. Yes there are fights that break out randomly as we witnessed. . . The drinks are pretty standard and definitely pricey. But again this is Vegas so you gotta pay to play right! Cmon $5 for regular coke and $10 for a bottle of water too for those DD's! Cocktails and beers range from $10-20 as well. But hey if you got girls in your group and its ladies night don't forget to get them free drink vouchers! . . The music is a pretty much a mix of EDM but depends on the DJ spinning that night. Sadly we didn't get to see Zedd so we had some no name guy playing all night. The dance floor does get packed and watchout for them bouncers that will literally football style push everyone out of the way to make room for staff or the baller VIP table guests to get through. Yeah people be getting squished in the middle but oh wells its  Vegas right! . . If you're coming to see a specific artist play for the night definitely check XS's twitter or Facebook before coming! Otherwise go hit up Marquee or somewhere else!
I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed.  Always get in on a guest list ladies! And guys well sorry but you have to pay. I've seen Will.i.am here and Deadmau5.  Will.i.am was amazing! Deadmau5 not so much. If you order bottle service beware! Tons of "can I party with you?" Moochers. The bottle service girls always want more tips. 26% gratuity is included. Meaning they automatically make $120 off the top when you order a bottle. I've gone here with bottle service and without. You can go either way. I prefer to stay in the outdoor area. The inside is way too crowded. Super fun place would honestly recommend.
Unreasonably long lines. You have to tip to get in. They used to have a separate line for ticket holders, now it's mixed in with general admission. Waiting in line smelling people puke and farts is not worth my $50 plus all drink money spent inside.
Seriously fuck this place. Doesn't matter if you buy tickets ahead of time or not. The guys controlling the line deliberately keep the lines from moving to generate tips for themselves. Honestly, they're shameless. They count their "hard earned" money in front of the rest of us not willing to pay the $40 per person to cut.
First of all, there's a line to get into a much longer line. Buying tickets beforehand, really doesn't matter at this point. Unless your party consist of two people and/or you're willing to pay $20 (a person) to get into the express line, be prepared to wait a good two hours. It's. Ridiculous.. . The venue is beautiful. Packed with people (at least on the Saturday night that we were there) and there's a lot to keep you entertained. . . But by the time I got in, my feet hurt and I was grumpy from the wait - that killed it for me.
I want to first start out, this is a great place. Always have had fun here, have gone multiple times before and had good times. . . Last few times, I have been disrespected. Showed loyalty by using same promoter but each time I check in, talk to a promoter and have to pay a higher price. Also have been kicked out of line (being very respectful) due to not having my whole group. My fault of course but, I was early and with 15 girls and 8 guys (Bachelorette/Best Friend Birthday party) for overall of 18 girls and 8 guys. . . Was kicked out, in a rude manner. Wasn't given a chance to explain. Had to re-enter line and was kicked out again due to "bad behavior" because I "supposedly" wasn't on the guestlist line. Which I made sure I was multiple days ahead because I didn't want any problems.. . Moved back out towards the lobby multiple times and had a few friends of the party be upset and cry. Not coming here again due to bad service.. . Will definitely take my large party services to other venues and not recommend such a place due to being disrespected in such a manner. I will make sure I don't come here again especially in the coming years since I was a continual customer.
My favorite Vegas club. Wish they could steal the residents from Hakkasan. Love that you can go outside by the pool and still hear the show and watch what's going on inside on giant screens. Being able to go outside and come back in without missing anything is awesome. Best tip, if you stay at the Wynn or Encore you have your own entrance that has no line.
I live in Vegas.. I always have the most fun at this club. It's nice bc there's an inside and outside. If I get tired of being in one I'll go to the other =). I've seen skrillex and many others perform outside. If you are in vegas, thus club is a must.
So you think you can get in easily with pre-sale tickets?  Think again.. be prepared to pay off those greedy bouncers $20 extra for their "express" line.  Oh you don't have cash because you went during the night swim night?  Well too bad, they're going to make you wait 2+ hours in line no matter how full/empty the club is.. . I still love the club, but the bouncers need to go.  See my pictures of those assholes for more detail.
How to share you my experience so you can learn how horrible this experience was. If you told me to bring extra cash to bribe my way into the night club, then you should of told me on the ticket for the night swim! I easily could of brought more money to pay off your bouncers that didn't let anybody in the club!!. . XS use to work with pre-sale tickets, which meant we were allowed to get in without the hassle of staff asking for bribes to cut in line. We waited 2 hours to hear the same bounce say "get your tickets ready.." why? so we can stand in the same spot we did 2 hours ago? This has to be the biggest joke ever...... . . Check out the photos you can definitely see these bouncers asking for money just to go into this "express bribe pass lane" to get ahead of everyone else that has pre-sale tickets. Those that had pre-sale tickets just had to pay another $20 on top of their ticket to get into the front and skip this line.. . So you have 3 lines (1 for tables... ok, 1 for general admin and PRE-SALE tickets..., and 1 empty VIP LINE BRIBE PASS LINE) Clearly it does say something about the club. Thanks XS for making me have a horrible experience.
Straight up you are only get in if you pay your way in. Doesn't matter if you have a ticket or not if you don't wanna pay $50 a head plan on waiting at least an hour and a half.
I'm a local and have lived in Vegas for 6 months. Been wanting to go out with my boyfriend and hit up some clubs, but have found that it cost men so much to enter clubs. So, I went online and searched for Promoters and found Chris!! I wasn't for sure if it was a real deal or not, but decided to sign us up to go to XS last Sunday night. Got to the club early to make sure we didn't have to wait in a very long line. We were the second couple into the VIP side! A total plus there. . . The guest list check-in was at a door that let you enter the pool area as soon as you were checked in. I loved that. The pool area was so pretty and so unreal. Since we were there and checked in at 10, we had our choice of any of the lounges on the edge of the pool. Yet another plus! My boyfriend and I didn't realize it was Sunday Swim Night, so I was dressed in a dress and he was in pants and shirt. Lucky for him, they have a swim shop to buy swimming clothes inside of the pool area. He bought himself a pair of trunks and enjoyed the water. . . Since we can early, there wasn't many people yet and the music wasn't over bearing. We enjoyed just sitting and soaking our feet in the pool. Another plus for this club was that I was able to dance all night long in the pool and not have to wear my heels and kill my feet. We were able to sit whenever we wanted, without having to pay for a table. . . Met some amazing new friends that night. Amazing DJ with some awesome mixes. Love, LOVE, LOVE this club and will definitely be coming back here. Next time I will take advantage of the Swim and wear a swimsuit. . . A few cons that I noticed (but it didn't take away from our 100% fun that night).. . #1. They needed to have more people going around and gathering up the empty glasses. We shared our lounge with about 7-10 other people and the glasses really started to pile up. I had to get up several times and take beer cans and glasses to the bar myself. I didn't mind at all though.. . #2. After a few hours here, it got super crowded in the outside pool area, so people were back to back pretty much. Again we didn't have a problem since we had a lounge and was able to keep it for us and our friends. With more people coming in and out of the water, the walk area around the pool got very slippery and I noticed that people were sliding all over the place. Once the confetti started to fly and fall on the wet areas, it was really inconvenient for some and was getting caught and mingled in their legs. Several times I had to stop dancing to untangle the confetti from around my legs. No biggy for me though. I do think that they could have been better at cleaning the confetti from the slippy floor areas. Someone could've been really hurt. . . Other then that, I had the best night here in Vegas so far!! I totally am in love with this club. Thanks for making our night so fun.
I'm a regular Las Vegas "tourist" who always comes from California, and the past few times I've come, XS was not up to my standards. The inside portion is almost like a big auditorium, with a sloping kind of venue with a stage in the center.. However, the outside portion is amazing! I went last night and used Michelle as my promoter and, as long as you have an EVEN ratio (same number of girls and guys) then no one pays. I even got a free drink ticket! . Diplo was spinning last night and I had a blast! You could even go into the pool if you wanted to. . . Don't come here without being on a guest list though, and just know the guest list meeting is usually inside the encore by the meeting rooms there. . . Use Michelle tho, she's awesome! She gets back to you super quick! Just text her the night before or day of, and she can help your group get in.. And there's really no wait on guest list! . Instagram : Michelle_vegasnightlife . Phone number : (908) 770-3570. . :)
This review is for Sundays Xs Nightswim with Wolfgang Gartner. Man what was amazing site. It's just surreal to see half of the people wearing club attire , andthe rest wear swimwear. It's just whole different vibe on a Sunday. Xs nightswim has a cool,crazy, and chill atmosphere all at the same time. Hat's off to the Wynn amazing pool . A perfect place for the pool party. Beach Club by day, and Nightswim by night. For me the best is to get a cabana so you have your space to hang out, and going in and out of the pool.. Wolfgang threw down a crazy set. His up beat music was insane. People were splashing to the beat, and that was amazing site to see, so awesome. . . The bottle service was top notch. Great service very friendly. Highly recommend doing the Nightswim Sunday's. Definitely trying to go back before the summer ends, and if don't make it back, you'll see me back here next year.
We came here on a Monday night and had a lot of fun. It was a little hard to find because it was down the hallway, but it was kind of nice that it was in a separate area than the casino. Once we were in line, they were pretty efficient with checking guest list and getting us inside. . . Once we were inside, we grabbed some drinks and headed to the dance floor. It was nice that they had a dedicated area in the middle just for people who want to dance. There were quite a few people, but it wasn't overcrowded. It was easy to spot the restrooms and to make your way over to them from the dance floor. And the place had great airflow, so it didn't get hot inside the club.. . The first DJ was pretty good. Then another DJ started a set, and we weren't feeling it, so we left. My one complaint was that we had to walk quite a ways to get to the taxi stand to get a taxi back to our hotel.
This club is massive and awesome. The energy here is the place to be for a good time. I have been here a couple times on Sunday Nights and what a difference it makes to have the outside pool area open at night. Make sure you get there to avoid waiting in line for hours. This is not New York or Miami where you go out at midnight to a club...better be there by 10pm.
Not quite sure why this is one of the hotter clubs in Vegas.  They are very disorganized here, often with the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.  You can pay thousands here, and get very rude (and perhaps more importantly, confused) service.  Would not recommend this place for a bachelors party.
BEST CLUB! Was there last night with Zedd playing! Hung out mostly outside and dancing in the pool with our shoes off was so much fun! Amazing crowd of people, music was epic. Was fun watching people with their club clothes on and even suits jump into the pool and swim as the night went on, this place was out of control. Cant wait to go again!
I am utterly dissatisfied with the lack of consideration and care that the Club XS staff has for its attendees as well as the lack of organization. Last Saturday, August, 23rd, my wife and I were to meet with a group of our friends to celebrate a birthday. I called a promoter and we were put on the guest list for the night, however when we arrived, we discovered that my wife was only on the guest list and I had to wait in the general admission line, since only girls were put on the guest list for the night.. . We separated, and she had my phone so that she show the confirmation text to the host at the door. I then proceeded to wait in the general admission line for 2 hours, only to stand there and watch as the VIP host, Kalani, continuously accepted bribes from other people so that they could get in faster. All the while, the head of the line that I was in barely moved the whole time. . . In fact, the only reason it did move is because most of the people in front of me left out frustration or bribed the host to get in. Then, when I got up to the counter, the price was $150, which was obviously raised during the time I was in line. I don't understand why you would raise the price of admission for those coming in later. . . When I finally got into the venue, it was packed beyond belief, to the point that it was an obvious safety hazard. I stood in the entrance for about 20 minutes because I could not go anywhere. My wife finally found me there, but was almost unable to because when she was let into the VIP outside pool area, the host at the club portion of the club told her she would have to wait in the general admission line if she wanted get into that portion of the club or she would have to stay in the pool area since she basically got in for free. Why would an attendee on the guest list have to pay to get into another part of the club?. . When she found me we ended up leaving since there was no point in trying to find our friends. Our experience was a complete waste of time and money and I am very upset that I was unable to get what I paid for and the night was ruined because of mismanagement and greed. Also, we saw two girls get carried out in wheel chairs, and while I know their alcohol consumption is their own responsibility, the club XS is at least somewhat responsible for what happens to it's patrons. . . I understand this is probably a usual occurrence, considering it was Saturday night, but I still don't get how a club would allow it to get that packed every weekend.
Love this place! Beautiful place! Love the music, love the fact that you can go outdoors near the pool for some breathing room. Plenty of room to dance and reach to a bar. Good service. Saw lil Jon here which was awesome. Just love this place favorite club yet.
Went here for the first time this past Saturday and had an awesome time dancing all night with my girl friends and everyone there. We stayed outside near the pool but the music was still plenty loud and DJ Zedd was awesome! The venue was beautiful and the atmosphere/energy was great. Plus we each got a complimentary drink ticket so we didn't buy any drinks, which were probably super expensive anyway. But hey, it's Vegas!
This was the first time I have ever gone to a club and felt utterly disrespected. The staff has no consideration for the people waiting in line, even if you have already bought a ticket. After pre-ordering my ticket and waiting in line for more then 3 hours, they were still asking for extra money. Apparently the club was "full" but if I paid the security $20 more a magical spot would appear?! After finally getting inside at 2am, I barely had anytime to actually see the DJ and enjoy my time. I definitely will not be coming back.
XS is my new favorite club/pool in Vegas... and the world!!! Thanks 1st & foremostly to my go-to promoter Rachel @ XS (dont think twice, just call her: 702.557.4160), who is a true hustler and made sure we had everything we needed to have the hands-down BEST time in Vegas EVERRR!! Rachel is a one-stop shop when it comes to promoters, and we've worked with many of them over the years... you just give her the list of clubs/pool parties you want to go to, and she takes care of them all! (Or knows the best people who can). . I went with a 14-girl bachelorette party last weekend, and every single one of the girls said it was the best time they've ever had in Vegas! Most importantly, the Bachelorette sent a txt afterwards conveying her "deepest gratitude for planning and executing on the most amazing weekend of my life!!... I am having serious post vacation depression now!!". I mean, what more could a friend want for her bachelorette?!!  Several of us have been to countless Vegas [bachelorette or other] parties over the past years together, and they were all fun & awesome, but this last one was over the top... and I have Rachel to thank for helping us get there ;DDD. . She made sure we were taken care of at all the other pools & clubs we wanted to go to, outside of Encore's XS & Beach Club, because she has connections with other rave-worthy promoters at each hotel...  Rachel herself goes above & beyond to make sure the other promoters she sets you up with are equally as conscientious as she is, and she'll even check in to make sure they're on top of taking care of you!! . . A couple weeks before the trip, I texted Rach & asked her to put us on lists for several places.  She & her promoter contacts were able to get us free drinks at all places, upon entrance: Tao beach & club, Marquee, XS, and Encore Beach Club... They were even able to get us a free no minimum day bed at Marquee during a major event! People pay over $1200 for these! . . Advice:  follow each promoters' instructions (i.e show up with your group on time to clubs & pools) and stay in communication with them (i.e let them know if your group size goes down or up). They set everything up so you can make the most of your time (and $$$) in vegas, but it's up to you to seize the opportunity ;) . . About XS... (you know someone's customer service is so good, when you can't stop raving about them vs the actual venue haha)... but seriously, what an amazing place.  We chose to go on Saturday night to see Zedd, and it was sooo gooood! I recommend dancing in the outside area by the pool- the acoustics were awesome, you had a nice breeze, and could always cool your feet off in the water (which saved me from my heels!).  What can I say about XS, other than you'd have to experience for yourself.  We had so much fun, we danced non-stop from 11pm-6am and didn't even realize it! I had to literally be pulled away by my friends. And I honestly think the place makes everyone so happy- I was only able to meet the nicest, most positive fun peeps throughout my whole night there (even in the long bathroom lines!).  What a memorable time, despite all the alcohol ;p  . . I absolutely recommend all the above!!!
Best club ever!! I went there on a Saturday night and ZEDD was playing!!! The club was pack!! full of beautiful fun  people!! The people who work there treat you like if you were part of the Saudi Royal family, they are all about you and they do anything to make you experience Las Vegas night life to its  fullest, I want to thank my host Diego Diaz who got all of my buddies in and got us a the best table!! you should text him if you are coming to Vegas(702) 540-8923
Zero stars if I could,  dress code is not followed I called three times to see If guys can wear chucks they said no dress shoes only! The line for the guys was horrible the bouncers will RIP YOU OFF and try to squeeze you dry!! Wasn't worth it to me.
David Guetta. Ok, here comes the body guards, 2 hours late into showing, and still, ppl were packed in and starry eyed like sardines. XS was banking on star power to rake in the $, but this was borderline dangerous. Zero access to water, super super fire marshall crowded, grossed out drunk out of control, zero room to move pool area. umm..Classiness is a standard that starts classy and has to end classy. Overrated. . . On a quieter weekend, perhaps, though nothing to write home about. Pricey drinks, over-commoditized offerings, and a predictable crowd. . Classy clubs unite!
