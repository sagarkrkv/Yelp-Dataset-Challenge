Great customer service from Bobby and Dylan at 4 AM. Highly recommend the truffle chips, steak skewers, and Margherita pizza.
Ongelooflijk lekkere keuken!. De voorgerechten zijn fantastisch. Probeer de scampi's!. En de steak was subliem. Zelfs een "simpele" spaghetti with meatballs is hier ongelooflijk lekker!
Great food, great service, at a reasonable price for on the strip. Their calamari was probably some of the best  I've ever eaten! The prosciutto pizza was really good too! It's definitely worth a trip to the MGM.
This is one of those restaurants where everything is going to be delicious. . . We had the blue cheese chips, fettucine, pizza and wings. All of these can be very mediocore or poor if not done properly. All of these were excellent. . . The chips were crispy and the topping was abundant but not overpowering. The fettucine was al dente with an understated seasoning. The pizza was thin with flavorful toppings. The wings were crisp and delicious. Looking around at other tables revealed that all of the dishes looked to be excellent.. . The service was efficient and friendly. The location inside the MGM allowed people watching. The hours are convenient. What is not to like?
I wanted my first review on yelp to be a positive one.  I have worked at MGM for the past 6 years and this restaurant has been a staple in my weekly life.  The product is always consistent and wonderful.  I have tried the entire menu which consisted of amazing pasta dishes, fish specials, and great salads.  Just yesterday I lost the battery on my phone and they provided me with a portable iphone 5 charger at the table.  It's always the little things that make such a great experience.  I will continue to recommend the puck to all friends staying at MGM (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)
Options are few, but the food is delicious. The gf cheese ravioli was good times. The trio of cupcakes was also very good.
One of my favorites at the MGM Vegas.. . Usually come here with a big group of 12+ and the service is always impeccable and the food is always on point.  . . Last time I was there I tried:. -Heirloom Tomato Salad - awesome (not much of a salad eater, but enjoyed this one) . -Spicy Tuna Tartar - fresh and clean flavors. -Calamari - a great choice as usual.  . -Linguini with garlic, chili, and Grilled Shrimp - my favorite!  I get this every time.. . Also, their desserts are so delish!  I usually don't venture out of the chocolate zone, but I've experimented here, and my tummy has always been happy with my choices;  Beignets, Vanilla Creme Brule, and Apricot Crumble, all have been fantastico! . . A bit on the pricey side, but which nice restaurant isn't in Vegas.  At least you wont be disappointed by the food here.
cool yummy good grub, with a nice selection of non-alcoholic beers if i do say so myself.
The food was great. My wife and I both had the Chinois Chicken Salad and it was probably the best chicken salad we've had. The only items preventing a five star review was the stools at the bar weren't very comfortable and we had to flag down someone for refills. We would come back again.
My friend and I waited over 30 minute for a table here and were quoted 15.  Hostess sat numerous people behind us first.  Portions on appetizers were tiny.  I had a blackberry cocktail it was strong and good.  My entree was a sausage pizza variation.  The sausage looked like salami.  I've never had sausage look like that and I've been to high end Italian places before.  Food was good, but over priced.   $80 for a small pizza, one drink, one soda, lasagna and appetizer.   I wouldn't return to pay that much again.   Food was brought out quickly and wait staff was attentive.
I'm never too impressed w/the Wolfgang puck venues. On the plus side I'm never too disappointed either!  If you wanna be surprised by the creations of a chef you need to check Jose Andreas's restaurants. E' at Cosmo and Bazaar at the SLS. . Anyways The food is good here and seems fresh. Sometimes a little too much oil for my taste.
I don't know who does the hiring here but the STAFF is ALWAYS soooooo NICE! The Vibe is so cool.  They always play great music. The food is executed to perfection!  I highly recommend you try EVERYTHING!
Can I say LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUD? . . Holy guacamole, it was loud. Definitely not a good place for a first date or a meeting or catch-up-talk-story kind of place because it is open to the public but my boyfriend & I enjoyed ourselves, nonetheless. We were shouting at each other rather than talking cause it was so loud but we were laughing the whole time. It was fun. . . Now that you've been warned about the noise, onto the food. It's delicious. Seriously. The complementary bread and butter was yummy and they didn't hesitate to give us seconds once we were done with our first basket. Oh, and the servers were great! Very friendly and attentive. Refilled our drinks almost instantaneously. Okay, back to the food. My boyfriend got the Grilled Burger. It was huge, tasty, juicy and flavorful. He devoured it. . . I ordered the Jidori Chicken and Potato Puree with Veggies. I practically slurped that Rosemary Jus because it was just yummy. The chicken is pan seared and baked. Honestly, the juiciest chicken I have ever had in my life. Not dry or over-salted at all.. it was seasoned perfectly and I was sad after my last bite.. . Since we were locals, we ended with a complementary dessert to share. (They won't ask if you're local. Just tell them you are & they will be more than happy to hand you the dessert menu). We got the Beignets with Citrus Custard inside and Caramel Dipping Sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the citrus custard and would have loved for it be simply a vanilla custard but I liked it for the most part. . . The price is cheaper than most restaurants on the strip. I was looking for something that wasn't solely burgers but I didn't want to splurge too much so this place was a great choice. Will definitely be back someday!
This place is on point. Amazing food and service. Not very romantic or intimate but if you're looking for a truly delicious meal then I highly suggest you come here. I ordered the salmon, which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. It came with a tasty corn/ pico de gallo-esque salad. One word DIVINE. My bf ordered the burger which he also seemed to enjoy. My only critique is the not so intimate setting, but the impeccable food flavors and service totally make up for that! I cannot wait to come back!!!
Need a good feed before going to the hakkanas night club. . . We had the spaghetti with meatballs and spicy tomatoes. And the half chicken. . . The food was amazing. . . My spaghetti was amazing. The best I've ever had.. . My wife chicken, it does take a while to be cooked but the well worth the weight. Juicy and tender. . . Defiantly wasn't expecting this quality from here. AMAZING!!
