Charlotte has grown I remember when the airport was small now it's like a little city of it's own. I don't mind waiting for a plane here as they have plenty of places to eat and pass time. They made it look real nice and "purdee" inside so you feel like you're in a nice place unlike Newark or JFK which are boring as hell to me. I don't think the majority of passengers will be disappointed passing through here.
We stopped by this airport as a layover.  The terminal was quite modern and clean.  I liked that there were rocking chairs.  There were also plenty of food stands and stores.  That there are attendants in the restrooms is memorable.  The one I encountered cleaned the counters and greeted everyone who walked through the doors.  However, I could imagine the awkwardness of needing to use the stalls since the place where the attendant usually stood is directly across from the stall doors.
Because Charlotte, NC is a growing city, everything is new, glossy, and ready for business from those who are just taking up roots in the city. As a result, CLT is receiving the same "tear it down and start again" treatment.  This airport is special enough to have a Pinkberry considering not many of the airports house their own Pinkberry.  Of course they have a Chili's, a Mexican restaurant, and a shiny food court.  The place is not as large as Dulles International but from all of the construction, I would say it is well on its way.  To sweeten the pot even more, the people who work here are very helpful, patient, and professional.  You will not get attitude from the employees like you would at JFK.
To-date, I have had no issues with Charlotte Douglas International Airport, lol. I've only had layovers here and can't comment on the check-in experience. However, the food court space has a decent selection of foods so I'm content.
Love it, never have any problems and super easy to get around. Plus, the new construction has added a lot of new and pretty cool parking spaces whoohoo:]
Went on several websites to find a map that shows a baggage claim area location. There isn't.  Called several airlines they were unable to find anything. What's up with that.
Charlotte Douglas parking has been under construction for years - it's a nightmare. The valet companies are terrible and waits have been up to an hour even if you decide to splurge for convenience and avoid the construction. The airport is overcrowded, we've outgrown our space.. . That said, the rockers are cool. It's clean. . . If you flight out of E, bring your walking shoes.
I have no idea how things are on the Departure side of Security.   But, for anyone picking up a passenger here, this is one of the worst airports I can imagine.  Other than a Starbucks (w/o seating) and a magazine shop, and a "Cafe", there is nothing.
Ideally I'd give this airport 3.5 stars, but since that's not possible, I'll round up..... . My family and I have been here multiple times in the past two years, as this airport is a hub for US Air. We've been here when it's been quiet and also when it's been teeming with people. When quiet, it's lovely: there is an airy, open central food court that has a lot of light and open space. There are some neat art pieces and mobiles/suspended kinetic sculptures which are cool, and rocking chairs in which to relax. The airport's signage is clear and everything is really well-marked. The airport itself has always been really clean whenever we've been through it. There are many bathrooms and all are clean, too. Each bathroom has an attendant who offers mouthwash and mints and various supplies (you either appreciate or don't, these bathroom attendants. For me, they've all been pleasant, wishing mea nice day, and there's never been pressure to use their supplies or tip them, so I don't mind them. I find them to be a throw-back to an earlier, more refined time. I can understand others being off-put by them, though).. . What's not so great is the lack of stores and better restaurants here (this can be problematic when you have a longer lay-over here), and how the place is a total cluster-f**k when it's busy. It just seems like the US Air terminal isn't large enough to accommodate all the people they service at busier "rush hour" times. I've seen people literally trip over each other, trying to catch connections, when it's busy. The terminal perhaps should have been made larger or wider, so more people could more safely move about.. . (As a side note, I think it foolish to downgrade this airport's ratings due to flights being delayed or cancelled, as some reviewers have done. The timeliness of flights run by all the various airlines is often - usually - not controlled by the airport. That's like blaming a mall for one of it's store's questionable return policies. It's not the mall's fault. Just my two cents worth!).
I've only ever had layovers here so I do not know how parking, etc is. Lots of different shops and food places and the bathrooms are always clean because they have attendants. Depending on what gate, you may have a good walk ahead of you so be prepared.
Very nice for a regional airport. Wasn't too crowded at all. First time I have been to this airport and I enjoyed it a lot.
one of the best airports for comfort in the country ,  food, drinks, places to sit all over   I always make it a point to fly through Charlotte when I can compared to Atlanta its a breeze !
Great airport... travel out of it very often. Right now, it's been a challenge getting in and out if you're self-parking. TIP: Have someone drop you off! The airport is undergoing major changes with lots of construction... which will make the airport much more efficient. . . On the whole, the airport here in Charlotte is clean, easy to navigate... no problems! . . TIP: It's crazy busy on Sunday afternoons and Monday mornings!
Everything good in this airport is RUINED by the obnoxious level of loud music playing by terminal D7 at "The Local Rustic Market". I was unable to talk on the phone or hear any announcements about my flight status over the music. I asked if they could turn it down and the manager suggested I walk down the hall, away from my gate in order to be able to hear any announcements from the gate. Stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion.
I had the worst time finding one of their long term parking lots. I felt like I was going in circles the whole time. It's a little run down and could definitely use some upgrades.
I love this airport! I always have connecting flights here. They have a great food court and they are packed with lots of shops and places to eat to help past the time. . I always stop at the body shop! It's also very clean and easy to navigate!
Since I travel so frequently, and this happens to be my home airport, I like it.  I park at Parkngo...with or without a reservation.  You barely have time to put on the parking brake before the staff is there with the van to carry your bags to the shuttle.  The airport itself, I like that too.  I love the wine bar Beaudevin.  Great staff, atmosphere and food.  And of course, the wine!  You don't feel as though you're at the airport.  And of course, love our rocking chairs!
The airport is large which means that you will most likely be walking quite a ways to get to your gate.  That being said, it's a well organized airport with clear signs for guidance.  The bathrooms are clean and have attendants who offer toiletry if needed.  . . I love the rocking chairs sprinkled throughout the airport.  It forces you to slow down and take a breather.  There are plenty of food options in each gate area, not to mention 3+ Starbucks locations to waken you up.  . . All in all, a nice airport.
This airport will one day not be under construction and will be built out to service the growing population in The CLT area. For now, any flight after noon is more than likely delayed and don't let your plane arrive early-you will sit on the runway until the ground crew is off break. . . The positives - very clean, always friendly folks and usually not hard to get through TSA checkpoint.
Been in three airports on our trip to North Carolina. I know it's summer. What happen to the air conditioning. They've lied if its about being GREEN. It's about the other green!!!
Oh my gosh is this airport huge. I got in on an hour delayed flight out of Knoxville, which only gave me 20 min to run from B terminal all the way to E terminal. There were so many people and our flight, every seat was filled going to Detroit. I had no place to sit while waiting at my gate, people were sitting on the floor...no thank you. As tired I was that night, I just stood and waited. The boarding process took over 30min, and that's when I say thank goodness for first class! First to board and get your carry on luggage squared away, and the first to leave the plane upon arrival.
As I fly a lot to Pensacola, Florida, I am always making a transfer at this airport. Wether my lay over is 20 minutes, or 2 hours, I am always entertained during the time I have to wait.. . There is a starbucks in every terminal, which is fantastic because after my first flight,  I am always exhausted. In the main terminal, there are tons of food options, as well as some shopping. I really enjoy the stir fry place in the food court, their spicy options are top notch.. . The bathroom attendants at CLT are SO friendly. They will make sure you are satisfied with the cleanliness and keeping of the restrooms.. . My only advice is to make sure you leave yourself enough time to get to each terminal, since this is a huge airport and very spaced out.
Got nuthin against it. Pretty big, usually runs on time. Seems like they have a lot of new businesses coming in that are good, especially restaurants. You have to take a bus to the rental car station, though, which is a bummer. And there is a lot of construction going on here in 2014.
The most ridiculous airport for connections. . . New union rules have imposed a ground shutdown if there is lightning within a mile if the airport. . . You can be siting on the tarmac only a few feet from a gate for over half an hour and not able to get out. In the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding. . . Once the shutdown is over your connecting flight is ready to go, you've lost all your connection time, they've bumped you off the flight and now you're on a flight 2-3 hours later. Even if your connecting plane is still at the gate they won't wait for you or let you on. . . Has stupidityreached a new all time high?
Great little airport. Now direct connection to Europe. Live piano music in terminal. Us airways hub. Rental car shuttles run every few minutes. Lots of charging stations for electronic devices. Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.
Nice airport,  but really- with all the nice amenities like rocking chairs and moving walkways - but no free wifi?. . And can they do something about the annoying high-pitched beepers on the courtesy shuttles?
Even though it is still in construction, it is still one of the best airports to travel. Easy in and out, perfect size!
I really liked this airport.. . For some odd reason this was my connection lay over airport both on my way from Dallas to NYC and Newark to LAX.. . The airport is bright and clean and offers lots of shopping and dining options.. . I really liked the Mexican tequila bar. On my first layover I had a strawberry margarita that came in a cool plastic shaker. I was able to . (discreetly) bring it on to my connecting flight with me. . . It's easy to find your way around, and staff here were all friendly. I almost wished my layoverwas longer the last time, so I could of checked out even more.
Terrible airport for a layover. Walking from E40 something over to B6 should not be do laborious and definitely would be hard to do successfully with any shorter of a layover or if my other flight had not landed a smidge early. Not to mention half the moving walkways were not working. Will be avoiding layovers here in the future.
