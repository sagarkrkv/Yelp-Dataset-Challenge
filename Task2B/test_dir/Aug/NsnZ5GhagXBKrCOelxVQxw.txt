Not often do you find a place with excellent service and amazing food. Our waitress Vanessa was on top of everything, if I needed anything I could turn around and she would already be on top of it. Jason also took time to make sure everything was going how it should, which of course it was. I will definitely be back and will highly recommend it to others. Since living in Vegas I've been to a lot of nice restaurants down on the strip and this place knocks it out of the park. I have nothing bad to say.
Sushi samba is the first place we go when we check in to the Palazzo to get a bite.  Staff is fast and friendly and gave us a personal touch (free bee sample) when they heard we are repeat customers.  Sushi samba is gorgeous inside and full of energy, but not loud or obnoxious.
I really liked this place. A different twist, but still tasted familiar. Nice decor without trying to do too much. There was a lot on the menu so getting through it would take a couple trips. . Service was great. Our waiter was very good at explaining the concept, and made it enjoyable. . Drinks were excellent. . It was memorable, and would like to try it again sometime. I didn't really find it to be an awesome place, but like I said it has a really large menu and it deserves a couple try's.
Yum!! I always leave SS looking forward to my next visit. The table always enjoys a wide variety of dishes, my fav being the yellow tail with jalapenos and lemongrass, lobster tacos, miso sea bass and this last visit we tried the ribeye tobanyaki and it was out if this world. Even though stuffed One of my friends threatened to order another bowl of the awesome coconut rice just to not leave an life of the sauce the meat was made in because it had to be eaten.. . We had an extraordinary server that evening but I unfortunately I can't remember his name!! He reminded us of marky mark in a way.
I went here and it was so good, I went again the next day.. . I recommend going on a non peak hour. The place got loud during dinner and it diminished the experience somewhat. We went for a late lunch and things were slow, we could hear each other speak, the waitress took her time with us and made several solid recommendations.. . The second time, the food was still excellent, but it was loud and not very 'zen'. Waitress was frazzled and not as focused on us.. . The food was fantastic both times. Very unique fusion of Japan and Brazilian food that I highly recommend.
Superb.  Best Cod I have ever had.  Peruvian corn delicious. Crab fantastic.  Price is a little pricey but when doing sushi like dishes its to be expected to a certain degree. Letting the server bring you out random dishes, is a cool concept. The drawback is they say if you don't like them they will take it off your bill however they bring out usually 1 for the table and chances are everyone will try something meaning there will be nothing left to take back so its kind of a con because there is only one serving per person.
Let me start out by saying that my husband and I have attended Sushisamba many occasions when we stay in Vegas and have never been disappointed. This time we were celebrating our 20th year wedding anniversary. We had reservations and we're promptly seated. Our server Philip was AWESOME!!! Super attentive, friendly, and all-around great personality. Specialty drinks were concocted just for us and a Happy Anniversary complimentary dessert was served by the manager himself. What keeps us coming back to this place is the truly wonderful vibe, great atmosphere, the VERY attentive service, and of course... The food! Top notch thru and thru!
Came here with a group of 8 to celebrate my 30th birthday. Made a reservation and we were sat 25 mins late. Didnt exactly start off great but the food and wait staff were great. Sushi came out pretty quick and the steaks were cooked to perfection.  Drinks seemed a little over priced for nothing special.
Amazing service, amazing food!. . We were having a late night second dinner craving so we decided to hit up Sushi Samba that was conveniently at our hotel in the Palazzo.. . Enjoyed the dumplings, chicken teriyaki, and we tried almost every roll here. Each one was excellent.. . I don't eat pork, so the chef actually created a chicken based Ramen for our group which we all LOVED. It was so flavorful and comforting and really hit the spot. This was my favorite dish here. I'd come back for this!
Great flavors but we were still hungry when we ate there and we were dissapiinted for how little we got...get lots of appetizers!
Jeff and Vanessa were amazing.. We came in with a large for Magic the catered to us above and beyond. All recommendations were amazing- we did the family style dinner. Definitely way to go. They are fantastic ask for them and you won't regret.
This place is a lot of fun, especially late.  It's noisy, but everyone is having a great time.  We had so many things it's hard to remember all of them, but the oyster shooters are a must.  Lots of inventive, cross-cuisine dishes too.  The service is great too, and the pacing of the food was perfect, in spite of the fact that it was packed.
This place is amazing. I went here with a group of 10 and the waitstaff was extremely attentive.  Try the prime rib with truffles and the seabass with miso! I would definitely eat here again!
Great ambiance paired with an amazing fusion.
Great service and my favorite sushi spot. Ate there 2 times during my vegas vacation. Highly recommended.
Unique and delicious.  Cool atmosphere.  Exceptional service.  Maybe the best sushi I've ever had.
The food is subpar and pricey but the drinks are amazing. The hostesses are good looking too.
Stopped here for happy hour. Ordered the Wagyu beef gyoza and the shrimp tempura roll. Reasonable pricing. The presentation of the food was impressive and it was all delicious.
Portions for ants, food took more than 45min to come, one at a time, nobody had food at the same time. Over pricy and bad service
Dont go !!! Expensive, poor service, half the table was done with their food, the other half was still waiting for theirs. Incompetent waiters and waitresses. Dry, tasteless food.
