One of the few places in Vegas where the high prices are justified. Big portions, excellent steak, killer stone crab, and great service. Their Bloody Mary is the best I've ever had, and I've drank a lot if them.
Went here for my birthday dinner. The food was awesome. Ambiance was nice and quiet, classy place. It is located in the forum shops at Caesar. They have their own valet parking so if you aren't staying at Caesars, you should use their valet.. . I had the bone in rib eye. So tasty. Very good portion. Would order it again. We also had some stone crab claws for an appetizer. They crack the crab for you so eating it is simple. Tastes fresh and the dipping sauce also adds to it. We had sides to share: mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. These are definitely for sharing. One order should feed at least four people easy. They do give you a free dessert on your birthday with a candle, But no singing at this classy establishment.. . Overall great food. On the pricy side, so best reserved for a special occasion.
High end food right off the Strip.  Great ambiance.  Service level of fine dining.  Our waiter Thomas was great.  Easy to hit $100 per person of you have a drink or two.. . My wife and I got the Pacific Crab.  Honestly, it was good..  but not great.  Didn't feel the taste justified $43 for the entree but taste is a subjective thing of course.  For me, the taste was more Joe's Crab SHACK than fine dining.. . Overall it's a solid restaurant.  If I returned I'd skip the crab and try the steak.
Ate here last night.  OMG!!  The food was delicious!  I had the crab bisque..amazing!  Creamy with lovely flavors.  And the seared sea scallops with Jenies mashed potatoes. Delicious!  The scallops were served on two slices of pork belly that was fried to perfection.  It was a lovely pairing of flavors.  I highly recommend this place and will be back during our next trip to Vegas.  I think our waiters name was Thomas.  I wish I could remember.  He did a fabulous job as well.
Joes is old-timey. It's an old warhorse of Vegas, and well....it might not be at the top trend of 'look how cool we are' but it still kicks ass when it comes to delivering a meal. I've only been once and that night was with my family and a few family friends. We'd started at the bar drinking and had spent the entire day drinking and continued drinking...so there might be a bit of a memory lapse here...because we ended up drinking at Casa Fuente right after too. . . Joe's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas thus far, and absolutely one of my favorite steakhouses I've ever been too (I'd say second favorite behind a Kansas City place). We did just about everything off the menu. Everyone save for myself got crab appetizers (I don't do seafood) . . By then, I'd had a few scotches in me and we were opening up the wine. This was a big trip for everyone; trade show for me, trade show for dad, youngest brother just turned 21. We'd been planning on this trip for over a year as it was the first time all of us had been together since last Thanksgiving. . . Joe's is the go-to place for many in workspace my dad is in; they've been going here for close to 20 years. Hilariously enough everyone in the industry basically was there, either eating on the 'exterior' area or in the actual restaurant. I'd wager some of the staff probably got to see really expensive knives :/. I was in town for SHOT, so I was exhausted as hell. . . This place basically propelled what was an amazing trip into one of the best family vacations any of us had been on, and that's including trips to the Caribbean and the EU. Why, you ask? . . Service put up with us because half of us were well-dressed inebriated mid-20-something kids hanging during trade show season on a Saturday night. Our server, who's name I do forget, was fantastic and she did her job well. Right up there with what you expect for this town, if not more. . . The steak is the best steak in Vegas I've had thus far. Sure, haven't been to Robuchon or Delmonico...but hearing anecdotal stories from family/friends most everyone continues to talk up Joe's. Every single male at our table ordered the NY Strip because that's how you do a damn steakhouse. We ordered about every potato option I think, and most of the veggies. . . Nothing made it out alive. I seriously watched my brother cry happily in the corner as we were all having a meal none of us were going to forget. Mind you, we're from KC and we eat out a lot....we've had it nice and it's hard to impress every member of my family. This place was nothing new to the older crowd, who were all having their favorite steak in Vegas already, but my two brothers and I were having an experience. . . Basically; Joe's definitely is one of the best steaks in the country. . . Going to Casa Fuente afterwards and then to some electronica concert at the MGM made this one of the best nights ever. . . 10/10 will eat at drunkenly again after playing with guns and knives and stuff all day.
Great service and do yourself a favor and try the Chilean sea bass. Out of this world!!!
Went to Joe's the first night of my trip for a friends birthday dinner. Our server was very knowledgable and on point with her suggestions. . . For appetizers we tried the ceviche which was delicious and we all ordered a cup of the creamy crab bisque. Oh my goodness this was the best tasting soup I've ever had in my 24yrs.. . Dinner I order a combination of a petite filet mignon and kind crab legs. The crab was fresh and delicious and don't get me started on that filet. Perfectly cooked and so tender. Melted in your mouth like butter. Our server gave us a complimentary brownie for my friends birthday which was a nice ending to the meal.. . Overall it was one of the best meals that I've had in a while and I'm glad to know there is one in Chicago!
My favorite steak & lobster place since 2001.. so there! Come visit them for steak and lobster, and try their stone crab legs appetizer as well! SIMPLY THE BEST!
Fantastic meal! Best restaurant Ive been at in Vegas. The food and service here is outstanding. When you want to go out for a nice, yet pricey dinner in Vegas, this is the place to go.. . Went out to dinner with my G.F. for our "nice" dinner out on vacation and we read so many good reviews of this place, so we had to go. All the good reviews do not lie, this place is amazing. We started with the 5 large stone crabs as an appetizer and were very very good. The mustard dipping sauce that comes with it works very will with the crab, but dont overdue it. Your ordering a $65 appetizer so enjoy the crab, not the sauce. I would have loved to see how big the two colossal stone crabs were that cost $85.. . For the main meal, we had the 12 oz. filet mignon and the 16 oz NY strip. Probably the best steak Ive ever had. It was cooked absolutely perfect and the steak was like butter. Amazing!! For the sides, we split a half order of the mashed potatoes and the roasted corn. Both were excellent! . . This was the first time Ive been to this restaurant, but it is now our spot when we are in Vegas. Dont get all hyped up on going to the "big chef name" restaurants, when you want an amazing meal, this is the place to go. The reviews are correct, this place does not disappoint at all.
My wife and I have been coming here for years and Joe's has never let us down. Their steaks melt in your mouth and the cracked crab is always amazing. We always top our dinner off with their Key lime pie! Tonight I had an Ahi steak and it was a great change from my usual steak. I highly recommend, their service is always spot on!
Went here last night for my oldest 21 birthday- we arrived early with our stomachs on central time. Food,service and atmosphere was top notch. We had some amazing $29 special that included even dessert.....special, special time for us at Joe's. They did it right
Always the best experience, love to come here every time I make it to Vegas.  The go to spot for sure.
I am from Miami, The original location of Joe's stone crab and the Vegas location did not disappoint. It was packed but not impossible to get in like the one in South Beach. The stone crabs were amazing. Expensive but you already know if you are going to Joe's you are paying top dollar for amazing food. Everything from the bread to the salads and steaks was amazing. I highly recommend the south beach peach drink if you are into fruity cocktails. The waitress was polite and attentive and took very good care of us. I spilled some ketchup on my white shirt and I had 5 different members from the staff bring me seltzer water, a wash cloth and some stain remover. We definitely plan to go back. Those stone crabs are to die for and worth every penny.
We went there and the Stone crabs were good.  A bit pricey ($42.95) but good.  My wife ordered the tenderloin sliders.  The meat was very flavorful....but a lot of bun.  I ordered the Tuna steak and it was good.  Not the best I ever had but good.  Our waiter, Robin, was really good until a table of 10 was seated next to us.  At this time, we were pretty much blown off by him.  I rewarded him with a 10% tip for blowing us off.
We found Joe's on Yelp and decided it would be the perfect place to have dinner on our Vegas trip, to celebrate a couple birthdays. Between the 4 of us we ordered filet mignon, lobster, Caesar salad, and fish n chips. As far as sides you have to try the mac n cheese. TO DIE FOR!! All together, including 2 rounds of beer, our bill was about $250. . . Now I am not usually one to spend too much money on food but Joe's was worth every penny. Everything from classy ambiance to excellent service to great tasting food. The warm chocolate cake a la mode that came out as a birthday surprise didn't hurt either ;)
My first visit. It was the best dining experience of my life. Our waiter's, Stephen, attention to detail and pampering was the best. He constantly monitored our pace of eating and drinking. We requested the crab bisque to be split into two bowls and he accommodated us without a blink of an eye. He was awesome! The food was delicious. The crab bisque was very tasty.
I have eaten here 4 or 5 times in the past year or two, and Linda is an AMAZING server! If you go in you must ask for her. I am not a huge fan of stone crab, but they do have a great selection of seafood from oysters to halibut. Always been happy with the dishes.. Only disappointment I have had was the last server we had last week. She was very short and rude. Dropping the menu on the table and telling us the specials were on there. Very bad service. Until she saw that we were willing to spend money there. Both of us being servers, we were very disappointed. . Either way, I will be back for sure! Make sure I will go when Linda is there! ;)
Outstanding restaurant!  Everytime we go here we are never disappointed.  I always get the colossal stone crab.  The meat is tender and flavorful.  They crack the shells so it's easy to get to the meat.  You can eat the crab straight, with lemon, or dip it into a mustard based sauce.  Either way is great!  It's chilled which makes it soothing against your tongue.  This is a must try!. . They no longer dry-age their steak.  They now wet-age their steak.  This new method of vacuum sealing their meat does not hurt the taste or change the complexity of flavor.  There still is a rich meaty like taste.  The bone-in is the best cut, especially when you get to chew on the bone.. . We also got Brocollini and Potatoes.  It was okay, but nothing special.  Finally, the Key Lime Pie is outstanding!  It's cold and it's creamy.  The flavors of the tart lime, creamy whipped cream, and textured graham cracker crust work in harmony together.. . I cannot wait to go again!
